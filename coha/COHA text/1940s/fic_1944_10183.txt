" There was a high whine that came into the air unexpectedly . It sounded quite near , as though a lot of planes were flying very high almost overhead . " There they are , " McWilliams said . " Put out that butt . " " Ca n't see a light in daylight . " " They can see smoke . " Anti-aircraft guns went off very near at hand , beyond the ridge that cut off the sea . The transports and their escort were going into action . The guns beat out a fast tattoo , in pairs , whumping their shells up into the air as fast as they could throw them into the breech and slam it shut . " Noisy , " McWilliams said .

One of the enemy planes , wherever it was , had dropped a stick among the transports . All the explosions , however , had sounded exactly like each other . The plane must have missed . The guns snapped on . Another stick came down , and this time a deeper roar went with it . Over the ridge a black mushroom of smoke raced toward the reaches of the air . That was no miss , no miss at all . The air rolled back across the little hollow . A hot wind struck the trees . " Hit something that time , " McWilliams said . " We 'd better sit tight here , " Tyne said . " There may be a few fighters around somewhere . I do n't want any fighters to catch me in an open field . " " I do n't want any fighters to catch me in an open field , neither , " McWilliams said . " I wonder what the hell 's happening down there now . " " Plenty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it , the way it was expected to be . This was what might have happened during the landing itself . Tyne found him/self thinking of the coast of France . He had never seen that coast , but he imagined that now it was just one long concrete wall , bristling with guns . They would set the water afire with oil , too . They would do everything they could . When that day came , Tyne wanted to be somewhere else , far , far away . This , in itself , was bad enough . And even this was mild . In this you knew where everything was . You were here and the bombs were there . I t all fitted beautifully together . You were here and the bombs were there . Nothing could have been simpler . In the transports men were being killed , but they were n't you . You were where you were and the men who were being killed were where they were . I t had even been worse in London . Then you knew where you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you had a grandstand view . The only trouble was that you could n't see anything . Very little is seen in war , anyway . Wars are fought by ear . " I 'd like to see that , " McWilliams said . The black column of smoke soared higher . Over the roar of the guns there was a series of minor explosions that were n't bombs but very likely were explodingammunition . There could n't be many planes in the sky , though , because only two sticks had been dropped ; not many planes , that is , unless they were taking their time and making several runs and putting them where they hurt . " Wonder where our planes are , " McWilliams said . " They 'll be along . " " They 're taking their time . " " They have a lot of it . " But there should have been air support . By rights there should n't be an enemy plane in the sky . Tyne could n't understand it . The only solution seemed to be that this landing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made somewhere else , and all the planes had gone there . The planes did , after all , have a long distance to come . With the gas a fighter got it could n't do much more than arrive , turn around , and go back . It must be that this landing had been a diversion . Yet the water was supposed to be jammed with ships . McWilliamshad said so , and McWilliams had seen them . It didn'tp32make sense . It could n't be that the planes had missed the bus . Another stick of bombs fell . The planes sounded lower . " Can I go take a look , Corporal ? " " You stay the hell where you are . I want you here . " The binocularswere absolutely useless . Tyne could see absolutely nothing in the sky . Puffs of ack-ack , that was all . But no planes . He was glad that the trees gave him some cover . You never could tell , though . Let the bombardier up there , whatever he was , be a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your dogtags . Unconsciously Tyne pressed his body into the earth as though he hoped the ground would gape open and swallow him . Earth is a marvelous thing . A man does not appreciate earth , just ordinary dirt , until he has been under fire . Then , when he feels that three inches of dry sod scraped up in front of his eyes gives him adequate protection , dirt comes into its own . Foxholes can be dug in it ; slit trenches can be dug in it . An hour 's work can make enough protection to outlast the worst possible bombingattack . If the hole is deep enough a tank will pass over it , and all the man in the hole will have to do is duck his head a little . And even when there is no cover , absolutely none , a man can feel life surging through him if he just hugs the ground . And he will feel that if he stretched out his arms he could draw in the whole world and hold it to his chest . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes , six of them , in two V 's , flying very high , looking completelyunwarlike , completely out of things . It did not seem possiblethat such minute instruments could do so much damage . They reminded him of stuffed swans that glide over a stage setting , or perhaps in a ballet . They were out of the picture . They held no meaning . They were too far away to hold any meaning at all ; one could not connect them with the bombs . Tyne had found them by following the ack-ack puffs . " I see the planes , " he said . " Six of them . " " That all ? " McWilliams asked . " Not many , is it ? You 'd think they 'd have a couple of hundred around up there . It just goes to show you . "  | " It just goes to show you what ? " McWilliams looked at him owlishly . " It just goes to show you , " he repeated . " It 's funny , " Tyne said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binoculars behind the ack-ack bursts , hoping to pick up more planes . There were none . " I tell you what , Corporal , " McWilliams said slowly . " I got an idea . What say I take the glasses and go over on the ridge there and take a look at the water ? We ought to know what 's going on , had n't we ? I think we ought to know what 's going on . " " We know what 's going on , " Tyne said . " There 's no point in it . " " You never can tell , " McWilliams said . " We 've got to be getting along to the platoon , " said Tyne . " You would n't go through an open field with those planes up there , would you , Corporal ? I would n't do that . " " No , I would n't either , " Tyne admitted . The anti-aircraft fire stopped without warning . Evidently the bombers were out of range . It was odd that they had passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that this landing had been a feint . The bombers had probably gone on after bigger game . There must be a more important landing taking place farther down the coast . A few odd pieces of shrapnel smashed down around them . " They ought to know , " McWilliams said . " Who ought to know ? " " The guys , " said McWilliams . " Suppose I went and took a look over the ridge . Maybe there 's a new landing coming off . They 'd want to know if there was , would n't they ? It stands to reason . " " Go and take a look , McWilliams , " Tyne said . " Go and take a look . Get it off your mind . " McWilliams grinned at him . " It 's just for the record , " he said . " I think it 's a good idea . " " Do n't hang around , though . Those bombers may be back . " Tyne handed him the binoculars . " Take a good look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge . He was exercising caution , now that there were planes around . McWilliams might have ideas , but he was nobody'sfool . Once he got an idea in his head it was hard to get it out . And McWilliams had an idea he wanted to see what was going on in the water ; the easiest way was to let him see . Tyne watched him crawling , and he could imagine his face . McWilliams'sjaw would be jutted out slightly and his mouth would be open about an inch . Tyne remembered McWilliams 's face on a day when it had looked just like that . It had been in Sicily , and McWilliams , as a runner , had come crawling up to a slit trench where Tyne was sitting . His jaw had jutted out and his mouth had been open . It was his special expression that he saved for crawling . He made it look hard . He was halfway across the open space to the ridge when the anti-aircraft guns opened up again , and when they did he hesitated for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture . He lay flat , trying to see the sky and McWilliams all at the same time . McWilliams continued his crawl . By the time he reached the ridge the third stick of bombs had fallen . Tyne could not tell whether they had hit anything or not . McWilliams sprawled on the ridge , legs apart , focusing on the ships . Once he turned around and shook his head violently . The movement was meaningless to Tyne . It could n't mean that nothing had been hit , because the smoke from some ship or other was still moving up the sky . Perhaps it was a signal that nothing was coming ashore at the time . A shake of the head could mean a thousand things . But Tyne could not think of one . Silence came almost like a clap of thunder ; the guns stopped as though a great hand had been placed over their mouths . A new note came into the air , high-pitched , fierce . Fighters . " Come on back , " Tyne yelled . McWilliams turned , waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head again . Far up in the sky the rattle of a machine-gun could be heard . Immediately afterwards a comet of smoke appeared high over the water . It described a painfully slow parabola toward the ground and then disappeared behindp35the wide cloud of smoke that was rising from the wounded ship . The air cover had at last arrived . The ships were holding fire for fear they would hit one of their own planes . McWilliams followed the falling plane with the binoculars as it appeared on the other side of the smoke and plummeted into the sea . When it had passed out of sight he turned around and waved his hand in a small , violent circle . It was his accolade . More machine-guns were sounding up in the sky . Tyne began to feel very uncomfortable . He wished that McWilliamswould come back , that he were in the woods with the platoon , that something would happen that would be right . The feeling was growing on him that nothing had been right so far . Everything was wrong . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , was wrong . The whole landing had been wrong . He felt , rather foolishly , as though he had come to a summer resort for a vacation , a summer resort that he did n't like . The people were not the kind of people he had expected to find , and there was a director of athletics who made him indulge in games that held no interest for him . Even the swimming was bad . He noted that his hunger , which had cut him a little while ago , had completely vanished . Now , on the contrary , he felt slightly nauseated , as though he had eaten too much . It was hard for the body to keep up with things . The body was a backward instrument . " Come back , McWilliams , " he called . McWilliams 's voice came across to him clearly . " In a minute , Corporal . " The planes moved across the sky . It was impossible to tell their position by the sound of their motors , but they seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a riveting machine far away . The sun was full up in the sky , glancing off the wet leaves , drying the dew . Tyne could feel that his knees , where he had been lying , were wet . " Come on back , McWilliams , " Tyne called again . He could almost hear McWilliams sigh as he took the binocu/tars from his eyes , turned his body around , and began the tedious crawl back to the hollow . Tyne saw the planes coming a long way off  --  three fighters , Messerschmitt i z o 's . They were coming along the coastline from the north , flying very fast , and very low . They could n't have been more than a hundred feet off the ground . He watched them coming in the same way a bird must watch a snake . They seemed to be coming right at him , and he could n't move . Their silhouettesswelled on the horizon , over the level earth . At what must have been the far end of the beach , perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barges . There was no anti-aircraft fire . The planes were too low , they had come too suddenly , hedgehopping , and any shrapnel from the anti-aircraft might have caught the men on the beach . The Messerschmitts roared along , all guns chattering , unopposed . McWilliams saw them coming almost at the same time as Tyne did . He turned to look at them almost casually , as though they were annoying flies . Then , when they started to fire their guns , he leaped up and ran for the hollow . He had gone perhaps twenty feet when the planes were upon him . Tyne could see the earth fly as their bullets cut a swath through it . McWilliams suddenlyfaced the planes and flung his arms in front of him as though the gesture could ward them off . Then he went back a few paces and collapsed with his arms still outflung . He too had been stitched . Right up the middle . After he had fallen Tyne cried out " McWilliams ! " His voice was lost in the roar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he screamed after them . " Son of a bitch . " He grabbed his rifle and fired three rapid shots after them . Foolish . The Messerschmitts went down the coast about three miles , went into an Immelmann , and came back along the beach . Tyne fired the rest of his magazineat them when they were still out of range and then threw himself down behind a tree . The machine-guns opened up again . He watched the planes , fascinated . One track of bullets cut the ground perhaps three feet from McWilliams 's body.  |p37As  the Messerschmitts passed to the north end of the beach one of them soared up , banked leisurely , and came back , this time behind Tyne . He scrambled around to watch it . The plane cut in very low over the woods where the platoon was hiding and opened up . Even from a distance of two hundred yards Tyne could see the tops of the trees quiver and shake as the bullets smashed into and through them . He felt completely lost . The Messerschmitt came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this time the machine-guns stopped almost as soon as they had begun . The plane had evidently run out of ammunition . It disappeared over some foothills to the northeast . For a moment after the planes had gone Tyne sat stupefied . The attack had shocked him . Planes always did . They were an impossible , unimaginable force . He could understand men against men , and even men against tanks , but planes were something else again . He had once read . a fantastic story about giganticinsects that turned against man ; the planes were those insects . Tanks , which could be taken for gigantic beetles , were terrifying too in their way , but one always knew that inside the tanks were men , and men were vulnerable . But the planes moved too fast . It was impossible to conceive of any human being , any human element , hidden in their bowels and controlling them . They had a life of their own , vindictive , murderous . Even his own planes made Tyne feel uncomfortable . For nearly three minutes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a tree . Over the ridge he could hear sounds from the beach . Men were shouting . Someone was screaming in a high-pitched voice . It sounded almost like a woman . Deliberately Tyne rose to his feet and walked out into the open where McWilliams was lying . As soon as he saw the body he knew that there was nothing to be done . There is something about a dead man 's face that can not be explained . Something has gone from the features . It is as though life lent an aura , a glow , that , unseen , could yet be perceived through some unknownsense . The face of a dead man resembles what the dead man is  --  a lump of clay . The face somehow merges with the earth.  |p38Clothes  hang awkwardly on the body and bunch up strangely ; the clothes seem foreign to the body that is wearing them . That was the way it was with McWilliams . Looking at his face , Tyne could not conceive that he had ever known him , that he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no need to touch the body to see if life still existed . McWilliams 's eyes were wide open . Blood seeped through the front of his . f atigues . One of the bullets had gone through his neck ; there was a lot of blood there . Tyne had seen much of death , but he had never reconciled himself to it . Death was indecent , obscene . There was something naked about a body , the nakedness of being unsouled , and there is no deeper nakedness than that . There was no time for Tyne to muse on the incontrovertible fact of death , even had he wanted to . He stared down at McWilliams'sbody for a moment and then looked hesitatingly at the ridge . It might be a good idea to take a quick look at the beach . The wounded man was still screaming . He heard a deep voice call " Bring it up , bring it up ! " Instead of mounting the ridge , however , he walked over to where McWilliams had dropped his rifle . Tyne laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no explanation for his action ; he just did it . Then he turned on his heel , walked back to the hollow , picked up the map case , and went out in the open field toward the wood . As he walked he lit a cigarette . He was a very much frightened young man . TRASKER WAS dead . Sergeant Hoskins had a bullet in the calf of his left leg , and Private Giorgio , of Sergeant Ward 's squad , had a smashed shoulder . The platoon had got off easily . The pilot of the Messerschmitt had seen something gleam in the woods . No one knew what it was , but the pilot must have seen something ; otherwise he would n't have taken the crack at them.  |p39If  he had n't run out of ammunition it might have been worse . As it was , the platoon never knew what hit them . They had not seen the plane come over . They had heard it machine-gunning the beaches , but when it went after the woods the trees had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smash down among them . They had been very lucky . Trasker had taken a slug in the mouth . He had been talking to Archimbeau  --  talking in a loud voice , because the planes were making a lot of noise  --  when they got him . He had started to say " For Christ 's sake , Arch  --  " but he had never got any farther . It was an odd thing to say as one 's last words , but that was just the way it was . Archimbeau felt very badly about it . When Trasker had fallen over he had reached out to grab him , and then he saw where the wound was , so he did n't bother . There was no point in it , once you saw the wound . They had n't even been able to shoot at the plane ; they had n't seen it . Hoskins knew it was a Messerschmitt that had put the hole in him , because Hoskins was an old soldier and he knew things like that . It was his business to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giorgio for instance , might never know who or what had shot them , because their minds did n't run in that direction . But Hoskins knew . He was n't in any real pain  --  not yet , anyway . The wound was n't such a bad one , but the muscles were torn and he could n't walk . He bandaged the wound himself . " Does it hurt ? " Porter asked . Porter was a little shaken by the strafing . He had not expected it , and it preyed upon his mind . I le believed that it was his fault , for it was he who had considered the wood a safe place ; he had brought the platoon there . " It do n't hurt yet , " Hoskins said , " but it god-damned well will . " " It 's a Purple Heart , Sarge , " Rivera said . " Shove it , " Sergeant Hoskins said . " Next Messerschmitt pilot I see I 'm going to shoot all by myself . Bastards . " " What are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for God 's sake , " said Hoskins . " What the hell did you think I was going to do ? Get up a god-damned football game ? " The wound had angered him and made him loquacious.  | " Giorgio got shot in the shoulder , " Porter said . " Who the hell cares ? " said Hoskins . Archimbeau sat looking at Trasker . Friedman came over and patted his shoulder . " He was a good guy , " Archimbeau said . " Okay , " said Friedman . " No Tibet , " Archimbeau said . " Okay . " " I wish Halverson would show up , " Sergeant Porter said . The platoon was spread out , sitting against trees . They felt beat up . Everything seemed to be going wrong . Nothing good had happened . It had been bad in the hollow and it was bad under the trees . The platoon wanted to move . The men were restless . They did n't care where they went ; they just wanted to be on the move . Each knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in a stagnant pool , and all around them flood waters were rushing toward an unknown and dangerous destination . One or two of them , for want of something better to do , were eating C rations . Everyone was keyed up . " We ca n't stay here all day , Eddie , " Sergeant Ward said . " I know it , for God 's sake , " Porter said . " But what can I do ? " Sergeant Ward thought a minute . " I do n't know , " he said . " How 's Giorgio ? " " He can walk . It 's not too bad . " " Hell of a thing . " Rivera was talking to Private Rankin , who was an automatic rifleman . " You want to live here ? " he said . " I did n't say I wanted to live here , " Rankin said . " It 's a nice country , " Rivera said . " Full of opportunity . Just look around you . Opportunity , that 's the big thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rankin said . " That 's a lousy way to talk about a country where you 're a guest . They 'll kick you the hell out . " " No they wo n't , " said Private Rankin . " Do you know who you 're fighting ? " Rivera asked  | " They never told me . Germans . " Rivera spat on the ground . " That 's all I want to know . " Rankin did n't understand him . " You 're screwy , " he said . " It 's life , " said Rivera . Archimbeau was walking around with his hands in his pockets , kicking dead leaves . His rifle was slung over his shoulder . " We were the same draft board , " he said . " The same day . " " Forget it , " Friedman said . He left Archimbeau and walked over to Rivera . " Go away , " Rivera said . " A butt . " Friedman gave him a cigarette . " Arch is taking it hard . " " Nobody dies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant Porter had just about made up his mind . There was nothing for it but to move on . It was the best thing to do . There was no sense in waiting for Halverson , because Halverson obviously was n't coming . He wondered what was keeping Tyne ; probably he was holing in , figuring that the planes would be back . Holing in , that is , if the planes had n't got him , too . There was a sound of someone coming through the bushes . Porter pointed his carbine in the direction of the sound . " Halt , " he said . The movement stopped . " Who 's there ? " " Tyne . " " Well , come on , for God 's sake . Where have you been ? " Tyne came into view . The platoon looked at him with interest . Some of the men came over to him . " What happened ? " Porter asked . Tyne was still smoking his cigarette . Before answering he took out another and lit it from the stub of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did the men around him . " Halverson 's dead , " he said . " God damn , " Porter said . " What happened ? " " Machine-gun got him . " " Plane ? " " No , the one that was down there . " " Bad , " Porter said.  | " McWilliams is dead , too . The plane got him . And the lieutenantdied . " Porter frowned . It was up to him now . " That does it , " he said . " Trasker 's dead here . Hoskins and Giorgio got wounded . " " I 've got the lieutenant 's map case . " " Get it from the barge ? " " No , I had it all the time . I was going to give it to you . " As Tyne handed him the case Porter stared at it as though he could not believe it existed . It was a shiny new map case ; Lieutenant Rand had never really had a chance to use it . The leather gleamed , but in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's in it ? " Porter asked . " I do n't know , " Tyne said . " Look and see . " Porter unbuckled it and looked inside . He pulled out two pieces of paper . One was a detail map of a limited area ; the other was a rough penciled sketch of what looked on first glance like a road junction . Slowly and deliberately Porter fell on his knees and spread out the large map . The whole platoon gathered around him then , those nearest the map falling on their knees , too , and those behind them looking over the first rank 's shoulders . The map was of the district where they were . There was the seacoast . There was the beach . There was the wood where they were . " There 's the road , " Porter said . He put his finger on it . Judging from the map , it was about a hundred yards to the south of the little wood . Halverson 's calculations had been slightly off . " Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road with his forefinger . " Here , " he said . " This must be it . It 's the only house . Let 's see , where 's the scale ? It 's about six miles , all right . " " Nearer seven , " Ward said . " What 's the other thing ? " The penciled sketch was spread out over the big map . " It 's the farmhouse , " Porter said . " What 's that ? " He pointed toward a series of concentric broken lines . " Rocks , " Tyne said . " High ground . "  | " It 's marked for a machine-gun , " Porter said . " One of the farm buildings is marked for a machine-gun , too . " " That 's me , " Rivera said . " I like to work indoors . " " There 's no god-damned orders , " Porter said . " Just this . " " Have to do , " said Ward . " He must have swallowed the orders , " Porter said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter , " Hoskins called . " Bring it over here and let me see it . " Porter picked up the two maps and carried them over to where Hoskins was sitting with his back against a tree . Hoskins took the map , and as he studied it he grimaced . His teeth showed black between his lips . " Giving you trouble ? " Porter asked . " It will , " Hoskins said . " That bridge . " " What about it ? " " You 'll have to blow it . " Porter frowned over the map . " Yes . Blow it , " he said . " You have to use grenades . They 'll bring up stuff over that bridge . " " Your leg hurting now ? " " Son of a bitch . God-damned Heinie bastards . Grenades will ( 10 it , all right . Take time , though . " Hoskins tossed the maps aside as though he were annoyed with them . " Leave me some water , " he said . " I may be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down to the beach ? " Porter was solicitous . He hated to lose Hoskins . " Like hell . They 'll be strafing that place for weeks . I 'm going to stay right here . " " What about Giorgio ? " " The hell with Giorgio . Jesus , Porter , you 're in command . Do n't ask so many christly questions . Leave me alone . " Porter picked up the maps and walked back to where the platoonwas gathered . He folded the maps and put them carefully hack in his case . " Cousins , go ask Giorgio if he can get back to the beach by himself , " he said.  |p44As  Cousins rose artillery fire came to their ears from the north . It was light stuff , coming from inland . As they listened they heard shells exploding near by . A machine-gun began far away ; another joined it . The battle was beginning . " We 've got to get moving , " Porter said . Another shell explodedquite near them . A few of the men ducked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rations before Tyne had returned , and now he was sucking on a lemon drop from the ration . " Giorgio says the hell with the beach , " he said . " He wants to go along . " " He ca n't go along , " Porter said . " They 'll be setting up a hospital here pretty soon . Tell him to stay here . " " Tell him yourself , " Cousins said . " You 've got the rank . " Porter stared fiercely at Cousins , opened his mouth to say something , and then walked over to Giorgio . " You 'd better go down to the beach , Giorgio , " he said . " Listen , " Giorgio said , " I 'm wounded . I got privileges . I do n't want to go down to the beach . I want to go along .

" " I 'll go back , " Tyne said . " Never mind , " Porter said . He walked over and picked up his carbine , which he had laid down while he was going over the maps . " Let 's go , " he said . " We 're going to move . " " For Christ 's sake , roll Trasker over , " Hoskins said . " I do n't want to have to look at that mug for two days . " Archimbeau rolled Trasker 's body over . His face was set as he did it.  | " Sunny Italy , " Rivera said . He picked up his barrel . " A little hike . " " You should have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition carrier . He did not like the job .

We 'll bust Hoskins 's squad up . Corporal Kramer , divide them in three . My squad will go first . Archimbeau and Cousins will be scouts . Rankin , follow them . Ward , you take the second squad after me . Tyne , you take the third . Kramer , you 're Tyne 's assistant squad leader . You bring up the rear . Get it ? " There were murmurs of assent .

I do n't think they 're wide awake yet , but they 're going to be . It 's a stinking situation . Right ? " " Right ! " chorused the platoon . " Then let 's go . " Archimbeau and Cousins started out , and Rankin followed them . While the file of men was moving out Tyne stood uneasily , watching them . A little , seedy man named Johnson slipped over to Hoskins and handed him a letter . " Mail this for me , will you , Sergeant ? " he said . Hoskins took it silently , and Johnson slipped into his place in Ward 's squad . Tyne went over to where Hoskins was lying . " How is it , Hosk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll keep , " he said .

" Tyne took his canteen from his belt . " Better hang on to this , " he said . " I forgot . Thanks , " said Hoskins . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to crack . " " How do you know ? " " I 've seen them crack , for Christ 's sake . He 's a good man , but I think he 's going to crack . That 's the way it goes . He 's got a lot on his mind . Keep your head on . " " Okay , Hosk . " The last of the three squads was moving out . Tyne took up his place at the rear . He was the last man in the platoon . " See you around , Hosk , " he said . " Yeah , " Sergeant Hoskins said . " Around . " The platoon wound through the wood , circling trees , stepping over bushes . Tyne caught one legging in a low thorn and very nearly tripped . He slashed at the thorn with his bayonet . Once he looked back , but he could no longer see Hoskins and Giorgio . They were out of sight behind the trees . When he thought of Giorgio he had to smile . He was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old country , yet all Giorgio would see of Italy was a beach and a little wood . It was ironic . Tyne , of all the people in the world , had never expected to be in Italy . He had never had the slightest urge to travel ; on the contrary , hep47was a one-town man . Rhode Island might be tiny and Providence might not be much as cities go , but it was all that Tyne wanted . If a war had not come along and pulled the pins from under the quiet life he had led and had wanted to lead , he might have been contented with an existence that contained , as its travel itinerary , three trips to New York City and one two weeks ' sojourn in the Great Smokies . Yet here he was , moving in toward the heart of an enemy country , a country that was a far cry from Rhode Islandand Providence , and all the rest of life . Tyne was caught up in a maelstrom , and , though he did not know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to cry out for help . They came out of the wood to a rough and dusty field . The sun had already dried the dew , and their feet kicked up small clouds of baked earth . The road cut through the dry field , running toward the northeast . It was little more than a cart track  --  two deep ruts running through the dull grass . They turned into it in two files , one walking on each side of the road . It was bad going . Carts had passed over the road in wet weather ; their wheels had sunk into mud , and the mud had dried , leaving deep welts . To their left the artillery pounded on . Shells were falling behind them and to the north , along the beach and among the ships . The machine-guns sang like locusts in a summer sun . They were all frightened . The barrage could not be trusted ; it was landing on the beach at the moment , but it might start moving inland at any time . They kept glancing anxiously behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move if they did n't watch it . The sun was beginning to bother Porter . He hated heat , and now , with the equipment he was carrying , sweat ran down his face and left pale rivers in the grime along his cheeks . He was still surprised that the sun could achieve so much heat so early in the morning . The six miles ahead of him became an infinity of miles . Before he had gone three hundred yards along the road he was tired . He shifted his carbine from shoulder to shoulder . From time to time he would glance behind him , not so much to watch the barrage as to check on the platoon . The road led up to a slight rise , and from this he could see the beach and the ships lying offshore . Barges were teeming around the transports . Obviously more men were coming ashore . That was the reason for the barrage . In that case , it would probably stay where it was . It would n't chase them . " It could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could have been the Engineers or the tanks . It could even have been the Navy . They looked at me and said , Here 's a guy that can walk . ' They finished me , all right . " " Everybody walks , " Friedman said . " Even monkeys . " " There are limits , " Rivera said . " Plenty of limits . " " I 've been thinking , " said Friedman . " How long have we been in the Army ? " " Jesus , " Rivera said . He spat into the dust . " Look at Hoskins . He gets a lousy little dig in the leg . He 's out of the Army . But he does n't want to be out of the Army . " " Justice , " Rivera said . " Where are we going , Rivera ? " " I am going some place where I can set up this weapon , " Rivera said . " And then I am going to shoot this weapon . I am not going to walk any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Why did n't they use paratroops ? Porter kept asking himself . The farmhouse , whatever its uses , was far enough inland to use the paratroops . It would have been the most natural thing in the world  --  just fly over , scatter a few , and let them hold it . God knows it would have saved time , lots of time . As things stood it was nearly ten . Valuable hours had been wasted , had been allowed to run down the drain . Time , that was so precious , had been spent recklessly . It was bad , bad all the way through . They would n't reach the farmhouse before noon . No worries crossed Tyne 's mind . For the first time that morning he felt fairly relaxed . As long as he was moving he was quite content . As he walked he looked about him at the country . The land was fairly level , but he figured that in about a half an hourp49they would run into rather rough-looking foothills . There was little vegetation . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a freak . A ditch , obscure and ill defined , ran parallel with the road , about fifty feet away . It looked like a trench . In a pinch it could serve for one . To a man marching in the sun time becomes as static as the shimmering horizon . It surrounds him and presses on his shoulders . He moves , but time stops . Seconds swell to giant size and minutes are immensities . The body conditions the mind 's knowledge of time  --  it flies in pleasure , it crawls in pain . And on no one does its weight fall more heavily than on the soldier . Yet as the platoon wound carefully along the dusty road time warred with itself . It crawled when the men thought of their march , it ran insanely when they thought of their objective . Over them hung the fear and the threat that something was going to happen , that Something was going to happen . They did not feel that they could move fast enough to beat time to the punch . In a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he can become numb . He can slog on , unaware of his surroundings , unaware of anything save the back of the man who slogs in front of him . But under fire , during a landing , during an advance , he must keep continuously on the alert . He must seek out rocks and trees and attempt to see through them . He must recognize that there is an enemy very near at hand and that even the landscape can rise up and kill him . " Suppose this road is mined , Sergeant , " Cousins said over his shoulder . " Do n't worry about it , " Porter said . " Okay , " said Cousins . " Not till after . " In the second squad Privates Carraway and James were discussingmusic . " That 's one thing I want to do when I get back , " Private Carrawaysaid . " I want a nice collection of records . " " I knew a guy must of had millions of records , " said Private James . " Millions , that guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all kinds of autographs . You could n't name anybody he did n't have an autograph . They even used to sign his records . He had a record of the Andrews Sisters with all three of their autographs . That 's the kind of life . " " Just the music is all I want , " Carraway said . " I got one collection , but I want a big one . I got all the Bing Crosby records except the last ones . " " You know Russ Columbo ? My sister used to be nuts about Russ Columbo . She stayed in her room all the time the day he died . " " Too bad . When 'd he die , anyway ? " " Hell , I do n't know . Must of been ten years ago . She was a kid . She 's married now . " " Her husband in the Army ? " " Beats me . I never heard from her . " " Maybe he 's in a war plant . " " That 's the life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag down . " " The hell with the dough . I 'd just like to be able to go home at night . " " If I had n't gone in the Army I was going to California . " " Have a job there ? " " Naw , I just always wanted to go to California . Out with the movie stars . " " There was an old Crosby picture in Tunis . I hope nothing happened to those records . " Archimbeau felt resentful , though he could n't quite tell why . As he walked he scuffed and kicked at dry clods of soil . He was carrying his rifle loosely in his right hand , carefully balanced betweenstock and barrel . As he advanced he kept turning his eyes from right to left and back again . He was angry at the terrain . It was all alike . Dry as dust . And when it was n't dry as dust it was wet , and when it was n't wet it was cold . But it all seemed to be the same country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum and held it with his hand while he tore away the paper with his teeth and pulled the long flat stick into his mouth . As hep51chewed it he thought of Trasker , and Trasker 's jaw . Nothing to it . He never knew what hit him . A good guy . What had happened in that ravine was his fault . He had tripped Trasker in the dark . Trasker never knew . Meant to tell him . Always meant to tell him . Allied planes were over the beaches , flying very high , back and forth . They would fly five miles toward the north , bank , and come back down again . Beneath them the shells were still explodingon the beach and in the water . They were dangerously near the platoon  --  really within ducking distance  --  but there was no time to be wasted dodging shells . There was no time to be wasted on anything . Ahead of the men , like an abyss , stretched the next two hours . But it was not a dark abyss , for the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was out of that bright sun that the Focke-Wulf came at them . THERE WAS so much noise that it was almost impossible to hear it . The planes to the south and the artillery fire and the occasional chatter of a machine-gun made hearing difficult . Archimbeau spotted the Focke-Wulf by instinct more than anything else . Ahead of him , in the sun , he caught an odd flash in the sky , a flash not of gold but silver . He did not even wait to ascertainexactly what it was . He threw up one hand , turned his head over his shoulder , yelled " Plane ! " and made for the ditch . Sergeant Porter blew his whistle , and the platoon broke for both sides of the road . Most of them made for the ditch . A few bolted for the open field on the other side of the road . As the men scattered the plane 's machine-guns opened up . Two men who were making for the field seemed to trip clumsily and went tumblingdown . The rest of the platoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Focke-Wulf all right , a dirty scum of a double-tailed Focke-Wulf . Tyne saw the pilot wave his hand to them as he flashed past . He continued on down the road , banked to the north , and went after the beach . He had come in very low , the way the three Messerschmitts had , over the foothills . It was only by the grace of God that Archimbeau had seen anything . It was pure luck . " Anybody hurt ? " Sergeant Porter yelled up and down the ditch . " Anybody hurt ? " " All right down here , " Tyne said . Porter came scrambling down to where Tyne was crouched . " Did you see that ? " he wanted to know . " Did you see that ? Right out of the blasted sun . The dirty bastard . " " There 's some wounded across the road , " Tyne said . " My squad , I think . I 'd better go over . " " Wait a minute . He may be back . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed out of the ditch and ran across the road . Five men were lying over there . " Who 's hurt ? " he said . One of the men was lying on his back . Tyne went over to him . It was Private Dugan , quite past hurting . " Smitty got one , " a man said . " Get the hell over in that ditch , " Tyne said . " Where 's he got it ? " " Arm and shoulder . " " Give me a hand with him . Get the hell into the ditch . " Tyne and Private Phelps picked up Private Smith . The other two men ran across the road and leaped into the ditch . One of them picked up Dugan 's rifle as he ran . " He 's out , " Phelps said . " Never mind . " They brought Smith across the road and loweredhim into the ditch . " Dugan 's dead , " Tyne said to Porter . " I know . " " Look at that Jerry , " Private Friedman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back along the beach . It was just a speck in the sky , far to the north . Above it , almost leisurely , three Allied planes swung out of formationand went into a steep dive . The Focke-Wulf pilot did n't seem to see them . He dipped his nose and came back down to/ward the south . The three Allied planes , whatever they were , hit him all at once . He saw them too late and tried to pull his ship up in a steep climb . They got him while he was starting it . The Focke-Wulf seemed to nose straight up , stopped , hovered a bit , and then fell back down again , going into a spin and explodingas it hit the water . The three planes went into a graceful climb , on their way back to join the formation . " Beautiful ! " Friedman yelled . " Beautiful , beautiful . " " No more waving for that baby , " Tyne said . " Did he wave ? " Porter asked . " I saw him . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . " Smith 's wounds were n't serious , but they would be painful . The sulfa was out and was going on , but Smith would be out of action for quite a while . " What the hell can we do with him ? " Porter asked . " Can we leave him here ? " Tyne looked up and down the road . " We 'll have to , " he said . " Ca n't take him with us . " " Nobody 'll find him . " A frown of concentration appeared on Tyne 's face . " The best thing we can do is wait till we get as far forward as we can , then send a man back . Things may be cleared up down here by then . The guy can bring back the stretcher-bearers . They can take care of Hoskins and Giorgio , too . " " Okay , " Porter said . " You pick a man . " " There 's no hurry . " " Think we 'd better get on with it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be more where that came from . " Tyne gestured down the road , where the FockeWulfhad gone into its last spin . " Better take a ten , anyway . " " Tell ' em , will you ? " Porter said . Tyne walked down the ditch . " Take ten , " he said over and over . " Can I smoke , Corporal ? " Rivera asked . " Burn , " Tyne said . " Butt me , Friedman , " said Rivera .   The dial on Tyne 's watch told him they had been moving for twenty minutes , more or less . That meant a mile , roughly  --  a mile away from the beach and a mile away from the shells . Five miles to go to the farmhouse . Tyne was beginning to get worried about tanks . The Germans , in the time they had had , could have brought tanks all the way from Rome and played a few games of red dog on the route . Perhaps the enemy tanks had already arrivedby another road and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There must have been more roads leading from the beach , and more important roads into the bargain . Otherwise they would never have sent a single platoonto hold one road , especially at such a great distance from the point of landing . The whole thing , Tyne decided , would make a nice problem to mull over in his old age  --  if , as , and when . Surely the road they were on could not be of much importance . They must be getting the tanks ashore by now , and if the road had any value the tanks would be trundling themselves along it . It was almost certain that the tanks were aiming northeast . The platoon 's job , in all probability , was to go to the farmhouse , blow the bridge , and thus make any counterattack impossible . That must be it , surely . During the break many of the men were getting at their rations . Tyne began to feel hungry again . He opened a tin of cold hash and ate it with relish . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man ate it day after day and meal after meal that the hash became unbearable . Then one was just as apt to throw it away as eat it . The hash was , of course , supposed to be eaten warm ; but whoever had put it up had neglected to include smokeless firewood , or firewood of any kind , or leisure . One ate rations only when one was in a hurry ; otherwise the thing to do was scrounge . In Sicily it had been watermelons and neat , small tomatoes . Here there was ( or seemed to be ) nothing . Only brown grass and dry mud . Nothing palatable at all . Rivera and Friedman , too , were eating hash , loudly and with the gusto of Socrates taking the hemlock .   " You know where they get this stuff ? " Friedman asked . " Yeah , " said Rivera . " I know where they get everything . " " Where do they get this stuff ? " " You know the sewers ? " " What sewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How do you know ? You got a brother works in the sewers ? " " Never mind my relations . You want me to tell you how they get it out of the sewers ? " " No . I 'm eating it , for Christ 's sake . " " We should be in the Heinie Army . " " They would n't take me , " said Friedman . " Why should we be in the Heinie Army ? " " The god-damned food . It 's good food . " " How the hell do you know ? You a spy or something ? " " How about the HQ we walked into in Sicily ? Wine on the table . Steak . A picture . " " It was Officers ' Mess . " " So what ? Do our Officers ' Mess get wine on the table ? Do they get steak ? The Heinies are really eating . " " They wo n't be . " Grimly . " Listen , chum , in three years the whole world will be eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Give it back to him . I ai n't interested . " " Do n't you think of nothing but your gut ? You 're fat , Friedman . You 're a chunk , Friedman . " " What the hell . First thing I 'm going to do when I get home is cat the god-damnedest biggest meal any guy ever ate . I would n't even tell you what I 'm going to have . You 're too insensitive . " " Butt me , Friedman . " " Listen , Rivera , all I been doing is feeding you fags . You think I bought out the American Tobacco Company or something ? " " Butt me . " " Ah , for Christ 's sake . " " What do you get out of it , Friedman ? " " Out of what ? "  | " The business . " " What business ? " " This business . " " I ai n't a member of the firm . " " You saw that Focke-Wulf . " " Yeah . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he called . " " How about a match , for God 's sake ? There 'll be another oneright along . Any minute now . " " I wo n't be in then , either . " " Friedman , you 're a draft dodger . You 're yellow , Friedman . " " That 's what I am , all right . Hold that match . " Sergeant Porter was crumbling a clod in his hand . He broke off a small piece of it , crumbled it in his palm , and then let the fine dirt sift through his calloused fingers . He counted the number of pieces he could break from each clod  --  good-sized pieces , about an inch through . From one clod he got seven ; from another nine . There were no more good-sized clods near him . He did not feel like getting up to find one . He felt , as a matter of fact , bored and listless . Events seemed to have moved past and beyond him . SergeantPorter was completely out of his depth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptiness that gripped him around the throat and made him afraid . It was hard to say just what was the matter with Sergeant Porter . Perhaps he had had too much war . Certainly he had had a lot of it  --  nearly a year . Scenes from Tunisia and Sicily kept flashing before his eyes . Men vary in the amount of war they can take . Some are good only for one action , others can stand it for years . But when a man gets enough of it , when he gets fed up , when he begins to tremble slightly and shift his eyes around or tremble slightly and stare eternally at one fixed spot , there is only one thing to do . Pull him out of the line and ship him back where the steak grows on trees and the only noise is that of the sunset gun . He may be some good there , but he 'll be through in the line . P57That was almost the way it was with Porter . He was a good man , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and he had gone through it with his head down and his eyes open . But he had reached what amounted to the end of his rope . He was n't beginning to tremble yet , but he was getting the shifty eye , the eye that does n't know what is waiting behind the tree or on the other side of the deserted house . Any soldier is expected to have an eye like that , but when they reach the end of the tether the thing that is waiting on the other side of the tree or the other side of the house has become inhuman . It is no longer an enemy  --  living , breathing , capable of death  --  but it is The Enemy . And Porter was beginning to get that feeling . It was growing on him day by day , it was keeping him awake at night . He was beginning to see things out of the corner of his eye . Sergeant Porter was , as a matter of fact , ready for the cleaners . He was a good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that remained was for the tether to break . " I 've got a hell of a headache , " Porter said to Tyne . The latter had come back from calling the break and was sitting beside his platoon commander . " A lousy headache . " " Tough , " Tyne said . " You trust this operation ? " " How do you mean ? " " You know . I do n't like the ring of it . It does n't ring true . There 's something funny about it . " Tyne told him what he thought of it : that to blow up the bridge at the farmhouse meant protecting the flank , that a fastmovingsmall body of men could get through quicker than anything else and accomplish the mission . " It sounds all right , " Porter admitted . It seemed to Tyne that Porter had shriveled somehow . He did n't look as burly as he once had ; he did n't even look as solid as he had early in the morning . " It 's the only thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added . " Everything 's been screwed up ever since we started , " said Porter . " First we lose the lieutenant , then McWilliams , then Hoskins , then we get machine-gunned . It 's all been bad . " " You 've got to expect the machine-guns , " Tyne said . He thought of McWilliams . There had been a lot like McWilliams . Smith was groaning a little , but he was smoking a cigarette at the same time , so it could n't be too bad . Smith was out of it for a while . The groans just meant that he was working for his Purple Heart . There were many men in the Army who would be glad to be in Smith 's shoes . " I do n't like the responsibility , " Porter said . " It 's not a sergeant'sjob . If I 'd wanted the responsibility I 'd have been an officer . " " You 're stuck with it , " Tyne said . He saw Porter 's point , however . It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . He was still worried about the tanks . " Tanks , " he said aloud . " Huh ? " " I hope to God they do n't send tanks along here before we get to that farmhouse . " " Jesus , you think they will ? " " You never know . " " We 'd better get moving , had n't we ? " " I think we had . If I were you I 'd keep off the road . Let 's take it along the ditch . It seems to follow the road pretty well ; as far as we can see , anyway . " Porter considered for a moment . " Okay . What about Smith ? " " I 'll talk to him . " With an effort Tyne rose to his feet and went over to where Smith was lying in the ditch , his pack underneath his head . " How you feeling , Smith ? " " In the pink , in the pink . " " Think you can stay here by yourself for a while ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be all right ? " A low groan . " Sure , Corporal ; just leave me some butts . " " Someone will be coming to pick you up . " Tyne took his packp59of cigarettes from his pocket and gave it to Smith . It was nearly full . " He 'll stay , " he said to Porter when he went back . " We 'd better get started , then , " Porter said . He blew his whistle . Grumbling , the platoon rose to its feet . Porter walked to the head of the column . " We 'll stick to the ditch this time , " he told them . " Keep the same formation , but stick to the ditch . " Casually the squads gathered together . Tyne took up his place as last man in the column . He listened to the sounds of battle to the north . They had increased perceptibly in volume . The battle sent its noises out in three sections . From far inland came the dull throb of enemy artillery , two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small arms , grenades , machinegunsand mortars , and from the sea came the thunder of the ships ' guns . Added to this and forming a blanket for it was the hum of aircraft circling endlessly over the beach . Tyne imagined that it was wooded country where the small-arms fire could be beard ; there must be a lot of sniping going on . That was the main engagement ; there could be no doubt about it . The platoon was completely out of that phase of the action . He was convinced that their job was to prevent any flank attack , and he wondered incuriously if Porter had accepted his theory . The way Porter was acting , it looked like he would accept a theory that said the road they were on led to Gettysburg , Pa . Tyne started to reach for a cigarette , then realized that he had given all he had to Smith . He walked over to where Smith was lying in the ditch . " Can I bum one of those butts back , Smitty ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then : " How long you think I 'll be here ? " " Beats me , " Tyne said . " It should n't be long , though . There 'll he plenty of company coming up this road pretty soon . " " What company ? " Tyne grinned . " Any kind you want . Take it easy , Smitty . " He walked away . " If I want anything I 'll ring , " Smith called after him . He had forgotten to groan .   Up front Porter blew his whistle . The platoon started to move . They could make time along the ditch just as well as on the road ; as a matter of fact , it was easier going , because it was level . There were no dry clods of mud and no ruts . They stepped out briskly . It could almost have been a route march . But every man 's ears strained toward the thundering hell to the north , and every man 's mind strained ahead of him . Tenseness was in every face . Uneasinesshad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation . Each spine was possessed of an unnatural rigidity ; they were all stiff and uneasy . They had begun to fear the road that ran along by the ditch . It had taken on proportions beyond any intentions of those who had once driven their carts and wagons over it . The road ran , a skinny , unsatisfactory ribbon , toward the crouching Unknown , the dangerous future . Over it at any time might appear a motorcyclist or an armored car or a tank . The next five miles were full of terrors . Before them stretched a series of little hills , wooded in patches . They were getting away from the level ground that merged with the beaches . Somewhere in this district was a great plain , but they did not seem to be anywhere near it . Nowhere could they see any signs of life  --  either houses or fields or men . Only the ditch and the crude road proved that this was inhabited country . If it had not been for the sounds of battle a great and utter silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P-38 's crossed the road , flying low , heading for the firing . Strafe job , Porter thought as he watched them pass and vanish over low hills . He wished that three of them would roar up the road ahead of the platoon and see what was going on . But then , he decided , if anything was happening up there one of the planes would have noticed it . He felt slightly comforted by the number of Allied planes over the beach . It was obvious that they had air superiority , and that meant a lot . It could mean everything . It might even save them , though Porter could not say , even to himself , what it would save them from . All he had was a half-formed idea that they were walking into trouble . He did not know why he felt that way ; all that he knew was that he did . P61It was an emotion that could not be called fear , because Porter was not afraid , not in the strict sense of the word . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in its way can be more paralyzing than fear . Porter had at last reached the stage where he hated to do anything . He could no longer bring himself to move of his own accord ; he had to have someone else urge him on . He was not , however , completely passive . On the contrary , he preferred to force the issue by asking the other man leading questions . What did he think should be done ? Should such and such a thing be done in such and such a way ? He could no longer put his brain to work ; he had to have a middleman between his body and his mind . The gunfire made Porter nervous . Irresistibly he found himselfdrawn to it . Gunfire was understandable , dire though it might be . It was identified with men and actual happenings ; there was nothing secret about it . You could hear the shell coming , you could see the sniper in the tree , you could lie under the machine-gun 's swath . But moving toward an unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not dead . Perhaps , he thought , he was n't dead at all . There was no confirmation . McWilliams could n't have seen him . On a sudden impulse Porter dropped out of the column and waited until Tyne came abreast of him . " What 's the matter , Eddie ? " Tyne asked . " About Halverson , " Porter said . " Did McWilliams see them bring him in ? " Tyne thought a moment . " No , " he said slowly . " He said Tollivertold him . " " Who 's Tolliver ? " " He 's a guy in B Company . " " Never heard of him . " " He must have been a friend of McWilliams . " " Did he know Halverson ? " " He must have . He said he saw Halverson . "   " And he said Halverson was dead ? " " That 's what Mac said . " They walked on in silence for a minute . " Bill , " Porter said , " suppose Halverson is n't dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose there was somebody who looked like him . " " Suppose there was . " " I do n't think Halverson 's dead , Bill . What do you think ? " " God damn it , I do n't know . All I know is what Mac told me . " " I do n't think he 's dead , Bill . " " I hope he is n't . I do n't wish any hard luck to anybody . " " Sure as hell , he 's going to show up here . I 'll bet you anything he 's trying to catch up with us now . They ca n't knock off a competentbastard like Halverson . Guys like that come through every time . " Tyne studied Porter 's face . " Do you want to stop and wait ? " he asked . There was a suspicion of sarcasm in his voice . " No , that would n't do any good , " Porter said seriously . " I wish to hell he was here , though . " " Give me a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke as he watched Porter jog heavily back to the head of the little column . Archimbeau was plotting the course of the war as he strode along . He was trying to improve on the fact that he expected to fight the Battle of Tibet eventually , and he was trying to remembergeography that had slipped his mind in the eighth grade . There was , he was sure , a country east of Tibet , but he was goddamnedif he could think of it . All he could think of was Afghanistan , and as he remembered it that was somewhere around India . Victor McLaglen in the movies was always fighting around there . He had the itinerary down pretty well up to Tibet , though . Archimbeau , who did not , in all seriousness , expect to see the shores of the United States for three years , wondered where he would have gone if he had been sent to a place like New Guinea . Probably to some of those islands and then to Burma or somep63place . He wished he had an atlas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , Cousins , " he said . " What comes after Tibet ? " " What comes where after Tibet , for God 's sake ? " " In the war . Where we going to fight the war after Tibet ? " " How the hell do I know ? In bed . " " There 's a country . I ca n't think of its name . " " There 's a million countries I ca n't think of their names . " " All right , I just asked . Forget it . " But Cousins had suddenly lost interest in Archimbeau . Over on the left , about five hundred yards away , he saw two figures corning toward them . " Arch , " he said softly . " Look . " Archimbeau looked . And as he saw the figures Cousins turned and went running back to Sergeant Porter . He crouched a little as he ran . WHAT THE hell are they ? " Sergeant Porter asked . " Damned if I know , " Cousins said . " Too far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a couple of men and go down and see . " Johnson , Riddle , " Ward said . The three of them cut away from the ditch , crossed the road , and moved over the field . " Take it easy , " Porter said after them . Sergeant Ward had a grenade in his hand and his carbine crooked under his left arm . The figures had disappeared in a little gulley . " Fan out a little , " Ward said . Johnson and Riddle fanned out as Ward broke into a trot . They picked up the pace from him . Suddenly Ward flung himself down on the ground ; the privates followed him . Two hundred yards away the figures appeared again . They were men , walking fast . Every ten seconds one of the men would look behind him as though he feared pursuit . They were Italian soldiers , evidently unarmed . Ward rose to his feet and whistled at them . They looked in his direction and stopped dead in their tracks . One of them started to run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped uncertainly . Then he came back . Ward made a gesture for them to come to him . They hesitated for a moment and then , without a word passing between them , they simultaneously broke into a run . Ward , as they came up to him , looked them over calmly . They looked dead beat . Both had three days ' worth of beard and their uniforms were torn and dirty . One man had torn the leg of his pants , and through the hole Ward could see a blood-soaked bandage . When they came within ten feet they stopped running , smiled , and burst out into loud exclamations , one man 's words running into the other 's . One of them was just a kid , not more than nineteen ; the other , with the injured leg , was about thirty . " You speak English ? " Ward asked the older man . They both shook their heads violently in the affirmative and went on talking Italian . " Oh , hell , " Ward said . He gestured for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnson and Riddle fell in silently behind the Italians . " Couple of wops , " Ward said to Porter as he came up to the ditch . " Yeah , " Porter said . " They speak English ? " " Damned if I know . " " We 'll find out , " Porter said . " Hey , Giorgio ! " " Giorgio got wounded , " Archimbeau said . " What 's the matter with me ? " Porter said . " Yeah . Tranella ! " Tranella , a dark little man from Ward 's squad , came over . " You want me , Sarge ? " he asked . " Can you talk Italian ? " " Sure I can talk Italian . " " Talk to these guys . "  | " What 'll I say ? " " Ask them where they come from , for Christ 's sake . " The two Italians were standing awkwardly , still grinning at nothing . Tranella looked calmly at them . " Where are you from ? " he asked in Italian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder came over to Tranella and clasped him around the shoulders . " Un cornpatriotto ! " he said . " All right , " Tranella said . " Where are you from ? " " Turin , " the man said eagerly . " He says he 's from Turin , " Tranella said to Sergeant Porter . " Where 's that , for God 's sake ? " " Up north . ' Way up north . " " I do n't mean that . Find out where he 's coming from now . " " Oh . Where are you coming from ? " The Italian waved his hands toward the north . " There is a battle up there , " he said . " We are running away from the battle . Before that we were running away from the Germans . We are no longer fighting . " Tranella translated . " Ask him what 's going on up there . " " What did you see of the battle ? " " Ah , we saw much of the battle . We were lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We heard the firing . " " What tanks ? " " The German tanks . " " He says they were lying along a road and they saw the Germansbringing up some tanks . " " Did the tanks go back again ? " " No , they did not go back again . " " One went off in a field , " the younger man said . " Yes , " said the older man , " one went off in a field . It was one of the big ones , the Tigers . " " In which direction did the Tiger go ? " " Toward the sea , " the older Italian said . " Going toward the beach , Sergeant . "  |p66Porter  looked back , along the road they had come . " When was this ? " " When was this ? " Tranella translated . " One hour ago , " the man said . " Two hours ago . I have no watch . Neither of us has a watch . " " He does n't know for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ask him if he saw any Germans . " " Did you see any tedeschi ? " " I saw only the tanks . But there are many roads up there . There are many roads the tedeschi could use . " " Only the tanks , Sergeant . " " God damn it , Tranella , see what you can find out . Ask him some questions . " " I am , Sergeant . " " Well , find out something . " " Ask him if he knows this country , " Tyne said . " The corporal wants to know if you know this country . " The older Italian smiled at Tyne . " I am from the north , but I know this country . I was once stationed here . I have maneuveredin this area . " " He says yes . " " Good , " Tyne said . " Where 's the map , Eddie ? " " What map ? Oh . It 's here . " Porter passed him the map case . " We have here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map of the area . Tell him that , Tranella . " Tranella told him . The Italian nodded vigorously . " I too am a corporal , " he said . " I have handled maps . " Tyne spread the map out on the brown grass , where it developedpointed little hills of its own at the folds . " We are here , I think , " he said , putting a dirty finger at a point along the road . " Ask him if I am right ? " " Are we where the corporal has put his finger ? " The older Italian fell on his knees beside Tyne and the younger one crowded over his shoulder . " Yes , " he said , " we are there . Perhaps a little farther on . There is where the battle is . " Hep67pointed to a road junction at the far left of the map . " And here is where we saw the tanks . " " Is it bad country ? " Porter asked . " The sergeant wants to know if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for defence . We have defended it up thereiii the maneuvers . It is rough . There are many ravines . The rainmakes them . This road will take you to country like it . " " It is very dusty , " the young man said . " Have the Germans many men there ? " Tranella wanted to know . " Who knows ? " said the older Italian . " Who knows about the tedeschi ? They have beaten us . Everyone has beaten us . We are no longer soldiers . " " He says he do n't know how many Germans are around , " Tranella said . " There were many tedeschi in this place , " the Italian said , pointing to a town . " But that was five months ago . Who knows now ? " " The Germans are everywhere , " the younger man said . " I myselfhave killed un tedesco . " " This young guy says he 's knocked off a Kraut , " Tranella said . " Ask him where , " said Porter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed him in Capua . I hit him with a rock . " " We have left the Army , " the older Italian said . " We are going south . He has relatives down there . " " An uncle , " the young man said . " We have to hide sometimes , " the older said . " I think the Germans would kill us if they found us . I did not want this war . " " Nor I , " the young man said . " Things are different in the north , " said the older . " My people are from Milan , " Tranella said . " They have told Inc about it there . " " Then you know what things are like there , " said the Italian . " We are working people . We did not want war . We did not want the Germans . They give you no choice . Now we can not go home . The Germans cover the north like beetles . " " They wo n't , " Tranella said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . They are very difficult . " " He 's griping about the Germans , " Tranella said . " For God 's sake , " said Porter , " do you think we 've got nothing to do but sit around while he tells us what 's the matter with Italy ? We know what 's the matter with Italy . Find the hell out about that farmhouse . " " This farmhouse here , " Tyne said . " Ask him if he knows anything about it . " Tranella pointed to the house on the map . " Do you know anything about this farm ? " The Italian studied the map carefully . " I do n't know , " he said . " It is hard to say . This is not one of our maps . Yes , I remember that place . I remember that bridge . That is a nice farm . " " Ask him what kind of bridge it is . " " What kind of bridge is it ? " The Italian looked puzzled . " That I do not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be concrete . There are so many bridges . " " He do n't know , " Tranella said . " Ask him does he know where I can get a pizza , " Rivera said . " Shut up , " said Sergeant Porter . " I can tell you one thing , " the Italian said . " Inland there are many tedeschi . " " He says there 're a lot of Krauts a few miles along , " Tranella said . " How many ? " " Who can tell ? Everywhere there are many . " " He says he has n't got any god-damned idea . " " I would like a cigarette , " the older Italian said . " I , too , " said the younger . " Now they both want butts , " Tranella said . " Give them a couple , " Porter said.  | " Out of my own , for God 's sake ? " Tranella said . " Give them a couple , " Tyne said . Tranella gave each of the Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply and luxuriously . " Good , " said the younger . " Good tobacco . " " The best , " said the older . " Well , " he said to Tranella , " now we are your prisoners . We shall follow you . " " He says they 're our prisoners and that they 're going to come along , " Tranella said . " The hell they are , " Porter said . " We are n't at war with Italy any more . They can go where they god-damn please . " " You can go , " Tranella said . The older man gave a gesture of surprise . " But where can we go ? " he asked . " We have no money . The Germans will get us . " " They 're your friends , " Tranella said . " We are hungry , too , " said the older Italian . " Now the bastards say they 're hungry , " Tranella said . " Give them some K ration , " Porter said . " They can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of K ration to the older Italian . " When they get a mouthful of that crap they 'll wish Italy never went out of the war . They 'll think twice about the Americans next time . " " Tell them they will be safe here , " Porter said . " The sergeant says that you will be safe here , " Tranella said . " No Germans will come here . " " We would rather go with you , " the older Italian said . " It is an order , " said Tranella . Then , to Porter : " Goddamnedestpeople I ever saw . " " We might as well go on , " Porter said to Tyne . ' Fyne carefully folded the map and put it back in the case " We might as well , " he said . " Thanks , Tranella , " Porter said . " Any time , Sarge . " Tranella wandered back toward the rear f the little column . The Italians remained standing where they were , confused and uneasy .   " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyne said . " Not a damned bit more . " " Did you expect to ? " Porter wanted to know . " They might have known something . " " They never know anything . I 've seen too many of them come in . They know all about the private lives of their god-damned lieutenants , but they do n't know anything else . They never know anything else . You always draw a blank . " Porter blew his whistle and the column started off again . " Stay up here with me , Bill , " he said . " I want to talk to you . " The Italians stood watching the platoon pass them . They were still watching as the last men disappeared over the crest of a small hill . The older one still had the can of K ration clutched in one hand . " That 's the Italians for you , " Rivera said . " What 's the Italians ? " Friedman wanted to know . " All give and no take . " " What nationality are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What did you think I was ? " " I was just wondering , that 's all . " " So help me God , I hope I never see another Italian after this war . I never want to see another one .

" " You 're a tough baby , Rivera . " " I sure as hell am . " " What are you going to do after the war ? " " Join a mob . I 'm a mobster . " " What did you do before the war ?

I 'm going to get out of this Army . " " Me , too , " Friedman said . " Move over . " In the second squad Privates James and Carraway were discussingArt . " The Saturday Evening Post has the best covers , " James said.  | " That guy . What 's his name ? Norman Rockwell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some covers about the Army .

That 's how long I been in the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were issuing muzzle-loading rifles . That 's how long I been in the Army . "  |p73Sergeant  Porter and Corporal Tyne slogged along in silence . Porter kept his head down , as though he were studying the ground before his feet . Tyne kept his eyes straight ahead , watching the backs of the scouts , Cousins and Archimbeau . Occasionallyhe looked sidewise at Porter . The thought of the two Italians kept running through his head . He knew very little about Italy , but when he considered it he imagined that he probably knew as much about it as he did any other country , excepting his own . Italy , England , France , and Germany  --  those were the countries Americans knew best . Tyne did not hate Italy , nor did he hate the Italians . He merely ignored them . Some of the men , he knew , hated them  --  not necessarily because they had killed their share of Americans , but because they were cowards . They ran . They always ran . A soldier could hate the Germans , but he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stubborn bravery and their cunning and their battle wisdom . But the Italians had none of these negative virtues . The Italians had nothing . The two ex-soldiers had , in a way , been pitiful . They had been cast out on a world that they could no longer comprehend . And yet it had been a world they had helped to make , a world they had probably wanted to make , a world of confusion in which they and millions like them would have been the only elements possessed of power and will , or at least possessed of leaders who were possessed of power and will . But now the leaders were gone and the power and the will with them . What remained was chaos and ashes , a country shattered and a people lost . " Bill , " Sergeant Porter said , " did you ever have the feeling that something was going to happen to you ? " " I have it all the time . " " I 've got it now . " " Do n't worry about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like it . Something 's happened to me . " " What ? " " I do n't know . Look : if you have to , will you take over ? "   " What about Ward ? " " I want you . " " Sure , Eddie . But do n't worry so damned much . Everything 's going to be all right . " " Everything 's always all right , " Porter said . He went back to staring at the ground . He was beginning to frighten Tyne a little . Something was evidently the matter with Porter . It was as though he were in a vacuum , as though someone had put him in some great bottle and then had drawn out all the air . Porter was lifeless , limp . He seemed unable to form an opinion any more . Tyne rapidly ran through the places where he had seen Porter in action , where he had been most intimate with him . The places framed themselves like signposts in his mind  --  Tebessa , Gafsa , Bizerte , Gela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a definite change in the man , a definite and dangerous change . " Ward might not like anything like that , " he said . He was trying to draw Porter out . " Why should n't Ward like it ? " Porter demanded . He did not raise his eyes from the ground . " There 's no reason why he should n't like it . He has his job . " " We all have our jobs , " Tyne said . Said Sergeant Porter , " I do n't feel well . I feel god-damned lousy . My head aches . " The ditch stopped abruptly , for no apparent reason . They were coming into lightly wooded country , of rather sharper slopes . Here and there a great boulder could be seen . The trees looked ancient and gnarled . None of them were very large ; it was as though they could not draw enough sustenance from the soil and were sentenced to be forever stunted . There was an air of strain about the trees , as though they were striving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible and unreasonable conditions . When the ditch stopped , Archimbeau swerved over to the road without awaiting any command . The rest of the column trailed after him . As far as Archimbeau was concerned theyp75might just as well walk on the road as anywhere else . It made no difference to him . It was all the same country , all the same war . The same dangers were everywhere . He did not expect any more planes to come over . Allied planes were covering the territorypretty well ; they were passing over the column frequently now , and if anything went wrong , either on the road ahead or around them , the planes would spot it . As far as Archimbeau was concerned the operation had developed into an automatic business . All they had to do was get to where they were going , do what they had to do , and then relax . It was simple ; it was as simple as anything ever was . It was as simple as the Battle of Tibet would be . That was always the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stilled voice , the smashed jaw , the bereft body . Death was like that . " Cousins , " he said , " you married ? " " Naw , " Cousins said . " Why the hell should I be married ? " " After the war I 'm going to get married . " " Okay . Go ahead . " " Honest to God , if I had a wife now she 'd be sending me things . Cookies , maybe . Maybe a sweater . I have n't got a package since I come overseas . " " I have n't got a package either , " Cousins said . " What the hell good is it anyway ? You open it and you got to give something to everybody you know . There 's no percentage in that . I 'm just as happy . If I was married I 'd have to be sending money home all the time , too . And God knows what my wife might be doing . The hell with it . " " When I get to Tibet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry a Tibet woman . " " Okay , " Cousins said . " Go ahead . " Time stopped in the sound of the moving feet . The clocks ran out . The sun stood still . The world contracted . To the north the battle , the battle that had not yet touched them , went on . They were a part of it and yet not a part of it . For the moment they were still individuals , because their group was small enough for them to be individuals . They had not yet become part of a huge and heaving mass . Each man was recognizable as himself . The platoon was part of a larger pattern , but it had not yet lost its identity . The battle whose noises rolled over the little hills at them was still standing and watching them go about their essential business ; it had not yet beckoned them to come . They had been in an enemy country for five hours , and they had not yet seen an enemy . THEY COULD hear the motorcycle coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs they turned to look at it . None of them considered the possibility that it might be an enemy motorcycle ; it was coming from the direction in which they had come , and it had to be one of theirs . It came slowly for a motorcycle . The rider was obviously having trouble with the rutty road . He jazzed his motor , modulated it , and then jazzed it again . Over the sound of the motorcycle they could hear Porter 's whistle demandingthat they halt . They halted , raggedly . The rider bounced up to the head of the column and stopped by Sergeant Porter . He cut his motor . He was a sergeant , too . " What 's cooking , Jack ? " he said to Porter . " All quiet so far , " Porter said . " Where you from ? " The rider ignored the question . " What 's up this road ? " he wanted to know . " Damned if I know , " Porter said . " Where you from ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The 25th what , for God 's sake ? " " Infantry . " " Never heard of them . " The rider looked puzzled . " They were supposed to be up this road , " he said.  | " Anything can be up this road , " Porter said . " There are some other roads running from the beach , " said Tyne . " They run right through the battle area , according to the map . " " Jesus , " the rider said , " I did n't know there were any other roads . They just told me to go up the road . They did n't say anything about more than one . What the hell , that 's the Army . " He lit a cigarette . " What 's it like on the beach ? " Porter asked . " Okay , " the rider said . " A little rough . They 're shelling the god-damned place . Was that your man I saw down the road ? " " What man ? " Porter asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , he 's ours . He all right ? " " Damned if I know . I just saw him sitting in a ditch . He did n't complain . " " Did you see a couple of Italian soldiers ? " Porter asked . " Christ 's sake , they still fighting ? " the rider asked . " No , we just ran into them down the road . " " Did n't see them . What 're you looking for up here , anyway ? " " Objective 's a farmhouse , " Porter said . " About three miles up the road . " " Anything up there ? " the rider asked . " Damned if I know . " " Want me to take a run up and see ? " " I thought you were looking for the 25th , " Tyne said . " They 'll keep , " said the rider . " It 's not important . Nothing 's important in this god-damned war . " " It 'll be damned nice if you 'll scout a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my mind , anyway . " " Okay , " the rider said . He flipped away his cigarette . " Thisis the first time I 've been to Italy . I got to see the country . " He shoved his machine in gear and roared away up the road , vanishing over the brow of a hill . The platoon resumed its march . " I feel better , " Porter said . " Maybe I should have told him it was the farmhouse by the bridge . You think I should have told him that , Bill ? " " It 's the only farmhouse there is , " Tyne said . " He ca n't miss it . " " You can always miss , " Porter said . " But I feel better . If the road 's clear it might be all right after all . How long do you think it will take him to get back ? " Tyne considered . " Fifteen or twenty minutes , " he said . " That 's the kind of a job to have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice shiny carbine . No walking . Solid comfort . " " Between you and me , Jakie , " said Rivera , " motorcycles scare hell out of me . " " I did n't think you were scared of anything . " " Women and motorcycles , Jakie . A butt . " Wearily Friedman passed him a cigarette and a match . " When I run out of butts , " he said , " you 'll be in a hell of a mess . " " I 'll find a new friend , " Rivera said . " I 'd still like to be sitting in his boots , " said Friedman . " Whose boots ? " " The guy on the motorcycle . It 's a life . " " What are you , Friedman , a lousy hero ? " " I like my comfort . " " Those guys are dead pigeons . High mortality rate . " " So what ? " " That was the first sergeant I ever saw on a motorcycle . Most of them are lucky if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'll ever live to make corporal ? " " Baby , I just want to live long enough to make civilian . " " You 've got no imagination , Rivera . You 're a lump . " " Okay . " Sergeant Ward was thinking of apples . He did n't know why ; he just happened to be thinking of apples . They made a wonderfulpicture in his mind  --  huge , red , and juicy . He thought of the different varieties , Baldwins , McIntosh Reds , pippins , russets . Hep79imagined he was cutting one with a knife , the creamy flesh showingwet as he opened the halves . And the funny thing about it was that Ward did n't like apples very much . Occasionally he would cat one , but he was n't one who went overboard for them . He 'd take a pear any day . But right now it was apples . Pears were yellow and the country was yellow ; the combination was bad . But apples were red and wet and cold and juicy . Sergeant Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damp cloth clung to his back . It had seemed hardly warm enough last night , and now it was killing him . Stupid . Apples . There were more trees , and from the crests of the little hills gaunt , rain-formed gullies cut down to the hollows . Incipient serious erosion was everywhere . With his practised farmer 's eye Sergeant Ward studied the soil . He did not like it . It looked old and tired and worn out . Soil was like a body . If you did n't take care of it it would die . There was too much dead soil in the world . For nearly a year Sergeant Ward had been studying the earth . Most of what he had seen had been bad . There were some rich places in Tunisia . They took care of it there ; they had taken care of it for centuries . Those were the people who really grew things , who wanted to grow things , who made things live for them . The soil in this small part of Italy was dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . They had been walking on it for many , many years . Sergeant Ward was a farmer , and he was also a man of strong opinions that , once formed , were changed only by an Act of God or his wife . He had nearly formed the opinion that Italy was a barren country . He could do it on just what he had seen since he had landed- And though he might spend the rest of his sojourn in Italy walking around in lush gardens and vineyards , he would never change his opinion . He would take it back to Vermont with him . He would spread it wherever he went . Sergeant Ward was not one to take the long view . " It 's time that rider was coming back , " Porter said . Tyne looked at his watch . " He 's only been gone ten minutes . "   " It seems longer . " " Take it easy , Eddie . It 's a long war . " " I know . But everything takes so damned long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're doing all right , Eddie . " He was not , of course , sure that they were doing all right . He was n't sure of anything of the kind . On the contrary , he was worried about the whole business . Not in the way Porter was , though . Porter was more than worried : he was rattled . But Tyne had the natural worries of a careful man . He knew that it was possible for things to go smoothly , but the wisest thing was to take it for granted that they would n't . You could n't go wrong that way . Then , if they turned out to be smooth after all , you felt so much the better . It was not the best philosophy in the world , but it worked . " It 's taking him a long time , " Porter said . " Take it easy , Eddie , " Tyne said again . " It 's always the same , " Porter said . " Nothing ever happens right . It 's always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wait for someone and he never shows up . You tell somebody to do something and he does it wrong . It 's never going to be any different . Never . They put me on to this job , and I did n't want it . It is n't my responsibility . I do n't understand this war . Everything 's crazy . Nothing 's gone right today . It 's not going to get any better . " He spoke in a flat , taut monotone that did not carry beyond Tyne 's ears . " You 're worrying too much , Eddie , " Tyne said soothingly . " There 's nothing to worry about . It 'll go along . It was worse in other places . " " In other places we knew where we were going , " Porter said . " Sometimes we did n't . " " We thought we did . " " This is a tough road . That rider ca n't make any time . " " They can always make time if they want to make time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? "  | " If they catch us on this road they 've got us cold . Like mackerel . " The same idea had passed through Tyne 's mind and had worriedhim . It was perfectly true ; they 'd be duck soup for tanks . Even one tank , for that matter . It could come up over one of the hills and be on them before they 'd have time to scatter . And all they had was grenades and damned little cover . Tyne did n't relish the thought of the tanks . " There probably is n't a tank within five miles of here , " he said . " They 're all over where the noise i , % " Porter stared at the ground . He did not answer . " I wrote a letter to my wife , " Private Johnson said to Private Riddle . " All right , " Riddle said . " I wrote it in the landing barge . Hard as hell to write somethingwhen you ca n't see it . " " Why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Johnson said . " A man does n't want to take no chances . I even wrote the envelope in the dark . It looked good . " " How the hell do you know it looked good ? " " I saw it in the daylight . Then I give it to Sergeant Hoskins . " " What for , for Jesus ' sake ? " " To mail for me . " " That old bastard 'll probably tear it open and read it . He 's probably reading it right now , " Riddle said . " Aw , he would n't do a thing like that . " " You never know what a sergeant will do . They do some goddamnedfunny things . " " He would n't do that . " " How do you know he would n't ? Maybe he thinks there 's money in it . Maybe he 's using it for a bandage . He 's got a bullet hole in him . Maybe he stuffed it in the bullet hole . " " You 're crazy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you know you ca n't ? "  | " It crinkles . " " Jesus , what a dope . The next time you get a bullet hole in you , stuff some paper in it and see how it feels . Then you 'll know . " " I never had a bullet hole in me . " " Wait 'll you get one , then . " " Cut that stuff out , Riddle , " Sergeant Ward said . " If he mailed a letter , he mailed a letter . Leave him alone . " " I was just kidding , Sarge , " Riddle said . " You got a mean streak , Riddle . Somebody 's going to paste you one of these days . " " I 'll wait , " said Riddle . " Okay , Johnson , you mailed your letter . " Then , in a whisper : " But you never know what sergeants will do . " " They wo n't do anything , " Johnson said . The battle seemed to be increasing . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded deeper and more dangerous . The platoon was now far from the danger area . It was as though the country had taken the men in and hidden them . They were surrounded by a near silence , over which the noise of the battle seemed faint , foreign , and far away , as though it were coming to them over water , as though it were not their quarrel . It was the road that might betray them to the war . It was the one way out of the silence , their one link with the outside world . Over it the rider had gone , vanishing from what they knew into what they did not know . Impatiently they waited for his return . They did not talk to each other about it ; rather the feeling was understood . The most important thoughts never have to be spoken . The rider was late . He was overdue . They strained to catch the sound of his motor , roaring toward them out of the unknown country before them . Over their heads the trees reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trees were larger now , and of a different variety . Their branches were clean and lithe , but their trunks were warped and gnarled , as though theyP83had had hard births . The whole country looked as though it had fought to come alive ; either that or had lived too long . They all thought that , though none of them could have put it into words . With an instinct like that of animals , they could be satisfiedor dissatisfied with a landscape on sight . They could see the whole thing as one great panorama , with everything in its place , without knowing what it was about the view that they disliked . " I suppose you still think he 'll be back , " Porter said . " He may have gone further on than we thought he would , " Tyne said . " Or he might have got a flat . " " He did n't go too far and he did n't get a flat , " Porter said . " He ran into trouble . Did you hear any firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He ran into trouble . " Exasperation surged up in Tyne . " For Christ 's sake , Eddie , " he said , " I do n't know what 's the matter with you or what you 're thinking , but you 're going to have everyone with their tongues hanging out if you do n't snap out of it . What the hell 's the mat-ter ? " " I do n't know . " Porter brushed his hand across his forehead under the helmet . " My head aches . " " Are you sick ? " " I do n't know . Leave me alone . " " Okay . " " Still want to be on a motorcycle , Ugly ? " Rivera asked . " Sure , " Friedman said . " It 's a life . " " In that guy 's case , the question is  --  is it a life ? " " He 's probably sitting under a tree somewhere , reading a book . " " Friedman , it 's optimists like you that cause all the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " How the hell do I know where he 'd get a book ? " Friedman took out a package of cigarettes , removed one , crumpled the package , and threw it away . " I 'll let you watch me , " he said . " Open another god-damned pack , " Rivera said .   " All I got , baby . " " A drag , then . " " I 'll consider it . " " What 's the point of having a motorcycle if they knock you off every time you get on to it ? And if they do n't knock you off you smack into a wall in the dark and knock yourself off . What 's the point ? Where 's the percentage ? " " It 's all in how you look at it , " Friedman said . " A motorcycle is a civilized way to travel . " " We ai n't in civilization , " Rivera said . " We ai n't anywhere . A drag . " Sighing , Friedman passed over his last cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it easy , " Friedman said . " Take it easy . " " I 'm a hard man , " said Rivera . Time moved on to the sound of boots on earth . The minutes drummed by . As they passed Tyne realized that the rider would not be back , that he might never be back . In the time that had been allotted to him he could have gone to the farmhouse and a couple of miles beyond . Probably the platoon would never know what had happened to him . He might have found a road that turned off , though there was no road marked on the map . Perhaps he had run into trouble beyond the bridge near the farmhouse , for beyond that bridge the road forked , and the Germans always were hell on crossroads . It was odd , Tyne thought , how many people you met in the Army who crossed your path for perhaps only a few seconds and then went on , never to be seen again . He could remember countlessoccasions and countless faces and countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could go into a store and talk to a clerk , but by the time you had left the store you had completelyforgotten the clerk 's face . It was different in war . You might see a man 's face in the flash of an exploding shell or in the cab of a truck or peering out of a slit trench , and though you had never seen the face before and never would see it again , you could n't forget it . War left impressions of unbelievable sharpness . P85It was almost as though men , in losing identity , gained identity . Their faces and voices became intense . They clung to the mind . They were like the hands of drowning men , reaching out of the water , refusing until the end to be devoured . " Take a break , " Porter said . " Tell them to take a break . " Abruptly , without blowing his whistle , he turned off the road and strode in among the trees . Tyne turned back to the column and held up his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loud , clear voice . " Take a break , " he called ahead to the scouts . The platoon moved off the road and into the trees . " Keep well back from the road , " Tyne said . He did not want to take any chances of something coming along and nailing them . " Archimbeau , you stay out close to the road . If you see that rider coming back , wave to him . " This last was for Porter 's benefit . Mumbling , Archimbeau walked back and settled down behind a bush close to the road . He had made up his mind that every dirty job in the Army was his personal property . He never missed . In the early days when they had wanted another KP it had always been Archimbeau who had been chosen . He had pulled guard more than anyone else in the outfit . He was always at the head of the column , where it hurt . And he was always crawling off on his belly somewhere . Sometimes Archimbeau wondered if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time to hang on . He thought sadly of a set of corporal 's stripes . In a decent outfit a guy who 'd done all the work he had would be a corporal easy . Even a sergeant , with luck . But it was just like this lousy outfit to leave you hanging around for years with nothing to show for it but calluses and bunions . A lousy outfit like this never even got around to replacing officers . Too god-damned economical . Solemnly Archimbeau spat into the bush , directly in front of his eyes . He decided he did n't like Italy any better than he liked any place else . They could have it . He 'd had it already . Tyne went over to where Porter was sitting under a tree , his head in his hands . He sat down beside him . " Feel bad , Eddie ? " he asked  | Porter raised his face from his hands . " Lousy , " he said . " I do n't know what the hell 's the matter with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were shaking slightly as though he had a fever . Tyne noted the fact and pursed his lips . " Maybe you 'd better not go on , " he said . " Oh , hell , I 've got to , " said Porter . " They gave me this job and I 've got to do it . It 'll be all right . " " We 'll get through , " Tyne said . His voice carried as much conviction as he could manage . For the last half hour he had been getting that old Lost Patrol feeling , though there was really no reason for him to have it . The platoon was anything but lost . They knew where they were , and even if they did n't they could damned well find out by going toward the sound of the guns . Listening to the artillery , he noted that the fight was keeping within what seemed to be almost like defined boundaries . It did not appear to be spreading at all . It was odd that there were no flank movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a flank movement ? The Lost Patrol feeling he blamed on Porter . He was the one who was doing all the worrying . Everyone else was keeping his head . He suddenly felt very angry at Porter . When he said something like " We 'll get through " he felt like a damned fool . This was n't the movies . " Something 's up with the sergeant , " Rivera said . He was lying on his stomach with his helmet off . His black hair was soaked and curly with sweat . " Which sergeant ? " Friedman asked . " Porter . " Private Cousins was lying with them . " I noticed it , " he said . " Nobody tells me nothing , " Friedman said . " . Keep your eyes open , " said Rivera . " If you were n't smoking your last butts all the time and getting smoke in your eyes you might know more about what 's going on . " " What 's the matter with Porter ? "   " How the hell do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just acting funny , that 's all . " " Working for a CDD , " Cousins said . " I 'm a Section 8 man myself , " Friedman said . " You said it , honey , " Rivera said . " Any time you want a certificate signed , just tap me on the shoulder . " " With an ax , " Friedman said . " The sergeant 's been acting funny all day , " Cousins said . " This is a hell of a platoon , " Rivera said . " In one morningwe 've lost one lieutenant and two non-coms , and have got anothernon-com feeling lousy . This platoon is hell on non-coms . " " Now I know why they want me to keep on being a private , " Friedman said . " They want to spare me from grief . " " That sure as hell is the reason , " Rivera said . " You ca n't say they ai n't thoughtful . " Sergeant Ward came over and sat down by Porter and Tyne . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeling bad ? " " He feels lousy , " Tyne said . Porter had put his head back in his hands . He did not look up when Ward spoke . " What 's the matter ? " Porter wanted to know . Tyne shrugged . " A guy can pick up anything in this kind of country , " Ward said philosophically . Porter raised his head . " Ward , " he said , " if I ca n't go on would you mind if Tyne took over ? " Ward pulled out a dry blade of grass and placed it between his teeth . He stared out toward the road and turned the blade of grass moodily over in his mouth . " It do n't make no difference to me , " he said . " I do n't care who 's boss . " " Tyne 's a good man , " Porter said . " I know he is , " said Ward . " You can work with him . " " I know I can . " " You can go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " said Porter . " I feel funny . I do n't even know whether I 'm sick or not . I just feel funny . Did you ever feel like you wanted to lie down and never get up ? " " Sure I have . " " That 's the way I feel . Like I wanted to lie down and never get up . " " A guy gets tired after a while , " said Ward . " You 've been at it a long time . " " We 've all been at it a long time , " Porter said . " Why do n't you lie down a while , Eddie ? " said Tyne . " You might feel better . " " I need a drink of water . " Porter fumbled at his canteen and pulled it out of its cloth case . He pulled the canteen cup away from the bottom and unscrewed the top . That was one of Porter 's idiosyncrasies : he never would drink from the mouth of the canteen , preferring always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie down . " He drank some water , screwed down the cap of the canteen , and laid cup and canteen beside him . Then he stretched out by the tree . Ward ran some of the soil through his fingers . " Poor dirt , " he said . " Poor country . " " Maybe if I rest , " Porter said . He closed his eyes . Archimbeau had watched the bubbles on his spittle for a long time . They fascinated him , reminding him of things insects made in the early morning at home . If you went out in the fields early you could see them . Spider spit , they were called . He did n't think spiders made them , but he supposed they could if they wanted to . Suddenly Archimbeau pricked up his ears . There was the sound of a motor down the road , coming toward them . It did n't sound like a motorcycle , but that did n't mean that it could n't be . These little hills could fool you . He raised himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the farmhouse the road rose to a slight crest and then dipped . Beyond the dip , perhaps a hundred yards away , was another , slightly higher hill . He could see the crest of it . And as he looked out from behind the bush hep89saw , poking over the brow of the far hill , not a motorcycle , not a tank , but a lovely gleaming new armored car . It was German , and what it was doing moving over the road in their direction Archimbeaudid n't wait to ask himself . He spun around , cupped his hands , and yelled " Armored car coming . Enemy armored car . Take cover ! " Then he fell flat behind his bush and took a grenade out of his pocket . Behind him the platoon scurried for cover . SOMETIMES IT almost seems as though a man can throw up cover and concealment in his imagination and have it work . He can lie flat on the ground and will that he wo n't be seen , and he wo n't be . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by willing it . This is the last , most desperate cover of all , but it works a surprising number of times . If you have time you can fix things so that no one would ever be able to find you , but you 've got to have the time . Even an hour can mean a lot . But it 's when the planes come down or they come over the hill and surprise you that you start trying to push your face and stomach into the ground . When there 's nothing over you it becomesnecessary to will things . Otherwise you 're a gone goose . That was the way it was when the armored car came poking over the hill . The platoon heard Archimbeau yell , and then they all dived for the trees . There was n't time to do anything else . They threw themselves behind the trunks and put their heads down and hung on . All of them , that is , except Porter . When he heard Archimbeau 's warning he merely rolled over on his stomach and burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps six inches thick and some three feet away from where he had been sitting . On one side of him Ward lay with his carbine beside him . He had his chin on the ground and was peering out toward the road . Tyne was conscious of Porter 's body , lying completely in the open . Near the road he could see the soles of Archimbeau 's feet where he lay behind his bush . The armored car was a small one , used for light reconnaissance and carrying a crew of two , with one machine-gun poking out of a sawed-off turret behind the driver . Archimbeau watched it come toward him . The car was battened down completely , and the crew must have been pretty confident that there was no one around , because the turret was keeping still . If they 'd been worriedthey 'd have revolved it . The car was traveling slowly , taking its time . Archimbeau watched it as it came closer . He prepared to pull the pin from his grenade . Then , thinking better of it , he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared on down in the direction from which they had come . Archimbeau whistled lightly between his teeth . He looked up the road . Nothing . He scrambled around and crawled back on his belly to where the platoon was hiding behind its trees . He saw Sergeant Porter lying on his stomach , facing away from the road . " Jesus Christ , Sarge , " he said . " That was close . " " Leave him alone , " Tyne said . " He 's sick . " They spoke in whispers , as though the crew of the armored car might hear them and come back . " What 's the matter with him ? " Archimbeau demanded . " Sick , " Tyre said . He came out from behind his tree and crouched down by Archimbeau . The platoon was beginning to show its heads again , peering out one and two at a time from behind the trunks and bushes that had served for concealment . " Just that one ? " Tyne asked . " Guess so , " Archimbeau said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good thing you did n't . What do you think , Ward ? " Sergeant Ward sat up behind his tree . " Damned if I know , " he said . " I do n't like it none . " " Go on back , Archimbeau , " Tyne said . " Keep your eyes open . "   " Why do I always have to pull this stuff ? " Archimbeau demanded . " How about somebody else for a change ? " Tyne was taking grenades out of his pocket . " Okay , " he said . " Get someone else . " " I 'll do it , " Riddle said . " Here , Arch , watch this god-damned gun . It gets in my way . " He tossed his rifle to Archimbeau , who caught it in mid-air . Then he crawled back to the bush behind which Archimbeau had been hidden . " I do n't think there 's more than one , " Tyne said . " If they were sending a column along they would n't start it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how things are holdingup down here . It 'll be coming back this way pretty soon . " He had completely forgotten Porter in the problem of the moment . Already he had reached the decision that the armored car would have to be got out of the way . He was n't sure exactly how , though . Probably grenades would have to do . " It 'll be back all right , " Ward said . " I do n't think we 've got a hell of a lot of time . But we can probably knock it off with grenades if we 're lucky . Those jobs do n't weigh more than a couple of tons . A grenade under her belly ought to lift her right off the road . It 'll shake up the driver , anyway . " Ward was toying with the bolt of his carbine . " How about machine-guns ? " he asked . " The tires , " Tyne said . " We can get the tires . I do n't know how much armor those babies carry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have anything like that in Africa , " Archimbeau said . " Old stuff , " said Ward . " They got a lot of old stuff they 're starting to use . " " It looked new . " " Paint . " Porter lay with . his face in his hands . His bulky body heaved softly . Tyne shook his shoulder . " Eddie , " he said . " Eddie . " " Leave me alone , " Porter said . He jerked his shoulder under Tyne 's hand . He was bad . It was n't shock or anything like that.  | It was just a piling up of war . Porter had lived on his nerves for a long time , but he was n't going to live off them any more . Porter was through , done . It had come quickly when it came . Yesterday he had been all right ; now he was finished . It comes as fast as that when it does come . Porter had had his share of it ; now he was for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward said . " Nothing you can do . " " No , " Tyne said . " What 's the best way to work it ? How about your squad ? Set them down by the road , as close as they can get , and throw grenades on the whistle . just on this side of the road , though . They 'll be tossing grenades in each other 's laps . Rivera ! " Rivera 's black head , helmetless , poked up from behind a decayingstump . " What 's up ? " " Come here , Rivera . " The addressed rose and came over in a crouching run . Behind him Friedman 's eyes watched him go . Rivera flopped down beside Tyne . " Got a butt , Corporal ? " " No . How 's your gun , doughfoot ? " " Okay . " " Set it up down there . " Tyne 's finger pointed to the fallen trunk of a tree a few yards from the road and about fifteen yards from where he was sitting , toward the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to try and get it with grenades . Now , when the grenades go off you let the car have it with all you 've got . Rake it . Compris ? " " Yeah . Sure . " " Get it up in a hurry . Damn little time . " " Right . " Rivera went back to his stump . " Better line up your squad , Ward , " Tyne said . Ward got to his feet . " Okay , my squad , " he said . " Off and on . " Here and there a man rose to his feet and came over to join his sergeant . " I got a job , " Rivera said . " They just hired me . A hundred bucks a minute . " " It ai n't enough , " Friedman said . " You coming ? " Rivera asked  | " You mean I 'm invited ? " " I got a silver-plated bullet with your name on it . Your name 's Appleglotz , ai n't it ? " " Yeah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then you 're invited . " " Then I 'll come . " " That 's good . Especially seeing as you 've got the ammo . " " Now , you 'll get a whistle , " Ward said . " And so help me , the first bastard that throws before he gets the whistle will get a grenade right between his teeth . And for God 's sake , throw straight . You wo n't get another chance . Johnson , you under-stand ? " " Yes , Sergeant . " " All right , then . You here . Randolph , you here . " Quietly Ward went about placing his men . One at a time the whole squad stretched out flat . Each man had a grenade in his right hand and another one lying beside him . Tyne watched Ward place his men . So far the operation looked good . " Archimbeau , " he said . " Watch Porter . Do n't let him run around . " He went over and joined Sergeant Ward . " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " do n't anyone else throw anything . Nobody at all , understand . We 'll have enough men throwing things as it is . Just stay back where you are and hang on . You 'll find out what happens soon enough . " He turned to Ward . " Anyway , we know what happened to that rider . " " Sure do , " Ward said . " The only thing is , did they get him before he got to the farmhouse or after he 'd crossed the bridge ? " " For all we know he never crossed the bridge . " " Well , if they 've got armor at the farmhouse we might just as well call the war off . I 've got to pick myself a tree . " " Remember , " Ward warned his squad . " On the whistle . " The platoon settled down to wait . Dimly between the trees the throb of artillery came to their ears , but they ignored it . They tried to hear over it , tried to catch the sound of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car returning up the road . Thep94car could n't have gone too far down ; as it was it was more or less protected by the trees , but if it came out in the open country , by the ditch , one of the planes would be certain to see it . The crew of the armored car probably knew that ; they 'd go down as far as they figured it was safe to go and then they 'd turn around and come back . They were just looking around , that was all , fronting for a far more powerful force farther inland . It was a problem , the armored car . Tyne ran over in his mind the pros and cons of smashing it . Now that he had made all the decisions he was n't sure that the decision to stop it was the right one . If the car did n't come back , whoever was up the road would think it funny ; they might even send out a more powerful force to see what had happened to it . They could probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the planes had come down on the road the Germans would have seen them ; they 'd have known what had stopped their shiny new armored car . But if the car did n't come back and there was no reason for its not coming back  --  no reason that the Germans could see , that is  --  they might choose to conduct a little investigation , with three or four tanks , say , and then it would be good-by platoon . On the other hand , if they let the armored car go back it might report everything clear , and then the heavy armor might come along anyway . It was a ticklish thing for a man to make up his mind about . Tyne decided the best thing to do would be to get the car , because while the Germans were wondering what had happened to it the platoon might be able to get where it had to go . If the German armor was still on the other side of the river they had a good chance of success ; if , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much matter one way or the other . Once they knocked off the armored car they 'd have to make time  --  good time . And they 'd have to go through the woods into the bargain . They could n't take the chance of meeting more vehicles on the road . They could n't take any more chances at all . Sun streamed through the trees and touched the dull barrel of Rivera 's gun . He had wheedled a stick of gum from Friedman ,  |p95and  he felt rather better about things in general . He sat with his legs around the gun , a brand-new belt running through it , waiting . Occasionally he would pivot the gun an inch or two either way . " Ever go to Coney Island ? " he asked . " All the time , " Friedman said . " Some joint . " " You ever shoot those electric guns that shoot down the air-planes ? " " Sure . I 'm a shark at that stuff . " " You want to know a secret , Friedman ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open book . You ai n't bright enough to have any secrets . " " This is a secret , Jakie . " " What the hell is it ? " " I never could hit those airplanes . I used to miss those airplanesall the time . " " Maybe I 'd better go away , " Friedman said . " Maybe you ai n't safe to be with . How 'd you get to be a machine-gunner ? " " I bribed a guy . " " I want a transfer . " " Friedman , it 's too late . You 're stuck with me . " " Where you going to get that car , Rivera ? " Rivera licked his thumb and touched it on the barrel of his gun . " I 'm going to get every god-damned tire she 's got . I 'm going to aim for the knees . Then I work north . " " You think this stuff will go through armor ? " " Never has yet . You ca n't tell , though . Did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " " It looked old to me . It looked like they been saving that car for the last quarter . The old college try . " " It 's still armor . " " You know Biddy Sims ? " " Corporal in B Company ? " " Yeah . " " What about him ? " " He got one of those big bastards with one of these babies.  | Explosive bullets . He just kept pounding away at the front of it . You pound away long enough and you 're sure as hell going to get a few through the slits . " I did n't know Biddy did that . " " He 's a quick boy . " " Where is he now , anyway ? " Rivera waved an expressive hand in the direction of the artilleryfire . " Down there , I guess . Maybe we been listening to him all morning , for all we know . " " Maybe he 's going to listen to us for awhile now . " " You said it , Jakie boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not understand what had happened to Porter ; it was somethingbeyond his comprehension . Wounds were simple . If a man was wounded he might yell or groan or keep his mouth shut , and whatever he did you knew what was the matter with him . But it was different with Porter . As he watched his big , heaving back Archimbeau was afraid , more afraid than he had been during the whole campaign . There was something terrible about the way Porter was crying . If he had been wounded it would have been a different story , but there was nothing the matter with him . He did n't have a mark on his body . It was as though something evil had entered him and shaken him the way a child shakes a rag doll and then thrown him down . Archimbeau felt that he would rather have been given any dirty detail than the one he had . He did not like to be with Porter . He felt that he had to do something . For a long time he stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down behind the tree that Tyne had been behind when the armored car had first come along . The tears trickled through Porter 's grubby fingers and dripped into the dry earth . Porter did not know why he was crying ; he . was hardly aware that he was crying at all . He had lost all track of the platoon and the objective and the war . He was beyond all of it . He dug the fingers of one hand into the ground . He wanted something solid under him ; he was tired of ideas and orders andP97the unknown . He was tired of guesswork and waiting and wondering if what was going to happen was what should happen . He had taken refuge in himself , and nothing would shake him out of that secret lair . Sergeant Porter had taken unto himself the final cover , the last concealment . He was unaware of the armored car ; he was unaware that it was day , and that there were noises in the distance , and that he was human . All that came through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over his shoulder Tyne looked at Porter . Nothing he could do . He fingered the whistle in his hand and then watched Riddle . Riddle had the best view of the road of any of them . He was peering anxiously down the dusty tracks ; occasionally he would look back and shake his head . Nothing . Tyne 's mind flashed ahead to the farmhouse . He tried to picture it . Must have a look at the map when this was done . There was no compass in his pocket ; he had lost the one he had in Sicily and had never replacedit . Probably Ward would have one or , failing that , Porter . They 'd have to go by compass through the woods . Tyne imagined that they had about a mile to go  --  certainly no farther . With luck they would be in the farmhouse within an hour . The arms of Private Riddle suddenly tensed and he reared up on them , peering out beyond his bush . He 's heard something , Tyne said to himself . He saw Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded his head in an affirmative . The armored car was coming back . " Easy , " Ward said in a low voice . His squad clung to the ground , their faces set . Riddle went flat again . He laid his face on the ground so that t here was a mere narrow slit between the grass and the rim of his helmet . From twenty feet away he would have resembled a small , remarkably smooth stone . In the slit between grass and helmet he framed the armored car as it came into sight . It was still battened clown , but the turret was motionless ; evidently the suspicions of the crew were lulled . They had gone down to the edge of the open country , had observed , and had seen nothing . Now , on their way back , Fthey were taking it easy . The car was moving at aboutp98twenty miles an hour , heaving as its wheels rose and sank in the ruts . It came closer . Rivera , behind his log , bent over the machinegun , lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath  --  not a definite tune , but simply a low murmuration of three or four notes . He sighted along the barrel and picked up the right front tire of the armored car . He held his sights there . It was necessary to give the car ten seconds ' leeway . Tyne closed his eyes for a fraction of a second in silent prayer that everything would go well . The car was almost at the spot he had picked . It was traveling at the speed he wanted it to travel . He counted slowly to himself . One . Two . Three . He brought the whistle swiftly up to his lips and blew it as hard as he could . Tyne was conscious of many arms moving back and throwing their missiles . The noise of the car seemed to become deafening . He knew that he should put his head down , but he could n't bring himself to do it . The armored car suddenly picked up speed . The driver had seen the grenades . Now it was directly abreast of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been counting aloud . " Nine , " he said . As he said it two of the grenades went off , one a few feet behind the car and another directly under it . The car rose like a bucking horse and fell back heavily . The nose pointed toward the side of the road . And even as it hit , the road exploded in a sheet of flame as the other grenades went off . Rivera 's machine-gun began its chatter . The car disappeared in smoke . Tyne felt something smash against the side of his helmet  --  probably a stone or a bit of steel . He tried to peer through the smoke . It was clearing , very slowly . Bits of rock began falling around him . " God damn it , Rivera shouted . " God-damned smoke . Any time you get a bead on something the god-damned smoke comes along . " He was firing blindly . Friedman tapped him on the shoulder . " The corporal says to hold it , " he shouted in his ear . Rivera looked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He released his finger from the trigger . The smoke had cleared around the armored car . It was lyingp99on its side . One wheel was spinning idly . The belly , facing them , was bent inward . There were no holes in it that they could see . " Rankin , " Tyne said . " Put a few shots through one of the slits . " Rankin hopped to his feet , his tommy-gun at the alert , and trotted out to the armored car . He put the gun in the driver 's eye slit and pulled the trigger . Lead smashed against the car 's interior as he moved the muzzle up and down . He put about thirty shots into the car . Probably the two men who made up the crew had been alive when he started shooting ; if so , they were not alive now . The platoon had no time to take prisoners . Tyne walked out to the car , Sergeant Ward at his heels . Two members of Ward 's squad started to follow them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing out here you have n't seen before . " He bent down and peered through the driver 's slit . It was full of smoke inside ; all around there was the bitter , acrid smell of burned powder . Dimly he could discern two crumpled figures . He suddenly realized that a hand was hanging limply very near his eye . There was a huge ring on the index finger . " Funny place to hive a ring , " he thought . It was a red stone , perhaps a ruby . Straightening , Tyne looked up the road in the direction of the farmhouse . " I do n't know whether they heard all the noise , " he said , " but whether they did or not we 'd better get the hell out of hire . There 's more where this came from " He kicked the car gently ; it gave off a hollow sound . " You got a compass , Ward ? " " Think so , " Ward said . He reached in his left pocket . " Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never had a bit of trouble with that compass . " He gave it to Tyne . Together they walked back intothe woods . " Get that gun down , doughfoot , " Tyne said as he passed ivera . " Some smoke screen , " Rivera said . " Like a christly battleship . " " ' That car 's probably full of holes , " Friedman said . " Like a cheese , " Rivera said . " Like a god-damned cheese . " " I 'll bet you never put a hole in it . " " I never miss . "   " How about the airplanes at Coney Island ? " " That was Coney Island . Those were airplanes . " " Okay , Rivera , you 're a terror . " " I sure as hell am . " " I 've got to take a look at the map , " Tyne said . " Got to get some sort of beam on that house . " " Porter 's got it , " Ward said . " I know . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying at Porter 's side . From it he pulled the map of the surrounding country , opened it , and spread it on the ground . It seemed that this was the fiftieth time that morning he had spread out the map . By rights it should have been frayed and torn , with all the handlingit had received . But it was new and neat and glossy . The only mark on it was a fingerprint in blood . That had probably come from Hoskins . " I 'm a killer , all right , " Rivera said . " I do n't know what this platoon would do without me . " " Win the god-damned war , " Friedman said . " That 's right , " said Rivera . " Win the god-damned war . " IT 'S woons all the way , " Tyne said , " if we 're where I think we are . " " It looks right , " Ward said . He wiggled his finger along the map . " The road twisted like hell in here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm , " Tyne said . " What 's the course ? " " West-south-west , I guess , " said Ward . " I 'd hold it right on there . Just about a mile to go . " Tyne measured with his index finger . " Just about . Take us a half hour if we move fast and hit it right . " The river cut around the farm and came toward them , aboutp101a quarter of a mile from where they were . If they got too far off in that direction the river would put them right ; on the other side was the road . They could hardly miss it . " How do we line up now ? " Tyne said . He surveyed the platoon . " Craven . " Craven , a sad-faced man , came over , swinging his helmet in his hand . He was nearly bald . " Take over my squad , will you , Craven ? " " Sure , Bill . " " Johnson , you stay here with the sergeant . Can you spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant . Do n't let him do anything . Just keep him here . Understand ? " " What if he tries to go somewhere ? " " Do n't let him . " " How ? " " I do n't care how . Do n't let him , that 's all . Wait a minute . " Tyne bent down by Porter and shook him gently . " How are you feeling , Eddie ? " Sergeant Porter 's nails dug into the ground . There was no other answer . " Okay , Johnson , " Tyne said . " Watch him . Arch , you and Cousins get going . If you see anything , just shoot . Let 's go . " The scouts moved out into the woods . " You got the direction , Arch ? " Tyne called after them . " Ca n't miss , " Archimbeau called back . Tyne fell into his place at the head of the column . To the sound of feet on leaves they moved through the woods , past Porter , past Johnson , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that they had knocked out the armored car had cheered them considerably . It no longer mattered that they were n't exactly sure where they were going or what they would find there . They had seen their own powers redisplayed . The morning had been bad , entirely bad , until they had run up against the car . Now the balance had shifted . They were no longer oppressed by what awaited them up ahead . They felt that they could handle it , together or singly . They had their morale back .   Not that they had ever really lost it . They had simply been a little uncertain of themselves . They were out of practice . But all in all they were a good platoon , a very good platoon . They worked well together ; for the most part they understood each other . That was an essential . In its way war is like a lethal game of football . The squad is a team , the platoon is a team , the company is a team .. So are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill two of them before they kill you : the thing is to kill two of theirs and stay alive . Moving between the trees , Archimbeau felt that he had had a bad morning . First there was Trasker and then the sergeant . He had almost forgotten Trasker now . What had happened to him had been a natural thing . It might have happened to anybody . But the sergeant haunted him . Any wound that was not caused by some external object terrified Archimbeau . " I am not afraid of drunks , " his mother once said , " but I 'm afraid of crazy people . " So was Archimbeau , the dutiful son , the lonely bachelor . Dimly he wondered if Porter had gone crazy . He knew it was n't shell -- shock , because he had seen guys get shell-shocked , and when that happened it was because a- shell had hit near them . Simple , like everything else in the Army . Simple , like the road to Tibet . But no shell had hit near Sergeant Porter . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archimbeau always thought that crazy people rar , around with knives . Maybe the sergeant was n't crazy after all Maybe he was just sick . He was not keeping a very careful watch . For one thing , there was n't much you could hide behind the trees , and there were no bushes to speak of . For another , he had decided that there was nothing on this side of the river . He did n't know why he had reached this decision ; he just felt that it was true . Archimbeau was a great man for intuition . " Did you ever go camping when you was a kid ? " Rivera asked . " Every time we get in a bunch of trees you ask me that same question , " Friedman said.  | " Every time I get in a bunch of trees I remember it , " said Rivera . " For the millionth time , no , I never went camping when I was x kid . I lived in the city . " " I lived in the city , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . " " You told me . " " Well , I 'm telling you again . " " You 're a juke box , Rivera . Somebody keeps putting nickels in you . " " I ai n't talking to you any more . Hey , Judson , you ever gc camping in the woods ? " " What woods ? " " Get that , will you ? Any woods . " " Naw . " " Judson , you do n't know what you missed . You ai n't ever lived until you toasted a mickey over the coals . It ai n't like the Army crap . You can sit around a campfire , see , and shoot it all night if you want to . You can go fishing . All that kind of stuff ' . " " Outdoor man , " ' Friedman said . " Next time they make you a civilian , Judson , " Rivera said , " try a camp in the woods . Just tell them I sent you . " " Tell who ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever tell you about the birds and the bees ? " " Naw . " " You hear that , Friedman ? Judson never heard of the birds and the bees . " Friedman was on firm ground now . " Terrible , " he said . " Shall we tell him ? " " Maybe we better . " Rivera held out his hand . " Give us a butt , Judson , and we " I tell you all about the birds and the bees . " " I ai n't got a butt , " Judson said sadly . In his mind Craven was trying to frame a letter to his sister . He figured that if he could think it out now he could write it later from memory and save time . " Dear Frances , " he began . " This is the first letter I have written you from Italy . I am now sitting down in an old farmhouse . We have just blown up a bridge near here . . . " No , that would n't do . Best to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this from somewhere in Italy but I do n't exactly know where because we have been moving so fast that I have n't had time to read the signs . " No , cross that out . "  --  Because we have n't seen any signs . For all I know it is n't even Italy but it will do until the next country comes along . It is a bright , sunny day , very warm , so maybe I am in Sunny Italy after all ( ha , ha ) and if I am I 'll send you a barrel of Chianti . " No , " Cianti . " Neither way seemed right . That was the hell of foreign words . Italian was as . bad as French . He turned to Private Tinker , who was walking beside him . " Tinker , " he said , " how do you spell Chianti ' ? " " What 's that ? " " It 's a wine . A wop wine . " " Never heard of it . " " What 's the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drink , " Tinker said . " You 've seen me drink . I never heard of the stuff , that 's all . " " It 's a red wine . You drink it with dinner and stuff . " " The hell with this wine junk . When I drink I want to feel I been drinking something . Applejack . Rye . That 's the stuff . " " Do n't you think I know it , for God 's sake ? " Craven said . " I was drinking that stuff when they were feeding you milk . I just wanted to know how to spell it , that 's all . " " Why ? " " I 'm writing to my sister . " Tinker stared at him . " What do you mean , you 're writing to your sister ? You 're walking through some god-damned woods , that 's what you 're doing . " " I 'm writing the letter in my head , see ? Then when I get a minute I just put down what I remember in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the best way . "  | " Jesus , " Tinker said , " what a system . Does it work ? " " Sure , " said Craven . " You just make up the letter in your head while you 're walking and then write it down later ? " " Yeah . " " Hey , that 's pretty good . Maybe I 'll try it . It works , huh ? " " Every time . " " Suppose you got a bad memory ? " " You got a bad memory ? " " I got a good one . " " Then why you worrying ? " " I 'm not . I just wondered . What was that word you wanted to spell ? " " Chianti . " Tinker wrinkled his brow . " Never heard of it , " he said . " They do n't have it in St. Paul . " The easiest thing would be to forget it , Craven decided . The easiest thing would be to begin again . " Dear Frances , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where because they have n't told me yet . I am well and hope you arc the same . Did you get a letter from Frank ? " There were little bare patches in the wood , as though someone had chopped down a dozen trees and dug out the stumps . Once they passed the foundation of a house , covered with dry grass . Time had played with it , and the forest had taken over . It was impossible to tell how old the house was . Tyne studied it carefullyas he went past . Italy , he knew , was full of ruins . Rome had the most of all . Perhaps the foundation was that of a Roman house , and perhaps they were the first who had seen it in two thousand years . But people had been in the woods since then . Here and there a stump stuck from the ground , and once he saw a faded piece of paper . Tyne remembered the ruins in Tunisia , standing by themselves miles from any human habitation . Little Arab boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the broken temples , and once a doughfoot , digging a slit trench , had broken through into a Roman grave , the grave of a woman . Time had left of her a pot of money and a few hairpins . It was enough ; it was a memorial . He looked at his watch . They had been on the move nearly a quarter of an hour ; nearly halfway on the last lap . When he thought of the farm he felt his spine tingle , as though somewhere in his body there was a buzzer that was a warning . He had always had that feeling when something was about to happen . First the buzzer would go and then he would feel weak . He wiped the sweat from his forehead ; it had run down into his eyebrows and from there was finding its way into his eyes . A tingle and a weak feeling . It was not necessarily a warning of danger . It was , on the contrary , the body preparing itself , releasingreserves of energy and strength  --  nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt rather giddy and lightheadedand confident . The giddiness was part of the weak feeling . It would pass . But the confidence would stay with him . Only when the platoon had done what it had been sent to do would the confidence leave him . Then he would sink into a melancholy . It was a reaction , and it had happened to him before . He was powerless to stop it . But while he had the confidence he would put it to good use . Archimbeau , he noticed , was getting too far ahead . He seemed in a hell of a hurry to get somewhere . Privates James and Carraway were talking about Life . " If you are n't on the ball , you have n't got a chance , " Private James said . " You got to be smart these days . " " I do n't know , " said Private Carraway . " Look at the freaks in the circus . " " Aw , they do n't count . They 're freaks . " " They ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I mean the average guy . " " The average guy ai n't smart , for Christ 's sake . " " That ai n't what I 'm trying to say , " Private James said . " Ip107mean that the competition is tough . If you do n't keep on the ball some bright boy is going to slip in and nab your job . That 's life . That 's what I was trying to say . " " If you 're good nobody 's going to take your job . " " That 's what I mean . You got to be good . " " You can be good and still be a dope , " said Carraway . " How do you get that ? " " All right , suppose you can run a machine better than anyone else . Do you have to have brains to run the machine ? Naw , you do n't need any brains . It 's a purely mechanical process . Anybody could learn to do it . " " All right , let 's get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The competition is tough . " " All right , it 's tough . " " Life ai n't no joke these days . " " All right , it ai n't a joke . Was it ever a joke ? " " How do I know ? I have n't lived all the time . " " How do you think a guy would like it , living all the time ? " " I would n't like it , " James said . " You 'd get in a rut . " " How do you mean ? " " History 's all the same . Life 's all the same . You 'd be doing the same thing all the time , over and over again . " " I 'd like to try it , just the same , " Carraway said . " There 'd still be the competition . " The sun was soaring toward the highest reaches of heaven . It blazed down malevolently . Their helmets became like ovens ; their clothes stuck to their bodies . They were bathed from head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uncomfortable , through either heat or cold , he finds it hard to think consecutively . His thoughts come in flashes . He is too conscious of his ever-present discomfort . The body , as always , thwarts the mind . The minutes develop a talent for moving slowly , for crawling around the face of the clock . Everything seems to stand still . The whole world simmers in a gigantic pot . The air actually has weight and body , and it seems to stagnate , like still water . Smells have a dull , un- pleasant pungency . It is difficult to think of food . Anything with an odor repels one . Yet Sergeant Ward still thought of apples . They were becoming a mirage , dancing in front of his eyes , dripping with juice . He would gladly have given three months ' pay for a cold apple , a big red juicy one . There was nothing cold he could have . The water in his canteen was tepid , and so was all the ration he carried . The thought of apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought of other images of a cold well and of cold well water , of cider cold and fresh from the jug , of ice cream . The new images did not help him . If anything they made things worse , and when he cast them out of his mind the idea of apples still flaunted itself and would not be shaken out . " Like to have an apple , " he said to Riddle . " Yeah , " Riddle said . " What I would n't give for a beer . A nice cold glass of beer . Just one . " " I been thinking of apples all day , " Ward said . " Apples and oranges , " said Riddle . " Funny thing is , I do n't like apples . " " A guy always wants something when he ca n't get it . " " Yeah . " The funny thing was that they were not very much concerned with what was facing them ahead . Each had his own problems , his own desires and wishes . They kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always done ever since they came into the Army . The war was incidental to a man 's thoughts . It entered into them , of course , but it did not take them over bodily . There had been too many years of life , too many memories , before the war had come along . A man could exist on these memories , he could withdraw into them , he could construct them into an unpierceable shell . They were his defence against the violence of the world . Every man in the platoon had his own thoughts as he walked along , and they hovered unseen over the little group , an indefinable armor , a protection against fate , an indestructible essence.  | " It 's a good thing they invented trains for traveling salesmen , " Rivera said . " All right , " Friedman said . " Kill me . What 's the gag ? " " No gag , " said Rivera . " But if they did n't have trains all the traveling salesmen would have to walk . A hell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling salesman , " Friedman said . " And you ai n't been taking any trains lately . " " What do you mean , I 'm a traveling salesman ? I 'm a mur-derer . " " You 're a traveling salesman . You 're selling democracy to the iniatives . " Rivera was silent for a moment . " So that 's what I am , huh ? Well , what do you know . Where 'd you get that crap , Jakie ? " " Out of a book . " " A book . " " You 're a decadent democrat , Rivera . " " That 's what I am , all right . But to get back to traveling salesmen , how many of those Joes do you think would of become raveling salesmen if they 'd had to walk everywheres ? " " I do n't know , " Friedman said . " I never knew a traveling salesman . " " Maybe I 'll be one after the war , " Rivera said . " You get to cover a hell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedman , " you 've covered a hell of a lot of territory , and you ai n't nothing . " " Friedman , " Rivera said , " I been good to you . Every time you needed it I always gave you my last franc . I treated you like a brother . And every time you get the chance you needle me up the back . What kind of stuff is that ? " " I 'm anti-social , " Friedman said . " I got gap-osis . " " Maybe you should go off somewhere . " " Where ? " " How should I know ? I treat you like a brother and you stick a knife in my back . He 's a crumb , ai n't he , Judson ? "   " Everybody 's a crumb , " Judson said . " I wish I was home in bed . " " Anybody who would sleep in the noontime is a dope , " said Rivera . " He 's a dope , " Friedman said . If the bridge was steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands . They 'd have one if it was concrete , too . If it was wood , though , it should n't be too much trouble . He ran over the possibilities in his mind . There was a chance that the bridge might already have been bombed and the Jerries only had a makeshift job crossing the river . That was a very good possibility . The planes had been bombing around this area for a couple of weeks . If they had knocked out the bridge and it had been repaired they could be sure it would be a wooden affair . Suddenly it dawned on Tyne that there had actually been no orders given to blow up a bridge at all . It had been decided within the platoon that the bridge had to be blown . It was very strange . Certainly if they had wanted to blow the bridge they would have sent the planes or , failing that , a bunch of demolition boys from the Engineers . It was damned queer . Tyne felt that he had to run over the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain . What was uncertain was whether or not the farmhouse was occupied by the enemy . That was point one . And there was a bridge . That was certain . What was uncertain was whether the bridge had already been blown or not . That was point two . And there were several courses of action . If the farmhouse was unoccupied and the bridge had n't been blown , they would have to blow the bridge and occupy the farmhouse . If the farmhouse was unoccupied and the bridge was blown , they 'd merely have to occupy the farmhouse and see that no one built up the bridge again . If the farmhouse was occupied and the bridge was blown , they 'd have to take the farmhouse and watch the bridge . That might not be easy . And if the farmhouse was occupied and the bridge was unblown , they 'd have a goodsizedchunk of hell , sitting up warm and wicked , right in theirp111hands . Four possibilities . Tyne tried to reason out the one that was probably right . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmhouse was empty , but that did n't hold water . The armored car had either come from the farmhouse or over the bridge , so it was safe to say that something ran across the water . The armored car would have had to get to the farm in the first place . And in that event the farm was occupied and the river was bridged . The more Tyne ran the picture through his mind the darker it became . At last he had reached the conclusion that the farmhouse might very well be occupied , and that there was some sort of bridge over the river . The Germans were never Inch to pass over river crossings . He suddenly whirled and strode back to where Ward was bringingup his squad . " I 've been thinking it over , " he said . " I think we 're going to run into trouble . " " I thought that all along , " Ward said quietly . " Jerry 's smart . He is n't missing a trick . " " I think they 've got someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly . " That 's what I think , " he said . " They probably got a machine-gun in every god-damned window in the place . " " They 've got something across the river , too , " Tyne said . " I do n't think it 's a regular bridge , but they 've got something . " " Yeah , " said Sergeant Ward . He was a man of opinion . Tyne went back to his place at the head of the column . Archimbeauwas getting even farther ahead . Tyne broke into a run , caught up with him , and caught him by the arm . " Take it easy , Arch , " he said . " Do n't get too far ahead . " " Did n't know I was , " Archimbeau said . " I was almost asleep on my feet . I did n't get any sleep at all last night . " " Well , keep awake now . " " Okay . Say , Corp , do you think I 'll make Pfc. by the Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general . " " That 's all I wanted to know . How much farther 's this farm ? " Lyne looked at his watch . " We ought to be breaking into the field below it any time now . Keep your eyes open , for God 's sake , and stop when you see the field . " " Right . " On his way back to his place Tyne winked at Rankin . " How 's it going , Tim ? " " I been here before , " Rankin said . By mutual consent , without any command being spoken , the men talked in whispers . They knew that they were approaching their objective . They walked more lightly and they began to look around them , peering through the trees as though they expected to see someone . The woods had suddenly become dangerous . No one could say at what point they had taken on a menacing aspect , but it had happened in a twinkling . Perhaps it had been when Tyne had run up toward the scouts . Any unforeseen movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert . Tenseness came over them , and their legs felt stiff . They almost seemed to walk stiff-legged , like angry dogs . The war had finally caught up with them . Rankin looked at his tommy-gun . It was beautifully oiled and in perfect condition . Rankin took good care of his gun ; he treated it as though it were a highly sensitive infant . He slept with it cradled beside him . There was only one thing about it that made it stand out , however . Scratched on its barrel were eleven lines . The eleven lines stood for soldiers of the Third Reich -- for exsupermen  --  molderinginto dust in Tunisia and Sicily . They were Rankin 's certains ; he never counted the probables . " Some day , " Rivera said , " I 'm going to walk into a country and they 're going to put out a rug that says Welcome ' and they 're going to let me walk in on it . That 's what I 'm going to do someay.99 " When ? " Friedman asked . " Next Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know when ? In 1983 . " " I 'll look you up then . " " This is a hell of a way to see Europe . "   " Ah , if it had n't been for this war the nearest you 'd ever of got to Europe would be the Staten Island ferry . " " Anybody can go to Europe . I know a guy worked his way over on a cattle boat . " " Why ? " " He wanted to see it . " " He must have been a hell of a dope . " " He was my cousin . " " Then I know he was a hell of a dope . " " After we get up to this farmhouse I 'm going to take you out in the dung shed and beat the bejesus out of you . " " What with ? " " The barrel of this god-damned gun . " " Okay . I thought you were going to really get tough . " " That farmhouse is sure as hell full of Krauts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedman , I 'm glad I brought this gun along . I 'm glad they gave it to me . " " Between you and me , old boy , I am too . " " A butt . " Friedman sighed . " I can remember the days when I had one , " he said . Archimbeau 's arm went straight up in the air and he stopped in his tracks . Every man in the column fell suddenly silent . Tyne walked ahead . " Coming out of the woods , " Archimbeau said . He pointed . In the direction of his finger , perhaps fifty yards away , ' Fyne could see light through the trees and a gentle brown slope . " ' That 's it , all right , " he said . Ward came along . " On the nose , " he said . " On the nose . " " What do you think ? " " I do n't know yet . I 'm going up and take a look . Arch , you o me along . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Archimbeau moved through the trees . Tyne carried his rifle loosely in his right hand ; Archimbeau had his on the sling . As they moved away from the platoon the wood seemed to open up like a flower . Light streamed in on them , reflected from the field . They walked slower and slower . Once Tyne thought he caught the glint of something far up in the field  --  it could have been a helmet  --  and he stopped in his tracks . It was almost as though he were sniffing the air . Then he moved on , more cautiously . Archimbeau followed closely at his heels . When they were almost at the edge of the wood Tyne could see an old wall , made of some kind of stone and mortar , running along the fringe of trees . He fell on his belly and wiggled the last few yards to the wall , Archimbeau crawling behind him . And then , when they were both safely behind the wall , Tyne cautiouslyraised his head and peered out on the field  --  a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late insects . THE FIELD was a hill that stretched a hundred and fifty yards up to a farmhouse with a red tile roof . Here and there a boulder marred its surface , and there were patches where the grass lay flat . It looked as though it had been trampled . Tyne counted four outbuildings ; it was quite a large farm . The house had been painted or whitewashed quite recently . He could see no movement around the buildings . " I wish to God I had those binoculars now , " he said . " Can you see anything ? " " Not a damned thing . " " How about the windows ? " " Sun 's on them . " To the right the wood curved around , along what evidently was the bank of the river . The wall seemed to stop down there . " I wish I knew , " Tyne said . " I wish to God I knew . "   " Knew what ? " Archimbeau asked . " Nothing . Let 's go back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyne stood up . Archimbeau also rose , and they broke into a fast walk . The platoon was waiting for them . Half the men were sitting or lying down ; the rest were leaning against trees or just standing around . " How 's it look ? " Ward said . " Quiet . But I do n't like it . Too quiet . " Ward nodded . " They 're bad when they 're too quiet . " " Craven , " Tyne said . He fell on his knees and picked up a stick . Craven came over to where he was kneeling , and Tyne drew a rough line along the ground . " There 's a stone wall that runs along here for about two or three hundred yards , probably between the road and the river . There 's a clear slope up to the farmhouse from the wall . Not much cover . The wall seems to stop where the river curves around the farm , but there are trees runningalong the river bank . There does n't seem to be any movementamong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the story is . If I had a pair of binoculars I 'd have been able to see more . " " Think there 's anyone there ? " Craven asked . " That 's what I do n't know , " said Tyne . " Anyway , we are n't going to take any chances . We 'll send a patrol up first , four or five guys . " " I 'll take it , " Ward said suddenly . " I may need you here , " Tyne said . " I want to take it , " Ward said . Tyne studied his face . " Okay , " he said . " You take it . Pick yinirself four men . " " I 'll go , " Rivera said . " No , you wo n't , doughfoot , " Tyne said . " I need your little inst rument . " " I want four volunteers , " Ward said . " Four Congressional-7 i **40;9459;TOOLONG volunteers . " " Any extra pay ? " Rankin wanted to know . " Naw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rankin said . " Just to make them feel ashamed . " " I 'm a hero , " Cousins said . " I been up front all day . I might as well stay there . " " I 'll go along , " Tranella said . " The first guys that get to that house will get the wine , " Tinker said . " I 'll go . " " Okay , " Ward said . " That 's four . " " Pass out the Purple Hearts , mother , " Rivera said . " All right , " Tyne said . " We 'll go up to the wall in column , then fan out when we get there . The wall 's three feet high . There 's plenty of room . But do n't let me catch any son of a bitch sticking his head up in the air . When you fan out keep about five yards apart . Craven , you take your squad down toward the road . Riddle , you take Ward 's squad down toward the river . My squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your popgun down by the road , so you can keep your eye on the farmhouse and the road at the same time . Got that , dough-foot ? " " It 's in my head , " Rivera said . " Keep it there . And remember to cover if anyone needs it . " " Okay , chief . " " Let 's go . " Tyne moved through the woods . The platoon straggled after him , moving as silently as Indians . As Tyne came nearer to the field he was struck with the same feeling of the wood 's unfolding like a flower that he had had the first time . He hit the dirt at almost the same place as before . One by one the men flopped down after him . He stopped at the wall and directed traffic , to right and left . The men wiggled along the wall or moved at a crouch , careful not to hunch their backs too high . Ward and his volunteers hugged the wall near Tyne . " Might as well go over right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess so , " he said . " Maybe we 're getting worried for nothing . Maybe there 's no one up there after all . "   " I think there is , " Ward said . " What are you going to do ? " " Well , " Ward said , " if we can get within grenade-throwing distance we 'll be all right . Let me take a look and see . " He raised his head a little over the wall and studied the terrain . When he pulled his head down again he was frowning . " Do n't look too good at that , " he said . " A few boulders , but not a hell of a lot else . That grass wo n't do much good . " " It 'll help , " Tyne said . " Yeah , it 'll help . " Most of the men were in position . " We 'll wait till Rivera gets his gun up , " Tyne said . " Give him five minutes . If anything goes wrong he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoot for the windows , " Ward said . " That 's where they 'll be . They like the windows . " " I know . " Warily Tyne took another look over the wall . Things did not Fccm to have changed . Nothing had moved around the farmhouse . The windows still reflected the sun . Certainly there was nothing about the farm to arouse suspicion . But that was the way it always was . The things to watch out for were the things that looked innocent . That was the principle of booby traps . " Why are you so anxious to take a patrol ? " Tyne asked . " I do n't know , " Ward said . " I just am . " Down at the far end of the woods , by the road , Rivera and riedman were finishing setting up the gun . " You can hit anylingfrom here , " Friedman said . " They ought to have portable ails to go with every war . " " I 'll see they have them next time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disappointed . " " This is a pretty good spot . " " It 'll do for awhile . I ai n't planning to raise a family here . " " How 's the farm look ? " " I 'll rake that joint . "  | " I think it 's okay , " Tyne said . " Got enough grenades ? " " Yeah , " Ward said . He studied the four men who were to go with him . " We 'll stay five yards apart , " he said . " And keep on your gut , for God 's sake . Spread out , now . " The four men strung themselves along behind the wall . " Good luck , " Tyne said . " The same to you , " Ward said . He looked to the right and left . " Over , " he said . He leaped over the wall and lay flat in the grass . The other men followed him . All up and down the line of the wall there was silence . Silence hung over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dull rumble of artillery , but it was cut off in great measure by the intervening woods . Ward hugged the ground , listening . He could see none of the other members of the patrol because of the high grass . Now he wished he had not had them stay five yards apart : . A guy could wander away , especially if he was on the end . Stiffly Ward began to move forward . The patrol had a long way to go . He moved fast . Near him he could hear the other men moving forward . Beneath the grass the ground was rough . It stuck to his sweat-soaked fatigues . He seemed to grate on the earth as he crawled along . A boulder reared before him , and he skirted it . As he did so he caught sight of Tinker in a bare patch . He winked at him . Tinker licked his lips with his tongue and made a half-wave . Tyne slowly raised his head over the wall . The patrol was movingsteadily up the slope . He could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the waving of the grass . One of the figures was in a bare patch , the other was behind a boulder . They had gone perhaps fifty yards . Suddenly , as though by instinct , he knew that something was going to happen . It was like those times when people see a man who is actually dying a thousand miles away . One moment everything was all right , and the next Tyne wanted to yell out for the patrol to come back . He saw smoke drift from one of the windows of the house , andp119the next minute the noise of a machine-gun came to his ears . The Germans had opened up . The farm was occupied , all right , very well occupied . Tyne jerked his head down , looked at the man nearest him , and shook his head . " God damn , " he said over and over again . " God damn . God damn . God damn . " The machine-gun had started up so suddenly that it had taken Ward by surprise . Off to his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was too hot a place , much too hot . " Go back , " he yelled . " Patrol back . " He turned around and began to crawl down the slope . He could see the wall beckoning to him . It was hard to believe that anything so near could be so far away . He passed the boulder again and saw Tinker again , crawling back with him . This time he did not wink . He hugged the ground as a line of bullets parted the air over his head . Slowly Tyne peered over the wall again . Why the hell did n't they come back ? But they were coming . Good . He could see the grass waving as they worked their way toward the wall , and he could see the grass swaying as the machine-gun traversed it . " Tell Rivera to let her go , " he said to the man on his left . The word went down the line . Ward was wondering why Rivera did n't open up . He was cut ff from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or of any of them had been hit . He was conscious only of his ownorts and the wall luring him on . His mouth was very dry , and he gretted coming out with the patrol . There had been just a chance at the farm had been unoccupied . He had known the chance as slim  --  he had n't believed it himself , but he had wanted too it . He dug dirt again as a row of bullets passed over him . " Jesus Christ , here goes , " Rivera said . The gun jumped and ivcred before him . Far away , along the wall of the house , riedman could see dust rise as the slugs cut into the mortar . " Get at bloody window , " he said . Rivera obligingly lowered the urzle of the gun an almost imperceptible distance . Bulletsached through the window and into the house . The German whine-gun went suddenly silent.  | " Let me be the first to congratulate you , " Friedman said solemnly . He held out his hand . Ward heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and music to him . He stopped and listened . He was almost certain he could hear Rivera 's slugs smash into the side of the house . Behind him the German machine-gun went dead . He raised his head and took a quick look over his shoulder . Dust and mortar were flying from the house and glass spattered from the windows as Rivera raked it back and forth . Ward grinned mirthlessly . Rivera kept his finger on the trigger . Might as well make a run for it , Ward said to himself . He calculated the distance to the wall . It was perhaps twenty yards , an easy run . Ward did not bother to think the situation out in any detail . There was n't time . He suddenly stood upright in the field . " Cousins , Rankin , " he shouted . " Everybody over the wall . " Three figures rose up from the grass . They all bolted for the long wall . Rivera 's gun chattered on . Five yards from the wall SergeantWard heard rifle fire from the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went over the wall head first , in a giddy dive . Cousins and Tranella leaped after him . Tinker was slow , at least two yards behind the others . He was n't zigzagging . As he reached the wall there were three scattered shots from the house . Tinker tossed his rifle in the air and fell forward against the wall , his body half crawling up the rough stone . His hand hung over the top . Far away , on the left , Rivera 's gun stopped firing . Ward lay flat for a moment . His leap had nearly knocked the wind out of him , and he gasped , trying to catch his breath . Tyne crawled over to him . He patted Ward 's sweat-soaked back . " You should n't have tried it , " he said . " You just should n't have tried it . Ward sat up . " Everyone get back ? " he asked . He took a deep breath and looked around him . " They got Tinker , " Tyne said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " " I thought there was only three , " Ward said . " Jesus , is that Tinker ? " He was looking at the hand that appeared over the wall . P121Tyne nodded . " Why do n't you pull him in ? " " What 's the use ? He 's dead . " " How do you know he 's dead ? " " I can tell when a man 's dead . " " Oh , hell , " Ward said . " What a god-damned mess . What a doody , god-damned mess . " " It could have been worse . They could have waited until you were all up there and then let you have it . It could have been a hell of a lot worse . " " It 's bad enough , " said Ward . Tyne looked at Cousins and Tranella . " You all right ? " " In the pink , " Tranella said . Cousins nodded . " Tough luck , " Tyne said . He turned back to Ward . " Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , " Ward said . " There 's no element of surprise , and they 've got us cold . They know where we are and where we want to get to , and they probablyknow every way we 'll use to try and get where we want to go . They 've probably got a machine-gun in every window of that house . No one could get near enough to use a grenade . " " I wish to Christ we had a mortar , " Ward said . " It never happens the way you want it to happen , " said Tyne . " If we had a mortar there 'd be nothing to it . " " But we have n't got a mortar . " " No . " " How about waiting till dark ? " " We ca n't wait till dark , " Tyne said . " We 've got to get in there d get in there fast . I wish to God I could make them think e 've got a mortar . " " Yeah , " Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do . " Rivera spat on the barrel of his gun . The spittle rolled down , idling . " I 'm a marksman , " he said . " A marksman first class . "  | " I wonder who they knocked off , " Friedman said . " Too damn far away to see . " " I hope it 's Ward , " Rivera said . " Ward gives me a pain in the pratt . All the sergeants give me a pain in the pratt . " " Tyne 's all right , " Friedman said . " Yeah , Tyne 's all right . But he ai n't a sergeant . " " He probably will be . " " Then he 'll give me a pain in the pratt . " Friedman stared down along the wall . The figure lying against it puzzled him . Within him he had a desperate urge to know who it was . He liked some men in the platoon better than others ; he did n't want the body to be that of someone he liked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be the body of anyone he knew , anyonehe had worked with . " He 's a big guy , whoever he is , " he said . " There 's somebody else out in the field , " Rivera said noncommittally . " I know it . Did n't see him get hit , though . " " Ah , it was beautiful . The way I messed up that house was beautiful . I could do that fifty times a day . " " You 'd better keep your eyes open , " Friedman said , " or they 'll be sending a halfback around this end with a grenade stuck in his mitt . They 'll only have to do that once a day . " " The hell with it , " said Rivera . " I 've seen them coming around my end by the millions . They never gained a yard around my end . I 'm indestructible . Nobody dies . " " Okay , corpse , " said Private Friedman . It was up to Tyne . Responsibility weighed on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head over the wall , behind Tinker 's hand . The farmhouse was quiet again . It might have been a farm on a normal busy day , with all the men out in the fields and all the women in the kitchen . It did not look like a theater of war . It seemed quiet , peaceful . It reminded Tyne vaguely of pictures he had seen on calendars in garages and grocery stores . You could sit in that place on the side of the road and be a friend to man.  |p123T-z-i-n-g-g-g  . He hit the ground as a bullet ricocheted from the wall and went whizzing off in the woods . " Close , " he said . " Somebody up there 's careless with firearms . " Cousins grinned appreciatively , and Tyne felt better . The joke was an old one , but he supposed it was what he should say under the circumstances . " They 've got us cold , " he said to Ward . " Pretty and cold . " " It 's no place for a gentleman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , teacher , can I leave the room ? " " You and Tinker , " Ward said . Tranella 's hand came suddenly down , and he swallowed . " We should have given you some cover too , " Tyne said . Ward shrugged . " What the hell , it would n't have made any difference . All I hope is they have n't put through a call to send a couple of tanks . That would really screw us . " The thought of tanks chilled Tyne . He caught himself . " I do n't think they will , " he said . " We 've got a lot of planes around here . They 're probably afraid the planes would see the tanks . " " What makes you think so ? " Ward asked . " I just got a feeling . " " I just got a feeling , too , " Ward admitted . " I wonder if Rankin 's dead . " For a moment Tyne had forgotten Rankin . Now he found himselfremembering him with some embarrassment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's safe where he is , I guess . He can hang on . " " Yeah , if anyone can hang on Rankin can hang on . " Privates Carraway and James were lying on their stomachs , talking about nature . Private James had a leaf in his hand . They had developed , over a period of months , a core of hardness to anything that might happen . Already they had forgotten Rankin and Tinker . It was as though they had never existed . " Now take this leaf , " Private James said . " Look at the complications . Think of all the trouble it took to make this leaf . You never saw nothing as complicated as that . " " I 'm as complicated as that , " said Private Carraway . " The human body is the god-damned most complicated thing in the world . " " It ai n't no more complicated than this leaf . " " Ah , sure it is . That leaf 's just a little thing . The human body 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Private James . " It 's got a lot more to be complicated about . This leaf ai n't got anything to be complicatedabout when you come right down to it . " " What 's so fancy about it ? " " Look at the veins , for instance . " " You mean to tell me that leaves ' veins is more fancy than human veins ? " " I did n't say that . I only said look at them . " " All right , " Carraway said . " I 'm looking at them . So what ? " " They 're fancy . " " Ah , for Christ 's sake , " Carraway said . " I got no time for nature study . There 's a war on . " " Never heard of it , " said Private James innocently . But he threw his leaf away . The map came out again , and again was spread on the ground . " The trouble with this map is that there 's no detail about the farm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the river , but we knew that anyway . It does n't show anything new at all . We might just as well toss it away . " Craven had crawled over to see what was going on . " How about the river ? " he asked . " What about it ? " Tyne wanted to know . He ran his finger over the blue line on the map that marked it off , as though by the mere pressure of the flesh it could actually become water . " Maybe we can circle the farm by the river , " Craven said . " We can crawl along the bank . " The map once more became the object of study . How dead the symbols are ! Tyne thought . They are meaningless , like flies crawling on a wall . He looked at the little black rectangles that signified the farm buildings , then at the elliptical lines that stoodP125for the wall . They were cold and empty . " The only thing is , " he said , " we do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There 's one way to find out , " Ward said . " What 's that ? " " Send a patrol . " Tyne shook his head violently . " No , " he said . " There is n't time any more . We 've got to get in there , that 's all . " " How about forgetting the farm entirely ? " Craven said . " How about just crawling down the wall , then wading along this bank of the river until we get to the bridge and then blow her ? " It sounded good . " Idea , " Ward said . Tyne stared at the map without speaking . He was looking at the location of the bridge . Whether it had been blown or not would make little difference to its position . If it had been blown the Germans would have put up some sort of pontoon affair right beside the old one , so that they could run back on to the road again . It looked as though there might be a bit of rock between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that it could n't be seen from the windows . And there was also the chance that the Germans had no defences around the bridge . Perhaps they thought the farmhouse was enough protection . The Germans were so methodical that they always left something undone . They were too methodical . " It does n't sound bad , " he said . " Hell , no , " Ward said . " Best thing we can do . " " We 've got to work fast , " Tyne said . He looked at his watch . " Damned fast . " " Well , let 's go , " said Ward . " Best thing 's a patrol . Four or five men . " Tyne was dubious . " I do n't know , " he said . " Perhaps there ought to be more . If there is anyone on the bridge four or five own can get tied up very nicely . I 'd rather send two big patrols . bay ten men in each . Send them one after the other . Then if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch in . That 's the most logical thing . " " Whatever you want , " Ward said . " Tyne folded the map very carefully . " The best thing would be a diversion . How long do you think it would take to get over around the farm , Ward ? " Ward thought for a moment . " Ought to allow about half an hour , " he said . " Yeah , just about a half an hour . " " That 's fast moving , " Craven said . " All right . " Tyne nodded agreement . " What we 'll do is this . Ward , you take one patrol and go first . Craven , you take the other one . I 'll stay here with the rest of the platoon . We 'll give you exactly a half an hour . Then we 'll hop over the wall and head for the house . You 'll know when we start , because I 'll put Rivera to work . You ca n't help but know . The Krauts will think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay us all the attention . Then you blow the bridge . As soon as we hear you blow it we 'll all get up and rush the joint . How does that sound ? " Two vertical lines appeared at the bridge of Ward 's nose . He was running the idea over in his head . " Yeah , " he said finally . " It sounds right . How about you , Craven ? " " I do n't know , " Craven said . " I think they ought to start after twenty minutes . Then the Heinies might not pay so much attention to what 's going on behind the house . " " You 're right , " Tyne said . " I never thought of it . Well , that 's the story , then . I guess it 's about the best we can do . " " You 've cut yourself out a tough job , " said Ward . " Suicide , " Tyne said . " I 'm a hero . We 're all heroes . This 'll mean the Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craven said . " It might be a breeze . " " It might be , " said Tyne . " But I do n't think so . " The men were lounging behind the wall , taking it easy . They did n't seem very much concerned about what was going to happen . Some of them were at their rations . A man can get hungry almost anywhere , under almost any circumstances . The stomach is a sensitive instrument , the seat of many things besides hunger , but it is still a very demanding instrument . Condemned men can eat a hearty breakfast , at least for the benefit of the yellow press . The soldier , who does not necessarily consider himself con/demned to anything more than utter boredom , can eat a hearty meal at any time . The men were not even interested in Tinker 's hand , poised above the wall . They had seen such things before . It was very much like going to a bad movie for the second time . It was wonderful what could bore them after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Ward came among them , picking out his patrol , they were not moved one way or another . What they were about to do was merely a job , and they had probably been on worse jobs before . That , in itself , was one way to make things seem better . Cousins , for instance , swore that none of the action he had seen  --  and he had seen a great deal  --  had been comparable to the Louisiana maneuvers . The idea was to convince yourself that nothing that could come could possibly be as bad as what had gone before . You could last that way ; you could last a long time that way . They went with Ward and they went with Craven , and the men who were to go with Tyne went to him calmly . It was the war . It was the job . It was their job . Get it done and then relax , that was the thing to do . Tyne talked to them and they listened . The plan was simple , beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go wrong . They listened carefully , nodding their heads occasionally , letting Tyne 's words sink in . And when he was through they sat looking at him or studied their rifles or rubbed their hands slowly together as though the joints were aching . SOMEBODY 'S COMING up here , " Friedman said . " Maybe it 's Marlene Dietrich , " Rivera said . " Has he got legs ? " " I ca n't see , " Friedman said . " It 's the way they walk in the Army . It 's Joe Jack . " Private Jack came crawling toward them , sometimes rising to his feet and going into a crouching run . He often acted as corn- pany runner , and it was his proud boast that more bullets had missed him than anyone else in the Army . He had a charmed life , had Private Jack . " Why the hell they always stick you out in left field ? " he panted as he came up to the machine-gun . " Why do n't you ever hang around where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ways to do things , " Rivera said solemnly . " The right way , the wrong way , and the Army way . It 's the Army way to stick me out in left field . What you got , Joe ? " " Message from Tyne , " Jack said . He passed over a folded paper . Rivera opened it slowly . " Wish I had my glasses , " he said . " Cut it , " Friedman said . " What 's he say ? " " Dough foot , ' " Rivera read . " Two patrols going try go round farm via river . I taking rest platoon over field . When blow my whistle synchronize watch 1215 hrs . Five minutes after going up field on dot . Give cover 15 seconds before . Give cover up field . Remember , cover at 1219 and 45 secs . Hope ammo holds out . We are going all the way . ' That 's all . " " How 's he sign it ? " Friedman wanted to know . " Tyne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Formal , ai n't he ? " Rivera looked at his watch . " If this thing is right it 's only two minutes to 1215 . The patrols left , Joe ? " " Yeah , they left before I came here . " " Okay , hop back and say we 're all set . Tell Tyne I said good luck . " " I 'll tell him , Rivera . " Jack turned and started back in his crouching run . Rivera looked carefully at the dial of his watch . " Nobody dies , " he said . " How 's the ammo ? " " It 's been worse , " Friedman said . " And it 's been better . " " Tyne really cut himself a piece of cake , " Rivera said . He studied the note . " Hey , Friedman , what 's this mean ? Five minutes after going up field on dot . ' I do n't get it . " " Let 's see the note , " Friedman said . He took it and peered closely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I get it , " heP129said . " He means that five minutes after he blows his whistle they 're going up the field . He wants you to go to work fifteen seconds before . " " That it ? " Rivera took the note back . " Suppose they 'll give me money for overtime ? " " Ah , sure , " said Friedman . " Jesus , " Rivera said , " that 's a tricky business . " Friedman looked glum . " Looks like we 'll be getting a new platoon pretty soon . " " Yeah , " Rivera said . Then suddenly the mask of lightness dropped from his face . He looked worn and angry and his dark eyes flashed . " God damn it , " he burst out , " why do n't they ever give them a chance ? They never get a chance . We 're the dirty god-damned Infantry and they stick us in everywhere . Jesus , there 's a hell of a lot of good men going down in this war . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God that I had every Nazi right in the palm of my hand . I 'd crush them to a pulp . Why the hell do n't they let us alone ? " He subsided as quickly as he had begun . " Yeah , " Friedman said . Rivera looked at his watch again . " It wo n't be long now , " he said . " A whole new god-damned platoon . " Tyne watched the patrols go , wiggling along by the wall , their backs turned toward him . He wondered vaguely how many of the faces he would ever see again . Then he shook himself . That was the wrong kind of idea to have . It was just a job , that was all , just a job . Like any other job . It was n't any more risky than working in a steel mill  --  not even as risky , perhaps . It was all in the point of view . The twenty-five men who were to go up the field with him were spread up and down the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faces that he could see , looked set and tired . He glanced at his watch . Two minutes to go till 1215 . He looked up to see if he could see Jack . There was no sign of him . Behind his head , with a foot of wall between them , Tinker'shand reared limply toward the sky . Tyne was vaguely conscious of it , as though it were trying to touch his back .   Ward had gone off almost carelessly . So had they all . That was the only way to go , as though one would be back in a few minutes , as though one were just running down to the corner for a paper or to make a phone call . When it was done that way it was easy . And it was always done that way ; the dragged-out goodbyswere always reserved for the movies . Tyne knew , however , that Ward did not expect him to get across the field . Ward thought he was throwing himself away . They had argued about it , not in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrols would be enough , without any diversion . Craven had thought the same thing . But Tyne was in command of the platoon . He thought a diversion was needed , and a diversion there would be . He was not afraid . He was not even worried . Everything , he kept telling himself , was going to be all right . Everythingwas going to be just lovely . Silently Ward slid into the river . Now that he was down there things looked better than he had hoped they would . There was a solid screen of reeds and bushes between them and the farmhouse . It looked clear ahead . The river was not more than seventy-fivefeet across , but it was deep . Even by the bank he went in to his ribs . But as set-ups went , it did n't look too bad . Tranella splashed down behind him . Ward whirled around . " Take it easy , for God 's sake , " he whispered . " Sorry , Sarge , " Tranella said . " Slipped . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the water . Ward carried no rifle . He had a .45 in his left hand and a grenade in his right . Only three men in each patrol carried rifles . They were more in the way than anything else . Behind Ward 's patrol Craven entered the water , catching his breath as he did so . He was still trying to write that letter , but it - kept taking curious twists in his mind . Right now it read : " Dear Frances , I am just back from going swimming in a river somewhere in Italy and we have just blown up the bridge so that anybody who tries to cross the river will have to go swimming , too . " P131He was composing the letter subconsciously . Perhaps he ought to write one for Tinker , too . Tinker had been interested . " Dear Mom , I am now sleeping against a wall Somewhere in Italy . It is n't very comfortable but a man has to lie where he can these days . If you ever get to Italy you must come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He caught at a bush to steady himself as his foot stepped on an object under the water . Then , steadied , he waded on . The water was strangely cold for such a hot day . Or perhaps it seemed cold because the day was so hot . Craven was n't sure . It was hard to be sure of things . Tyne saw Jack coming toward him , coming back from Rivera . He had made good time , but there was n't a lot to spare . He looked at his watch . Forty seconds to go before he blew his whistle . The patrols had been out for fifteen minutes . " How 'd it go ? " he asked as Jack came up to him . " Rivera says it 's okay , " Jack said . " He said good luck . " " Nice of him , " Tyne said . He looked at his watch and put the whistle to his lips . Every other watch was synchronized ; only Rivera had to be checked . A few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be surprised when Tyne blew his whistle . He puffed out his cheeks and let go . " Right on the nose , " Rivera said . " Even the lousy second hand was right on the nose . " " That 's not an Army watch , " Friedman said . " What kind of a watch is that ? " " Just a watch , " Rivera said . " It works . " " I 'm slow . " " How much time is it now ? Oh , yeah , four minutes , forty-five seconds . Honest to God , I 'm going to cut that house right in two . " " If the ammo holds out , " Friedman said . " The ammo had better hold out , " Rivera said grimly . On the river the two patrols heard Tyne 's whistle sound , faint and far away . Ward looked at his watch . Tyne was right on time . That meant five minutes before the diversion . He calculated that they were already behind the farm . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the bend they would be able to see the bridge . The river , he noted , curved almost entirely around the farm . Everywhere there was silence . They made surprisinglylittle noise as they moved ahead ; much less noise , as a matter of fact , than Ward had expected . That was good . So far things had been successful . With just a little bit of luck they might stay that way . Ward was beginning to believe that the Germanshad been so interested in the farmhouse that they had entirelyforgotten to watch the river or the bridge . That was what they got for being so interested in windows . For another thing , he did not believe that German fire coveredevery field of view from the house . He had a feeling that there were rocks up ahead , between the house and the river , and that it would have been impossible for them to cover anything in that direction . Time would show soon enough whether or not he was right . Ward wondered if he could pull the pin out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it before . " How do you feel about things , Arch ? " Tyne said to Archimbeau . They were sitting three yards from each other . Archimbeau was chewing moodily on a straw he had picked up . " It 's a long war , " Archimbeau said . " That 's all I know about it . " Still worried about Tibet ? " " Sometimes I think we 'll never get out of the Army . Honest to God , that 's what I think . " " I used to think I 'd never get in it . So I figure I 'll get out of it some day . It could be worse . " " I do n't know how , " Archimbeau said . " You do n't know . You do n't get all the stinking details . " " I 've got a stinking detail right now , " Tyne said . " Who has n't ? But what the hell . Maybe we can sleep all day tomorrow . Maybe Germany 'll surrender tomorrow . Who knows ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved up alongp133the wall , checking the men over , asking them if things were okay , making sure that everything was going to run smoothly . " Remember , " he told each one of them , " when you hear the bridge blow , get up and run like hell for the farm . " That was very important . When the Germans heard the bridge go they were going to be a very surprised group of young men , and it was necessary to take advantage of that surprise . If that went well , it was half the job . They all seemed to know that . Tyne spoke to every man of the twenty-five . As he came back to his position beside Archimbeau his stomach was screwed up in a tight knot . He felt slightly ill and slightly dizzy . It was rather hard to breathe . He knew that they were all going through the same symptoms . It was the natural thing ; it was expected . He looked at his watch . 1219 . Forty-five seconds to go , fortyfiveseconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , facing the wall . Men on either side of him were doing the same thing . He had a sudden urge to write a letter , but he did n't know to whom he wanted to write . Desperately he wanted to put words on paper , but for the life of him he could n't think of a recipient . There were so many people he would have liked to write to . Words welled up inside him . The desire to write was superseded by a desire to talk to somebody . He looked casually at Archimbeauand winked . Archimbeau winked back , his mouth twitchingas he did so . Fifteen seconds to go . The sun burned down with a radiance fiercer than ever before . I t was as though someone had flipped a switch and turned it on full power . It was a most peculiar sensation , to feel the sun grow suddenly hotter . Tyne wondered if anyone else had noticed the phenomenon . He was on the point of asking Archimbeau if he had noticed it when Rivera 's gun suddenly started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riveting machine . It sounded like the pneumatic drills Tyne had heard countless times in countless streets . And as it chattered on , the German machinegunbegan to fire , too . Good . They were looking for Rivera . That would give them time to get over the wall .   Ward heard the machine-gun and jerked his head up . They were just rounding the bend , moving very carefully . Before him he could see the bridge , a pontoon affair with about six or seven floats under it . There was no one around . They were going to get it sure as hell . Ward grinned to himself . His finger tightened around his grenade . He began to move a little faster through the water . " Fifteen , " Tyne said aloud . He stood bolt upright , blew his whistle , and leaped over the wall . Three men came over after him . As he went over the wall one of his outstretched feet struck Tinker 's body , and the body collapsed on the earth . Tyne hit the dirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had switched in his direction . It was traversing the wall . Bullets cut into the stone over his head and then passed on . The German machine-gun went silent . Either Rivera had hit it or they were changing belts . Two or three scattered rifles fired from the farm . Cautiously Tyne began to worm his way forward , over the same ground that Ward 's patrol had covered a short while before . Through the grass he could see Archimbeau workingahead . Archimbeau had perhaps two yards ' lead on him . He must have given a devil of a jump over the wall . " Damned thing 's stopped , " Friedman yelled . Rivera suddenly stopped firing . " I put enough god-damned lead in that thing to sink it , " he said . " No wonder it stopped . " " They did n't find Baby , " Friedman said . " Nope , " said Rivera . " They did n't find Baby . " He opened fire again . It was hard for a man to think as he crawled over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The farm seemed very far away . The work at hand no longer pressed on his mind . All that was automatic . What did bother him , though , was the fleeting ideas that flashed through his brain and then vanished . He found himself reviewing the whole day in snatches.  |p135He  saw Porter 's face , twisted , and Hoskins 's face , set . He saw Trasker with his jaw gone and McWilliams with his hands stretched out as though they would protect him from the plane . It seemed to him that McWilliams had been dead a very long time  --  that he had been dead for an eternity and that for eternity he was doomed to go through that same impotent action of stretching out his arms . Sometimes Tyne could not distinguish the living from the dead . Faces had a tendency to run together , to blur , to become indistinct . They became as confused and as difficult to explain as the battles they had been in . They ran togetherlike letters of ink in the rain . They had no real identity.They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so were Tyne 's thoughts . One moment he saw himself sitting by the fire at home ; the next moment he saw himself , as though from a great distance , crawling over a muddy plain . He did not recognize the landscape as a real one . He had never fought in such a place . But the landscape was familiar for all that . It was the landscape of dream . He had been moving through it for years ; he would probably never find his way out of it . The German machine-gun started up again . It was firing into the grass ahead of them now . Either the gunners were bad or they were taking their time , playing with them . Tyne looked at Archimbeau again . He was creeping doggedly ahead , his eyes fixed before him , his mouth slightly open . Tyne wondered if he were breathing through his mouth , and then he realized that he himself was . Silly . He crawled on . The patrols were nearly at the bridge . It was deserted , absolutelydeserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the approaching destruction . There was something fine about destruction ; it released something in him . Perhaps it was because , as a farmer , he had spent most of his life cultivating things , buildingthem up . It was the attraction of opposites , an outlet for severalkinds of energy . He looked forward with great glee to using his grenade . The mission was so easy that it was almost laughable . Ward had an urge to burst out in guffaws . It was all so god- damned funny . They were going to blow up a nice German bridge . It was like little boys on Hallowe'en , stealing the parson 's gate . Just like Hallowe'en . " Damned foolish thing to do , " Tyne said aloud . But he did n't know what was foolish or why he said it . He looked back at the wall and judged from his position that they were almost where Ward had been earlier . They still had a long way to go , a hell of a long way . Nothing was slower than crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to crawl around the earth ? A hundred years ? A thousand years ? He ducked as the machinegunspat over his head . He almost asked himself why they did n't depress the gun a little . It would be so easy . Ahead of him he caught sight of a body , dark against the brown grass . He thought that he had been crawling where someone had been before , but he had n't been sure ; a cow might have come through the field . The body must be Rankin . He was possessedof an intense desire to know whether or not Rankin was still alive . He very nearly rose to his feet in his haste to get to the body . Rankin was lying face down . With an effort Tyne managed to roll him over , but even as he rolled him he knew that he was dead . A dead body is completely devoid of any buoyancy . It is a mere lump . Rankin had a hole in his neck and a hole in his chest , and he had holes in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His tommy-gun lay beside him . Tyne cast an anxious glance at Archimbeau , to see that he did n't get too far ahead of him , and picked up the tommy-gun . There was blood on it , covering the notches that marked Rankin 's kills . Tyne laid his own rifle down beside Rankin and started crawling again . He took the tommy-gun with him . Flow were they making out  --  all the faces , all the bodies ? How were Cousins and Jack and MacNamara and Peterson and all the rest of them ? Did they feel the way he did ? Were they thinkingthe way he was thinking ? They had come a long way to the war , and it would be a long way back . Over their heads and be/fore their eyes the machine-gun sent its bullets in their vicious arc . It was death , alive and spitting . For all Tyne knew , some of the men had been hit already . There was no way of knowing . No way at all . Pictures flashed across his mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; the world was moving at a dizzy pace . He could not keep up with it . It was going around faster and faster . In a minute it would fly away . A dull explosion came from behind the farm . Then another and another . The bridge . Ward . And then everything that had been moving so fast stopped dead . The world stopped . Time stopped . The war stopped . The German machine-gun stopped . What had spun so fast , what had nearly hurled Tyne among the stars was stopped dead , with such a violence as to shake his body the way a woman shakes a mop from a window . His mind became clear as polished glass . Everythingin his life had led up to this moment . It was his . Nothing could take it from him . Slowly , almost gravely , he rose to his feet and blew a blast on his whistle . Men rose all around him . He saw them sharply in the shimmering air . He broke into a run . Beside him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumble with a surprised look on his face and go tumbling down like a sack , on his way to the Battle of Tibet . Tyne knew that he was running gracefully toward the farmhouse , the mysterious farmhouse , the farmhouse that was waiting to gather him in and hide him from the world . Its windows were eyes , and they were looking at him , studying his every move and the movements of the men with him . The farmhouse loomed up , and it was waiting . Behind it there were two more explosions , and somewhere in the next world Rivera 's finger was on the trigger of his gun and he was singing . They were all singing . All of them . " It is so easy , " Tyne said aloud as he ran . " It is so terribly easy . "   THE BIG PLANE pulled up from the San Francisco bay , not like a bird , but like a weight that must leave the earth . It pulled and strained , it ate the air and blew it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . The blue water held its color to the drab fuselage and then fell away , colorless and spent . Still the propellers ate on , suckingin the air , as a thirsty man gulps the water . The plane 's weight smacked against the little whitecaps , wanting freedom . And then it began to lift . The effort was gone , the force , the pull , the drag ; it was free and air-borne . Sergeant Walter Kazmierczak bent on his knees and peered out the low window . The water fell away now , deserted . It seemed entreating and secure , but the plane drove upward . The scenery dropped down , falling easily into place ; the little island , the houses far across the bay , the faint , purposeful outline of the bridge . Suddenly it receded . He was above it and away . Now all of it descended below him . Beneath him night came to San Francisco , growing wider and warmer as he left it .   Walt moved from one knee to the other , tugging at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go . That was Frisco running away , a town he had never known ; that was America disappearing , a country that suddenly , too late , he loved . America , good-bye , he thought , and then the stars came down and America was only another star , larger and more diverse : America was only a place there on the earth . Walt became embarrassed at making so much of a thing that had never been meaningful and he got to his feet . Pointedly , he straightened the strap around his waist , adjusted his tan trousers and started to sit down on his parachute pack . There were four officers sitting up near the radio cabinet , and he did n't want them to think that he was moved or uneasy about leaving his country . He did n't want them to think that he might not be a reliable gunner , so he dropped into his allottedspace and folded his arms across his chest . It felt comfortableand sufficiently oblivious , and he hoped it looked that way . He leaned back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , and he knew that outside there in the fading light night was coming down across the western coast , the same night that had covered , hours before , his home , his family , his girl , his place of life . He thought of the darkness as moving across America . The darkness that had seeped in around Virginia 's loneliness in Elmira , New York , was anotherdarkness ; the night that was coming in over San Franciscowas concealing from him his last view of his country . He fell quickly to his knees , turning as he moved , and his elbows rested on the rough canvas covering of the parachute pack . Outside the window , he could discern the long taperingwing of the plane , bent low in a banking turn , for they were crossing above the city now , turning out across the harbor , across all that must be regained . Below him the city danced in the plane 's movements . As the air hit the ship , the city rose and fell . It seemed strangep3to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes and their streets , rose and fell in a tumultuous final good-bye . Walt watched it for a while , thinking how unknown and strange it was to him , but unable to leave it . And then , readily , the plane seemed to settle on its course . It pulled out across the darkening sky ; San Francisco , California , America , settled back into the vanishing earth behind him , left now but not deserted . Walt passed his hand up through his dark , loose hair . His sallow-fair complexion stood vivid in the night light , framed by the small oblong window , and he thought , This is the time for me to know that I am going ; I am on overseas duty . Hell , I 'm a gunner now , Sergeant Walter Kazmierczak thought , but it did n't reinforce his fears . He thought of the three days he and Ginnie had had , al-'host alone , and he thought of the way she had felt urgent against him , even with the perspiration holding them together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it . It had been like that and very happily so . He tried to force himself to think , We should have been married , but the thought would not stay in his mind . He knew that Ginnie , undoubtedly still on duty at the defense plant where she stamped out the minute parts of the gun he would fire , was thinking of him , wanting more than anything in life to be flying away to his duty with him , and he , more than all he could ever gain , wanted to be secure and at rest with her . Hell , we could have been married , he thought , watching the distant city funnel itself into the darkness . But he knew that it would have taken time , it would have meant intrusions on their precious privacy , and he thought of Ginnie saying , as they walked along the dappled night street , Walt , we 'll be married after you get back . We wo n't wait , darling . ' It was not so much her acceptance , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other so rapturously , he knew , but the sure belief she had expressed that he would be back . He thought of it now , trying to reproach himself , but knowing that I-do 's are far less important than I-believe 's , for suddenly now , alone , he knew that sometime he would have to believe . He stayed by the window , watching the night go by , watching the blackness absorb the pale light of the ship and pass into blackness again . It seemed to pull him out of himself and he could not straighten to his knees . He felt overwhelminglyforlorn and deserted . He felt that there , behind him , went the thing he lived for and what lay ahead must be impermanentbecause it was as yet unreal . Everything behind him held importance , nothing ahead had value . I could get to my feet , he thought , I could sit up and talk to the others , but I do n't want to . I want to watch the night go by , I want to see the darkness spill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is no time for us to part . And then he knew he had to get up . He got to his feet as the plane hit a shallow pocket and bobbed a little beneath him . He pretended to fix his yellow jacket , though he had never had one on before , and then he dropped back into his seat . No one was watching him . No one had seen all that he had felt must be so apparent . He reached into his right breast pocket and pulled out a folded , worn mass of manila papers . These were his orders . Perhapsif they saw him looking at them now , if they saw the gleaming wings above his pockets , they would know that he was an aerial gunner heading out into the Pacific . It would establish his identity for them , for he was proud that he had been selected for a special replacement . He was going alone by air transportation . He read the orders over , studying how he was to be transported , how he was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to reach his destination . None of it gave him any feeling of being a man in love with a woman , of being a personamong people , and none of it gave him the feeling of being a soldier ready to defend his country . He started to look into his musette bag , into his pockets , P5into his orders , in hopes of finding some means of placing himself in the world : Sergeant Walter Kazmierczak , Asn 89431674 , Aerial Gunner , on his way to join a Bomber Squadron in the Pacific . There was none . What the hell am I going to do ? Mike thought , turning slowly toward the street . Beside him a thin , brown girl humped on a soapbox , her pink cotton dress stretched tightly across her legs . Her lap was filled with pale yellow plumerias and she fumblingly stabbed the sweet-smelling blossoms with a needle , forming her leis . Leis , pretty leis , ' she announced vaguely , for she was blind and not sure that someone had paused near her . Leis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger was growing in him and he did not know the cue to its gratification . He paused by an alley where a stubby , brown man in a green-flowered shirt sold cold cans of pineapple juice from the back of an old Chevrolet . Mike drank part of the sweet fluid , his eyes movingrestlessly up and down the street , and then he handed the man the can and began walking again . He tried to tell himself that he was nervous , that somewhere in an unknown part of his mind there was fear . But he knew that was n't true . He had been on missions before . He had gone to Munda and down to Rendova and Tarawa , to dozens of little atolls left burning and popping like magnesiumdropped into the Pacific . It was after these raids that the hunger had first been in him . It was something new that had grown in him , something born of battle , and he did n't know what the hell it was or how to gratify it . You 're on leave to rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shuddering catharsis , an emotional experience that would leave him drained and quiet . He looked up and down the street and did not know where to go . Without thinking , he turned back across the town , toward the whorehouses that perched along the banks of the murky canal . But halfway there , as if to stall for time , he turned into a store . The pleasant , almost forgotten odor of perfume and feminine things engulfed him , and he walked slowly through the store , glancing down at the lauhala pocketbooks , the fantasticcostume jewelry . It was strange , he thought , the nativeswent for these big wooden pins designed to look like cannibals with immense red mouths . He picked one up , looking at the crimson lips and the nose with a bone through it and then laid it down . It was both gay and gruesome . Then he crossed the aisle and stopped before the handkerchief counter . I want some of these , ' he said to the short Chinese girl behind the counter . About a half dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her lipstick vivid and luscious against her beige skin . The tingling odor of her ginger perfume came up to him as she leaned forward , counting the white handkerchiefswith the enlarged red hibiscus in them . Mike handed her a five-dollar bill and waited while she turned to wrap them . As she worked with her arms , he could see the soft roundness of her hips move beneath the chartreuse silk dress . His eyes fastened on her hips and a gentle shaking began at his shoulders and ran down to his hands , bringing a cold sweat to his palms . She turned and handed him the package with the change placed on top of it . Thank you , sergeant , ' she said , smiling . For a moment , she let him look at the bosom of her dress , a sharp awareness waiting between them , and then she turned away . Now he had something to do . He had to go to the post officeand mail the package . Mrs. Ida Sheren . He printed the name in large , crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be surprised , he thought , carrying the package to the mailing window . Indifferently the man accepted it , weighed it , stated the charge . Mike handed him the money , wanting to askP7him to take special care , to make sure it got through all right . The fellow turned and tossed the small package into a pile in the corner of the crowded room . Glancing at the posters begging for secrecy from the enemy , Mike walked out of the building . An anger was cominginto him , a sense of frustration , of being unable to achieve something he wanted . He went quickly over toward the canal , past Sad Sam 's joint , past a deserted shop , and up the dark stairs above a photographer 's shop . The rubber pads were worn on the stairs , dirt caught in the corners . Ahead of him he could see the slot in the door and knew the huge brown woman in her white apron was staring down at him . She opened the door , studying him carefully . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing her three small dollars with the name of the island printed across one side of them . The room was packed with men , waiting silently , as if they were just about to talk . Mike crossed to the far end and took his place in line . Some of the fellows glanced up at him and an older man with a pleasant red face winked mutually . Hi , sarg , ' he said . Mike nodded , wondering why the hell the man was so friendly here . The line moved slowly . Three sailors were just ahead of Mike and two of them were kidding a tall , thin boy from Kentucky . How 's the garden , Kentucky , how 's the crops ? ' one asked in heavy seriousness , loudly so others could share their fun . Got me a big crop of radishes , ' Kentucky grinned sheepishly . Yes , sir , I got me a good crop . ' Mike , listening absently , wondered how a sailor had a garden . He heard the fellows kidding Kentucky about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky 's garden was a bucket of earth he had slipped aboard . Into the small container of earth he had planted an entire package of radish seed . They need thinnin ' out , but I just ca n't do it , ' Kentucky said . I ai n't goin ' to get no radishes , but I ca n't pull any of ' em up . '   At the end of an hour , Mike had moved to the head of the line . He thought of the time the island had celebrated AppreciationWeek . That week the girls had tried to raise their price to four dollars , but the service men had considered the prices unfair and said so . Each girl worked two rooms , leaving one crib while the customer dressed and departed , to enter the adjoining one where a man was already prepared . Mike watched them ; the Japanese-American girl with the green playsuit , the tall one with the long black hair that fell onto her tan shoulders , the negress with the pretty red polkadot suit , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . He followed the big woman into the room and waited while she placed the white pitcher of water and the folded towel on the grubby stand . Three minutes , ' she mumbled . That 's all time . . . three minutes . . . pau ! ' When she had gone , Mike dropped on the edge of the bed and lit a cigarette . What am I doing here ? he thought , getting to his feet , for he hated to touch anything in the place . It 's a filthy dive . What the hell did I come here for ? He crossed to the grimy window and looked out across the town and to the distant mountains . The midday light softenedthe deep ridges , and where the sun broke through the clouds , soft splotches of green held to the mountain 's side . Three P  --  40 's were running along the rim of the mountain like birds riding the air currents . That 's where he wanted to be , Mike knew , up there in the sky where things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth , free of the . urgency of passions , released from the need of others . It was then that he felt he stood at the beginning of a passageway which led to a kind of world somehow known but unseen . He leaned against the window watching the planes climb into a chandelle and double-back on their trackless way . They sleighed down the white , uneven sky in innocent flight . You 're not even ready . ' P9Mike turned . Yeah , I 'm ready , ' he said . Shut the door . ' The young girl , thin and tired , was holding her playsuit in front of her , for she had not bothered to put it on again . She studied him defensively , but when she spoke , her voice had no resistance in it . I do n't do anything special . ' I do n't want anything , special or otherwise , ' Mike said . Have a cigarette ? ' The girl seemed suddenly embarrassed . His attitude , combiningrejection and sympathy , confused her . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged the blue playsuit against her front . This is a hell of a place to come for a visit , ' she commented evasively . Forget it . ' Do n't you like me ? ' she asked , forcing a playful , pleading note into her childish voice . You 're my everything , ' Mike said , and then , like a quotationmark after the statement , he grinned his wide Irish grin . Go ahead , relax , take a break . ' The girl took the cigarette and dropped onto the edge of the bed . She no longer tried to cover herself , but dropped the suit across her legs and looked at Mike . One of us is slippin ' , ' she said , taking a deep drag . It 's me , girlie , ' Mike said . She was young , much younger than she should be , and when he spoke it was at her , for he knew she would n't understand . I 'm hungry , but I do n't know what for . ' You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , trying to smile . Hell , it 's not that . It 's something in my mind , something I got to have . ' The girl tapped her cigarette and watched the gray ashes float down onto the green linoleum . Then she blew at them , fiercely , as if she hated seeing them there . I used to have it . It was like something that was supposed to be mine , but I did n't know what it was . But I screwed up . Boy , did I screw up ! '   I 'll get along . ' The girl ran her pudgy hand back through her yellow hair and held it against her head . Except for the large red glass ring that looked like a drop of blood above her forehead , she seemed eager . I got a car and gas , too , ' she said . I 'm goin ' to knock off at one o'clock . ' Well , have a good time . ' The red droplet passed slowly down the side of her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up , holding her playsuit in front of her and started for the door . The time of my life , sergeant , ' she said , and , at the door , she turned and looked at him , the lids of her eyes drawn down slightly . Kill a couple for me . Kill the whole god-damned bunch ! ' she said wearily , and stepped out of the room . Mike dropped his cigarette on the green-checked linoleum , twisted his heavy shoe on it and started for the door . Down the stairs and into the street he carried with him the mixed odors of human exposure and spicy perfume . It was noon now and the bars were open , open and crowded . Mike walked down to the corner and climbed into a taxi . A moment later a fat tan girl , carrying a stick with some kind of barbecued meat spitted on it , crawled into the front seat . Where go ? ' she mumbled . Mike gave her the name of a bar on the edge of town . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reddishbrownmeat and muttering at the heavy traffic . The bar was built like a huge outrigger canoe , but you could n't stand there . You had to sit at a table . Most of them were crowded , but there was one in the center of the sprawlingpatio where two guys hunched over tall , pinkish drinks . Mike started toward them , noticing that they wore the infantryblue braid on their caps . All right ? ' he asked , pulling the chair out from the table . Sure , ' the guys said . What the hell you guys drinkin ' ? ' Zombies . There 's pink ones and green ones . Which color of death do you want ? ' P11What 's the difference ? ' The heavier soldier , his face beaded with sweat , held up his glass . This has got grenadine in it . Them green ones has cream de mint , or some kind of crap in them . Anyway , it kills the taste of the local brew . ' A short , plump girl , her lips heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , came over to the table . Give us three of these things , ' Mike said . He laid five dollars on the table . The other fellows had some bills stacked in front of them . They were just back from jungle maneuvers , they told Mike , and their pocketbooks were stiff and their thirst monumental and urgent . I 'm goin ' to drink these things until I float right out through them damned bushes , ' the Italian corporal said , pointing to the purple-splotched croton bushes that bordered the tables . Here 's to the infantry , ' Mike said when the waitress slopped the drinks onto the table . The fellows picked up their glasses , pleased and intently friendly . Here 's to the air forces . ' How much pass you got ? ' Twenty-four hours . Tomorrow morning at nine . ' The heavy fellow wiped the sweat from his face and looked around at the crowd , thinking of the years when he had been a subwaydispatcher in New York . It pleased him to be in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded space . One whole side was packed with infantrymen , their faces tanned and looking as if they had just been scrubbed with a brush . We 're gettin ' up a CP right here ! ' he announcedhappily . At noon the palm trees threw down star shadows , evenly formed , but gradually the shadows became lopsided and sent long fingers out across the tan uniforms and across the white uniforms of the sailors , young and quiet , who talked of their li tends in high school . It did not seem that the liquor would ever take hold . They looked at the drinks , mistrusting them , but finally their musclesbegan to release their tension , the bottoms of their feet tingled restfully . A lot of noise slipped out into the yellow air and was replaced by a song of fellows enjoying themselves . Sailors and marines passed the table , smiling friendly ' hiyas . ' They all looked at each other in a sort of mutual appreciationand understanding , and the warm tropical wind blew in , rattling the palm fronds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They took out their wallets and pulled from them pictures of their girls , and their families , and their buddies in Africa and Italy , in Kiska and Iceland and India and Christmas Island . They told each other of the camps they had been in , which was chicken and which was swell . They made elaborate bets on when the thing would be over , and then , deciding there was no way for a soldier to know , they took up their glasses again . Goddamn , I 'd like to get to China , ' the corporal said , for none of them thought of ever getting home until the war was over . It took about a year overseas to get the idea in your head , Mike knew , but once you accepted it , it made the war a part of your life and you a part of it . That was why it was so important and why you had to learn something from it . You guys have it rugged , ' Mike said , thinking that a man could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself held no measure of growth . The heavy guy struck the Italian corporal on the shoulder with the butt of his broad hand , jarring the boy . They both laughed , just a little as if the joke was on them . It 's not so tough . We got us a good bunch of joes . ' They looked about at the fellows they had been with for two years ; two years of drilling , of maneuvers in Louisiana and maneuvers in the jungle , of digging foxholes and crawling in for the night , of catching rain in their helmets when there was rain . They thought of the seventy-nine-mile hike they had just finished . They had just finished it the day before . It was closest to them , the thing they remembered best . What happened ap13year ago could hardly be recalled and it was n't important anyway . It was gone like so many other things . Mike watched them . He knew there was a strong camaraderieamong them . It was a physical thing , something that came from hand-to-hand combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't like that with him , Mike knew . The old HeartlessHarpie carried her full crew , but it was only a handful of men ; men who fought and lived inside the Harpie 's warm fuselage . But there was something that happened up there , far from the earth , that did not happen elsewhere . It might happen beneath the earth and under the seas , Mike thought , slipping a piece of ice into his mouth and back into the glass . It might happen in the quiet and alien places where death waited , but he could not be sure . He only knew the limitless ranges that fanned upward from the earth , and they had given him this curious craving . Let 's get stinkin ' , ' he said . You ai n't just whistlin ' , bud , ' the dark-haired corporal said . The heavy man loosened his collar and ran his finger around its wet edge . We got to keep an eye on our buds , ' he said . When they get high , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ' We 'll keep an eye on them , ' Mike said , and then he looked up at the palms . There was a soft rattling among them . Liquid sunshine , ' the corporal said as the thin rain came down and spotted their uniforms . Liquid to liquid returneth ! ' he took a long drink , and threw his face back in the warm rain and laughed . This is more like it , Mike thought . He lifted his glass toward them and they smiled happily . It was like something out of their childhood , a pleasure forgotten . A sudden , deep excitement ran around the tables and they began to sing.  | THE HEARTLESS HARPIE SQUATTED SECURE in her bunker like a great animal come to rest . Tech SergeantChester Poniatowski knelt down on the ground in front of her . They looked as if they were standing guard over each other . He turned , there on the burned-out grass , watching some P  --  40 's take off . Almost disinterestedly , he watched them climb up the dark gullies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trees until they lost themselves in the dark shadows . He waited , knowing that in a moment they would reappear at the brim of the mountain , suddenly black and fast against the orange rays of the sunset . Pon leaned back against the sparse grass and studied the peaked outline of the mountain . When the planes broke separately against the light , he saw them bank and turn . They leveled off and sped down the silhouette of the ridge and off toward the sea . Only then did he roll over on his back and look up at the Harpie . It was good to see her there , primed and ready . She was n't sleek and quick like a fighter or pursuit . She was big and awkward on the ground , but he loved her . He liked to look at her , sensing her immense power , the tremendous force that rested inside her . He liked to go about her , touching her and taking care of her . He walked slowly back beside the ship , running his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned against her side and looked across the red dusty field . This was the best damned life in the world , he told himself . He was alone with the Harpie , the way he used to be alone with his Plymouthand there was no feeling like it . People had alwaysp15been amazed that he had been able to make the old jalopy run . How the hell do you do it , Pon ? they 'd ask . He wonderedproudly what they would think now if they could see the Harpie . At the rear of the plane , he reached up and shoved one sectionof the split tail around a little , listening to the faint protest , and then he stooped under her and pulled himself up through her open belly . Inside her the air was still warm and it held its metallic , oily odor . He stood for a moment on the narrow catwalk that crossed the bomb-bay and in the dull light he could see the glint of all her parts . He liked the way the neat wires ran down her sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , the slick bomb-racks . Two fat auxiliary gas tanks rested in the forward bomb-bay . Everything was checked and perfect . The Harpie was ready to go out . He knew that it was silly as hell , but often , when he was alone with her like this , he sensed that she was grateful to him . It was something he imagined , he admitted , but he had worked with enginesall his life and he knew how they reacted ; an engine was a thing you could depend on . He walked slowly up the catwalk , stepped through the bulkhead and up the flight deck . He leaned against the small navigator 's table and looked up into the plexiglass turret . The light was changing quickly , and he moved on up to the pilot 's seat . He sat down , his feet finding the heavy bar , and he shoved it about a little , just to get the feel of it . He took a cloth from the shin-pocket of his green fatigues and wiped the dials , dusted off the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seat , the cloth held idly in his stained hand , and let his eyes run out her left wing . It was long and broad , but it was graceful . It would hold up a weight that was hard to believe , yet it looked flexible , it looked like a thing that could move . He looked at the wing , thinking of the times he had waited for her to come back from her missions . That was in the days before he had his gunner 's training , when he was a mechanic . He remembered how he strained his eyes searching for wounds , but it was n't that he was waiting for . He was waiting to see if she roared down to brush the field , screaming out her success . It was then that she was most alive . It was then that she was a proud and great ship and held a man 's love . The waiting had become unbearable . He would pace the field , telling himself that he might never see the Harpie again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finished , they made him engineer and waist gunner , and now he told himself that there would never be any reason for him to be separatedfrom her . The orange in the sky had faded to pink and now it was turning pale lavender and blue . Streamers of white clouds became gray-black in the light and night was crawling up the mountain . Pon leaned back in complete contentment . He and his Harpie were ready . Well , old girl , we 're goin ' out tomorrow , ' he said easily . The Harpie held him in her quietness . It was this that he liked most . He was n't made for war and he knew it . In his hands an Ml rifle with a bayonet on the end of it would be as futile and useless as a broomstick . He was an engineer and he would keep his ship going as long as there was enough of her left to put his hands on . He would keep her ready to go out and fix her when they returned . That was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never make a combat soldier . He had becomea gunner only so that he could stay with his ship . Sometimes he told himself that the Harpie understood this . He hoped she did , for no one else knew it . He could almost see the darkness creep out from the foot of the mountain and start across the field toward them . He 'd have to get up to the barracks before long and clean up and hit the sack . He would leave a call for three instead of three-thirty . He 'd tell the CQ to get him up at three , he decided , for that would allow him time to give her a little special attention . P17Pon leaned back in the pilot 's seat , feeling that he was sitting on top of the ship 's head . It was the way she held her nose up that gave him the proud feeling . You 're a proud old girl , are n't you ? ' he asked , scooting down in the seat . He wondered how it was back home . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting ready to go off to bed . They got up early , too , so they did n't waste many evenings sitting around the kitchen . One pipeful of tobacco usually lasted the time it took to get the dishes done . You all finished up there , Sarah ? ' his dad would say from the rocking-chairby the kitchen window , for he had never known his father to go to bed without his mother . Got your fires fixed ? ' I 'm goin ' to do it now . ' It was good , thinking of them like that . He hoped nothing would ever change the way they lived . Their work ended in sleep and began from sleep ; he knew how unbearably lonely one would be if the other went to rest first . They asked so little of life and so pitifully little of death , but you could n't plan on a thing like that . You did n't even think of it much , especially when you had the feeling that you 'd never see them again . The darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights were coming on . He hoped the new gunner got in on time . Somewhere above him he could hear the P  --  40 's whirling down the sky . The guys were having a good time up there tearing around . It reminded him of the times he had been out tinkering with his jalopy when the Chicago plane went across . He would twist his head and listen to her engines , watching the green and red lights move straight down the night . He had thought that he would like to work on one of them some day . But he had planned on doing it . at the Chicago Airport , not inside a clay bunker , covered with a camouflage net , somewhere in the Pacific .   It was dark inside the Harpie now , but he walked back easily and dropped down through the bomb-bay and onto the clay earth . Beneath the wing and down along the side of the mat , he saw the dimmed lights of a jeep approaching and knew the guards were being put out . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling darkness . I hope he 's got enough sense to keep his eyes open . ' The jeep whirled across before the ship and stopped . A black watchdog on the rear seat barked loudly and a soldier , holding his rifle out in the air , leaped to the ground . Want a ride , Pon ? ' the corporal of the guard shouted . He slumped behind the wheel , his left foot stuck up against the edge of the windshield . Step on it . ' Go ahead , I 'll walk back , ' Pon called . Okay . ' The jeep pulled away and raced down the side of the mat . Christ , it 's dark out here ! ' the soldier said , walking toward Pon . Who the hell do they think is goin ' to steal this thing anyway ? ' Pixies , ' Pon said . I thought they were on our side . ' He stopped close to Pon and in the last straggling light , Pon saw the boy 's young face , framed by the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , ' Pon said . Do I have to feed and water this thing , or will it go to sleep ? ' She 'll sleep , ' Pon answered , grinning . It 's a hell of a way to fight a war . My friends think I 'm a soldier . ' He dropped the butt of his rifle to the ground and leaned on it . I hope she do n't create any disorders , for I 'll be damned if I can call the corporal of the guard from here . ' Do n't you go tinkering with anything inside her , ' Pon said , . starting off toward the runway . Listen , mac , General Eisenhower with an order from the President could n't get me in one of them things . ' Do n't allow anyone near her . '  |p19Tell  the corporal of the guard not to forget that I 'm out here , ' the soldier yelled . Okay . Relax . ' Pon walked slowly across the runway and up around the clay bunkers , his feet sliding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searchlights were bisecting the sky , diverging , forming a peak to which all of them pointed and in the glowing apex a plane was caught , its wings and fuselage silver as it turned and struggled like a trapped bird . Pon paused and looked back toward the darkness that held the Harpie . Tomorrow , girlie , we 'll be taking off , ' he said softly . This will be it , ' he added , without knowing why . SERGEANT FRANK NORRIS SAT QUIETLY STAR  --  ing at the bush . It was silly for a bush to have so many different-coloredleaves , he thought . The damned Snow Bush had white and pink and green , and all possible mixtures , on it . I t looked as if it could n't make up its mind , or as if Nature had had a lot of odds and ends left over and flung them down here beside the thin porch of the First Three Graders Club . And as if that was n't enough , a Firecracker vine had to go chasing around through the bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Gook girls called it a Huapala vine and that it meant sweethearts . He wondered idly if the Firecracker had made them think of sweethearts , or whether it was the other way around . It beats me , he thought , and let his eyes fall down to the ground and the twelve bottles of beer concealed in the shade . They were warm now and each one wore a small crown of foam . The seedy , white foam leaned over to one side of the bottle like the fine feathered hat of some Masonicclub member . All good club members , Norry mumbled . Hey , Norry , we 'd better take a reading on the brew situation , ' Sergeant John Curtin suggested . It 's a deal , ' Norry admitted , getting to his feet . Come on , Walt . ' Sure , ' Walter Kazmierczak answered , grinning , for he wanted the fellows to like him ; he was going to be with them a long time , the way he had never been with anyone before . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his bright new wings above his pocket , for all the others wore soiled and sloppy green fatigues . They did n't bother to zip up the sides of the legs and Norry had the front of his unzipped down below his navel . As he moved , his dog tags slid loosely against the sparse hair of his chest . The green fatigues , when the fellows moved , seemed to sort of hang on for the ride . They all wore soft leather slippers and Walt wondered where they had got them . As he stood up , he turned to see if SergeantWashington , their armament man , was coming . Cowin ' , ' Chief said , wiping his palm across the top of the bottle . He always did that before he took a drink . Quickly he tossed a slug of the warm beer down his throat and then set the half-empty bottle back among the nest of twelve . It 's not bad if you do n't let it remind you of anything , ' he grinned . They crossed the larger room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Gook boy was unsnapping beer bottles with both hands . He set them on the wet counter in pairs , for a guy was only allowed two bottles at a time . Give us eight of them , ' Norry said , planking the money down in the sticky , drying beer suds . Eight of them . Good kind . ' All good kind , ' the boy said and laughed shrilly He leaned over and dug into the bottom of the battered CocaColacontainer . Beer all pau , all gone , ' he said , laughing again . This last beer . All pau . ' The fellows grabbed up their beer and walked single fileP21back onto the porch . It was a routine a man went through to get his brew , and since these were the last they would have for a while , they were resentfully grim and silent on their last trip . What is to become of us ? ' Johnny said , holding the bottles up to the fading light . And then he laughed . Sit down and have some Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cache beneath the Snow Bush . The guy that shipped this stuff over here ought to be shot . You 'd think they 'd at least take out the deodorant . ' Labor shortage , ' Johnny said . We all got to give up some-thing . ' Chief wiped his hand across the bottle . His cap was turned sidewise on his black hair and the long , square-brimmed visor stuck up above his right ear . This is the second time this stuff has been down a hatch . ' Shut up , you , ' Norry laughed . It ai n't legal for Indians to drink . ' Boy , you call this drinkin ' ? ' Chief asked , and his round face was suddenly broken by his wide grin . When we get down below we 'll be drinkin ' Stomp Juice and Torpedo Junction Cocktails . That stuff is wicked . ' Hey , Walt , how is it back in the States ? ' Johnny asked . I do n't know . It 's all right . ' What about that ration crap ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at the others . There was a curious eagerness in his voice as if something was happening to his home which he did not understand . He looked at Norry and the Chief , for none of them had been back in a long time and they were curious about changes that had been made where they wanted things to remain permanent and unchanged . It must be rugged , ' he finished , saying it as a question . Walt tried to explain some of the changes to them . He knew that they were deeply concerned for their families , the ones they loved ; they did not want them to have hardships . One bunch of hardships was enough , as far as they were concerned , and they did not want anyone messing with the things they were fighting for . Those things were to remain exactly as they were , for it was the way a man had to have them . You carried a picture with you all the time and when you went in for a run , when the Zeros were coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to have to think that the picture was wrong . It was a time when you wanted to be sure the things you were fighting for were still there , defined and lasting . You get used to it , ' Walt told them . None of the fellows spoke . They took slow , alternate drags on their beer and their cigarettes . Norry thought of the changes that must have come into Fairmont , West Virginia . He thought of his mother around four in the afternoon . She always took a bath just before she went down to the corner store for the supper groceries . He could see her walking along in the spotted shade of the silver poplars , her brown pocketbook under her arm and her hair still wet around the edges from her bath . He liked to see her then , with the comb marks in her hair , neat and clean above her ears . She seemed so happy and content , as if getting supperfor her family was all that lay ahead of her . His mother always snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the front walk and carried it to the store with her . She carried it in her free hand and lightly whipped the side of her dress with it , and in the store she would lay it on the counter by the white roll of wrapping paper as she picked up her groceries . She must have left ten thousand of them there , Norry thought , remembering that , from the time his eyes barely reached the top of the chipped counter until the last day when she had bought the chicken and celery and the first bottle of black olives Mr. Clark had sold in months , she had almost invariably left the little twig . He often thought she liked to carry them each day to remind herself , with the pale buds , the green leaves , the frost-purple ones , the cold icy stems , that life was passing and that each day there was this good fullnessof wife and mother for which she could be grateful . But now he wondered if she carried them or if the urgency of ra-P23tioning , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season 's passing by the numbers on her ration slips . Like the others , he could not visualize it . He remembered reading of it happening in Europe years before , but it was always happeningsomewhere in Europe and the stories brought with them a vision of a starving line of people blocks long . He would n't think about it that way , he told himself . It did n't make any difference what happened to him , he was going right on thinking that his mother was walking down Mulberry Street with a twig of hedge in her hand , wondering what the men would like for supper . You ever see a guy go for beer like Bob ? ' Johnny said , reaching under the bush for a bottle . He blew the drying foam off and quickly took a swig of it . There was a real beer man , ' Chief said . Walt started to ask them who Bob was , but hesitated . He had met so many guys in the mumble of checking in that he was afraid he had missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harpie 's crew , or if by Bob they meant Captain Lawler , their pilot , or Lieutenant Watts , the copilot , but he did n't want to ask . The outfit was n't very G.I. He had to admit that . He had reported to Captain Lawler at the operations shack , giving him a fine salute and announcing himself as reportingin for duty . Captain Lawler had said something about glad-you-got-here-okay and then he had turned and shouted out the window . Hey , Chief , here 's our new belly gunner . Get him a fart sack ! ' It was n't at all the way it was done back in the States , nor the way the handbook prescribed , so Walt decided to keep his mouth shut until he had caught onto enough ropes to pull himself upright . Chief , you think they 're rationing corn to the Indians ? ' They 're probably rationing Indians , ' Chief grinned . Them Choctaws are hittin ' the trail , probably , ' Norrysaid , pouring the last of the beer foam from his bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Lincoln Highway . ' Chief wiped the whitish palm of his brown hand across the top of a bottle and then took a drag on it . It was warm and tasted as if it had corn syrup in it . It tasted as if it had somethingof fall in it when the sage turned pale green , almost colorless , and the leaves of the quaking aspens glimmered yellow in the late evening . It was then when the pine nuts were ripe and the cool , first sneeze of winter rushed down from the western mountains that you felt the wonder of being a part of a country . On days like that , he remembered , he and the other fellows would slip from school in the late afternoon and race up the dust-soft road for a mile or more , up toward the deep canyons . They would gather whatever wood they could find , some sage and mesquite , pile it in the road and burn it . When the blazes leaped up , they would squat beside the fire and stare at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he would never stop being amazed and pleased with fire . He liked the color of it , the warmth , the threat it held . It was a strange thing to show up in the world . It held power and destruction , it cured and it killed . It was made up of elements brought together explosively and they could talk about all the floods they wanted to , you had a feeling that at sometime there had been one hell of an explosion and out of it , spitting fire and brimstone , came the earth . You could n't live around the desert without knowing that . Water and fire and earth ; those things his people had alwaysknown and only one of them was permanent and unchangeable , so they knew the earth best . They knew how to live with it . They appreciated and decorated it as they would a pair of shoes . The old peoples , the peoples who had been with the earth for unrecorded centuries , were the ones with the pretty shoes . He smiled , thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft leather , beaded moccasins she had always worn . The chain-store shoes were fine for the transients , but she wanted something pretty to place on the ground as she walked . He knew it would n't make much difference how rationingp25hit his family . They would manage to eat somehow , or go hungry silently . His people had never been tradespeople , but they had been taught to turn the things they loved into a trade . Their beautiful silver , blankets , their earthen pottery , their moccasins and beaded belts ; those things had become their trade , sold on the highways to passing Americans . He knew that there were n't many passing now and that things must be getting tough , but when his sister wrote for his parents , she did not mention it . She told him of her school , of the things she was learning , of their pride in him . And she wrote that any morning now they would awaken to find the land in bloom . His country , the country around Waynoka , Oklahoma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many times his people had talked of it . The older men , the men who had fought for the land they loved , had seen that violent blooming . I t had happened on a spring morning , an April morning in 1889 . There had been stories that such a terrible flowering might come , but they had not believed it . They had stood staring as the mountainous dust-flower billowed and rolled toward them . One hundred thousand strangers were stampedinginto the heart of the Indian country . Wherever they stopped they could cry This land is mine , ' and no one could tell them , No , we have lived here many , many years . ' It was an ill-nurtured flower that ripened and burst its seed upon them , smothering them . But in the end , Chief thought , the Choctaws had given the state its name . Two Indian words had been combined and their meaning was Red People . But they did not give Oklahomaits motto , they had n't the wit . Labor conquers all things . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his eyes as some P  --  40 's chased down the brim of the distant mountain . They cut across the sky that was turning to a pale blue , letting the night force it upward . He set his bottle of beer down on the edge of the porch , for he did not want any more . He looked at the darkening sky and said to himself , Ginnie , you 're one hell of a long ways away tonight . They drank and smoked slowly , knowing there would be no more evenings like this . They were going back again to the places where time was counted only by the hours a man was yet alive . They were returning to the places where all life seemed governed by the sounds that pounded into their ears . Norry went inside and came back with a dozen sandwiches held insecurely between two paper plates . Here 's some grub to eat while we pack , ' he said . I hope Mike 's back . We got to sign for some new equipment . ' He 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned radio man in the army . ' Marconi number two , ' Chief said , placing his empty bottle with the others . Boy , five more PX beers and I could float back to that shack . ' They fell into a single line , walking carefully along the dark edges of the slit trenches , beneath the palm trees , around a gun emplacement and down toward the shack . I hope I see that son of a bitch with the gold teeth , ' Johnny said quietly in the dark . It was the first mention they had made of what lay ahead . That 's the bastard I want . ' For a moment there was no comment . The night was silent but for the P  --  40 's roaring along in the pale light at the top of the sky . Ahead on the mat , a jeep sped along , deliveringthe guard . Who 's the guy with the teeth ? ' Walt asked from the rear of the line . The fellows seemed to hesitate , almost as if they were unwilling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves . Chief stopped and lit a cigarette . The light was unexpectedlyvivid in the night . He 's the guy that got Bob . ' Walt felt a curious quietness about himself . He was going to take Bob 's place.  |p27HOLDING  HER LEFT WHEEL , THE HARPIE swung her right about like a dancer doing a pivot . Her great body swung around easily and faced down the long runway . The soft rain of the night still glistened on her wings , on the twin surfaces of her tail and one by one the four engines roared , testing themselves , and then she settled back . Lieutenant Watts peered back through the flight deck at the men , holding his thumb and forefinger together to form a loop . He grinned at them . With a wild , anxious snort the Harpie began to roll . She moved easily , gathering speed , but unhurriedly . She rolled along , seemingly getting lighter . She lifted her tail , took the strain from her wheels , let her nose pull up slightly , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving to them . The crew looked at them a moment and then turned inside the ship . The earth was below them now and no longer of interest . Inside the Harpie there was a slow grinding noise as the landing gear retracted . Jerry Lawler let her ride , gaining height , until he could feel the air currents bouncing back from the mountains and smacking against the wings . He lowered his right wing , banked slowly and pulled down parallel with the ridge until it dropped from sight beneath them , and nothinglay ahead but the soft blue water of the Pacific and the distant clouds that came down and seemed to melt into it . Jerry looked across at Watts and grinned , winking . But it was n't a humorous passing sort of intimacy . It was an expression of mutual knowledge . It was a recognition of each other and what must be shared . Watts winked back , but there was something in the slight , purposeful hesitancy that caused Jerry to turn quickly to checking his instruments . I ca n't expect him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are alike and there is n't any Bill . Besides , he told himself , if Watts encroached on the gestures Bill had used , the way he slumped in his seat apparently oblivious but aware with every sense he held , he would resent it deeply . No , Bill was gone and this was a new copilot sitting beside him . They were on their way out and only the two of them knew now that it would be a long time before they came back . After a while , after six or eight hours when the fellows became anxious , he 'd turn her over to Watts and go back and tell them that they were on their way . The Harpie would n't be returning to the old field . They were going to an advance base and from there , well , they were going on out and , one way or the other , they would stay there . The big blow was being made in the South Pacific and they were in on it . The Harpie was pulling a little heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her gas weighed on her , waiting to feed her , and the huge bombs in her racks made her stomach heavy . But she was on her way and she seemed to know it . The Harpie would n't have it any other way , he told himself . Not any more than he would . It seemed improbable that during the last days of his furloughhe had been impatient and fretful . It was hard to think of it as so , for those last five days had been the only days of his honeymoon . Betts had said she understood , she had tried desperately to see how it was with him , but there was no way of being sure . The things he believed he felt so profoundly that they excluded almost everything else . He glanced again at Watts  --  Wattsy he called himself  --  seeing the copilot 's rounded nose , the full red lips , the deep shadow of his beard that ran down along his jawbone and discoloredhis neck . He looked at him and thought of Bill and Midway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war had been new to them . We had one hell of a time , Bill , did n't we ? he thought . We did what we could . We learned . The Harpie 's window was n't cracked now as it had been in that one dreadful moment , but Jerry knew that the shattering would always be ahead of him for him to see . It would never leave him . It was like something that happened to you as you came into manhood , a thing that was unfailingly vivid . In the days when Bill had been sweating out the birth of his child , they had had that to think about . They could n't talk much , except in a kind of half-sign language that defeatedthe noise , but they both knew . It became more and more important each day because there was no mail coming through , and they could never be certain if the child was born yet or not . Once in a while Bill would turn , hitching his thumbs in his armpits and wiggling his fingers and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission , Bill 's kid was alive and real there in the cockpit with them . They actually patted the kid and fussed with it and rode it along in the Harpie , yanking the ship around when she took the wind too hard . They rode him along through the sky , thinking how goddamnedswell it was suddenly to have a child born of you . Other times Bill would hold his hands free in the air , indicating that Jerry should take her over and then he would slump down . His eyes would close slightly , almost defiantly , as if the knowledge was out ahead of them somewhere but not yet attainable . It was on one of those days when they had ridden for hour after hour , fighting to get the crippled Harpie back , when the engines jerked away as if they were fed on uneven air , that Jerry had looked over at Bill and knew that he was praying . He looked at Bill and knew that he was praying to the Holy Christ , wherever He was , to help out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any longer and finally his face relaxed , his eyes opened , and he rested . They did n't ride the kid around much after that for he was n't theirs to create as he had been .   And then on a Thursday , the Thursday of the second week of the New Guinea campaign , the Colonel came out to the mat and told Bill that the War Department had managed to get a message through : Lieutenant William Moore of Charlottesville , Virginia , was the father of a six-pound girl . It was funny how having a kid that was a boy made you feel proud , but having one that was a girl made you feel as if something special had been brought to order . It made you feel as if you had been chosen because you were the kind of guy who would make a good father for a girl to have . There was a bigger sense of responsibility involved and you began to think about how you had a job that was going to take a particularkind of understanding , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said Wife and daughter fine , ' and there was n't a great deal you could do but go ahead with your work , trying to kill the enemy before they got you . After three weeks of that , Bill always turned the Harpie over to Jerry after they made their run and let him bring her home . He tried to apologize for it but Jerry would n't let him . After all , if a guy has a family , which is a very different thing from having a young wife , you could n't do him out of the chance to slip down in the corner of his seat and thank the Lord for pullingyou through another tough spot . He knew Bill so well that he could practically see what was going on in his mind . Bill would think about his wife standing over the kid and using the very softest tips of fingers to brush at the baby 's damp , blond hair , and the baby was asleep with the milk still moist on its lips . He would think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name for he did n't know what it was yet . He would think of it for a long while and when it got to hurt too much , he would let out a deep , agonized groan and then the defiance would come and go , and Bill would stare away over to the right and say , Jesus , what can a guy do ? ' It was a very sound and direct question and usually he got some kind of an answer . Enough to hold him until another mission . P31So in a way , Jerry knew , the kid was born there with them . We certainly sweated her out , Bill , he thought , looking at the gray rain coming up from the southwest , watching it approachthem like a soft , uneven curtain . Watts leaned toward him . Does n't look too bad . ' Jerry glanced at the rain and then made a dismissing , spittingmovement of his lips . It was n't Bill 's low for his wife and daughter that made it so tough . It worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the kid or even to learn her name and that made it plenty tough , but at least he knew there was one . It was the way it had been in the last moments that Jerry knew he would never forget . The Zero bore in on them , afire and a piece of one wing flying off , but it kept on coming until its guns splintered the plexiglass like spring ice . The blood suddenlyspurted down Bill 's forehead and he slumped forward in a hideously grotesque apology . It was n't fair to Bill that he had to go out that way , as if he had done something wrong . Jerry had wanted to tell Betts about it , but he could n't say i t right . Even on their honeymoon when they clung to one another with uncontrolled anticipation , even when they almostcried out in their desire to melt themselves into a oneness , indivisible , the words would not come to him . It angered him , for his release was not complete , and it was unfair to Betts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she looked at him , unashamedly begging for a chance to share this alien knowledge that was growing in him . He wanted to say , Betts , there 's something happening to us , somethinggreater than ourselves , but he knew that he might just as well say that he wanted to stand on his head at the bottom of the sea . It would make about as much sense . Happy , Jerry ? ' she whispered softly , holding his cigarette between her fingers so that he could smoke and hug her to his chest at the same time . Do I make you happy , Jerry ? ' It hurt then , it hurt like a son of a bitch . He put his arms tightly around her and his legs and hugged her , but the things he wanted to say would not shape themselves . They would go around and around on the edge of his mind , and when a phrase came it seemed a detached part of a thought he had had a long time ago . Not all of them added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Betts rubbed her free hand across his forehead , pushing his damp hair back , and it seemed that the gesture was full of sympathy . It seemed that she was feeling sorry for him for what he had been through , and he resented it deeply . It caused him to withdraw into himself , he knew , and a dark look of hurt came across Betts ' face . Darling , do n't , ' he pleaded , pulling her face deep into his throat , and then their desire , their overwhelming hope of beingforever inseparable when their days together could be counted on a hand , caused them to cling to one another , tearfullyhappy for a sort of joy they gave one another . The days had passed like that . And then at the station , when she kissed him good-bye for the last time , she reached up her hand , unseen until he felt it , and passed her soft fingers lightly across his forehead . He pulled away , looking at her as if the knowledgestood between them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beloved , ' she said softly . Now , as the rain closed around them , singing shrilly on the wings of the Harpie , Jerry repeated the word to himself . I t was a strange word , one that she had never used before . Of all the terms of endearment , this they had never used between them . He repeated the word slowly , rocking it in the revolvingroar of the engines , and he remembered the touch of her hand . It was like the beginning of a sentence ; a knowledge of things the words of which could not be formed . Beloved , beloved : she knew , Jerry realized , she did n't understand , but she knew . He turned from it , as if the thought bore some knowledge he did not want yet . He glanced quickly back through the catwalk . P33Pon was standing in the center of the flight deck , his hand resting on the edge of the top turret . Jerry stuck out his right fist , thumb extended and made the familiar up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting . Of all the men who had berthed in the Harpie since she was first air-borne , they alone were left . Jerry swung his eyes back to the front , preparing to pull the Harpie up over the storm , and he hoped that Pon wouldways be with them . There was something about the silent , ever-present Pon that took the pressure off . There was something about the Harpie that made her more than a battling Old bag of bolts . The Harpie had a spirit about her that could not be assailed even by death . WHEN THE HARPIE REACHED THE TOP OFhe rain , two other ships were waiting for her . They came in one at a time , like workmen gathering along the road , and roared down the sky . There were no markers for time or space , but they met as easily as if they had traveled this way a thousand times . The fellows watched them , knowing they had a date down over the horizon , and it was going to be an important one . Jerry called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t t le down for a long ride . Roger , ' Johnny Curtin replied easily . A deep sense of excitementcame over him , but he continued to work around his 50-caliber . He knew every inch of her , knew the texture and feel of each piece , and as he stood there rubbing the lock with his bare hand , he glanced at the B  --  24 riding down the opposite side of the formation . The Heavenly Body was a good ship to watch . She seemed to frolic in the air ; she was skittish like a colt . It was just a feeling you got , watching her . Though he had over two hundred hours , combat hours , as a waist gunner , Johnny was still uncertain what it was that caused him to be here . He had asked for it . He wanted to be a gunner , but he did n't know why . He stared into the fleecy clouds , remembering the afternoon he had been driving the two new Plymouths from Michigan down to Marion , Ohio . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sweet side ; a good job , plenty of money and women and if the boss got too cranky he could tell him to go blow it . The last summer sun had been hot on the highway , and the paper on the fenders to protect the paint job ripped loose and flapped monotonously . He rode along slowly , the sun hot on his bent arm , the dance music coming sweet and blue from the Detroit station . He was thinking he 'd get to Marion in plenty of time to clean up and beat it out to Red 's place , two miles south of town . Pete had said they had a couple of new janes out there and one of them was a blonde from New Jersey . And then the music had stopped and in the quiet sunny afternoon a voice had come in clear and sharp . France had fallen ! France was gone ! Hitler was marching his men through the shadow of the Eiffel Tower . I 'll join up tomorrow , Johnny told himself and even yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out loud , there on the highway in Ohio , and he put his foot down on the gas pedal and the Plymouth hooked on behind jerked a little as he picked up speed . I 'll get down there in the morning and sign up . I 'll get stinkin ' tonight and tomorrow I 'll join the army . ' All the way into Marion , he kept wondering why the hell he was going to enlist , for his mind was made up . There was n't any answer to it . Not one that made sense . WhatP35Terence did it make to him if all the frogs in France got alcoved into the drink ? This ai n't my party , he told himself , but when he got to Marion he forgot about getting drunk . He drove the Plymouths into the basement of the garage , put them on the rack , and gave them a good showroom job . He scrubbed the tar and grease from under the fenders , washed them good with a weak lye solution to fade the paint job out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They looked swell sitting there on the polished floor with the Oriental rugs placed beside them . He looked at them a minute and then walked back to the glass-enclosed office . It was twelve o'clock , but he picked up the phone and called his boss . The sedans are on the floor , ' he told Mr. Spencer . That 's fine , John . Come in late tomorrow . Get yourself some sleep , ' the man yawned into the phone . I ai n't comin ' in tomorrow , ' John told him , wondering just how he was going to say it . Okay , just take it easy . You got to make another trip . Roadsters . ' I 'm joining the army tomorrow morning , ' John said plainly . ' Better get yourself another grease-monkey . ' You 're what ? ' Mr. Spencer shouted . Hey ! wait a minute ! You nuts ? ' I 'm joinin ' the army in the morning . ' You 're nuts , or drunk . I 'll bet you twenty bucks you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What the hell you want to do that for ? ' He could n't think of any reason . I 'll be in around noon and collect that bet . So long . ' Mr. R. L. Spencer , automobile dealer , mumbled to his half-awakened wife that automobile mechanics were the craziest loons that ever lived , turned over on his side and went sound asleep . Mrs. Spencer glanced sleepily at the clock , impatientlyhoping that the days would pass quickly so she could get the winter curtains up and have that off her mind . Then she went to sleep , too .   John went back to his room , got out his traveling bags and the heavy brown suitbox and began packing his things away . He left out his new checked sports jacket , the gray flannel pants with the cuffs still rolled to the right length to show a part of his socks , a white shirt , and a new three-dollar tic . When he got everything together and placed the bags in the center of the room , it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never worry about it . That was the good part about moving around , he told himself . You did n't get yourselfall loaded up with a lot of junk . He crawled into bed , lit a cigarette and lay on his back , blowing the smoke toward a beam of moonlight that came in the window .. He lay there for a long time , and after a while he thought he had an answer . They 'll never draft me , he told himself . It 's coming , but they 'll never catch me . I 'll beat them to it . He could n't understand why suddenly the most important thing in his life was avoiding the humiliation of being drafted . It would never make sense to anyone but himself , he decided , so he had better keep his mouth shut or he 'd get a lot of hoots , but that was just about it . They were not going to draft him . Yes , that 's just about it , he thought sleepily , and , besides , I 'll win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get twenty dollars out of that old skinflint . And then , just before he went to sleep , he had a premonition that he was going to be gone for a long time . I 'll send my things back to Nebraska , back to Mom , and tell her to give them to someone . I 'm going to get out of this dump tomorrow and get myself into the army . But it had n't worked out that way , John remembered . He stayed in Marion for three days , a member of the armed forces , wearing his sports jacket and sharp gray flannels . Each morning he went down to the recruiting office and the sergeant let him dust the desks and sweep the floors , and told him to get back the next morning at eight o'clock or he wouldp37be A.W.O.L. sure as hell . On the morning of the fourth day , his orders came through and they shipped him out of Marion . Riding along in the Harpie , all that business seemed a long time ago and not very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half he had spent in ordnance milling out tools and parts . That had been a tough hitch , for it was n't like being in the army . It was like being back in one of the numerous plants he had worked in , so he put in for gunner and got himself into the air force . It was a funny thing , he knew , for he had never shot a rabbit in his life and yet when he got the 50-caliber in his hands , it was like finding an old friend after a long search . It was a slick gadget and he liked to break it down and put it together again . When he closed his eyes and listened to her slam her parts together , it always reminded him of the afternoon he was driving through Ohio and the announcement came over the radio . It did n't make much sense , but the two things went together and gave him a feeling of elation , a feeling of having found something that would hold him down for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , watchingthe Heavenly Body drop into a hole in the air . That 's why I am here . But he knew there was something else to it , some-t ping he had never been able to figure out , not even on all the other missions , but he felt he was getting close to it . It lay out there somewhere on the other end of the radio messages that Sheren was pulling out of the air . It lay out there for all of them , yet only the Harpie seemed to ride with calm certainty . Even Jerry was aware of it . Johnny wondered what it was . He thought for a while that it might be because Lelani had been so sure he would not come hack . She had cried a lot , had done everything he wanted to do , and asked only that he go to church with her once before he left . He remembered sitting there on the stiff bench thinking , Here I am shacking with a Gook girl and going to church with her . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got under his skin . He wondered what the guys would say if they knew that he had been to church with the woman he was shacking with . It did n't matter much , he decided as he stroked the grip of his machine gun , Lelani loved him , and she had said she 'd ask the Father to pray for him . THE HARPIE WAS BOX  --  SHAPED AND UNAP  --  pealing while she was inert , but once she felt the air against her wings she seemed to change . She was graceful and proud and flew along with the ease of an eagle . She rode along with assurance , for she had been to battle before and she went to it calmly again . The first hour went easily . The other ships had pulled away . Everyone checked the instruments of their function , moved about in the warm fuselage and looked occasionally at the restless blue Pacific beneath them . They felt a sense of freedom , being away from the earth and the things it held , and yet more strongly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . Each watched the other , knowing now they were a oneness as the fingers of a hand are formed into a natural member . A strong awareness of interdependence was with them , for each knew that their protection and their forcefulnessdepended on every other member . Walking along the narrow catwalk between the bomb-bays , Walt sensed deeply the relationships of this new family by which he had been adopted . He paused , leaning against the bomb-racks , looking ahead at Lieutenant George Kristenson bent over the navigator 's table . A strange sense of excitementP39was in Kris , Walt realized , though the storm had passed , and they flew along in a high clear sky . It had begun as soon as they pulled up above the field , as soon as the wayward currents of air began to force the surging life into the Harpie . In the ready-room and on the mat , Kris had been quiet and seeminglydisgruntled . He had said little , but kept moving around impatiently as if some unseen enemy hurried him toward the ship . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased laughter . Time and again he leaned across the narrow flight deck to Mike who sprawled beside the radio equipment . Look at this baby , she 's coming tine , ' he 'd said , indicating the accumulating strands of a storm . She 'll be a honey . She 's headed for the coast but she 'll never make it . She 'll die at sea , but she 's a beauty . ' She 's a big baby , ' Mike answered , vaguely interested . Kris turned back to the table , searching for the movement of other , more distant storms . He studied the clouds , vanguardsof violence , as if they held some foreboding message . lie mapped squalls and storms ahead of time and then , when the radio was not busy , he tabbed his speculations . It was not a part of his job , but he did it religiously . He checked them carefully , as if he had created the threatening storms and would not have them misdirected . He kept his hair cut short , hardly an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his face . The hairline , pale brown and indistinct , ran far back on either side of his temple and made his forehead look prominent and heavy . His eyes , partially concealed behind his glasses , were brown , and the fullness of his high cheekbones caused the arms of his glasses to cut little trenches in the flesh . But the awkward fullness was all in the top of his face ; his nose was thin and strong , his lips sharply defined and edged with a faint rim of white . There was no extra flesh around his jawbone , and the cleft iii his chin looked as if it had been struck there with a narrow instrument . He rarely shaved cleanly and the hair that grew in the groove of his chin made it appear even deeper . His face seemed to be made up of two parts and only the lower part was sensitive and appealing . No navigator in the Pacific could bring a ship down on a pinhead atoll with the cool assurance Kris had . He paid no attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances and screamed back that they saw a fleck of sand in the vast ocean . He stayed with his instruments and when he said coolly , You can take her down now , ' Jerry and the others knew that it was as sure as driving down from the ramp of a towering bridge ; the runway would be there . Flyingthrough clouds as thick as whirling soiled milk , there was no feeling like the knowledge that Kris was unhurriedly checking , rechecking , changing , calculating , exacting from the heavens the one unseen , unmarked path that led to safety . Whatever else happened , the Harpie would hold to her course . The men realized this and it appalled them that they knew absolutely nothing of the man who guided them so quietly . Often they had the feeling that they had been led in and out of catastrophe by a stranger . They felt that the translucent weather was revealed to Kris . That guy feels the weather in his bones , ' Jerry would say , but he knew that Kris 's knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuition . It was scholarly and exact , but it was something more than that , too . It had a preciseness that came from devotion . Its predictions were as understanding as those of the mother of a violent child , who knows silently the causes of his rebellion . On a warm April night in school , Kris had read Plato 's talk of high celestial things . He had put down the book and gone out into the spring night . The earth smelled fresh and new , as if it had been recharged with life , and the stars were high and bright , but in the west dark clouds were seeping over them , nebulous and insidious , and the troubled air that rushed across the campus was filled with an intoxicating mystery . He had stood on the wide steps of the library until the huge , spattering drops had driven him inside . That night he beganP41his study of the wind , the curious equalizer of heat in the atmosphere . Winds fascinated him . The names held poetry ; trade and anti-trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most notable of all , the storms of the temperate zones , the whirling , spinning storms that moved violently from the west to the east . He studied the way the earth absorbs heat from the sun , taking in more in the tropical zones than in the north , and the mathematical way the cold moved southward and the warm moved northward , for in time it must consume and neutralize itself . He learned the manners of moving air forces , visualizing the huge mountains of warm air as they spilled upward over the cold forces , causing rain . It was this union of the tropical and polar that caused storms , and by knowing the shape and form of each , its heredity , it was possible to predict the inherent qualities of the offspring storm . And yet it was not possible to predict that two forces would move toward each other , drawn by some infinite attraction , to create a definite storm . They moved in unexpected directions , affected by other air forces , by mountains , becoming wayward or purposeful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of nations . Dynasties had fallen , conquerors had been vanquished , and civilization itself had ! teen detoured by the violent offspring of these unions . Knowingno boundary of race or continent , or politics , or ambition , storms had struck providently for good as well as for evil . In all his study Kris had known no other force which had caused men to unite , without thought of race or creed , to overcome a common enemy . It was exhilarating to study it , but it made him furiously indignant that man could create war against man when there was a larger , more potent enemy always present . But he worked quietly , keeping his thoughts to himself , and only when he marked the spreading terror of a hurricane , did his voice become emotional . Then he sounded like the voice of the storm itself , speaking out its concealed fury . Jerry called him Old Elements , though he was only twentytwo . Turning on the small , folding seat , he looked back at Walt . Go on down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-six seconds . ' Swell . Thanks , ' Walt said , grateful for the guy 's thoughtfulness , but Kris was already back with his tabulations . Crawling under the flight deck , Walt let himself slowly down into the incandescent nose of the Harpie . I 'm comin ' down , ' he called ahead . I was just about to have tea , ' Lieutenant Frank Story said , looking over his shoulder and grinning . His legs were cocked high on either side of the bombsight and he was resting on the flat of his spine . He held a gruesomely illustrated pocket edition of a murder mystery in his hands , and let them sag down against the base of his stomach . And to what do I owe this thoughtful visit ? ' he asked in overly gracious tones . His blond moustache was humorously indistinct , but his bushy , ashen-colored eyebrows emphasized his soft gray eyes . Sure , and it 's good to see a fine Irish face . ' Screw you , ' Walt said , grinning back . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , ' Story remarked , astonished , to have islands flying about like the ducks . ' Go to hell ! ' May the saints forgive you . ' Laboriously , he dropped his legs and straightened in his seat . A fine man you are to go about swearing ... ' His eyes dropped to the small island just ahead of them . I 'll be a sonuvabitch , ' he breathed softly . Holy mackerel ! ' It 's a vision , ' Story said , leaning hard against the plexiglass . Beneath them , the small island passed slowly . It was long and thin , shaped Ile a fingernail buffer , and deep in the centerof it an oblong lake , aquamarine in the center and rimmedP43with deep cobalt where the foliage dropped shade against it , glimmered in the soft light like a gigantic jewel . A high bank ran completely around the water . It looked , from above , to be twenty feet high and every inch of it was massed with purpleand white and lavender orchids . They blossomed in massed festoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men looked down at the amazing , unharmed beauty and were silent . It was as if a man could throw himself here and wash away all that was unwanted , imperfect and unclean . Jerry lowered the Harpie , letting her ride on her left wing , and circled the island , the ship 's dark shadow following the blue Pacific that broke white and uneven , like ruching , along the edge of the immaculate jewel . As the Harpie lost altitude , the indistinct stems and branches appeared beneath the tumbling flowers , an intricate filagree , forming an exquisite brooch on the blue cloth of the ocean . Beauty , unexpected and inviolate , held them circling above the tiny atoll . They looked and looked , like men drinking , thinking each of a thousand times when he would want to recallit , but knowing it would never be as it was now . It would never have the purity . As they circled for the third and last time , each thought regretfully of the one with whom he wanted deeply to share it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerry heard again Betts saying ' Beloyed , ' and Johnny , leaning hard against his waist-gun position , thought that it would be swell to grab up a handful of them and leave them on the altar for Lelani when she came to pray . She 'd know then he had n't meant to kid her so much about it . And now , shared , the beauty diminished , and Norry wonderedidly what the whole bunch would bring on the market back home . Story straightened , his head coming up close to Walt 's , and he started to say something when a sharp metallic sound came up from near his legs . What the hell . . . ? ' he breathed , lunging forward quickly , for the bomb-release handle was jarred partially free . Almost as he said the words they heard , above the humming of the engines , a loud crashing sound back in the center of the Harpie . Story yanked the earphones in place . What ... Holy Christ ! ' His hand flew forward , grabbing the release handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercom phone . Sure . Sure . ' He turned to Walt , his bushy brows pulled fiercely together . Get back there . The bombs fell out of the rack . The release is out of the bottom one . Christ , get goin ' ! ' he added , though Walt was already crawling under the flight deck . Ahead of him , he saw Chief and Norry standing on the tiny catwalk , staring down at the jumble of hundred-pound bombs . They lay there like discarded , overripe fruit . Release the bombs ! ' Chief shouted wildly . That bottom n one is tripped . Release them quick , for Christ 's sake , the thing will blow ! ' Walt turned , shouting to Story as he moved . Release them , let them fall ! ' Story leaned forward , throwing all his weight against the bomb-release handle . It would not budge . He flung his other hand around it , yanked and pulled and tugged . I t would not move . It 's locked ! They 've fouled the doors ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fleeting molecule of time , it seemed that taut minutes passed . I t seemed that he could never get the voice to come up out of his throat . It 's locked ! ' he screamed above the roar of the engines . Chief , it 's fouled ! ' Chief stared at the snapped tackle-wire , his brown eyes darting quickly . It had broken , tumbling the bombs like spilled cordwood . They lay there lifeless , the bomb-bay doors locked . Only the bottom one had been snapped and now the time that was locked in it was freed , the seconds of its deadly timing were ticking towards its explosion . A searing , cracklingsound like fire eating through cellophane roared in his ears . His whole body seemed to be consumed with it . Mike lunged down from the flight deck . Holy God , it 'll go up , Chief ! ' P45The searing became a roar , sudden and violent . Like a picture pressed against his brain , Chief saw the Harpie suddenlyerupt , spreading bits throughout the air and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk ! ' Jerry screamed over the intercom . ' Get out ! ' Watts looked at him but made no effort to move . Kris shuffled his charts neatly and placed them on his desk . Johnny turned toward the window , shoving his 50-caliber to one side as he moved . The island was just behind them , no longer flowers for an altar but the altar itself . He lunged for his parachute , hearing Lelani 's thin voice intone breathlessly , ' Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven ... ' Pray for us , pray for us , he repeated , the words emphasized by the jerkingof his arms as the heavy harness slid across his back . The Harpie roared easily , unaware of the horrible miscarriagein her stomach . Chief 's body quieted . The picture seemed to dissolve ; there was only a small fire , a little fire on a desert path built by children . He had known this all his life and loved it . He moved to one end of the bomb-bay , yelling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norry ! I 'll take this end ! ' ' Our weight will force it open , ' Norry cried , but before he finished speaking , he was easing one leg down onto the overloadedbomb-bay door . The men waited tensely as Chief and Norry quickly put their feet onto the doors , holding their weight on their hands , and began to straighten . Above and through the Harpie 's roar , they listened for the tiny creaking , for the sudden , crashingrush of air and bombs and men down into the chasm below . The two straightened slowly , still holding one precarious hand onto the narrow catwalk . Chief stood free , his feet unevenlybalanced on the bottom bomb . Like a man long sick and weakened , Norry shifted his weight to his feet . The door groaned , the metal bending as they leaned slowly forward to pick up the first bomb . Though his hands felt the fat , round surface of the bomb , Norry did not see it . He seemed blinded by the screaming whistle of air up through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release , Story ! ' Pon shouted . They 're on the doors ! Hold it ! ' Story braced his feet , his hands white and bloodless about the small instrument . Mike ! ' Chief shouted as he and Norry lifted the first bomb free . Mike took the heavy bomb in his hands and moved side . wise back toward the waist gunner 's windows . John tossed his parachute aside , reached out his hands and together they slid the bomb through the narrow space and free of the ship . As they turned , Pon shouted for them to move aside . He held the hundred-pound bomb in his hands and speared it through the window . Their trips seemed endless and profitless . The sweat carne quickly to their hands . Their knees felt as if water washed around them . Seconds of precious time seemed to pass in single , shuffling step . Clutching the catwalk with one arm , Norry and Chi reached down with their free hand , one on each end of tit tripped bomb . Only moments mattered now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it seemed ages 1 fore Pon reached down and took it from them . He took i easily , resting it in the crook of one arm , and began scootii his feet sideways down the catwalk . His face was quiet an expressionless , though his movements were intent and elf cient . The fellows stood on the farther side of the retract belly turret and watched his endless shuffling . Reaching t window , he turned sidewise to it , held his bent arm high a slipped the bomb out into the air . They did not look at one another yet but waited , as if t last , unseen strands of terror still spread in the Harpie . Suddenly the air split , crashing against itself , and the tail cj. the Harpie flung itself upward and to the right . Jarred frutaP47their holds , the men stumbled and fell against the fuselage . Story , down in the nose , felt his hands thrown free from the bomb-release handle . He hit against the back of the seat and then , as the Harpie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face rested on the plexiglass through which he had ! ways watched for his target . He lay there a moment , not lure just what he had expected , but his mind kept repeating a trite phrase he had used since he first came into the army . ' ' Phis stuff is getting old . It 's got to stop , bud . This stuff is citing old . ' Motioning for Watts to take over , Jerry threw loose hisraps and whirled around and down onto the flight deck . As c  --  moved he kept patting every piece of the ship with whichis hands came into contact . Good girl , good girl , ' he repeated with each pat , but only now the blood was beginning o show beneath the surface of his face again . Chief and Norry sat on the edge of the catwalk , their feet  --  angling down into the bomb-bay space . He looked at them , ' tinting to throw his arms about them . He wanted to tell lem they had saved the Harpie for the fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not come . Get a little rough back here ? ' he asked , glancing at all of hem and wishing to God there was some way he could tell them how he felt . He was the captain of the Harpie . He wascommand . That was the way it would say it on paper andthe books , but it was n't that way at all . No one man could command the Harpie . Each did his job , ach did his share to secure her easy , determined flight . But here was something else that caused her to do the things that o designer , no engineer , could build into a plane . It was  --  mething each man carried inside himself and , carrying it , rive the Harpie , for it was here each was most alive . Look-g at the fellows , Jerry knew this . Each held it in his quiet ice , but it was not a thing with which they had long been familiar . It had never been with the Harpie before . It was new to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You guys know you refused an order . I told you to hit the air . ' They looked at him and grinned , knowing how proud he was of them , and how grateful , for like themselves , he realized that whatever his destiny might be , it was inextricably bound with the Harpie and the skies through which she roamed . THE HARPIE RODE ON , INDIFFERENT TO THE rushing wind which tore in through the bent bomb-bay door . The fellows listened to the strangely funnelled air and waited impatiently for the island which Kris said lay south and west , two hundred and nine miles off their course . Mike radioed ahead for an emergency landing , but it was Kris who suddenly became alive with the unexpected detour . There was a storm coming north and east from the trade winds around the wet islands . It had broken loose , like a wayward frolicking colt , just off the coast of Palmyra , but now freedom seemed to have caught in the wild hair of its mane . From all he could forecast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mad with its own freedom , going countercurrentwith all about it , there was no way of telling in which senseless direction it might plunge itself . Leaning over his charts and calculations , Kris figured that the Harpie would contact the storm around five o'clock . There was no sure way of estimating its growing force , no way of telling what violence it might develop within itself . Insensitive to all about him , Kris visualized this storm . Time and space passed too slowly for him . His palms andP49fingers ached to urge the ship in flight ; down across the Pacificthey had a rendezvous , and , like an impatient lover , he resented the last , longest hours of waiting . Down in his transparent roost under the nose of the Harpie , Story took up his mystery novel again . He was n't quite sure what had happened in the deep entrails of the Harpie , but he seemed to be all right now . No use getting your pants in an uproar just because nothing fouled up , he told himself , leisurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahead of him , white strands of clouds streamed inward . He watched them for a moment . It always seemed that they rushed directly at him and then , in the last splitsecond , flung themselves gaily to either side of the ship . Some day I 'll reach out there and grab me a cloud , he thought , scanning the pages for the familiar action . He let the book rest on the base of his stomach , his back arched sharply , and took up again the lurid tale of carnage and mad , calculated mayhem in the lowlands of Ireland . In the wet , howling night the village mayor talked earnestly with the vacationing vicar . Surely it was a sad and fearsome thing , they agreed , that someone had so thoughtlessly buried a rusty axe in Lord Pillionsby 's bushy white hair . It was a terrible tiling , Story commented abstractly , for it caused all the commonpeople to stay home , rimmed in by dark terror , and no one could foretell what might result from all those men forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was truly wonderful to speculate on , Story thought , forcing his attention back to the vicar . As yet he was unable to tell whether the churchman was an impatient grave robber on leave , or whether suddenly he would confront the criminal with an inescapable net of evidence . In that case , Story decided , the housekeeper would be clone in proper . She was a gruesome old wench , anyway , fit to haunt the dankest house , and he could n't understand why anyone old enough to sign his own name , much less govern a village of God-fearing , peaceful people , would have the crone around to demand forever that they bundle up warmly , as if warmth were any protection against a rusty axe . But it probably would n't end that way , Story decided . Any minute now , justice would fight its way to the surface . Sweet KathleenO'Rourke would be trapped by the rust under her fingernails , an unforgivable and tattletale piece of slovenliness on the part of a sedate librarian . But the strain of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to PillionHall to catalogue the old sot 's library , not to get herself caught with an unwarranted edition of her own . But it was her own fault , Story decided . Any man who went around stroking the fine leathers of rare editions was n't to be trusted . Many a girl had fallen quickly when a man jumped from old and rare classics to new and popular ideas . A girl should n't let her guard down just because a man slipped up on her behind a copy of Shakespeare 's Love Sonnets , ' circa 1723 . No , Katie had not kept her critical senses sharp , and a blunt axe had served for retribution . But I still wish someone would give that hag a broom , Story told himself , and tell her to start riding . The vicar was leaving now , going out into the dark night armed only with a rather worn copy of the Scriptures . Story sprawled comfortably , his mind filling the dark Irish countrysidewith innumerable creeping murderers . It made it more exciting when you ran in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the flight deck , between Mike and Kris , and folded his arms beneath his chin . He stretched out , glancing up at Jerry 's slightly bent shoulders , and feeling the miles slip through under his stomach , across the fuselage of the Harpie and into the unposted spaces behind them . Ile felt a sense of loneliness and rupture , of the pattern of his life with Lelani having changed , and yet there was a sharp releaseabout it . There were moments , little thoughtfulnesses , he would miss . There was the ingratiating flattery of her servile devotion ; but he knew that if he ever returned to those rapturous intimacies it would require a new beginning . SheP51might remain unchanged , but he would be different . Their emotions would be colored by the vibrant changes in him , and , unable to foretell the texture of this future bitterness , anger , or simple gratitude for any part of life left him , he thought of past intimacies , fondly detailing them in his mind . Lying there with his face close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen her . He had been a little crocked when he went to the luau . He had climbed out of the taxicab and walked slowly down between the two high rows of hibiscus bushes . He rememberednow that they had been pink and red blossoms , huge and vivid in the afternoon sun , and at the end of the lane he had come out on a low sandy beach . Tall coconut trees concealedmost of the milky sky , and under the shelter of their fronds there was a grass shack . On one side of it , strands of smoke crawled up through the damp sands ; it was a curious thing to see , furtive and smoldering . In front of the shack , a group of chairs had been placed in a semicircle around a small counter . It was supposed to be a bar , Johnny realized vaguely , but coming through the long row of flowers , glancing ahead , the chairs looked like a mourners ' row to him . It looked as if someone was going to sit there and weep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , he mumbled resentfully . Grabbing a beer from a fat , brown man behind the counter , a man who bobbed his head and smiled unctuously , John turned and winked to the two fellows who had invited him . He could n't remember where he had met them . He glanced at the women . They looked like thwarted landladies , temporarilyunoccupied . He walked over to the beach and lay down beside the barbed wire . He drank the cold beer slowly and watched the white breakers roll in toward the beach . For the first time in months , he thought of Marion and of the night he had carefullywashed the blue sedans and put them up in the showroom . He had felt a strong compulsion to get into the service then , a proud determination never to be drafted into the serv- ice of his country , but , lying on the warm sands , it did n't seem to make much sense to him . He smelled the damp , fishy odor of the sea and wondered why it was that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger exactly . It did n't grow as hunger grows . It was just that he had never found a gratifying fullness of life . There was still a void that must somehow be filled . He remembered being impatient for a single night to pass so he could join the army . Now he wished to hell that he was back in Ohio , driving a car down the highway , the road and what lay ahead free and easy to him . Rolling over on his side , he glanced at the cluster of people near the impromptu bar . He did n't know them from Adam and , by God , it did n't look like many of them bore any resemblance to the original . He wanted to get to his feet , walk out of the place and down the highway , for somewhere , he knew , there was an end to his impatience . He did n't know the cause of this growing compulsion toward some unrevealcd destination , but he knew he had only to get there and the answer would be waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of the shack , carrying their drinks with them , muttering in animal anticipationat what awaited them . Lifting one elbow , John watched . Two native men in gaily printed loincloths came forward with shovels . They lifted the damp sand and carefullyplaced it to one side . The clammy , miscolored steamlikesmoke increased . Then they knelt , their bodies sweaty and hot above the smouldering fire , and lifted a damp wet sack . The small grove began to fill with a sickening odor . Moving in closer to the hot surface , the men continued their fruitful excavation . They lifted one dank , gray sack after another . The cluster of people muttered in mock astonishment . The men moved in closer , lifting damp , steamed , dark green leaves up out of the gravelike hole . John felt a revulsion growing in his stomach . He tossed the beer can beneath the purple croton bushes and walked over to the bar . There wasP53a bottle of scotch , mainland liquor , on the counter , and he grabbed it up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the deep , steaming hole and what waited in it . There were bananas and curious island fruit backed on a layer of green leaves . The men lifted them gently , removed the leaves , and then the repugnant shape of the baked pig waited in the hole . Though it had been carefully placed there , above the hot , steaming rocks , it looked as if it had died and been buried hastily . John went back to his place on the beach and took a long drink . While the pig was being lifted and carried inside , the peopleshifted away , having a last drink before the feast was ready . A partly blond , sharp-nosed woman came across to John . She was of medium weight , medium age , and her hands were covered with massive jewelry . She wore a blue sharkskin dress with a huge red baboon above the breast pocket . Fascinating , is n't it ? ' Johnny looked up . Her voice had a peculiar , overlaid culture about it , as if she were keeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , it 's really native . Have you been to a luau be-fore ? ' No , ' John said . Want a drink ? ' She looked at him carefully , as if to determine whether he was large enough for some vague , future purpose . She smiled , looking down at him with half-closed , estimating eyes . Yes , I will have a drink with you , sergeant . ' He reached her the bottle . It 's good . ' ' Aloha ! ' she smiled , tilting the brown bottle , but her eyes remained on him , as if the uniform were of an alien country and she was n't quite sure how it was put together . Daintily , she touched the edges of her lips . Do you like the islands ? ' Johnny shrugged , wiping the bottle with his hand . It is beautiful here , ' she said , letting herself slowly to her knees . Do they work you hard , sergeant ? '   Johnny knew she was n't interested in whether he worked at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . She glanced in the general direction of the hibiscus path , meanwhile reaching vaguely for the bottle . John let her have it . The entertainers should come any time . ' " Lovely Hula Hands , " ' John repeated the title dryly You do n't like the native music ? ' You been here long ? ' She hesitated a second , toying with the red baboon . Only a short while . They really need us here so badly . I mean they have no one who can supervise the workers . ' John wondered how many years she had been beating her way around the islands . You going to stay ? ' he asked , knowing the answer . I feel good here , ' she said with furtive intent . I feel all warm , friendly . ' Her eyes passed down the barbed wire towardthe deep curve in the beach , but they did not go out to sea . I may go back some day . ' John lighted a cigarette , wondering what obstacle had to ha removed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? ' She took a drag on the cigarette , opened her mouth slightly , and let her lower jaw slide forward before she exhaled , an then she blew the smoke upward from her face . I try . ' Some fat native women , wearing long , nightgown shape blue and yellow and pink dresses came down the hibise path and stopped on the far side of the shack . Three gir were with them , their cellophane hula skirts sparkling in t shadow-broken sunlight . You got a place downtown ? ' John asked . She put her index finger between her opened teeth , tapping it up and down . She did not look at him but tapped away idly , considering . John knew what she was thinking ; he w twenty-one , maybe a little older : not so good . Maybe sonthing would show up . Have a drink , ' he said angrily . Okay , soldier . ' As she tipped the bottle , her eyes rovedP55over the cluster of men around the bar . Fascinating , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusting the sand from her blue dress . John lay back , the bottom strand of the barbed wire crossing above his forehead and looked up into the brown bottom fronds of the coconut trees . He wondered why it was imposSiblefor him to relax . He had always wanted to see things , but once he was outside of America , the things he wanted to are and be with were apparently back where he came from . The soft , high notes of the guitars floated out into the cooling ' ght and he listened to them resentfully . It would be swell to go out to Red 's place and play records on the juke box , hotjazz and boogie and a couple of hillbilly songs , he thought . I t would be elegant to have a girl in a clean white dress with neat white shoes , and a jaunty hat on her head ; a girl who liked to dance and talk and who said , Oh , no , time to go home , John . Come on , honey . ' And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into Marion she would sing to him . That would be swell , he thought , but he knew it was only another expression of his dissatisfaction . It would only appease him temporarily as all life did . Two large women strolled slowly around the corner of the ack , guitars resting comfortably on their bulging stomachs . hey were singing Lovely Hula Hands ' in a high , insistent me . Singing , they walked across between Johnny and the thers and stopped near the base of a palm . When they niched the song , the brown , unctuous man hurried across to loin with two cans of beer . They greeted one another as if lie whole thing were unexpected and delightful and , as soon r they finished the beer , they began playing again . Around the near end of the grass shack , the three girls ung their feet forward and back , dancing in the unsteady Ind . Their silver and blue and deep red hula skirts flung themselves forward and back , revealing thin brown legs with ach movement . Rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm , across the shoulder , down the left arm andP56ran vaguely off into the distance . Johnny sat up , watching them . In the center of the grove , the girls turned , forming a small triangle , and one of them faced John . She smiled at him , her hips bouncing voluptuously under the red cellophane . Iler face was pale , like cold tea , and her black , waved hair hung far down on her bare shoulders . She looked at Johnny , smiling , her shoulders pulled backwardso that the brassiere was like a tight band of crimson across her bosom . With the last notes of the music , she folded quickly to the ground , her hands delicately crossed before her breast . No bad , ' John grinned . She smiled to him . You like hula dance ? ' You ai n't just whistlin ' , ' John said , wondering if it was just the liquor that caused him suddenly to become vibrantly uncomfortable . You give me snow job , ' she said , straightening the strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' John insisted , noticing that sl had a large yellow butterfly pin in her hair . It looked as if it were about to take flight . I 'd better have some solid food . I do n't know how to eat this poi business . ' She glanced at the others and seeing that the older women were leaning their guitars against the tree , she turned back happily , nodding her head . I am Lelani . ' My name 's John . ' He offered her a cigarette . Hey , you have to eat that poi stuff with two fingers ? ' No , I show you how . Luau good kind food . ' Let 's go , ' John said , getting to his feet and reaching on his hand . She took it lightly and , leaped to her feet . Inside the hut , candles had been lighted . They stood i holders high above the long tables , throwing their uneve light down on the immense green leaves . Long and sp. ; shaped , the leaves had been carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design around the cc " P57of the table . Huge mounds of food were placed in wooden bowls around the table , but everywhere there was a space brilliant red poincianas and flame-colored hibiscus had been placed . The soft sides of the hut were dark in the pale light and the peaked ceiling vaguely shaped itself in the shadows above . Only the light and the brilliantly colored flowers stood out in the room , and even the light seemed subdued by tine heavy , spicy odor of the food . It was intoxicating , for the heady odor spread upward from the luxuriant green leaves and seeped into the soft walls of the hut . It seemed that they ate for hours . The darkness closed in around the hut , causing it suddenly to be warm and friendly , and in the soft light Lelani 's brown skin took on the glow of golden-beige satin . John ached to touch it as if it had become unreal . He put his leg against hers and felt her warmly returnthe concealed caress . He watched the delight with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own plate she gave him a large portion . Have some more , Johnny , ' she urged , smiling at him , and he knew that both of them were waiting for the hour of their consummation . It came two hours later . He watched her dance again , saying to himself , This is going to be mine . But by the time they walked , with loud and purposeful good-byes , up toward the hibiscus path , a heavy sleepiness had come over him . The desire was n't gone , but it was not quick and sharp as it had been . The woman with the red baboon pin waved good-bye to them with sympathetic envy , and John walked along beside Lelani , his mind repeating the word fascinating , fascinating , fascinating . It had an impetuous rhythm , repeated softly . When they reached the highway , Lelani took his hand and they walked along the road for about a hundred yards and then turned across a low wall and back toward the beach . At the edge of the field , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung their branches into the night but a tall plumeria tree grew above them , its blossoms pale and white in the moonlight and its fragrance heady and honey- sweet . Lelani gathered some of the fallen blossoms , looking into the creamy-yellow stars concealed in their five whitepointedblossoms , and then slowly she crushed them hard against her forehead and lay back against the soft earth . Johnny , ' she whispered softly , and what had been fire in him was gentle and tender now . He was not acting the way he thought he would . He moved carefully , so that he would not hurt her , for he knew that in his desire resentment lay close to the surface ready to break in unwanted anger . You 're nice , Lclani , ' he said , and then for a while his impatience was gone . BY FOUR  --  THIRTY , KRIS SAT TENSELY AT TIIF , small table waiting for the wind to begin its charge against the sides of the ship . At first the left wing kept smacking upward , as if lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endsthe mane of the stallion storm , Kris told himself . Roarin into the vast air pockets , the Harpie dropped sharply as if the fluency had been taken from her wings . She went down quickly and when the air caught her again , the men bounced hard against the floor . John straightened and rubbed lhisi eyes , for he had gone to sleep , his face close to the dusty floor . Again the Harpie dropped , but this time when the ai caught against her wings , she took quick and steady flight down across the southern sky . Kris waited . He could tell by the roar of the engines that the air was suddenly as smooth as a liquid without substance . He stacked his charts neatly , stepped across John and bent low to move forward into the nose . P59Hello , Elements ! ' Story called , holding the book up in his hands . It was the vicar 's mute sister . Old Lord Pillionsby done it to her . Hit her with a riding crop when she was twelve . Stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flake them to the flower show . Now he 's dead and in hisgrave , and her headed for the hangman 's house . Come a cropper , they all did . ' What 're you talking about ? ' Kris asked absently , staring off to the northwest . Story held the book up toward the guns above him . I get a kick out of these damned things , ' he said . Kris did not speak . His eyes were fastened on a large mass of twisting , tumbling clouds . They were rolling , like a nebulouscolumn , up across the Pacific . She must have been a beauty . Lots of water 'll come out of her . ' Rough , eh ? ' Kris nodded . He could see that already the storm was spending itself . It would die out there at sea , and it seemed tragic to him that such unnatural force created by Nature should go unconsummated . He thought of the endless storms and twisters of nature that died unwitnessed and it seemed that mankind , small and fretful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself left none . Neither war nor peace really left a mark and so they were inconsequential and temporary . That was the thing to realize . That was the thing that could equip a man to fight . It gave him a sense of abandon and indifference , and when he looked on his own life this way , it gave him a studied freedom he had never known before . He envied the other fellows their flippancy , but in all of his life he could not remember a time when the unimportantleft him other than laboriously amused , while the essential things gave him a feeling of dizzy amusement . Always success or failure had seemed to hang on a single thread , quixotic and unpredictable , and the knowledge that they were so precariouslyseparated gave him sardonic pleasure . The blue and white of day were giving way to the bright heralds of night when Jerry looked directly ahead and saw the tiny island Kris had told him to expect momentarily . It lay like the partly exposed back of a giant fish , its fin hoisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once while Mike identified themselves and waited for the okay and then Jerry nodded to Watts . Gotcha , ' Watts said , glancing downward as he worked the flaps and began the slow lowering of the landing gear . It squeaked stubbornly as it lowered , but the Harpie came down easily , sure of her way . Story glanced eagerly through the plexiglass as the earth approached him . The island looked as if it had once been a mound , but some Herculean giant had stood on its peak and deftly spaded one whole section into the sea . On the windwardside of the island , the mountain rose straight and sharp , its sides ribbed with narrow , upright ravines . Down each of these a veil of white water cascaded in the evening light . Almost a mile of green land ran out from the base of the mountainto the white beach that met the sea . Lengthwise across the green carpet , the runway flung itself . The Harpie dropped close to the water , losing altitude as her engines reverberated against the waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his window , John saw the camouflage nets suddenly become artificial and apparent from a few feet above the ground . Their primary , smeared colors stood out against the rich foliage and earth shades , and beneath each net mechanics and crew men hurried out to stare at the unexpected Liberator that hit the metal mat , her wheels giving out shrieks against the sudden , powerful contact . Everyone on the tiny island seemed to be running toward the Harpie . These jerks are nuts , ' John said to Walt , who peered out the slot beside him . I 'll bet they think we 're movie actors . ' But the men who crowded , yelling and eager , about the Harpie , were n't looking for movie actors . They were looking for mail from home , some news of the world they lived to seeP61again . They were looking for someone who spoke their languageand could tell them about Kansas City , Fresno , Scranton , and Atlanta , about the Blue Ridge Mountains and the wheat harvested along the rich beds of the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How 's the President ? Did Betty Grable have a baby , or get married ? A whole big section was tore out of the magazine . We could n't tell . They still makin ' beer ? Got any lettuce on that crate ? I want to cat a head of lettuce and stick my face in a pail of milk ! ' Jerry hopped down to the ground , followed by the others . A jeep pulled up beside the Harpie , and a young blond guy , his head barely topped by a soiled fatigue cap , his body bare and brown but for a pair of shorts cut down from summer suntans , jumped down and hurried toward them . He removed his huge green sunglasses with his left hand and extended his right to Jerry . I 'm Captain Royce . Sorry you had trouble , ' he said . Now that the glasses were removed , his brown face held two immense white circles , one around each eye as a clown applies make-up . Tough stuff . ' We dumped it overboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's bent up a little and we need a load . ' Bud , if you 'll sit down and tell us about the outside world , ' Royce said happily , we 'll fix her with our bare hands . ' Jerry turned to introduce the others , but they were already surrounded by a group of men , talking wildly , and beyond them some fellows were rolling equipment up to the Harpie . How 's for chow ? ' Strictly dehydrated , ' Royce said , motioning to Watts and Story and Kris . Come on , we 'll wash up first . At least the water has n't been dehydrated . ' Good deal , ' Story said . Do I get to sing for my supper ? ' Walt was amazed at the barrage of questions the circle of men threw at him . Somehow they had learned in a moment that he had recently come from the States . No question was ever completely answered before a dozen more were asked ,   and they all stood there in the shade of the Harpie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hot engines in their nostrils . Once in a while , a soldier would get a complete answer to his question . A short , middle-aged man , his thin hair cropped close to his head so that the features of his face seemed more projected , shoved his way forward . Sarg ! Hey , sarg , did they increase the allotment ? I got two kids now . Did they increase it ? ' They 're voting on it now . It 's in Congress , I think . ' In Congress , ' the man repeated . It 's in Congress , ' he said again , generally , and then he turned and walked hurriedly toward the camouflaged bunker , walking alone , wanting to digest and realize all that these words meant to him and those he loved . In Congress , ' he repeated quietly , pausing by the concealed workbench , his hands running quickly over the greasy tools . He felt each one , remembering how long it had been he had waited to know . Homer Harlan Miller , private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free government at work for him and for Mary and little Rose Ellen and for the new boy , Homer Harlan . The whole government was thinking of him and those he loved and they were going to take care of them . His family would be secure now , until he returned , and for the first time in months tears ran down his cheeks as he prayed ; the hot wells of gratitude and relief poured from his quiet eyes . His prayer was simple . Thank you , thank you , thank you , ' he repeated as he arranged each tool in an orderly row . It was hard for him and the thousands like him to love or to hate violently , and now that hatred of an enemy was constantlygrowing in him , love only came in infrequent and overwhelmingwaves , pouring itself out in gratitude for its own existence and with it now were all the unexpected wonders of free government , of men meeting in congress to help their fellow men . The relief was a glorious thing , shining about his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned toward the mat . The giant ship rested there , her sidesP63and wings bronzed by the sunset . He had never seen one look so dignified and purposeful . I ' 11 help fix her up , ' he said to himself . I ' 11 fix her up for Congress . ' Norry and Chief and all the crew found that the barrage of questions was quickly changing into fierce bargaining . As they neared the shacks where the men bunked , they tried to answer , saying they had no extra flashlights , no batteries , maybe an extra knife , no , no , no books , yeah , maybe Story has some , no candy , beer , hell , no , do n't you , no flints , maybe an extra sweater , yeah , I think so , coat hangers , God , no , five dollars for lighter flings , man , you 're crazy , a watch , yeah , but I need it , two hundred dollars , Jesus , you guys make your own money , fishhooks , fishhooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have it , go ahead , sunglasses ? Yeah , but I need them . ' Sure , I reckon you do , flyin ' , ' the sergeant said . What else you got ? ' Chief laughed . The frantic desire to have something new , even if it were unusable , seemed senseless to him . They paused near the little shack and dropped down beside the neatly cared-for path . Four or five fellows came bounding through the door , their shorts hanging loosely on their hips . They were carrying small cloth bags in their hands . They flung themselves on the ground , tossing the packs of cigarettes they carried down beside them and slowly and lovingly brought forth the contents of their worn , drawstring bags . As if from endless practice , they quickly displayed the beautiful shells in majestic little rows . Boy , look at those ! ' Pon said , as a corporal , deeply proud of his collection , spread the shells in the grass before him . They were small , like the tiny pear-shaped tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream color and covered with symmetrical rows of rich brown dots . They were polished and gleaming . I got eight of them , ' the corporal said . All the same size . ' The fellows turned from one collection to another , looking at the beautifully intricate shells . Some were like miniature golden conch shells ; others were large and rough , but held the mysterious memory of the surf , some were tiny pieces of shell polished and buffed until they took on a pristine beauty . They were like the remnants of once great treasures . What are those ? ' Mike asked . The young Puerto Rican soldier beamed with pride . A huge tattoo covered his hairless chest . It had crossed flags , a shield as large as a hand and above it an eagle , fiercely ready for attack and , spread above it all like the morning sun , the blood-red words Remember Pearl Harbor . ' A blue star had been tattooed on the back of each of his hands but now he removed the right hand from atop the left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rose in a pure white mound and in its very peak there was a dark shadow , curiously like an eye . It 's a cat's-eye , ' he said . Is it a shell ? ' Mike asked . Sure . ' He picked the shell up and carefully laid it in Mike 's hand . Took me two weeks to polish that one . ' While the other fellows studied the product of such long , tedious workmanship , he reached his hand into the cotton bag and brought out another . Slowly , one by one , he displayed ten beautifully matched shells . It 's a necklace for my girl , ' he said , proud of this gift he had dreamed and made in the ' hours of his loneliness . He took the shells in one hand , lay back on the grass and carefully arranged them necklace-like across the base of his brown neck . Going to be a hell of a beautiful necklace , eh ? ' The bargaining petered out because no one wanted to bargain . It had really only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now , in all of them , was the warm and good feeling for which they had waited . Here , Mike , you take this , ' a short , wiry communications man said . Mike looked at the beautifully polished shell . He knew how long it had taken to search for it on the sun-blinding coralP65reef , and the hours that had been necessary to achieve its gleaming polish . Give you five bucks . ' Up my tail ! ' the fellow said , intently looking out toward the water that isolated them . There was no price to be placed on these things and they both knew it . Love and endless , homesick hours had produced them . Agonizingly lonely days and nights , broken only by enemy raids , had been pressed bard into their surface and you could not buy or sell those things . Sold impersonally , they would not be disposed of , but , given to someone who knew the things which had been rubbed into them , they could be carried away , a thing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ; there must be some way of disposing of these days and weeks and months that accumulated in the storage of the mind . Go ahead , take the damned thing . Maybe it 'll bring you luck . ' Jesus , that 's swell , bud , ' Mike said , gently accepting the gift and considering how soon he unobtrusively could give the guy his pocketknife . I 'll give it to my girl , ' he added , briefly wondering when he was going to have a chance to find one . The sun disappeared , the sky flared red and orange in belatedglory , and they exchanged their gifts behind brusque , bantering deprecation . Each knew that however small the gift , it would change the days of the receiver . Tomorrow , when another day drifted up over the tiny atoll , there would be immense avenues of new interests ; there could be hours spent just keeping a knife clean and sharp . A cover could be made fin- it , and the cover could be waterproofed with the new stuff they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with shells and metal from the salvaged plane parts so it would really be hot stuff , the wiry guy thought . Man , the things you could do with a knife , he speculated , laying it on the ground beside him where he could look at it . Sitting on the knoll above the beach , the fellows placed their mess kits on the ground and looked out across the familiar waters while they ate . By the time they came to the orange jello , it had turned to liquid and had a fine coat of sand on it .   They stirred it up well so it would be evenly distributed . You 've got to eat the jello , ' a handsome , dark-haired fellow said , spooning up some of the warm , thinning dessert . Ma n can not live by sand alone . ' When they had finished eating , they washed their mess gear in the halves of oil tubs which held boiling soapy water and two rinse waters , so the K.P . ' s could get their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knoll above . the Pacific . They talked slowly , their questions becoming more spaced and more vital , and all of them listened whenever Walt spoke . He had come most recently from the States and there was no way of knowing when he might unconsciously speak the answer to a gnawing question , a troublesome , personalworry that could not be bluntly exposed . They listened with the edges of their minds . They lay on the sand listening to the voice that confirmed their worries , assured their scant knowledge , and pulled across the endless months memories of things they had once known . I had ten days before I came over ... ' Ten days ? How much time is that ? Today is Thursday or Friday or Saturday , ten days would be , it would be ten days ago . I got to go home . My girl lives in Elmira . Everyone has bicycles there .. Everybody has bicycles ! How strange it must seem . Could they be red bicycles , or blue ones ? Do people steal them ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fun , though , everyone riding bicycles . You 'd look sweet on the rumble seat ... . Christ , everybody works ... ' Everybody works . That 's nice . I never did have a job . Not a real job . It must be swell having everybody working . Mother wrote that she was working , packing shells in a factory , but I could n't see it . I 'd have to see it to believe it . Everybody in the United States working , and riding bicycles . I 'd like to see that , all right . P67Ginnie got some time off . . . Ginnie 's my girl , ' Walt said , reaching into his pocket for her picture . You know what we did the first day ? We went out and bought stuff . ' I 'll bet . ' Sure we did . But , boy , the crowds , and nothing in the stores . ' All the stores crowded and nothing in them . Maybe some handkerchiefs and a few old winter ties . It must be strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in it . Used to be the other way around ; the counters were full and everybody was outside . Sure must have changed back there . I 'd like to see it , I think . Boy , she 's something . ' He passed the picture on to the next guy . Hey , man , is she stacked ? ' Walt smiled . That 's what a guy liked to hear ; good-looking and stacked the right way . Yeah , she 's blond , ' he told the corporal with the immense tattoo . Pretty kind of blond . That 's the dress we bought when we went to the store . ' There was a dress in the store . Must of been other things , too . People say there 's nothing in a place and they mean there 's a lot . They do n't know what nothing is . Nothing is nothing , and people ought to learn to use the English language . ' Then stores are probably full of things you could buy  --  pretty things . Now a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They looked at each other 's girls and they looked at a lot of girls who did n't belong to any of them . The clouds lowered and the sun , far down below the horizon , threw its last light up against them , forming a low golden ceiling across the distant heavens . The billowy , uneven clouds , like a massive canopy , formed an exit for the last of the clay 's light . Cool air came in from the ocean and they smoked quietly . At the foot of the knoll , between them and the first dingy shack , a tall , thin kid came out with a guitar . He was one of the K.P . ' s , Pon realized , a kid with long dangling arms and thin hands , a mass of curly brown hair and blue eyes with thick boyish lashes around them . The fellows called him Tennessee . He wore a dirty white undershirt and an old pair of green fatigue trousers , greasy and soiled . His hands were white and soft from the kitchen work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pon 's mess tray , he had said , How ya doin ' , bud ? ' Right on , ' Pon had answered . How long you been here ? ' Nine months . ' Holy hell ! ' Bud , I 'm goin ' to be here for the du-goddamned-ration ! ' Tennessee had exploded , and then he laughed a high , remarkinglaugh . He sat down with the guitar and began tightening the keys , flipping at the strings , unsatisfied , and then he tried a few bars and tightened the keys again and tried some more bars . Finallyhe began strumming softly , gaining and freeing the music in the last light . Others came out and joined him , and in a short while they were singing . The garish colors of the sunset evaporated quickly but th moon had not waited . It was high in the evening sky befor the thin horizon light was gone . Undiminished now , its pal yellow light spread over the shack and the beach and fel warmly on the water . Another guitar and a harmonica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' playing it slowly , with breaks so the melody had the peculiar , spaced rhythm o a colt trotting across the prairie . . . and the skies are not cloudy all day . ' They finished the song , discussed a number of others , but not until the harmonica began a song did they agree on one . It was a plaintive , sad ballad of a Georgia boy who had gone west to the range . Tennessee sang it in a clear , boyish voice , understanding the deep and simple desire . I 'm going home to mother when the work 's all done this fall .... '  |p69Fellows  moved out from the shacks where they had been writing letters or fixing their bunks for the night . They came out slowly , edging toward the music and some of them came out singing , or calling ahead for a particular song they wanted sung . Norry and Walt and Chief and all the others lay back , aware of their new buds near them and staring into the growingyellow light of the moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of mydreams . . . Chief sang the words softly , almost humming them . Hehad always liked the song . It was written about a place in Virginia , he thought , but there were no trails like those that carried a man up and over the great mountains of the West . And the nightingales are singing .... ' Mike thought that in all the words he had read or heard , none held the wonderful tranquility of these . There was a sure and eternal quiet , somewhere , and in it the faint music of nightingales to make it beautiful and real ... . And the fair moon beams ... He always sang it fair moon ' because he liked the words . They reminded him of this night with the maize moonlight spilling downward onto the earth , shaping everything in unrealvagueness . In such a night there was no violence , no harm , no unkindness of man to man . In such a night , sweet , unending rest lay upon the world . There was no beginning or end to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to man held greater abundance than the physical man . There was a serenity of being which eventually became impregnable , containing within itself both continuity and completeness . It was like walking through the valley of death and fearing not . t was a thing a man dreamed of , being subject to death . There 's a long , long night of waiting .... ' Tennessee alone strummed away . The others sat idly smokingand waiting for a wanted song to reveal itself in their memory , the pattern of its melody spreading out quickly in their minds . Once in a while he sang a few lines , just the brief lyrics he liked , and they were old and vivid pictures of tragedy and sorrow and love . The strong force of yearning came over him , and he sang of men far from those they loved , of lonely men who poured their love on their animals , on the mountains and hills and rivers which directed the destiny of their lives . He sang of children alone in grief , and the yet greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads of America , the wide and narrow rivers , he sang of cabins in the mountains and fine homes in the towns , he sang of the railroadsand the deep coal mines and he sang of the floods and storms , the memorable violences America had known . All the things that had been in America 's birth were here and they seemed to remain suspended in the eerie yellow night . It lay white on the hill and looked like reflected silver above the water , but in the sky above them , where the yellow moon hung , it caught up the color and gave itself depth and apparent substance . It was a bewitching illusion , and the fellows did not talk , but each relived some familiar memory recalled in the tapestry of the music . Each looked into the golden night and visualized again things which could never be forgotten nor taken away from them . In the alien night , they were heartened and warmed and renewed and the young ballad singer with the pale hands spoke quietly of forces historyfails to record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole being stir , for he was moved by the tremendous richness of his purposefullyuneventful life . He was overwhelmed at the vast things which had created love in him . He had never realized that so much of America , so much of the life of people he had never seen , had become a part of him . The whole contour and texture of his being was made of these things as the rain and soil and sun , free and abundant , shape and form the unawaretree . They had created a rich and dormant love in him and that love , alone , he knew , could cause him to do mortalcombat . Hatred could never be compelling in him . I I e could never fight from vengeful hatred , but he could nutP71fathom the strength which love would expel for the protection of everything , known and unknown , which had been vital in his growth . Nothing they had , nothing which could ever be sent to them , could contain so much of home as this recreated Americaheld in the night above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever their lives might become , it would always be so . These were the things of the heart and mind and spirit . They were indestructible . It was a proud and clean thing to know that love caused you to do battle ; it had been so even with the Creator . IN THE QUIET TIME BEFORE DAWN , JERRY walked across the mat toward the Harpie . In the fading night light , she squatted near the camouflaged bunker . He looked at her , thinking of the immense weight she could carry , the thousands of miles she could fly without putting her stubby gear to the ground . Six tons of bombs at three hundred miles per hour for a distance greater than that from Chicago to I lonolulu . It seemed impossible that she could sustain the beatings she had taken . She seemed lifeless and forceless now , and that was what pleased him . In the air , she drew on endless strengths . She brought forth power and fight and stamina with unbelievable grace . It was this he liked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than could be expected . There was no end to the reserves on which she drew to complete a mission . It was as if she had an infinite capacity for achieving the improbable .   Pon was there , as always , waiting casually beneath her right wing . It was good to see him . Whatever the mission , search or combat , Pon was always there saying quietly , She 's ready to go up , Chief . ' Pon had in him the purposeful satisfaction found in all men who tend fearsome things . Jerry had seen it at fairs and exhibitionswhere prized and captured beasts commanded awe . He had seen it , too , where men handled new machineries whose potentialities could not be measured . These men never appeared to have a personal life . They had no existence beyond the tending of their frightful charges . They developed an impersonality , a detachment from their kind , that made them indifferent to the normal impulses of mankind . They became fretful and unhappy away from their work . The foibles of men could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking ahead of him at the silhouette of the massive ship and the thin man who stood beneath her wing , Jerry realized what a deep devotion existed in Pon . Like all men of his kind , Pon thought of the Harpie as being delicate and helpless . He understood her moods . He fretted over her and loved her , Jerry knew . He knew , too , that many a beast , gigantic and fearsome , had died from anguish when its tender had gone . I hope Pon is always with the Harpie , Jerry thought , crossingbeneath the shattered coconut tree and around the edge of an exploded taro patch . The damp , moist odor of the earth was in the air . It carried with it the curious odor of new leaves and dead fronds , of growth and rot , and he was glad to strike the edge of the mat where the familiar odors of oil and gasoline waited for him . He walked easily now , thinking that he had never known the Harpie without Pon , and that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only superstition and fancy , he told himself , but he knew fancy and impulse were the motivations which guide a man through death-charged moments when no reasonable pattern could exist . P73Jerry glanced back toward the shacks . He could see the indistinct shapes of the men as they moved out from their fretfulsleep . He recalled endless mornings with other crews , other Norrys and Johns and Waits , and he recalled the feeling lu. had had , moving from one bed to another , shaking the men into wakefulness , calling them from restless sleep to tense and terrible days . Many times , after lone days and nights of ceaselessflying , he had wanted to let them sleep . They had jumped quickly under his touch , and he had wanted to shout out that they could take the war and shove it , they could have the whole bloody mess , but always he had had to reach down gain and gently shake the quaking shoulder . They wouldumble and complain and then , awake , move quickly to their bounden duty . Watching them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dreadful . They went to it quickly , glad for another day in which they were yet alive . He remembered the morning when Norry awakenednd moved about like a man , a very young man , in dreadful cep . His body reacted to his will , but he could not get hisice to respond . The lower part of his face would move in ontortions , the muscles of his throat would clench , but only it escaped out through his mouth . Speech would not come . t had been hours later , as the Harpie carried them down cross the Pacific , that Norry had managed to force uncordinatedsounds out through his throat . Then he had said , Coddam you for wanting to leave me behind . ' This was part of what he had tried to tell Betts , but there is no way of describing the spirit which is reposed and ready . In the urgent nights of their honeymoon , there had been no way of telling her that he must return to his ship and the men who flew her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that men ready to die for an ideal , command silently . They do not suffer the humiliation of asking . No man could ask anything of life who forswore the silent command . Just as Story , always last to appear , raced across the mat , Private Miller stuck his head into the ship , looked about soft whistle . It seemed to have life ; a minute celestial organism , perfectly shaped . What you going to do with it ? ' he asked . Walt shook his head . We ought to keep it , ' he said , meaninglessly . It 's beautiful . ' Let 's put her up here . ' Holding the star tips in his fingers , he placed it against the ceiling of the cockpit . It 'll bring us luck . ' Jerry looked at him and winked . Hey , Pon , come here . ' Pon came across the flight deck and looked at the star placed against the ceiling . I 'll fix it , ' he said . He was back in a moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's roof . Now , she 's got a star in her hair , ' Jerry told then grinning . Watts settled in his seat , tightening his belt . Queen of the skies , ' he said pleasantly . The harpie of the heavens wears a pearl in her hair . ' " Bout like that , ' Jerry answered . Story leaned into the cockpit . He had a stack of worn hooks under his arm . Let 's get the show on the road , ' he said . I traded that stinker about mayhem on the moors for an Ellery Queen . Man , I got enough books to scare the hell out of myself . Let 's get the show on the road . ' One by one , the Harpie 's engines kicked into action . She kicked little flames into the strengthening dawn and then raced down the mat . Pon glanced out the waist-gunner 's slot and saw someone get up from the end of the mat where he had been quietly smoking . He raised his head and looked at the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands deep into his . pockets and started up toward the mechanics ' shack . As Watts retracted the gear , Jerry could feel the heavy weight of the Harpie . She was loaded again , ready for her purpose , and he let her climb slowly , circling the tiny atoll and then he turned her south and west . In the cool morning , P74quickly and seeing Walt , called quietly , Sarg ! Hey , Sarg ! Can I see you a minute ? ' What 's cookin ' , bud ? ' Walt asked , stepping toward the slight , middle-aged man . I . . . I . . . ' the man began and then , unequipped with the expedient words , he reached his hand forward . Here , take this . ' Walt looked down into the grease-seamed hand . . The brown , opened palm held a small , perfectly shaped pearl star . Hardly larger than a half dollar , it gleamed richly in the fresh light . Jesus , that 's pretty ! ' Go ahead , take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timid offering . What for ? ' Go ahead , you take it . ' Without waiting , he dumped the star into Walt 's hand . Thanks , bud , that 's swell of you ! ' Miller bent down , easing his way from the ship . You said that was in Congress , did n't you ? That allotment is right in Congress , did n't you say ? ' Yeah , it 's in Congress , ' Walt mumbled , his eyes on the small pearl , star . Thanks , soldier , ' Miller said and was gone , hurrying away toward the shack beneath the pandanus trees . Walt stood , staring at the star . Made from some giant , pearl-lined shell , it was thick in the center , its points proportionedbeautifully , each coming to a delicate peak that seemed to disappear instead of having a definite end . They gleamed rich and wonderfully pure , and the heart of the star seemed to have no dimensions , but to go on into unending depths . Holding the star in his cupped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flight deck and bent over Jerry 's shoulder . Look what the guy gives me , ' he said . Jerry looked at the pristine , iridescent star and let out
