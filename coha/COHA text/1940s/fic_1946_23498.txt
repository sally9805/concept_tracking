THE INNOCENT BYSTANDER A Story MARGARET SHEDD ET out , Appolonio , I 've already told you I wo n't leave the house nor go near that pier until I 've finished this lobster . " " Yes , sir , but the Sarah K she have docked , sir , and waiting urgent for you to sign her papers . " " So , let her wait . " This man at the dinner table had two speech mannerisms . One was a faint lisp marring his otherwise precise diction . The other was that often , as now , he talked to himself rather than the listener . " A wait 'll do them good . The only schedule that damn schooner keeps is to dock at my mealtimes . They expect me to go running out to clear her no matter when she puffs over the horizon . " " Yes , sir . " " Well , go on , get out , yOu black idiot . Do n't fidget there in the doorway . " " Yes , doctor sir , but them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger about his dog him . " " Dog ? " And for the first time the white man looked up from the food , his bored , fastidious expression changing to wariness . " Yes , dog ! " This was a young man , evidently the American and evidently still in high anger . He pushed Appolonio out of the way . " My dog ! A Doberman bitch . And my name 's Appleby , geologist for the oil people . Maybe I should n't burst into your house , but they say you 're in charge here . Your customs man or whatever he is in the commodore hat tells me I ca n't land my dog . I had to shove him into the sea , hat and all , to get off the Sarah K myself . " The vigilance in the other man 's face hardened into anger , but he finished cracking a lobster ' claw before he spoke . " How do you do , Mr. Appleby . " He did not extend a hand . " I 'm Forsyth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Officer here , and in the absence of the District Commissioner , acting in that capacity too . So you 're flouting my jurisdiction , is that it ? " The voice was nothing but a lisping whisper . The young man flushed . " I 'm sorry , Dr. Forsyth , but that official of yours was pretty abusive about Sabina . She 's been with me all along the coast and this is the first trouble I 've had . I 'm only going to be here a few weeks , inland on survey . " It seemed to him his words floundered around for lack of a listener . The doctor did answer , but to himself , contemplatively : " Sabina .. . " and then , " and has Sabina had her rabies shots ? " " You do n't think I 'd bring her down to Central America without them , do you ? Say , what 's got into you people around here ? Ca n't you leave a fellow alone to do his work ? I tell you I 've had Sabina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes ? " Finally the doctor looked straight into the young man 's face . " Have you ever gone dog hunting , Mr. Appleby ? " The words were bad enough , but the doctor brought them out so carefully , molded his lips around them so explicitly , that it was evident he wanted the other man to see what was in his mind : the howling , underfed , hunting whelps of that country , but on the wrong end of hunting this time , scattering frantic through the village streets , their speed only just less than the bullets that pursued them ; or turning at bay , wolfish and snarling , their mouths open , ready to receive death meted out at close range . Appleby got something like that , all right , and his first reaction was to remember Sabina left at the mercy of the officious customs officer . Like master , like servant , he thought anxiously . " Say , those brash black boys of yours wo n't molest my dog , will they ? She 's in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sarah , but bring him ashore without my permission and I 'll shoot him . " Him , thought the young man ; he knows her name is Sabina , he said it twice . This seemed more than carelessness ; it seemed to be part of the fellow 's distorted insensibility , and it made Appleby very angry . He watched the disciplined face of the doctor , so intent on his meal ; with contempt Appleby measured the clean lines of profile and of back which should have indicated civilized decency instead of brutality . And what kind of brutality was it anyhow ? " Dr. Forsyth , do you do a good deal of dog hunting ? " He could not conceal his scorn . ' I 'm no dog fancier at the best of times . " The doctor spoke evenly , his eyes and hands busy with the lobster carcass . " And right now I do n't mind telling you I 'd prefer shooting every dog in the district to having my hospital cluttered up with rabies cases . " " You mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month . " " They died ? " " I got one in time . The others came in too late . " " I see . " " So I 'm not going to have any more of them , Mr. Appleby . " The doctor took stock of the young man carefully  --  perfectly average height , color , stance , features . And the average voice went up a note or two : " You mean , doctor , you 've already shot every dog in the district ! " Be-MAGAZINE cause Appleby remembered now that , in fact , there had been no dogs rolling in the dust or fighting over fish heads at the pier . " No , we drowned the smaller ones . " This would have sounded like a bad joke or mockery at the other 's ingenuous excitement , except that the doctor spoke seriously , meanwhile folding his napkin and putting it neatly into a silver filigree ring . " If you 're interested , every two years there 's been an epidemic in this area . We 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no access by land to the villages above ; the jungle 's too thick . So it comes in at this port , or it lies dormant in the dog population . In either case , there simply wo n't be any dogs here from now on . " " And you 've really done that , killed them all , even in the Indian villages ? " Now he saw the man in another light , not merely a brute . He had observed the trim elegance of the house , a far cry from the usual habitations of bachelor officials along a tropical coast . He knew that only fanatic discipline could maintain cleanliness , much less luxury , in this wilting port . Then he said , " And did you get the people to co-operate in this crusade ? " " No , they did not . But does one expect co-operation from natives ? Does one expect them to understand one 's efforts in their behalf ? " His rhetorical questions were addressed to himself , and the eloquent diction marred by those lisped s 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should not be judged by the standards of the vulgar . His voice was not cruel ; simply there was no crack of a doubt in it . He was sure of his own uprightness . Here was a godlike creature , the beautiful profile , the well-kept hands . He must have been top man in sports and studies . How had he ever filtered down to this obscure post , a port so small that the airfield runways for the chicle planes nudged alongside the one block of stores and customs house and hospital , and the stubby finger of the pier , with the town latrine a wart on one side of it , pointed dispiritedly out at the hot blue Caribbean , from which nothing ever emerged to stop off except the moldy Sarah K and a few banana barges . Maybe this was the only place where Forsyth could still play God . Anyway , for Appleby that was beside the point ; what really mattered was what to do about Sabina . H E APPROACHED the matter cautiously from another angle ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , doctor , but now that you 've eliminated the carriers , ca n't you start out again , with inoculated dogs ? " " What are you trying to say , Appleby ? " " Well , my bitch has had her rabies shots , you know that . And I 'll go straight into the bush . I can pull out in thirty minutes . " " You missed the point , sir . True , I despise these natives , but I make every effort to be eminently just . If you think that I would permit a white man to take a dog , vaccinated or not , up country for mere companionship , after destroying dogs used there for hunting , for a livelihood however mean , you have a mistaken idea of my position here . " The Pomposity enraged Appleby . " I guess I do n't understand your position here , doctor . Are there no limits to your authority ? " Instantly he was sorry he had said it ; no use to antagonize him . Then watching Forsyth 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insult or a joke ; he simply took everything at face value . His soft , even voice answered in that vein . " Few limitations , Mr. Appleby , and I 've not countenanced the slightest insub-ordination . " There was a silence . Appleby decided to say nothing more , although he was thinking to himself , does the fellow look for words with s in them ? Apparently Forsyth took the silence to mean that the young man approved his autocracy , because he suddenly changed his manner altogether . " Forgive me for not asking you to sit down , Appleby . One never knows who is going to walk through the door in a place like this , but now that we understand each other , have some lunch ? Hot tea and a bit of lobster ? Quite good hollandaise my cook manages , although it 's lime instead of lemon of course . Gives it a different touch . " The young man did sit down , more from fatigue than for any other reason . " And if you 'll excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the boat . They ca n't start unloading until I clear her . They do n't like it much . Order is the thing hardest to get into these people . " Appleby thought absently that he had never found it so ; he had been able to get remarkably good native assistants . But then he knew them only as men whose help he needed , not as subjects to rule . He pricked up his ears ; the doctor was saying : " Tell you what I can do for you about your dog . In a few days the Sarah will be back on her way to Guatemala . You could have her sent over there until you get out of the bush . " " In the meantime ? " " That 's just it . I was going to suggest that you can put her under my house . There 's an observation cage . " He pointed through the floor as if the cage were directly beneath them . " I used it for a while before I decided the other was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . And feed her . You understand , " and now this astonishing man seemed to be carrying his conciliation to the point of apology , " I could n't possibly let her out , but in this case , good dog and so on . . . " " Very kind of you , " said Appleby awkwardly , " I really do n't want to accept such a favor from you , " which was perfectly true . He mistrusted this man wholeheartedly . Yet why should he ? He is morbidly scrupulous , thought Appleby ; eminently just , to use his own words . And what else could he do with Sabina ? He himself was due in Rio dc Dios immediately . He was on a heavy schedule . If the observation cage was operated half as efficiently as the house Sabina would be all right . His friends in Guatemala would take care of her when she got there . Meantime , a few days ' rest would n't hurt her . " The truth is , Dr. Forsyth , I have n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Quite all right . " " She may not be the pleasantest of guests , " Appleby continued . " I 'm afraid she 'll howl being shut up . You mention hunting . She 's a hunter herself . I got her from a policeman . She 's a Doberman . " " So you told me . " " Oh , did I ? Well , her trainer found her too high-strung for police work , but he 'd already given her the rudiments of man chase . " The doctor smiled , rather nicely Appleby thought , and he wondered if he had misjudged him . This pleasant thought warmed Appleby further to the subject of Sabina : " She 's a really great dog , doctor , and all the family I 've got . " He unfolded one of the doctor 's fine damask napkins , having decided he might as well have the tea . MHE doctor started to answer , some I casual , gentlemanly thing , and then stopped abruptly midway , and fell into a taut , listening silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning . " What 's that ? " Appleby 's voice was almost as hysterical as the canine cries , repeated , frantic , which had interrupted them . " Sabina , " whispered the doctor . He had already moved swiftly over to the stiff-backed desk , pulled down the writing shelf and was reaching inside . As Appleby ran past he saw papers finically pigeonholed , and he saw a revolver . " No , " he shouted from the door , " that 's not Sabina . It 's a smaller dog . " But he was in a panic , because he had not for an instant doubted that Forsyth had killed every dog in the district ; so this must be his Doberman terrified into these strangled , high yelps by some inhuman abuse . And now nothing stood between her and the fury of destruction , or order , whichever it was that beset this man . They got to the porch railing together . And there was a dog , tearing past the house and down the street , a yellow and brown mongrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each pair of legs in muscular spasm moving as one leg . And behind him ran a little negro boy . " Look out , you 'll kilt the child , " yelled Appleby , snatching at the arm which aimed the revolver so expertly . " Damn it . man , think I ca n't hit what I sight ? Now it 's too late . We 'll have to plow out after them . " MAGAZINE " What do you mean , them ? The boy 's not mad , is he ? " Appleby 's relief made him flippant . " It 's no joke . That dog can muck up the whole show . " " Yes , I suppose he can . " And Appleby laughed ; it was funny , if you wanted to look at it that way , the doctor 's perfect planning gone awry . " But how can you be sure he 's mad ? " " Impossible to mistake the gait . Here , you take this gun . get another . " Down the muddy wheel ruts Appleby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : terror of flight and of pursuit were fused into that small figure , the bound muscles impeding flow of movement but not impeding speed . The pitiability of puppydom was there , masked by this spastic grimace , a shuddering paroxysm rather than a gait . Everyone down the block had gone indoors on one wave ahead of the mad dog ; this matter was left to the doctor . So Appleby and he were alone together . " They 'll head for the bush beyond the flying field , " shouted Forsyth as he cut from his own driveway across the hospital yard and then behind the general store and through a marshy dump ground used by the storekeeper . The footprints of the little boy oozed up here . There was a pile of rotting bananas and some tins from which seeped gaseous tomatoes . Running in the heat , even that little way , had tired Appleby and he stopped there a minute , w rit the blood pounding in his head he thought , what are we chasing , dog or boy ? Because he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog but as one pursued by them . It 's because he 's afraid , thought Appleby ; nothing else could push those match-stick legs to such violent effort . I suppose this wretched little creature figures he 'll get the works from the doctor for having hidden his puppy . Well then , we are chasing the boy . Why the hell do n't I get out of this ? The doctor can take care of himself , that 's sure . So why do I go along with this gun in my hand ? But a little way ahead , in the flying field , the doctor was pointing dramatically and yelling , hardly winded , " See that stream ? You cut them off at the log ford . I 'll make for the bridge . They wo n't go into the water , sure of that . . . " And although the doctor 's grandiose manner seemed off key to Appleby , too epic for the little boy and the little dog and the little stage , still the young man found himself obeying those imperious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the log ford they made for . So both dog and boy were his quarry ! If they got across the brook and into the bush they might escape . But he was gaining on them , and now his heart was beating hard again , and with excitement , not merely exertion . That miserable mad thing in the lead , muscles of neck pulled back and legs jerking up and down , up and down , in one final spasm of ricocheting speed reached the ford , and crossed , and then began to zigzag . And the little boy , barefoot . gained distance over Appleby on the lichened , slippery logs of the crossing ; so that by the time the man 's shod feet got him over the chase was at an end , or almost . The dog had stopped in mid-flight ; feet still in motion he had fallen and rolled over onto his back under a wild fig tree . The boy was above him with a rock in his hand ; behind the child came the white man , absolute law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second of pity for the dying thing at his feet , or whether the sound of Appleby approaching paralyzed his arm , the boy was just too slow , and the clicking jaws of the puppy caught him on the leg . The doctor , running up too , released him by putting a bullet through the dog . And the child said nothing . When the dog 's jaws unclamped he fell backward , holding his leg by the knee and moving both legs as if he imagined he was still running . He looked out toward the jungle ; evidently he had had no intention of stopping here . Now he was stopped and the fear was as great as the pain . But the doctor had spent his wrath in the chase . He knelt down by the child and then he picked him up , not unkindly . " We 'll have to get him to the hospital at once . The only thing I can do is to cauterize . " " But you 'll give him serum . " " There is none . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but you . . " There were no words to meet the occasion . Appleby had simply not met a man as sure of himself : there were no more dogs , therefore no more serum was needed . The doctor was saying , " Why certainly , I sent the last batch up to the capital a week ago . There 's a standing order from the Chief M.O . ' s office to concentrate all excess drugs in the capital . " " You had the serum and you sent it away ? " " Look here . . . " But Appleby interrupted brusquely , " What will you do ? " Forsyth glanced at the young man , evidently put out by his violent tone . " Weil , there 's a plane today . send up and have some serum sent back , of course . What else is there to do ? It 'll be back in two weeks . " " Two weeks ? " Appleby could n't help looking at the child 's agonized face . " Not as good , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance , thought Appleby ; he 'll always be right . And he felt tired to death . Everything that had happened in this port of perfect justice , including the hunt , seemed now in retrospect terribly fatiguing , more than he could stand . He only wanted to get away , out into the bush where there was nothing more fearsome to encounter than tapirs and tigers . Even the idea of leaving Sabina was not as formidable as before ; she at least would be meeting the doctor on a physical , not metaphysical , level . Anything to get away . And it was quickly done , hiring mules , loading , settling the Doberman in her cage . With a deep sigh of joy and clean anticipation of the hard work ahead , Appleby woke up next morning beside one of those wonderful little bush rivers with which he was familiar , whose recondite beauty deep in the jungle 's heart suggested that in the human heart as well there must be these winding rills of peace if only they could be discovered . T WAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port . He was ready to leave , refreshed in mind from having done a job well , and confidently expected to get a ride out on a chicle plane that very day . So he could hardly believe that the usual infirmity of circumstance was going to keep him from leaving  --  and that Sabina was still in the cage . All air service , even freight , had been discontinued because of an accident and a government inquiry into maintenance and equipment . And the wheezy old Sarah K had simply got swamped in the ensuing congestion of goods and passengers ; Appleby had to accept the doctor 's statement that he had not been able to get Sabina aboard . But it was not until that evening , having a drink on the doctor 's porch , that he realized the full implications . It meant that airmail had been diverted to regular mail and that some of the regular mail had been sent along the coast by mule , that the rabies serum due two weeks before was even then plodding by animal along the valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been bitten was going to die , because the bite had been a bad one . He was going to die soon , maybe that night . The doctor had just told him these things , lispingly , softly , without emphasis or excuse or vindication . Up to then the young man had been able to isolate himself from the doctor 's world . Even with Sabina whining restlessly and steadily under their feet , Appleby had been able to deflect , against the armor of his own hard , sensible work just completed , the renewed impact of this man and his exquisite house and his exquisite blend of gin and bitters and his exquisite inhumanity ; but in the silence that followed the doctor 's words , Appleby saw that he was vulnerable again . He set his glass down an the floor beside his chair , quietly , carefully , not a drop spilled , and he told himself that he should have known better than accept this man 's hospitality , for himself or for Sabina , that he should have gone away that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that flight into the jungle and into his work had not been enough . The doctor was saying in his near-whisper , " You know , I am really too tired to get through this night . " " You 're tired ? What on earth has that got to do with it ? The child 's your responsibility , is n't he ? " " Yes , I suppose he is . But those damned lazy black nurses wo n't watch him . They 're afraid of him . I should go over at once . " " You 'd better go then . Do n't you have to administer sedatives ? Or are you all out of them too ? " He stood up . " If you 'll excuse me , I 'm going to put Sabina on her leash and give her a run on the beach . Where is the leash ? " He waited for the doctor to make his martinet objections to taking Sabina out , and he was ready to shove them back down his throat , choke him with the imbecile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , half stupidly , as if he might really have reached hopeless exhaustion , " Sabina ? Oh yes , her leash is just by the door on a nail . " And Appleby had turned to go , was feeling refreshed already in the nice prospect of a walk with his dog ; he had taken down the leash and was calling to Sabina from the steps , " All right , girl , quiet , you 'll have your run at last , " when that first sound came from the hospital across the street . A PLEBY stopped exactly where he was , did not even bring both feet onto one step . And he said to himself softly , but speaking out loud , " Yes , you might as well call it what it is , a child yelping . There 's an explanation . His throat muscles constrict and he 's trying to get air . But it sounds like a bark . It 's a child barking . You 're here and you have to hear it and it 's too late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen . " Immediately they came again , those rasping intakes of convulsive breath , too monstrous to have emerged from anything human , cast out into the muggy night , and hovering over the huts and over the viscous tepid waves and over the doctor 's house . The sound itself constricted , strangled , as if it , not the throat that made it , was bound round with closing muscles . The doctor had not moved either ; although unlike Appleby he must have heard something like this before , have known what to expect , because he was saying , " I told you I was too tired . And THE INNOCENT BYSTANDER there it is again , there it is . " For the first time he looked confused . There it was , indeed , again and again , until Appleby knew that if the doctor was going to stand there , he could not ; he had to go to the hospital and see if there was anything he could do . But at the gate Forsyth caught up with him and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road . And in that same moment the nightmare shadow of that first hunt took flesh ; a figure dashed out of the hospital compound ahead of them . This creature had the dog 's same obsessed run , and as it turned on to the road a gate light showed up the same strained neck muscles , and the teeth snapping and opening to emit the barks . They were in pursuit again , that much was certain . It was not until he felt the squash of earth in the dump lot behind the general store and smelled the garbage pile there that Appleby stopped . " I wo n't . I wo n't do this . " The doctor stopped too , and the fatigue that had ridden his face a few minutes before was gone . He spoke persuasively . " Look , Appleby , they 've all gone in . The cowardly beggars wo n't turn a hand to help us . We 've got to do it . " It was perfectly true that every house was shut and dark behind them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let the child alone . He 'll die but we ca n't chase him . We ca n't hunt him . " " If he meets someone ? A mahogany cutter coming in late . . . " " Well , we ca n't . " And the doctor answered lightly , always reasonably , " Very well , then it 's your dog . " " What ? " " Let her out of the cage . " Appleby looked at the slender , strong chain he still held in his hand . " Without her leash , " said the doctor gently . " Sabina ? " " Of course . Sabina . It 'll be over in a few seconds . Ca n't you see ? You said she
