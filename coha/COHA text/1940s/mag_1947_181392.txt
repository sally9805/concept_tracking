The best horses in the East were running at fashionable , old-fashioned Saratoga and at streamlined Garden State , but turfmen 's thoughts strayed elsewhere . At Rockingham Park at Salem , N.H. , under two circus tents , 43 emaciated thoroughbreds stood listlessly cooling their fevered noses in buckets of water . Their hind legs twitched ; some fell . By last weekend , seven of them had died , or been destroyed , because of a swamp fever epizootic ( animal equivalent of epidemic ) . The New Hampshire veterinary ordered every one of the 930 horses at Rockingham quarantined there indefinitely . <P> Swamp fever ( or equine infectious anemia ) was almost unknown in New England until last spring . It may have been brought in by an infected horse shipped from Florida . The infection had been spread presumably by blood-sucking insects . Cases began to pop up at various New England tracks , chiefly at Rockingham . <P> The disease attacks horses ' spleens , kidneys and livers . Veterinarians say there are likely to be relapses years after apparent recovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing career even if he survives . There is no known cure . <P> Some of the owners at Rockingham felt almost as sick as the sick horses . In many cases their feverish thoroughbreds were their entire working capital . A serious problem also faced the owners of healthy but quarantined horses . When the summer meeting at Rockingham ended last week , some 300 owners were left stranded - including scores of one-or two-horse owner-trainers who need purses to buy meat and potatoes . In an effort to give these horse-racing DPs a break , Rockingham Park got permission to open its fall meeting on Sept. 13 , three weeks ahead of schedule . <P> At Saratoga , owners of fancier horse flesh , worth $5,000,000 or more , were nervous if not panicky . Some 25 horses which had been vanned in from New England in the past month were checked twice a day . At week 's end Saratoga closed without a case of swamp fever ; but not until frost , said the vets , can horse owners in the northeastern U.S. breathe easily .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
