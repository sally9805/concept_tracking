Selective Service last week relaxed its teen-age draft , at the urging of U.S. educators , mothers and the kids themselves . Boys who entered high school before their 18th birthday will be deferred until 1 ) graduation , or 2 ) reaching 20 years-whichever comes first . Exception : those who cease to pursue their schooling " continuously and satisfactorily " ; the Army will get them fast if they do n't watch out .
