Today 's citizens love to ask themselves loaded questions-and then let bystanders pick up the pieces . Christians are no exception . One of their favorites is : " What is wrong with the Christian church today ? " Put to 100 clergymen and laymen ( mostly Protestant ) throughout the U.S. , this high-explosive question blew several Protestant tops . The current issue of Georgia 's semiannual South Today , edited by Paula Snelling and Lillian ( Strange Fruit ) Smith , tried to piece churchmen 's scattered replies ( they were speaking as individuals ) into a bill of particulars against the churches . Samples : <P> The Rev. Frank S. Persons II , Bastrop , La. : Church people " are worshipers of archaic patterns of thought . We have erected temples of the mind and enthroned on their altars certain banded-down ideas which we are as afraid to displace as any African tribesman his equally homemade and static wooden gods . " <P> The Rev. Eugene Smathers , Big Lick , Tenn. : " The greatest weakness of the church is its institutional self-centeredness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing its life in the service of men , it is gradually becoming impotent . " <P> The Rev. William E. Roach , Radford , Va. : " Ignorance is one of the greatest sins of the church . . . . Many of our ministers are 100 years behind the times . . . . They are preaching a personalized sort of righteousness which is ... not Christianity . " <P> Harold Ehrensperger , editor of the Motive , Nashville , Tenn. : " Too often church leaders are ugly , intolerant and unreasonable on minor vices because of their own starved lives . . . . They are oftentimes good because they have n't the courage to be bad . They are the masters of minor talents and the champions of inconsequential virtues . " <P> Prof. Manmatha Nath Chatterjee , Antioch College , Yellow Springs , Ohio : " If Christ were present today , He of course would have been put in jail . What would the church do ? It would say . . , ' We shall send a petition with 100,000 names on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean of Oklahoma School of Religion : " Many religious leaders are waiting for Jesus to come and put an end to the whole damned mess . When that happens they expect to be on the job to sing the doxology . . . . " <P> In ragged sum , these church critics seemed to feel that the church should shed its parochialism , actually practice brotherhood , instead of merely preaching it , and concern itself with human life rather than with doctrines . Dean John M. Atwood , of St. Lawrence University 's Theological School , Canton , N.Y. , summed up the Protestant unease : " Ministers and others seem to think that they qualify as religious when they make ascriptions of praise to God . . . and piously go through their devotions . . . . But their first and great purpose is not formally to glorify or serve God-which is always orthodox and safe - but to serve their fellow men in their need , even the least of them . . . .
