txt WASHINGTON , July 14 ? Clinton P. Anderson , Secretary of .. griculture , indicated on his return today from the Paris cereals conference that next year 's United States food relief shipments would not go to countries in the Russian orbit . The " two-worlds " split on cereals evidently took place during the conference . Attending were two Russian-orbit countries ? Czechoslovakia , to which the United State. : sent 118,000 tons of cereals last year , and Poland , to which 308,000 tons were sent . That Poland was asking for more United States grain shipments was evident from the fact that Mr. Anderson reported he sent a food mission there , as he did into all countries asking further shipments . No mission was sent to Czechoslovakia , which concluded a trade agreement with Russia covering cereals during the sessions . Mr. Anderson said he did not expect to send further United States grain there . " Russia has subtantial export quantities of grain , " Mr. Anderson reported , adding : " Where it will go we do n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he replied : ' ' We do not intend to ship grain into areas which are being supplied from other souces . " Secretary Anderson again emphasized that this country could not fill in Europe 's great deficit and predicted a " very difficult winter ahead . " He said the 50,000,000-ton export requirement estimate used in Paris was " not realistic " when compared with the United States ' 18,000,000-ton shipment this year . which he called " a whale of a lot " of grain . He said that 50,000,000 tons could not be found , could not be transported " now that priorities are off box-cars , " and could not be paid for . He estimated this country might ship as much next year as last . Asked if the short corn crop , as of July 1 prediction , would cut into next year 's food shipping plans , Secretary Anderson said he // chose rather to believe that the good growing weather since the report would bring the corn crop up . He said there were good chances that the next forecast on corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2,612 , - 000,000 bushels , which compares with last year 's crop of 3,285,000 , - 000 bushels . But , if the corn crop is short , export will come into competition with farmers wanting to feed wheat to chickens , he predicted . The department today announced that 1948-49 wheat production was wide open for farmers " in view of the world food situation , " with no 1 acreage allotments and no marketing quotas , Asked if the conference had accomplished what he had expected , Mr. Anderson replied it had at least " cleared the decks " so that nations saying that " we must look to the United States " would not come in next spring with the plea : " We had no idea you could n't take care of us . " " Now they know it is important to get collections in places where there are reasonably good crops , " he said . He mentioned , but would not name , a country that , he said , had estimated a 500,000-ton crop and expected to collect only 15,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost no consumer goods . " He added that , after flying over Germany and seeing its little strips of fields , he had realized . the German agriculture problem was " insoluble " and all that could be hoped for was stepping up production with fertilizer and filling in with imports , and therefore Pit is important to us that the level of industry be raised so that Germany will have something to export . " He said that , in the hope of breaking up the vicious circle keeping consumer goods from the German farmer and food from the coal miner , he had promised Gen. Lucius D. Clay 300,000 tons a month of cereal shipments to supply a 1,550-calory diet to German industrial centers . This will be done , he said , on the basis of new studies made by five groups , four under his direction : health and nutrition ; industrial production of food and fertilizer ; collection , rationing and consumption , and food import requirements . The fifth group , under the Secretary of Commerce , studied " payment for imports by exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be made for Britain , Italy and France , and all will go into a large and detailed report to President Truman , now being prepared . Questioned about " critical remarks " he was quoted as making on coal production in Britain , Mr. Anderson said : " When you see coal production low and you see what it means -- the importance of coal on account of fertilizer production  --  you point to that fact .
