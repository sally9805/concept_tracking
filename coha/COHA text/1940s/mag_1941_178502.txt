When a befogged , ice-winged airplane crashed into a French mountainside last week , Vichy 's wiry little No. 3 man , Minister of War General Charles Huntziger , 61 , was burned to death . He was returning from a three-week , 7,500-mile tour of Vichy 's North African colonies and , just before the crash , he heaved a full brief case out of the plane to safety . His reports might help Vichy to make up its mind about North African Commander in Chief General Maxime Weygand , whose resistance to Germany 's African designs has led to angry Nazi demands for his removal . <P> Charles Lon Clement Huntziger was a fine professional soldier from his cadet days at Saint-Cyr to his 1940 command of France 's Second Army , when he made a bitter-end stand against the Nazis at the Meuse . Marshal Ptain picked him , as a properly brave , dignified warrior , to sign the armistice with Germany in Compiegne forest . <P> Thereafter , like many French officers , General Huntziger seemed to be personally and politically opportunistic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successes against Adolf Hitler . Mme. Huntziger spent all last spring in Berlin , officially helping French war prisoners , a job which apparently obliged her to spend much of her time in the Hotel Adlon cocktail bar . <P> On the record , it did not seem last week that Vichy would have much trouble replacing General Huntziger . Likely successor : General Henri Ferdinand Dentz , onetime Commander in Chief in Syria , a good friend to the Axis .
