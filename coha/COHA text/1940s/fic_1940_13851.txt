NEAR the top of Red Rock Hill in San Francisco . Early afternoon of a summer day . Three boys . The colored boy , JEFFREY , is the oldest , about twelve , slim , good-looking , intelligent , and generous . Except for the light shade of chocolate of his complexion he would seem to be a white boy who had had the good luck to have been well-born . He is climbing the hill with his soap-box automobile , in order to coast down the hill to Parnassus Street and Seventh Avenue , about a mile . His soap-box automobile is built on the scale of a racer , painted bright red , and named Electric II . The other two boys are brothers , GEORGE and BENNY , who are nine and eight . Each of the brothers has a frame rig with two roller-skate wheels at each of the four ends . They have been talking as they come around the curve and pause for a rest . BENNY I 'm not tired , George . You said I 'd get tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a little tired . We 're not at the top yet , either , you know . Still about three blocks to go . GEORGE We 'll be racing down in a little while , though . Come on , let 's keep moving . JEFFREY Better rest a little . p. 3 BENNY George is always showing off . He 's all out of breath . GEORGE You be quiet , Benny . I let you come , so be quiet . BENNY Jeffrey let me come , did n't you , Jeffrey ? JEFFREY Three racing is better than two , just so you 're careful , Benny . BENNY I 'll be careful . GEORGE It sure is going to be a lot of fun coming around the curves , rolling down the hill . A whole mile without any intersections . JEFFREY We 're going to have a nice race . BENNY Is the watch working all right ? GEORGE ( Looking at the watch ) It 's ticking all right . BENNY What time is it now ? GEORGE Eleven minutes to three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , and maybe only five minutes to coast down . BENNY It looks like they made this street for coasting . JEFFREY Oh , automobiles pass over this highway once in a while . Sightseers mostly . They drive up the hill for the view . Over there 's the ocean . Over there 's The Golden Gate . You can see the bridge . See it ? p. 4 GEORGE Sure . There it is , Benny . The Golden Gate Bridge . JEFFREY And back there is the whole city . San Francisco . It 'll look even better when we 're coasting down . Now , do n't forget to be careful , Benny . BENNY I 'll be careful . JEFFREY Stay close to the curb . I do n't want you to get hurt or anything : Then Mrs. Stokely will say it 's my fault . GEORGE No , she wo n't . Ma do n't blame things on other people . JEFFREY I know she does n't , George . I just want Benny to be careful . We 're older , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . BENNY Nothing 's going to happen to me . I 'm just going to jump on my little coaster and when it 's time to start the race I 'm going to let her start rolling . How 'd you learn to make Electric Number Two , Jeffrey ? JEFFREY Electric the Second , Benny . I got the plans from a magazine . GEORGE Electric the Second looks just like a real racer . I 'll bet you leave me and Benny a mile behind , Jeffrey . JEFFREY A rig can go just as fast as a regular soap-box automobile . Maybe faster . p. 5 GEORGE Electric the Second won the Newsboys ' Race down Sacramento Hill last year , did n't it ? JEFFREY Sure , but this is n't Sacramento Hill . This is Red Rock Hill . BENNY I 'm going to win the race . I know I am . GEORGE You always say you 're going to win something , but you never do . BENNY I always want to . GEORGE Wanting to and winning are n't the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as old as you are , George , that 's all . Some day I 'll win . JEFFREY Maybe you 'll win today . GEORGE Maybe not , too . I know I 'll be second . And I know who 's going to be first . BENNY Who ? GEORGE Jeffrey , that 's who . Who ? You ? BENNY I guess maybe I can win , too . GEORGE If you reach Seventh Avenue and Parnassus before Jeffrey or me , then you win . But you 've got to do it first . ( JEFFREY is tightening a screw with his pocket-knife ) What 's the matter , Jeffrey ? p. 6 JEFFREY Nothing . Things always keep getting loose on one of these fancy jobs . They 're not like a rig that never gets out of order except when the wheels wear out . One of these things is always needing a little tightening . ( He closes the pocket-knife and puts it in his back pocket ) BENNY Let 's get to the top and start the race . GEORGE Somebody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Who ? You 're always getting scared . Who 'd you expect to come down the hill ? The King of England ? BENNY I was n't scared . JEFFREY You do get a little scared away up high like this . If I was up here alone I guess I 'd be honest-to-God scared . Not of people or anything , but just because it 's so high and you can see so much all around . The ocean . The Golden Gate . The city . The bay down there . BENNY You see , George ? GEORGE Well , that 's different . You were just scared . BENNY ( Looking ) Who is it ? GEORGE Nobody . Be quiet . He 'll come by and go on down the hill and we 'll go on up . p. 7 BENNY Here he comes . GEORGE All right , be still . Benny 's afraid of everybody . BENNY Only people . GEORGE Yeah , but you 're afraid of all of them . No matter who it is . Preachers , even . Sunday-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey . GEORGE Well , Jeffrey 's different . He 's a friend . BENNY He 's colored , too . Are n't you , Jeffrey ? JEFFREY Oh , that 's all right , Benny . You can say I 'm a nigger if nobody 's around . BENNY I would n't say it , Jeffrey . I do n't like people . I never know what they 're going to do . GEORGE You 're scared , that 's all . BENNY I 'm not scared . I just do n't like them . Do you , Jeffrey ? JEFFREY I like them sometimes , and then sometimes I do n't . BENNY Where is he ? GEORGE He 's coming around the curve . Maybe he stopped to look at the view . BENNY Well , I wish he 'd come and go . p. 8 GEORGE Here he comes . ( The boys become silent . THE MAN who appears is an ordinary-looking man of about thirty-four or thirty-five . He notices the boys and stops ) THE MAN Well . What 's this ? GEORGE Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's it to be  --  a race ? JEFFREY Not exactly . We just want to coast down . THE MAN What 's your name ? JEFFREY Jeffrey . THE MAN What 's your first name ? JEFFREY That 's my first name . ( THE MAN looks out toward the ocean . Without turning to the boys he speaks again ) THE MAN All right , what are you waiting for ? What 's your last name ? JEFFREY Samson . THE MAN ( Turning , speaking of the racer ) Is that yours ? JEFFREY Yes . THE MAN Did you make it ? JEFFREY Yes . p. 9 THE MAN How about letting me ride in it ? ( He turns toward The Golden Gate . There is a long pause . He lifts his voice suddenly ) I asked you a question ! ( BENNY goes to GEORGE and stands behind him . GEORGE goes to JEFFREY and stands behind him ) Answer me , nigger ! JEFFREY It 's not big enough for a man . THE MAN ( Turning ) What 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man . BENNY Do n't be calling him a nigger . THE MAN He 's a nigger , ai n't he ? BENNY Do n't be calling him a nigger . GEORGE Do n't be calling him names . ( THE MAN comes over to the boys . He pushes GEORGE down . Then he pushes BENNY down . He does n't touch JEFFREY ) BENNY I 'll kill you . ( THE MAN turns away from the boys and stares out at the ocean . JEFFREY brings his pocket-knife out , opens the blade , and stabs the man . THE MAN falls to his knees slowly without a sound . GEORGE leaps to his feet ) p. 10 GEORGE What are you doing , Jeffrey ? BENNY ( To THE MAN , crying ) I told you I 'd kill you ! ( JEFFREY stabs THE MAN again , while GEORGE tries to hold his hand . JEFFREY throws the knife away , and then picks up BENNY ) JEFFREY Do n't cry , Benny . ( They stand together over the dead man ) BENNY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race ? JEFFREY Stop crying , Benny . He has n't spoiled anything . Just forget that anybody came down the hill . Just forget it . ( To GEORGE ) I could n't help it , George . I just could n't help it . GEORGE Is he dead ? JEFFREY I guess so . ( Pause ) I hope so . ( Pause ) Yes , I hope so . He ought to be dead . BENNY ( Still sobbing a little ) I 'm glad he 's dead . GEORGE What are we going to do , Jeffrey ? JEFFREY What we started out to do . p. 11 BENNY ( Loudly , defiantly ) Sure . We 're going to race down the hill . GEORGE Supposing somebody comes by in a car and sees him ? JEFFREY I 'll drag him out of the way . ( He moves the body behind some plants which almost hide it ) Come on . GEORGE Are you going to tell anybody ? JEFFREY What 's there to tell ? BENNY Do n't tell anybody . GEORGE Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's forget anybody came down the hill . Let 's have the race . BENNY Sure . GEORGE All right . I wo n't tell anybody if you wo n't , Benny . BENNY I wo n't tell anybody , George . Honest I wo n't , Jeffrey . Come on . ( The boys stand silent a moment , looking at one another ) JEFFREY I just had to do it , Benny . He pushed you . ( He points ) Look at the ocean . BENNY You did n't do anything . Nobody came down the hill . p. 12 GEORGE We did n't see anybody . Let 's not go up to the top of the hill . Let 's start the race from here . JEFFREY We did n't see anybody , did we ? BENNY No . ( He gets on his rig ) Come on , Jeffrey . ( JEFFREY gets in his soap-box automobile ) Start us , George . GEORGE ( Looking at his watch ) All right . Get ready . I 'll call out fifteen seconds , ten seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Fifteen seconds . Ten seconds . Five seconds . Go . ( The rigs and the soap-box automobile begin rolling around the curve )
