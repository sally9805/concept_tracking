Eighteen years ago , on the eve of the U. S. Open at Skokie , stocky Gene Sarazen , a 20-year-old ex-caddy , calmly announced to his locker-roommates that he was going to win America 's No. i golf tournament . <P> He did-coming from behind with a breathtaking final-round 68 . Ten years later , at Fresh Meadow , Sarazen won the National Open again-playing the last 18 holes in 66 . Last week , on the eve of the 44th U. S. Open , held on Cleveland 's dog-tiring , wind-tricky Canterbury links , 38-year Oldster Sarazen , preparing to tee off in his 21st Open , made another prediction ; no golfer over 35 will ever win the Open . <P> Most golf fans agreed with him . Favorites among the 170 cream-of-the-crop golfers who qualified for last week 's tournament were : happy-go-lucky Jimmy Demaret ( winner of half the tournaments on the winter circuit ) , up- &-coming; little Ben Hogan ( who finished in the money in 16 tournaments this year ) , long-swatting Sam Snead , a mechanically perfect golfer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byron Nelson ( 1939 ) - none of them over 29 years old . <P> At the halfway mark , when the rain-harried field narrowed down to the 66 lowest scorers , Favorite Sam Snead led the parade along with lanky Horton Smith and bulky Lawson Little - all three tied at 141 for 36 holes . Snead , whose first-round 67 was the lowest opening-round score ever chalked up in the Open , attracted the largest gallery . Maybe this was the year , they figured , that he would outwhammy his famed spotlight jitters . <P> On the 36-hole final , Snead 's following thinned out . Word got round that Lawson Little , playing with the same mastery that won the U. S. and British Amateurs in 1934 and 1935 , was in the groove . <P> <P> Finishing with a last-round 73 for a 72-hole total of 287 , the broad-shouldered San Franciscan who had won only two major tournaments since turning pro four years ago , seemed to have his first Open wrapped up . Perhaps it was his previous experience over British seaside links that helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-notchers . <P> But , to his as well as the gallery 's surprise , he soon learned that Gene Sarazen , another veteran of British tournaments , was in the groove too . Nonchalantly plodding along on his piano legs , still wearing outmoded plus fours and using a 40-year-old putter , Oldster Sarazen , who was four strokes behind Little at the halfway mark , needed a two-under-par 34 on the last nine to catch Little . <P> In a stretch finish just as breath-taking as the one to which he treated his gallery at Skokie 18 years ago , Sarazen chalked up the 34 he needed , tied Lawson Little for the championship with a 72-hole total of 287 , - eight strokes better than Sam Snead , three strokes better than Hogan , Guldahl and Nelson . <P> Next day , in an 18-hole playoff , Sarazen was outplayed by Little , 73-10-70 . <P> Shaking hands with the new champion , Sarazen might well have said : " I told you so " Lawson Little is 29 . <P> <P> Were it not for a U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turn , this year 's Open would have ended in a triple tie , just as it did last year . Big Ed Oliver of Hornell , N. Y. , playing in his first Open , also posted 287 , was disqualified because he started a half hour before his scheduled time .
