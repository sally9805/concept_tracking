For Supermaniacs , whose wild devotion to their Man of Steel is a wacky U.S. phenomenon , radio had good news last week . They have devoured Superman in the comics , goggled at him in one-reel movies , have even got him on the air . But all they heard were transcribed programs . Now they can hear Superman in person on programs for which Manhattan 's WOR foots the bill . <P> Handsome , well-built Clayton ( " Bud " ) Collyer , 34 , who plays WOR 's Superman , stands six feet high , weighs 165 pounds . Though he lacks the original 's bulging muscles and jutting jaw , Supermaniacs who have met him in the flesh were not too rudely disillusioned . <P> In real life radio 's Superman is the father of three small children ( two girls and a boy ) , and superintendent of an interdenominational Sunday school at Manhasset , N.Y . Since he took over , the Sunday school 's attendance has increased from 700 to 1,250 . At first some children expected him to work miracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the real Superman-he merely plays him . Most embarrassing question Sunday-school pupils ask : Is there really a Superman ? Clayton 's sly answer : They will have to find that out from someone else . <P> Radio 's Superman must have a greater respect for rationalities than he has in comics or movies . Though he can still whiz through the air or break down a wall with his fist , he can push over no buildings , perform no miracles that sound can not easily convey . Clayton 's transformation from the scoop-seeking reporter , Clark Kent , to the mythical Man of Iron is accomplished by carefully deepening his voice and having all companions faint , while he slips on Superman clothes . Superman 's monologues must be cut to a minimum , suspense maintained by worrying listeners as to whether he will get to the rescue in time . The war has faced the program with another puzzler : Why has n't Superman joined the Army ? Most plausible answers : as Clark Kent , he could n't pass the physical exam ; and besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now does his bit by foiling Axis agents , rescuing troop trains and Clippers , smashing sabotage rings . As in the comics , Superman on the air is important to the United Nations-he is Secret Weapon No. 1 .
