Monsieur Verdoux ( United Artists ) , Charles Spencer Chaplin 's first film since The Great Dictator ( 1940 ) , is the story of a middle-aged French bank clerk who loses his job during a depression . Tenderly devoted to his invalid wife , his little boy , and their security , and disastrously ill-equipped to fend for them in a prolapsed economy , he nevertheless manages to set up in business for himself . The business : murder . <P> His victims are stupid , wealthy women . His difficult task is to woo them , marry them , pry their money loose , murder them , dispose of the corpses , and invest his take . He is exceedingly hardworking , skillful and , in his way , ethical at his job ; he takes the least possible emotional advantage of his victims , and he is careful to kill them painlessly . <P> He gets a certain esthetic pleasure out of his work , but on the whole it is distasteful and tiring ; whenever he can , which is all too rarely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lovely home his efforts secure . <P> Like many a man who drives a ruthless bargain , M. Verdoux has his good side . He exhibits an exquisite gentleness toward children , the sick and the maimed , and even the humblest animals . He spares one prospective victim ( a new Chaplin protege named Marilyn Nash ) , when he learns that she is the widow of a disabled war veteran and shares his burning pity for the helpless . He fails to close his deals with certain other clients too . He makes several brilliantly funny attempts on the life of rambunctious Martha Raye , but she was born lucky and is plainly indestructible . He nibbles interminably toward the heart and pocketbook of rich , socialite Widow Isobel Elsom-and is all but caught in his hazardous career as he is about to marry her . <P> Long after he has lost his family and , heartbroken , has retired from " business , " he does get caught . By this time he is firmly convinced that good &; evil are inextricably mingled-and has come to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Numbers Sanctify . " Chaplin has remarked that Verdoux paraphrases Clausewitz ' idea that the logical extension of diplomacy is war . Verdoux 's version : " The logical extension of business is murder . " War , he tells the court which condemns him , is merely a grandiose multiplication of the crime he is dying for . But wholesale murder is condoned by the state . " Numbers . . . " ( of killed men ) , he tells the fat-mouthed journalist who interviews him in his death cell , " numbers sanctify . " An earnest priest , his last offices rejected , murmurs solemnly , " May God have mercy on your soul . " " Why not ? " replies M. Verdoux . " After all , it belongs to Him " - and walks out to be guillotined , away from the camera , down that straight road where most Chaplin movies end . <P> Monsieur Verdoux has serious shortcomings , both as popular entertainment and as a work of art . But whatever its shortcomings , it is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture Chaplin ever made , but it is certainly the most fascinating .
