One strip was used promptly by British Second Tactical Air Command fighters . One Royal Air Force and one Belgian squadron patrolled the beach area until fuel ran low , landed at the emergency strip , refuled and set off on offensive patrol behind the battle zone . Our Fighters In Effective Action The United States fighter commands alone sent nearly 2,000 planes into the sky during the day .

The Eighth Air Force listed ten German planes shot down and twenty-one American planes missing and our Ninth Air Force announced at least ten of the enemy shot down and five United States planes missing . Marauders Do Strafing Job The crews of Marauders and Havocs described the beaches from which the battles have moved forward as " black with wrecked tanks and vehicles and dotted with bomb craters .

Some mediums , after hitting the road intersection at Falaise , twenty miles southeast of Caen , went down so low that one pilot said the crews were able to motion French civilians to get out of the way while they shot up German cars in the streets . In all these attacks every Marauder returned , although they flew into the very muzzles of German anti-aircraft guns . A noon attack was directed against enemy gun positions near Quineville , on the eastern coast of the Cherbourg Peninsula , and against a highway bridge at St. Saveur Le Compte , fifteen miles inland . Some Allied airmen early in the day bombed German concentrations in the Balleroy Woods , nine miles southwest of Bayeux on the road to St. Lo .
