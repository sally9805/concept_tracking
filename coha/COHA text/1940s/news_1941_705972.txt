txt A farm land boom  --  or at least a boomlet  --  is in the making . So far it is in its early stages . In the past feW months there has been a sharp increase in the turnover of farms . In some cases these sales have been at price levels prevailing for some time . In other instances sales ' prices have increased modestly ; some have run as high as 25% above a year ago . Two factors seem responsible : 1 . Sharply rising farm commodity prices , encouraged by Government-set " floors " . 2 . Fear of inflation . What Is the Outlook ? " If farm commodities continue to ' rise , " writes an Idaho banker , " it will result in greatly increased activity in the sale of farm land at much higher prices . " This is a typical answer which the American Bankers Association received to a questionnaire sent recently to a number of country bankers and farm leaders . Another banker  --  from Colorado  --  says : " lf the present price of grain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land values . " These and similar predictions are made on the basis of what is already happening . Insurance companies , which are also large lenders on farm land , confirm this situation . These insurance companies are generally taking advantage of this stepped-up demand for farms to lighten their burden of acreage acquired during the depression and drought periods of the 1930 's . The MetroPolitan Life Insurance Co. , which reluctantly became this country 's No. 1 farmer . during the 1930 's by taking over mortgaged laid , has sold more farms so far in 1941 than It : , did in all of ' 1940 . Sales already have aggregated $13,300,000 , versus , $13 million for all of 1940. - - Peak Holdings in 1938 1 ? Metropolitan , by the way , reached- peak - holditigs of about 433 million of . farm land ' at the end of 1938 . By the end of 1941 it is expected that these holdings of unsold farms will be less than $50 million with pretty close to . half of this three-year reduction coming during 1941 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales in recent months , too . The Northwestern* Mutual Life Insurance Co. ' s sales of farm lands so far this year have run about 20% ahead of last year . The Bankers Life Co. of Iowa sold 18,502 acres of Iowa farm land in the first nine months of 1941 . Who are buying these , farms ? An Iowa banker answers this question : " Farm real estate investment is made by two classes of people  --  operators and non-operators . A large portion of the operator investors consists of tenants who are finding it difficult to find rarnas to operate and who have accumulated enough money to make a down payment . They can not afford to pay more than the . farm will pay out . The non-operators , of course , are buying for investment , and possibly as a hedge against inflation . Generally speaking these buyers are paying down a substantial part of the purchase price . " That most buyers of farm lands are . either tenants who feel that they must buy , to be assured of a place to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand holdings is seen by tfie Greater North Dakota Association Aich recently surveyed the situation in that state and found sales for the first half of 1941 totaled 4,000 farms , compared with 7,000 for all of 1940 . They also found that " Practically all purchasers are men who know the land and can accurately rate its pro. , ductive worth . " " There appears to be little or no speculation , and nothing that can be likened to an undesirable old time land boom . " It is generally - agreed that much of the land purchased has been bought at considerably less than its actual value . " In some sections prices are higher than a year agO and will no doubt increase as sales continue and fewer desirable properties are offered for sale . " Good Buildings In Demand This North Dakota survey also discovered a demand for farms with good buildings on them , in view of the increased difficulty and cost of putting up new buildings . Absence of any real speculative movement in farm land as yet is pretty generally conceded . Glenn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and director of that company 's farm loan division , believes that there is practically no speculation in farm land today He believes , too , that the farm land situation is in the soundest condition right now that it has been in many years . This Metropolitan Life Insurance Co executive points to a Government estimate that 66% of the farms in this country are clear of debt . Of the mortgages on the remaining 34% of the farms almost half are held by individuals . Only about 12% of total farm mortgages are held by insurance companies and those are probably neld on less than 5% of the farms , according to Mr. Rogers . There are other sound features to the farm land situation , too . The Metropolitan ? Life Insurance Co. finds that more than 90% of buyers of farms these days are farmer-type purchasers . They are tenant farmers or investors either already in farming or familiar with farming . The Metropolitan is finding its mortgagees whittling down their principal at a much faster rate now . Many farmers in debt have come into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as the scheduled reduction in the principal of their mortgage . This tendency is noted elsewhere , too . Those bankers replying to the A.B.A. 's questionnaire were virtually unanimous in their forecast of higher farm prices . Most of them . however , added an " if " . That " a ? is a continuation of farm commodity prices at present levels , or a further increase . What About Farm Prices " Some typical answers by bankers on this qugstion  --  Please State Your Opinion of What May Be in the Offing as Far as Farm Prices Are Concerned  --  were made by bankers in the following states : Colorado ? " The price of land wile increase a little . However , do not look for any boom prices such as were experienced during and after the last World War . Tendency is to buy land rather than to rent . This has forced many tenants to buy land in order to stay in the territory . " - - Illlnois --  " Strice the prices on livestock and farm crops have materially advanced we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve in our locality . " Indiana ? " If the price of farm commodities keeps on increasing for some considerable time , at the rate at which they are now increasing , there might be some increase in farm prices as a result of such a price level . In the territory to the west of us there is some increase in farm land prices and the tendency seems to be moving in this direction , but just how far east it may move and to what extent it may affect prices nobody , in our opinion , can predict at the present time . The real farmer is going to keep his feet very close to the ground during this present experience because of what be remembers from a few years ago . " Iowa ? " Very evident that people are becoming much more real estate minded . Tendency will be toward higher prices , especially unless inflation tendencies are strongly checked . " Pennsylvania. ? " Some inquiries from city folks in connection with farm property  --  farm purchase as a means of establishing themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota ? " Very decided tendency toward inflation of land prices . People from other states , or the western part of this state . come into territory where crops are good and purchase a farm on a long time basis price arrangement , and dislodge a very good renter . Renter in turn tries to find a farm and in turn Is forced into buying one on a long time basis , which in turn puts off another one and soon desirable farms are more difficult to obtain . Naturally the price goes up . " Tennessee ? " Farm lands have a right to command a fair market now , though not at fancy prices in en area like this one where values must be based on productive ability . If inflation becomes more of a reality , as we fear . it will promote the ownership of farm lands more than any other influence except high prices for farm products . " Texas ? " Farm prices will increase mate- rially , say 10% to 20% more , if the crop that we now have in sight materializes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased demand will grow larger and larger and will undoubtedly have its effect on future prices for farm lands . " Wisconsin ? " With farm prices holding as they are at present , it will be possible to interest the younger generation in the occupation of farming as a career . By getting more interest from the younger people , a greater demand should arise for farm land . " Kansas ? " owing to marked increases recently in the prices of farm products and growing apprehension about inflations , it seems probable that farm land prices may increase still further unless a ' price ceiling ' of some sort is established . " Minnesota ? " People seem to be more landminded . Big demand for five and 10 acre tracts with buildings Farms for rent are very scarce and have been the past three years . People fear inflation . " - Nebraska --  " Trend is upward and land values will strengthen if farm prices hold over a , year or so . Immediate outlook indicates a runaway market in farm land prices . for farms are Bontn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many farmers regard the farm commodity price structure as temporary . " Ohio --  " Indications are that there will be an increase in sale values per acre . The greater the prices of farm products the greater land sale prices per acre will advance . " Northezvetti ern Mutual MILWAUKEE  --  Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. ' s sale of farms so far this year is running 20% ahead of the corresponding period of 1940 . These sales are at prices which currently are 10% higher . So far in 1941 the company has sold about 500 farms , having a. value of about $5 million , or roughly 22% of the company 's portfolio of farms at the beginning of the year . It was reported that September sales were the largest for any month in the last decade and that prices are progressively improved . At present these prices are termed to be around " normal values " ? which is described as meaning 1909-14 parity . Northwestern Mutual 's farms are located in 17 states , principally in the corn belt . According to the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already land owners , with 75% of the total being farmers who are either adding to their holdings or purchasing farms for their sons . Some city people are reporting buying farm land to diversify their investments , asan inflation hedge . or to acquire property they can put money into by developing it , while at the same time providing themselves with a tax deduction . Panne and investors are said to be buying high grade land while speculators are taking lower grade farms as a secculation , since a small rise in acreage prices will mean a large percentage increase in investment . Northwestern Mutual demands a 20% down payment on all property with amortisation of the principal at a 3% annual rate . However , a number of buyers are either paying a third or a half of ' the principal as a down payment while a few are paying the entire sum .
