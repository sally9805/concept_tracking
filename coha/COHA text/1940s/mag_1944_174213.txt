Labeled Portrait of an Officer , Artist Unknown , it looked like a good , average , 18th-Century antique wall-piece , the kind that lends hints of lineage to a paneled drawing room . Bailey Stanton , Chicago lawyer and amateur art collector , liked it enough to buy it at auction-for $127.50 . <P> One day Collector Stanton showed his Officer to Dr. Maurice Goldblatt , director of the University of Notre Dame art galleries . " My God , you 've got something there , " said Dr. Goldblatt , who once helped the Louvre authenticate its famed Mona Lisa . He was , in fact , " 90% sure it was a Trumbull " ( John Trumbull , 18th-Century American historical painter and portraitist ) . Later he raised his assurance to 100% . And it was probably a portrait of Lafayette . <P> Dr. Goldblatt 's case : 1 ) Trumbull and Lafayette were friends and fellow officers in the American Army during the Revolution ; 2 ) from known movements of Lafayette and Trumbull , the Officer must have been painted after Trumbull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on forehead and hair which distinctly imitates a style of English Portraitist Thomas Gainsborough , who was showing in London at the time ; 3 ) typical Trumbull traits in the Officer are straight-line highlights on buttons , the peculiar method of coloring the rectangular collar of the uniform . <P> Collector Stanton and Authority Goldblatt think the Officer is a better Trumbull than the famed Alexander Hamilton now in the National Gallery in Washington .
