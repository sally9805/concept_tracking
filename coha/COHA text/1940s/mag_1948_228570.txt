Opposite Manhattan 's topless towers , on Hoboken 's Fifth Street Pier , the tightly phalanxed crowd was as agitated as an Agnes de Mille ballet , and every bit as chic . Before backdrops of exquisite luggage moved exquisite figures-Katharine Hepburn the actress , the Marquis and Marquise de Cuevas of the international set , and " Mile . Cin-Revue , " the Belgian beauty queen ( not to mention a sprinkling of ambassadors and two Marshall Plan emissaries ) . Also present were Mr. Hamish MacGregor , Mr. S. Wodowski , Mrs. A. Haggerty . Many passengers received , instead of steamer baskets , food parcels for their friends in the Old Country . <P> In the melee , superbly hatted and slightly perspiring heads bobbed and nodded with visions of what lay ahead-the Continent of bad plumbing , charm , great ruins , inflation , cancan and the cutest little French restaurant just around the corner . There were some references to crisis and even war . " My dear , " said a woman in dark sunglasses , " I do think you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way again-that great annual pilgrimage which almost since the Revolution has led Americans back to Europe at the command of fashion , war or undefined nostalgia . Well over 200,000 Americans were expected to go to Europe this summer , nearly on a par with the best prewar years , and as many as the reduced Atlantic fleet could carry . Ships of all sizes and registries were booked to capacity , and on the vastly expanded airlines space was going fast . Europe feverishly offered up its beauties in exchange for dollars , announced special rations to keep well-fed Americans well fed , and promised with a slightly wrinkled leer that all would be as gay as ever . <P> Most of the pilgrims indeed looked for gaiety-or for that vague value , romance ( of which Americans never seem to get enough at home ) . Some were going , as Emerson put it , " to learn what man can " - to be humbled or inspired by a culture of which their own was part and product . Some went in search of clarity in a confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their father 's house . <P> What would the pilgrims find ? <P> What they will find on the ravaged Continent is beauty , and , startlingly , peace . Not peace in the pitched battle for Europe 's faith and allegiance , nor peace in the daily battle for bread and hope , but the kind of peace that happens simply because life must continue . From the Clyde to the Tiber , the face of Europe is still scarred , yet these new scars-like the older ones at Athens , Rome and Nimes-are becoming part of Europe 's peace . Europeans have learned long ago that the danger which always threatens even their stoutest cities and their most cherished lands is not the result of any particular calamity , but man 's permanent calamity on earth .
