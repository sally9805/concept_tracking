While their leader secluded himself in cold , lonely Kuling last winter , the Chinese people knew only that he was meditating on China 's fate . Last week , China and the world learned of the decision Chiang had reached . In an effort to lead China farther along the road to democracy , Chiang Kai-shek would relinquish the presidency of his country . <P> " Not Ordinary Practice . " In the old-fashioned auditorium in Nanking 's Kuomintang compound , 300 members of the party 's executive committee convened . Their purpose : to nominate a presidential and vice presidential candidate for election this month by the National Assembly . It seemed a foregone conclusion that Chiang would be the candidate for the presidency . The Generalissimo , who presided over the meeting , looked more solemn than usual . Mme. Chiang was in the audience . Then Chiang rose and began to speak , slowly and carefully . <P> " Let me tell you , my dear comrades , " he said , " that never since I joined the revolution have I been called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contributions we made during the northern expedition and the war of resistance , the foundation of the republic has been greatly strengthened . The idea of democracy has become a popular sentiment . In these circumstances our party does not need to keep the post and honor of the presidency . . . . We can entrust to a person outside the party the grave responsibility of making the constitution a living thing . Only in this manner shall we rally the support of the people . . . . <P> " As long as the nation remains disunited I am determined not to run for the presidency .. . . This is not mere modesty . It is my sincere conviction . " <P> His listeners were literally stunned to silence . In the stillness , Chiang spoke again : " I know that for the party to choose a nonpartisan as a presidential candidate is not ordinary practice in democratic party politics . But it should not harm us to try it . Remember this is all a great experiment for us in constitutional democracy . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committeeman after committeeman urged Chiang to stay at the helm . But Chiang remained adamant . Gradually , it became plain that his move was an effort to show the civil war in a clearer light . The Communists present it as a struggle between two parties . Chiang sees it as a conflict between the Reds on one side and China 's national life and culture on the other . Explaining the qualifications of China 's next President , Chiang said : " The President must have a profound understanding of our history , culture and national traditions . It is evident that the Communists are determined to undermine the very existence of our country . " <P> These words pointed clearly to Dr. Hu Shih , one of China 's greatest educators , who is not a member of the Kuomintang and who has recently advocated uncompromising resistance to Communism . Chiang would probably stay on as head of the army and perhaps as Premier . But he clearly meant to guide the Chinese people away from their reliance on one-man leadership . Said he : " Whoever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my strength . I will prove to the people that I am a loyal public servant . "
