To the Germans now , each week of war was a week of reprieve . Every inch of ground held now was a mile of hope for a miracle , every day was a victory on the bloody march to April . By April there might be a number of strong new divisons-built around a new class of 17-year-olds nurtured on Nazi fanaticism . In April ( by Allied guess ) new Nazi secret weapons might be ready . <P> Last week the Germans were as good as ever at fighting for time . In the west they burrowed like moles , worked like beavers to dam the stream of Allied power swelling up to spill out over them . In the east they had limited for at least one more precious week the scythe-like swing of the Red Army . <P> But time still worked two ways . The Germans could not slow its speedy passage on Allied wings , in the fleets of thousands of bombers that could now take up even direct tactical support jobs for the Russians . In the multi-miled echelons of aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been joined in the sky . <P> The German command did not need a Yalta communiqu to know that the Allies had chosen the place-and probably the time-for the fourth and final ground front : the north German plain . There , perhaps in conjunction with landings from the North Sea , the eastern and western Allies had the same objective : to grind the Wehrmacht between them . <P> It was time for vitriolic German threats . Exhorted the Nazi Foreign Office spokesman : " Kill , murder and poison . . . cast overboard our last scruples . " Perhaps the Nazi leadership , in the last ditch of desperation , would order gas or bacteriological warfare . But if the threat was another bluff , it was quickly called . SHAEF let the thing be said that had long been evident but unlabeled : that terror bombing of German cities was deliberate military policy . The German command could easily read between the lines an Allied warning : if you do , we do .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
