The Germans did their best along the western front . Everything considered , their best was good-and the weather helped them out by being thoroughly bad . The Germans struck smartly , swiftly , skillfully , sometimes recklessly to buy a little more time , stalemate the front until winter comes . <P> For two weeks the Germans had achieved stalemate-of a kind . Pressed back by the contracting geometry of strategy to a greatly narrowed area of action ( see map ) , they could and did mass some of the largest concentrations of guns yet seen in the west . Behind their West Wall they had also recovered some measure of freedom to maneuver their forces ( but those forces were still a hodgepodge of first-raters and recapped seconds ) . <P> If Only- . The Germans knew of the great weight of Allied power gathering in front of them , all along the 460-mile front . But they could not know its full weight as it grew by the hour , despite the best the Germans could do , despite the worst of weather and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of balance . If only they could prevent the gathering of force at the most dangerous spots . If only they could pierce through the wedge north of Aachen that threatened their most vulnerable point-where a narrow thrust had been driven toward the end of the West Wall above Nijmegen . <P> The Germans tried to hold back the weight of Lieut . General Courtney Hicks Hodges ' U.S. First Army in the Aachen sector . They threw in flame-spouting tanks in three fierce attacks . But the Americans stood . <P> The Germans tried to stall the widening northward advance of the British Second Army . The British held . <P> This week the pent-up bolt of Allied power struck . A thunderous preparation by 1,000 bombing planes shook the earth for miles around a new sector northeast of Aachen . Behind the bombardment - and a rolling barrage by 10-inch guns - the battle-seasoned U.S. First hurdled a small river , moved forward toward Cologne . The Germans backed stubbornly , foot by foot , before them . <P> Only the First . The first blow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , stop it . But the fortnight of stalemate had clearly demonstrated this fact : the air-powerless Germans could do little to forestall similar blows wherever , whenever the Allies might choose to unleash them . <P> The enemy knew that more blows like it were soon to be unleashed . They warned themselves of " grand-scale attacks " on Lieut . General George S. Patton Jr . ' s front . There the enemy had been given a foretaste : the hillside forts above Metz have been given preliminary dive bombings ; 300 U.S. planes had given heavy tactical support . In the Nancy sector Patton 's Third Army in four days had added more than 130 tanks ( the equipment of a Panzer division ) to its bag of 200 the week before .
