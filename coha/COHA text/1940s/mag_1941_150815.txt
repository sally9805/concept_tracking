Next week a frustrated soap-opera character will have the dubious distinction of turning up in two lathery melodramas at the same time . His script name is Michael West ( played by Actor Joe Julian ) , gimpy-legged lover of Big Sister , a radio do-gooder of note . So attractive did Lever Bros . ( Lux , Rinso , Swan ) find Mike , whose love for Big Sister is not reciprocated save in a highly platonic way , that they decided to give him a program of his own , tentatively entitled Bright Horizon ; The Story of Michael West . <P> The new program will concern itself chiefly with Mike 's efforts to rehabilitate the erring brother of Carol , a girl of good family for whom he has a spiritual admiration . Michael will also remain in Big Sister 's show while starring in his own until he can be gracefully written out . Meanwhile Big Sister ( Actress Alice Frost ) will participate in a couple of Michael 's programs , more or less to show him around .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
