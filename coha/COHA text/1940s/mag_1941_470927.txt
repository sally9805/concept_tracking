Tilsit imperialism , like every other brand of imperialism , has been predatory . There is no point in arguing about this ; it is a historic fact . What troubles conscientious democrats to-day is the awareness that the traces of undemocratic rule still linger on in many parts of the Empire ; that Britain 's administrators have not always taken advantage of the opportunity to give their " colonials " the freedom that Englishmen enjoy at home . Exploitation , in the word 's most realistic sense , is still rampant in many lands under the British flag , where colonial officers and colonial merchants seem to form an unholy alliance , giving the natives no chance . It is easy to see those sore spots , easy to arrive at a quick verdict . But there is another side to this picture . Let us look at the Empire from another point of view ? let us analyze that complex and quite amazing specimen , the colonial Englishman . He is responsible for the fact that Britain 's Empire still exists . When Hitler brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Half a billion natives would revolt , the imperial structure would crack and collapse , and the victors would have no trouble stepping in where Englishmen had vanished . But he was wrong . Britain 's Empire , intact , majestic , and undisturbed , still stands ? the greatest miracle of our time . Out of every four human beings on this planet one owes allegiance to the British flag . The vast tablelands of Africa , the deserts of Arabia , the white cities and thedeep-green jungles of India are effectively controlled by a small mobile army of men from Britain , numbering hardly more than a hundred thousand , counting both the tropical worsteds and the khaki uniforms . How is it done ? It is not done with mirrors . I have followed the Union Jack around the Seven Seas , have listened to the tick of that colossal machinery that keeps on moving quietly even now while England fights for her life ; and I know that what keeps it moving is the quality of the Englishman abroad . I have found him well brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above all , he is a gentleman . Running the Empire , in peace or at war , is a gentleman 's job . It is still the most glamorous career Great Britain can offer . While our youngsters are daydreaming of U. S.

It is merely a sample collection of questions asked last year in the examinations that young Britons have to pass if they want to go out to run the British Empire . Year after year such well-trained young men leave London by ship or plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the four corners of the earth . They go to practice what they have learned and they go to practice the thing that is in their blood : that amazing ability to rule . There are thirty-eight crown colonies to be ruled by such bright young men . There is India , the largest single unit in the British realm , and an administrative unit by itself ? outside the sphere of the colonial office , but ruled by bright young men just the same . Let us observe the colonial Englishman in his crown colonies and in his India . It is there , not in the democratic , self-ruling white dominions , that the colonial Englishman has to deal with the vast and multicolored population which still lives under varying forms of disenfranchisement . It is there that he , a representative of a free nation , has to live with essentially undemocratic institutions . His personality then has to make up for the parasitism which still slows down the free flight of democracy throughout the British world . On an outward bound P. &; 0 . liner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered those tricky examination questions and who was en route to his first assignment ? in Tanganyika . He sat in his deck chair smoking his briar pipe . Appeasement was still in the air and war seemed a long way off . " Looking forward to the job ? " I asked . " Sounds like a bit of a hole , " he said cheerfully and he handed me a little book with the imprint of His Majesty 's Stationery Office . There under " Tanganyika " it said : " Prolonged residence in the coastal zone tends to result in a gradual deterioration in mental and physical energy . . the best type of individual is one possessed of an even temper , who takes a cheerful outlook on life and is not easily disturbed by reverses . Those subject to fits of depression , violent temper , nervous and unbalanced types , are unsuitable for the tropics . " I took a look at my friend and imagined him in his " hole " ? stalking about inmosquito boots , sweltering at night under a government-provided mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be boiled before he could drink it , attempting to thrive on a diet of fruit , green vegetables , milk , and eggs , wearing dark goggles and a tali , watching for tsetse flies and spirillum ticks and , in his spare time , administering his section of the Empire . An even temper indeed was needed for the job . " Really , you can not kick a coolie any more these days and get away with it , " said my friend Llewellyn Thorpe once with uncommon frankness . " If you do he is liable to say ' Just a moment , master , ' and return with a policeman . Every fez-covered dirty little buggy driver in India knows to-day that he is a human being ? a human being with a vote . He knows that this vote puts some of his countrymen into high places where they can meet the white man on equal terms . And although he will put up with a lot , from sheer tradition and friendliness , he wo n't stand for maltreatment . " Mr. Thorpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I always admired his detachment : he could discourse on the problems of India as if he had nothing whatever to do with them . Although it is difficult to go through India ( which is at war not as an ally but as part of Britain ) without thinking of the astounding cruelty with which it was conquered for the British raj , it is evident that by now the old-time " conqueror " has disappeared . Both the military and the civil servants whom I have met measure up to the standard of the British gentleman : Make no parade of courage ? it should be presupposed ; let your enemy mistake calmness for cowardice ; be an amateur when it comes to money ; be quick to acknowledge your errors . The business of ordering people about no doubt is serious . Whether they are black Africans or bronzed Malays or dark yellow Chinese ? you give your order and they take it silently . There is no comeback , and unless a man is a gentleman it is likely to do something ugly to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter , Americans . Careful breeding and careful selection qualify them for the job , and so strong is the imprint of their gentlemanly training that they often seem smothered under it . But underneath that suave and sometimes effeminate-seeming exterior you may have occasion to discover that they are tough ? tougher than English mutton chops . Sitting with me on the porch of his bungalow , overlooking the lush park where wild cockatoos were making little noises , where a dark turbaned gardener was busying himself on the well-clipped lawns , Mr. Cecil , Irvine indulged in a bit of philosophy . " Co-operation , " he said , " is going to save the Empire " ( he said " Empaahr " ) . While he talked , sipping his tea , he paused now and then to take a silk handkerchief out of the sleeve of his white jacket , mop his brow , and put the handkerchief back into the sleeve . " Governing India by force , " he said , " is ridiculous . We could n't hold it for two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes in the park before us interrupted him . It was the turbaned Hindu gardener who suddenly yelled like a wounded animal , dropped his rake and came running with a face that was horror-stricken . " Cobra , " he shouted . He stopped , trembling with fear . Thereupon Mr. Irvine performed the most interesting act I have ever been privileged to witness . Slowly he got up , walked toward the spot where the gardener had spied the snake and , with a sudden jerk , bent down . He grasped the snake between his fingers , pinching it behind its head . Presently , with a jolt of his arm , he broke it ? using a twist that killed it by dislodging its vertebrae . Then , as if he had done nothing more spectacular than lighting a cigarette , he threw the limp rope of a dead snake into the bush and came back , using his silk handkerchief with languid grace . " Damn ' nuisance , those snakes , " he said . " Poisonous , y'know . " The Englishwoman abroad does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the humdrum routine of a colonial existence which does not give her much fun . In her tailored linen suit she goes to meet the other ladies for a game of backgammon or mah-jongg or for a knitting party in the morning . She soon learns that she can not wear white silk because it washes yellow , or georgette because it splits . She seldom complains : if her husband flies home by Imperial Airways she does not mind following him in the second-class stateroom of a slow steamer . Without complaint she takes care of a Hindu urchin who has been bitten by a mad dog and who staggers to her house ? because there is no hospital near enough . Without complaint she will look under the bed before retiring , expecting anything from a snake to an Afridi tribesman to be hiding there . She has a host of servants at her command and she has to make them do the work ? whether she wants to bake the cake herself or not . Woe to the English lady who stoops to do part of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in the midst of an irreparable mess , left to drift through kitchen and pantry without guidance , and without any authority whatsoever . The American-born ( and Vassar-graduated ) wife of a colonial Englishman had her own slant on this perplexing problem . " It 's not so much the servants as the English husbands , " she said , " who make it prohibitive to touch anything that looks like housework . Why , one day shortly after we had first come out I prepared breakfast for my husband . And what do you think he did ? First thing I knew he gave me his shoes to shine ! " In some of the African colonies the climate is so devilish that the Government frankly discourages the taking along of white women . Officers going to the Gold Coast are officially advised " not to bring out their wives until they have themselves seen the conditions of living or until they have consulted some woman who has had previous residence .

No , sir , you ca n't have three women out there and still be happy . Matter of fact , with the climate what it is and with nothing else to do , I do n't blame the ladies for getting restless . " But the lone Englishman in the tropics who enjoys an American movie once in a while is greatly intrigued and stimulated by the dashing young woman of the Ann Sheridan type sauntering through the bush in cute little shorts , her glamorous make-up impervious to the indelicacies of a hellish climate . And , when the show is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no escape , he prays that nothing may ever happen to blight the imagination of Hollywood producers . II The British Empire is run by gentlemen ? not by brutes , bon vivents , or bishops . If this is the first secret of empire , the principle of government by mirage is the second . In the vast subcontinent of India , which holds three-quarters of the Empire 's population , British rule is as elusive as the little man who was n't there ? now you sec it , now you do n't . It was an early landing , shortly before sunrise , and we were steaming into port when I went up on deck to have my first look at Bombay . There it was , looking as if it had crawled out of this boiling ocean , alive and quivering , and not beautiful , with domes and spires whiteand gray . Above it , in a strawberry sky , black birds of prey were drawing quiet circles . Then we dropped anchor , and coolies with red turbans and with matches instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presently the whitest sun rose above the horizon , the heat became oppressive , and I remember that I felt fear as I walked down the gangplank into a smelling , yelling , cataclysmic riot of a town . Pushing my way through filthy streets that seemed to simmer in this blistering heat , my ears humming with the absurd chirping of a thousand foreign tongues , my eyes dazzled by strange new shades of yellow , red , and blue , I smelled and saw and heard the matchless monstrosity that is India . Street cars rumbled by filled with clusters of fez- or turban-covered scrambling humanity , limpid animal eyes that belonged to white cows or dark people stared past me , and the bare feet of men and women stamped stolidly through the yellow dust . India roared past me and neither cows nor men nor women would focus those limpid eyes on me , the stranger . Then suddenly I saw the mirage ? as one sees a deep-blue lake and palm trees rise out of a desert . There it was : the shimmering fa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool lobby I beheld white faces , cigarettes , lapels ? Englishmen and English women lingering over whiskey sodas , newspapers that had no front page , and seven-course of ins . There was no heat , and not a single white cow was lying across my path . And I expected the mirage to dissolve into thin air any minute . But it did n't , and I saw more of them as I went deeper into India . You can travel through the red-hot countryside for days without ever encountering a white face until suddenly the mirage rises out of the mist again , a strangely comforting sight . And three hundred and fifty million people , from Kashmir down to Cape Comorin , bow to seventy thousand white men who live in air-conditioned solitude , who are everywhere because they are nowhere , whom you can see but not touch . Quietly they move in their cars from home to office to club to home , and they complete that circle without running afoul of a world they never made : the hot and strange world of barren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not mingle with those who were here first , they do not admit them to their clubs and houses , they do not meet them except on business . It is the British idea of power ? floating power . Where Spaniards proselytize , where Frenchmen freely mingle , where Americans teach and uplift , Englishmen stay aloof ? and rule . The conquering English recognized long ago that it would be impossible to put the white man on top of India 's endless social /adder ? into a separate super caste , as it were . The British official who sat in his office could never expect to outshine those native noblemen who came to see him with elephants and white horses , bringing their servants and dancing girls , dressed in brocade and covered with jewels . The British official could be different ? he could n't be higher . " You see , " a British civil servant explained to me in Bombay , " the people of India have been used to the mysterious antics of their own rulers , the rajahs . This is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact , it is a mutual feeling about the other fellow 's being endowed with mysterious qualities . Most of us Englishmen actually believe that there is such a thing as the Indian rope trick ? you know : a boy climbing up an unsupported rope , and disappearing when he 's got to the top . We believe the fantastic story of the magician whose performance was scheduled for six o'clock , and who did not show up until six-thirty . ' Ladies and gentlemen , ' he said . ' Just look at your watches . It is only six o'clock . ' And , by Jove , it was . " He cleared his throat . He , of course , did not believe in the mysterious qualities of his three hundred and fifty million neighbors . Much of what he said , however , was confirmed by my friend Domodar , a Hindu dentist up in Kathiawar , and a member of Mr. Gandhi 's Congress Party . " The Englishman goes out to run his Empire without a superiority complex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is superior : he knows . And that makes all the difference in the world . Why bother to prove your superiority if its presence is an indisputable fact ? Anybody who is not an Englishman is so utterly different , so distinctly inferior , that no Englishman would ever attempt to make a point of it . " " Do n't you find such arrogance annoying ? " I asked . " Not in the least . Those convenient blanks in the Englishman 's mind make it much easier to get along with him . You see , most of us colored races have developed over a period of centuries a sacred tradition of hospitality . The Englishman , who can not eat our food , who does n't know our customs , who is n't very well equipped to stand our climate , is a stranger here . He enjoys the privilege of our hospitality whether he likes it or not . As our ruler he is exposed to our hearty disapproval . As our guest he is an object of both pity and respect . " Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India and elsewhere , who would like nothing better than see the British clear out of his country to-day , will go out of his way to bring his English oppressor a warm coat or a cool drink . " The funny thing about our so-called revolution , " said Damodar , " is that it is directed by English gentlemen with an Oxford accent . They are Hindus only by race . Otherwise they are British lawyers who have returned from London 's Inner Temple to run the Indian Revolution . They know the British mind , they fight England with its own weapons . But they are closer to the English hierarchy than they would admit . They are frustrated Englishmen . " " Would you call Mr. Gandhi a frustrated Englishman ? " I said , recalling his successful career as a lawyer . Domodax did not answer : the Mahatma is above discussion . But there is some truth in what Demodar said . For all the aloofness of the British ruling group , there is a class of well-bred Hindus who insist on " equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the antithesis of two hundred years of British administration . Two of these bright and unhappy young men once went to Firpo 's ? Calcutta 's smart night club ? only to be told by the manager that they would not be admitted in their dhotis ( the simple loin cloth ) ; Indians were welcome guests at Firpo 's , but they would have to come in European dress ? or , at least , in their long formal garments . My two friends , smelling a rat , went to the trouble of putting on their handsome coats and tight trousers which Hindus wear at formal occasions , and to their surprise they were admitted w : bout argument . In a way this inferiority complex has been accentuated by the recent " Indianization " of the Indian Government . Under the new constitution which gives Indians a large share of authority , some of those wen-bred Hindus found themselves suddenly promoted to high governmental positions ; and a few of these could not take it . One of them , who held a Cabinet job , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they came to see him on urgent business , cynically telling his friends that it was about time the British learned how to cool their heels in this hot climate . But the mirage is still floating in hot air , impervious to the touch of the native . Ask an Englishman in Calcutta whether he has ever been to a Hindu home , to eat dinner there with his hands , without knives and forks ; ask an Englishman in Fiji whether he has ever taken one of those South Sea Island beauties out for a dance ; ask an Englishman in Colombo whether he would ever go to spend a week-end with a Tamil family in their cool bungalow up in Kandy . You wo n't get a straight " No " for an answer ; rathera surprised jolt along the lines of a Hollywood " double take " ? how was that again ? Their aloofness , their disinclination to proselytize natives of other countries , is half the secret of the success of the colonial British . It explains the remarkable fact that a few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy thousand British soldiers , rule the three hundred and fifty million people of the Indian Empire . Frenchmen go to their colonies and make Frenchmen out of the natives . In their African territories the Negroes are taught to speak French , they are given positions in the French hierarchy , they become French citizens , and they may end up as Parisians . With the British it is different . British officers in black Africa learn native dialects ? Africans are not encouraged to learn English ? and the administration is carried on according to old native concepts , with the native hierarchy functioning alongside the British . The natives may rise ? but they 'll never rise to be black Englishmen . They will always be Africans , and proud of it . They will never drink water from the lake that rises , among palm trees , out of their desert land . For the lake and the palm trees and those white office buildings and hotels are a mirage. of the British Empire is that it is run as a club with headquarters in London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman 's house , to the news of the abdication of King Edward VIII . It was a made-to-order illustration of Empire symbolism . When the radio announcer had finished with his historic message there was a silence that seemed to last for hours . My host and his young wife were staring into space , paralyzed , unbelieving . Then suddenly they rose and fell into each other 's arms . She sobbed , and he found no more appropriate words of consolation than : " Darling , we still have each other ! " Ridiculous ? Sublime . The highest officer of the world 's most exclusive club had disregarded the rules ? and these two humble members had nothing left but themselves ! The men and women who enjoy the privileges of the Club are island people transplanted into a world throbbing with excitement . They soon find out that the old island attitude ? expressed in the legendary headline , " Fog Over English Channel ; Continent Isolated " ? wo n't do . They soon find that they arc in the center of a maelstrom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club members all over the globe , they realize the organic connection between happenings in Africa , Europe , Asia . The Mr. Smythe who directs a safari through a deserted part of Africa is likely to have a brother in the Governor 's office in Hongkong , a cousin by the name of Hawkins in Penang , two more cousins by the name of Smythe in India , and an uncle known to the world as Sir Archibald in Palestine . These relatives know one another intimately ; Hawkins and the older Smythe went to Cambridge with the Smythe who is on safari just now . They exchange letters once in a while , and if they do n't , Lady Cynthia , who is Uncle Archie 's wife and who lives all alone in the Kensington Square mansion , will tell them all about the other members of the Imperial Smythe family in her Christmas letters . Aunt Cynthia in Kensington Square is the living link between Cousin Hawkins in Penang and Cousin Smythe in East Africa . Aunt Cynthia links two parts of the Empire . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With most of us , " he said , " it is an obsession . It runs in families like a disease , and the first symptoms are likely to break out at an early stage . If your great-grandfather was with the East India Company , and your grandfather in China , and your father died in South Africa ? how could you expect a youngster to sit still and live and die in England ? " This organic connection , the membership in one great club where the Smythes and Hawkinses and Irvines and Aidridges have equal rights and duties , makes Imperial Britons peculiarly susceptible to the goings-on in the world . Back in 1938 , when the British people at home swallowed Mr. Chamberlain 's " peace in our time , " the Smythes and Hawkinses abroad uttered a plain " phooey . " They knew , better than Mr. Chamberlain and better than Lady Cynthia , who never left Kensington Square , what it was all about . They knew what Germany was doing in South Africa , Japan in East Asia , Italy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to enlist as volunteers . The Empire was ready for war long before England was . The Empire is run like a club , and it is hard to become a member . You pay your heavy fees while you arc in . Try to get out and you are branded as a shirker . Slander besmirched the flawless reputation of Sir Victor Sassoon , whose ancestors had made their fortune in the Imperial opium trade , when he transferred his millions from India to Hongkong . He said he did it because India 's nationalist movement hampered British business there . But a malicious rumor implied that India 's high taxes were the real reason for the transfer . Here was somebody who wanted to enjoy the advantages of the Club ? Hongkong was part of the Empire , too ? without paying his membership fee . The members did not approve . But most of them pay those fees without an argument . A government mining engineer living in an isolated jungle town in Burma was a rebel in his own right . " This does not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I believe I was in Poonaaah at that time . " Within the Club life is regulated by rigid standards . A British colonel who lives with his wife in a charming little bungalow in the outskirts of Singapore was kind enough to let me see his domestic budget . I reproduce it here , stripped of non-essentials : These standards have not changed much since Victorian times . The British Empire as we know it is Victorian . Its style of life was , until yesterday , a style which had gone out of fashion in Europe many decades ago . In the artificial atmosphere of the colonies it could perpetuate itself until it became ridiculous .

When the war broke out the Empire was a changing world ; to-day the changing process proceeds at an accelerated pace . Blocks of modern apartment houses have gone up in the cities of the Empire , and the Englishman is moving out of his dark and dingy bungalow and going to live in a flat where there is less danger of scorpions , spiders , snakes , and rats . He uses an electric refrigerator , has begun to refer to his tiffin as lunch , and entertains his friends at cocktails which have begun to shed th2ir quotation marks . He listens to the short-wave radio , and what he hears may come from the bombed cities of England or , perchance , from America . Meet the white man in his office on some forlorn island of the South Seas , and he will ask you , in all seriousness : " Do n't you think that Kaltenborn has been a bit anti-British these last few days ?

You expect to find an electric fan instead of punkahs slowly moved back and forth by a withered old woman crouching in the hall outside . You expect a telephone instead of a chit book . You expect a garage instead of stables . But Britain 's colonial empire is at war , and membership in the club which administers it has once more become the White Man 's burden . Not in Kipling 's sense to be sure . Colonial officials and merchants alike have become the pawns in a game that is played for larger stakes .

Enemy raiders may pour shells into the teeming ports of India and into the sheltered bays of South Sea islands . The wars of Europe may spill over into the rugged hills of Palestine . And although the colonial Englishman knows that it will be a pleasure to fight back , he knows also that he is left to fight against overwhelming odds . He is exposed ? even more exposed than people in London and Plymouth . Even in those parts of the Empire that are , at this writing , still only technically at war there is enough physical hardship to make the white man 's proverbial burden seem quite weighty .

The case before him was a routine matter : opium . But the accused was not routine : in the wooden stall , watched by bearded Sikh policemen , there stood the loveliest Chinese woman I have ever seen . I sat among the spectators with Walter Chong , a young Chinese business man .

Then the judge looked at her and said something that the law did not require him to say : " Opium poisons the Chinese people . It weakens their morale , and it makes them unable to resist their enemies . We have to stamp it out in this colony , and the law makes no allowance for age or sex . It is an unpleasant duty .

It seems to me that those critics overlook one fact : British justice . The native people of the Empire have come to appreciate it . They know that wherever there is a British judge on the bench they are getting a square deal . The Malay coolie and the blackest cannibal are subject to the white man 's law ; they are not subject to his arbitrary whims . And this square deal is the last and the most solid of the four pillars upon which Britain 's Empire rests . Britain 's guarantee of justice , acknowledged by Indian nationalists and African Bushmen alike , is incompatible with " Nazi methods . " Nazi justice is largely emotional ; British justice is stripped of all personal elements .

To-day , in Britain 's dark hour , the " oppressed and exploited " colonials reward decency with decency . India , instead of seizing this godsent opportunity and stabbing her British " oppressors " in the back , is actually co-operating with Britain in her fight against Nazi barbarism . Hindus who were ready to fight Britain yesterday will come out to-day and tell you that " Gandhi 's life under Hitler would n't be worth an anna .

Of all the signs of good fellowship and co-operation in the face of the common danger , the most moving news has come to me from the exposed port city of Aden , which was bombed repeatedly by Italian planes . The Arabs and the Hindus , the Parsis and the Sikhs formally agreed to forget their most jealously guarded differences of race , religion , and caste , and to allow their air-raid dead to be buried in common ground ? an unprecedented sacrifice . To-day , while London burns , the amazing Englishman sits in his Empire and does the most efficient ruling job ever done in the history of men . He does it without the roving spirit of his adventurer ancestors , without the cruelty of the conquistadores , without a missionary complex , without imagination , and without illusions . He sits there , braving a blistering heat , monsoons , typhoons , the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies , ghastly diseases , grotesquely high living costs , unpalatable food , and cr ? pe georgette that splits . He sits in his bar , his bungalow , his office ; he reads age-old newspapers and laughs about idiotic jokes . He does not mind the blackout and the anti-aircraft practice , and he still finds time to go for a slow drive under a diamond-studded sky . But in those sweltering nights he dreams of a little house in Surrey . How long will he be able to go on ? The question is difficult to answer . For the British Empire is a club , and it is one of the rules of the club that all affairs should be dealt with according to precedents . Is it perhaps this rule that makes it impossible for Imperial Englishmen to envisage defeat ? If you ask them about it they will tell you , with a blank and humorless face that looks more convincing than the muzzle of an eighteen-inch gun , that there is no precedent for it .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
