Editor Charles Clayton Morrison of the Christian Century believes that the surest way to keep Protestants constantly alert is to set off periodic charges of dynamite under them . His blasts frequently have the desired effect . <P> Sniffing through the U.S. Supreme Court 's recent decision that public funds may be used to pay children 's bus fares to &; from parochial schools ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) , Dr. Morrison found what looked like highly charged ammunition . In this week 's Century , he let it explode : <P> " The Supreme Court decision . . . should open the eyes of all American-minded citizens , and especially Protestant citizens , to the strategy of the Roman Catholic Church in its determination to secure a privileged position in the common life of this country . . . . The Roman Church wants the state to provide for the complete support of its parochial schools with money derived from taxes levied on all citizens . . . <P> " The Protestant churches have themselves to blame . . . . Few Protestant ministers have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that it was such ' a little thing ' to get excited about-first free textbooks , then free bus transportation , for parochial schools at public expense . They were blind to the strategy of the Roman Church in using these apparently insignificant matters as the thin edge of the wedge which would ultimately crack open the Constitution . . . . <P> " If Protestantism passively tolerates any compromise of the principle of the quality of all religious faiths before the American state , it seals its own destiny . It dooms itself to become , in the end , a minority sect existing on the margins of American life . . . . "
