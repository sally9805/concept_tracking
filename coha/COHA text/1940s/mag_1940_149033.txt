TIME does not ordinarily write about hypothetical cases ; it writes about events . But for the U. S. the biggest event of the last ten weeks has been the development of a hypothetical case which suddenly alters the whole outlook for U. S. national security . The article which follows is in no sense a prediction . It explores the immediate problem of U. S. Defense . What the U. S. people choose to do or not to do about the British Fleet is incomparably more important than any other decision they can make about National Defense in the summer of 1940 . <P> From Oran 's harbor , below the frowning heights of Algeria 's Jebel Murjajo , Britain got her full answer . It came with fearful finality . The question that Britain had faced was : What if France should lose ? From some of France 's **28;5188;TOOLONG poltroons , strong-minded pro-Nazis and plain defeatists-already had come the civilian 's answer : ignominious surrender . <P> Last fortnight , off the Mediterranean pirates ' 15th-Century stronghold at Mers-el-Kebir , France 's Navy added its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thousand French gobs , gay in their red pompons and striped shirts , who had frolicked with British seamen on shore leave below Oran 's quake-shattered Kasbah . It was put down in the hulk of the Dunkerque , France 's answer to Germany 's pocket battleships , now beached and battered by British bombs on the Barbary coast . It was repeated in the draggle-tailed flight of the crippled Strasbourg to Toulon , in the smashed hulks of four other men-of-war , in the sullen disarmament of the French squadron under British guns in Alexandria 's harbor . France 's last line had crumbled . <P> Last week as defeat-fluid France was poured inexorably into a Nazi mold , the U. S. , like Britain before it , faced a similarly pregnant question : What if Britain should lose ? <P> One important part of the answer to this question is obvious . If the British Isles should now be overwhelmed , the inescapable fact is that there will be a new mistress of the seas . None of Britain 's dominions has the financial or industrial resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not destroyed or made captive . <P> Another inescapable fact is that if Britain ceases to be mistress of the seas , the new mistress is almost certain to be either 1 ) Germany and her allies or 2 ) the U. S. and its allies ( if any ) . Recognition of this fact is implicit in the two-ocean navy program which the U. S. already has afoot . <P> For the greater part of its history the U. S. has lived under the umbrella of protection provided by the British Fleet . Until World War I the U. S. never attempted to claim naval parity and by that time was thoroughly satisfied with a century-old tacit understanding which made the two fleets not rivals but complements of each other .
