As warm , humid darkness fell on Wrightsville ( pop . 1,760 ) , Ga. , one night last week , a long line of automobiles drew up at the ballpark . It was the eve of rural Johnson County 's Democratic primary , and 400 Negroes had registered to vote . Two hundred and forty-nine men &; women climbed solemnly out of the cars , holding black oilcloth bags . Heads down* to evade the gaze of curious bystanders , they took out the white sheets and sugar-sack masks of the Ku Klux Klan and hurriedly pulled them on . Then , in slow single file , they marched to the paved square before the town 's dilapidated courthouse , where a crowd of 700 waited to applaud . <P> A white-robed figure scrambled selfconsciously to the courthouse lawn with a pesthole digger .

Governor Melvin Thompson took steps to counteract it . He ordered two prisoners removed from Reidsville 's safe Tatnall State Prison and sent back to a rural jail in Emanuel County where they are accused of having murdered a state patrolman .
