txt A movement of almost 7,000 persons across the Atlantic , most of it by air at a round-trip fare for Americans that amounts to about $350 , is now under way . It has been approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board for Transocean Airlines and Seaboard and Western Airlines because the scheduled lines have no capacity to meet such a mass movement . The project is confined here to transporting students , teachers and others interested in reconstruction to Europe under the auspices of Youth Argosy , Inc . From Europe , displaced persons are carried to this country under the sponsorship of the International Refugee Organization , an arm of the United Nations . The experiment is being watched closely , however , by almost everyone in the travel and foreign trade field . Representatives of the scheduled Atlantic carriers point out that the low rate is made possible because on each side of the ocean a nonairline organization takes care of all the costs that the airlines must add to the direct cost of flying their planes ? the maintenance of networks of traffic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . This , as a rule , accounts for as much as 60 cents lof each dollar of airline costs , as against 40 cents for direct flying costs . Hence , airline executives say , the winter excursion rate of the regular airlines just announced by the International Air Transport Association in Montreal ? $466.50 between Oct. 1 and March 31 next ? does not compare unfavorably with this summer 's special rate of $350 . The usual round-trip fare between New York and London , on which all others are based , is $630 . The new volume generated by the $350 fare , however , is what air economists are watching . That it , is new volume is amply attested1 by the answers to questionnaires received by Youth Argosy . An overwhelming number of its passengers said they would not have made the trip had the low air fare ' not been available . As far back as 1945 , Parker Van Zandt , then an economist for the , Brookings Institution , analyzed widespread questionnaires among , the readers of Collier 's and Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air fare to Europe 4,000,000 Americans a year would make the trip . That , said Mr. Van Zandt , would not only create an unprecedented volume of air traffic but build up a balance of travel dollars of better than $1,000,000,000 a year among countries that desperately needed such dollar balances . Even today , Juan T. Trippe , president of Pan American Airways , is said to have plans to carry 110 " cabin class " air passengers in each of his fleet of Boeing Stratocruisers now devoted to the luxury trade , at a roundtrip fare approaching the $200 level . Last week he testified before a Senate committee that whereas air traffic on the Atlantic was but 4 per cent in 1938 , with steamships carrying 96 per cent , the figures in 1948 stood at 521 per cent for air and 48 per cent , for steamships . There are various indications that the air proportion will be higher in 1949 despite the addition of many new steamship berths this year . Genesis of Cut Rate Both Seaboard and Western and Transocean last summer did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A reduced rate was possible because both air carriers were under contract to the IRO to carry plane loads of displaced persons to Venezuela via the United States . In the spring of this year the Venezuelan Government canceled its arrangements to receive the DP 's . As a consequence Youth Argosy found itself with about $250 , - 000 paid out on contracts to the two nonscheduled airlines , which would have become bankrupt if they had to fly their planes westward empty . The scheduled airlines already were so well booked that they could not have carried the increased load at any rate . Hurried trips to Europe by Youth Argosy and IRO officials showed that the latter organization had a big block of " austerity " berths reserved on such ships as the Samaria , Scythia and Aquitania for the late summer and autumn . A swap was made . Emergency cases in the DP camps were scheduled for immediate trips to the United States by air  --  pregnant women , women with small children families that had immediate opportunity for employment  --  and the berths thus made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by steamship . With this deal arranged , the CAB ten days ago authorized Transocean to make forty-four round-trip flights with these passengers , and Seaboard &; Western to make thirty-five . Usually the Argonauts take off from Bradley Field at Windsor Locks , Conn. near the headquarters of Youth . Argosy , a nonprofit organization at Northfield , Mass . At the week-end , however , several loads departed from New York International Airport at Idlewild , Queens , to which all the DP loads are brought . Contrast at Airport The contrast between the arrivals and those departing is a startling one . One Seaboard &; Western plane brought in nine Estonians , four Russians , two Latvians , seventeen Lithaunians , eleven Poles and four German Jews . All  --  men , women and children  --  had gone through the rigors of concentration and refugee camps . Only the children seemed bright-eyed . Six of the DP 's were farmers , mostly headed for the big Seabrook frozen food farms at Bridgeton , N. J. , with their families . There were seven children and eight housewives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented . One Pole was listed as " officer . " All were received here by such welfare organizations as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society , United Service for New Americans , National Catholic Welfare Council , United States Committee for the Care of European Children , National Lutheran Council , United Ukrainian American Relief Committee , Church World Service and American Committee for the Relief of Polish DP 's . Most of their passages had been arranged in the first place through these organizations . Outgoing the next day was a brisk load of typical American students , teachers and welfare workers . One Cornell medical student was to study the Scandinavian medical systems ; another was to examine health conditions in the DP camps . A Pennsylvania postgraduate was headed for study of Diesel engines in Europe . A large group was listed as about to study the United World Federalists , headed by Garry Davis , young musician who gave up his American citizenship in Paris .

These students , plus the wellpaid wage-earners with two or three weeks ' vacation , are most likely to make up the mass market for travel to Europe if its costs can be brought within their reach , it is declared .
