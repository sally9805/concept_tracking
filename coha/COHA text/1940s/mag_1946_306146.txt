Wyoming 's chief pride at the moment , aside from Yellowstone National Park , is the University of Wyoming basketball team . It claims to have the best-dressed coach , the craftiest dribblers , the deadliest sharpshooters in all the land-and most experts agree . <P> Three weeks ago , Coach Ev Shelton and his Wyoming Cowboys began a big-city invasion . Because most players have never been out of Wyoming , he lets them see the shows and the sights . Says he : " We let them have fun and thus keep them relaxed . " They relaxed at Gary , the first stop , and shot Valparaiso 's tall boys full of holes ; they mauled St. Joseph 's at Philadelphia . It was the same lopsided story against highly-touted Long Island U. at Madison Square Garden , against Washington U. at St. Louis . <P> Business &; Pleasure . Wyoming basketball tradition encourages every kid in the state to hope for college and team . Thus youngsters work hard . But most of the credit belongs to genial ex-footballer Shelton , who knows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shuns blackboard drills , sets no hard &; fast training rules . Unlike some coaches , Shelton does n't go overboard for elongated lads just because they are tall . Says he , " We try to get players who will fit our plan of offense rather than attempt to build plays around them . " He never works the team more than two hours a day . His practices start at 3 p.m. with shooting and play instruction for one hour . The last hour is devoted to scrimmage . His 19 offensive plays stress one talent , ball-handling . <P> Back home to Laramie last week , with ten straight victories on the books , went Wyoming to find that No. 11 was unlucky . Shelton &; Co. relaxed a little too much , lost to unneighborly Utah , 45-to-31.
