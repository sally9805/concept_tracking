Since Aug. 5 , Representative Thomas Francis Ford of California had kept his temper . This was a record for Mr. Ford . But last week he blew his top , with cause , over the treatment of the Price Control Bill . <P> A lank , dour fellow , with a face like a withered apricot , a sandy-grey pompadour , and a thundering disdain for anything Republican , Representative Ford is one of the shortest-tempered men in the House . He has been a 1,000% New Dealer ever since he came to Congress in 1933 , after ten years of editing the literary page of the anti-New Deal Los Angeles Times . <P> As a member of the House Banking &; Currency Committee , Mr. Ford had sat patiently through most of the hearings on the hashed , compromised , junk-assembled Price Control Bill . He had listened while the committee got a triple-plated Ph.D . course in high &; low economics from Price Boss Leon Henderson , in a steady examination that gave " The Great Jawbone " the probable all-time record for lengthy appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little respect either for Leon Henderson or for economic law . The Great Jawbone had hammered into their skulls a profound respect for himself-but the committee as a whole still had little respect for economics . Many of them privately agreed that a little inflation was probably a good thing ; most agreed that snow would fly before they got down to cases on ways and means to control skyrocketing prices , which are daily costing the defense program ( and the taxpayers ) millions of dollars , inevitably pulling down the standard of living , setting in motion a vicious spiral of inflationary forces . <P> All this the frumious Mr. Ford had watched . He had listened to paltering discussions of whether to impose wage controls and farm-price controls-two enormous areas which the bill in the first instance ignores , in the second winks at , lest labor and the farmers be outraged . ( This bogey had been challenged by Bernard M. Baruch , World War I defense tsar , who declared that the public will support any bill that is uniform in its treatment of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evenly administered . ) <P> Last week Mr. Ford listened to his colleague , red-faced Representative Thomas Rolph of San Francisco , lengthily examine Marriner S. Eccles , Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , on taxes . Mr. Ford knew that Mr. Rolph , not being a member of the House Ways &; Means Committee , has no particular say about taxes ; that Chairman Eccles , not being Secretary of the Treasury , has even less say . He knew that , while this theoretical discussion continued , prices were still going up ; that this bill was still in alarmingly unready shape . Suddenly roared Mr. Ford : <P> " Fiddling while Rome burns . . . here is the wave of inflation coming all over the country , and we sit here discussing something that is not even before the committee . Why ca n't we get down to cases and talk about price control ? " Mr. Ford stomped out , grinding his teeth . <P> After a startled moment , the committee went on hemming-hawing about excess-profits taxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
