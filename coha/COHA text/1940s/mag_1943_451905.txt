A THE age of sixteen I began to notice the charac- ters and quality of the other boys , and to find my ideal affinities . I say ideal affinities because I had always had instinctive or canine friends : boys or girls ? for there were several girls ? with whom I played or prattled , or danced at the dancing school . There , at about the age of ten , I had a sort of amonrette : absolutely groundless and silent , but absolutely determined . I remember the child perfectly . She had a dark complexion and curly black hair , and stood very straight , but gracefully . She was the first example to me of that admirable virtue cultivated by French actresses : eloquent stillness . I do n't think she ever said a word , and I very few ; but we always took each other out to dance , and were partners for the cotillion . Her MUM was Alice White , and I have never seen or heard of her since then . It was the friendship of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eschewed the rest of the litter . A less enigma tie companionship of my boyhood was with Charlie Davis . He was a soft blond youth , a little older and taller I han I , but mentally younger ; our great . pleasure was to laugh about everything , like silly girls . But in our daily walks from school we must have gabbled on many subjects , because after some years  --  he left school young to go into an office ? he became a Catholic , and asked me to be his sponsor at his christening . I was ; and I remember later his desire to enter a religious order . Let its hope , if I did n't save my own soul , that I saved the soul of Charlie Davis . My first real friend was Bentley Warren . We two with Dick Smith ( who afterwards took his mother 's name , Weston ) formed what we called the Trium- virate . Warren 's father , who had recently died , had been a Democratic Congressman , elected in an off year of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but two years of life in Washington , together with inherited dissentient opinions , had given his son a freer intelligence and a more varied experience than little Bostonians were likely to have . I often went to Mrs. Warren 's on holidays to tea ; and Warren sometimes came to lunch at our house , His Democratic views , if he had them , were not rabid ; his most intimate friends were Harry and Jim Garfield , sons of the future President of the United States ; and he left school at the end of our second class year in order to enter Williams College with the Garfields , a year before the rest of us were expected to be ready for the university . Dick Smith , too , on account of the tiff his father had with the headmaster , left school early during our last year ; so that as far as friendship was concerned ? so UM to me but so important ? the end of my school life might have been desolate . Not that my relations with Warren were broken off : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1885,1. went to Williamstown for the festivities at his graduation . I think it was my first journey undertaken merely for pleasure , and at my own expense . I went . to Williams again twenty or twenty-five years later , to reach a lecture on Shelley . Harry Garfield was president of the College ; we spoke of Bentley Warren and of the old clays , but with how different a sentiment ! For me those things had passed into the empyrean , into an eternal calm where their littleness or their greatness was nothing and their quality , their essence , everything ; for him they were merely early unimportant phases of the business which occupied him now , and not to be regarded on their own account . When I mentioned Bentley Warren , Garfield said : " Oh , yes . He is one of the Trustees of our College . " From this I gathered two things : that Warren had been " successful " and was now rich ; and that for Garfield this fact was what counted in Warren , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but just beyond school bounds a new friend appeared , Edward Bayley , I was lieutenant colonel of the Boston School Regiment , the colonel that year being from the English High School , which , back to back with the Latin School , was housed in tine other half of the sane new building . In some matter of vital importance to our forces it became necessary for me to consult my superior officer . We met by appointment , and found that the high questions of epaulettes or of buttons were soon disposed of ; but that first interview made us fast friends . We happened to live in the same quarter of the town , the Back Bay , about a mile from our schools , and we at once established the custom of waiting , he for me or I for him , at the corner , so as to walk home together . That winter my mother moved to Roxbury , having at last got rid of the dreadful burden of our Beacon Street house ; so that I saw my new friend only occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . The bond was established , silently of course , but safely . Even the fact that he was not going to college , but directly into some place of business , so that , as it actually came about , we never saw each other after that year , and hardly a letter passed between us , made no difference in our friendship , though it entirely separated our lives . Strange enchantment ! Even today , the thought of that youthful comradeship , without incidents , without background , and without a sequel , warms the cockles of my heart like a glass of old port . Is that all ? What did he do ? What did Inc say ? What did he stand for ? I confess that after sixty years I have to invent a theory to account for this fact . Why did a strictly Puritan and inward religion M lam , far from producing narrowness or fanaticism , produce charity and hospitality of mind ? Not that he was in I he least what was called liberal ? that is , indifferent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any discipline of his own . On the contrary he was absolutely loyal to his own tradition , and master of it : Ile was made , finished , imposing in the precision of his affections . I may be reading ideals of my own into that very young moo , in whom nothing of the sort may ever have come to light ; but potentially I can not help thinking that in him there was something his spiritual forebears never possessed : I mean humility and renunciation . A dumb inglorious Milton who was not a prig , an Emerson with warm blood , who was not proud or oracular or cosmographical , and never thought himself the center of the universe . Young Bayley was my first , perhaps my fundamental , model for The Last Puritan . It was doubtless the discovery that we were both ? but differently ? religious that made us so quickly sure of each other . Never was trust more instinctive , more complete , or more silent . It has lasted in silence , at least on my side , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend who turned up at Cortina about these very first friends of mine , Warren and Bayley . Did Inc know them ? Were they still living ? What had become of them ? And I was not surprised to hear the warmest eulogy of both , although my informant was a Lyman of the Lymans and a Lowell of the Lowells , while Warren and Bayley were not descendants of the Boston Brahmins . And I said to myself , " Oh , my prophetic soul ! " My earliest friendships were not illusions . IF fortune has been unkind to me in respect to my times , ? except that for tine intellectual epicure the 1890 's were enjoyable , ? in respect to the places fortune has been most friendly , setting me down not in any one center , where things supposed to be important or exciting were happening , but in various quiet places from which cross-vistas opened into tine world . Of these places the most familiar to me , after Avila , was tine Harvard Yard . I lived there for eleven years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proctor . No place , no rooms , no mode of living could have been more suitable for a poor student and a free student , such as I was and as I wished to be . My first room , on the ground floor in the northeast . corner of Hollis , was one of the cheapest to be had in Cambridge : the rent was $44 a year . I had put it first for that reason on my list of desired rooms , and I got my first choice . It was so cheap because it had no bedroom , no water , and no heating ; also the ground floor seems to have been thought less desirable , perhaps because the cellar below might increase the cold or the dampness . I do n't think I was ever cold there in a way to disturb inc or to affect my health . I kept the hard-coal fire banked and burning all night , except from Saturday to Monday , when I slept at my mother 's at Roxbury . An undergraduate 's room in any case is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , under pressure of some special task . At other times , there are constant interruptions , or temptations to interrupt one- self : recitations , lectures , meals , walks , meetings , and sports . I soon found the Library the best place to work in . It was not crowded ; a particular alcove where there were philosophical books at hand , and foreign periodicals , soon became my regular place for reading . As to my lodging , I had to snake up my sofa bed at night before getting into it ; in the morning I left the bedding to be aired , and the " goody , " whose services were included in the rent , put it away when she came to dust or to sweep . I also had to fetch my coal and water from the cellar , or the water in summer from the College pump that stood directly in front of my door . This was economy on my part , as I might have paid the janitor to do it for me ; perhaps also to black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had done it at home . But my life was a miracle of economy . I had an allowance from my mother of $750 a year to cover all expenses . Tuition absorbed $150 ; rent , $44 ; board at Memorial Hall , with a reduction for absence during the week-end , about $200 ; which left less than one dollar a day for clothes , books , fares , subscriptions , amusements , and pocket money . Yet on my less than one dollar a day I managed to dress decently , to belong to minor societies like the Institute , the Pudding , and the O.K. , where the fees were moderate , to buy all necessary books , and even , in my junior year , to stay at rich people 's houses , and to travel . Robert had given me his old evening clothes , which fitted me well enough : otherwise the rich people 's houses could not have been visited . Doing my " chores " was something I rather liked , as I still brush and pack my own clothes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than drive , circumstances permitting . A little manual work or physical exercise changes the stops agreeably , lengthens the focus and range of vision , reverts to the realm of matter which is the true matrix of mind , and generally brings judgment and feeling back into harmony with nature . I have never had a manservant , and later when I lived in hotels I seldom called on the servants for any personal service not in their common routine . This trait is a heritage from the humble condition of my father 's family and my mother 's reduced circumstances during my boyhood . I had not an aristocratic breeding ; not only was I not served , but I was taught no aristocratic accomplishments ? not even riding or driving or shooting . What is a gentleman ? A gentleman is a man with a valet ; originally he also had a sword , but in my time that was obsolete except for officers in full uniform ; a bank account could take its place . But having many servants , though it makes a man a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one be . cause his wife may keep servant girls in the house ; he is one only if he has a body servant of his own , This defines the Spanish gentleman as well as the ' English gentleman . To be a complete gentleman he should also have a horse , and should ride it gallantly . Don Quixote , too , had a horse , as well as a servant . Life in the Yard for me , during my second period of residence there , 1890-1896 , had a different qual. ity . I had n't a horse or a valet , but could count on enough pocket money , a varied circle of friends , clubs , and ladies ' society in Boston and Cambridge , and the foreglow and afterglow of holidays spent in Europe . The first year , when I had only one foot in the stirrup and was not yet in the saddle as a Harvard teacher , I lived in Thayer ; graceless quarters and the insecure stammering beginnings of a lecturer , The next year I again had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoughton , in the southeast corner of the first floor , where I stayed for six win . ters . Here there was a bedroom , and my coal and water were brought up for me by the janitor ; on the other hand I often made my own breakfast ? tea , boiled eggs , and biscuits ? and always my tea in the afternoon , for I laud now lived in England and learned the comforts of a bachelor in lodgings . Only ? what would not have happened in England ? I washed my own dishes and ordered my tea , eggs , milk , and sugar from tine grocers : domestic cares that pleased me and that preserved my nice china , a present from Howard Cushing , during all those years . There was a round bathtub under my cot , and my sister 's crucifix on the wall above it : only cold water , but the contents of the kettle boiling on the hearth served to take off the chill . I had also acquired a taste for fresh air , and my window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goody left the bathtub full of slops , explaining that she had n't known what to do with it ; it was the only bathtub in her entry . I had myself taken only recently to a daily sponge bath . When I was an undergraduate few ever took a bath in Cambridge ; those who lodged in private houses might share one bathroom between them , and those who went to the Gymnasium might have a shower bath after exercise ; but your pure " grind " never bathed , and I only when I went home for the week . end . My father used to say that the English had intro ? duced baths into Christendom from India ; but I sus ? pert that it was luxury and the femmes galantes of the eighteenth century that did it . What could he more un-English than a languid female in a turban , not unattended , and not without a semi-transparent clinging garment , like that of a statue , getting in or out of a marble bath like an ancient sarcophagus , itself draped and lined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature coquetry . And the Christian background appears in the gown worn in the bath , according to the monastic precept of never being wholly naked . No such scruple exists in England or among athletes . The tone there is masculine and hardy , with a preference for cold water and the open air . Robert Bridges , the most complete of Englishmen , at the age of eighty , used to take his cold bath every morning in the lounge-hall of his house , before a roaring wood fire . Here was Sparta rather than India transported to the chilly North , In Spain , in those days , there were no baths in houses . My sister procured an immense zinc tub , in the middle of which , when it was full , a special stove had to be introduced to heat the water , which a special donkey laden with four earthen jars had to carry from the fountain ; the thing did n't work , and I doubt that she took more than one or two baths . For one she got a manageable little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoughton were twin red-brick build ! ings of the eighteenth century , solid , simple , symmetrical , and not unpleasing . No effort had been made by the builders towards picturesqueness or novelty ; they knew what decent lodgings for scholg ars were , and that there was true economy in building them well . The rectangular wooden window frames divided into many squares , flush with the walls , and painted white , served for a modest and even gay decoration . On the whole , it was the architecture of sturdy poverty , looking through thrift in the direction of wealth , It well matched the learning of early New England , traditionally staunch and narrow , yet also thrifty and tending to positivism ; a learning destined , as it widened , to be undermined and to become , like the architecture , flimsy and rich . It had been founded on accurate Latin and a spellbound constant reading of the Bible ; but in the Harvard of my day we had heard a little of everything , and nobody really knew his Latin or knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew ? his Bible , and the professors of Latin their Latin . No doubt , in the sense that they could write technical articles on the little points of controversy at the moment among philologists ; but neither Latin nor the Bible flowed through them and made their spiritual lives ; they were not vehicles for anything great . They were grains in a quicksand , agents and patients in an anonymous moral migration that had not yet written its classics . Holworthy Hall in my day had no baths , not even shower baths , and no central heating . Modern improvements seem to me in almost everything to be a blessing . Electricity , vacuum cleaning , and ladies ' kitchens render life simpler and more decent ; but central heating , in banishing fireplaces , except as an occasional luxury or affectation , has helped to destroy the charm of home . I do n't mean merely the ancient and rustic sanctity of the hearth ; I mean also the home comforts of the modern bachelor . An obligatory fire was a useful and blessed thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Round it you sat , into it you looked , by it you read , in it you made a holocaust of impertinent letters and rejected poems . On the hob your kettle simmered , and the little leaping flames cheered your heart and ventilated your den . Your fire absolved you from half your dependence on restaurants , cafes , and servants ; it also had the moralizing function of giving you a duty in life from which any distraction brought instant punishment , and taught you the feminine virtues of nurse , cook , and Vestal virgin . Sometimes , I confess , these cares became annoying ; the fire kept you company , but like all company it sometimes interrupted better things . At its best , a wood fire is the most glorious ; but unless the logs are of baronial dimensions , it dies down too quickly , the reader or the writer is never at peace ; while a hard-coal fire ( which also sometimes goes out ) sleeps like a prisoner behind its iron bars , without the liveliness of varied flames . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in England and also in America when I chose ; like true beauty in woman , it combines brilliancy with lastingness . I congratulate myself that in the Harvard Yard I was never heated invisibly and willy-nilly by public prescription , but always by my own cheerful fire that made solitude genial and brought many a genial friend who loved cheerfulness to sit by it with rne , not rejecting in addition a drink and a little poetry ; no tedious epic , but perhaps one of Shakespeare 's sonnets or an ode of Keats , something fit to inspire conversation and not to replace it . 11 MY ELE2TION to the Lampoon Board ? because of some drawings I submitted ? was a decisive event in my Harvard life . Two other freshmen , Felton and Sanborn , had also been elected ; and they asked me to come and sit at their table in Memorial Hall . Felton 's chum , Baldwin , was also there , and some other friends ; so I immediately found myself in a little circle of more or less lively wits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In time , the inner circle narrowed down to four : the three I have mentioned and me . We kept up our comradeship at table for four years ; and Sanborn and I became personal friends on intellectual grounds . In those clays freshmen at Harvard were still at school . Courses were prescribed , and we sat in alphabetical order , to be marked present or absent . Sanborn and I were therefore likely to sit next to each other : not always , because those who had passed in French had to take German , and vice versa , and in some subjects the two hundred and fifty freshmen were divided into more or less advanced classes . But I remember especially in Natural History 4 , where Professor Shaler set forth " all the geology necessary to a gentleman , " sitting next to Sanborn . We had separate chairs but one running desk in front of us , so that we could easily look at each other 's notebooks ; and we amused ourselves in matching triolets , not always on that " concatenation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where Felton and Baldwin lived , No. 1 Thayer , was the reality under the literary fiction of a Lampoon " Sanctum . " We gathered there to compose our parts of the fortnightly edition ; chiefly drawings , although sometimes the column of puns entitled " By the Way " was concocted by us cooperatively , in the midst of a thousand interruptions . I never wrote for the Lampoon ; even the text for my sketches was usually supplied for me by the others , who knew the idioms required . My English was too literary , too ladylike , too correct for such a purpose ; and I never acquired , or liked , the American art of perpetual joking . What we printed was a severe selection from what we uttered : it had to be local , new or fresh , and at least apparently decent . Speech in this circle , if not always decent , never became lewd . There was an atmosphere of respect for holy things , of respect for distant or future ladyloves , and also of self-respect . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yard , the College had brought us together ; and when we scattered , the comradeship ceased . I scarcely knew what became of . Felton or Baldwin . The man who gave the tone to the Lampoon at that time was Eugene Thayer , not one of our group . He seemed a man apart , and his wit was not so much jocular as Mercutio-like , curious and whimsi cal , as if he saw the broken edges of things that appear whole . There was some obscurity in his play with words , and a feeling ( which I shared ) that the absurd side of things is pathetic . Probably nothing , in his later performance may bear out what I have just said of him , because American life was then becoming unfavorable to idiosyncrasies , and the current smoothed and rounded out all the odd pebbles . In our last year or two , the Lampoon possessed a business manager whose name is known everywhere , and who is identified , perhaps more than anyone else , with that inexorable standardizing current namely , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that his father was a millionaire and a Senator from California gave him an independence that displeased the undergraduate mind , and his long cigars were bad form in the Yard . Yet his budding powers as a newspaper owner and manager made him invaluable to the Lampoon in its financial difficulties . He not only knew how to secure advertisements , but he presented us with a material Sanctum , carpeted , warmed by a stove , and supplied with wooden armchairs and long tables at which all the illustrated comic papers in the world were displayed as exchanges for our little local and puerile Lumpy . How easily a little cool impudence can deceive mankind ! T. the Harvard Yard in spirit , though not topographically , may be assigned my other contacts with college life during those first four years . Athletics did not figure among them . I never took any exercise except walking , and I seldom went , as yet , even to watch the games , which in the case of football was then clone as in England , standing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a chalk mark or a rope . This " Harvard indifference " was not due to intense study on my part or to misanthropy . I played the leading lady in the Institute theatricals of 1881 ; and two years later , though I no longer looked at all deceptive in feminine clothes , I was one of the ballet in the Hasty Pudding play . These amusements , with rehearsals and a noisy trip to New York as a theatrical company , involved a good deal of intimacy for the moment . More intellectual , at least nominally , were the literary groups or societies of which , for me , the O.K. and the Harvard Monthly , when that was founded , were the most important . The members of the two were largely the same , and included Lampoon men as well ; but the O.K. , which later gave excellent dinners , had the advantage of running over into the class of merely intelligent or even athletic leaders of the College . In a commercial civilization , these were likely to be much better beings than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future lawyers , though these might have more historical and rhetorical attainments . The Harvard Monthly was founded by A. B. Houghton , afterwards American Ambassador at Berlin and London . His literary quality was in marked contrast with Sanborn 's , as were also his character and fate . Houghton was as rich as Sanborn was poor ; he was ambitious and bitter , nominally preoccupied with socialism and pessimism not , I think , in a clear speculative spirit , but rather as scandals and dangers that the leaders of liberalism and plutocracy must somehow overcome . His conscience and critical faculty were not at peace about the way in which his father made money : it was chiefly in a glass factory , and the son would ask himself how many glass blowers died each year from blowing into those furnaces . I knew Houghton very well ; we discussed all manner of subjects . In 1898 he unexpectedly made me a visit in Wattle Street . He glanced about my quarters disapprovingly , sucked his enormous cigar , and said magisterially that it was a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never been aware of swimming against any stream : I have merely stood on the bank or paddled about in the quiet backwaters . From there I may have observed that the torrent was carrying down more or less wreckage . My philosophy throws no challenge to those who rush clown the very middle of the rapids and rejoice in their speed . I will say nothing more about the Harvard Yard . It has lost its character and its importance . When President Lowell was planning his " I-louses " to be built by the river , he very kindly urged me to remain and take part in the experiment . I could have lived very like a don at Oxford or Cambridge . But it was too late . My heart might have been in the thing twenty years earlier , and perhaps then the transformation of Harvard into a University of Colleges might have been socially more successful . But by 1919 the non-collegiate additions had become too important for such a reorganization . The community too had outgrown the instinct for a secluded life . Colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious traditions , social and sporting , might develop together with an exact but familiar and humanistic learning . Now looser , wider , more llliScellaucous interests had invaded every mind . But I am not writing a history of Harvard University . I know very little about it . I knew only tine Harvard Yard . 12 rue chief event of my freshman year occurred towards the end of it . I received ? what was unprecedented ? a note from home , asking me to be in my room on the following evening , because my mother and sisters were conning to lay before me an important proposal . I guessed at once what it would be , although no hint had been dropped on the subject . I was to go to Spain that summer to see my father . My mother evidently felt profoundly the recent relief to her finances , and wished to be generous . Sending me to college , even on my modest allowance , had already consumed perhaps a fourth of her income ; yet she still had money to spare , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father during these ten years ; in her view she had done nothing for me ; for giving me food and lodging and a hundred dollars a year for clothes , books , and pocket money was something she owed to herself . She would not have allowed a child of hers to beg or go in rags ; and even in sending me to college sine was carrying out a plan of her own , and trying to make me into what she wished inc to be , rather than into what my father or I secretly desired . But now , in letting me go to see him , she was doing us an unselfish kindness , relenting as it were mind letting us , for a moment , have our own way . Neither my father nor I had made any such suggestion ; but it was impossible that he should n't wish to see his son grown up ; and everybody knew at home how I longed to travel , to see again with my own eyes old towns , cathedrals , castles , and palaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , at least in the parts I knew , nature as well as society seemed to lack contrast mind definition , as if everything were half formed and groping after its essence . Late in June I started accordingly on my first journey alone , and sailed from New York for Antwerp . Robert had looked up the various routes possible , and it had been decided that I should go and return by the Belgian or Red Star Line . The ship was decent as standards stood in those ( lays , but second-rate , perhaps of 5000 tons ; and as usual I was dreadfully seasick ; so much so that the doctor and the stewardess took pity on me , some ladies became interested ( I was nineteen years old ) , and a bed was rigged up for me on deck , where , as they said , I should enjoy tine sunshine and the air . The fresh air was indeed a relief but the glare an added nuisance ; and the coining and going of people , and their talk , only intensified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was too ill for the moment to be ashamed of myself ; but when I once got back to my cabin , although I was n't alone even there , the feeling of shame came over me . They say dying animals go into hiding ; and I could understand that instinct . There are phases of distress when help is neither possible nor desired . It is simpler , easier , more honest to be seasick alone , and to die alone . When I appeared on deck again , looking and feeling perfectly well , shaved and in fresh linen , I was congratulated . One particular lady of uncertain age , who now explained that she was Mrs. X of Cincinnati , Ohio , had to be thanked for the kindness she had shown , or at least intended , on the day of that disgusting exhibition which I was heartily sorry to have made of myself . A young man should be hardier , and I had been sicker than any girl . Mrs. X had brought me a raw egg in brandy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dire results : brandy on such occasions is a brutal remedy that my throat , not to say my stomach , abhors . At Antwerp I had just time to see the market place , with the Cathedral spire like a group of inverted icicles rising above it ; and inside , besides the general splendor of a great living place of worship , I admired the two magnificent , if theatrical , pictures by ltubens at the head of the two aisles , especially the " Descent from the Cross . " Yet this is too classic , too Michelangelesque for Flanders ; I could have wished to carry away some humbler and more intimate memories , but the gorgeousness of Rubens blotted out the rest . In Paris I saw nothing , merely driving from one station to the other ; but at the Gare d'Orleans I found myself in the sort of difficulty that inexperience will fall into . I was provided with just the amount of French money that I had calculated would be sufficient , leaving a decent margin for emergencies ; and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-class ticket to Avila . I could have a ticket to Avila , the man said , but only first class for the express : the ordinary trains , with second and third class , would take more than two whole clays for the journey . I counted my money . I could take a first-class ticket and have 15 francs left . Would that be enough for meals and tips on the journey ? I would risk it . It was only thirty-six hours , two nights and one clay ; at a pinch , I could have a sandwich instead of a dinner . It would n't kill me . My 15 francs , however , were only just enough to pay my way on that first occasion ; and I found at Trim that I had only a few coppers in my pocket and could n't telegraph to my father , as had been agreed , that I was arriving at 5.30 the next morning . It was broad daylight , being early in July , and I recognized the walls and the Cathedral tower , touched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was nobody to receive me , and no vehicle . Not even anybody to carry my valise . I left it with the guard , and started alone on foot , immensely happy , and remembering perfectly that station road and the place among the first houses to the left , opposite the church and convent of Santa Ana , where Don Juan the Englishman 's house stood , which was now no father 's . There it was , the middle one of three humble two-story buildings , not properly lined up , and painted in varying weather-worn yellows or grays , with red tiled roofs . I pounded the middle door with the knocker . No answer . Finally a neighbor , from a window over the bakery in the house to the left , put out her disheveled head and said , " Knock hard . They are all deaf in that house . " I knocked harder , until the window over my door was opened also , and another head , evidently the housemaid 's , peered out , and looked at me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does n't he ? I am his son . " She smiled , wished me a good arrival , and said they were expecting me but not that morning . El Senor was still in bed ; la Senora ( his sister Maria Ignacia ) was in the garden . And presently the door was opened for me . At the end of the stone-paved passage running through the house , I could see the so-called garden , and my aged aunt standing there , stooping a little , with a watering pot in her hand . The maid tactfully ran ahead and announced me loudly , and after emr bracing my aunt , whom I had never seen before , I had some difficulty in making her hear and under ? stand why I had n't telegraphed . Then I was led up to my father 's room , where the same embraces and the same explanations , under the same difficulties , were duly repeated . But it was all right now ; and rather characteristic of a young son from half round the world to arrive home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
