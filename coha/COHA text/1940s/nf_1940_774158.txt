txt  | Obviously their effect upon a substantial minority must have been profound and upon the majority their influence must have been considerable . The very discipline which we have noted must have brought many nearer to the standards of Jesus than would have been possible without the Church . What impress did Jesus make upon the structure of GrwcoRoman culture , upon the institutions and customs which shaped the lives of non-Christians as well as Christians ? A number of factors would lead one to expect the effect not to be very marked . The early Christians had no ambition to reorganize society as a whole . They looked for the ' speedy termination of the existing order by the direct act of God and the early return of their Lord . So far as possible , the first communities of Christians held themselves aloof from the world about them and made no serious attempt to transform it . When , in the fourth and fifth centuries , the large majority of the population of the Roman Empire assumed the Christian name , the Church came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . Under these circumstances it was very difficult for the Church to be critical of the state . Moreover , although the conversion of the Roman Empire brought most of the GraecoRoman world into the Church , the rapidity of the mass movement resulted in such a dilution of the Church with millions who had little or no conception of the teachings of Jesus that the initial effect upon society as a whole was presumably not very great . Indeed , the dilution might well be permanent . Only an exceptional inherent vitality would enable Christianity to assimilate these multitudes and transform them to such an extent that they would alter the institutions of society . Then , too , before the assimilation could  | be carried tar the barbarian invasions of the fifth century slowed it down or interrupted it . In spite of these obstacles Christianity , and through it the impulse which came from Jesus , had very considerable results in modifying the institutions and customs of the Roman Empire . The stamp which Christianity made on GraecoRoman society was not nearly so deep as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later centuries , but it was distinctly noticeable . The most prominent of the effects on Grxco-Roman culture , the elimination of all the religious rivals of Christianity except Judaism , we have already mentioned . This was revolutionary . For magnitude , as we have said , it had not previously been equalled in the history of the race . Other changes were not nearly so spectacular or so thoroughgoing . Another result was the modification of the prevailing amusements . Leading Christians had long condemned the most prominent of the customary diversions of GraecoRoman society . Among pagans the gladiatorial contests enjoyed wide popularity and were condoned or even approved by some of the most virtuous . Even the high-minded and conscientious Marcus Aurelius financed and attended them . Yet at least some prominent Christians denounced them . Thus Tertullian objected to them partly on the ground that they were begun in honour of the gods , and partly because they engendered in in the spectators rage , bitterness , and grief . Cyprian declared that by them " man is slaughtered that man may be gratified " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tatian dubbed the gladiatorial show " a cannibal banquet for the soul , " and Minucius Felix declared that it inculcated murder . To be sure , after the conversion of the Empire multitudes  | of nominal Christians continued the attendance of their forefathers at the spectacles . When the games came to an end it was probably as much because of the increasing poverty of the Empire and the diminishing supply of war captives as it was because of a quickened conscience . Yet that the Christian conscience had a part in the outcome is incontestable . The Emperor Constantine maintained the official patronage of the amphitheatre for at least a decade after his conversion , but he is said later to have forbidden gladiatorial shows and to have abolished the penalties which recruited the ranks of gladiators from among the criminals . The stern disapproval of many Christian teachers was probably not without effect , and it is not surprising that report has it that gladiatorial combats came to an end in the city of Rome when the monk Telemachus leaped into the arena in protest against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption of their pastime . Early , too , outstanding Christians objected to the theatre . Their criticism was that it portrayed immorality and taught incest and adultery . The great preacher and bishop , John Chrysostom , fulminated against the farces and pantomimes which were popular with members of his flock . Here the criticism had less result and carried weight only with a minority . The theatre long persisted in the nominally Christian empire . Yet in the fourth century the Christian conscience was so far effective that it put into the statutes the provision that if an actress in articulo mortis asked for and received the last sacraments , she was not , if she recovered , to be forced back into her old life . The Christian conscience , too , contributed to the mitigation of the institution of slavery . Slavery was very wide-spread in the Graco-Roman world .  | In the ancient Greek " democracies " manual labor was performed chiefly by slaves and was esteemed beneath the dignity of free citizens . In Roman imperial days the work on the farms was largely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much of this bondage was heartless . One distinguished Roman thriftily sold his slaves at a low price or drove them away when they became too old to be profitable , and some masters exposed or killed their slaves when they were no longer of use . As time passed , various factors quite aside from Christianity contributed to the betterment of the slaves ' condition . The ethics of Stoicism were ameliorative . The cessation of conquests in the declining days of the Empire led to a reduction in the supply . Gradually the slave tended to rise to a half-free position , while many of the former free citizens sank to a semi-servile condition . Moreover , Christians never conducted a campaign against slavery . That was to wait until the sixteenth century and after . Probably much of such improvement as occurred in the lot of the slave would have taken place entirely aside from Christianity . Yet the influence of Christianity was decidedly on the side of the slave . Paul declared that " in Christ Jesus " there was neither bond nor free . He sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian and did not ask for his emancipation , but he urged the master , who was also a Christian , to receive him as a brother . Christianity stressed the duty of work and thus may have lightened somewhat the opprobrium under which labour had suffered . Ambrose declared that a slave might be of much better character than his master , and Augustine said that God did not intend that rational man should be lorded over by his rational fellows . Christians came to regard manumission as a pious deed , and  | the act was frequently solemnized by being performed in a church and on the great festivals of the Christian year . Presumably it was Christian influence which led Constantine to enact legislation which facilitated manumission and mitigated the lot of the slave . Christianity effected changes in sex mores , in the family , and in the status of women and children . In the Gra co-Roman world there was much of sexual laxity and perversion . Prostitutes , both men and women , were numerous , and in some places their profession was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is probably easy to exaggerate this type of corruption of the world in which Christianity had its inception . The very fierceness of pagan satire against it is proof that by no means all non-Christians condoned it . Yet that it was present and was admitted quite without apology into prominent and cultivated circles is abundantly clear . To all sexual irregularities the Christian conscience was utterly opposed . Jesus received tenderly the repentant woman of the street , but not with any tolerance of her past offences . Her gratitude he held to be evidence that her sins , which , he declared , were many , had been forgiven . He insisted that sexual sin was not only a matter of overt act but also of desire , and demanded purity of thought as well as abstention from impurity of deed . In the " works of the flesh " which Paul listed as opposed to the " fruits of the Spirit " sexual offences loomed prominently . Again and again Christian writers insisted upon self-control in sex as a Christian virtue . The Church officially considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with them in its membership accordingly . It found them too deeply embedded in human nature and in contemporary custom to be eliminated  | entirely , even from its own membership in the days when it was still a minority cult , but it struggled vigorously against them . No doubt can exist that through the impulse which came originally from Jesus thousands were delivered from slavery to their passions and that other thousands , nurtured in the Church , were preserved from contamination . As to the family , Christianity made for monogamy . It esteemed marriage , too , as deserving the blessing of the Church . It inculcated continence before marriage and fidelity to the marriage bond . After his conversion Constantine framed laws which rendered divorce more difficult than it had been in pagan times . Under later Christian emperors concubinage was forbidden and adultery was declared a capital offence . In general , Jesus brought dignity to womanhood . Women had been among his devoted followers and he had healed them , physically , mentally , and morally , as he healed men , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his example , Paul declared that " in Christ Jesus " there was neither male nor female , and the leading Christian writers and teachers of the first centuries recognized no distinction between men and women as potential heirs of eternal life . To be sure , woman was often looked upon as the " weaker vessel " and by many monks she was spurned as a temptation , but women also entered the monastic life . ' Then , too , Paul , prizing celibacy though he did , charged husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the Church . Thereby he elevated both the conjugal relationship and the status of women . For childhood , too , the influence of Jesus tended to greater respect . His insistence that children be allowed to come to him , " for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven , " might not  | always be remembered . However , the Church officially condemned abortion as murder and opposed the exposure of children and the infanticide which seem to have been common in the Graco-Roman world . Christians often rescued abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to the diminution of the ancient absolute authority of the father over the child ? a process which was already under way . The influence of Jesus furthered care for the underprivileged . Public benefactions were not the creation solely of Christianity . They were a prominent feature of pagan life . Men of wealth and government officials from the emperors down were expected to make donations for the enjoyment and welfare of the masses . Libraries , schools , baths , temples , theatres , and markets were erected , roads , bridges , and aqueducts were built , games were provided for the public , and grain was distributed to the poor ? from the private purses of the opulent . Four innovations , however , were brought by Christianity . First , all Christians , and not merely the wealthy , were to contribute , each according to his ability . Second , the motive of giving was gratitude for the love of God and the hope of reward in a future life . Third , the gifts were chiefly for unfortunate members of the Christian community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unemployed , and those imprisoned for their faith . Fourth , as a corollary to this last , Christian charity was probably more discriminating than was that of pagans . It inquired more closely into the needs of the individual who was helped . Towards war the attitude of Christians varied . In the early centuries some Christians felt that they could not consistently engage in any taking of human life , whether as soldiers or as executioners . Yet even in the earliest days soldiers were bap-  | tized without the requirement , so far as we know , that they change their profession . Never was there any effort in the name of Jesus to abolish war entirely . Later , when the emperors became Christians and the state accorded the Church its support , any opposition to military service , at least so far as the utterances of ecclesiastical dignitaries went , disappeared . How far the influence of Jesus made a difference in the realm of economics is difficult to determine . As we have seen , slavery was mitigated and monks renounced private possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant should attempt to discover what was a just price for his wares and to ask no more and accept no less . This would have eliminated much of the haggling so familiar in Oriental buying and selling . Some of the leading Christian writers , while not condemning wealth or private property , held that Christians should not think of themselves as being entitled to do as they liked with the property in their possession , but that they should think of themselves as merely having the use of it and as holding it in trust . However , no extensive effort was made by Christians completely to reorganize the economic life of the Empire . Except perhaps for slavery , in the main they seem to have had little effect upon it . Upon language the impulse which came from Jesus made a marked impression . In later centuries , especially after i 800 , this was very extensive . In these initial five centuries it had begun . In some areas Christianity made for the elimination of local idioms and the spread of a common tongue . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greek it ) place of the various local languages , in Gaul it assisted in  | the substitution of Latin ( the language of the Church ) for the older Celtic speech , and in North Africa it appears to have encouraged the extension of Latin . In several other regions , however , Christianity , in the effort to reach the common man with the Gospel , to educate him in things Christian , and to help him to worship intelligently , encouraged the preservation of the native tongues . Some it raised to the dignity of literary languages . Thus Armenian was given a new alphabet and in the fifth century under the Christian impulse Armenian literature entered upon a golden age . The Georgians were given two alphabets and their language was enriched with new words . The oldest extant example of a Germanic tongue is in portions of the translation of the Bible into Gothic attributed to Ulfilas , the famous missionary to the Goths , and in a script said to have been devised by him . Syriac literature was developed Mari passu with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearly the product of Christianity . Christianity seems to have entered Egypt through the medium of the Greek tongue , and to have spread first among the Greekusing urban population . IIowever , as it penetrated to the masses whose language was native Egyptian , in place of the ancient Hieroglyphics which would have been as unintelligible as the Greek , a script was developed for the indigenous tongue , translations were made , and a literature was developed . Upon the state the effect of Christianity was not in this period as marked as it was to be later . Here and there laws were modified , but the chief innovations were the loss by the emperors of the divinity which had been ascribed to them ,  | and the paralleling of the state by an institution , the Church , which divided with it the allegiance of men . Roman emperors had traditionally been esteemed divine . As Christians they sacrificed this status and in matters religious became ? in theory and often in practice ? members of the Church and subject to it . Relations between Church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully shall the Chinni claitn the allegiance of the Christian ? What is C.esar 's and what is God 's ? Obviously a Christian 's primary loyalty is to God and when Caesar and God conflict the Christian must choose God . I lowever , who is to determine when a conflict occurs ? Shall the individual or shall the Church ? Shall the Church claim to be the one Christian society and insist upon supervising all human activities and institutions , including the state ? Or has the state a divine function and in that realm is it independent of the Church ? These are issues brought to the race by the appearance of Jesus and the rise , through him , of the Church . In no other religion have they been so acute . Before Constantine the state attempted , notably in the great persecutions , to solve the problem by destroying the Church . Beginning with Constantine , the state sought peace with the Church . Peace was attained in part by an alliance between the two institutions which left special functions to each , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his successors made Christianity an official and eventually the only official cult of the state . Traditionally in the Roman Empire the state had completely controlled the official cults . By becoming a state religion Christianity tended to accept the status of its predecessors . Its institutional expression , the Church , became more subject to the state than before . That relation was largely preserved in the Byzantine continuation  | of the Roman state and in eastern realms whose polity was derived from the Byzantine Empire . With states officially nonChristian , the relation of the Church was often one of opposition . Sometimes it was one of partial supervision by the state through a voice in appointing the head ecclesiastics . Only in the West , where the weakening or collapse of the Roman regime left the Church dominant , was the Church able , and then only at intervals , to make good its claim to superiority over the secular authorities . Inevitably the question arises as to how far , if at all , Jesus was responsible for what is usually called the " fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the decline of the Empire into which he had been born ? Was he an important factor in the decay of that Grrco-Roman culture in which were summed up the contributions of so many of the previous efforts of mankind to construct civilization ? The question is not new . Repeatedly in the third , fourth , and fifth centuries , when the Graco-Roman world was obviously suffering from grievous maladies , Christians were accusal by pagans of being responsible . Even of late years there have not been lacking those who have taken up the plaint  --  though with somewhat different arguments . In some respects Christianity , and so Jesus , was a contributing factor to the debacle . As we have seen , Christianity destroyed or weakened certain features of Grxco-Roman culture . It eliminated the ancient official cults . It brought to an end the pagan schools of philosophy . It denied the divinity of the emperor . It challenged the authority of the state to the complete control of the conscience of the Christian and in a series of contests survived through a settlement which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church . It assisted in the modification of the type of labour , slavery , which was  | an integral part of the economic structure of Graeco-Roman society . Yet it must be said that Christianity , if a factor at all , had merely a minor part in bringing about the decay of the ancient world . The malady had its insidious onset long before the influence of Jesus had become at all wide-spread . The disease probably had its inception even before the birth of Christ and its course was only retarded by the formation of the Roman Empire ? on the eve of the birth of Jesus . Moreover , it must also be pointed out that in some regions Christianity slowed down the decline . In the Greek East , where the old order , modified , held on longest , Christianity proved a unifying factor . The sense of being a bulwark of the faith and , so it was held , having divine support , nerved the Byzantine Greeks to resist their foreign foes . Christianity also furthered the assimilation of the barbarians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture from within . In the West , where the collapse of the old order went farthest , the Christian Church was the conserver of most of what passed over to future generations from Greece and Rome . It tutored the barbarians not only in its faith but also in fragments of the literatures , the arts , the philosophies , and the laws of the past . More than any other institution connected with that disappearing world it survived . Christianity not only displayed sufficient vitality to persist . It also won the barbarians and entered more potently into the fresh cultures which they created than it had ever succeeded in doing in the decaying culture of the Grxco-Roman world . Indeed , largely because of Christianity the disappearance of the ancient world proved fortunate for the race . Except for Christianity , as we have suggested , creative vitality had largely  | gone out of that world . Outside of what was traceable to the Christian impulse , little new was being said . Men were repeating the old philosophic formulx , were wedded to the old traditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wooden manner what had come down to them from a great past . A certain gain accrued from the loosening of the hand of this magnificent but now moribund culture from so much of Europe and from the consequent freedom again to become creative . It was chiefly because of Christianity that the peoples of Europe were able to utilize the situation to the future advantage of themselves and of the race . Through Christian institutions , Christian clergy , and Christian monks came most of whatever passed over from the old to the new From Jesus , moreover , through Christianity was derived the impulse which led to the creation of much that was finest 1n the new in thought , in literature , and in art , and which by its high moral ideals troubled the conscience of the IteOpI ( ? s who built the new cultures and haunted and inspired them with a vision of what human life might mean . In its first five centuries , the impulse whose source was Jesus had an amazing effect . It became the novel and dominant delimit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destroyed all the non-Christian religions of the Greco-Roman world except its own parent stock , Judaism . Never in so brief a time has so thoroughgoing a religious revolution been wrought in so large a proportion of civilized mankind . This impulse from Jesus , too , brought into existence the Christian Church , the Christian sacraments and liturgies , Christian theologies , and an extensive art and literature . Upon non-religious phases of Grxco-Roman life ,  | however , its effects , while by no means negligible , were not so marked as they were to be upon similar phases of culture in later ages . The achievement of Jesus iii these first five centuries was important and basic , but upon society as a whole the influence of Jesus was later to be much greater . It has increased with each age .  | BEGINNING with the fifth century came a series of crises which seemed to threaten the very existence of Christianity and so to put an end to the influence of Jesus . The Empire and the civilization with which Christianity had come to be identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed about to destroy itself by its very success . It had performed the amazing feat of penetrating the Gr ecoRoman world and of working momentous changes in GracoRoman culture . By the close of the fifth century the vast majority of the population of the Roman Empire professed to be followers of Jesus . I lowever , the influence of Jesus was still confined la gely to that Empire . To be sure , here and there outside the Roman boundaries Christian communities existed , some of them fairly strong . In the Caucasus , notably in Georgia , their were Christians . Armenia was officially ( li isti:i . In Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the realm of the Persian mortal ( hs Christians were numerous ? although subject . to severe persecutions . On the fringes of Arabia , in Ethiopia , and itt some centres in India were Christian communities , several of them fairly large and having the support of the local princes . In the West , Christianity had spread into Ireland and possibly into what is now Scotland beyond the Roman limes . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had begun in so humble and obscure a fashion should in so brief a time have won even the nominal al-  | legiance of the largest and strongest centre of human civilization and should have spilled over its borders . Yet because of the place of its birth and the comparatively brief time in which it had been in existence , the influence of Jesus was still chiefly restricted geographically to the Roman Empire . By winning that Empire Christianity seemed to other peoples to be part and parcel of Graco-Roman culture . Indeed , it was in connexion with that culture and with the commercial or political outreach of the Roman Empire that Christianity had made most of its gains outside the basin of the Mediterranean . Now , commencing in the fifth century , this Empire and this culture with which the influence of Jesus had come to be so closely associated began visibly to break up . As we have seen , the seeds of decay had long been present . Internally the Grxco-Roman world had for many years been far from robust . In the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside which aggravated the weakness . They were especially acute from the fifth into the tenth century , but they continued intermittently into the sixteenth century . Indeed , some of the most threatening were in the thirteenth , fourteenth , and fifteenth centuries . The story of these invasions is one of the commonplaces of history . In the fifth century various Germanic peoples , some of them for a time serving in the Roman legions , broke into the Greco-Roman world and hewed out for themselves states within the Roman borders . In the fifth century came Attila and his Huns . From north of the Caspian issued the Alani . In the sixth century the Teutonic Lombards subdued much of Italy . In the sixth century the Avars established themselves in central Europe and repeatedly raided some of the former Roman territory in western Europe and what sur-  | vived of Roman power in the Balkan Peninsula . In the seventh century Slavic peoples were overrunning the Balkans and filtering into Greece . In that century , too , the Bulgars , originally from Asia , tore from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state which was to endure for many generations . In the seventh century came the Arabs . In the course of a few decades they conquered Syria , Palestine , Egypt , North Africa , most of Spain ( all of which had once been under Roman control ) , and , eliminating the Sassanian dynasty , made themselves masters of Mesopotamia and Persia , where Christians were numerous . Beginning with the close of the eighth century Scandinavians began the Viking raids . Down into the tenth century these wasted much of western Europe , ravaged Italy , and were carried even to the walls of Constantinople ? areas within the borders of Christendom and of Grieco-Roman culture . In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the Seljuk Turks became formidable in the Near Fast . In the thirteenth century the Mongol irruption begun . Before the close of the fifteenth century it had done damage to ( istian conununities in Russia and had brought disaster to the churches iii central Asia . In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Ottoman Turks arose to prominence in Asia Minor , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronan name . In the fourteenth century they haul begun the acquisition of territory in southeastern Europe . I n the l i l t cen th century they erased the remnants of the Byzaut inc Empire , for a thousand years a bulwark of Christianity and of Greek culture . In the sixteenth century again and again they menaced the states of western Europe . Most of these invaders were non-Christian . Several of the Germanic peoples who constituted the major threat in the fifth century were , even before their conquests , professedly  | Christian . When they entered Italy some of the Lombards were probably of that faith . A few anion ; the Mongols had been baptized . However , the others tcrt e non-Christian . Huns , Alani , Avars , Slays , Bulgars , Scandinavians , and , at the outset , most of the Mongols were frankly pagan and , except the Mongols , often seemed to take asp i , tl delight in destroying Christian shrines and monasteries lot these contained much of the wealth for which they were greedy ? and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially their tradition of war of ruthless plunder and c mintiest , were utterly antagonistic to the spirit of Jesus . If they professed to accept him , as many later did , it would be long if ever before they submitted themselves to him in any thoroughgoing fashion and always he would create a tension between himself and many of their hereditary mores . The Arabs , the Seljuk Turks , and the Ottoman Turks were even more of a menace . They were adherents and champions of Islam , and Islam , while in its way paying honour to Jesus , professed to have a later revelation of God and saw in Mohammed the unique prophet of God . Only occasionally did they compel Christians to become Moslems , but they placed the followers of Jesus under such financial and social disabilities that the latter apostatized in large numbers , and where it had a sympathetic government to enforce it Moslem law made it almost impossible for a follower of the Prophet to change his allegiance and become a disciple of the Christ . The crude polytheism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the conflict with Islam it was usually Christianity which suffered . In face of these threats could the influence of Jesus endure ? Did it possess sufficient vitality to survive the death of the ' calm and the culture with which it had seemed to be amal-  | gamated ? Could it win and transform the peoples who contributed to the destruction of that realm and whose hereditary ideals so contravened what Jesus had taught and was ? Would the name Christian be identified with dwindling fragments of peoples and cultures in which persisted something of the tradition of the Roman Empire and of Graeco-Roman culture ? What assurance could be given that Christianity would not share the fate of the religions which it had supplanted in the Graeco-Roman world and that it would not go the way of Zoroastrianism and of Manich2ism , the one to-day represented only by small groups and the other only a memory ? It is highly significant that instead of dying out , in the thousand years after A.D. 500 the influence of Jesus continued to spread and to make itself felt more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . In spite of times of crisis and discouragement , measured by the centuries , both in its geographic extent and in its effect upon the cultures of mankind it gained rather than lost . To be sure , in some areas Christianity declined in numerical strength and in places disappeared , but , although slowly yielding ground , in most of even these regions the influence of Jesus survived . For this persistence and growth a number of factors are in part responsible . The fact that Christianity was the faith of the cultured populations of the Mediterranean basin partly accounts for its adoption by the peoples of northern Europe . Barbarians that they were , the invaders from the North accepted it along with whatever else they took over of the civilization of the South . The existence in western Europe of the most vigorous strain of Christianity ? the Christianity by which has been accomplished most of the expansion of the faith since 1500 ? is in part attributable to the fact that the  | area was relatively sheltered from the successive invasions of non-Christian folk which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , in central Asia , and iii China was to some degree because that faith had the good fortune to be strong among the mercantile classes of Mesopotamia who made their way along the trade routes to these far places . However , apart from qualities inherent in Jesus , these causes would not have brought about this result . It is provocative of thought that geographic situation is not enough to account for the fact that the greatest extension of Christianity has come from western Europe . After all , western Europe had been much more recently won to the faith than had eastern Europe and Asia Minor . In it the collapse of civilization was more complete than in the East . It seems that in the impulse from Jesus is a vitality which often is strongest where the emergency is greatest and where the outlook seems most dark . In Europe it was again and again Christian missionaries and the Christian Church which became the vehicle for the transmission to the barbarians of whatever of Graco-Roman culture survived . Christianity did not endure just because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over because it was associated with Christianity . The vitality of western European Christianity was not due merely to the comparative freedom from attack from Asia . It was also the result of the fact that the Roman state collapsed more fully there than in the East and left the Church , as the institutional expression of Christianity , more nearly untrammeled than in the East and so snore free to interpret the spirit of Jesus without restraint by a state of pre-Christian origin . Moreover , the survival Id growth of the Church in areas where the state perished  | was in some degree evidence of the universality of the appeal ? to the untutored barbarian as well as to the civilized Greek and Roman ? of the message of which the Church was the guardian . As to the spread of Christianity along trade routes by merchants from Mesopotamia , such scanty records as we have of the exact process of that expansion indicate that professional missionaries whose motive was not commercial , but a consuming zeal for their faith , had no small part in the outcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus which appealed to the best in men , it was a correspondence of Jesus to the something in the nature of the universe in which men find themselves and of which they are the product , which must be held responsible for the wide diffusion of the faith which claimed him as its central figure . Even in the briefest possible summary , the story of the expansion of the Christian faith in these centuries can not but be impressive . It bears witness to the power of the impulse which came from Jesus that most of the active missionaries of these centuries were monks ? and monks , it will be recalled , were those who devoted themselves more wholeheartedly to Jesus than did the great run of professing Christians . The monastic movement , it will be remembered , had begun in the third century , only a few generations before the disasters which dealt such severe blows to the Roman Empire and so to the Christian Church . As our study continues , we shall see that in connexion with each major threat to the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to Jesus which have gained such power from fresh contact with him that they have carried the Christian faith on to new victories and to an unprecedented geographic extension and influence in the life of men .  | The Celts of Ireland adopted Christianity in the centuries in which Roman rule and culture were collapsing in their nearest neighbour , the island of Great Britain . In communities of monks who had given themselves fully to the new way of life a knowledge of Latin and even something of ( ; reek were cherished as a means of studying the Christian writings . In a dark age Irish monasteries were centres of religion and learning . From these monasteries went out monks , often in bands of twelve in imitation of the Apostles of Jesus . The Irish peregrini did much to win to the faith the pagans of Scotland and of a large proportion of England , were the first Christian missionaries in many sections of the continent of Europe , and raised the level of the Christianity in Gaul , depressed as it had been in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued that region . Gregory the Great , one of the ablest and most wholehearted in devotion to Jesus of those who have occupied the Papal chair , sent a band of monks as missionaries to the Anglo-Saxons  --  Germanic invaders who had wiped out Christianity and Roman culture in the East of Britain . Partly as a result of the labours of these men and their successors , also sent by the See of Peter , the Anglo-Saxons were brought to the Christian faith . Through the strength of the impulse which came from Jesus , Rome effected a spiritual conquest of the island which proved more lasting and had even more enduring results than had the material conquest made by the legions of the Roman C ( ( esars . From the English in the early flush of their enthusiasm for the Christian faith went monks to some of the Germanic peoples on the adjacent parts of the continent of Europe . Villibrord and his colleagues in the Netherlands , Boniface and the associates whom he inspired and led in much of  | Germany and then at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of inducing many from the Teutonic peoples of these regions to accept baptism . Moreover , Boniface reformed the church of the Carolingian Empire and helped to call it to a nearer approximation of the standards set by Jesus . In the nominal conversion of the pagan Saxons , Charlemagne used force . Never before , indeed , had armed might been so baldly employed to bring about a formal acceptance of the Christian name . As yet the rulers of the warlike Germanic peoples and the masses of their followers had been only superficially caught by the Christian faith . However , in the entourage of Charlemagne was at least one devoted and learned follower of Jesus who had the courage to declare that careful instruction should be a prerequisite for baptism . Moreover , preceding or accompanying the arms of Charlemagne and entering the doors which he so violently opened , came missionaries who by humble and devoted living and persistent teaching strove to make real the adoption of the faith whose outward symbols had been imposed by blood and fire . By the close of the twelfth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the barbaric Teutonic folk to lay waste the cultivated South , had given their allegiance to the Christian name . The ancestral paganism of the Vikings who journeyed overseas disintegrated in contact with professedly Christian folk . For a time many of the Northmen were in a twilight zone between their hereditary gods and the white Christ . In the end they all adopted the faith of the Christians whom they had conquered . Those Northmen who remained at home became Christian . Many of these were brought forcibly to the baptismal font by rulers  | who used the new faith as a tool for enhancing the royal power . Always , however , devoted missionaries , often monks , preceded or accompanied the energetic monarchs or followed them with more careful instruction . Christianity even pursued the Norse settlers to Iceland and Greenland and won them . In central Europe , in what is now northeastern Germany , and in much of the Balkans , Christianity spread among the Slavic peoples who there formed the mass of the population . More than in most regions it was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives , and by several different methods , some of them quite antagonistic to the spirit of Jesus . In parts of the later Jugoslavia and Czechoslovakia numbers of the agents were Germans , some ecclesiastics and some civil rulers , who appear to have been moved as much by the desire to extend German power as to propagate the Christian faith . Yet in a large part of this region the missionaries best remembered and most honoured were two representatives of Greek Christianity , Constantine ( or Cyril ) and Methodius , who seem to have been impelled primarily by a religious impulse . More than any others , they laid the foundations of Slavic Christianity , and their efforts later bore fruit , not only in central Europe but also in the Balkans and even in Russia . In northeastern Germany among the Wends , as the Slays were there denominated , force was much employed . German rulers ( and , in Pomerania for a time , Polish princes ) were endeavouring to extend their dominion over the Wends and to this end initiated or endorsed Christian missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the missionaries , mostly monks , by whom the patient labour of instruction was performed , eschewed or deplored violent measures . So Bishop Otto of Bamberg , the most prominent  | of those who planted the faith among the Pomeranians , while taking advantage of the moral support of secular monarchs and going on his mission with circumstance and pomp , did not actually defend himself by force or employ soldiers to bring to the baptismal font those whom he was seeking . Through much of the land of the Wends , however , Christianity did not finally prevail until German settlers constituted the dominant portion of the population . In Russia , as in so many other parts of the world , a mass conversion was led by a secular prince , in this case Vladimir of Kiev , of Scandinavian descent but ruling chiefly over Slays . He and his successors were assisted by clergy from the Byzantine realms , and much use was made of the literature prepared by those who followed in the tradition of Constantine and Methodius . The conversion of the Magyars was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who seems to have been sincere in his faith , but astutely used it , as did some of the Scandinavian missionary-kings , as a tool for curbing the power of local magnates and augmenting the royal authority . I-Iere , too , the efforts of the secular ruler were supplemented by those of missionary monks who instructed the populace and made the Church a living reality . The Bnlgars and the Slavic majority who were subject to them also adopted the Christian faith under the leadership of a secular ruler . In this instance , however , the prince , Boris , probably took the initial step under constraint , as a condition of peace in an unsuccessful war with a Byzantine emperor . Here , as was the case in many other lands , the instruction of the masses was the work of earnest missionaries whose primary interest was religious , not political . In regions on the Baltic , the present Finland , Latvia ,  | Esthonia , East Prussia , and Lithuania , Christianity was late in gaining acceptance . It then came largely as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Esthonia , Danish , German , and Swedish imperialism each had a share . In Latvia and East Prussia Germans were the active agents , chiefly through two crusading orders , the Knights of the Sword and the Teutonic Knights . In Lithuania , the last of these lands to become officially Christian , the ambitions of the Teutonic Knights complicated the process , and the baptism of the ruler which became the opening wedge for the conversion of the masses was carried through as part of the price of a Polish alliance against the Knights . Yet in all these lands clergy entered , chiefly monks , at first largely Cistercians and later mostly Franciscans and Dominicans . These orders were the fruits of revivals of devotion to the Christian ideal and of attempts to carry out fully the commands of Jesus . It was by them that most of the instruction of the populace in the tenets of the faith was accomplished . It was not only in Europe that the Christian faith extended its borders in these thousand years . For a time , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Constantinople ) under the Emperor Justinian , it also spread in what are now Tunis and Algeria . Under the initiative , too , of Justinian and of his empress , Theodora , it moved farther up the Nile into portions of Nubia . In Nubia , indeed , for several centuries it made progress and yielded only slowly to Islam . Presumably the advance was in part the consequence of political factors and in part of commercial contacts with Christians from Egypt . However , we know that in the beginnings of the conversion of the region the agents were clergy  | in whom was a strong religious impulse which was due , ultimately , to Jesus . In Asia east of Mesopotamia the faith was carried far . On the shores of the Caspian , in the valley of the Oxus , north and east of the Oxus , in Chinese Turkestan , in India , and even in China proper , Christian communities existed . Some of these were composed of Christian merchants from Mesopotamia and their descendants and others had these mercantile communities as their original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still others were the fruits of missions which had in them neither the political nor the economic motive . Various types of Christianity were represented ? Jacobite , Monophysite , Greek Orthodox , Nestorian , and Roman Catholic . Nestorianism was the most prominent , but in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries a great burst of renewed life in Roman Catholic Christianity sent Dominicans and Franciscans into western and central Asia and India , and Franciscans even as far as China . In most of this expansion of Christianity , it must be reiterated , the impulse which came from Jesus was only one of several factors . The faith was propagated from a number of motives , some of them political , some of them associated with the conquest and colonization of an area by peoples whose official faith was Christianity , and some commercial . So , too , its acceptance was from a mixture of motives . Sometimes it was in part from a desire to conform to what appeared a superior culture with which Christianity was closely associated . Sometimes it was from a conviction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old faiths and was a better means than the old religions of obtaining what these latter had promised . Sometimes baptism  | was received from conquerors as the price of peace and the badge of submission . In very few of the converts was there at the outset much comprehension of the purport of the life , teachings , death , and resurrection of Jesus . Occasionally something of this came in the first generation of Christians . Here and there it was strong in the second and third generations of Christians . More often it came slowly . Only in the course of centuries did an understanding of Jesus penetrate even to a large minority . That which bore the Christian name was a compound of what had come from Jesus and of other , often contradictory elements . Yet always where Christianity took firm root some of the agents were men who had been caught by Jesus , even though they imperfectly understood him . Because of their devotion to him and the message concerning him they were giving themselves to helping others to the new life which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , the commercial expansion , the conquest and exploitation of one people by another , and the extension of the power of kings over the local magnates would have taken place had Jesus never lived . Without him their precise forms might have been different , and in some instances they might not have occurred , but that in one guise or another most of them would have happened can not well be doubted . Certainly they have been features of human history in lands and in periods where nothing of Jesus has ever been known . What Jesus did was to modify these phases of human development , to inject into them elements peculiar to himself and which but for him would not have been present . Among many of these peoples great souls arose who left a marked impress on their fellows , and who were palpably different  | and lifted out of the usual to the unusual because of what had come to them from Jesus . So , too , as we are to see in a moment , elements appeared in a number of cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we have hinted , during these thousand years in some areas Christianity , and with it much or all of the influence of Jesus , died out . In China proper it twice disappeared ? in the ninth or tenth century , after being present for two or three centuries , and in the fifteenth or sixteenth century after its reintroduction in the thirteenth century . In much of central Asia the Mongol wars of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , although of some help for a brief time , dealt it severe blows , wiping it out in some places and weakening it in others . The greatest losses were suffered through Islam . In lands where Moslems long held rule the Christian communities shrank in numbers and in several places completely disappeared . Yet Christianity possessed such vitality that in some regions it persisted in the face of the dominant Islam and in Spain and Sicily it regained ground which had once been lost . Nowhere else in any one land before any other religion has Islam lost so much territory where it has once been long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some places the persistence of Christianity was in part because racial particularism reinforced religious faith in resistance to assimilation . In Spain the elimination of Islam was effected by armed force , political measures , and , eventually , the expulsion of those who were accused of mixing Moslem practices with the Christianity which had been imposed on them . Yet in Christianity was a vitality which nerved the minorities to preserve their existence and which gave them cohesion ,  | and which impelled the Spanish warriors to the conquest of the Moor and the Spanish monarchs to the enforcement of religious uniformity . Good or bad , praiseworthy or to be deplored , it was unquestionably potent . In spite of losses , as we have suggested , in Anno Domini 1500 Christianity , and , accordingly , the influence of Jesus , extended over a much wider area than in Anno Domini 500 . In 1500 the numbers of professed Christians may not have been any greater than in the year 500 . At the close of the fifteenth century the most powerful state on the planet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominally Christian . In political power no one of the Christian kingdoms could equal in area or in military might either the Moslem Ottoman Empire or the Confucian Empire of China . Yet Christianity had spread to more peoples and lands than knew it at the close of the fifth century and upon at least one culture , that of western Europe , it had left a deeper impress than it had been able to make upon that of the Graeco-Roman world . In the thousand years between A.D. 500 and A.D. 1500 the effect of the impulse which came from Jesus in the lands where Christianity existed varied much more from area to area and from culture to culture than in the first five centuries . This was because of the wider geographical extent of the influence of Jesus and , in consequence , of the greater variety of conditions under which it operated . In China , although conjectures to the contrary are not lacking , we can prove no permanent effect upon culture . This , however , may be because our knowledge is so scanty . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any influence has persisted from the faith which once was professed by many in that region . In India what are known as the Syrian Christians were  | then in existence . Their faith gave them cohesion , helped to mould their customs , and was the major factor in preventing the absorption of their communities by the surrounding peoples and the prevailing Hinduism . Among minorities in Mesopotamia , in Armenia , in the Caucasus , on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean , and in Egypt , Christianity was a means of preserving cultural independence and group consciousness . Through it the impulse which came from Jesus helped to shape their customs and the lives of many individuals . In all of them monasticism existed , and that movement , as we must again remind ourselves , was in part the product of an effort to carry out completely the commands of Jesus and to seek the salvation which it was believed had come through him . Upon the victorious Islam Jesus made an impression . Mohammed knew of him and repeatedly mentioned him , as may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prophet had little precise information about him and Islam as it is represented in the Koran was at the beginning little if any different because of Jesus than it would have been without him . As Moslems came into more intimate touch with Christians the impact of Jesus upon Islam increased . An indirect but important contribution was the introduction of Moslem Arabs to Greek philosophy . This came through the Nestorian Christians of Mesopotamia who first put into Arabic some of the writings of the great Greek minds . But for Jesus the Nestorian communities would not have existed , and while no one ought to speak confidently of what would have happened under other circumstances , it is hard to see how without them the Arabs would have been brought into touch with Greek thought . Certainly they could not have done so  | through Zoroastrianism , the prevailing faith in Persia at the time of the Arab conquest . Moreover , it was by Christian artisans in Egypt that much of what is distinctive in Moslem Arab art and architecture was developed ? although it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians . It seems to be significant that Moslem culture had its great flowering in the centuries in which Mohammedans were in intimate touch with strong Christian communities and that the centuries of its sterility were those in which the Christian communities , under Moslem pressure , had dwindled to relatively small , encysted minorities , too intent on preserving their own existence and too corrupted by the influence of Moslem rulers in the choice of their leading ecclesiastics to have a creative cultural life . It is a fair guess , although one against which much can be argued and which has certainly not been conclusively demonstrated , that through the impulse from Jesus came that which stirred Moslems to cultural creativeness and that without this impulse the fatalism of Islam condemned the followers of the Prophet to the repetition of old cultural forms and to cultural stagnation and decay . The most direct contribution of Jesus to the religious life of Moslems was through Sufism . Sufism , that vigorous form of Moslem mysticism with its frequently accompanying asceticism , is deeply indebted to Christian monasticism . Christian monasticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively the product of Jesus . Into it had entered other elements . To Christian mysticism , moreover , Neoplatonism had contributed . Since , however , loyalty to Jesus was the central cause of the monastic movement , the impulse from Jesus entered into the formation of Sufism . In the East the chief culture in which Christianity was  | prominent was that of the Byzantine Empire . Here the influence of Jesus was always much restricted . Byzantine civilization was a continuation , without any sharp break or fresh beginning , of that of the Greece and Rome of pre-Christian days . While upon later stages of Graco-Roman culture Christianity had made an impression , this was chiefly in the religious realm . Moreover , in the Byzantine domains the Constantinian tradition was continued and strengthened that the Church must be ancillary to the state and controlled by it . Christianity succeeded the old polytheism as the state religion , and the tendency was , therefore , to make of the Church an organ of the state . In general , the impulse from Jesus seems to have freer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it and professing to be the " body " of Jesus , than through the state , which has a different origin . To be sure , the Church has often in practice been a negation of much for which Jesus stood and the secular rulers , when professedly Christian , have repeatedly modified the state in ways which are traceable to Jesus . Yet , with exceptions , the generalization has held true that Jesus has been the most potent in lands where the Church which stems from him has been the least trammelled by dictation by the state . In spite of the dominance of the state , Christianity , and so Jesus , had an effect in a number of phases of Byzantine life . The laws bear evidence of an increasing tendency to take account of that faith . In the sixth century the Institutes of Justinian show innovations in the regulation of marriage , in respect to chastity , and relating to the exposure of infants , which are in the direction of the ethics of Jesus . In the Ecloga , about two centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity and points were often sup-  | ported by citations from the Christian Scriptures . The Ecloga penalized fornication . Perhaps to Christian influence was due the laying down of equal punishments for rich and poor , commoner and noble , in contrast with the partiality shown by the Justinian code to members of the upper classes . In the Basilics , of the latter part of the ninth century , or more than a century after the Ecloga , the first book is devoted to Christian doctrine and three books are assigned to ecclesiastical law . Much that is most characteristic of Byzantine art was the fruit of the Christian impulse . The Byzantine church buildings and the mosaics which adorned them bear especially the stamp of the faith in whose honour they came into being . A very large proportion of Byzantine literature was religious or was strongly impregnated with religion , and so was indebted to Jesus . The great minds of the Byzantine world ? and during much of the thousand years between A.D. 500 and A.D. 1500 Constantinople was the centre of the most cultivated society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek philosophy was still cherished , but the outlook on the universe was largely determined by the fact of Jesus and by the central place which he was believed to hold in the life of mankind and in God 's dealing with the human race . Monasticism flourished . It was more quietistic than that of the West and took a less active part in shaping society outside monastic walls . However , at times monks vigorously participated in the affairs of state . This was particularly true in the Iconoclastic Controversy ? when the entire realm was thrown into turmoil over the attempts of emperors to eliminate images from the churches . In general the monks supported the icons . Whether in doing so they exemplified the  | spirit of Jesus may be open to debate , but they were at least evidence of an independence which refused submission to secular authorities in an issue in which they believed the honour of Jesus and especially of the mother of Jesus was at stake . Among the barbarians north of the Byzantine Empire , the Church became a tutor not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . We have seen that Constantine and Methodius , Byzantine scholar-missionaries , prepared an alphabet for the Slays and inspired the beginnings of a literature in Slavonic . Mediums of writing and literacy are not in themselves always undiluted blessings . They may even bring harm . Yet they have been essential concomitants of any high civilization . In reducing languages to writing , missionaries have been moved chiefly by the desire to make available Christian literature and so to introduce men to the new life made possible through Jesus and to help them to grow in it . It was thus that this early Slavic literature came into existence . Upon what eventually became the most powerful of the Slavic peoples , the Russians , Christianity was slow in having much effect . Areas were vast , missionaries were comparatively few , the superficial conversion of the masses was long in becoming more than nominal , and the average parish priest was grossly ignorant . For a time , too , the Mongol conquest worked havoc . Moreover , the Byzantine tradition of the subordination of the Church to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrated to the masses , gripped their imagination , and profoundly modified their life . Into the folklore came something of an understanding of Jesus , sometimes in the form of stories which represented him as a wanderer whom the rich refused to receive and who , given hospitality by the poor , rewarded his hosts . The Christian  | faith , too , early mitigated the lot of the slave . By draining swamps , by clearing virgin lands , and by introducing better breeds of cattle and improved methods of cultivating the soil , Christian monasteries became centres of culture . On the northern frontiers monks taught their converts new methods of fishing and of agriculture . The Church was the channel for the introduction into Russia of various contributions from Byzantine culture ? in law , in art , and in literature . The Russian alphabet came through the Church and by way of Bulgaria from the alphabets prepared by early missionaries to the Slays . In all of these , obviously , the Russians were indebted directly or indirectly to Jesus . It was on western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the impulse derived from Jesus made its deepest impression between the fifth and the sixteenth centuries . The reasons for this we have seen ? the greater disintegration of Roman rule and of Gra:co-Roman culture in the West than in the East , and a geography which gave protection against some of the most destructive of the invasions . The more pronounced disintegration of Roman civil authority in the West left the Church the strongest institution and the most prominent conservator of the old culture . Thanks to its structure and to its missionaries , the Church extended over all of western Europe at a time when politically that region was divided into many kingdoms and principalities . The Church of the West was not solely the result of the impulse from Jesus . It was in part the creation of the Roman genius for government and in it was incorporated something of the ideals and spirit of imperial Rome . Yet the Church of Rome owed its place in the imagination of the peoples of western and especially of northwestern Europe to the fact that it was believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus and that its head was the vice-gerent of Christ . Rome , too , as a city attracted and fascinated pilgrims , not because of its imposing ruins of ancient political power , but because of its Christian shrines and its memories of Peter and Paul and of Christian martyrs . The Church owed its hold to the belief that it was the chosen channel for that grace of God in Christ which made possible the eternal salvation of man . What led to the Church 's expansion into regions which had never seen the standards of the Roman legions was chiefly the labours of missionaries who were impelled by their devotion to the Christian Gospel . As the most extensive strong institution in the West the Church naturally made a deep impression on the peoples and the culture of that region . The greater weakening of Grzeco-Roman culture in the West than in the East left more room for a fresh beginning . On a new culture in whose development the Church shared from the start , the Christian spirit , of which the Church was so largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert a more effective influence than upon one which was already well formed and had , indeed , begun to ossify when Christianity was born . Yet , we need to remind ourselves , the Church could not have taken advantage of this opportunity had it not been for its inherent vitality . That vigour , we can scarcely remind ourselves too often , came from convictions about Jesus which brought the Church into existence and accorded it a continuing grip upon the minds and hearts of men . It is true that the geographic location of western Europe at the extreme end of the Euro-Asiatic continent gave comparative security from foreign invasion and so ensured a certain freedom from interruption in the building of a new  | culture . However , that quiet must not be exaggerated . To those who recall the chronic internal turmoil of the Middle Ages the very word " quiet " must seem ironic . War was the normal condition of medieval Europe . Except for the Christian clergy , warriors were the dominant class . Yet , from the European standpoint , the wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in southern Gaul , in Sicily , and in southern Italy were the Moslem Arabs a serious menace . By the twelfth century the Viking incursions had ceased ? largely because of the conversion of the Northmen . The Mongols terrified western Europe but did not penetrate beyond Poland . The Ottoman Turks were a threat but never carried the Crescent farther than Austria . In contrast with western Europe , eastern areas where Christianity was present knew both internal dissensions and foreign invasions . Beginning with the seventh century the Christian communities there were constantly on the defensive against the Moslem and suffered from the slow attrition of Islam . On the other hand , after the eleventh century ( save possibly in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries ) western Europe was never seriously menaced by a non-Christian invader . Its wars were domestic , except on its borders and then usually when it was the aggressor , and its internal conflicts were between professing Christians . Yet freedom from foreign invasion does not alone ensure the emergence of a new and worthy culture . For centuries the aborigines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impinged upon by aliens , but they did not employ the opportunity as did the peoples of medieval Europe . Climate and race were probably favourable , but by themselves are insufficient to account for the result . GrxcoRoman culture contributed much , but came directly or indirectly through Christian channels and was stronger in a realm  | which produced less that was new , the Byzantine Empire . The determinative factor was Christianity and the Christian Church , and , back of these , Jesus . Obviously Jesus was not the only source of the civilization of western Europe . Upon that civilization , however , he had a greater effect than he had exerted upon the culture of the Roman Empire . It is important not only to know that Jesus exerted a greater influence upon the culture of medieval Europe than upon that of the Roman Empire before the year 500 , but also to know the quality of that influence and the phases of culture in which it was strong . As in the Roman Empire , the most marked effect was in the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods which preceded Christianity were swept aside . This in itself was not so noteworthy an achievement as was the similar one in the GrxcoRoman world . The cults which disappeared were associated with what are usually called " lower " or " simpler " cultures and , like the cultures with which they were interrelated , gave way fairly readily before the faith and the civilization of the " more advanced " Mediterranean world . Where , as in Gaul and Italy , they formed a minority of the population , there was nothing particularly remarkable in the adoption by the barbarians of the religion as well as much of the culture of the provinces of the Roman Empire which they occupied . A similar result has repeatedly followed , and with other religions than Christianity , when barbarians have made themselves the political masters of a population with a " higher " culture . It was not even a phenomenon peculiar to Christianity that a religion should be carried by zealous missionaries beyond the traditional bounds of the civilization with  | which it had been affiliated and become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries this was occurring in Japan in connexion with Buddhism and Chinese culture . That Christianity so spread was , to be sure , an indication that it possessed vitality , but the same could be said of other faiths under similar circumstances . The uniqueness of the religious results of Christianity among the Europeans of these thousand years must be sought in other directions . One of the features of the religious effect of Jesus in this period which is not paralleled in the record of other faiths is that increasingly as the centuries passed , Christianity , far from declining in vigour , gave birth to fresh religious movements . Most of these movements consciously took their inspiration from Jesus . Just at the beginning of the period came the inception of the Benedictine rule with its ordered monastic houses . A little later Irish monasticism , a religious awakening , matured in a rich flowering and brought a deeper and more devoted life to many in western Europe . From Irish monasticism sprang the penitentials , used for inducing a closer conformity to Christian ethical practice among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenth century began the Cluny movement , seeking a revival of Christian living in the observance of a modification of the Benedictine rule and in a purging of the clergy and the official structure of the Church from some of their more palpable evils . At the end of the tenth and in the course of the eleventh century came other revivals , also in the guise of new monastic movements ? the Cistercians , the Camaldulians , the Vallombrosians , and the Carthusians . Most of these movements had been led by aristocrats . In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , however , awakenings occurred among humbler classes ? merchants and labourers  | in the towns , and farming folk . In the twelfth century came Peter of Bruys and his followers , professing to base their teaching on the Bible , rejecting the baptism of infants and transubstantiation , and declaring that since prayer could be offered anywhere church buildings were not needed . Also in the twelfth century began the Poor Men of Lyons , having as their founder Peter Waldo , a rich merchant who distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made much of circulating the Scriptures in the vernacular and of a closer adherence to the ethical demands of the New Testament . A little later the Franciscans and Dominicans sprang up , the former begun by the son of a merchant of Assisi who had been caught by what he believed to be the command of Jesus to espouse absolute poverty . He and his Little Brothers preached the gospel of poverty and love and , with the Dominicans , created a great stir among the masses . In the fifteenth century came Wycliffe and the Lollards in England . Slightly after Wycliffe and influenced by him was Huss , the son of a peasant , who began a striking religious awakening in Bohemia . In the fourteenth century flourished the German mystics , who had as one of their fruits The German Theology . As an expression of a combination of mysticism and of insistence upon high ethical standards arose the Brethren of the Common Life , who conducted some of the best schools of their time , and whose most distinguished pupil was Erasmus . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of revivals broke out , unprecedented in extent and power , more wide-spread and more profound than any which Europe had so far known . It is important to note that in western Europe in these thousand years Christianity was stirring the masses more and  | more deeply . In general the movement was from the top down . The conversion of western Europe had been by tribes and communities . Usually rulers had led the way and the masses had followed much as a matter of course but with little insight into the faith which they were adopting . As that faith became better understood and the life and teachings of Jesus were better apprehended , revivals arose , first among the upper classes and then among all classes , including the most lowly . The process differed somewhat from that in the Roman Empire . Here the impulse which came from Jesus early gave birth to many different movements . As the years passed , new ones appeared less frequently . To be sure , they continued to emerge , but not in any such numbers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been due to the fact that at first Christianity was accepted only by a minority . For Christians their faith might at any time mean persecution and they took their beliefs seriously . Then , beginning with Constantine , Christianity became the religion of the Roman state and state support gave the form of Christianity selected as the official church great advantage over its rivals . The emergence of new forms was discouraged . Then , too , in the third century , and especially beginning with Constantine in the fourth century , the masses moved into the Church and partially swamped it . Before they could be really assimilated and the Christian impulse stir them to new movements , the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West and the influx of pagan barbarians halted the process . Not until the barbarians were converted could the vitality inherent in Christianity bring about a fresh stream of revivals . Once the barbarians had formally accepted Christianity , the frequency with which revivals and new movements appeared began to increase .  | Periodically , and with a growing power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faith , through the centuries revivals have again and again broken out . Something in the impulse from Jesus has continued to attract men , to breed in them dissatisfaction with their way of living , to transform them , and to inspire them . This has been true to a degree not equalled in any other religious faith or in any other set of ideas . To be sure , from some other religions new movements have sprung . However , of no other is it true that over so many centuries they have continued to arise with increasing frequency and with a widening circle of influence over more and more men and women . We must , moreover , note in these centuries a flowering of Christian mysticism . As a rule this centred about Jesus and had in him its inspiration . It was because of Jesus that the great mystics felt that they had direct fellowship with God . Nothing which has been said in the past few paragraphs should he allowed to convey the impression that in the western Europe of the Middle Ages what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals of Jesus or was solely the product . of the impulse which came from him . Into popular religion entered some practices from preceding cults . Attitudes of mind carried over from pre-Christian days . The great majority expected of Christianity the kind of results which they had demanded of pre-Christian faiths ? assistance in war , material prosperity , and magical means of furthering their selfish ambitions . To Jesus most of this would have been abhorrent . Increasingly , however , there were those who were aware of the conflict between Jesus and much of current practice in the name of Christianity and the Church . In spite of its weaknesses and frequent departures from Jesus , the  | Church officially taught Christian ethics . It fulminated against pride , envy , unchastity , bitterness , gluttony , avarice , murder , and perjury . Not only did it preach against these sins . It also tried to enforce its prohibitions . Through penance it imposed penalties for departures from its standards . By example , lives which had caught their inspiration from Jesus exposed the laxity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revivals of which we have spoken . Something about Jesus more and more rebuked much in popular and even in official religion and inspired men to hopeful discontent . What of the effect of Jesus through Christianity upon the character of particular individuals in the western Europe of these thousand years ? Immediately scores of names come flooding into one 's memory . Almost at random one chooses from among them a few as examples . There was Gregory the Great , of Roman stock , with the marked administrative gifts that were so often associated with the Roman tradition . His faith led him to join the Benedictine movement , then in the early flush of its youth , and to give his wealth to the poor and to the Church . This attitude of consecration eventually constrained him , reluctantly , to devote his capacity for administration to the Papacy . By this step his talents made themselves felt over a much wider area than would otherwise have been possible . It may be significant of the place that Jesus had in Gregory 's thoughts that when Augustine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated on their outward journey and would have turned back , the words of Jesus about him who puts his hand to the plough and looks back came naturally to the great Pope when he wrote them to go on . Perhaps these words had often strengthened Gregory himself  | when , burdened with the Papacy and with chronic ill health , he longed for the quiet of his monastery . Winfrith , or , to give him the name by which he is better known , Boniface , was probably only a second or third generation Christian . The Christian impulse which had so recently come to his people , those pagan Anglo-Saxons who a few generations before had arrived in Britain as conquering , pillaging settlers , sent him as a boy into a monastery , inspired him to obtain an education , and then impelled him to go to the Continent as a missionary to the Germanic peoples of the Low Countries and the Rhine Valley . To his labours as a missionary he added the burden of the reform of the Church in the Frankish realms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so often lead to pride and arrogance , and while in time holding high ecclesiastical position , he remained humble and without a trace of self-seeking , and was solicitous for the welfare of those who served under him . Living in an age of marked looseness of morals , he had warns friendships with women , but was always chivalrous and was never tainted by the breath of scandal . Courageous and bold as a lion and of a warlike race , at the very last when he faced martyrdom from an onslaught of pagans he restrained his followers from offering armed resistance . Boniface 's favourite disciple , Gregory , was from that Frankish nobility which was so noted for its truculence and profligacy , and yet through Christian nurture and long association with his great master worthily carried on the latter 's tradition . Bernard of Clairvaux , who impressed many of his generation as being the ideal Christian , was of aristocratic stock and never quite escaped from the military spirit and the dogmatic  | arrogance of his class , but he was caught by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable devotion . Raymond Lull , while leading a dissolute life as a courtier , in the act of composing amorous verses was four times arrested by a vision of Jesus on the cross . These brought him to remorse and to a complete commitment to the Christian life . Under the influence of his new purpose he became an ardent and indefatigable advocate of missions to Moslems , wrote much in the field of mysticism , and by using the Catalan language for some of his books was a pioneer in creating for that tongue a literary form . The son of a merchant in one of the smaller of the Italian cities , and in his early youth careless , pleasure-loving , and extravagant , Francis of Assisi founded the Order of Brothers Minor and gave to the world an example of loving selfabandon which has never ceased to exercise a strong attraction . The secret of his transformation and of his later growth is seen in the manner in which , towards the end of his life , there developed in his own body the stigmata , reproductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lives was the exclusive product of the influence of Jesus . Natural disposition , racial inheritance , and cultural environment all had a part . Yet it was the impulse which came from Jesus that lifted them and many others out of mediocrity and gave them the characteristics for which they are most loved and best remembered . The life of medieval Europe offered a series of paradoxical contrasts . On the one hand was exalted mysticism ; on the other were coarseness of speech and gross sensuality . Here was self-denying care for the poor and the ill ; yet here were also disdain for the peasant and callousness towards his sufferings . Ardent admiration for the Virgin was paralleled by  | unabashed licentiousness . Admiration for the ascetic and the great appeal of those who , like Francis of Assisi , had given up all earthly goods for the sake of God existed side by side with flaunting luxury and physical self-indulgence . Devotion for the afflicted was matched by almost constant war and the exaltation of the military class . In the same century ribald scepticism flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems of theology . On the one hand were the sacraments and a deep feeling for them ; on the other were parodies of them . Often the contrast was between individuals ? the great saint and the obvious sinner ? but at times the contradictions were seen in the same person . What seems to have happened was the creation by Jesus of a sharp tension . On the one side were the raw traits of human nature seen in peoples only slightly removed from barbarism , whose traditional simpler cultures had been destroyed by contact with the civilized South and who were still overawed by what had filtered through to them from Greece and Rome and had not yet fully assimilated it . The acceptance even of Chi istianity was for the majority nominal and the changes wrought superficial . On the other side was Jesus and all that came from him , much of it in complete contradiction to the barbarians ' past , attracting men , but disquieting their consciences , arousing both greater fears and higher hopes than they had yet known ? fears of eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and His saints . Never during the Middle Ages was the tension resolved . Indeed , it is still with us . How far did this tension issue in the transformation of culture ? In what respects were particular phases of the civilization of medieval Europe , aside from religion and the religious life , the result of what had come from Jesus ?  | As we have said , Jesus left a deep impress on many more sides of the culture of medieval Europe than he did upon Greco-Roman civilization of the fourth and fifth centuries . In the realm of the intellect the influence of Jesus was profound . Through monasteries and schools the Church became the preserver of much of Greek and Latin literature . Many leading Christians looked askance at the old authors as pagans and the conveyors of pagan ideas , but ecclesiastical agencies were chiefly responsible for such study of classical writers as was perpetuated in western and particularly in northern Europe . North of the Alps most of such formal education as existed owed its inception to the Church . North of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we have hinted before and as we shall have occasion to say again , something in the genius of Christianity has seemed to encourage learning . Repeatedly ecclesiastical dignitaries and even whole sections of the Church have been intellectually obscurantist and have been so in the alleged defence of their faith . Fully as frequently , however , the faith of Christians has led them to found and conduct schools and to initiate literatures . Particularly notable was the effect of Jesus upon the subject and the content of the thought of the great minds of medieval Europe . Theology , the study of God , was made " the queen of the sciences . " God , as the creator and sustainer of the universe , the author of human life , the saviour of men , and the inspirer of the redeemed , was held to be the most important subject of scholarship . So , too , as an integral part of this , the drama of human existence engaged man 's imagination ? the creation of man , the fall , the preparation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish people and the lawgivers and prophets , redemption  | through the incarnation , life , death , and resurrection of Jesus , the new birth through the Holy Spirit , the return of the Christ and the Last Judgment , and hell and heaven . All this not only entered into the warp and woof of popular religion , but also fascinated and inspired the best minds . This is not the place to sketch the history of thought during the Middle Ages . In it were elements additional to those historically derived from Jesus . Greek philosophy was of great importance . A fresh ferment of thought had as one of its chief sources the contact with Aristotle which came partly through Moslems , much as Aristotle and other Greek thinkers had earlier been made available to the Moslem Arabs by Nestorian Christians . We must reiterate , however , that central in all this thought was God and the salvation which He had wrought for men through Jesus . To this Greek philosophy was always ancillary . In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it became one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek thought within the Christian revelation . Very significant . was the contribution to thought of the religious revivals which owed their impulse to a desire more perfectly to obey the commands of Jesus . That revival which found expression the Benedictine rule and its monasteries issued in part . iii the preservation of much of ancient literature and in a new type of education . The quickening of religious life through the Irish monasteries was accompanied by better schools than much of western Europe had known since the collapse of the Roman regime . The intellectual awakening under Charlemagne in part arose from the ecclesiastical reforms of Boniface and had as its outstanding exponents and leaders those trained in monastic and church schools . The most extensive revivals of all , those associated  | with the rise of the mendicant orders , had particularly marked intellectual results . The Franciscans and Dominicans early established themselves in some of the universities and contributed to their growth . In these orders , too , were several of the most creative minds of medieval Europe ? Roger Bacon , Bonaventura , Albertus Magnus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , William of Occam . Probably all of these scholars had as a native endowment a superior intellect , but they owed to the religious impulse , to the dedication and inspiration which was derived from Jesus , the initial stimulus and the continuing purpose which aroused and gave direction to their energies . The Renaissance with its attendant and subsequent humanism was indebted to Jesus . To be sure , in some of its manifestations the Renaissance was anti-Christian and in thought and morals glorified ancient paganism . Many of its exponents , while preserving a formal acquiescence to the prevailing Christian faith , were religiously indifferent . Basically , too , humanism tended towards a glorification of man and a reliance upon the human spirit and the human intellect which in some phases left little room for God and for a divine revelation through Jesus . In the Renaissance and in humanism some have seen the beginnings of that departure of many western Europeans from Christianity which has since assumed much greater proportions and which to-day expresses itself in a wide-spread apostasy from Christianity . Yet the thesis has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renaissance was due largely to the Franciscan movement . This , of course , would be to trace it back ultimately to Jesus . It is beyond cavil that many leading humanists were intensely loyal to Jesus and that humanism had an important share in preparing for the revivals in western  | Christianity which are known as the Protestant and Catholic Reformations . The leading humanist of his day , Erasmus , for years laboured for reforms which he hoped would bring Christians nearer to the ideals of Jesus . Zwingli , who made so important a contribution to the early stages of the Reformation and helped prepare the way for Calvinism , came to his distinctive religious convictions by way of humanism . As in the case of so many other tides of the human spirit , the fundamental impulses which gave rise to the Renaissance and humanism are difficult and perhaps impossible to determine with accuracy and finality . Basically , however , neither the Renaissance nor humanism opposed Jesus . In its essence humanism had in it much of that respect for the individual and that appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature Jesus made a profound impression . Many of the stories which passed from mouth to mouth and helped to mould ideals that ran current through the masses centred about Jesus . Thus one of them held up for admiration a knight who , quite contrary to the natural impulse for retaliation , pardoned his father 's murderer when the latter clung to a wayside cross ? the symbol of the death of Jesus for the redemption of men . The Arthurian cycle of stories with its talcs of King Arthur and his knights enjoyed wide circulation and in some of its forms bore the clear impress of those who wished to place on it the Christian stamp . The origin and initial significance of the Grail are in dispute , but eventually the Grail came to be associated with the Last Supper . The tale of Parsifal , which centred about the Grail and stressed the note of redemption and forgiveness after long suffering , bears the indelible mark of meditation upon the meaning of the sufferings and death of Jesus . Much of medieval poetry gives evidence of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed a custom of the Anglo-Saxons in singing improvised poems , but used Biblical themes . The Song of Roland incorporates ideas derived from Christianity . Into some of Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales enter Christian ingredients . Francis of Assisi 's Canticle to the Sun is in rhymed prose and is one of the oldest surviving examples of Italian poetry . Dante 's Divine Comedy is a monument to the effect of Christianity upon genius . The great days of the Christian year and the Gospel story became the occasion for much popular verse in both Latin and the vernacular . Drama , too , obviously owed much to Jesus . The liturgy of the Church , inspired by the death of Jesus , displayed a strong dramatic element . In connexion with Christian festivals popular plays with religious themes came into being . Art and music flourished largely under the of the Church and to a marked degree centred about motifs derived from Christianity . To the extent , therefore , to which Jesus was responsible for the Church and for Christianity he contributed to these phases of medieval culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian monasteries were often the chief havens of the arts . Irish monasteries were noted for the care and skill which went into the illumination of their manuscripts . In the churches , mosaics , stained-glass windows , sculptures , and frescoes had religious themes , and particularly those of Gospel story , the Old Testament , and the lives of the saints . Until the Renaissance , painting dealt primarily with religious subjects and even in Renaissance times continued largely to do so . Gothic architecture has sometimes been called Christian architecture , and its greatest monuments were churches and cathedrals . In connexion with the liturgy music took on distinctive forms .  | Upon the economic life and theory of medieval Europe Jesus indirectly had considerable effect . Monasteries , made up of those who professed to be seeking the salvation of their souls through full obedience to Jesus , were responsible for clearing much of the land and draining many of the swamps of western Europe . This was especially true of the Cistercian houses , with their emphasis upon frugality and manual labour . To monasteries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler handicrafts and many improvements in agriculture and in varieties of fruit and breeds of cattle . The Church officially condemned the taking of interest , but much of the early banking was by ecclesiastical bodies . The Church was the first to accumulate reserves of capital , took the lead in advocating a stable coinage , and initiated the system of deposits . The Templars were famous as bankers . In the theory of property , teachers who professed to be seeking the Christian ideal held that God is the owner of all and that individual men simply hold wealth in trust . Private property there might be , but for the use of their possessions men were responsible to God and must ultimately give an account to I-Iiin . Upon war the influence of Jesus seems to have been contradictory . Wars were fought in his name . From late in the eleventh century until well into the sixteenth century western Europeans accepted in principle the theory of the Crusades ? wars by those who had taken as an emblem the cross of Jesus , waged with the authorization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice-gerent of Christ and the spiritual head of Christendom , and carried on against the enemies of the faith . The most notable of the Crusades were for the purpose of acquiring the control for Christians of the places connected with the birth , life , death , and resurrection  | of Jesus . In the name of Jesus through the Crusades enormities of cruelty were perpetrated with an abandon heightened by religious frenzy . Out of the Crusades military orders arose ? notably the Templars , the Hospitalers , the Teutonic Knights , the Order of Christ ? in which soldiers took monastic vows and dedicated their swords to the cause of Christ . From Bernard of Clairvaux , memorable for his sanctity and his devotion to Jesus , came the initial suggestion for the rule of the Templars . Bernard , too , preached a Crusade . In contrast , at the very time in which the earliest of the Crusades were being waged , earnest and not unsuccessful efforts were being made , also in the name of Jesus , to restrict war . The Peace of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was supported by Church synods . It had for its object the exemption of non-combatants , especially clergy and peasants , from the devastation of the wars which were so chronic in medieval Europe . Slightly later came the Truce of God , also advocated by synods and councils of the Church , which attempted to suspend hostilities on certain days and at specified seasons ? usually from every Thursday to Sunday inclusive in memory of the sufferings of Jesus , from Advent to eight days after the Epiphany , and from Septuagesima to eight days after Easter ? all of them related to the life of Jesus . In England the Church through the penitentials proscribed feuds , and generally throughout Europe it attempted to prevent tournaments because of the passions which these contests aroused . Chivalry , too , arose from efforts to modify the profession of arms by Christian principles . Some of the knightly virtues ? humility , the denunciation of pride and boasting , voluntary poverty , love for one 's neighbour , and the protection of the weak ? seem to have  | come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought earnestly to reconcile enemies . The contradictions in the apparent effect of Jesus upon the warlike tradition of western Europe seem clearly to be due to the conflict between the environment and Jesus . As time has passed , Jesus has made himself more felt and has made decisive even though slow advance against the environment . The pre-Christian customs and ethics of western Europe , including those of both the Romans and the barbarians , glorified war and the profession of the soldier . The warrior was the head of society . From the warriors came the aristocracy . Religion was a communal affair and was supposed to prove its utility by giving victory to the arms of the tribe . When Christianity was adopted , particularly since the conversion was by mass methods and without much instruction in the nature of the new faith , it was expected to do what had been asked of the old , only more successfully . To be sure , all true Christians were supposed to be embraced in a new unity , Christendom , but Christendom took on something of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " chosen people , " the " true Israel of God , " who enjoyed the peculiar favour of God . War within Christendom was deplored , as in the old days intra-tribal war was regarded as a misfortune . Christian ethics , including Christian love , applied peculiarly among Christians . War against the infidel , however , was not only allowable but in some circumstances a duty . Upon war was invoked the blessing of the Christian God as the tutelary deity of Christendom . The non-Christian , and particularly the Moslem , was an enemy of Christendom and of the Christian God . Especially was it the duty of Christians to wrest from the infidel the holy places of the Christian faith . However , religion was not the only impelling force behind  | the Crusades . In one sense these undertakings were a prolongation of that southward migration of northern European peoples which in the fifth century had dealt such destructive blows to the Roman Empire . They had their continuation in the discoveries and settlements made by Europeans in the fifteenth , sixteenth , seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe in the nineteenth century . Into many phases of this general movement religion entered , sometimes very potently . Seldom , however , was it the only motive . Frequently it was not the major one . As in so many other phases of our story , the influence which emanated from Jesus was mixed with other factors . Not all medieval Christians endorsed the Crusades . It is significant that as time passed some came to entertain serious doubts about them , and that these doubts were in those movements that sought afresh to incorporate the spirit of Jesus . Thus Thomas Aquinas , that great mind who was early caught up into the Dominican order , declared that war could be waged against the infidel only to prevent him from hindering the faith or from persecuting Christians , and that he could not be forced to believe . Another master-mind , Roger Bacon , who was one of the original Franciscan group at Oxford , held that the Crusades were a cruel and useless waste , and that the infidels should not be attacked but should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is important to note that some of the radical sects of the Middle Ages who in their zeal to follow Jesus fully broke with the official Church were opposed to all war and were thoroughgoing pacifists . Also highly significant is the contrast between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the use  | of the cross in war . In the Middle Ages it was employed to incite Catholic Christians to fight against non-Christians and heretics . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it became the symbol of a non-combatant organization which sought to relieve the distress and suffering caused by war , and without discrimination between Christians and non-Christians or between the sides which the sick and the wounded had espoused . Apparently as the descendants of the mass converts became more familiar with Jesus , the meaning of the teachings , the life , and the death of Jesus began better to be understood , and what Paul had called " the mind of Christ " began to have freer course and to have a wider and more profound effect . Jesus first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians to be unrighteous , and then to challenge the Crusades and the use of aggressive force against nonChristians . Later he impelled Christians to develop a law of nations as among themselves , and still later to extend that law to non-Christians . Then he led to a movement to alleviate some of the horrors of war . To some , he has brought an impelling incentive to rid all mankind of war . Here , as in so many other phases of human life , as the centuries have passed the influence of Jesus has progressively become more widespread and snore potent . Upon marriage and the life of the family Jesus had an effect . Following what it believed to be his commands , the Church stood for monogamy and against polygamy and concubinage , and made divorce difficult . The honours paid to the Virgin probably helped to give dignity to womanhood . Perhaps , too , the celebration of the Nativity and the Christmas carols which arose out of it tended to give sanctity  | to conception and child-bearing and to inculcate respect for childhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus take effect among any considerable proportion of the population . The roughness of the age and , in the earlier centuries , the transition from the native culture of the barbarians to that of the conquered lands often led to the abandonment of the moral ' and social controls of the one without the effective adoption of those of the other . Licence was wide-spread . Coarseness and crassness of speech abounded . The mighty had their mistresses . Illegitimacy was frequent . What in effect was polygamy or concubinage was widely tolerated . Now and again , in a spasm of religious revival , ecclesiastical authorities attempted to enforce the rule of chastity among the monks and nuns and to extend celibacy to all the clergy . Notable in this endeavour was the Cluny movement . Yet among the clergy concubinage was often so common as not to provoke comment , and even by monks and nuns the violation of the vow of chastity was frequent . However , among both laity and clergy were many who in family life and in relations between the sexes so closely approximated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption about them . In popular festivals the impulse from Jesus worked a decided change . The Christian Sunday , or Lord 's Day ( in honour of Jesus ) , was generally observed . Sometimes it was supported by law . Leading events in the career of Jesus ? his nativity , the Epiphany ( connected with the visit to him of the wise men of the East ) , his death , and his resurrection ? were major feast or fast days . To be sure , these were sometimes celebrated by carousal and drunkenness , and to several of them clung customs of pagan origin , but something of their significance penetrated to the majority . On the devout mi-  | nority their inner meaning made a profound impression . " The Christian Year " which stressed the days connected with Jesus helped to mould the customs and the mind of Europe . As one example , consider the Christmas festival . It was associated with the Winter Solstice , and to it were long attached practices and attitudes which came down from the pagan celebrations of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the birth of Jesus and the incarnation of the Son of God for man 's redemption . Jesus made powerfully for the amelioration of the lot of the underprivileged , the unfortunate , and the sick . Slavery continued in the Middle Ages , but at least once a council of the Western Church declared that no Christian should be enslaved . Manumission was frequent , particularly as a dying act which would contribute to the salvation of the master 's soul . One of the motives assigned in the formal documents of emancipation was the example of Jesus . Serfs , too , were sometimes freed and on several occasions the announced motives were those derived front Christianity . Loving service to the poor and the sick was enjoined by Jesus . Front their earliest ( lays Christians had made provision for the iufirnn and the indigent among their own number . When , the Ill tit and sixth centuries , practically all the population of the basin of the Mediterranean became Christian and when at . the same time government and orderly society in much of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took over the functions of poor relief and ministry to the sick which previously had been shared with the state and with private , non-religious agencies . Sometimes bishops were great almoners . Normally monasteries gave hospitality to strangers and travellers . Numbers of them also cared for the poor and the sick in their  | neighbourhood . Many cathedrals and parish churches had hospitals attached to them . Christian brotherhoods arose for the purpose of serving in hospitals . Many a monastery had a special house for lepers , and in the thirteenth century the Crucigeri , whose name is evidence of their inspiration from Jesus , had charge of many asylums for lepers . The Church officially protected the shipwrecked and decreed excommunication for those who plundered these unfortunates . Religious orders were founded for the purpose of ransoming Christians who had been carried into slavery by Moslems . As time passed and civil society once more took on more elaborate forms , some of the philanthropic activities of specifically religious bodies were assumed by non-religious agencies . Notably cities , as they came into being and rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet much of this was from a Christian motive . Even down into our own period and in highly organized and wealthy states , institutions which are avowedly Christian still share the care of the sick , the orphans , the aged , and the poor . Again and again , moreover , as in the dark ages after the fall of the Roman Empire in the West , Christians , acting in the name of their Master , have come forward to fill the gap left by the absence of other agencies , and have formed associations and founded institutions to meet palpable human needs . Not only were efforts made by Christians to alleviate the lot of those who were buffeted by existing society . Repeatedly also protests which claimed precedent in Jesus were registered against a structure of society which embodied poverty , oppression , and injustice , programmes were outlined for a better A number of the revolts of peasants which punctuated the later Middle  | Ages had leaders who declared that in demanding an economic and social order which gave more justice to the underprivileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at least some of these rebellions lay the wide-spread popular preaching by the Franciscans and Dominicans , the carrying of the Christian message to the masses . Other movements were chiefly in the towns and cities . Thus Arnold of Brescia , who denounced the possession of property by the Church , the clergy , and monks as contrary to the precepts of Jesus and the example of the Apostles and demanded a different relation of the Church to society , drew his followers mainly from the cities of Italy . The Beghards or Beguins of the Low Countries , who tried to establish among themselves community of property and apostolic poverty , were largely in the industrial and commercial cities of that region . It seems significant that most of these revolts and of these schemes for an ideal society appeared in the later centuries of the medieval period . This was in part because of the breakup of the old manorial and feudal system and the emergence of a new urban and capitalistic economy . However , to the ferment the impulse which came from Jesus contributed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a thesis it would probably be impossible either to prove or to disprove . Yet that Jesus had a share in what happened is indubitable . Men could not forget that he stood for the dignity of human life and kindness to one 's neighbour , and that he held that the highest qualities of the spirit were endangered by a preoccupation with material possessions . As a knowledge of his teachings spread , it was but natural that he should contribute to popular movements against the exploitation of the poor by the rich and against the wealth and the  | pomp of the leaders of the Church which professed to represent him . It was not merely rebels and persecuted minorities who dreamed of a Christian society . There were also in high official position those who were inspired by the vision and who sought to make it come true . Charlemagne was fond of Augustine 's City of God and must have believed that in his labours in building and governing his empire he was helping to construct a Christian order . Some of the great Popes strove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian principles and to bring it into conformity with Christian standards . The thousand years between the fifth and the sixteenth century of the influence of Jesus , then , witnessed a marked increase in the effect of Jesus upon mankind . Not long after it had yielded nominal allegiance to him , Greco-Roman society collapsed in wide areas . Yet the impulse which came from Jesus , far from waning with the decline of the world with which it had seemingly been closely identified , continued to grow . It made itself felt over a far wider territory than before . Upon its greatest contemporary religious rival , Islam , it left an impression . Into a new culture which emerged , that of western Europe , it entered more potently than it had ever been able to do into the culture of the Graco-Roman world . Western Europe of the Middle Ages was far from embodying fully the teachings of Jesus . In many ways the tension between the life of medieval Europe and Jesus was more severe than in the Roman Empire . However , the baldness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jesus was making himself more fully felt . Probably more  | men were conscious of the disparity between the profession and the practice of a nominally Christian society than in the fourth and fifth centuries . Moreover , as the centuries passed , the effect of Jesus upon western Europe increased . If life did not fully conform to Jesus , at least Jesus had left his mark more deeply upon more phases of it than he had done in earlier times .  | IN THE fifteenth century of its existence the influence of Jesus again appeared to be threatened . As in the fifth century , Christianity seemed to be in a parlous state . Now as then the cultures with which Christianity had come to be most closely associated were breaking up . In the East , the Byzantine Empire and with it much of Byzantine culture were wiped out by the Moslem Turk . In the West , the political , intellectual , and social fabric of the Middle Ages , into whose warp and woof Christianity had entered , was passing and in place of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the Church under their control to an extent unequalled in the western Europe of the Middle Ages and threatened to stifle the free expression of the Christian conscience . The Renaissance and humanism were ushering men into a new intellectual world and the dawn of the scientific method was beginning that obsession of man with the physical universe and that confidence in his ability to understand it and make it serve his ends which was in marked contrast with the acceptance of past authority and of revelation and with the concentration of attention upon God and theology which characterized the intellectual life of the Middle Ages . Feudalism and the manorial system were disappearing and the landed aristocracy was being challenged by the bourgeoisie and by monarchs with enhanced powers . The Church had been integrated with feudalism and the  | decay of the latter tb:atened the former 's power . Again , as in the fifth and sixth centuries , Christianity was menaced by its very successes . The disappearance of the culture which it had done so much to build undermined its position . In some respects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sombre than at the close of the fifth century . Then the invaders were pagans or nominal Christians . The polytheism of the former offered no very stubborn resistance to a higher religion such as Christianity ? particularly when , as in this case , that religion was closely associated with a " higher " culture : In the fifteenth century the invaders of Christendom were the Ottoman Turks , Moslems , the adherents of a faith which was younger than Christianity and which had supplanted the latter in the affections of many millions . In A.D. 1500 the Empire of the Ottoman Turks was more powerful than was any one of the Christian kingdoms of western Europe . Moreover , Christendom was so divided that for the most part the frantic appeals of the Popes for united action against the Turks fell on unheeding ears . In the year 500 no serious internal malady had afflicted the Church . To be sure , the division between Arians and orthodox had been acute , but Arianism was a waning power , especially after the conversion of Clovis to Catholicism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nestorians , and Donatists ? but the large majority of Christians were in the Catholic fold , and in parts of the West the Catholic Church had a structure stronger than that of the Empire . The monastic movement was in the full flush of its lusty youth and was soon to become the mother of most of the missionaries who were to win the pagan barbarians to the faith . In A.D. 1500 , however , the Church was badly off . In Mesopotamia and central Asia its chief representatives , the Nestori-  | ans , had been reduced to a mere shadow of their former strength . The Greek Orthodox Church was dwindling and its head was now a subject of the Moslem . In western Europe the Church had only recently recovered from an unseemly schism over the succession to the See of Peter . Its Popes were worldly politicians who appeared more intent on maintaining their secular power in Italy than on furthering the spirit of Jesus . The corruption of the Papal court was a stench in the nostrils of all honest men . Throughout western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their nepotism , their ignorance , and their moral laxity . Monasticism , once a centre of life , now seemed in hopeless decay . Could a religion threatened by so many changes in its environment and such aggressive foreign foes , and officially represented by so decrepit an institution hope to survive ? Certainly to the superficial observer the chances must have seemed slight that the influence of Jesus would continue to grow . In spite of this unpromising beginning , in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries came a renewal of life in the Christianity of western Europe which in variety , extent , and power surpassed any awakening that the faith had yet known . In the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries Christianity spread over a wider area than any religion had ever done . Never before had Jesus ? or any member of the human race ? influenced so many men . In many respects , moreover , that influence not only broadened but deepened . While even the most prominent of them still fell far short of the ideal set up by Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called themselves Christians approached the standards of Jesus . Upon cultures and group action the effect of Jesus was wider and deeper ? although not necessarily more varied ? than at any previous time .  | In the eighteenth century the impulse from Jesus again seemed to wane , but in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it showed abounding vitality . Moreover , the threat to the influence of Jesus in the fifteenth century , while greater than that in the fifth century , did not bring Christianity to so low an ebb . By the end of the ninth century the culmination of attacks of external and internal foes had ' reduced Christianity to a sorrier state than it has since known . Revival , too , came more quickly after the fifteenth century than it had after the fifth . The new burst of energy displayed by the impulse from Jesus in the sixteenth century , while spectacular and almost abrupt , was not so sudden as might at first appear . Back of it was a long preparation . To many observers the Christianity of the fifteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many signs of life could be discerned . Numbers of those on the advance front of thought ? humanists most of them ? especially north of the Alps , were deeply religious and longed for an improvement in the current Christianity . ' I-hey were particularly impressed with the precepts of Jesus , desired a quality of living which more nearly approximated to them , and were impatient with the crass veneration of relics , the pilgrimages , and the venality and ignorance of the clergy which were part of the popular religion of the time . Morally , organized Christianity had probably not departed as far from Jesus as it had repeatedly done in the preceding thousand years . The discontent and criticism meant that men were more widely conscious of the disparity between it and the ideals of Jesus than they had previously been . In other words , Jesus was having an increasing effect upon the consciences of the rank and file of men . In a number of regions translations of the Bible were being made into  | the vernacular , the newly invented printing was aiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first hand with the teachings of the Bible and especially of Jesus . Much of simple piety based upon the main outlines of the Gospel story existed among peasants and townspeople . Such manuals of devotion and of Christian living as the The German Theology and the Imitation of Christ were the product of fourteenth and fifteenth century Christianity . Many lay movements , some of them frowned upon by the official Church as heretical , gave evidence of a growing study of Jesus and of considered devotion to him . The Brethren of the Common Life arose from the way of the Christian mystic and conducted some of the best schools of the fifteenth century . The faith adopted centuries before as a community affair was more and more being studied , understood , and consciously appropriated by individuals . Formerly monasticism had been deemed the one outlet for the expression of a complete surrender to God . Now not only the way of the monk but also other paths were being trod by those who wished completely to do the will of God as seen in Jesus . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the religious life of western Europe . The swelling undercurrent of life broke out spectacularly , as we have suggested , into fresh tides which largely revolutionized the Christianity of western Europe and made it more widely effective than ever before . Some of these tides found expression in the Protestant Reformation . The Protestant Reformation was not one movement . Luther was not its only originator or its only leader . To be sure , he shaped the future course of religion in Scandinavia and much of Germany and left an impression on many another area . Yet some of the currents which issued in Prot-  | estantism antedated Luther or were largely independent of him . Humanism made its contribution , especially through Erasmus and Zwingli . The Anabaptists go back in part to medieval sects . The various strains intermingled . The several movements for reform stimulated one another . All , however , had in common a desire to return to Jesus and his Apostles as portrayed in the New Testament and to free current Christianity from accretions which they deemed contrary to the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Testament . Others would keep much which had been developed by the Church since New Testament times but which was not in obvious contradiction to the New Testament . Protestantism was multiform . It has continued to be so . Sometimes that has been a weakness . Usually , however , here has been an indication of vigour . New major divisions in Protestantism ( as distinguished from the many minor ones due to envy , anger , or personal ambition ) have generally come about through a fresh religious experience or conviction which , embodied iii some leader or leaders , has attracted adherents . As a rule , the emergence of new denominations has been a sign of vitality . Most of the outstanding varieties of Protestantism can be traced to fresh and creative contact with the impulses set in motion by Jesus . Luther found the sense of forgiveness and peace for which he had long agonized , when he was able to trust in simple faith to the mercy and grace of God as seen in Jesus . It was a little group of Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief desire was intimacy with Christ who prepared the way for the Reformation in France . Prominent in Calvin 's Institutes were God the Son and the redemption wrought through him . The  | new birth made possible by the love of God in Jesus and mediated through the Spirit was stressed by the Anabaptists and later by the Pietists and the Evangelicals . Jesus , it need scarcely be said , was not the only element in the emergence of the Protestant Reformation and of the various bodies in the Protestant tradition . Other factors entered , some of them quite opposed to much for which Jesus stood . German nationalistic resentment against exploitation by Italian ecclesiastics and the desire of German princes to control the Church in their own domains were potent in the Protestant movement in Germany . In Scandinavia the determination of the monarchs to dominate the Church was influential in the adoption of Lutheranism . Henry the Eighth 's insistence upon the annulment of the marriage with Catherine and the unwillingness of the Pope to antagonize Catherine 's nephew , the powerful Charles the Fifth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rome . The eventual form of the Church of England owed much to the desire of the astute and worldly Elizabeth to have back of her a unified church as a support to a united nation . Struggles of classes and factions entered into the Reformation in Scotland . The Protestant Reformation was by no means a purely religious movement . In some of its manifestations the religious factor seemed minor and simply the cloak for motives and ambitions which Jesus would have condemned . Yet without Jesus the Protestant Reformation would not have occurred and on it he left an indelible stamp . The ferment was not confined to Protestantism . Some of it was retained within the Roman Catholic Church . The old wine-skins proved sufficiently flexible to make room for at least some of the new wine . Many earnest souls believed that the Roman Catholic Church was the true Church of Christ  | and that what was needed was reform and not revolution . They would preserve the ecclesiastical structure , the sacraments , and the theology of the Church of the Middle Ages , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its clergy from Christian ethics and would improve the quality of the life of the laity . Earnest new groups arose which remained within the Church and from which came much of the leadership for the reform ? such as the Oratory of Divine Love , the Theatines , and the Capuchins . The most powerful of these new groups , and the most potent in assisting and spreading the reform and in winning back territory from the Protestants , took the name of Jesus ? the Society of Jesus . The Spiritual Exercises which constituted the backbone of its distinctive discipline centred about Jesus . They held up the life of Jesus for imitation and dwelt upon the passion and the resurrection . The Catholic Reformation purged the clergy of much of the simony , the nepotism , the luxury , and the licentiousness which had been a chronic scandal during the Middle Ages . It improved the education of the parish clergy . It brought back some of the old monastic houses and orders to their first worthy ideals . It prepared catechisms for the better instruction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the level of the education and morals of the clergy been so high . Never since the mass conversions which began with Constantine had so many of the laity been given such thorough and systematic instruction in their faith . The religious awakenings of these years were not confined to western Christendom . They appeared also in Russia . Between the most prominent of the new movements in Russia and the revivals in western Europe no causal connexion existed . Here and there Russian Christians felt the repercus-  | sions of what was happening in the West , but in general the Russian awakenings were quite indigenous . In them Russian Christianity was coming of age . No longer was there mere passive acquiescence in what was imposed from above by secular and ecclesiastical superiors . Many were thinking for themselves on the meaning of what had come to them . In some this assumed the guise of rigid adherence to earlier forms of ritual in opposition to innovations ? which were also meant to be reforms ? imposed from above . In others it took the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all its phases Russian Christianity tended to be more quietistic and less activistic than that of the West . Its adherents were far less aggressive in endeavouring to bring human institutions into conformity with the principles of Jesus . Concurrently with revival went territorial extension . Part of this was the result of the revival . All of it was accompanied by a remarkable expansion of European peoples . The well-known story of this expansion of Europe we must give only in the barest outline . Directed by Prince Henry the Navigator , the Portuguese began pushing their way along the west coast of Africa . Almost at the close of the fifteenth century they succeeded in reaching India by way of the Cape of Good Hope . They soon built for themselves a commercial empire in India , the East Indies , and the Far East , and acquired widely scattered territorial possessions . Under Spanish auspices Columbus sailed westward and discovered a new world . In the West Indies and the Americas Spain acquired a vast colonial empire . Spain even extended her rule across the Pacific to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ample but less broad domain . Later came the English and the Dutch and built up commerce and acquired  | territories in North America , the West Indies , India , and , in the case of the Dutch , in Ceylon and the East Indies . The French staked out territory in North America and obtained footholds in India and Indo-China . The Danes also were represented in India and the West Indies , but on a much smaller scale than any of the others . The Russians began a march eastward which carried their frontiers across northern Asia and into Alaska . To just what extent this expansion of European peoples can be ascribed to the impulse which came from Jesus no man ought to attempt to say . Into that expansion , as into so many movements associated with Jesus , entered many factors , some of them destructive of all for which Jesus stood . The lure of the wealth of the Indies helped to urge the Portuguese southward around Africa to India and to send Columbus westward across the Atlantic . Thousands of Spaniards went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For most of the British and Dutch enterprises the primary motive was commercial gain . In a majority of the undertakings of all the European peoples a thirst for adventure was prominent . But why should Europeans rather than other peoples display a restless energy which has carried them over the face of the entire globe , across trackless seas , through steaming tropical jungles , over parching deserts , up mountains never before scaled by man , and eventually to the North and South Poles ? Is it something inherent in race ? Is it the climate in which they are cradled ? Or is it in part the confidence and the emancipation of the human spirit which are from the legacy of Jesus and the fact that in Europe , and especially in western Europe , the impulse from Jesus has had freer course and has been less hampered than in any other area ? At present no one knows . However , although we can not exactly measure it , Jesus had  | a part and an important part in bringing about this expansion . Of that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have occurred we may not know . That , actually , it was to some extent due to him is clear . Henry the Navigator had as one of his motives the salvation of souls through the Christian Gospel . Columbus cherished a desire to spread the Catholic faith in the newly discovered lands . The Philippine Islands were occupied even more as a missionary than as a commercial outpost . Spaniards dreamed through them of effecting spiritual conquests in the Far East . In some of the English settlements in North America , notably in New England and in Pennsylvania , the purpose of erecting a commonwealth according to the principles of Jesus was prominent . Fully as important was the manner in which the impulse from Jesus helped to determine the quality of the expansion of Europe and modified the impact of European upon non-European peoples . Here was a migration of peoples , the greatest which the human race had ever seen , and partly the product of the impulse from Jesus . Given the evil in human nature , inevitably it brought with it much cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the conquerors . Would the impulse from Jesus be strong enough to overcome the ills in a movement which it had shared in calling into existence ? Could it make of this migration not a curse but a blessing to mankind ? On the answer to these questions depends in part our judgment of the significance of Jesus and of the nature of the universe . In all the colonies established by migrating European peoples the influence of Jesus was present . In some it was weaker than in the mother-country . In others it was stronger . Thus the communities founded by the Spaniards in the Americas were professedly Christian , but the Christianity of the new  | plantations did not possess the vigour of that of Spain . A continuous influx of blood from the Old World was required to preserve it from decay . Throughout the more than three centuries of the colonial period missionaries continued to come from Europe , not only to the Indians but also to those of white stock . The great majority of the bishops were not American but Spanish born and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life paralleled the secular government . The colonies were closely controlled by the mother-country and the chief posts in the state were filled by appointees from Spain . The Church was kept subservient to the Crown and was accorded little opportunity for freedom of action . Yet , although it may have been in part because of this Cxsaropapism , the fact remains that in Latin America the impulse issuing from Jesus , except where reinforced by new recruits from Europe , while persisting , has never shown quite the vitality that it has in the mother-countries . On the other hand , the Christianity of the English settlements in North America displayed remarkable vigour . From it sprang new movements , notably the Great Awakening of the eighteenth century and the modification of Calvinism by Edwards and his successors . Out of it arose missions to non-Christians ? before A.D. 1 Boo to the Indians and negroes and after A.D. 1800 to nearly every portion of the globe . As we are to see in a later chapter , this Christianity of the United States has exerted a profound influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of the Americas , in Asia , Africa , and the islands of the Pacific , but also has flowed back into Europe and has helped to shape the life of that continent . Commerce and the migrations of peoples are frequent features of human history ? although no others have been so extensive as those of Europeans . Usually they have been ac-  | companied by the selfish exploitation of passive by aggressive peoples . To this the expansion of Europeans has been no exception . Here , however , in what came from Jesus has been a force which has fought the exploitation of the weak by the strong , and has striven to make the coming of the European beneficent and not demoralizing . It has modified , and to the immeasurable good of the human race , this greatest of movements of peoples which the world has yet seen . Accompanying this explosive spread of Europeans was a remarkable Christian missionary movement . While it was associated with the economic and political enterprises of Europeans , it was more or less distinct from them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonism again and again developed . At times Christian missionaries were made the tools of political and economic imperialism . Repeatedly , however , they were critical of it and often were in opposition to it . In this missionary movement the impulse from Jesus displayed remarkable vitality . As always , too , it created a tension between itself and various degrading expressions of human activity . The geographic extent of the missionary movement is amazing . Missionaries were found wherever Europe ? n explorers , merchants , and settlers went . Often missionaries became pathfinders for the others . Sometimes they penetrated regions where the others did not follow . As we have suggested , they ministered spiritually to their fellow-Europeans and attempted to hold them to the faith and to bring their actions towards the level of the standards of Jesus . They brought the Christian message to non-Christians and built up Christian communities among pagan peoples . In vast areas they won whole tribes and nations to a formal acceptance of the Christian faith .  | In the portions of the Americas subdued by the Spaniards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spanish Crown considered it a duty to see that a religious establishment was provided for the colonists and that the Indians were brought to adopt the Christian faith . In the areas where fairly high cultures of settled peoples existed , chiefly in Mexico and Peru , the native populations quickly accepted the faith of their new masters . Baptism was not forced , in the sense that Charlemagne had imposed it on the Saxons seven centuries before . In this respect the Christian conscience was making progress . Conversion was generally accomplished through zealous missionaries . However , in the main the missionaries were financed by the state , and it is not strange that a relatively docile people , used to domination by a ruling class , acquiesced when the Spaniards displaced the old aristocracy , and that they submitted to baptism at the hands of the clergy who accompanied the conquistadores . In regions where civilization had not been so high or the population so numerous , Christian missionaries were often the agents for the extension of Spanish rule and of Spanish culture . They induced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of agriculture , trained them in simple industries , taught some of them reading and writing and even the Spanish language , and instructed them in the main tenets and practices of the Roman Catholic faith . Theirs was a paternalistic regime . When the missionaries were withdrawn , as some of them were by the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Spanish possessions in 1767 , and when at the close of the eighteenth and the fore part of the nineteenth century the surviving missionary staffs were dealt serious blows by the Napoleonic wars and the independence of the  | colonies , many of these communities scattered and in some instances their members relapsed into paganism . Everywhere in the Church in Spanish America as in the state the white man remained dominant . The Christianity of the Indians was largely passive . It displayed much less aggressive vitality than did that even of the white colonists . Much of it seemed like a thinly veiled paganism . A large proportion of the secular clergy who succeeded the missionaries were avaricious , superstitious , and sensual . Yet this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its popular expressions , Jesus on his cross and the Mother of Jesus were central . Occasionally it gave birth to noble souls who had obviously through it caught some of the meaning of Jesus . In Portuguese America the progress of Christianity was a variant of that in Spanish America . Missions were not quite so potent as in the Spanish domains and the jungles of the Amazon Valley offered effective obstacles to the permeation of Portuguese rule and culture , but a nominal Christianity was professed by the whites and mestizos and in some regions the Indians were won . In French America heroic efforts were made by earnest missionaries to convert the Indians , but most of the latter did not lead settled lives , and only slowly did they adapt themselves to the white man 's culture and accept his faith . In English America the nature of the settlements and of the methods by which the colonist made his living were such that the Indian was pushed back by the advancing frontier . In the main Spanish possessions he was forced to perform the rough manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantations and in the mines he was the one who produced the wealth which supported the white elements of the population . In contrast , in the English colonies mines  | were few and the labour on the farms was performed either by the white man himself or by negroes from Africa . With rare exceptions the Indian would not work for the white and was a rival to be driven back or exterminated rather than assimilated . Then , too , the Indian population was much more sparse than in such leading Spanish colonies as Mexico and Peru . Yet even in the English colonies missions for the Indians were numerous and often successful . Many Indians became Christians and through the missionary and their own efforts made their adjustment to the new order brought by the European . In all parts of the Americas , the impulse which came from Jesus tended to soften the impact of the conquering and colonizing whites upon the Indians . In many places , particularly in its earlier stages , the advent of the European brought to the Indian intense suffering . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the whites as the one way by which the latter could exploit the mines and the soil and acquire the wealth whose lure had drawn them to the New World . In the West Indies the cruelties were so great that the Indians were all but exterminated . In some other areas their numbers were badly depleted . In most places on the mainland the Indian survived , but in a state of peonage to the whites . Iu English America , as we have said , the Indian was an obstacle to the white man 's efforts to make a living and either succumbed to the white man 's diseases and firearms or was driven back . In the major part of French America before ' Soo the white population was too sparse to have much effect on the Indian . Yet the Indian would have fared far worse had it not been for conscious efforts by white men to bring to bear on relations with him the principles of Jesus .  | The earliest famous champion of the Indians in the Spanish possessions was Bartolome de Las Casas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he himself was the first priest to be ordained in the colonies . It was fitting and significant that in this first generation of conquistadores and in this first Christian priest ordained in the New World there should arise the great defender of the Indians . The impulse from Jesus was early at work on behalf of the aborigines . In repeated visits to Spain and by word and pen Las Casas brought to the attention of the heads of Church and state and to the reading Christian public the atrocities perpetrated on the Indians by his fellow-countrymen . In America he endeavoured to found a colony which would prove that the forced labour of the Indians was not essential to the economic prosperity of the settlers . This attempt failed , but Las Casas later served as a bishop in one of the most difficult dioceses in America and essayed there to carry out some of the ideals which he had advocated and to enforce the laws in favour of the Indians for whose enactment he had been partially responsible . Las Casas was only one of many Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Indian . In Paraguay a governor who had learned much through years of suffering aroused the implacable enmity of some of the whites by his measures in behalf of the natives . In Paraguay , too , the Jesuits long conducted a mission which had as part of its programme the protection of their charges from slave raiders and from contamination with the vices of the white man . The Papal See forbade the enslavement of the Indians and issued other decrees to ensure them decent treatment and Christian instruction . The monarchs of Spain professed , some of them sincerely , as Christians to feel them-  | selves trustees for the spiritual and physical welfare of their dusky subjects . With the aid and under the stimulus of their advisers they enacted in the Laws of the Indies rules for the humane government of the Indians . Never before had such care been taken by monarchs over so wide an area to make their conquests a means of improving the lot of those whom they had subdued . The dreams of the reformers were by no means completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain were only partly enforced . The greed of colonists and officials and the impossibility of developing the material wealth of the New World without the labour of the Indian to some extent nullified the efforts of those who wished the coming of the white man to be a blessing to the aborigines . Yet those who in this difficult situation endeavoured to translate into concrete action the precepts of Jesus did not entirely fail . Because of them the lot of thousands of Indians was much easier than it would otherwise have been . Spanish colonial administration in practice was a compound of two irreconcilable and contradictory forces ? the avarice which seems part of human nature and the desire for the welfare of even the most humble and backward of men which has its source in Jesus . In the F ; nglish colonies were many attempts to deal with the Indians in the spirit of Jesus . Roger Williams , with his insistence that land be purchased from the Indians rather than taken from them by force ; John Eliot , and his famous mission to the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his efforts to prepare them for life in contact with the culture of the white man ; the paternalistic mission of several generations of Mayhews on Martha 's Vineyard ; the policy of peaceful fair dealing which the Friends adopted  | in their Pennsylvania settlements ; the missions of the Moravians ? these and many other instances are evidence that in the impulse from Jesus was that which for Protestants as well as Roman Catholics issued again and again in efforts to soften the impact of race upon race and of culture upon culture , to make that impact beneficent and not brutalizing , and to protect the weaker peoples from ruthless and destructive exploitation . It is important to notice , moreover , that in opposing the selfish exploitation of the weaker by the stronger races the impulse from Jesus was much more effective in the three hundred years after 1500 than it had been in the previous thousand years . The treatment of the Indians by the Spaniards and the English bore much more evidence of the presence of the Christian spirit than had the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wends , or of the Germans and Scandinavians towards the nonTeutonic peoples of the Baltic . In Africa in these three centuries the record is not nearly so good . On that continent Europeans made few and feeble settlements before i 800 . Some missions there were , but most of them proved ephemeral . From Africa , moreover , Europeans took thousands of negro slaves to work the white man 's plantations in the New World . The African slave trade is one of the darkest blots on the history of mankind . It accentuated the ferocity and the frequency of intertribal wars in Africa , for by these and by raids of negroes on negroes the black cargoes of the slavers were obtained . It was accompanied by the incalculable sufferings of the voyage from Africa to the Americas . It made possible the inhumanities of negro slavery on the plantations of the West Indies , of Central and South America , and of the English colonies in  | North America . Never has there been so extensive an exploitation of one race by another . Moreover , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters of the plantations in the New World were from professedly Christian peoples and most of them as individuals had been baptized and probably would have called themselves Christians . They were from lands where for hundreds of years the impulse from Jesus had been making itself felt . Any appraisal of the effect of Jesus and of the bearing of the record of that effect upon the place of Jesus in the eternal scheme of things , upon the nature of the universe , and upon the existence of God and of His dealings with men must take into account the failure to prevent this prolonged agony . However , in the same breath it must also be said that such efforts as were put forth to alleviate the evil of the African slave trade and of negro slavery were made in the name of Jesus . It was Peter Claver , of the Society of Jesus , who for a generation did what one devoted , loving individual could to minister to the unhappy blacks at Cartagena , one of the ports at which the slavers landed their cargoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed them to their noisome places of confinement on the land , caring for the sick and baptizing the dying . Towards the close of the eighteenth century one of the kings of Spain ordered masters to see that their negro slaves were given Christian instruction , were allowed freedom from work to go to church services on Sundays and on other important days of the Church , that they be clothed , and that the ill among them be cared for . Towards the end of the eighteenth century , moreover , many in England whose consciences had been made sensitive by the religious awakenings of that period began to attack the institution of negro slavery . Some , as the  | only form of protest open to them , declined to use sugar , the product of slave labour . Others , more prominent , notably Wilberforce , spiritually a product of the Evangelical Awakening , and some of the Quakers , began an insistent attack on the African slave trade . Early in the nineteenth century they obtained the proscription of that traffic by act of Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still later in the nineteenth century the Christian conscience was chiefly responsible for the abolition of negro slavery itself , first in the British Empire and then in the United States . After emancipation many of the more earnest among the Christians were active in educating the freedman and helping him to take his place honourably and with selfrespect in the white man 's world . The impulse from Jesus was late in stirring men to effective action in behalf of the negro , but in the end it proved amazingly successful . Indeed , because of it , the African slave trade and slavery eventually led to a better lot for the negroes in the United States than if their ancestors . had remained in Africa . Because of Jesus a gigantic collective evil was transformed into a great collective good . Here is one of the most notable examples of a strange phenomenon which has occurred again and again . In lands where the impulse from Jesus has been most active certain chronic collective ills of mankind have assumed larger proportions than anywhere else ? but , stemming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in general , more successful efforts to meet them than elsewhere . The exploitation of the Indians of the New World and the efforts to curb it , negro slavery and the slave trade and the movements to abolish them , war and the endeavour to control it , to alleviate the evils caused by it , and eventually to eliminate it ,  | and industrialization and the ills arising from it and programmes for making industrialization contribute to the wellbeing of man , are all cases in point . In several instances the evils assumed their largest proportions in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries ? when the impulse from Jesus had been longest in the earth . It was then as well that the impulse from Jesus became most active and successful in combating them . In Asia and the islands of the Far East , with one or two notable exceptions , in the centuries between 1500 and ' Soo the impulse from Jesus did not make nearly so great an impression as in the Americas . However , missionaries transmitted it far more widely than they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a greater area , albeit superficially , than ever the influence of any one man had been carried in that great continent . In the Near East , under Moslem governments as it was , no attempts to win adherents to Christianity from Islam were possible . Roman Catholic missionaries were widely spread but confined their efforts chiefly to endeavouring to bring the non-Roman churches of that region into union with Rome . In India Christian missions were geographically very extensive . In luany sections of the east and west coasts and in a number of places in the interior missionaries resided for longer or shorter periods . In the missionary body Roman Catholics were iii the large majority . Conversions were chiefly in areas under Portuguese control or protection . Goa , the capital of Portuguese India , was the seat of the ranking Roman Catholic ecclesiastic . In the eighteenth century Protestant missionaries began to arrive . Some were opposed by the East India Company of the British , but gained a foot-  | hold under the protection of the Danes and the Dutch and succeeded in carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the Christian communities then founded continued to exist and constituted nuclei for a much greater growth in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . However , outside these communities , then comparatively small , the impulse proceeding from Jesus made practically no impression . In Ceylon the propagation of the Christian faith was closely associated with the political activities of the Portuguese . In sections allied with Portugal or under Portuguese control a large number of conversions were registered . Later , when the Dutch expelled the Portuguese , the new masters endeavoured to draw these Christians to the Dutch Reformed Church , but the large majority remained Roman Catholic either actually or in their affections . During the Napoleonic wars the British displaced the Dutch . Under the new regime the Dutch Church lost to the Roman Catholics most of its unwilling adherents . A few daring Roman Catholics penetrated to Tibet and even reached Lhasa , the centre of Tibetan Lamaistic Buddhism . However , they seem to have had no permanent results in the land . So , too , in Burma and Siam , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coasts and remained for longer or shorter periods had no noteworthy effect . In what in the nineteenth century became French IndoChina somewhat larger numerical results were obtained , again by the Roman Catholics . Through the initiative of missionaries the beginnings of that French interest were aroused which eventually led to the extension over the region of French political control .  | A few Christians were found in Malacca , successively the centre of Portuguese , Dutch , and British power on the Malay Peninsula . However , the Crescent had forestalled the Cross in establishing itself in the region and the conversions to Christianity were negligible . In the East Indies , in and near the trading posts which the Portuguese founded , Roman Catholic missionaries made a number of converts . Later , after the Dutch displaced the Portuguese , most of such small Christian communities as existed turned Protestant . Dutch missionary activity carried on under the direction and at the expense of the East India Company won additional groups . At the beginning of the nineteenth century , therefore , Protestant Christianity had obtained something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , as in most of the communities of converts gathered in this period in the Americas and Asia under the direction of the secular authorities , the Christianity was of the passive kind and did not spontaneously propagate itself . Missionary effort was almost entirely by Europeans . In the Philippines , Spanish effort brought into being the first Christian nation in the Far East . As we have said , the Philippines were occupied by way of America and chiefly as a missionary outpost . Secular authorities were in charge , but the mission ; ury element was very strong . Priests of a number of orders jealously competed in reaping " the harvest of souls . " At the coming of Spaniards most of the natives had the type of culture and religion which readily succumbs to those of more " advanced " peoples . Only in the South , where Islam had gained a foothold , and in the mountains where the terrain was difficult , did the missionaries meet effective resistance . Long before A.D. 1800 the majority of the population had accepted baptism . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , however , there was no large white ruling class to exploit the natives . The paternalism was , accordingly , benevolent . To be sure , the religious orders controlled vast estates and the majority of natives were in economic subjection to them , but the yoke of the friars was lighter than that of many of the lay proprietors of the Americas . Moreover , the missionaries ( lid much to improve the lot of the Filipinos . They reduced languages to writing , conducted schools , introduced better methods of agriculture , and inculcated the rudiments of Spanish culture . While the native tongues and much of tribal feeling persisted , in the common faith and culture brought by the missionaries and in the political control of Spain were ties which knit the Filipinos into the beginnings of a nation . Here , mixed though it was with other factors , the impulse from Jesus had marked results . China was the scene of prolonged , valiant , and able missionary effort . Except at the minute but important Portuguese leasehold at Macao , Europeans had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commerce of Europeans . In connexion with a Russian commercial-diplomatic mission , some ecclesiastics of the Russian Orthodox Church resided in Peking . However , before i 800 these made no converts . No European government was able to give effective support to efforts to propagate the Christian faith . Indeed , the attempts of the Portuguese government to control missions in China proved not an asset but an embarrassment and a source of contention among missionaries . More nearly than in any other major area in this period , Christianity came to China unsupported by European governments , commerce , or colonization . Moreover , in Chinese eyes Europeans were barbarians and no motive existed to accept  | Christianity as part of a superior culture . To be sure , Jesuit missionaries obtained a hearing by commending themselves through a knowledge of mathematics and astronomy which was superior to that of Chinese savants . Yet in China the appeal of the missionary was almost entirely religious . It was primarily as a religion that Christianity made its way . The numerical gains of Christianity in China between 1500 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time did the Christians number much over two hundred thousand . Yet in i 800 the Christian communities still contained about this number , and that in spite of nearly a century of intermittent but increasing persecution . Upon Chinese culture as a whole Christian missionaries probably had exerted very little influence . However , these two hundred thousand Roman Catholics , scattered in small groups over much of China , afforded footholds for nineteenth century missionaries and helped to make possible the phenomenal numerical growth of Roman Catholicism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . In Japan Christianity had a chequered and stormy career . It was introduced by the great Jesuit , Francis Xavier . At first it flourished iii connexion with Portuguese trade . The early niissional ies came under the xgis of Portugal and some of the local feudal lords believed that by encouraging missionaries they would gain an advantage in the competition for the lucrative Port uguese commerce . For a time Christianity grew apace . However , the Japanese rulers regarded it as a menace to the independence and unity of the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedge for European conquest . In the antagonism between the adherents of Christianity and those of other faiths they saw danger to the national solidarity which they were striving to create . Accordingly they proscribed Christianity , per-  | secuted Christians , and , to keep out Christian missionaries , shut the door to all European commerce except a very limited one with the Dutch . The closing of Japan against Europeans persisted for two centuries and was the chief lasting effect of the Christianity of this period upon that empire . A few Christians survived and loyally handed down their faith to their children , but they remained hidden in the hills and exerted no appreciable influence upon the life of the nation . On their eastern migrations across Siberia the Russians carried their faith with them . Some efforts were made in Asia and Alaska to win non-Christians to the Russian form of Christianity . However , the Russian population in Siberia and Alaska remained sparse and relatively few converts were made from among pagans . Missions were not a primary motive of the Russian adventure . Through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little effect upon mankind . From the preceding paragraphs it will be noted that it was mainly through Roman Catholicism that in the three centuries between 1500 and i 800 Jesus made himself felt outside of Europe . This was chiefly because during most of this period the major colonial powers , Spain and Portugal , were Roman Catholic . Yet , wherever Protestants were in touch with pagan peoples , there , sooner or later , Protestant missionaries came . Moravians , although small in numbers , dedicated themselves to propagating the Christian message throughout the world , and before A.D. i800 sent missionaries to as widely scattered regions as South Africa , British North America , Greenland , Labrador , the Danish West Indies , and Surinam . Significantly , Count Zinzendorf , the leader who most inspired them to do so and on whose estates their headquarters , I Terrnhut , was built , was especially devoted to Jesus . Moreover ,  | Russian Christianity , while not so aggressive , was displaying sufficient vitality to engage in the propagation of the faith . Every branch of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least some missionary initiative . In this expansion of Europe , as we have suggested , everywhere sharp antagonism existed between the impulse from Jesus and other impulses . The restless energy which sent Europeans across the world had contradictory motives and manifestations . Many merchants , colonists , and government officials were chronically and bitterly critical of the missionaries . Frequently they actively opposed them . On the one hand were Europeans who wished to take advantage of this expansion of Europe to better their own lot economically , if necessary at the expense of non-Europeans . On the other were those who strove to make of the expansion of Europe a channel for conveying the Christian Gospel and a means for the betterment of non-European peoples . Not always was the demarcation between the two groups sharply drawn . Among merchants , colonists , and civil officials were many who had conic under the spell of Jesus and laboured for the welfare of non-Europeans . That , indeed , was to be expected from the long presence in Europe of the impulse from Jesus . Here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling as a means to his own aggrandizement and for the prestige and the material gain of his own people . However , in general , the contradictory impulses went side by side . Fortunate it was for non-Europeans that the impulse from Jesus was present . At the risk of seeming to over-labour the question , we must return to the query which we asked at the outset of this brief description of the expansion of Europe : was this movement  | of Europeans more of a benefit than a curse to the human race ? If Jesus had an important share in evoking it , was he responsible for opening a Pandora 's box from which more demons emerged to plague mankind than could be exorcized by his spirit ? Perhaps it is even yet too early to pass confident judgment . The train of events set in motion by the expansion of Europe has not yet come to an end . It may , indeed , have only begun . On the one hand are the more extensive utilization of the resources of vast areas , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the physical comfort of man , and the coming of improved methods of education and of finer religious and moral ideals which have made for the spiritual enrichment and elevation of millions . On the other side are the barbarous exploitation by Europeans of non-Europeans with its unspeakable brutality and intense suffering , the crass materialism of much of the commerce and of many of the mines and plantations , and the wars of conquest and of rivalry between the imperialistic powers . To tabulate all these in their many ramifications , to strike a balance and to determine whether it is on the credit or the debit side , may be impossible . We must , however , say again that this much is certain . But for the impulse from Jesus the balance would undoubtedly be on the wrong side of the ledger . Most of whatever of good ? and it is much ? which has come to the world through the expansion of the peoples of western Europe is directly or indirectly traceable to Jesus . If he had a part in bringing it about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked to counteract its evils and to make it a blessing . The beneficent effects of Jesus through an expanding Europe were more marked after A.D. 1800 than before it . Between A.D. 1500 and A.D. 1800 they were more in evidence  | than before A.D. 1500 . Only slowly , apparently , does the impulse from Jesus overtake the forces of evil . That in the case of this greatest series of movements of peoples in the history of the race it has grown in extent and in effectiveness is , however , incontestable . We have devoted so much space to the expansion of Europe because , from the standpoint of the human race as a whole , it has had such momentous consequences . But what of the cultures of European peoples themselves ? In the three centuries between A.D. 1500 and A.D. ' Soo what effect did Jesus have upon them ? The civilization of northern Europe , as we have seen , grew up largely under the of the Church . On it , accordingly , the impulse from Jesus had exerted a marked influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or perhaps adolescence would be a better metaphor . More and more they were breaking away from the tutelage of the Church . Absolute monarchs , both Roman Catholic and Protestant , were extending the control of the secular state over the Church . Kings no longer were greatly awed by the maledictions of the Pope . Even so Catholic a monarch as Charles the Fifth might object to Luther but did not hesitate to treat the Pope in a cavalier fashion . his still more ardently Catholic son , Philip the Second of Spain , would brook no interference of the Pope in his realms . Moreover , by 1600 much of Europe was Protestant and its monarchs had spurned all allegiance to the Pope and insisted upon controlling the Church in their own domains . Education and learning , art , and even philanthropy were no longer so largely activities of the Church and under its control as they had been . Now that the Church was being constrained to abdicate in so many areas of human activity , could the impulse from Jesus continue to make itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the life of western and northern Europe ? An intelligent and dependable answer is not easily reached . As long as the Church was obviously so powerful in so many ranges of culture and organized life , it was fairly easy to see the influence of Jesus , for the Church professed to own him as its Lord , was theoretically his " body , " and certainly but for him would not have come into existence . Now that the Church was being ushered out from so much of direct authority over life , the influence of Jesus , when present , often entered in less obvious and more indirect ways . To an extent , perhaps to a very great extent , this was because Jesus was becoming less the exclusive possession of the clergy and was becoming more the common property of all . The difficulty of measuring his influence in part arises from the fact that more and more he was becoming part of the warp and woof of European life . Increasingly it is hard to disentangle the Christian thread and to distinguish it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs of action of individuals and groups and inquire for the sources of their motives , it is next to impossible to say just what elements in the intellectual and spiritual atmosphere which they breathed and from which they drew their life were due to Jesus . However , it is abundantly clear that in many individuals Jesus was continuing to be a force and that in at least some phases of life he was more potent than ever . It seems probable that upon European life as a whole Jesus exerted a greater influence than he had under the Roman Empire and even in the Middle Ages . Of the religious life of Europe we have already said something . We have noted that never before had areas touched by Christianity experienced a series of religious awakenings  | which were at once so diverse and which so profoundly affected so many different classes of people . In the early part of the Middle Ages the revivals tended to centre in the aristocracy and to take the conventional guise of a reformed monasticism recalled to its earlier ideals . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly through lay movements which the Church declared heretical , and partly through modified types of monasticism ? notably the Franciscans and Dominicans ? which remained within the Church . However , the heretics were nearly always small minorities . After A.D. 1500 the popular mass movements which broke the strait-jacket of the old official church with its stereotypes inherited from the Gneco-Roman world increased both in diversity and in numerical adherents . Whole cities , sections , and countries went over to them . Within the old church , moreover , revivals broke forth which resembled the conventional monasticism but which gave radically new expressions to the old tradition . These awakenings within Roman Catholicism brought more of those who remained within its colnmuniou towards an intelligent understanding and an earnest practice of the Christian faith as interpreted by that Church than at any time since the Church had been flooded by the mass converts of the third and fourth centuries . This pulsing new life was beginning to contribute to a growing rift between the Church and the world about it . Throughout most of the course of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have adhered to a particular religion not so much out of individual conviction or decision , as because they have been members of a given community . Some religions , such as Christianity and Buddhism , have begun as minority movements , but eventually have  | either become the faith of an entire community or have created fresh communities about them . Beginning with Constantine , Christianity was adopted as the community faith of the Graco-Roman world . Later it became the community faith of northern Europe and of the smaller communities within that larger one . Indeed , it was a determinative factor in creating the community of western Europe ? Latin " Christendom . " The Middle Ages , for this reason , seemed largely to be an " age of faith . " All except the Jews were baptized . To be sure , much scepticism existed , and many ridiculed or parodied even the most sacred of the Church 's beliefs and ceremonies . Yet all outwardly conformed except a growing minority who dissented because they felt impelled to do so by loyalty to what they believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of the Church of the majority . Even before A.D. 1500 a change began . Later , in the eighteenth century , it became particularly obvious . Christianity was still the community faith in western Europe . All except Jews were still baptized and the state often enforced conformity to the type of Christianity which prevailed within its borders . Yet on the one hand were those who began to challenge publicly some of the generally accepted tenets of Christianity . " Revealed religion " ? that disclosure of Himself which Christians declared God had made in Jesus ? was criticized or rejected in favour of " natural religion " ? what man was supposed to have discovered on his own initiative from the observation and study of the world about him . Jesus might still be honoured and God believed in , but it was Jesus as a man who had been a great discoverer of God and it was a God who had created the world and the moral law and who must be regarded with reverence and awe , but a  | God who had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeeming man . In this natural religion , this f deism , Jesus might be important , but he was not given so central a place as formerly . On the other hand , growing minorities of Christians denied the right of the community as represented by the state to enforce religious uniformity . They stood for religious liberty and for the separation of Church and state . These extremists of the Protestant movement first had their way in the New World . There , in the British zone , some of them established colonies which sought to practise this toleration ? notably in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania . When , in the last quarter of the eighteenth century , the Thirteen Colonies achieved their political independence of the British Empire , the principle of religious liberty and of the separation of Church from state was incorporated in the constitution of the new Federal Government . In time it became the rule in each of the states . In the United States the separation of Church and state was partly the work of men of deistic tendencies and partly of earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church and the world did not necessarily mean that the influence of Jesus was declining . It meant in part that the Church was demanding of all its members a closer approximation in practice to the teaching of Jesus . As we have suggested , between A.D. 1500 and A.D. 1800 the impulse front Jesus gave greater vigour to the religious life of western Europe than ex er before . We have noted how this manifested itself in the sixteenth century in the rise of Protestant movements and in the Catholic Reformation . It continued in the seventeenth century . For instance , in Great Britain Puritanism then came to its flowering , and the Corn-  | monwealth period was marked by the presence of many religious sects , each of which was an expression of vitality , even though at times this took somewhat bizarre forms . The seventeenth century saw the rise of Quakerism , and the founder , George Fox , believed profoundly that he was preaching the true Gospel of Jesus Christ . In France , Vincent de Paul , with his passion for the care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorer classes , founded the Congregation of the Mission , or the Lazarists , which later spread to many parts of the world . In Germany , in spite of the destruction and the sag in civilization brought by the Thirty Years ' War , Pietism had its inception and brought new life into the Lutheran churches . In Pietism was a notable instance of what has often happened . From the impulse given by Jesus revivals have repeatedly come at the times when Christianity has seemed most sterile and moribund . Often they have arisen in the very districts where the outlook for Christianity has appeared most unpromising . This was vividly illustrated in the eighteenth century . Then over most of western Europe the fire seemed to have died out in the Church . Cold rationalism led many to discount the Christian faith and even infected official spokesmen for Christianity until they presented their religion as a philosophy and decried all enthusiasm . Yet in Germany at this very time came the Moravian movement , springing in part out of Pietism and having its great leader in Zinzendorf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , partly through contact with the Moravians , and within the decorous but formal and cold Established Church , began the Wesleyan revival and the Evangelical movement . This dated from the quieting and inspiring conviction which  | came so suddenly to John Wesley that he trusted in Christ and in Christ alone for salvation . It was this experience which sent out the formerly somewhat precise Anglican priest to bring the Christian message to the religiously neglected of England and prepared the way for the abounding vitality in the Protestant Christianity of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . In New England , in contrast with the deadening of religious life in the established churches and the easy standards for church membership tolerated by his own father-inlaw , Jonathan Edwards kindled a flame of revival which swept the colonies in the Great Awakening . The reaction against religious sterility which brings about revivals is to be seen in some other religions , but it has been most marked in Christianity , and in the Christianity of the West , where , as we have seen , the impulse from Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions of mankind , only in Christianity have these revivals led to a progressively increasing vigour and power . The historian can speak of the rise and decline of Buddhism , of Hinduism , and of Islam , but , if he be true to the facts , he can speak only of the rise of Christianity . Ile can point in its record to pulsations , to ebb as well as flow , but , thus far at least , he can not speak of the decline of Christianity . On the intellectual life of Europe , at first sight the effect of Jesus was not so obvious between A.D. 1500 and A.D. 1800 as between A.D. 500 and A.D. 1500 . This was probably because scholarship was not so exclusively the possession of the clergy . To be sure , much of the education and most of the universities still had ecclesiastical connexions . Yet , thanks in no small degree to what the Church had accomplished in education , learning had spread to the laity and to men whose chief occupation was not religion . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but some of them no longer gave their major attention to theology . Francis Bacon , who was so prominent in shaping the thought of the seventeenth century , had not been so stirred by Jesus as had Roger Bacon in the thirteenth century . However , many of the most influential minds had either been reared in earnestly Christian environments or had developed a warm personal Christian faith of their own . Copernicus was a churchman . Giordano Bruno , although he came to his death at the hands of the Inquisition , had been a Dominican and in his philosophy continued to believe in God as the unifying substance of the universe . Kepler , astronomer and mathematician , had been trained for the ministry and turned aside from that profession only with great reluctance . Although dissenting from the majority in his religious views , Joseph Priestley , the discoverer of oxygen , was a clergyman . Rene Descartes preserved a genuine piety through the Roman Catholic Church . John Locke , whose writings , particularly the Essay Concerning Human Understanding , had a marked effect upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a child of the Puritan movement ( although he later dissented from much of it ) , was deeply religious , and was so impressed by Jesus that he sought to separate the essence of the teaching of Jesus from later accretions . Sir Isaac Newton was profoundly interested in theology as well as in mathematics . Indeed , he believed his work in theology to be more important than that in mathematics or physics and looked upon his contributions in these latter fields as having their chief significance in their support of the Christian revelation . Emmanuel Kant was nurtured in a warmly Pietist environment and had studied theology . How far if at all the Christian faith of these men was responsible for the  | stimulus which made them intellectually creative we must not attempt to say . That some causal connexion existed seems possible and even probable , but it would be impracticable to attempt to measure it accurately . It is , however , clear that to many great minds theology continued to be an absorbing interest , even though several of them departed from positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diminishing attention to theology does not necessarily mean that the influence of Jesus had declined . It indicates , rather , that the intellectual life was no longer the exclusive possession of those who professed to be thoroughly committed to the Christian way of life . Always since the ostensible conversion of western Europe there had been those whose Christianity was purely nominal . Now , after 1500 , and , indeed , beginning with the Renaissance , interest in scholarship had been extended to include this group . Most of them , however , still owed , directly or indirectly , to the Church and so to the impulse from Jesus the institutions and t he tools which made their scholarship possible . Indeed , most of the notable advances in educational method icc the three centuries from A.D. 1500 to A.D. i800 issued Irons the impulse given by Jesus . Thus John Sturm , one of the greatest schoolmasters of the sixteenth century , was the product of the Brethren of the Common Life and of the Protestant Reformation . Out of the early Lutheran movement , through ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its scholars , Melanchthon and Bugenhagen , came the German Volksschule and a reconstruction of the curricula of some German universities . The schools initiated by Calvin lifted the intellectual level of the rank and file . The schools of the Jesuits , with their ratio studi-  | orum , were among the most progressive and influential of the seventeenth century . The earnest Christian Jansenists of Port Royal spread through France a type of school different from that of the Jesuits , with emphasis on the vernacular and on science . The Moravian Bishop Comenius was one of the most important writers on education in recent centuries and had the Christian faith as his dominant inspiration . The Pietists inaugurated at Halle new types of education which helped to shape the later Prussian system . Towards the end of the eighteenth century the Anglican chaplain Andrew Bell and the Quaker Joseph Lancaster instituted new forms of education for the masses , and the Methodist Robert Raikes began the Sunday Schools for the same purpose . In the charity schools so widely spread in the British Isles in the eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second half of the century , the earnestly Christian Pestalozzi gave a great impulse to new ideas in education . By these and scores of others who drew their inspiration ultimately from Jesus , new methods were devised and successful attempts were made to open the doors of learning not only to the privileged but also to the rank and file of the population . We must also recall the large part which Christianity had in making provision for the education of peoples of European stock outside of Europe . In the European settlements in the Americas , the Church founded most of such schools as existed . This was true both in the Spanish possessions ( witness the universities begun by the clergy and looking to the Pope for their official license ) and in the English colonies , where the oldest colleges , with one possible exception , were founded primarily for the training of the clergy . In great literature the influence of Jesus was not always  | so prominent as before A.D. 1500 . Shakespeare , for instance , was much less dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world and to life was profoundly affected by what had come to him through Christianity , Goethe did not really commit himself to the faith or the discipline of Jesus . Yet this seeming decline in the literary influence of Jesus was more apparent than real . It was probably due in large part to the spread of literary attainments beyond the clerical profession . Moreover , it must be recalled that much of the popular poetry of the Middle Ages was as untouched by Jesus as was any of the literature of the centuries between A.D. 1500 and A.D. 1800 . We need to remember , too , that when , with the Renaissance , laymen began to be prominent in literature , a large proportion of what they wrote was as unaffected by Christianity or was as rebellious against the outlook and the ethics of Jesus as was the work of any writers after them . We ought also to reflect that many of these laymen were deeply stirred by the Christian faith and that their work was moulded by it . It may be , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what in the broad sense may be called literature , both written and unwritten ? although to speak of unwritten literature is , perhaps , a contradiction ? he would discover that the litera y influence of Jesus was more profound after than before A.1 ) . 1500 . For instance , to the sixteenth century belong Tasso and his Jerusalem Delivered . In the seventeenth century came Milton and his Paradise Lost , and John Bunyan , whose Pilgrim 's Progress probably has been translated into more tongues than any other book except the Bible and has become the common property of the Englishspeaking peoples . Luther 's translation of the Bible into Ger-  | man has had a marked effect on German language and popular thought . It was the most powerful factor in establishing what became the standard form of German . Possibly an even deeper impress has been made on thought and on the spoken and written word in the English-speaking world by the King James version of the Christian Scriptures . Most of the Bible , of course , is of pre-Christian origin . Obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Testament , would not have enjoyed its wide circulation among the non-Jewish peoples of Europe ? or of the world as a whole ? but for its use by Jesus and but for the fact that Christians have believed that it prepared the way for Jesus and was fulfilled in him . On music Jesus continued to leave his mark . Often he was its inspiration . In these three centuries music displayed a phenomenal development and for that progress and for the quality of music produced with its effect on the human spirit Jesus was largely responsible . The oratorio took shape first through the Oratory of St. Philip Neri , a religious institution which was part of the earliest flowering of the Roman Catholic Reformation . Palestrina , who was a pioneer in combining musical science with musical feeling , found his opportunity in the Church . He felt profoundly the significance of the Eucharist and one of his greatest achievements was his contribution to the rising tide of the revival expressed through the Roman Catholic Reformation by the composition of music for the mass . Bach also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church and was inspired by the Christian faith to some of his best work ? and some of the greatest music ever written . Handel 's oratorios ? as their name indicates , on Biblical themes ? especially the Messiah , centring about Jesus , have become a permanent  | part of the musical tradition not only of Europe but also of the world . Haydn was indebted for his foundation in music to his boyhood training in a cathedral choir . Mozart was the son of the kapellmeister to the Archbishop of Salzburg , and thus through the support given by the Church became even in childhood a musical prodigy . From the beginning the faith that stemmed from Jesus has been a singing faith . Through these years it continued to give birth to song . It is no accident that in these three centuries hundreds of carols came into being , inspired by the nativity of Jesus . Nor is it fortuitous that the Moravian revival with its loyalty to Jesus has had musical expressions which have become famous among music-lovers the world over . In art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be sure , secular subjects were more frequent among the painters than before 1500 , and a Titian made even religious themes express a voluptuousness which was not in accord with Jesus . Yet some of the greatest painting and sculpture which the human hand has ever produced dealt with topics connected with the story of Jesus and with the 01 ( 1 Testament as a preparation for him . Jesus stimulated genius and modified its expression , placing on it something of his own stamp . Michelangelo did much of his greatest work under the inspiration of the Christian faith and in the service of the Church . The same was true of Raphael . The best remembered achievement of the brilliant and incredibly versatile Leonardo da Vinci is his " Last Supper . " Albrecht Diirer was profoundly religious and was deeply stirred by the Lutheran movement . The Renaissance brought a revival of pre-Christian classical forms in architecture and made for the unpopularity  | of the medieval Gothic which had been developed under Christian auspices and inspiration . However , the classical style was frequently utilized for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest church in Christendom and the central shrine of the Roman Catholic world , it was made to serve Christian worship . So , too , with St. Paul 's in London and with the many church edifices which attest the genius of Sir Christopher Wren . In the New World the chaste and severe " colonial " meeting-houses of New England show what one expression of the Christian spirit could do with an architectural tradition which went back to a pagan past . As in so many other phases of life , the impulse from Jesus took over forms which had been begun under other auspices , employed them for its own purposes , and made of them something distinctive , peculiar to itself . In the realm of economics the appraisal of the influence of Jesus is particularly difficult . If , for instance , the Christian motive operated decisively to bring about the phenomenal expansion of European peoples , then the great increase in commerce and wealth which marked the Europe of the period must be in part ascribed to Jesus . However , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explorations and the settlements , it is impossible to determine whether the expansion of Europe would have taken place without them . It is clear that in this period the Roman Catholic Church was not as active or as prominent in its attempt to make the economic life of Europe conform to Christian principles as it had been in the Middle Ages . We have , on the other hand , the hypothesis confidently put forward that the origin and the early stages of the capitalist economy were greatly aided by Calvinism and were perhaps primarily due to it . If true , this would mean that responsi-  | bility for this stage of economic life can be traced in part to Jesus . Yet the hypothesis , so brilliantly argued , has been vigorously denied , and much evidence has been diligently amassed and ably presented to support the denial . With our present state of information , we must be very cautious in venturing a decided opinion . What place did Jesus have in the wars of the period ? The centuries were punctuated by frequent strife between and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrowth of the effort of the kings to establish their autocratic power and of their subjects to check it . Many were waged for the purpose of aggrandizing a royal family by the heads of states in which the monarchs had come to enhanced authority . In numbers of wars the commercial element was prominent . Yet some were called wars of religion , and in several the controversy between Roman Catholic and Protestant entered prominently . Of these latter the impulse which came from Jesus may be termed a contributory cause . In none , however , was it the only cause , and in few was it the major one . If Jesus at times contributed to the wars of Europe , it is dear that front hint came movements which sought to place on the basis of law the relations between states and so to reduce the lreclucttcy and to mitigate the severity of war . The Papacy no longer enjoyed the political prestige which it possessed before the emergence of the strong monarchies of the modern period . Several of the Popes of the fifteenth and sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territorial dominion in Italy and subordinated the policies of the Church universal to their interests as Italian princes . The Protestant revolt had torn from the Papacy many of the regions where the word of Rome was once  | potent . In several Protestant lands , notably in England and in Lutheran countries , the Church was too subservient to the state to speak independently and with authority in matters of international import . Even in the major Roman Catholic kingdoms the monarchs controlled the Church and were impatient with the intervention of the Pope in their affairs . He whom Roman Catholics termed the Vicar of Christ could not , therefore , hope to put into effect what he deemed the will of God as at times in the Middle Ages he had essayed to do . However , it was largely through the impulse from Jesus that a new source of control arose ? what has come to be called international law . Much of this harked back to legal ideas of the pre-Christian Greco-Roman world , but the underlying motive seems chiefly to have had a Christian source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominican , famous as a theologian , gave to international law its earliest important treatises . Even more commanding was the contribution of Hugo Grotius . Grotius , a liberal Protestant , was deeply interested in his faith and frankly said that it was the spectacle of Christian peoples at war with one another which urged him to his task . He declared , too , that the New Testament enjoined a higher law than that law of nature which had been extolled by ancient pagan writers . International law , rudimentary though it was , and feeble though it frequently proved to be , marked an advance over the medieval Papacy in bringing some kind of order into the chaos of the relations among the states of Europe . The Christian spirit proved itself adaptable to the new conditions . It was still far from completely transforming interstate relations into conformity to its ideals , but more than at any previous time the influence of Jesus was becoming a factor in making for peace among European peoples .  | The relief of poverty and of illness continued to owe an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor and the sick had passed under lay auspices , but this does not mean necessarily that it was less due to motives which sprang from Jesus than when it was exclusively under the Church . Moreover , a large proportion of it was still provided for by ecclesiastical and semi-ecclesiastical institutions and organizations . Within the Roman Catholic Church new orders and congregations arose , one of whose purposes was the relief of physical distress . From Jesus came incentives for the remoulding of society to make it conform more clearly to ideals which it was believed that he had set forth . We have seen that in the Middle Ages efforts to attain to a better social order were confined to monasteries and to small sects which set about the construction of self-contained communities with no thought of altering the society that embraced all Christians , and to volcanic outbursts of rage from the underprivileged against the possessing classes which sometimes had leaders who professed to be attempting to realize New Testament principles . After A.D. 1500 monasteries continued , although not so prominently . Sects multiplied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large scale societies which would fully incorporate Christian principles . This was true of several of the settlements which gave rise to New England . It was true , too , in Pennsylvania . All these American Protestant experiments , to be sure , were founded by persecuted groups who wished to be free from the oppressions from which they suffered in Europe . They were reinforced , moreover , by settlers who came with the ambition to better their economic lot . However , they were also due to the desire to found here  | on earth communities which would be completely Christian in life ? in the New World to make a fresh beginning , unencumbered by the traditions and the restraints of Europe , and to build a new order . This idealism had much to do with creating the spirit and shaping the programme of the United States . Then , also , some of the Roman Catholic missions of this period endeavoured to transform native pagan societies into Christian ones . This was particularly the case in the famous Jesuit mission in Paraguay and , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines . It is interesting to recall that the Utopia which gave a name for all visionary plans for reconstructing society was by Sir Thomas More , who died a martyr for what he believed to be true Christianity . More 's Utopia , to be sure , appears by no means to have been consciously an attempt to set forth a plan for a Christian order of society . Little in its verbiage is specifically Christian . Yet something of the faith which maintained its author through his imprisonment and trial and made him courageous at the execution block may have provided an incentive for this , his best-remembered book . The Utopia is only the most famous of many projects for social betterment put out in literary form in part under Christian inspiration . The Christian apocalypticism which in the Middle Ages had been the parent of proposals for the reconstruction of society now came to even more notable fruition . Gflnzberg 's Wolfaria , and especially Andrea 's Chri , stianopolis and James Harrington 's Oceana were the more widely influential of many plans set forth largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals for the radical reconstruction of society . Attempts were made to put some of these dreams into  | practice . Thus came the famous Anabaptist experiment at Munster . The settlements in America which we have mentioned belong in a similar category . Later , in England , the revolution which brought in the Commonwealth was largely due to a purpose ? or purposes , for the programmes set forth by the several sects were many ? of making England a nation conforming to Christian principles . Oliver Cromwell was inspired by what he believed to be Christian purposes . So , too , the philosophers whose dream of a perfect society helped to give birth to the French Revolution and to shape it grew up in a culture in which the Christian element was strong . Many of them were impatient with the organized Church and rejected orthodox theology . Yet much for which they stood had historically a Christian origin . It would be interesting to attempt to discover to what extent the characteristics of particular European nations are due to the type of Christianity which has prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch the product of Calvinism ( which was not native to either but an importation ) ? I low far do the English bear the impress of Anglicanism ? Or is Anglicanism the outgrowth of the English spirit ? Or has each helped to produce the other ? To what degree is modern Scandinavia the fruit of Lutheranism ? To what extent is modern Spain the result of the Roman Catholicism of Philip 1I ? No exact appraisal which is demonstrable is possible , but the questions are important . It would be a hold assertion , difficult of conclusive proof , that modern political democracy is an outgrowth of the influence of Jesus . Yet it must be noted that there was something in the essence of the Protestant interpretation of the Christian Gospel which made for democracy . Protestantism tended to stand for the duty as well as the right of private  | judgment . It declared that every true Christian had been born again through the grace of God in Christ and that every person so born had direct access to God without the intervention of priest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of all true Christians , and so gave rise to local churches which , as communities of such Christians , were in theory pure democracies . To be sure , those bodies into which most of the Protestants of Europe and Britain were gathered did not carry this principle to its logical conclusion . It was only in such movements as the various kinds of Anabaptists and Independents that Protestants had the courage to go the whole way in carrying out their belief in the priesthood of all believers . It is significant that from Dissenters , in which these groups were prominent , has come much of such democracy as exists in England , and that in the first large nation to strive towards the goal of democracy , the United States , these radically Protestant groups have been particularly strong . In the United States frontier conditions contributed to this outcome , but in the French portions of Canada , where frontier conditions also existed at much the same time and were moulded by many of the same climatic factors , but where Roman Catholicism , not radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was an importation of the British . Something in the impulse from Jesus seems to make for repeated efforts for the reconstruction of society and for the creation of new societies designed to embody the teachings of the Gospels . Those attempts have been most numerous in western Europe and among peoples of western European descent . It was in western Europe , we must remind ourselves repeatedly , that between A.D. 500 and A.D. 1500 Christianity had freest course , least hampered by a state with  | pagan traditions . It was from revivals which resulted from attempts to lead thoroughgoing Christian lives that various idealistic societies arose ? first monasteries , then the Franciscan and Dominican brotherhoods and the medieval sects , then Protestantism and the new orders which led in the Catholic Reformation . In the forming of such societies the impulse from Jesus was stronger between A.D. 1500 and A.D. 1800 than it had been before . It was to be still stronger and more widespread after A.D. 1800 . The three centuries between A.D. 1500 and A.D. 1800 , then , were signalized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revivals within Christianity of unprecedented vigour and extent , partly in geographic expansion , partly in effects upon non-European peoples and in modifying for good the impact of Europeans upon nonEuropeans , and partly in a deepening impression on some phases of European culture . In no major section of the globe and iii few minor ones was Jesus dominant . In some areas of life the opposition to that for which he had stood was on a more gigantic scale than ever . Yet that he was a growing factor in t'lie life of mankind no one can well deny . In Europe the Church was no longer so in control of society as in the Middle Ages . It was divided and subject to secularized states . Yet Jesus was more potent in shaping the life of European peoples than he had been in medieval times and a missionary movement of unprecedented vigour and magnitude was carrying his influence to lands where hitherto it had never reached .  | A s AT the close of the fifth and of the fifteenth century , so in the latter part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of Jesus seemed dark . In Europe , the major stronghold of the faith which was the chief channel for the influence of Jesus , much of scepticism was openly expressed . The so-called Enlightenment affected the attitude of the educated . What was termed " revealed religion " was at a discount and what was called " natural religion " was prized . This meant , in effect , that Jesus was being demoted from the place which he had heretofore occupied as the unique relevation of God . Kind words were sometimes spoken of him by those who took that position , but he was in danger of being ushered out , politely but effectively . Moreover , towards the end of the eighteenth century came the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars . For over a quarter of a century Europe was in turmoil . Some of the more radical elements wished to be rid of Christianity . Napoleon , too , dealt cavalierly with the Church . In the time of confusion and war , with so much that was contrary to all for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a waning factor in the life of Europe . . When , in 1815 , the Treaty of Vienna at last brought the Napoleonic wars to a close , mankind , and especially the Occident , found itself in a strange new world . For a time ,  | to be sure , the elements which had triumphed over Napoleon attempted to turn back the clock and to restore the old order . That , however , proved impossible . New political and social ideas were current . For about a hundred years after 1815 the swing was towards democracy and what came to be known as political liberalism . The development of the scientific approach broadened man 's intellectual horizons . Mankind extended its knowledge of its physical environment beyond the dreams of the wildest fancy . At the same time man rapidly increased his mastery over his physical environment . The machine age dawned . The Industrial Revolution , already beginning , continued . The steamship , the railway , the telegraph , the telephone , and , later , the automobile , wireless , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into being . Industrial cities arose . The social , political , economic , and intellectual structure of man 's life was profoundly altered . These changes , which began in the Occident , spread around the world . European peoples entered upon a fresh expansion . They dominated a large proportion of the earth 's surface . In North America they settled the Mississippi Valley , the plains west of the Great Lakes , the Rocky Mountain area , and the Pacific slope . In South America new nations of European blood developed , notably in the southern part of the continent . Migration from the British Isles gave birth to new commonwealths in Australia and New Zealand . In South Africa Boers and British brought into being another new nation . It was not only in these new communities of European stock that Western peoples spread . They also penetrated to regions where other races remained in the majority . Their commerce covered the earth . Their political control was extended over all the Western Hemisphere , over practically  | all of Africa , over more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Non-Occidental lands which remained entirely or partially politically independent , such as Japan and China , preserved that autonomy by adopting Western culture . The Occident was being revolutionized , and the revolutionized Occident was revolutionizing the world . Could the influence of Jesus keep pace with these kaleidoscopic changes ? It had been most pronounced among northern and western European peoples . Would it continue to grow among them and would it be strong enough to modify , after its own pattern , the impact of Occidental upon nonOccidental peoples ? Many were the forces which seemed to be elbowing Jesus out of this emerging area . Much of the new science appeared to threaten the world view which made Jesus central in the life of man and a unique revelation of the heart of the universe . Was there a place for God in the expanding universe which the instruments of the scientists revealed ? Was not that universe purely one of electrical force , of light waves , of protons , electrons , atoms , molecules , and untold myriads of suns ? Was there room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of intelligence and will ? When the earth had been regarded as of importance in the physical universe , it did not seem preposterous to set forth Jesus as the Son of God . However , the earth had shrunk to the position of a minor planet of a middle-sized star which in turn was only one of millions of suns of one of the myriads of stellar systems . Was it not utterly fantastic to claim for one of the billions of evanescent beings called men who had come into existence only a fraction of a moment ago ? measured by sidereal time ? on a speck of a planet the role of a revelation of the heart of that vast universe . Many believed so . Others ,  | not yet fully convinced , were shaken in their inherited faith . A number of governments , moreover , disestablished the churches which were the official perpetuation of the influence of Jesus . The secularization of the state , the independence of government from control by the Church which had been in progress from at least as early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not since before Constantine had so many governments within so-called Christendom separated Church from state . Governments traditionally committed to Jesus were , in effect , formally disavowing that loyalty . Here and there , after 1917 , in numbers of lands came active war on Christianity . The religion centring about Jesus had long been the community faith of western and northern European peoples . It was now being dethroned . The machine age introduced ethical problems and gave rise to gigantic intergroup conflicts and to social stresses on a prodigious scale . The new industrial classes , the product of the machine age , tended to drift away from the Church and to ignore Jesus . Many of the leaders in social reorganization rebelled against the Church or , more ominously still , ignored the Church and Jesus . Traditional institutions and customs , notably the family and marriage , on which Jesus had had an effect , were threatened with disintegration . For most of the hundred years after 1815 wars within the Occident were relatively minor incidents . Most wars were on the periphery of the Occident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , armaments were mounting and nationalism was becoming more intense . In 1914 they exploded in a war from which civilization has not yet recovered ? and war destroys values painfully built in the name of Jesus . Yet , in spite of these vast new forces and of these threats to his influence , never has Jesus made himself felt over so  | large a proportion of the earth 's surface and never has he made so marked an impress upon the human race as in the little less than a century and a half since A.D. 1800 . This deepened impress has been made both in what has been known as Christendom and on peoples hitherto little or entirely untouched by Jesus . Never has Jesus been so potent in t the affairs of men as in the past fourteen decades . The years from Anno Domini 1800 to Annum Domini 1940 have been the period in which he has moulded mankind as never before . This does not mean , of course , that Jesus has prevailed in all the affairs of men . Never have the contradictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic or appalling a scale . Never , however , has he been so prominent : It is the chief expressions of this influence of Jesus which we must now describe . First of all was a series of revivals which made Christianity ? that religion which centres about Jesus ? more vigorous than in any previous period . The recession in Christianity which came at the close of the eighteenth century was not so marked as that between the fifth and the eleventh century , or as that at the close of the fifteenth century . The seventeenth century had seen awakenings in Protestantism and the eighteenth century had witnessed the flowering of Pietism , the Moravian Movement , the Great Awakening in America , and the Wesleyan revival . In Roman Catholicism the seventeenth century had included new efforts to deepen the spiritual life , to quicken the masses of nominal Christians , and to give to the non-Christian world the message of Jesus . In the nineteenth century came awakenings on an unprecedented scale in Roman Catholicism and Protestantism ?  | in those very parts of Christendom where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prominent . In the Roman Catholic Church many new orders and congregations sprang into being . In that form of Christianity a new order or congregation usually arises because a man or a woman has made a fresh commitment to Jesus and has attracted others to do likewise . In the nineteenth century more new orders and congregations appeared within the Roman Catholic Church than in any previous hundred years . In several lands the Church was disestablished , but in some countries this seeming repudiation by the state liberated the Church from its traditional utilization as a tool of secular policy and led to a deepening of its life . Never before had the Roman Catholic Church been served by so many devoted spirits . Never had the average moral and intellectual level of its clergy been so high . This deepening of the spiritual life of the Roman Catholic Church was associated with a renewed emphasis upon Jesus and upon practices and beliefs connected with him . Devotion to the Holy Heart of Jesus became prominent . Fresh stress was placed by the hierarchy and by popular Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteenth century , for instance , that the dogma of the Immaculate Concept ion was formally promulgated . The second half of the nineteenth century witnessed added emphasis upon the Fucharist . Frequent communions were encouraged . The twentieth century saw the growing prominence of Eucharistic Congresses , centring about the sacrifice and the belief in the real presence of Jesus . It was , however , the types of Christianity known collectively as Protestantism in which the new life was the most potent . Indeed , the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have  | been the Protestant era of Christianity . Marked as has been the vigour of Roman Catholicism , it is Protestantism that has experienced the greatest proportionate gains and through which Jesus has most profoundly affected mankind . The Eastern Churches have displayed little new life . Some have lost numbers to Roman Catholicism and Protestantism and even to Islam . After 1917 the largest of the Eastern bodies , the Russian Orthodox Church , experienced major losses to Communism . In the past fourteen decades it is Protestantism which has been the most active spiritual force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of its birth it increased in numbers and in power . In the United States it had a phenomenal growth . There it was particularly effective along the frontiers of settlement . It was powerful in the new nations formed by Anglo-Saxons ? Canada , Australia , and New Zealand ? and in the Anglo-Saxon elements in South Africa . In the United States in A.D. 1800 a series of revivals broke out along the frontier , in the very areas where the white population seemed to be drifting away from its ancestral faith . These revivals sought to win men and women from the outbreaking vices of the section and to bring them into conformity with the ideals of Jesus . The churches which arose on the frontier strove by precept and discipline to maintain moral standards above those of the community about them . The revivals continued intermittently throughout the nineteenth century and affected the cities and older portions of the land as well as the rural districts and the new settlements . Charles G. Finney in the first half and Dwight L. Moody in the second half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders in the awakening . Both  | Finney and Moody extended their activities to the British Isles . In Scotland the new life manifested itself in part in the emergence of the Free Church of Scotland . To a large degree this was a protest against the subordination of the Church to a secular state and secular landed proprietors and an insistence that the conscience inspired by Jesus must be freed from domination by elements whose interests were not primarily religious . The Free Church of Scotland , by the Disruption , was deprived of endowments and buildings . However , so vigorous was the life which called it into existence that by voluntary contributions new houses of worship were erected , the clergy supported , and extensive foreign missions undertaken . In England the abounding new vigour was expressed partly in the growth of the Free Churches , partly in the strength of the Evangelicals ( those within the Church of England who continued the Wesleyan tradition ) and in part in the Oxford or Anglo-Catholic Movement . This last , like the Free Church of Scotland , came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the body of Christ , should not be subservient to the secular state . It did not necessarily object to a close association between Church and state but it insisted that the Church must have its own independent life and not be simply an arm of the state . Like the other revivals of the century , it was an attempt to give freer channel for the impulse which had come into the world through Jesus . On the continent of Europe the Protestant churches were profoundly stirred . Some of this came through an expansion of the indigenous Pietism . Some of it was by contagion from the revivals in Great Britain and America . Some of it ex-  | pressed itself in the realm of the intellect ? in new ventures in theology , the attempt to arrive at a fresh understanding of God and His place in the universe and of Jesus , and in minute and fearless investigation of the original documents of the Christian faith . The study of the New Testament especially sought for a better comprehension of Jesus , of his teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the beliefs about him held by the early Christians . Out of these awakenings in Protestantism sprang many new movements . The Young Men 's and Young Women 's Christian Associations were attempts to win to an allegiance to Jesus the youth of the cities which as a result of the Industrial Revolution were having such a mushroom growth . Through religious meetings and Bible study they sought to make for an earnest and intelligent religious life . Through physical education and recreation they endeavoured to give wholesome diversion and strong bodies to youth caught in the meshes of an urban civilization . Through schools they helped prepare youths of modest incomes to find places efficiently and happily in an industrial era . The Salvation Army came into being primarily to reach those less fortunate elements in the great new cities who had succumbed to commercialized vice . Many a " rescue mission " arose to redeem the flotsam and jetsam of an industrial age , to serve the underprivileged , and to rebuild those whom the burdens of life had broken . Thus there was a mission for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshoot of it , the remarkable mission of Sir Wilfred Grenfell to the fishermen of Labrador . The Sunday Schools were called into existence , at the outset as a means of educating poor children in both secular and religious subjects , but eventually as an agency for the religious nurture of youth deprived of the accustomed means of  | that instruction by the secularization of week-day schools and the weakening of the home . The Christian Endeavour Societies and the many kindred organizations were successful efforts at enlisting youth in the Christian enterprise . The Student Christian Movements , most of them affiliated through the World 's Student Christian Federation , sought , and also with marked success , to reach youth ? in this instance the youth who were most affected by the intellectual currents of the age and who , presumably , were potential leaders . All of these organizations professed to draw their inspiration from Jesus . In many of them the name Christ or Christian was central . In the new denominations which arose the word Christ was more prominent than in the earlier divisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calvinist , Baptist , Anabaptist , Congregational , Presbyterian , Mennonite , and Friends . Among the more prominent denominations with a nineteenth-century origin were , significantly , the Christians and the Disciples of Christ . Even two bodies widely separated from historic Christianity gave prominence to the name of Jesus or of Christ ? Christian Science ( the Church of Christ , Scientist ) , and the Clulrcli of the Latter Day Saints of Jesus Christ ( the Mormons ) . Through these many movements , Protestantism became more vigorous than ever it had been . It was more purely a religious movement and was more whole-heartedly committed in undivided allegiance to Jesus than ever before . At its inception Protestantism arose from a mixture of motives . Always in it were earnest souls who were caught by Jesus . Usually , however , the main bodies of Protestants derived assistance from secular rulers who saw in them a means of  | enhancing their own power . Thus Henry VIII and Elizabeth had a large share in moulding the Church of England , and both of them were actuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German princes saw in Lutheranism the means of perfecting their control over the Church in their states unhampered by that interference of the Papacy which for centuries had balked the German Emperors in their attempts to strengthen their hold on their realm . In Sweden Gustavus Vasa seems to have espoused the Reformation as much from political as from religious motives . To be sure , always in Protestantism had been groups which had protested against the mixture of non-Christian and Christian elements in the Church and had insisted upon an exclusive loyalty to Jesus . Until the nineteenth century , however , these had been in the minority . In the nineteenth century the major revivals which brought fresh vitality to Protestantism drew their inspiration and their support more single-heartedly from Jesus . Some of them , as we have seen , sought deliberately to free themselves from subservience to the secular state . Others arose quite independently of a connexion with the state . Through these processes the antithesis between Jesus and the society in the midst of which Christians were set became more striking . Always a tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fourth centuries , it will be recalled , the favourite solution had been by the way of monasticism . By it those who wished fully to follow Jesus separated themselves as far as possible from the world about them into communities which they sought to make conform to the teachings of Jesus . The vast majority of Christians continued to live in the world . Indeed , Christianity was a community faith with which , by the accident of birth , all in a particular region except a few Jews possessed a formal connexion . In  | the nineteenth and twentieth centuries two tendencies , already visible in the preceding period , became increasingly apparent . They arose from contrasting motives but led to the same end . On the one hand governments were severing the tie between Church and state . In this they were directed by those who were irked by the interference of ecclesiastics in politics and by the opposition offered by the hierarchy to reforms . Many were also actuated by antagonism to those features of Christianity which were derived from Jesus . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were believing that all who called themselves Christians should take Jesus as seriously as had the monks ? although that did not necessarily lead to celibacy or to a complete separation from non-Christian society . Increasingly , especially in lands where the Anglo-Saxon tradition prevailed , Protestants were dreaming in terms of the transformation of human society by churches fully committed to Jesus . Not only in Roman Catholicism and Protestantism but also outside the orthodox circles of these great branches of the Christian movement a fresh interest in Jesus developed . Many lives of Jesus were written , some by churchmen in good standing and some by scholars whom the churches repudiated . Especially did the studies by Strauss , Renan , and Seeley create a sensation . There was a rediscovery of the Jesus who walked the hills of Galilee and Judea . Never in any equal length of time had the records of his life been studied so minutely and never had so many books and articles been written about him . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries Christianity displayed its exceptional vigour not only in revivals among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a phenomenal expansion . By this expansion , even more than in the preced-  | ing period , the influence of Jesus made itself felt more widely than that of any other being who had ever walked the planet . This spread of Christianity paralleled that of European peoples . However , it did not automatically accompany Europeans on their globe-wide wanderings . It was only because of men and women who had been gripped by Jesus that the faith was carried so far . In general , the expansion took two forms . Christianity was built into the structure of the new nations which emerged from the migrations of Europeans , and it was carried to peoples who previously had been professedly non-Christian . As we have seen , new nations of European stock arose in the United States , in Canada , in the southern part of South America , in Australia , in New Zealand , and in South Africa . The United States , Canada , and the southern republics of South America were built upon foundations which had been laid before A.D. 1800 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The increase was in part by the multiplication through births of the population which had been in the Americas before A.D. 1800 and in part was by fresh migrations from Europe . The territory effectively occupied after A.D. 1800 was many times that peopled before that year . In the United States , not only was this enlargement of population paralleled by an increase of those who called themselves Christians , but also the actual proportion of the population who had a formal church connexion was considerably greater in the twentieth than it had been at the dawn of the nineteenth century . The percentage of whites who were avowed Christians in the twentieth century was at least twice or three times that of A.D. 1800 . In addition , about half of the several millions of negroes had accepted the  | faith of their white neighbours and former masters ? as against a very small percentage at the close of the eighteenth century . Many , too , of the aboriginal inhabitants , the Indians , had been won to the faith . In other words , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace with the phenomenal growth of the white population and to attract as well about half of the previously nonChristian negroes and Indians . Much of this expansion of Christianity in the United States was by the local efforts of thousands of Christians ? of those to whom their religion meant so much that they propagated it without stimulus from the outside . They founded churches , nurtured their children in the faith , and won others to it . Much , too , was by organized effort initiated and supported from Europe and from the longer-settled portions of the United States . The expansion of the influence of Jesus in the United States was not confined to any one branch of his followers . Of those who called themselves Christians in i800 the large majority were Protestants . Protestants continued to predominate . They organized home mission societies which followed the settlements on the frontier . Leaders among the nineteenth-century Protestant immigrants from Europe , especially those from Germany , Scandinavia , and Holland , organized churches for their fellows . Protestantism set the temper of the Christianity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great majority of the Roman Catholics came as poverty-stricken immigrants . It speaks volumes for the vigour of the religious conviction among them and among their fellow-believers in Europe that churches and schools were built and a clergy trained and that the vast majority of the immigrants remained true to their  | ancestral faith . Indeed , so eager were the Roman Catholic leaders to give the children a religious rearing that a vast system of parochial schools was created and maintained by voluntary gifts , and this in addition to the taxes paid for the maintenance of the state schools . Much assistance in money and personnel came from Europe , but the major portions of the funds and of the clergy and their lay assistants were derived from the immigrants and their descendants . Most of the Eastern churches were also represented in the United States by immigrant constituencies and developed organizations of their own . In Canada the development was not unlike that in the United States . Here , to be sure , because of the continuing British connexion , the typical English and Scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Methodist were relatively more prominent . Moreover , the strong French enclave , loyal to its ancestral Church , gave its peculiar tinge to the Roman Catholicism of the Dominion . It is important to notice , however , that , whatever its form , Christianity became fully as potent as in the parent countries . Transplantation did not decrease the vigour or the influence of Jesus . In South America the situation was somewhat different . Roman Catholicism was dominant . Moreover , it was a Roman Catholicism which had never enjoyed freedom of action but had always been subject to the state . In colonial days the Church , like the state , had been closely controlled from the mother-countries and had enjoyed little independent life . When , in the nineteenth century , independence came , the Church was deprived of much of its leadership , derived . as that . had been from Europe . The new governments sought to exercise the power over the Church which the Spanish and Portuguese crowns had formerly possessed . This brought the  | Church into partisan politics . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one surviving stronghold of the old regime , was obscurantist intellectually and religiously , and was the bulwark of an outmoded social and economic order . However , the Roman Catholic Church survived . That , with all its weaknesses , it perpetuated much of the influence of Jesus is seen in the writings even of some of the liberals who looked askance at the Church and , more spectacularly , in the well-known statue of the Christ of the Andes . Moreover , Protestantism entered , partly through commercial and immigrant communities , and partly through missions . The latter were chiefly from the United States . Protestant churches came into being and grew rapidly . They were particularly strong in Brazil , but they were also important elsewhere . In Australia and New Zealand , where the European stock was even more predominantly from the British Isles than in Canada , Christianity became an integral part of the life of the new nations and so enabled Jesus to place his impress upon them . As in the United States and Canada , this was chiefly through the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother-lands . In South Africa the Dutch elements were tenacious supporters of their Reformed Church . To them it was at once a symbol and an indispensable instrument of their solidarity against the British on the one hand and against the blacks on the other . However , in it were leaders whose interest was not racial but religious , who had been profoundly moved by the new currents of life in Britain and Europe , and who drew their inspiration from Jesus . Then , too , among the British who came in force in the nineteenth century the influence of Jesus was present . The churches which they had known at  | home , notably the Anglican , the Wesleyan , and the Presbyterian , were a part of their life . It was not only among these new nations of European stock that Jesus was a force . He also became an important factor among practically all non-European and hitherto non-Christian peoples . A missionary movement of unprecedented magnitude carried him into all the corners of the earth . This missionary movement arose out of the abounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means exhausted in the effort to perpetuate the influence of Jesus among the new nations of European blood . It gave rise to hundreds of foreign missionary societies and , in the Roman Catholic Church , to numbers of new missionary orders and congregations . These sent out tens of thousands of missionaries . They were supported by the voluntary gifts of millions of Christians . Never had any other set of ideas , religious or secular , been propagated over so wide an area by so many professional agents maintained by the unconstrained donations of so many millions of individuals . As the decades wore on , the missionary movement continued to grow in magnitude . Only recently , and then merely in some of its phases , have the disorders of the post-1914 years wrought a diminution in it . For sheer magnitude it has been without parallel in human history . It need scarcely be said that never in any preceding period had Christianity developed such an extensive missionary enterprise . Never before had so many Christians joined , through their gifts , in making possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations been formed for that purpose . Never had there been so many missionaries . It is highly significant , moreover , that not since the initial two or three centuries of its history had Christianity been  | propagated from such purely religious motives or accepted on such exclusively religious grounds . Not since the first two or three centuries , and possibly not even then , had Jesus been so prominent in the spread of the faith which sprang from him . Beginning even as early as the third century , political motives were prominent in the propagation and in the acceptance of the faith . Such seems to have been the situation which made possible the mass conversion of Armenia . Certainly beginning in the fourth century , with Constantine , Christianity spread quite as much because it was espoused by princes as because of the zeal of missionaries or the compelling attraction of Jesus . Between the fifth and the sixteenth centuries it was largely through secular rulers , although reinforced by missionaries , that Christianity made its way through most of northern Europe . It was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian governments and of the Dutch East India Company that Christianity enjoyed its major numerical gains of the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries . Always , to be sure , the majority of the active missionaries had been actuated primarily by religious motives and had the springs of their activity in Jesus . Usually , however , the way had been cleared for them by princes or by governmental agencies . Often they had come in at the invitation of rulers . Frequently subsidies had been given for political or economic purposes . Sometimes baptism had been forcibly imposed . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , in contrast , political and economic support by imperialistic states and commercial companies was much less prominent . To be sure , it was not entirely absent . A few governments , notably that of France , backed missions for imperialistic purposes . In the vast colonial possessions of the British and among the Indian  | tribes in the United States , state subsidies were often given to mission schools . This , however , was not because these schools were Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever religious faith or of no faith , which had the initiative to organize schools and maintain certain educational standards would have been given the same assistance . Outside American territory , the thousands of missionaries from the United States have never been given any more protection by their government than has been accorded any other class of citizens . In the early part of the nineteenth century the English East India Company , in whose hands was long placed the administration of British interests in India and the Far East , was actively opposed to missionaries ? on the ground that they might injure trade and reduce profits . Sometimes British and American diplomatic and consular officers have been very cool towards missionaries and have been reluctant to afford them the protection which has been legally theirs . The prestige of Occidental powers and of Western culture has been of assistance in the spread of the faith , but the state has given much less active support to the spread of Christianity than in most earlier centuries . The impulse from Jesus has been more potent in the motives from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twentieth centuries than in those of any other period since the first two or three centuries . It would , of course , be absurd to claim that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the acceptance of Christianity has been purely because of the attraction of the person of Jesus and of the salvation which God is believed to work through him . Some converts have come because they desired education , or because , as in the case of the outcastes of India , baptism has seemed to be the means of escape from age-long  | servitude and obloquy . Some have come because the missionary has appeared to possess a magic more powerful than that of the priests or the witch-doctors of the other faiths . Some have become Christians because the new faith has seemed more potent than the old in freeing them or their cattle from illness or other misfortune . Only a relatively few have at the outset sought admission to the Church because of the compelling winsomeness of Jesus . Here and there have been those who have come from a great moral or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These , however , have been the exception . Only gradually , if at all , have the neophytes understood Jesus . Yet it must also be said that never since the first few centuries have missionaries set such high standards for admission to the Church . On the average , the moral character demanded and the amount of pre-baptismal instruction required have been more exacting in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries than in any period since the third century . The knowledge of Jesus in the possession of converts , though meagre , has been greater than at any time since the infancy of the faith ? and possibly than in those supposedly halcyon days . This is not the place for even a summary description country by country of the new Christian communities . That would prolong these pages beyond any proper length . This must be said , however . In practically every land Christian communities have come into existence . In part because of the brief span of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century missionary movement ( less than a hundred and fifty years ) and of the relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , in few major areas are these young Christian groups more than a small minority of the popula-  | tion . In a few of the islands of the Pacific and here and there among primitive tribes of America , Asia , and Africa , a substantial minority , and even a majority , have become professedly Christian . In the larger masses of mankind the percentage ranges from about one-half of one per cent in Japan , about one per cent in China , between one and two per cent in India , to between four and five per cent in the Netherlands East Indies and to between seven and eight per cent in Negro Africa south of the Sahara . In contrast with earlier centuries , the mass conversion of entire peoples has been the exception . Christianity ? and so Jesus ? is represented by minorities . On the newer geographic frontiers , as in older Christendom , the contrast between the Church and its environment has been more sharply drawn than it has for centuries . While Christians have sought , and , considering the difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them according to the pattern of Jesus , the line between the followers of Jesus and the communities in which they are set has been less blurred than it has since the first three hundred years . It is not enough to know that the professed disciples of Jesus have grown enormously in numbers and in geographic spread in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . That , to be sure , is an indication of abounding vitality and evidence of continuing power in the impulse derived from Jesus . However , for any accurate appraisal of the effect of Jesus upon mankind during the past fourteen decades we must also inquire as to the quality of the impact of Christianity . Ilas this spread of Christianity brought mankind any nearer to the ideals of Jesus ? Have the standards of Jesus , apparently so impossible of full realization , been more nearly approximated by his followers ? Has the impulse from Jesus con-  | tributed to the curbing of some of the age-long evils which afflict the human race ? In degree as well as in geographic extent has the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries than in earlier ages ? First of all we must note the effect of Jesus not so much upon institutions and customs as upon individuals . It is impossible fully to separate the two , for individuals are affected by institutions and customs , and the latter , in turn , are created or moulded by individuals . To any who have extensive knowledge of the record of Christianity , however , it must be apparent that through Jesus in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries thousands of individuals have been put directly in touch with springs of power and that certain characteristic results have followed ? as they have through all the Christian centuries . Anyone with a wide acquaintance can name scores who by their Christian faith have been lifted out of mediocrity into lives of extraordinary beauty , who have discovered resources to meet suffering and disaster not only with fortitude but also with triumphant joy , and who in the midst of stress have found peace . For them their Christian faith has not meant retreat from the world or an opiate for life 's pains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens and under the load to learn self-detachment , equanimity , quiet courage , and resourcefulness . These transformed lives are not confined to any one nation or culture . In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries contact with the impulse from Jesus has nourished traits of character strikingly like those emanating from it in other centuries . The extensive missions of the period have demonstrated far more conclusively than ever that the power of the impulse from Jesus to produce these fruits is not limited by time , by race , or by environment . About Jesus is a uni-  | versality which is not constricted by chronology , by geography , or by culture . These may modify his influence , but they do not completely obscure it . Moreover , while those possessing these qualities are impossible of statistical enumeration , it seems incontestable that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries there have been more of them than in any other period of similar length . Next we must note those effects of Jesus which have been seen primarily in so-called Christendom , among the peoples who for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples looked upon their conversion as an event in the dim past , would they feel that they were outgrowing Christianity ? Would it seem to them an anachronism ? Would Jesus be a diminishing factor in their cultures ? At first sight the answer might appear to be an affirmative . Never among western and northern European peoples have so many openly repudiated or quietly ignored the Christian faith of their fathers . Yet further observation makes clear the fact that during the past fourteen decades in at least some respects Jesus has had more influence upon peoples who have traditionally been Christian than in any other period . Indeed , it is probable , although sufficiently exact measurements are not feasible , that never has Jesus so modified Occidental culture . Moreover , since through the expansion of Europe Occidental culture has been making itself felt the world around , in some of his effects on Christendom Jesus has also been touching non-Occidentals . One of the most spectacular of the effects of Jesus has been the termination of the traffic in negroes by the white races , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the British Empire and the United States . We have seen that never have members of one race been brought into servitude to another
