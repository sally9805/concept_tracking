It looked as if everybody wanted to go to the hospital at once . In New York City , Dr. J. B. Stiefel , medical director of the Associated Hospital Service , complained that people were taking to hospital beds for colds , ingrown toenails , or simply to get a good night 's sleep . Most of the 6,511 U.S. hospitals ( not counting Army , Navy and Veterans Administration hospitals ) had waiting lists . <P> Surveying 18 cities , the Modern Hospital reported overcrowding so bad that " beds scarcely have time to cool off between patients . " <P> But last week harassed hospital staffs had good news : President Truman signed a bill committing the Government to spend $75,000,000 a year for the next five years to build hospitals . Aid will be apportioned among states according to need , must be matched 2-to-1 by local contributions . Total program : $1,125,000,000 . <P> Doctors attribute current hospital overcrowding mainly to 1 ) an 8,000,000 increase in U.S. population since 1939 , 2 ) a great boom in hospital insurance plans ( nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more &; more diseases and delivering more &; more babies in a hospital instead of at home . The biggest demand for hospital care is in cities . But the new building program will not be conducted on the principle that the squeaking axle gets the most grease . A major share of the federal funds will be used to build small hospitals and health centers in rural areas , since 40% of U.S. counties have no registered hospitals . <P> Hospital men think the minimum should be 4.5 beds for each 1,000 of population . Only a handful of states ( e.g. , New York , Massachusetts , Delaware , District of Columbia ) have that many now ; the nation 's average is 3.5 . To bring the whole U.S. up to standard will require adding 165,000 new beds in general hospitals , 60,000 in tuberculosis hospitals , 115,000 for mental and nervous patients ( present total : 1,738,944 ) . <P> But building new hospitals is only a start . The biggest problem will be to staff them ; there are not nearly enough nurses . U.S. hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no idea where they will get them .
