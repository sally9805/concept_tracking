The corner of Alaska nearest Siberia was probably man 's first threshold to the Western Hemisphere . So for years archeologists have dug there for a clue to America 's prehistoric past . Until last year , all the finds were obviously Eskimo . Then Anthropologists Froelich G. Rainey of the University of Alaska and two collaborators struck the remains of a town , of inciedible size and mysterious culture . Last week in Natural History Professor Rainey , still somewhat amazed , described this lost Arctic city . <P> It lies at Ipiutak on Point Hope , a bleak sandspit in the Arctic Ocean , where no trees and little grass survive endless gales at 30 below zero . But where houses lay more than 2,000 years ago , underlying refuse makes grass and moss grow greener . The scientists could easily discern traces of long avenues and hundreds of dwelling sites . A mile long , a quarter-mile wide , this ruined city was perhaps as big as any in Alaska today ( biggest : Juneau , pop . 5,700 ) . <P> On the Arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch scarcely enough seals , whales , caribou to live on . What these ancient Alaskans ate is all the more puzzling because they seem to have lacked such Arctic weapons as the Eskimo harpoon . <P> Yet they had enough leisure to make many purely artistic objects , some of no recognizable use . Their carvings are vaguely akin to Eskimo work but so sophisticated and elaborate as to indicate a relation with some centre of advanced culture - perhaps Japan or southern Siberia - certainly older than the Aztec or Mayan . <P> In the ancient graves the scientists found more than in the ruined houses . Some skulls contain large ivory eyeballs inlaid with jet pupils ( see cut , p. 59 ) . Birdlike ivory beaks were substituted for the corpse 's nose . Who were these people ? How did they manage to live ? Whence did they come , whither did they go ? Says Professor Rainey : " We , as archeologists , have a difficult problem to explain the Ipiutak culture .
