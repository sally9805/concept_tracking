The Man Who Walked Through Walls A Story by Marcel Aym6 Translated by E. and M. Teichner and Illustrated by Adolf Hallman I N MONTMARTRE , on the third floor of 75A Rue d'Orchampt , there lived a good man by the name of Dutilleul who was gifted with the singular ability to walk through walls , without being inconvenienced in any way . He wore a pince-nez and a small black goatee , and worked as a clerk at the Ministry of Registration . In winter he went to the office by bus , and when the weather was kinder , he walked the distance under his derby . Dutilleul had just turned forty-three when this power was revealed to him . Caught one evening , by a brief electrical breakdown , in the foyer of his small bachelor apartment , he groped about for a moment in the darkness . When the current was restored , he found himself on the third floor landing . The fact that his front door was locked on the inside made him pause and reflect . Reason notwithstanding , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight through the wall . This strange faculty , apparently gratifying none of his aspirations , was a source of annoyance , and , as the next day was Saturday , he took advantage of the five-day week to . visit a neighborhood doctor and explain his troubles . The doctor ascertained for himself the truth of Dutilleul 's story , and after a thorough examination , discovered the cause of the affliction in a hardening of the helix of the strangulary wall of the thyroid . He prescribed a very active life and pills compounded of pirete powder ( tetravalent ) , rice flour , and centaur hormones , taken twice a year . Dutilleul swallowed the first pill , put the medicine away in a drawer , and thought no more of the matter . As for living a very active life , his bureaucratic existence , bound by routine , precluded excesses of any kind . Nor did his leisure-time occupations oblige him to any unreasonable expenditure of energy , taken up , as it was , with the reading of the daily paper , and his stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had kept intact his faculty to pass through walls , without putting it to any use . This was not by way of inadvertence , but , rather , because of a lack of curiosity and a mulish resistance to the force of his imagination . It never even occurred to him that he might enter his rooms by any means other than the front door , after duly turning the lock . He might have aged in the peace of his daily routine , without being tempted to put his gifts to the test , had not this existence been suddenly turned upside-down by a disconcerting event . 1 is immediate superior at the Ministry of Registration , M. Mouron , was called to other duties , and was replaced by a certain M. Lecuyer , a man of few words and a clipped mustache . From the first day his new boss looked askance at Dutilleul 's pince-nez hanging on a chain , and his black goatee . Lecuyer treated him like an old and slightly unclean nuisance . But what was most serious was that the newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his subordinate . For twenty years Dutilleul had begun his letters with the following formula : " Referring to your esteemed letter of such and such date , and for your knowledge , to our previous correspondence , I have the honor to inform you . . . . " For this , M. Lecuyer wished to substitute another introduction with a more American turn of phrase : " In response to your letter of such and such date , I wish to inform you .... " DutilleuI was incapable of adapting himself to these epistolary fashions . Despite himself , he returned to the traditional mode of address , and the mechanical obstinacy with which he accomplished this gained him the growing enmity of his superior . The atmosphere of the Ministry of Registration seemed almost oppressive . In the mornings he set off to work with apprehension , and in the evenings , in his bed , he often meditated for a whole quarter-hour before falling off to sleep . Disgusted by this negative attitude which compromised the success of his reforms , M. Lecuyer had relegated Dutilleul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by a low , narrow door , opening on the corridor . It still bore in capital letters the inscription : STOREROOM . Dutilleul resigned himself to this unprecedented humiliation , but once at home , while reading in his paper the story of some bloody incident , he caught himself dreaming of M. Lecuyer as the victim . One day his superior burst into the cell brandishing a letter , and began to bellow : " Do this damn thing over ! This stupid nonsense which dishonors my department ! " Dutilleul tried to object , but M. Lecuyer treated him like a low order of cockroach , and before leaving , crushed the letter and threw it in his face . For all his diffidence , Dutilleul was a man of spirit . Left alonein his little office , his temperature rose , and suddenly he felt himself inspired . He got up from his chair and entered the wall that separated the two offices . But he entered prudently , so that only his head emerged on the other side . M. Lecuyer was seated at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text of some underling , when he heard a cough in the office . Raising his eyes , he discovered , with indescribable panic , Dutilleul 's head , stuck on the wall like a hunting trophy . And this head was alive . Through the pince-nez , it pierced him with a look of hatred . Better still , the head spoke . " Sir , " it said , " you are a cad , a scoundrel , and a knave . " Agape with horror , M. Lecuyer was incapable of taking his eyes off this apparition . Finally , he tore himself from his armchair , rushed into the corridor , and ran into the storeroom . Dutilleul , pen in hand , was seated at his usual place in a peaceful and hard-working pose . His superior scrutinized him carefully and at length , mumbled a few words , and returned to his office . Hardly had he seated himself , when the head reappeared on the wall . " Sir , you are a cad , a scoundrel , and a knave . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the wall twenty-three times , and it reappeared as often in the days that followed . Dutilleul had acquired a certain ease at this game , and no longer restricted himself to invective directed at his superior . He uttered vague threats ; for instance , he declaimed , in a sepulchral voice , punctuated with truly demoniacal laughs , a nursery rhyme which began with the words , " Garoul Garoul " and conveyed a sense of overpowering menace . Hearing this , poor M. Lecuyer paled still further , gasped a little more than usual ; his hair stood straight up on end , and a horrible sweat of agony flowed down his back . The first day he lost a pound . In the week following , aside from melting away almost to the point of transparency , he took to drinking his soup with a fork and saluting policemen . At the beginning of the second week , an ambulance came to his door and took him away to an asylum . Rid of M. Lecuyer 's tyranny , Dutilleul was able to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter of such and such date . . . " Nonetheless , he was dissatisfied . Something inside clamored , a new and imperious need , which was nothing less than the urge to go through walls . Undoubtedly , he did not lack of facilities . At home , for instance , he indulged himself . But the man who possesses such brilliant gifts is not long content to exercise them on such mediocre objects . Besides , going through walls can not be considered an end in itself . It is the beginning of an adventure that provokes a sequence , a development , and , inexorably , a retribution . This Dutilleul understood well . He felt a need for expansion , a growing desire to fulfill and outdo himself , and a kind of nostalgia , which appeared to be something like the call from beyond the wall . Unfortunately , he lacked a goal . He sought inspiration in the newspaper , particularly in the political and sports sections . These seemed like honorable pursuits , but he finally decided that they offeredno outlet to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one field that showed promise . D UTILLEUL 'S first burglary took place in a large banking establishment in the financial district . Having gone through a dozen or so walls and partitions , he entered several vaults , and filled his pockets with banknotes . Before leaving , he autographed his crime , under the pseudonym Garou-Garou , with an extremely elaborate flourish that was reproduced in all the newspapers the next day . By the end of a week , the name Garou-Garou had attained an extraordinary fame . The public gave its sympathy without reservation to this wonder-working thief who so mystified the police . Every night he made his presence known by some new exploit , at the expense of a bank , a jewelry store , or some wealthy person . There was no dreamy-eyed woman , whether in Paris or in the provinces , who did not desire ardently to belong body and soul to the terrible Garou-Garou . After the lifting of the Burdigala diamond , and the looting of the Municipal Bank , both in the space of a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior was forced to resign , and in his fall pulled along the Minister of Registration . While all this was transpiring , Dutilleul , now one of the wealthiest men in Paris , was always punctually at his office . He was even spoken of for academic palms . His pleasure , in the mornings , was to listen to his colleagues ' comments on his exploits of the previous night . " A genius , this Garou-Garou , " they said , " a remarkable man , a superman . " Hearing such praise . Dutilleul blushed with confusion , and under his pince-nez , his eyes shone with friendship and gratitude . One day this sympathetic atmosphere put him in such an expansive mood that he felt no longer capable of keeping the secret to himself . The remnants of a shy personality made him first apprise his colleagues , clustered about a newspaper telling about the robbery of the Bank of France . He said in a modest voice : " You know . ibis Garou  --  Garou , that 's me . " An enormous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of scorn , was nicknamed Garou-Garou . At quitting-time , in the evening , he was the butt of endless scoffing from his comrades . Life seemed less beautiful . Some days later , Garou-Garou had himself nabbed by a night patrolman in a jewelry store on the Rue de la Paix . He had inscribed his signature on the cash register and was singing a drinking song , while shattering show-cases with a massive gold goblet . It would have been simple to bury himself in a wall , and thus to escape the patrolman , but everything leads one to believe that he wanted to be arrested , probably with the sole aim of confounding his colleagues , whose skepticism had been so mortifying . And indeed , Dutilleul 's photograph on the front pages of the papers the following day caused great surprise amongst them . They regretted bitterly having so misjudged their genial comrade , and rendered homage to him by growing goatees . Led on by a combination of remorse and admiration , some of them even tried to snatch the billfolds and watches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed himself to be captured by the police in order to astound a few colleagues , will be taken as evidence of a frivolous turn of mind , unworthy of so exceptional a man . But such temptation overwhelms the will . In renouncing his liberty , Dutilleul thought he was merely yielding to an arrogant desire for revenge , while , in fact , he was really accomplishing his destiny . For a man who can go through walls , no audacious career is complete if he has not , at least once , been imprisoned . D uTELLEuL felt that he was being spoiled by fortune as soon as he entered the premises of the Sante . The thickness of the walls was a real treat . On the second day of his imprisonment , the guards were stupefied to discover that the prisoner had hammered a nail into his wall , and had hung thereupon a gold watch belonging to the warden . The prisoner was either unwilling or unable to tell how the object had come into his possession . The watch was returned to its owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Garou-Garou 's cot , alongside a copy of the first volume of The Three Musketeers , borrowed from the warden 's bookshelves . The staff of the Sante was on edge . Besides , the guards complained of being kicked in the rear by an unknown agency . The walls seemed to have sprouted feet , as well as ears . Garou-Garou had been imprisoned at the Sante for a week when the warden , one morning , was greeted by a letter on his desk : My dear Warden : Referring to our talk of the 17th inst. , and for your reminder , to your overall instructions of the 15th of May of last year , I have the honor to inform you that I have just finished the second volume of The Three Musketeers , and that I plan to escape tonight , between 11:25 and 11:35 . I beg of you , my dear sir , to accept the expression of my profound respect . Garou-Garou . Despite the strict surveillance under which he was placed , Dutilleul escaped at 11:30 . This news , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meanwhile , having brought off a new robbery , which capped his popularity , Dutilleul appeared unconcerned about hiding , and circulated freely in Montmartre . He was arrested three days after his escape at the Cafe du R  --  ve , Rue Caulaincourt , a little after midday , while drinking a glass of white wine and lemon with some friends . Returned to the Sante , and imprisoned under triple lock in solitary confinement , he escaped that very night , and went to sleep in the guest room of the warden 's apartment . The next morning , just before nine , he rang for the maid to bring his breakfast , and allowed himself to be plucked , without resistance , from the bed by the alerted guards . Incensed , the warden established a guard post at the door of his cell , and put him on a diet of dry bread and water . At noon , the prisoner went to eat in a nearby restaurant , and , after drinking his coffee , phoned the warden : " Hello , Warden ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when leaving , I forgot to take your wallet , and now I 'm stuck at a restaurant . Would you he so kind as to send someone to pay the bill ? " The warden rushed over in person , and lost his temper to the point of threatening and cursing . His pride touched , Dutilleul escaped the following night , never to return . This time , he took the precaution of shaving offhis black goatee , and replaced his pince-nez glasses with a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles . A sports cap and a loud checked suit , with plus-fours , completed the transformation . He set himself up in a small apartment on the Avenue Junot , where , before his first arrest , he had sent part of his furniture and his most treasured possessions . The tumult and fame surrounding his name had become tedious , and since staying at the Sante , his enthusiasm for going through walls had become jaded . The most massive and pretentious now seemed mere screens , and he dreamed of penetrating to the heart of some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking form , he led a most uneventful existence , dividing his time between motion pictures , his stamp collection , and long strolls about Montmartre . So complete was the metamorphosis that , with shaven face and horn-rimmed glasses , he brushed against his best friends on the street without being recognized . Only the painter Gen Paul , observant of the slightest changes in the physiognomy of old Montmartre residents , penetrated his disguise . One morning , finding himself face to face with Dutilleul , at the corner of the Rue de 1'Abreuvoir , he could not refrain from saying in his vulgar way : " I see you got yourself rigged up like a plush duck to dodge the cops . " - Ah ! " murmured Dutilleul , " you recognize me . " He was worried and decided to hasten his departure for Egypt . But on the afternoon of that very day , he fell in love with a blonde beauty whom he saw twice in the space of a quarter hour on the Rue Lepic . All thoughts of stamps , Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , the blonde looked him over with considerable interest . Nothing strikes the fancy of modern young ladies like a loud checked suit and horn-rimmed spectacles . They see stardom , and dream of cocktails and California nights . Unfortunately , so Gen Paul informed Dutilleul , the beauty was married to a brutal and jealous husband . Besides , this suspicious spouse led a life of pleasure and license . Regularly , he deserted his wife between ten in the evening and four in the morning , but , before leaving , he took the precaution of locking her in her room and barring the windows . In the daytime , too , he maintained this strict supervision , even following her through the streets of Montinartre . " The old rascal 's always on the watch , " said Gen Paul . " He wo n't stand for any muscling in on his territory . " But Gen Paul 's warning served only to inflame Dutilleul . The next day , running across the young woman in the Rue Tholoze , he ventured to follow her into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutilleul declared his respectful passion , adding that he knew everything  --  the wicked husband , the locked and barred room  --  hut that he would visit her that very night . The blonde blushed , the milk pitcher trembled in her hand , and her eyes became dewy with tenderness . She sighed weakly and said : " Alas , Monsieur , that is impossible . " A T TEN O'CLOCK in the evening of that joyful day Dutilleul was on duty at the Rue Norvins , inspecting a robust garden wall . Behind it stood a small house , of which only the chimney and weather vane were visible . A door opened in the wall , and a man after carefully locking it behind him , set out down the hill toward the Avenue J unot . Dutilleul waited until he had disappeared from view , turning a corner at some distance , and counted to ten . Then he jumped like a gymnast into the wall , and goingthrough all subsequent obstacles , finally entered the room of the beautiful recluse . She greeted him rapturously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following day , Dutilleul had the misfortune to suffer severe headaches . He judged the matter to be of little importance , and did not intend , because of it , to miss his rendezvous . Nevertheless , by chance discovering a few scattered pills at the bottom of a drawer , he swallowed one in the morning , and another in the afternoon . By evening , the pains were tolerable , and they were forgotten in his exaltation . The young woman awaited him with an impatience rekindled by the memory of the previous night , and they made love until three in the morning . After leaving , while going through the partitions and walls of the house , Dutilleul had the impression of an unaccustomed friction about the hips and shoulders . However , he did not at first give it much attention . Be sides , it was only in penetrating the garden wall that he had the clear sensation of resistance . He felt that he was moving in a still fluid medium , but one that was coagulating rapidly with each of his movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness of the wall , he noticed that he could not advance further , and remembered with horror the two pills he had taken during the day . He had thought them aspirins , but , in reality , they were the tetravalent pirete powders the doctor had prescribed the previous year . The effect of this medication , on top of a very active existence , manifested itself suddenly . Dutilleul was , as it were , congealed in the interior of the wall . He is still there , solidly ensconced . The evening strollers who walk down the Rue Norvins when the rumble of Paris has abated , hear a muffled voice that appears to come from beyond the grave . They take it to be the wind whistling through the square at the Butte Montmartre . It is GarouGarou , who laments the end of his glorious career , and regrets his love cut short . Some winter evenings , the painter Gen Paul takes his guitar down from the wall , and in the sonorous solitude , wanders down the Rue Norvins in order to console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winging from his numbed fingers , penetrate to the heart of the stone like drops of moonlight .
