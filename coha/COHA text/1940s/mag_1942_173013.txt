The R.A.F. put on a full-dress , day- &night; offensive last week which the British tried to persuade the world was 1 ) bigger than the Battle of Britain , 2 ) a second front against Hitler . It was neither - but it was pretty good , much better than anything the R.A.F. had ever dared before . <P> In numbers which correspondents computed by hundreds , the R.A.F. swept by day and swatted by night . Italy 's faraway golden triangle - Turin , Milan , Genoa-was bombed nonstop from England . Augsburg in Bavaria , another distant target , was bombed daringly by day . The Ruhr got it two nights . Hamburg was pasted . But the real noise and numbers were the daylight sweeps along the French coast and the invasion ports-Lorient , Le Havre , St. Nazaire , Cherbourg , Dunkirk , Calais , Rouen , carried out mainly by Spitfire-protected Hurricanes , converted to carry light bombs and nicknamed Hurribombers . One day more than 400 planes went over ; the next , 600 went . <P> A U.S. correspondent cabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes are taking a notable part , is larger and more sustained than when the Battle of Britain was at its height in August and September 1940 . " Colin Bednall of the London Daily Mail computed that 250-350 tons a night were being dropped on the Reich , which compared favorably with the Luftwaffe 's droppings over London : on only two occasions were the Germans estimated to have dropped as much as 400 tons a night . <P> But there were two big differences between the R.A.F. offensive and the Battle of Britain . First the Germans in 1940 concentrated hundreds of planes on a single target in each raid , whereas the British last week fanned out and pecked at scattered targets with relatively small forces of planes on each . And second , the major R.A.F. effort was thrown into sweeps intended to harass the Germans along the invasion coast rather than to cut to the heart of the German war effort . <P> To make the R.A.F. offensive seem a second front , the Air Ministry issued a communiqu estimating that 1,500,000 Germans were being kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed : " In addition , half of the entire fighter strength of the Luftwaffe is kept away from the Russian front to meet the R.A.F. 's attacks . " Neither the figure nor the claim bore examination . The Air Ministry , in fact , listed only 20,000 combatants in a breakdown of its 1,500,000 total . The Times claim did not fit very neatly with the R.A.F. announcement that on the day 400 planes went over France , only five German planes were shot down ; on the day 600 went , only two were shot down . <P> Not by such victories will Adolf Hitler be defeated in 1942 . But he may well be defeated by the spirit which motivated them .
