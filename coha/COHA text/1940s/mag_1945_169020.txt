At President Roosevelt 's ear the White House telephone twanged and squeaked while Florida 's zealously New Dealing Claude Pepper spluttered at the wire 's other end . Said Pepper in effect : the Roosevelt State Department choices were too conservative for an earnest New Dealer to endorse . The President replied : if the Senate does not endorse this list , it will be sent back unchanged to the next session . <P> He added , soothingly : Claude , you ought to have seen the first list submitted to me . <P> Temporarily mollified , Pepper called off his threatened filibuster . The Senate hastily confirmed Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius ' team , and went home . But New Deal Congressmen still had reservations about three , in particular , of the six appointees : William L. Clayton , whom they consider a " cartelist " ; Brigadier General Julius C. Holmes , whom they partly blame for the Darlan policy in 1942 ; veteran Diplomat James Dunn , whom they regard as the villain of the U.S. appeasement policy toward Franco . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henceforth any Rooseveltian swings to the right would be fought loudly and bitterly by men who are normally his most loyal wish-followers in Congress . These include Pennsylvania 's noisy Joe Guffey and Montana 's wealthy , leftist James E. Murray . They also count on support from Utah 's Elbert D. Thomas and Alabama 's Lister Hill , as well as two freshman Senators-Warren Magnuson of Washington and Brien McMahon of Connecticut . Somewhere in the background was the ambitious C.I.O. Political Action Committee . Even further back was the man the C.I.O. has picked as a potential leader of the junta and a potential 1948 Presidential candidate : Henry Wallace . <P> So far the coalition was loosely formed . But it recognized two political facts of life : Franklin Roosevelt needed pressure from the left to stay " a little left of center " ; and this was presumably the President 's last term in office . From their first skirmish and hasty retreat , they claimed a partial victory : a Roosevelt promise to " consult " them next time .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
