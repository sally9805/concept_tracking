THE RED PRUSSIAN , THE LIFE &; LEGEND OF KARL MARX ( 422 pp. ) - eopold Schwarzschlld-Scribner ( $4 ) . <P> " If a name had to be found for the age in which we live , " says the author of this book , " we might safely call it the Marxian era . For , in one way or another , the most important facts of our time lead back to one man-Karl Marx . " <P> Biographer Schwarzschild is no admirer of Marx or Marxism . He is pointing to the fact that since World War I no other mind has so potently influenced the political and economic thinking and action of our times . There are masses of unconscious Marxists-men &; women who have never read Marx 's Capital , and who would rather be found dead than reading the Communist Manifesto , but whose thinking about the role of economic forces in history , the responsibility of government for the individual , and the importance of economic security v. political freedom has nevertheless been profoundly influenced by the choleric expatriate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own weapons have inevitably taken a Marxist turn . Both Naziism and Fascism , Biographer Schwarzschild points out , are Marxist mutations whose predestined political form is therefore the police state . In Nazi concentration camps , as in Russian forced-labor camps , Karl Marx was the presiding genius . In the name of human progress , Marx has probably caused more death , misery , degradation and despair than any man who ever lived . <P> Complacent &; Patronizing . For a mind whose consequences have been so monstrous , this biography is singularly debonair . It is certainly the most readable life of Marx available . For those who wish to see so alarming a monster debunked , it is a complacent job of debunking . Nor need readers fear exposure to the rigors of Marxist political theory or economics . Biographer Schwarzschild lightly writes off those arid involutions . <P> Schwarzschild 's indictment is most effective when describing Marx 's personal and political life from 1818 to 1883 . Here is Marx the boy taken to a church in Trier , in the recently Prussianized Rhineland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer in an interminable line of distinguished rabbis , admired Prussia and its official religion . Here is Marx the future socialist , unsocially shunning his school fellows while his mental acrobatics charm Ludwig von Westphalen , a much older man of a much higher social position . Marx later repaid Westphalen for this early interest by marrying his daughter , Jenny , against the wishes of her family . And here is Marx the frustrated poet , wasting his time , and his father 's ( and later his widowed mother 's ) slim resources as a shiftless college student . Marx finally received a kind of mail-order degree from the University of Jena . <P> Boring from Within . Marx got his start in life as editor of the Rhenish Gazette . This newspaper had been founded by a group of solid businessmen turned publishers . Like other publishers since , they were presently bewildered to discover that their paper had been infiltrated by socialists and was being used as a mouthpiece for revolutionary ideas . Marx lost his job . Then began his lifelong career as an expatriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
