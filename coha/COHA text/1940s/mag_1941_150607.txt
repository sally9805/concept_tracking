Inspired by tales of women helping to defend Russia , Mrs. Edward Frederick Boultbee , the wife of an air-raid warden in the village of Attleborough , Norfolk , last week edged up to an " invading " tank in British Army maneuvers , popped a rock into the open turret . <P> " You 're dead ! " she cried . " That was a bomb . " <P> The tank commander said icily : " Madam , I 'm not fighting women . " <P> Said she : " Well , I 'm fighting invaders . " <P> The nearest umpire was summoned . He ruled the tank destroyed .
