Robin Hood 's Bay , on the rocky Yorkshire coast , is an old fishing village isolated by sea and moor . Picturesque houses climb crazily up a steep cliff . Saint Stephen 's Church , at the top of the cliff , is one of the centers of community life for most of the 800 villagers . There they go for a crowded weekly calendar of services , whist drives , community sings , jumble ( rummage ) sales and church dances . There , since 1944 , tall , sturdy Rev. Arthur Patrick has presided over his flock . Until last month , few in Robin Hood 's Bay knew what a blight had been eating away at that flock for the past 20 years . <P> Spring Cleaning . It began in 1928 with a series of anonymous letters attacking the vicar , then Canon Desmond Lloyd Wilson , for shooting at birds . Within a few months the letters had driven him from Robin Hood 's Bay . His successor , too , resigned under a barrage of anonymous scurrility . One later incumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , without his knowledge , intercepted anonymous letters which arrived for him each week . <P> Parson Patrick received his first just after he had given the church a spring cleaning . " Now that you have cleaned the church , " it read , " would you clean the damned filthy rotten minds of your congregation ? " Patrick listened among his parishioners , soon learned that he was not the only target of the poison penman . One woman came to him and threatened to throw herself off the cliff if she got another insulting letter . A respected old villager was accused of fathering his own daughter 's child . A heartbroken mother , whose baby had just died , was accused of killing the baby herself . Some thought the letters must come from a member of the church choir : caustic remarks about their singing regularly arrived for the choristers . Sample : " If you must sing , get some bird seed . " <P> For the Best . In the tight little community , such malicious letters set people to watching their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of a retired sea captain , got a letter asking if she knew that her daughters " kept open house " for local men . " I stayed home from church for months . After all , I was n't sure whether the culprit was sitting in the next pew . " The apparent basis for the letter to Mrs. Streatin was the fact that her daughters had given an innocent party for other villagers . <P> Parson Patrick decided to bring the secret suffering into the open . One Sunday last month , when the time came to start his sermon , he told the worshipers : " Today you 'll have a treat . I 'll read you a sermon sent to me in the form of a letter . Some of your names are mentioned in it , but ... it 's all for the best . " <P> Read Them &; Laugh . The letter read : " Do n't you think it is about time you gave a sermon to your flock about the disgraceful scandal mongering and backbiting by members of your church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good word for anybody who does not fall with her . She should remember that she is ... at best only a washerwoman and not too clean at that . She thinks she and her poor half-witted man own the church . . . . You poor mutt . . . . You and your wife are a bright couple of spiving gluttons. "
