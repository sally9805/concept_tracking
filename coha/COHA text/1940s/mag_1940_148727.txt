One day last week 10,000 Southerners poured into the little town of Jefferson in northern Georgia . Most of them went to see Postmaster General Jim Farley , posting through the South on one of his periodic junkets ( see p. 15 ) . Officially , they went to honor Jefferson 's Crawford Williamson Long , first doctor to operate under ether , 98 years ago . At noon , on the village square , the Postmaster General sold a sheaf of new two-cent stamps , bearing the bearded countenance of Dr. Long , to the only survivor of his twelve children-his aged daughter , Mrs. Eugenia Long Harper . <P> The high-school band blared , and Postmaster Farley added his two cents ' worth about " the red hills of Georgia and her noble sons . " <P> In medical circles up North , there was much grumbling about the Long stamp . <P> Most doctors believe , with their sainted masters , Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes , * Sir William Osier and Dr. William H. Welch , that the real originator of anesthesia was Dentist William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From San Francisco last week Dr. Morton 's daughter-in-law , Mrs. Bowditch Morton , filed her filial protest . " It 's a strange thing , " said she , " that Farley did n't consult with the U. S. Public Health Service . He wants to curry favor with the South during an election year . " <P> Thus aired again was an ancient medical controversy which had resulted in starvation for one scientist , insanity for a second , suicide for a third . <P> In the early 19th Century , shortly after chemists discovered ether and nitrous oxide ( laughing gas ) , some medical students went on jags , taking a few whiffs of one drug or the other until half-conscious and happily drunk . In the early 1840s , ' dashing young Dr. Long sniffed ether at parties , but was clear-headed enough to notice that his drunken friends , if they came to blows , felt no pain . So one day in 1842 , he fearfully soaked a towel in ether , anesthetized a friend before removing a tumor . <P> Delighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients . But gradually the word spread around that he was a sorcerer , and he was forced to give up anesthesia . Too modest to publish his early experiments until many years later , he laid his ether bottles aside . <P> Meantime , moon-faced Horace Wells , a dentist of Hartford , Conn. , successfully tried laughing gas on himself before a colleague pulled his tooth . Dazzled with hopes of a fortune , he tried the wonder gas on half-a-dozen patients , then dashed off to Massachusetts General Hospital to demonstrate it . But at the hospital the gas did n't work , and he was hooted out . <P> Then a patient died under anesthesia , and Wells turned to selling art reproductions and portable showerbaths . After brooding over his failure for five years , he finally went crazy , was arrested for dashing acid into the face of a streetwalker . In jail he slashed the femoral artery of his leg . After Wells died , nitrous oxide anesthesia was forgotten until 1900.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
