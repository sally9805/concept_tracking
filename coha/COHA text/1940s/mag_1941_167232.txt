Two of his four partners in United Artists , Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ( who died a few months later ) were no longer making films . Charlie Chaplin brooded on his art , once in a long while turned out a picture . Producer Goldwyn felt that his films were carrying United Artists , had tried in vain ( with British Producer Alexander Korda ) to acquire the rest of its stock . <P> Fortnight ago in Hollywood the case was finally settled out of court . Released from his contract was Producer Goldwyn . United Artists arranged to buy in his stock for a rumored $300,000 .
