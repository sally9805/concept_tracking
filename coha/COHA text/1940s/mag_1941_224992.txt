Only dishonest people have anything to fear from racketeers . This was long a maxim of New York City 's Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine . <P> Last week , in a New York Federal court , Movieman Nicholas M. Schenck 's whole attitude testified that the Commissioner did not know what he was talking about . Mr. Schenck , it appeared , had been an innocent , bleeding lamb in the hands of a pair of high priests of racketeering . <P> Mr. Schenck was first witness in the Government 's case against George E. Browne , an A.F. of L. vice president* and head of the stagehands ' union , and Willie Bioff , the union 's West Coast representative . Browne and Bioff are charged with extorting $550,000 from four major movie companies , including Loew 's Inc. , of which Mr. Schenck is president . <P> Schenck 's sad story : <P> His troubles began in 1935 , when projectionists in Browne 's union threatened to strike 60-odd theaters in New York City . Just to keep the peace , Schenck coughed up $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike in Chicago showed Schenck what he might be in for there . About a year later , Browne introduced him to smiling Willie Bioff ( who had once been in the prostitution business in Chicago ) . <P> As Schenck recalled the meeting , Bioff said : " Now look , I 'll tell you why I 'm here . I want you to know that I 'm the boss-I elected Mr. Browne-and I want from the movie industry $2,000,000 . " When the astounded Schenck began to protest , Bioff warned him : " Stop this nonsense . It will cost you a lot more if you do n't do it . " The conversation , said Mr. Schenck , was " outstanding . . . terrible . " <P> Two days later another meeting took place . According to Schenck , Bioff took him aside and confided : " Maybe $2,000,000 is a little too much . ... I decided I 'll take a million . " In the end , Schenck agreed that Bioff should get $50,000 a year from him and each movie company , $25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took a little bundle containing $50,000 in large bills to the Waldorf-Astoria , dropped it on a bed and looked out a window . Sidney R. Kent , president of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. , came in and dropped a little bundle too . Bioff and Browne , said Schenck , picked the bundles up , counted the money . A year later , Schenck said , Bioff called again . Lamblike Mr. Schenck got another bundle , handed it over to Bioff and Browne without a bleat . <P> <P> * As the A.F. of L. convention droned on last week in Seattle , the embarrassed executive council got ready to rid itself of Browne by reducing the number of vice presidencies . This does not mean that Browne would cease to be head of his own autonomous union .
