When brisk , brash Larry MacPhail took over the New York Yankees last winter , newshawks asked : " How will McCarthy feel ? " Last week Joe McCarthy felt sick . <P> Chubby , jut-jawed Joe McCarthy 's 14-year record with the Yankees is a manager 's daydream . " Just let me worry about the club " is one of his favorite remarks , and he has worried his well-heeled , star-studded club to eight American League pennants , seven world championships . This year , although they have stayed within shooting distance of the league-leading Detroit Tigers , the Yankees have generally looked like also-rans . <P> Larry MacPhail , who is also a worrier , found it hard to take . Finally , as everyone felt sure he would , he emerged from his lowering cloud of silence and publicly castigated the Yankees . Along with some dark threats about overpaid players , he charged : " It is one thing to be beaten and quite another to be outhustled . . . . We must have more life , more pepper . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism had ever come from the front office during the serene reign of Manager McCarthy ( ex-Boss Ed Barrow never strayed that near the base paths ) . Shortly , gregarious Joe McCarthy found himself suffering from " a nervous condition . " After steering clear of the stadium for a few days , he offered his resignation . <P> Hastily absolving McCarthy of all blame for the Yankees ' failures , MacPhail refused to accept the resignation . He suggested instead that Joe go home for a rest . The 58-year-old manager , who has suffered from a gall bladder ailment and who could certainly afford to retire if he felt like it ( total earnings with the Yankees : some $500,000 ) , shuffled off to Buffalo to think things out. * <P> Although both the manager and his boss denied any disagreement about how baseball should be played , many dopesters thought differently . Mindful that big-league baseball is bush-league by prewar standards , McCarthy had strongly defended his men : " I say the players are giving everything they have . You ca n't expect them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in their physical make-up . " <P> On to Chicago . But Larry MacPhail , who excludes the word " impossible " from his bulging vocabulary , had already decided to shake up his slumping club . Last week , neatly finessing waiver difficulties , he sold high-paid ( $17,500 a year ) Pitcher Hank Borowy ( won 10 , lost 5 ) to the National League-leading Chicago Cubs. + <P> Borowy , who promptly won his first start for the Cubs , might well nail down the pennant for them . In return MacPhail said that the Yankees would get unnamed players worth $100,000 , or their cash equivalent . He added : " This is the first step in the general plan for rebuilding that Manager McCarthy and I have agreed upon . . . . " <P> <P> *Guessing that McCarthy might be through , New York sportswriters began nominating possible successors : Yankee Coach Art Fletcher ( unlikely ) , Manager Leo Durocher , of the Dodgers ( possible ) and ex-Yankee Lieut .
