Visitors at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art last week sat and lounged all over exhibits and pushed them around with impunity . The visitors enjoyed it because they spent as much time on their rumps as on their feet . The museum did not mind because it was doing its best to boost modern furniture out of the fad stage . <P> Holding a hemisphere-wide competition for furniture , lamps and textiles of " Organic Design , " the Museum had agreed not only to exhibit its prize-winning entries , but to sponsor their manufacture and distribution . To do this , the Museum had set factory wheels humming and enlisted the help of twelve U.S. department stores* who stocked their furniture floors with duplicate exhibitions and invited the public to buy as well as look . <P> To conservative furniture-fanciers , the Museum of Modern Art 's display looked about as homelike as the waiting room of an up-to-date airport . Tea wagons that looked like bathroom fixtures shared honors with kidney-shaped coffee tables and tubular steel reclining mechanisms . Most of the weird-looking gadgetry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> To dramatize the exhibition , the Museum 's directors illustrated the history of furniture design with a series of models and photographs , beginning with furniture 's first move toward modern functionalism : the ugly old-fashioned " Morris chair " designed in the 1870s for British art-crafter William Morris , in a mistaken attempt to defy the Machine Age . The historical survey moved onward with examples of tubular steel sitting machines by German Bauhausler Marcel Breuer and French Architect Le Corbusier , to the light , cardboardy modern plywood seats and tables by Finland 's Alvar Aalto . <P> Climax of this historical build-up was a horrible example : the dismembered body of a comfortable old-fashioned overstuffed easy chair which lay behind the bars of a big animal cage under a life-size photograph of Gorilla Gargantua . Said an accompanying placard : " Cathedra gargantua , genus americanus . Weight when fully matured , 60 pounds . Habitat , the American Home . Devours little children , pencils , small change , fountain pens , bracelets , clips , earrings , scissors , hairpins , and other small flora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinct . " <P> Best-looking entries in the show were a group of splashily printed fabrics , done with the silk-screen process by Czechoslovak Architect Antonin Raymond . Most practical furniture was a set of unit bookcases and cupboards by Cranbrook , Mich. ' s Eero Saarinen ( son of famed Finnish Architect Eliel Saarinen ) and Charles Eames . Resting on smooth , knee-high benches , the Saarinen and Eames cupboardry could be stacked in as many window-seat and pigeonhole combinations as any modern apartment would hold . <P> Most sensational exhibit was also a Saarinen &; Eames invention : a chair cast like a piece of sculpture , from a single piece of laminated plywood . Saarinen &; Eames 's new chair , carefully molded to fit the human form and cushioned with a covering of sponge-rubber , looked something like a fur-lined bedpan on stilts . But sitters found that it made up in rump-appeal what it lacked in looks .
