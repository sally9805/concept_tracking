Through the cold , wet darkness , the people hurried homeward silently , drawing threadbare coats tightly around hunched shoulders . Policemen paced beneath feeble street lights , stamping their feet . A sharp wind whispered through shattered walls and broken towers , bringing shivers to everyone in Nrnberg . This was a night which had been longed for by millions in death cells , in all of Europe 's fearful prisons and pens . But now , in the piercing wind , victors and vanquished alike felt the chilling doubts that invariably attend man 's deliberate killing in the name of justice . <P> 9 p.m . The eleven men for whom this night held no dawn ate a last supper of potato salad , sausage , cold cuts , black bread and tea . At 9 p.m. , the prison lights were dimmed . At 10:45 , U.S. Army Security officer Colonel Burton C. Andrus walked across the prison courtyard to set the night 's lethal machinery in motion . The whole prison was permeated by the thought of impending death . ( The Courthouse movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <P> Just then Hermann Gring was crunching a phial of potassium cyanide ( no one knew where it came from ) . When guards and a chaplain rushed into his cell , he was dying . Meanwhile , near Nrnberg 's old imperial Castle , a band of German children hung Gring in effigy . Then they burned the makeshift scaffold and silently marched around the fire , watching it scatter weird shadows among the rubble . <P> In the small gymnasium of the jail ( its floor dusty , its walls dirty grey ) , three black gallows had been erected with more attention to numerology than to efficiency . The platforms were eight feet apart , stood eight feet above the ground , measured eight feet square . From each platform rose two heavy beams , supporting a heavy crosspiece with a hook for the rope in the middle . An inconspicuous lever served to open the traps . The space beneath the traps was hidden by curtains . 1:11 a.m . Two white-helmeted guards led Joachim von Ribbentrop from his cell down the corridor and across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes half closed . The wind ruffled his sparse grey hair . Overhead , the same wind whipped clouds into bizarre patterns . <P> At 1:11 a.m. he entered the gymnasium , and all officers , official witnesses and correspondents rose to attention . Ribbentrop 's manacles were removed and he mounted the steps ( there were 13 ) to the gallows . With the noose around his neck , he said : " My last wish ... is an understanding between East and West . . . . " All present removed their hats . The executioner tightened the noose . A chaplain standing beside him prayed . The assistant executioner pulled the lever , the trap dropped open with a rumbling noise , and Ribbentrop 's hooded figure disappeared . The rope was suddenly taut , and swung back &; forth , creaking audibly.
