txt IRKED CITY STAFFS BEGIN 6-DAY WEEK Mayor 's Example Fails to Cool Resentment as Workers Kill Time With Little to Do By PAUL R. CROWELL Many thousands of city workers , to whom Saturday has for many years been a half-holiday , worked until 5 P. M. yesterday in compliance with Mayor La Guardia 's recent order establishing a six-day week for the duration of the war . The Mayor himself set an example . He arrived at City Hall at 9:30 A. M. and left for the day at 6:05 P. M. ' Virtually all city employes affected by the new six-day week were administrative and clerical workers in city departments and agencies . The heads of the various departments , in nearly all instances , were at their desks early in the morning and remained until late in the afternoon , although a few were reported to be out of their offices attending to routine business . The army of city employes observed the Mayor 's new ruling with mixed emotions , the predominant one being thinly veiled resentment , despite statements by " spokesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various departments housed in or near the Municipal Building revealed the presence of full clerical staffs instead of the skeleton forces usually found on a Saturday . In some departments where on previous Saturdays the visitor // IRKED CITY STAFFS BEGIN 6-DAY WEEK // found only closed doors , the full staffs were on hand . In some departments employes were desperately trying to " kill time . " Some were playing games and others were sitting idly at their desks or toying with papers . The bustle of activity always found on a normal working day was conspicuously absent . In one important department a clerical employe voiced the sentiment that seemed to prevail in many other offices . " I would n't mind so much if I was making bandages or working , on shell cases or doing something else of value to the war effort , " he aid . " But this sitting around just doing nothing gets my goat . ' I ca n't see the point of it . " An executive in one city department tried to explain " the point of it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , for the time when increasing drains on city departments because of drafts for military duty will throw upon diminished staffs the burden of doing much more work . The six-day week brought benefits to the eating places near City Hall and the Municipal Building . Their facilities were taxed to capacity during the period from noon to 2 P. M. In some cases additional space for diners had to be provided by opening sections usually closed down on Saturdays . The restaurant in the Municipal Building did a land-office business . Newsdealers and other vendors in the neighborhood had increased sales . A few department heads , who insisted upon anonymity , voiced the opinion that the six-day week for clerical and administrative Employes was , at least under present conditions , of doubtful value . This group pointed out that virtually every important city department , especially those whose functions are related to public safety , health and transportation , functions at least six days a week , and sometimes seven , through use of skeleton staffs and the practice of having all key men available for emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , no one could be found to say that the sixday week was unsatisfactory , unnecessary or unfair . A spokesman for the Department of Docks said that its employes had no complaints to make . In the Welfare Department a spokesman expressed the same sentiments . Commissioner William F. Carey of the Department of Sanitation said that the extra half day could be " used to good advantage . " In the Department of Education the usual 12:30 F. M. closing was observed . It was explained that since the department came under State jurisdiction the establishment of a full working day on Saturday must be formally approved by the Board of Education , which does not meet until Wednesday . At the offices of the Department of Health Commissioner John L. Rice said he was making a survey to determine what use could be made of the additional time . It was suggested that perhaps some clinics would be open Saturday afternoons . About a thousand civilian employes in the Police Department were affected by the Mayor 's order , and some regular members of the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerical work in bureaus where most of the workers are civilians . Among this group some resentment was evident at having to work the additional half day . but , as in the case of other departments , no one would permit himself to be quoted . At the office of the clerk of the Court of Special Sessions the usual noon closing was observed , but it was said that the closing hour next Saturday would be 5 P. M. and that on that day court itself would probably sit . At least 285 employes of the Municipal Civil Service Commission were affected by the full Saturday ruling , according to Commissioner Paul J. Kern . " For us it 's just another working day , " he said . " All the employes are busy as bees . " In the Municipal Building the full staff of forty elevator operators was on hand throughout the entire day . On past Saturdays operators have been permitted to go home as the traffic in the building diminished , with only a skeleton crew on hand during the afternoon . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600 worked until 5 P. M. , which was also quitting time for 900 employes in the office of City Treasurer Almerindo Portfolio . In the Department of Housing and Buildings a full staff of 1,000 employes was on hand all day , instead of the usual Saturday skeleton force . An exception to the general rule was found in the office of Borough President Edgar Nathan Jr. , where the usual Saturday skeleton force was on duty . The Mayor , it was explained , had not asked Mr. Nathan to have a full staff on hand . Mr. Nathan is an elected official while all other executives in the Municipal Building are appointees of the Mayor . Mr. Nathan himself was not on hand , as he is a strict observer of the Jewish Sabbath . During the afternoon few of the departments had any direct contact with the public and the Municipal Building and other offices housing city departments took on a deserted appearance . It was during this afternoon period that city employes found it difficult to find work . Spokesmen for a number of departments said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch up on routine office business and to clear the decks for resumption of full activity on the following Monday .
