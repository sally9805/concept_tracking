Sober-minded Democrats in Washington admit that the President is running like a jack rabbit for a fourth term , and that there is no way to stop him . Last week one of the highest-ranking New Dealers told TIME that there is no longer any doubt : the President will have things neatly and exactly arranged for a fourth term nomination , will be nominated and reelected . This New Dealer foresaw a whale of a fight , but certain victory . <P> Behind this view lay this theory : the President , and events , have now worked the Democratic Party around to a position where it must nominate him . If the opposition stands firm against him , the next convention will make a Donnybrook Fair look like a love feast , and the Party will be left sprawling and broken . In this situation the President can easily rig the show for himself .
