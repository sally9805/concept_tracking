The U.S. Army Ordnance Department is getting set to mass-produce an explosive that may prove as shattering as the " new and highly secret " ammunition Great Britain recently put to work ( TIME , Nov. 10 ) . Whether in fact the Army 's new explosive is identical with the British blaster , the Ordnance Department is not saying , but it does admit that its mysterious new stuff wallops 40% harder than TNT , hitherto the strongest bursting charge in general use . <P> When the potent new explosive goes into mass production , it will head an impressive list of U.S. military explosives . Chief items : TNT , amatol ( a mixture of TNT and ammonium nitrate for artillery shells and aerial bombs ) , smokeless powder ( long in use as a propellant ) , tetryl ( used in shell boosters to provoke the detonation of laggardly TNT or amatol ) . Least sensitive of all the Ordnance powders is ammonium pictrate , which is used in armor-piercing projectiles because it can wham through steel without going off at first impact .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
