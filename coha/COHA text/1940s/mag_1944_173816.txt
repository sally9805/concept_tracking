. The curtain had gone up on the last act of the Battle of Europe . Beyond doubt the fierce Allied offensive in Italy was the opening scene . General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander made that clear in his order of the day : <P> " From east and west , from north and south , blows are about to fall which will result in the final destruction of the Nazis and bring freedom once again to Europe . ... To us in Italy has been given the honor to strike the first blow . " <P> D-Day Jitters . Nazi-controlled radio stations nervously announced that D-day for invasion had arrived . Even the usually conservative communique of the German High Command picked up the theme . <P> It recognized the urgency of the day by using the word " invasion " for the first time , explained solemnly that Allied air attacks on western Europe could now " be regarded as preparatory to invasion . " An official military spokesman added that the High Command " expects the flare-up of fighting in Italy to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was a safe enough guess ; fighting had spread already . From Yugoslavia Marshal Tito reported heavy Partisan attacks on German communication lines through the Vardar and Ibar Valleys , main routes to Greece . Albanian and Greek Partisans also reported fresh activity against German forces . From restless , suffering France came details of the tough resistance put up by the Maquis of the Haute-Savoie region . <P> How to Influence People . How dangerous the Germans considered their position in France could be judged from the text of a Gestapo memorandum to Secret Military Police , smuggled out of France by the underground : <P> " On declaration that any area becomes a zone of operations : all civilians aged from 16 to 50 must be at once formed into labor units and sent as far as possible from the zone . ... If there is passive resistance . . . form reprisal camps for recalcitrants . In case of violence , military law . ... If operations are actually in course in the area : immediate execution without judgment . <P> " Make immediate contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs to their corresponding grades in the Waffen SS . . . . The Milice will be immediately mobilized . It will be supplied with food and ammunition from German Army sources . " <P> The memo concluded gloomily that it would be impossible to make any use of the French gendarmerie or Gardes Mobiles , which are " riddled with resistance operatives . " <P> Final Warning No. - . The Allies had not yet given the word to the conquered to rise up and smite their oppressor : that word probably would not come until Allied troops crossed the Channel . But Russia , ready to start a new drive which presumably will be geared with the invasion , joined the U.S. and Britain in one more stern warning to Germany 's collaborators . Hungary , Rumania , Bulgaria and Finland were told to pull out immediately , or share in the full disaster of Axis defeat . <P> The drama moved thunderously to its climax .
