This week , after being barred from the networks since Jan. 1 when the big chains joined battle with the songwriters ' society , ASCAP music returns to the air . Mutual Broadcasting System approved an agreement with the Society , and in a Garrison finish at St. Louis won ratification from a majority of its 169 member stations . By signing on the eve of the National Association of Broadcasters convention in the same city , at which the battle of music was to be a topic secondary only to the FCC antimonopoly report ( TiME , May 12 ) , Mutual and ASCAP did the big broadcasters one in the eye . <P> By the new agreement the Mutual chain will pay 3% of its gross receipts on a blanket license agreement for the first four years , 3% thereafter until January 1950 . Payment on a pay-as-you-play basis was rejected by Mutual on grounds that the bookkeeping would be too complicated . <P> The new terms were a comedown for ASCAP , which before the music war collected at a blanket rate of 5% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chains to renew contracts . ASCAP General Manager John Paine reckoned that if extended to the entire industry the new terms would yield some $4,200,000 a year . ASCAP 's 1940 revenue ran about $550,000 higher . The contract applies only to network programs . Local affiliates still must sign contracts with ASCAP if they want to use its music on non-network broadcasts . <P> Ratification of the agreement was a surprise the N.A.B. will long remember . Anxious to go to the N.A.B. convention in a strong strategical position , Mutual chieftains had called an extraordinary meeting of Mutual affiliates to consider the agreement before the convention 's start . Even before Mutual 's members had assembled on the swank Starlight Roof of St. Louis ' Hotel Chase , President Neville Miller of N.A.B. , which is dominated by NBC and CBS , had already wired them asking postponement till he could explain matters at the forthcoming convention . <P> Mutual 's General Manager Fred Weber denounced this as an attempt to " coerce , influence or restrain the free choice of action " of Mutual 's affiliates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ASCAP officials lurked hopefully near by . Neville Miller 's pleas and the opposition of John Shepard III , bulky , argumentative president of New England 's Yankee and Colonial networks whose stations pipe in many a big-chain program , deadlocked the voters . <P> It looked as though the Mutual-ASCAP squeeze-by which Mutual would have the advantage of immediate ASCAP music and ASCAP would have a bargaining stick over the rest of the broadcasters-was about to come unstuck . But on Sunday morning Fred Weber got busy on the phone . Sitting in his hotel room , devouring one steak sandwich after another , he began calling Pittsburgh , Texas , Utah , Minnesota . He found one man playing golf , reached another fishing , called another on a yacht , but failed to locate Fort Worth 's Captain Elliott Roosevelt . Mail , wire and phone votes rolled in . By late Sunday the balance shifted , and 86 had agreed to ratify ( one more than the required majority ) . Mutual stockholders met again , and Yankee 's Shepard withdrew his opposition to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition was well organized but reached its peak early in the deliberations.
