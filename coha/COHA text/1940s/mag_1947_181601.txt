At a congress in Wroclaw ( once Breslau ) , Poland 's Socialist Party heard a fateful summons last week . Poland 's Communist Party Secretary General and Vice Premier , Wladyslaw Gomulka , told them : " Conditions make it imperative that a common front must lead to one party . " What Gomulka meant was that the time had come for the Socialists to let themselves be swallowed by the smaller Communist Party . <P> Every Communist and most Socialists knew that it was the logical sequence to the Communists ' successful subjugation of Stanislaw Mikolajczyk 's majority Peasant Party . Though the Socialists had applauded as the Communist-dominated state police decimated the Peasant Party and sent Mikolajczyk scurrying into exile , they screamed in protest at Gomulka 's blunt warning that the Socialists came next . <P> Jozef Cyrankiewicz , Socialist leader and Poland 's Premier , rejected Gomulka 's invitation . He said : " Our party is and will be needed and is of benefit to the Polish nation . " Delegates broke into prolonged cheering , winding up with a spirited singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymn . And when Boleslaw Drobner , Cracow 's short , walrus-mustached Socialist leader who always wears a black worker 's jerkin , added , " We do n't need outsiders to tell us how to run our affairs , " the demonstration was trebled in noise and duration . With a decisive no , the Socialists rejected Gomulka 's suggestion . <P> In the same speech Drobner also said : " We are willing to go forward arm in arm , but we do n't intend to have them lead us by the hand . " And a brother Socialist commented : " Only Drobner would have dared , and managed to get away with it . " The sum of the two statements was simply that Poland 's " united front " government would stay united , and the Polish Socialists ' no really meant not yet .
