The Black Major A Story by Richard Lee Marks Illustrated by Lou Block W HETHER or not this story has a lesson in it that can be tabbed as good or evil , I do n't know . In thinking the story over and over many times , it often seems to me that what lesson there is concerns only practical living and has no moral weight at all . But at other times the story seems to say this : when the price of brotherhood is pain , still the price must be paid . My story concerns a man I knew when he was a supply sergeant in the Army . His name was Darling N. Jefferson . That was an embarrassment for him naturally ; he had been called D.N . for fifteen years until the Army had insisted on a full first name and it was clear on his birth certificate  --  Darling N. Jefferson . For two years during the war I saw Jefferson every day . I was his supply officer . He was then thirty-one , thirty-two . For a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at the time for a supply room . There were also many long nights when Jefferson and I sat up waiting for supplies , smoking cigarettes to stay awake , talking disjointedly under the revealing glare of an unshaded bulb clipped on a drop line to a storage battery . At the end of two years ? and I have n't seen Jefferson since the war  --  I had a picture of the man in the completeness of his life , and only in that completeness is the story of Jefferson comprehensible . Some of the parts of the picture stem from the said and many unsaid things during the long nights and short mornings . Some parts of the picture are not even mine because I know how Jefferson looked to Doctor Bracken , to Frank Gosnolt , our captain who among the officers was called Goose , and how Jefferson seemed to Chummy Robinson , Lish Maxwell , Haines , and the others . Thus my whole picture of Jefferson will not be biased in a complimentary way , although I want to say frankly that I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can catch sight of the man in the fulness of his living . I N MARCH 1945 we had been overseas twenty months . We worked on barren islands in the Pacific , trucking , moving supplies on coral spits where only reedy grass grew . Months passed and we moved from one island to another and there was no need to remember which was which ; they were all sunny and sandy and without people . Months passed and we heard about the war as it moved from island to island thousands of miles away from us . Months and months . We slipped down to the rock bottom of existence . We lived in a sunny emptiness . Our jobs were dull ; our games were dull ; our food was dull ; there was nothing except sun and work . And that was how it was when Doctor Bracken joined our battalion and I did n't think at all about Doctor Bracken until 1 had occasion to be sorry that I had not warned him about Jefferson . Bracken was not an old soldier . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the children called him " sir " and his patients included him in their communal pride for having built the steel mills that for them were all of America , Bracken had entered the Army when he was almost forty and , not only did n't he like Army life , he had a fastidious revulsion For it . He was with the battalion about two weeks when Jefferson reported to the little dispensary on sick call . " Your ailment ? " Bracken asked , sitting behind his desk , preparing to fill in the blanks on his form . " I 've got pains in the chest here , " Jefferson said , holding his hand below the heart , " and aching headaches over the eyes and in the back of my head . " " How long have you been having the headaches ? " " About ten months . " " Have you complained of them before ? " " I 've been complaining ever since they started , " Jefferson said , " but it has n't done any good . " Jefferson pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brief medical histories of men from past sick calls . " It 's all written down there . " Bracken never consulted the cards except to verify his opinion after the patient had left . MAGAZINE " How many times have you been here on sick call ? " Bracken asked . " This is the sixth time . " Doctor Bracken leaned back in his chair and dropped his pen on the paper in front of him . It was a gesture to put patients at their ease since the official routine of questioning was over . Bracken smiled at Jefferson in a friendly way . The doctor after about six months in service was developing a dispensary technique with soldiers . He was feeling justifiedly proud of his adaptation . " How do you like your job , sergeant ? " Bracken asked . " I like it fine , " Jefferson replied . " Worry much about it ? " Bracken said chattily . Jefferson leaned over the doctor 's desk , pressing his knuckles against the smooth glass top , glaring directly into the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Jefferson snapped tightly . " Not about a God-damn thing ! All I ever get from you medics is Christian Science , Christian Science , Christian Science ! The pains are all in my mind ! I imagine ' em all ! I 'm sick and tired of that crap and now I want you to do something for me ! " Jefferson 's eyes burned into Bracken 's face and Jefferson rapped his knuckles meaningfully against the top of the desk . His dispensary technique shattered , Doctor Bracken stood up , responding instinctively like a man in danger , pale and taut . The medical officer and Jefferson stood glaring at each other as if they were ready to fight . Then Jefferson relaxed and stood away from the desk again , fidgeting , glaring at the doctor , looking out the window , glaring again , looking at the paper on the desk . Doctor Bracken controlled himself . He sat down and checked Jefferson 's card in the file box . " You can go and pack your clothes , " the doctor said without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave for the hospital . " I HEARD about Jefferson from Doctor Bracken while we were waiting for the colonel in the shack that we were using for an officers ' mess . Bracken was telling Frank Gosnolt about his extraordinary patient when I walked up . I almost could have guessed from the doctor 's tone of outraged indignation that he had met Jefferson . " The man 's insane , " Bracken said definitely . " I phoned the field hospital and told them that if they send that man back to us he 'll be a danger to his fellow soldiers . " Goose snickered rudely . A two-hundred. pound cattleman from Texas , Gosnolt considered it ridiculous that Jefferson should be thought dangerous . " He 's an unusual type , you know , " the doctor said , noticing Goose 's disdain and striving to emphasize his point , " not the usual type at all . He does n't look like a Negro really . He does n't have the undershot jaw and the receding forehead , as does the typical Negroid . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , but even his lips are n't thick in the usual way . They 're mobile and move around in that half-smile of his . " It seemed to me that Bracken had an unusually vivid impression of Jefferson from their one short meeting . " How sick do you think he is , Doc ? " I asked . " What do you mean how sick ? " the doctor sputtered . " How sick in his body ? How sick in his mind ? In his body he seems all right , a little underweight , very nervous , of course . There 's nothing really wrong with him . The record shows that . But his mind in my opinion is breaking down completely . He 's a dangerous man . " " Hell , Doc , " Goose scoffed , " he ca n't be as dangerous as all that . He 's so skinny any man in my company could take him on . I do n't like the nigger any more than you do . But what gripes me is that he 's goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him here , " Doctor Bracken said with a sniff , feeling that Goose was deprecating his professional judgment , which Goose was . Goose hesitated a minute . " He 's got to stay here ! " Goose shouted suddenly in a shrill voice . " Damn him ! He 's got to stay ! " Goose stamped his foot exictedly against the floor . Doctor Bracken raised his eyebrows and looked with professional curiosity at Goose . The colonel came into the mess and we all thronged in to lunch . Bracken sat with the battalion staff . Goose and I went to the table reserved for our company . Our other three officers were out on a loading detail on the far side of the island . " That doctor 's a moron , " Goose said in a restrained voice as we started on our soup . I noticed that Goose 's normally red face was purplish under the skin . " I think Jefferson just scared him , " I replied . Goose tried to be practical . Since the doctor had ordered Jefferson to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . " Who do you want for supply sergeant ? " Goose asked . " Oh , Henderson Jones probably , he 's broken in . We ca n't get anybody to work hard any more . " I thought a minute . " Do n't you think that Jefferson is coming back ? " Goose shook his head . He finished his soup and propped his elbows on the table . With startling vigor he drove the fist of his right hand into the cupped palm of his left . " I think he 's made it this time , " Goose said , speaking louder . " The yellow bastard 's been complaining and complaining , whining , crying , and now I think he 's made it . God damn him , now I think he 's made it ! This medic will just turn the trick for him . " A couple of the officers at the adjoining table turned in Goose 's direction . I did n't say anything . When I was done with my soup , I buttered a piece of bread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly , grimly . He punched his hands together again . " Do n't you think he might really be sick ? " I asked softly . " In the head , I mean ? " " Sick ? " Goose screamed in exasperation . " Do you go running to the dispensary every time that you get a headache ? Do I ? Do n't you ever get a headache ? When that yellow bastard gets a headache he runs to the doctor and whines . And now he 's gotten so damn good at it , he 's goin ' home ! He 's goin ' home ! " Goose saw the other officers staring at him and he sat back tiredly in his chair . He buried his chin grumpily in his big right hand . The other officers smiled and looked away . I thought about suggesting the idea that , if Jefferson did n't get away from the islands now , his headaches would forever be a part of him . But I did n't suggest anything . I knew how Goose felt . I almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly much to be sick , anything to get away from the shining , echoing vacuum in which we all lived like a little band of prisoners . Why did n't we all get sick like Jefferson ? What kept us all from having headaches and pains in the chest ? We all hated the blazing emptiness and were sick from it . And yet none of its made the first move . The orderly brought the mutton and Goose and I listlessly began to eat . A FTER lunch I walked toward our company orderly room along the main road past the other companies . We were all quartered in tarpaper barracks . There were eight or ten colored soldiers , enlisted men , sitting in the shade of the barracks next to ours . As I walked by , the men stopped talking . They did n't get up or even look self-conscious ; we had all been in the islands too long for that ; they just waited until I had gone by . I climbed up the several steps to our orderly room which , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first barracks . Lish Maxwell , a lanky corporal and the best basketball player in the company , was sitting at the charge-of-quarters desk . I stepped over and looked through the open door into the supply room . Jefferson was in the supply room , moving about quickly , efficiently , the way he always moved . From a bin of shoes he went to a box beside the rifle rack , turned toward a pile of shirts and pants , walked across the room to the cartons of towels , never hesitating , operating apparently on a fixed plan in his mind . 1 was used to seeing Jefferson move about like that , a dusky man in baggy khaki shirt and pants . He never wasted a motion and until a series of movements was completed he never stopped to consider . Now he was packing his duffel hag , exchanging some of his worn clothes for new , picking up a few personal articles that he had kept in the supply room , cigarettes , lighter fluid . There was something peculiar , though , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in the past two years when I had watched him move rapidly around the supply room as he moved now , everything he touched was in better order when he left it  --  if he exchanged a pair of shoes , the old shoes were set to start a row ready for salvage ; if he collected a lot of shirts , the pile was straighter when he was done ; better organization and arrangement were by-products of his activity ; in his wake , things were always in better order . Now as he moved around the room Jefferson disarrayed everything  --  the shoes MAGAZINE were knocked out of place , a rifle was on the floor . Then I knew that something was different inside Jefferson . It may not have been that he was sick . It may have been that he was going out of business . I had nothing to say to him any more . I turned from the door and walked into the section of the orderly room that was partitioned off for the officers . There was a sheaf of staff bulletins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets and sat down at the long side table that the lieutenants used as a desk . Lish Maxwell stuck his head into the office .. He saw me watching him and grinned . " Lieutenant , is Sergeant Jefferson leavin ' the company ? " Maxwell asked . " Why do n't you ask him ? " I replied . " I do n't ask that man nothin ' , " Maxwell said definitely . " Who 's goin ' to be supply sergeant  --  Henderson Jones ? " " Maybe . " Maxwell thought . " Well , " he said after a minute , " I wo n't expect to get stuff so often , but goin ' in the supply room to get it will be a lot more pleasant . " Maxwell withdrew his head . I sat back and looked absently at the bulletins . I HAD met Jefferson 's mother a few weeks before we left Fort Ord for the port of embarkation in 1943 . She was a tall , white-haired colored lady , rigidly straight and thin , like Jefferson . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes in the supply room . I praised her son and she said that our company seemed very nice , except the motor pool which was messy . What impressed me in Mrs. Jefferson was a calm , unrelenting sternness beneath her meek and quiet exterior . The only break in the sternness of Widow Jefferson , as far as I know , was the naming of her son . Having allowed herself that effusion , she proceeded systematically to raise Darling in a neat brown cottage off Central Avenue in the colored section of Los Angeles ' east side . With ruthless severity Widow Jefferson maintained her home in a studied calm aloof from the perpetual carnival of Central Avenue . The tumbling emotions of the people in the neighborhood , the rapid fluctuation from blue tragedy to high giggling glee and back again to tragedy , the precious enmities and quick loves , the sporadic Iivirvr. supine worry about the antagonism he aroused in the clerks . His cleverness with people was very short-ranged ; he was hardly sensitive to general feelings . In 1934 , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quit . On an arrangement with the man who sold cobbling equipment , Jefferson opened his own shoe repair shop three blocks down the Avenue . Jefferson obtained cheap machines ; he worked very late at night and stayed open on Sundays ; " Fast and Good " was his motto ; and within a year his business was established , his loan amortized , and Jefferson was in business for himself . A year later Jefferson opened another shop on the far end of Central Avenue . Both places did very well . He opened a third shop in the neighboring Mexican district . As Jefferson 's business became established , he gradually enlarged the scope of his living . With Mr. Wiggins , a young teacher at the high school , Jefferson began to play golf . Mr. Wiggins and Jefferson found a very natural relaxation in playing golf . Jefferson was not inhibited , and Mr. Wiggins pretended not to be , by the fact that very few colored men in the city played golf . Jefferson also found women . He did not chase the sinewy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical mind Jefferson isolated his desire . He did not covet at all the party atmosphere of the street , the bright lights in the dance halls , the braggadoccio antics in the cafes . That was a part of the neighborhood and Jefferson had never coveted the neighborhood in whole or in part . Jefferson found quiet women , easily manageable , who satisfied him . T HE recession in 1937 came to Central Avenue like a hot wind returning to a dusty prairie . The spirit was blown out again ; the people were down , empty . And the emptiness turned quickly into despair because the short-lived better times seemed like a dream that had passed and the reality of the depression was back again . Central Avenue was crowded again with the ghosts of working men . So Jefferson fired his four highest-paid employees and hired eight replacements . He paid the new men five dollars a week . A local business bureau sent a representative to call on Jefferson . The young man , a graduate of one of the colleges for colored men , entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a pigskin briefcase with his initials stamped on it in little gold letters . The man asked a clerk for Mr. Jefferson and Jefferson came out from the rear of the shop . " My card , " the man said in a sprightly voice . Jefferson looked at the white card with the neatly engraved name , Louis A. Henry , and the name of the business bureau . Jefferson turned the card over several times and then ushered Mr. Henry into the small glassed office in the rear of the shop . Jefferson sat down behind the ledger-covered desk and the representative from the business bureau sat in front of him on the seldom-used other chair . Jefferson was quite curious . " Mr. Jefferson , " Mr. Henry said in an earnest baritone voice , " I want to tell you that our bureau is mighty distressed at your new wage policy . " Jefferson frowned . " Is this bureau of yours , " Jefferson said , " is it tied up with the government ? " " Oh , not at all , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business men dedicated to the improvement of the com-munity . " Jefferson nodded and sat back in his chair . " We 've heard , Mr. Jefferson , that you 're paying only five dollars a week . " Jefferson did not reply . " The men in our bureau believe , " Mr. Henry went on , " even more , we 're certain as business men that wage-cutting is the surest way to prolong the present business recession in the community . " Mr. Henry looked intently at Jefferson . He thought that he had put the matter strongly , tactfully ; he was satisfied with himself . Actually Jefferson was savoring with delight the new words " business recession , " " wage policy , " and " the community . " Jefferson had never had time to think in abstractions . Now lie was faced with abstract argument for the first time . It looked like a fine game . Jefferson liked his position as the prominent business man to whom the earnest young man with the yellow briefcase was appealing . " Go on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was an expression he had heard a judge use in a movie . Jefferson , too , was proud of his performance . " The only way to break the present business recession , we believe , " Mr. Henry said carefully , " is to get more money into circulation . Now we know that we ca n't accomplish that by ourselves . We have to wait for the plants to begin rehiring . But what we can do is not cut wages . By cutting wages were working directly against ourselves by reducing the amount of money that people have to spend . Your clerks are the grocer 's customers and his clerks get their shoes fixed in your shops . When your clerks have less money , the grocer 's business declines . Then he lowers his wages and your business declines , and it works round and round in a vicious circle . " That , Mr. Henry thought , was a classic explanation . Jefferson pondered . " You admit , " Jefferson said slowly , " that a real pick-up in business wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Henry nodded . " That 's right , " Jefferson said , " because I could do without all the business I get from the grocer 's clerks . " " But Mr. Jefferson , you ? " Mr. Henry began . " We business men do two kinds of business , " Jefferson went on , overriding the young man . Jefferson was thinking hard . " One kind is over the counter with the customers . The other kind is through the back door getting supplies . Both of ' em are important . " Mr. Henry was listening . " Now if I buy soles for more than the Greek pays for ' em , " Jefferson said steadily and slowly , " I 'm going to lose in business . " Jefferson paused . " If I pay less , I 'm going to win . " " That 's true , of course , " Mr. Henry admitted , " but --  " " If the Greek wants to pay men six dollars , my men 'll quit and go work for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So they work for me for five . " Jefferson decided . " Then that 's all they 're worth . If they was worth more , the Greek would offer more . " Jefferson became more sure as he thought about it . " I 'd get ' em for four dollars if I could . That 's business . But the lumber yard is paying four and they do n't work as long . " Mr. Henry shook his head sadly . He was forced to be more honest . " Mr. Jefferson , " Mr. Henry said , " there 's also the question of our people . Our people are always oppressed . It is n't decent for us to oppress them ourselves . " That was a straight statement , Mr. Henry felt sure . J EFFERSON leaned over the desk toward the young man . On this subject Jefferson did not have to find his way . " People get what they work for and that 's all they get . " Jefferson said clearly . Then he told Mr. Henry the story , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated from school , his methods when he worked for the Greek , his system for blocking hats , his business arrangements when he started his own shop , how he thought up his motto " Fast and Good , " all of the details in his rise to power . Jefferson liked telling the story . He had never in his life talked so much about himself and all of these things had been in his memory , all of these good things . Mr. Henry listened very patiently . In the face of all the personal evidence , he thought it best to revert to a technical discussion . So he argued all over again his theory of the relation between business and wages , Jefferson countered this time with alacrity , skipping nimbly over his points as they were now clear in his mind . Both men were even more self-satisfying the second time . But when it became Mr. Henry 's turn to reintroduce the plight of the people , the young man recognized the hopelessness of it . So he arose and thanked Mr. Jefferson for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said . Henry left the shop knowing that he had not convinced Jefferson to raise wages , but Henry felt that his arguments could not have been better expressed . And Jefferson sat in his office for ten long minutes , relishing the whole conversation . He had thoroughly enjoyed himself . W HEN the officer in the induction station administered the oath of allegiance to the new draftees , Darling N. Jefferson was removed by government fiat from the world of laisser-faire . As soon as the oath was completed , the officer told all Negroes to form a group in the rear of the room . Then D. N. Jefferson , the founder of the " Fast and Good " shoe repair shops , the American business man who had made his own way and had built a substantial company through his energy , intelligence , and determination , Jefferson , the United States citizen who relaxed at golf and quiet sociability , went into the colored Army . I must explain exactly the kind of army into which Jefferson went . It was our colored Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform , order of rank , pay , in every way except that all of the enlisted men in the colored Army were Negroes . The officers for the colored Army , who were not socially a part of it , and in various experimental lots colored , too . Strict segregation of the colored Army was effected ; the colored Army had its own areas , its own service clubs and post exchanges ; Negroes were not assigned except in the colored Army and Negroes were discouraged from using facilities not their own . In normal civilian living , colored men band together ; there arc restrictive barriers around them , but as with all minority groups there is an internal desire for cohesion as well as an outside pressure that forces cohesion . When Negroes were drafted into the colored Army that was like an isolation ward within our national Army , the desire for cohesion was greatly accentuated . It was a necessity to stick together ; it was an order . The closeness that had existed in civilian life developed into a pressing spirit of community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of sympathy that covered them all . MAGAZINE Jefferson was placed in the colored Army for the indisputable reason that he was colored . As a part of the colored Army , Jefferson was included in a group of men almost painfully conscious of kinship  --  a kinship for which Jefferson in his entire life had never had any respect or need . Jefferson had never had time to be self-conscious ; he was too busy to he sympathetic . But now Jefferson had to share with all the other men , with all of them that he could see or find to talk to , he had to share their self-consciousness for being colored ; he had to share their enveloping sympathy ; he had to share or isolate himself . Y MIND was occupied with Jefferson and his source-springs and his fate on that day when he was packing to leave the company . I tossed down the bulletins and walked into the supply room . Jefferson was still packing his duffel . I walked over and sat down at a small table in the corner where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on assembling his equipment . The whole supply room was ruffled as if an irritable wind had played over it . Chummy Robinson came up the steps and through the side door into the supply room . He was singing , but his music stopped when he saw Jefferson loading his duffel near the door . - Where y'goin ' , man ? " Chummy asked in thick wonder . Jefferson raised his head as he rearranged his articles in the bag . " Hospital , " Jefferson snapped . " Wha ' fo ' ? " Jefferson thought . Headaches . Pains in the chest . " For the French influenza , " Jefferson said acidly . Chummy 's sleepy lids lifted . He stood and grappled with the new thought , trying to fit it into a picture that his mind could understand . After a minute Chummy asked , " How 's dat diffrunt from d ' reglar flu ? " Jefferson turned toward Chummy . " Now how would you know the symptoms for any kind of flu ? " Jefferson said . " Take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chummy sulked . " Take it now , " Jefferson ordered . Chummy slouched over and began to drag the duffel toward the door . " I know yer room , " Chummy grumbled over his shoulder . " Dat 's d ' one nobody goes in . " Chummy dragged the bag down the steps . Jefferson glanced around the room , checking items in his mind . He saw me watching him and presumed that I . had watched him and Chummy . " You can tell ' em anything , " Jefferson said and shrugged . " French influenza or Chinese cancer , they do n't know . " Outside I heard someone  --  Maxwell , I think  --  call to Chummy , " Where y'goin ' ? " " I ai n't goin ' noplace , " Chummy called back . " It 's d ' Black Major dat 's leavin ' . " The Black Major , I mused ; I had almost forgotten the men 's nickname for Jefferson . It was a behind-the-hand nickname ; no one ever spoke it openly to Jefferson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since our activation in California would remember . But Chummy was one of our charter members ; and now when Jefferson picked on him and spoke to him sharply , degradingly , without any feeling for the fact that they had lived together for two years , it was logical that the picture should flood Chummy 's mind of the time when Jefferson had earned his nickname . We had been activated in California for only about two weeks when the company was jolted by a shocking incident . A major who was in command of the battalion to which our company was assigncd was walking through our motor pool on a routine inspection . He wanted to question some of the men so he turned at random to Belue Davis , who was working on the engine of his truck , and called , " You , black boy , come over herel " Twelve men , including two sergeants , witnessed the insult . Immediately after the supper meal that night , a few sergeants rounded up all of the men and assembled the company downstairs in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the southern Negroes were apathetic and a few of the young men were silly , but when the whole company was assembled without officers , there was an impressive seriousness among all the men . The idea of a meeting on their own was exciting . Preston T. Haines , one of the platoon sergeants and a high-school graduate from Chicago , talked to the men and told them what had happened . Then he called on those who had witnessed the insult toconfirm him . Each of the twelve replied : " That was how it happened , " " Clear as could be  --  black boy , " and " You got it right . " The solemnity with which the answers were given increased the tenseness of the men . The barracks was like a courtroom in which each soldier was a judge and a judge of a major 's conduct . Even the most somnambulant Southerners were caught up in the common spirit of opposition to indignity . " Now fellas , " Haines said , " so far the army 's been square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our set-up here . So I ca n't see that we have any right to blame the Army for this . The major is n't the Army . He 's just one man who thinks he 's better than all the rest of us . And that 's where he 's wrong . So I propose that we send a committee to go tell the captain . The captain can tell the colonel . And the colonel can teach this major some proper manners . " The barracks buzzed with excited whispering . " By complaining through channels , like we 're supposed to , " Haines continued , " we 're just saying that we 're as good men as this major . We 're not asking for anything special except to be treated right . And that , we 're entitled to ! " There were yelps of affirmation . The men could hardly sit still . Their racial self-conseriousness was suddenly given an outlet in specific complaint . An unquestionably right articulation was afforded to relieve the dull feeling of oppression that was usually an unsubstantial something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against or even realize exactly . Now there was something to do , something specific to say . Every man felt his blood beating inside him . T HEN Darling N. Jefferson , the acting supply sergeant , spoke up from the rear of the room . He was leaning casually against one of the wooden supports , but his voice was sharp and definite . " I do n't sec what you 're making all the fuss about , " Jefferson said . The men quieted to hear him . " So the major called Belue Davis ' black boy ' ? so what ? People are calling each other names all over the world every day . It do n't mean a thing . " The men were baffled . What Jefferson said went against every feeling that they possessed . " You scared , man ? " someone shouted . That was all that could be imagined . There were several shouts of " Yeah ! " and " Scared ! " after the question . Jefferson remained jauntily leaning against the wooden support . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said coolly without either excitement or much interest . " We all got jobs to do . The major 's got his job . If we do our jobs right , nothing can bother us . If the major do n't do his , he 'll find out fast enough . " Everybody began to babble and the din rose in the room . Jefferson missed the whole point . Belue Davis was shouting about " equality " ? Lisp Maxwell was dancing around on top of a bunk  --  all of the men were jabbering in a cacophony of resentment toward Jefferson . The truth was simple . In that whole barracks room , out of our entire company , Jeffer-on was the only man who knew that he was as good a man as the major . And lie did n't care a hit about what the major had to say so long as it did not affect him and his work . To Preston T. Haines , the major had challenged the equal status of the Negro . And equality was a delicate , hardly won thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of the men in the company were behind Haines in his defense of the standard . But Jefferson was certain , absolutely certain that true equality was an existing fact . He was the only one . " Damn it ! " Haines hollered above the crowd . " Men should n't be called ' black boy ' in the American Army ! " " Army or civilian life  --  what 's the difference ? " Jefferson replied . " We do our job and the major does his . Who cares what he has ? " The grumbling rumbling talk of the men drowned him out . " I 'm calling for a voter Haines shouted . " Al in favor of sending a committee to the captain , raise their hands ! " All of the hands except one were raised . Jefferson shrugged . Haines and two other sergeants saw Goose that night , informed him about the major 's conduct and registered the company 's complaint . After the sergeants left , the officers talked the matter over . Goose did n't like the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were to keep any morale in the company , there was no choice . So Goose MAGAZINE told the colonel , a fiery old soldier who was revolted by the major 's stupidity , and the major was ordered to apologize to our company the very next day . Our men stood up proudly while the major said , openly , that he was sorry and the major went on to talk up the war effort in which we were all fighting together . T HATwas the picture in Chummy 's mind when Jefferson picked on him  --  the picture of Jefferson standing alone against the whole company and of the men later , in the certainty of their rightness as proved by all events , sarcastically dubbing Jefferson the Black Major . After three months of training in California our company went overseas . We went directly to the quiet islands and moved supplies from here to there and from there to there on bits of sandy waste insignificant to the war . For a while the sounds we were used to echoed in our ears . Then gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we began to writhe in the emptiness of our existence . Months passed and a year passed and more months . Goose and I and the other officers lived together and worked together in the aching dullness ; with each of us watching the other , we did our jobs . In the company area the enlisted men lived and worked through the same collective reflex . We all plodded along in an empty world . It was bad for all of us , but for Jefferson it was terrible . His job in the supply room became automatic and there was no room for expansion ; when the job became static for him , it became repulsive . Outside the supply room there were no women , no games of golf . But for Jefferson there were n't even any men . Jefferson lived in the company as he had lived all his life , apart from the others , shunning brotherhood , scorning the closeness of the colored men and their common spirit . And the men held away from Jefferson because he moved too fast and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson was unsympathetic . It was customary for ranking sergeants to live . two or three together , in the private rooms at the end of the barracks . But no one ever shared Jefferson 's room . It was a distinction to live with a little privacy , but the distinction never lured anyone to share Jefferson 's quarters . Jefferson lived in the company as if he were in solitary confinement . He was not a member of a group of men . He lived unconscious of the men around him . They were facts of the environment to him , nothing else . The communal tension that held the rest of us in line did not touch Jefferson . He sat by himself in the sun . He thought about the pleasing past until memory became a worthless toy . Then Jefferson was isolated , completely atone . He found himself in a vacuum . A human being can not live alone in a vacuum . Things came to Jefferson to fill the emptiness . First there was a heavy weariness and he lay on his cot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been his lifelong habit was interrupted . After the weariness he sensed plots against him , evil machinations concocted by the officers and the other men while he lay abed . Then he arose apprehensively and rushed around , listening , staring , penetrating into all the corners that were strange to him . His body worked fast , but after his weariness his body no longer worked with the same perfection . His hands moved in wasted motions . Hewalked around the edges of the company area . Then finally the enemy became clear to him . He had headaches and pains in the chest . I SAW Jefferson for the last time when he came out of the barracks with his duffel on his shoulder . I was standing on the steps in front of the orderly room . Lish Maxwell and a couple of the men were sitting in a jeep that was parked at the side of the building . We all watched Jefferson as he walked toward the path that led to the dispensary . Jefferson looked back at us . First he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't . Jefferson 's gaze was crazy , jittery ; his left hand twitched around his ribs while the knuckles of his right hand were white as coral as he gripped the neck of his duffel . Jefferson glanced from me to the men in the jeep . He turned away from us all toward the dispensary . " G'by , man , " Maxwell shouted loudly , in a full voice and , I think , with sympathy . " Yeah , g'hy , " the other soldiers chorused , " G'by . " Jefferson walked straight down the path away from us . He made not the slightest move to glance back over his shoulder and say good-by.
