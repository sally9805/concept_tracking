Biographers who have pictured Composer Richard Wagner as a bit of a blackguard , a touch of a toady , had some added evidence last week . Musical Courier printed some early Wagnerian letters , extracted from a Swiss musical journal by Robert Hernried , Viennese refugee and music professor at St. Ambrose College , Davenport , Iowa . <P> In his later years , Wagner was one of Germany 's prime anti-Semites . He wrote Das Judenthum in der Musik ( Judaism in Music ) , in Oper und Drama attacked a Jewish composer-Giacomo Meyerbeer ( born Jakob Beer , of a Berlin banking family ) . But in the 18405 , his letters now reveal , Wagner licked Jewish boots and liked it . Meyerbeer , whose brassy , spectacular operas influenced Wagner 's early work , was a power not only in Berlin but in Paris , whose musical tastes he formed . <P> Wagner begged Meyerbeer 's help in getting hearings for his Flying Dutchman , Rienzi , Tannhduser . Typical Wagner letter to Meyerbeer ( who came across with the help ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeon to aeon until , irked by having no peace even in the hereafter , you will consign me to Hell ! Then you will no longer hear me , but I can assure you that I will continue to stammer my thanks even there . Until that moving catastrophe will have occurred , I will once more presume on your kindness . . . . Your servant , eternally devoted to you with heart and blood . "
