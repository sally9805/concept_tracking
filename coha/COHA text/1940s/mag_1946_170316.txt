British Sportswriter Peter Wilson took a mournful look at Britain 's recent sports record . Russia had beaten the British at soccer , France had eliminated their Davis Cuppers , the U.S. had just flattened Britain 's best boxers and her No. 1 golfer . Wrote Wilson last week in London 's Sunday Pictorial : " Losers , losers , all the time . <P> " The decline and fall of our athletic prowess has been going on so long that I find myself thinking up excuses for our probable defeat even before the event has started . <P> " I suggest that we try to ' conscript for sport . ' America has always believed in specialization and has done everything to encourage any outstanding youth . France has come into line , using great athletes as directors i.e. , at paid jobs . <P> " We have two choices-either to quit international competition or to change our whole system of training , selection and tactics so that we can look like we are competing on even terms with other nations .
