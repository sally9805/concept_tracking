The first faint flush of light that sometimes precedes the dawn is called the false dawn . <P> Last week the 21 Indian delegates , gathered around the long teak table in the Simla conference room , learned that the hope of self-government for India had also been a false dawn . The bright hopes for success which had inspired the Simla Conference almost to the end were over . <P> At the head of the conference table the Viceroy , Lord Wavell , his face showing the strain of a fortnight 's recurring crises , announced that his present effort to give India self-government had failed . Of the parties represented , all but the Moslem League had handed him lists of prospective members of the proposed Executive Council . The predominantly Hindu Congress party had been willing to take office . But , in the person of its President Mohamed Ali Jinnah , the Moslem League had rejected Wavell 's plan . <P> Said the Viceroy : " I therefore made my provisional selections , including certain Moslem League names . . . . Mr. Jinnah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was so decided that I felt it would be useless to continue discussions . The conference has therefore failed . " <P> Then Lord Wavell made a remarkable statement : " I wish to make it clear that the responsibility for the failure is mine . The main idea underlying the conference was mine . If it had succeeded , its success would have been attributed to me , and I can not place the blame for its failure upon any of the parties . " <P> By assuming all , the Viceroy had absolved even the Moslem League for its part in wrecking the conference . The door to reconciliation was thus left open a crack . <P> In the U.S. , Sirdar J. J. Singh , president of the India League of America , declared the meeting " a striking evidence of the desire of the vast majority of Indians to work together and . . . also an evidence of the continuing British policy of unduly emphasizing minorities . " He characterized the Moslem League 's behavior at Simla as " coercion of the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference " only to the extent that he has allowed himself to be bullied into retreat by a small minority .
