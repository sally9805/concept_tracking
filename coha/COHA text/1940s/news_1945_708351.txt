txt 3 DAYS EACH WEEK WITHOUT RED MEAT PROPOSED BY MAYOR Would Apply to Restaurants , Hotels and Other Public Eating Places in City CURBS IN HOMES ASKED Leftover Mondays ' Suggested to Cut Consumption , With Butchers Closing Some Days Three days a week without red meats in the restaurants , hotels and other public eating places will be sought by Mayor La Guardia on his return from Washington , the Mayor said yesterday . He disclosed he would seek to add " By-Products Monday " to what he described as " Meatless Tuesday " and " good , old Fish Friday . " A corresponding reduction in meat-eating at home , with butcher shops closed several days a week to reduce their overhead expenses , is also on the program . " Consumers must reduce their consumption of meat , " declared the Mayor , saying that meat would remain scarce here for several months , largely because many slaughterers in New York and New Jersey had fallen behind in their Government set-asides and had to make than up out of current kills . On Mondays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public eating places would be devoid of meats other than kidneys , tripe , tongue , sweetbreads and other byproducts of the slaughterhouses . He hinted that hash might be permissible on Mondays . Leftovers for Homes " You and I , talking at home , can call it leftovers on Mondays , " the Mayor said in his regular wN-rc broadcast from City Hall , " but , of course , the ritzy places  --  they can not call it leftovers , so they will have by-product menus on Mondays , if you get what I mean . " The immediate response to the Mayor 's plan was favorable on the part of the organized restaurateurs , who have had trouble getting meat for their rationed allotment and face a sharp reduction in choice quality supplies under the new national meat program that goes into effect Jan. 29 . " It is a good and a timely plan , " Paul Henkel , president of the Society of Restaurateurs , said of the Mayor 's proposal , " but it should be enforced on everyone . Just a voluntary system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places in the city , not more than 8,000 have observed meatless Tuesdays , instituted by the Mayor about two years ago , Mr. Henkel said . " The better restaurants are still keeping meatless Tuesdays and Fridays , " said Mr. Henkel . " More than half the eating places , including drug stores and lunch counters , are not doing so . It wo n't be fair if we cut out red meats on Mondays , too , and they keep on selling meat . We need something like the meatless days of the last war . They were enforced by the Government . " May Seek Federal Regulation What sanctions , if any , the Mayor may seek to enforce the " meatless " days remained a question last night . The Mayor , who is to go today to Washington to confer with Federal officials on several matters , including meat , did not say how he proposed to effectuate his program . It was considered possible that he might seek Federal regulation of " meatless " days . Disapproval of the plan was voiced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fifteen of the leading hotels in the city had met two weeks ago to discuss the practicability of instituting a meatless day and had rejected it . ; , rczaph Eschelbacher , secretary of the State Association of Retail Meat Dealers , said the proposal to close butcher shops several days a // week would be welcomed by the retailers if it succeeded in reducing their expenses . He said most of the retailers could sell in two days all the meat they get for a week , but said he did not know what the reaction would be from the union if employes were laid off for the other days . Mayor La Guardia , who devoted most of his regular Sunday broadcast to food problems , denounced fish retailers who he said had raised their prices last week after the Mayor 's advice to housewives to buy more fish . Quoting a ceiling price of 23 bents a pound on both haddock and eod in independent food stores , the Mayor said many retailers had charged up to 30 and 35 cents a pound last week because " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just for that , " the Mayor said , " I am going to say that in the chain stores you can get haddock and cod for 21 cents . If you do not play the game , I am going to boost the chain stores and give the chain store prices . " Enough is enough , " the Mayor exclaimed . " Mr. Retailer , independent dealer , your price is 23 cents a pound and you stick to that 23 cents per pound . I will help you next week , if you play the game this week . If you do not , I have something else up my sleeve . " Sol Wolpow , general manager of the United Retail Fish Dealers Association , said last night that the Mayor was creating confusion between housewives and retailers " when , without any knowledge of prices , he tells consumers to pay no more than 23 cents a pound for cod and haddock . " . Mr. Wolpow said the Office of Price Administration permitted a price of 28 cents a pound for drawn haddock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolpow , a municipal spokesman said the Mayor had been speaking of cod and haddock for fish chowder when helirst quoted the 23-cent price in his broadcast a week earlier , and that the top legal price for " round " haddock and cod , the kind used for chowder , was 23 cents in Group 3. and 2 stores and 21 cents in Group 3 and 4 stores . In his broadcast , the Mayor renewed his plea to Washington to issue different stamps for meat and butter rationing .
