General Motors Corp . rolled out a sleek , newfangled diesel train this week that will make rail traveling almost as comfortable as staying at home-and far more glamorous . The most eye-catching changes in the cars are second-story " astra domes " in which travelers can dine and get a hedgehopping bird's-eye view of the scenery . <P> The train 's four cars ( " Dream Cloud , " " Moon Glow , " " Stardust , " " Skyview " ) also have inter-car and " train-to-anywhere " phone systems , loudspeaker systems , and " Sleepy Hollow " chairs , adjustable to nine positions . The chairs have individual fluorescent lights , radio receivers and built-in ashtrays . In the compact sleeping cars , equipment folds away to allow 50% more floor space than usual . For safety , each car is equipped with a warning system which sets off an alarm when journal boxes become overheated . <P> G.M. , which is interested in selling its diesel engines , air-conditioners , etc. , rather than in building complete trains ( Pullman-Standard Co. built the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six months , then sell it . But rail travelers will not have to wait to enjoy some of its advantages . Since war 's end , equipment manufacturers have produced 721 new cars with many of the features of G.M. 's train ( 49 dome cars are now being built ) . Although such first-rate equipment is still short ( 2,486 more cars are on order ) , the railroads have put on 22 completely new trains giving better service all over the U.S. Some of the newest trains : <P> Great Northern Railway 's Empire Builder , which cuts the regular 58-hour schedule from Chicago to Seattle by almost 15 hours . Its lavish decor , different in each of its twelve cars , matches the scenery en route , which is described over amplifiers by a trained guide . <P> Illinois Central Railroad 's City of New Orleans , first to offer one-day service between Chicago and New Orleans ( 921 miles in 15 hours , 55 min . ) . Besides many of the attractions of G.M. 's train , it has rubber floors to eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Ohio Railroad 's Cincinnatian , an all-coach Cincinnati-to-Baltimore train . Features : stewardess-nurse service , women &; children 's infirmary . <P> But for coach riders , in general , the way is still bumpy , dirty and uncomfortable . The railroads have ordered 3,142 coaches to replace what Railroader Robert R. Young calls " Toonerville equipment . " But only 90 a month are being produced . Not for at least two years will the railroads get the bulk of the $300 million in new coach equipment now on order .
