In a Paris clinic a shriveled old man with a magnificent head lay dying . His contemporaries among the giants of socialism were long gone-Lenin of Russia , Juars of France , Liebknecht of Germany . <P> But Francisco Largo Caballero , who had shaped the history of Spain by fighting stubbornly for the things he wanted , fought on for breath . If he could still remember , his memories must have been bitter . <P> Largo Caballero had had as hard an education as the 20th Century could give . Spain 's schools were not for the sons of village carpenters . But at 24 , a plasterer in Madrid , he had taught himself to read . The dogmatic tracts of Castilian Socialist Pablo Iglesias were what he read . <P> Path Up . He had carried his Marxist beliefs into the labor movement , become president of the Madrid builders ' union . Later , he sat in a dingy little office on Madrid 's Calle de Fuencarral , directing the Union General de Trabajadores , Spain 's C.I.O. , building it to 1,500,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it , but was forced to it again &; again by the violent faith he had espoused-and the violent reaction that faith provoked . In 1917 , when he was 48 , he led his first revolutionary general strike . He was arrested , sentenced to life imprisonment . Elected to the Cortes , he was released and permitted to take his seat . When he was 61 , in 1930 , he tried revolution again , spent three months in jail . In 1934 Largo Caballero was hurled into jail a third time , charged with helping foment the Asturian miners ' revolt . <P> Path Down . His wife 's sudden death helped free him . He was permitted to attend her funeral and , flanked by his prison guards , he marched behind her casket through Madrid 's streets . More than 60,000 of his followers lined the way , saluting him with clenched fists . Hurriedly , the Government brought him to a belated trial and acquittal . <P> When Franco rose against the Republic , the old labor chieftain rushed to its defense , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , armed the labor unions . He sounded like his old Barcelona anarchist competitors when he growled : " I would like to see every bricklayer go to work with his rifle slung on his shoulder . Then I know that nothing could exist in Spain except the will of the great mass of the Spaniards . " <P> In his blue overalls and carrying a rifle , he went out to the front lines to be photographed , as Winston Churchill was to do later . When the photographers were not present , Largo Caballero wandered to more dangerous places , turned over dead bodies , stared into lifeless faces . His son , a Loyalist militiaman , was missing . <P> Nothing went according to those pat , rigorous socialist books he had read long ago . The struggle between the factions in the Republican Government reached the point where he was forced from office . He retired , accusing the Communists of using the civil war to take over Spain . But he remained loyal to the Republic , fled with its Government to France . There the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
