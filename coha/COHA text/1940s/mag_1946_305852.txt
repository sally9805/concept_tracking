JOY-Georges Bernanos ( 297 pp. ) - Translated by Louise Varse-Panfheon Books ( $2.75 ) . <P> Georges Bernanos is France 's most distinguished Catholic author-and his own Church 's sharpest critic . His literary reputation rests chiefly on three religious novels : Diary of a Country Priest , Joy , The Star of Satan ( TIME , June 17 , 1940 ) . Joy won the Prix Femina in 1929 , and now appears in translation for the first time . <P> The difference between Joy and such popular religious novels as The Robe and The Song of Bernadette is the difference between a papal nuncio and a parish priest . Essentially a parable of intellectual temptation , the book is primarily dialectical in method , and almost wholly devoid of the usual stage effects of fiction . It is charged with burning vitality , but its drama exists mainly in the consciences of the characters . <P> Saint &; Symbol . Joan of Arc , France 's patron saint-who was persuaded by her inquisitors to deny her visionary powers-has long served Bernanos as a symbol of Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a much-modified Joan , facing present-day inquisitors in modern dress . <P> Youthful , maidenly Chantal lives in a French chateau whose Second Empire shrubberies and wide , tawny avenues are described by Bernanos with vivid feeling . With her live her timid , pedantic father ( who has written volumes of history but can not stir a step without the counsel of his psychiatrist ) and her psychotic grandmother ( who still clutches to her bosom the keys of storage cupboards that have long ceased to exist ) . Of such as them , Chantal says simply : " What can God find to say to those who , of their own free will , of their own weight incline toward sadness and turn instinctively toward the night ? " <P> Flesh &; Blood . It is Chantal 's own obsession with gladness and light that is her undoing . Her moments of spiritual illumination are regarded by those around her as a nervous disorder , and , like Saint Joan , she is forced to submit to questioning . When her first inquisitor , her hysterical father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in . The psychiatrist emerges from the ordeal fit to be put in a strait jacket . Then a perspicacious Catholic abb , who has secretly doubted the existence of God for many years , is summoned-and finds himself newly inspired with religious faith . <P> Unlike Saint Joan , Chantal repels her inquisitors . Like Saint Joan , she can not protect herself against brute force , and her murder by her father 's tormented chauffeur ( to whom the spectacle of innocence is intolerable ) brings the book to a bloody end . <P> The bulk of Joy is composed of argument and counterargument , so abstruse that a majority of readers may feel that <P> Bernanos is trying to explore states of mind too private to be communicable . Few novelists could give flesh and blood to such a clutter of spiritual skeletons as inhabit the De Clergerie chateau ; even fewer could use a teen-age girl as the symbol for an exalted faith without making her too good to be true . Joy is fair evidence of why Novelist Bernanos has never influenced many and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
