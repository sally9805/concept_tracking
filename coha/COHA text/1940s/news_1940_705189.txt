txt AID NOW UNLIKELY Senate Committee Will Take Up Proposals Delay Expected BRITISH SHIP LOSS GRAVE Minister Declares Sinkings Exceed Empire 's Capacity to Fill Gap Unaided By TURNER CATLEDGE special to Tam Nsvr YORE Tnsiss . WASHINGTON , Nov. 26 ? Two measures bearing upon American financial aid to Great Britain are likely to be taken up by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at its meeting tomorrow , but action will probably be deferred in pursuance of the " watchful waiting " policy now being followed by this government in relation to the European war . Conferences between rresment Roosevelt and Senator George , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , between Secretary Hull and Mr. George and between the Under-Secretary of State , Sumner Welles , and the Marquess of Lothian , British Ambassador , pointed to the prospect that this government would wait until after the turn of the new year before taking up any new proposals for British aid . Senator George said after meeting the President that his group would consider a resolution by Senator King removing the bans of the Johnson act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain and another by Senator Nye for an inquiry into the extent of British Empire financial resources in the United States , but he saw little or no chance for action on either at this session of Congress . Keeping a Quorum a Factor " I think it would be very , very difficult for a quorum of the committee or the Senate to be kept here for the closing days of this Congress to consider any controversial problem , " Senator George said . " And these measures undoubtedly ' present a controversial question . " Mr. George reflected a reluctance , apparent in both the legislative and executive branches , to tackle the British loan question at this time . One view is that the President and his advisers are awaiting further clarification of the popular support of British aid before proceeding ; another is that they are surveying the foreign situation from every possible angle , to try to determine when and in what form the British most need assistance , and to satisfy themselves as to whether the aid they seek will do the trick without involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the United States not only for financial aid , but for commercial and naval shipping and for the disposition of our own Navy to the end that theirs may be relieved as far as possible of patrol duty in some parts of the world in which they might confide their interests to us . Senator George said the matter of further aid to Great Britain was not discussed specifically in his conversation either with the President or with Secretary Hull . They went over general matters of foreign policy , he said , and found themselves " in general agreement " on major purposes . In response to questions , Mr. George said the Nye and King resolutions would be reached in routine order at tomorrow 's committee // U. S. WILL STUDY NEEDS OF BRITAIN // meeting and " given direction , " indicating that they would be re-ferred to subcommittees for study ' and report . After a conference with Under i Secretary Welles this noon , Lord Lothian asserted to reporters that I he had not submitted to President Roosevelt yesterday any memorandum asking for battleships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of such a memorandum was when he read a report about it in a newspaper today . He stressed that he had made no request , either in documentary or verbal form , for the warships mentioned in the published reports . Aid Group Prepared for Delay Sponsors of " all aid to FsritaA short of war " seemed reconciled to delay in the matter of financial assistance , but some of them questioned the opinion that the British should use ail their present Ameri ' can resources , both in the United States and Latin America , before seeking a loan here . To follow such a policy , it was argued , would mean that Britain would he unable to resume anything like normal trade relations with the Americas 1 with the restoration of peace . I All figures relating to holdings in 1 this hemisphere , particularly in Latin America , were said by these 1 friends of Britain to be only " nominal " and not representative of the true value of the assets involved . For instance , Latin-American British holdings have been listed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this amount is said to be represented by wholly nominal values on properties which have been operating with losses I over a period of years . It was further argued that the task of turning all of these holdings into cash would present a well-nigh insurmountable problem and would create , before it had advanced very far , a situation of " forced liquidation " which would run down the value of these assets , to the loss of the British and with probable large-scale financial dislocations in the countries in which they are located . Nevertheless , there is a body of opinion in the government which holds that as long as Great Britain has large holdings of securities and other assets in this country and in Latin America it would be difficult to persuade Congress that a loan should be granted of the size Britain would undoubtedly need if only to finance future war purchases in this country . There is some indication , moreover , that President Roosevelt himself is influenced by this view , or by the possible reaction to it in Congress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance .
