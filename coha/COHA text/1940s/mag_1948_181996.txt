Legionnaires were subdued . Suddenly and forcibly , they had been made to realize that their hooligan antics had ceased to amuse . The clincher was the problem of next year 's convention . Wailed a committeeman : " For the first time in our history , we have no bid from any city . " Nobody seemed to want the American Legion . <P> All week long , at their Miami convention , the Legion 's aging delegates were on their best behavior . Some 700 Legionnaires had been assigned to police duty to help keep order . If water pistols were flourished too carelessly , they were seized . Electric canes were appropriated on sight . Fat and fiftyish , the average delegate spent his time forlornly window-shopping with his wife , listening to assorted oratory . He perked up enough to review the lissome candidates for " Miss Majorette of America for 1948 , " voted Illinois ' Mary Jean Peterson fairest of them all . But the big , 5-hour parade was marred by a drenching rain . <P> Long Live the King . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates , fewer still among the 30,000 other Legionnaires who came along for the fun-although they outnumber World War I veterans two to one among the Legion 's 3,000,000 members . In the battle to elect next year 's commander , the old-guard " king makers " squelched a rebellion by the younger veterans , steamrolled serenely on to victory with stocky , bespectacled S. Perry Brown , 56 , veteran of both wars and general manager of a Beaumont , Tex . building-materials company . It was n't even close . <P> But if the Legion 's unofficial comportment was sober , its official conduct was the most irresponsible in years . After voting resolutions favoring U.M.T. a veto-less U.N. , and public housing for veterans , the delegates kicked over the traces . <P> Over the committee leadership 's protests , they directed members of their Americanism committee to appoint themselves as educational vigilantes , to keep close watch on the nation 's teachers . In teaching the differences between U.S. democracy and " the Communist dictatorship , " the resolution stated firmly , " our system must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next day the aging warriors voted themselves a bonanza . They whipped through a resolution which called for pensions to all World War I veterans and their dependents equivalent to those paid Spanish-American War veterans ( $90 a month after 65 ) . Then they passed another asking pensions for veterans of both wars-$60 a month at 55 , $75 a month after 65 . Such laws would add more than $1 billion to the federal budget right away ; by 1985 , when the average World War II veteran is 55 or older , it would cost more than $8 billion a year . <P> But the Legionnaires ' outward sobriety had paid off . Philadelphia sent along a belated bid for next year 's convention . And at week 's end , a surprised , pleased and unscratched Miami extended a warm invitation to return again next year-in fact , every year , if they liked . <P>
