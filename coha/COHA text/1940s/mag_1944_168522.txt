A young ( 45 ) , blue-eyed Swede named Gunnar Myrdal landed in the U.S. in 1938 to make a fresh , thorough and impartial study of American Negroes . After five years of research , assisted by a staff of some 75 Carnegie Corporation-financed helpers , Sweden 's Myrdal found that his whole ambitious project hinged on one simple question : " What goes on in the minds of white Americans ? " Last week he published his complex , 1,483-page answer , called it An American Dilemma : the Negro Problem and Modern Democracy ( Harper ; 2 vols. ; $7.50 ) . <P> Economist-Senator Myrdal was chosen by Carnegie 's trustees to make this major American study because he was 1 ) an able scholar , 2 ) not an American , and thus could look at Negroes with an " entirely fresh mind . " Perhaps not since de Tocqueville and Bryce has the U.S. had such an analytical probing by a sharp-eyed foreigner . Sifting a mountain of documentation through a trained academic mind , Dr. Myrdal drew conclusions that will make U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he concludes , is grim but not hopeless . It " represents nothing more and nothing less than a century-long lag of public morals . In principle , the Negro problem was settled long ago ; in practice , the solution is not effectuated . The Negro in America has not yet been given the elemental civil and political rights of formal democracy . . . . This anachronism constitutes the contemporary ' problem . ' . . . " <P> The White Mind . " America is continuously struggling for its soul . . . . The American . . . is strongly and sincerely ' against sin , ' even , and not least , his own sins . He investigates his faults , puts them on record , and shouts them from the housetops , adding the most severe recriminations against himself . . . . Americans accuse themselves , and are accused by others , of being materialists . But they are equally extreme in the other direction . . . . This young nation is the least cynical of all nations . " <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a brand-new law every time it has a twinge of conscience . The nation 's laws are too hastily written , and then their effect is lost or diluted by sloppy or inadequate administration . As a result , a highly moral country paradoxically looks on all law &; order with suspicion and mild contempt . <P> The U.S. Future . The U.S. has now abandoned isolationism and has " joined the world . . . America feels itself to be humanity in miniature . When in this crucial time the international leadership passes to America , the great reason for hope is that this country has a national experience of uniting racial and cultural diversities-and a national theory , if not a consistent practice , of freedom and equality for all . . . . In this sense , the Negro problem is not only America 's greatest failure but also America 's incomparably great opportunity for the future . . . . "
