In his marble Algiers mansion General Henri Giraud , Allied protege , waited vainly for Allied help . He had not " accepted " General Charles de Gaulle 's decree removing him as Commander in Chief . Now word came that the Gaullist Government had retired him , at full pay to the " reserve command list . " Old Soldier Giraud saw that the fight was lost . To his troops he bade a dignified farewell : " Men pass , but France is eternal . " <P> Rumor said that he would go to London to write his memoirs : the story of a Frenchman who had fought from the Atlas to the Vosges , seen the inside of German prisons in two wars , dreamed once of leading la patrie 's liberation . <P> Take Care , De Gaulle . Never had Charles de Gaulle ridden so high . His government had liquidated the most vexing symbol of Allied intervention in French affairs . It was accepted by the Allied High Command as the authority for the France that would be liberated . From London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaulle to talk problems of civil administration . <P> Gaullists were happy over the tide of events . But Frenchmen of other sympathy were troubled . In the Algiers Consultative Assembly , Communists and others did not like General de Gaulle 's highhanded disposal of General Giraud , worried over his program for liberated France . A striking parallel developed between the extreme Left and the extreme Right among French refugees : both camps warned De Gaulle and the world that Frenchmen in France will determine the fate of France . <P> Pundit Walter Lippmann sharply analyzed U.S. policy toward France : <P> " The President wanted General Eisen hower to pick and choose the Frenchmen with whom he would deal when he got to France . This incredibly dangerous proposal has had its repercussions in the . . . quarrel between General de Gaulle and General Giraud . The reasoning of the French at Algiers is self-evident : ... It will ... be not the French Committee but . . . the French Commander in Chief who will tell General Eisenhower what Frenchmen to deal with . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of civil affairs in France , General Giraud must be deposed . . . . <P> " Thus Mr. Roosevelt 's desire to thwart General de Gaulle has led to the destruction of General Giraud and new divisions rather than greater unity among the French . This is inefficiency in the conduct of diplomacy . "
