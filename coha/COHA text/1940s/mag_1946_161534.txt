OPA was dead ; dead as a doornail . All price ceilings were off-a state of affairs the U.S. people had not known for more than four and a half years . No matter if Congress did backtrack and restore a few , OPA was over and done with . <P> The news was variously received . Some cried woe and others hallelujah . Those who cried woe saw abysmal inflation ahead , chaos , the ruination of the nation 's economy . Those who cried hallelujah said , in effect : okay , this is going to be all right ; we 're just going to do things the way we always did them in peacetime . <P> What was a plain citizen to think ? He was worried and anxious . What was going to happen to him now ? Was he suddenly going to have to pay twice as much for everything ? Should he strike for higher pay ? If everybody else put prices up he 'd have to put his up too . <P> What it seemed to boil down to was fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fellow-was going to do . Maybe everybody would now try to make a killing . And then again , maybe he would n't . The U.S. people , at bottom , have a great deal of common sense . Now they would be called upon to use it .
