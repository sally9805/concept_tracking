TIME 'S Nanking Correspondent Frederick Gruin returned from the recaptured Kalgan area convinced that Chinese Communists ' defeats have more than military significance , that the Reds may have undermined their own guerrilla potential . His report : <P> <P> The " new democracy " practiced by China 's Communists in the strategic northwest , vacated by the Japanese more than a year ago , has seemingly ended in a political mistake rivaling their military failure . This is a conclusion hard to escape after a strenuous plane , truck and rail tour of the Chahar Shansi-Suiyuan border region . <P> Smashed Window . In this area , the economic plexus centering on Kalgan , the Japs built and left largely intact an ambitious and forward-looking economic plant . The Communists fell heir to the prize , which served them as a powerful corridor between Yenan and Manchuria and a " show window " of policy for all the nation . Not only did they fail to defend this area militarily , but as they fell back before the Government armies they kicked in the show window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needy as China . <P> Three weeks after the Communist evacuation , Kalgan was still without electric lights , telephones , running water . The railyards were a graveyard of charred trains and dynamited workers ' dormitories . On one street they named " Liberation , " the retreating Communists set fire to the post office . Across the way , they reduced the telephone exchange ( servicing 4,000 lines ) to a pile of splintered glass and twisted wire . In the city 's outskirts , they did a first-class wrecker job on a power plant . Besides crippling communications , the Reds wrecked 52 Kalgan factories ( including flour , match , soap , and soy-bean sauce ) , depriving families of 3,000 workers of their livelihood . <P> " Temporary Hardship . " Ten miles outside of Tatung , a city of 80,000 that withstood a 45-day Communist siege , lie the Kouchuan coal mines and power plant-one of the biggest enterprises of its kind in North China . The Communists took Kouchuan last August , were driven out Oct. 31 after a mild skirmish . They left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops ruined , foundries and lathes demolished , burned-out roundhouses full of burned-out locomotives , hand tools and hardware broken and scattered in the dust . <P> This Chinese scorching of the Chinese earth has decreased the value of the conquered cities to the victors , but it has also provided them with a ready-made excuse if suffering this winter can not be alleviated . Although the Communists politically justify all such destruction as a temporary hardship , temporary has become a sour word to Chinese sick of nine years of war . The immediate effect appears to be a loss of the popular support the Communists would need for guerrilla fighting . <P> Change of Heart . In the prisoners ' barbed-wire stockade at Kalgan there was further evidence of a historic military phenomenon : the diminishment of morale among even the best soldiers when the road ahead is an ever steepening , rock-strewn patch , the enemy one 's own people . For eight years , since he was 17 , Wang Yu-ming had fought with the Communists ' famed Eighth Route Army , had risen from the ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four wounds in battles with the Japanese .
