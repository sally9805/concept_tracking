New Yorkers love a good crime story . They also dote on stories about people with big wads of money . They also like stories about what people do when they manage-as most New Yorkers never do - to break out of their humdrum , nickel-nursing lives . Last week they got all three kinds of story rolled into one . <P> First there was a guy in a humdrum cashier 's job who managed to steal more than $800,000 in a little more than a year . He was a bland , nice-looking fellow with a black mustache , who had worked all his adult life ( 22 years ) in a nickels- &-dimes; job with a big outfit-the Mergenthaler Linotype Co. , over in Brooklyn . It was funny the way they happened to find out about the big embezzlement ; a clerk got nosy about a check paid out to an unfamiliar company and first thing you know they find a lot of bogus checks . And then when they look for the trusted cashier , he 's gone . But he has a great name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What they discover at William Arthur Nickel 's unpretentious house out in Freeport , L.I . is plenty . He has a pert dark-haired wife , who is very photogenic . She has two mink coats and a pile of jewelry - about $40,000 worth . And she also has a big , beautiful wad of money-$83,000 . Well , they begin digging into Nickel 's life and he comes up as a slightly different kind of embezzler , not a racetrack , nightclubbing type . He wanted to live like a solid , rich citizen . <P> Shady Men . There was a big motorboat and a little motorboat , $20,000 worth of antiques for a big suburban house he 'd put a down payment on , and he 'd bought some lots and put up $40,000 for an apartment on Manhattan 's upper East Side . Not until the night he fled did he tell his wife where all the money came from . <P> Of course , they find Nickel ( minus mustache ) down at Miami Beach and he tells them all about how he worked it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drew checks to cover the amounts , cashed the checks himself . <P> But the dicks are wary . They figure one man ca n't do all this without some help . So Nickel spills it , and out come some shady Broadway characters . One is a sharpie named Isidore Rappaport , who is supposed to have thought up the deal , and one is an ex-convict named Kupsnecker , who runs a check-cashing office . <P> By then it begins to look as if Nickel is maybe just a sucker-that the sharp boys maybe got the most of what he stole . Did n't he even have a dame or get some fun out of it ? The old reliable , crime-thumping Daily News had the answer for that one . The News found out that Nickel kept a Broadway hotel suite , which was stocked with nylons and Scotch , and was handy for blondes . He gave $20 tips . <P> So the story stood this week , with Nickel on his way back from Miami with the cops . New Yorkers could hardly wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be good for a long time .
