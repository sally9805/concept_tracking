In 1909 , when he was 17 , he entered the guttural , drill-sharp barrack routine of the German Imperial Army . Then came the four grey years of World War I. After that Germany was a shambles of street fighting , depression , inflation . For flat-nosed , flabby-faced Theodor Eicke , the world was horrible ; the only meaning in it was to claw his way over the others and reach the top of the muck heap . <P> Eicke joined Hitler in 1921 , became Standartenjiihrer of the Palatinate Storm Troops . Later he helped found the fanatically brutal , black-shirted SS . In 1932 , when he was caught trying to assassinate a democratic politician , he fled to Italy . When Hitler came into power , Eicke came home to head the SS Death 's Head Brigade-the guards who tortured into pulp the minds and bodies of anti-Nazi Germans in the new concentration camps . Eicke was warden of Dachau , and there he was in his element : he meted out the most indecent punishments himself . <P> In France and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an Elite Guard armored-infantry Division . Last week a Russian bullet returned Obergruppenfuhrer Theodor Eicke to the muck .
