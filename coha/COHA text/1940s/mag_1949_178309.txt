The late Rachel Kollock McDowell , longtime ( 28 years ) religious news editor of the New York Times , was known to her more irreverent colleagues as " the lady bishop . " In the hope of making news men " swear off swearing , " she founded the Pure Language League , tried to get fellow staffers to sign pledges against cussing . Even in death Miss McDowell carried on her good fight . Her will , probated last week , left about $3,000 to the New York Newspaper Guild ( of which she was not a member ) to perpetuate the Pure Language League by distributing pamphlets . Said the Guild 's Executive Vice President Tom Murphy : " Well , we 've got the money , but I do n't know what the hell we 're going to do with it . "
