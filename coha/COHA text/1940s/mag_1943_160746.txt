You could have knocked Frank Hague over with a split ballot . In his 26 years as Mayor of Jersey City , he had done more than his bit to establish himself as the U. S. 's prime suppressor of civil liberties . His hired thugs made an almost ceremonial fox hunt out of chasing labor organizers and , especially , Communists out of town . Now the Communists swore they loved him . The U. S. press laughed itself silly . <P> This stunning turnabout was official . William Norman , executive secretary of the New Jersey Communist Party , made the statement in the Daily Worker , Manhattan 's mouthpiece for the U. S. Communist Party . Cooed he : " . . . Outworn conceptions , if carried over to other historical periods , can prove of incalculable harm to the cause of progress and the chief issue today , the nation 's war . Such a misconception continues to exist with regard to Frank Hague and so-called Hagueism . . . . " <P> The reasoning behind the Worker 's sudden affection for Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt , who is winning the war . New Jersey will choose a new governor next fall and he must be a Democrat , to silence the " copperheads " and " labor defeatists " who are angry with the President . And Boss Hague is still the boss of New Jersey in 1943 , as he was in 1940 . <P> Hague was so flabbergasted that he could only mutter through his jowls : " I do n't know anything about it . " Grumbled bat-eared Michael J. Quill , head of the Transportation Workers Union , himself often tagged with a Red label : " Hague is a bum and always was a bum , and I do n't think you can whitewash him just because he says he supports the war .
