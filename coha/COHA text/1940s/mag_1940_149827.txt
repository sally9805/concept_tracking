Last week Wendell Willkie was at Jupiter Island , Fla. , sleeping , reading , basking , bicycling for exercise . He had not yet helped the Republican Party solve the problem of who would be its national chairman for the next four years . Whether he would try to keep Representative Joe Martin in the job or let the post pass to the hands of some willing party hack was a question still in suspense . Columnist David Lawrence , in his United States News , seized the moment to make a wholly unorthodox suggestion . <P> Traditionally , the chairman of the national committee is expected to do little between elections except raise money and hold the party together . State research bureaus grow moldy , contact between national and State party headquarters virtually ends , party headquarters settle down to the long , slow snores of their political hibernation . Worst of all , leadership of the party as a whole ceases to exist . Said David Lawrence : " It is not likely that the Republican Party will win a national election in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in three and a half months what an incumbent administration , possessed of the power of publicity and funds , can do in three and a half years . . . . Impressions and prejudices for or against parties and their candidates are deeply set long before a national convention picks a candidate . It is the work done between elections that accounts for enough votes to constitute the balance of power . " <P> For these reasons David Lawrence picked his own candidate for chairman of the Republican National Committee : no less a person than Wendell Willkie himself . <P> No candidate for President ever took such a job afterwards . But Columnist Lawrence pointed out its advantage to Willkie and the party : 1 ) he would have a powerful voice in party leadership ; 2 ) he could acquire closer familiarity with national affairs , bring efficiency and planning to the national headquarters ; 3 ) party leadership developed in conferences could be effective inside as well as outside Congress , could prevent contradictions like those that made the Republican record on defense and foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive ( " It ought to pay a man as much as does the Presidency " ) , Mr. Willkie could make speeches , stimulate party organization and " become the most constructive minority voice the country has ever known . " <P> If unorthodox Campaigner Willkie should take the job proposed , the U. S. would see something new under the political sun . Last week he got off his bicycle and flew to Manhattan to speak at the National Interfraternity Conference , urge a higher standard of political debate , ask greater aid to Great Britain ( " We must continue to help the fighting men of Britain to preserve that rim of freedom which is gradually shrinking and which , if we permit it to continue to shrink , will shrink to the edge of our own shores " ) . But at week 's end he was still mum on the subject of the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee .
