The hairy ears of the cannoneers of the Panama Coast Artillery Command are due to burn this week . Into them will be poured ( Thursday , 8:30 to 9 p.m . E.D.S.T. ) a booming salute from NBC . From Manhattan they will be greeted by their old commander , Major General Sanderford Jarman , by NBC President Niles Trammell , by Gertrude Lawrence , many another . Then from their own tiny stations , PCAN and PCAC , in the Canal Zone , their new topkick , Major General William E. Shedd , and Brigadier General Glen E. Edgerton , Governor of the Zone , will make reply . <P> First time in history such aerial whoop-de-do has been made over a branch of the U.S. Army , the program came into being as a consequence of the activities of ebullient Master Sergeant Clay Doster , editor of the slaphappy Panama Coast Artillery News ( TIME , June 9 ) . Few months ago Sergeant Doster was given the tough job of getting some good radio shows for minuscule PCAN and PCAC , which provide four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the lonely Panama jungles . <P> Lacking funds , Entrepreneur Doster appealed to NBC for help . Forthwith C. Lloyd Egner , head of NBC 's radio-recording division , got together a ton of top-flight recordings , dispatched them to the Zone . Among them went a series of recordings made especially for the Jungleers by Actress Lawrence , now an honorary Jungle-Mudder , 1st Class . <P> Meantime NBC 's Press Chief Bill Kostka decided that the next logical move was to tell the world about NBC and the Panama Coast Artillery . So this week NBC will tie the facilities of its Blue network via telephone line to a tiny 50-watt transmitter in the post gymnasium at Fort Amador , C.Z. , advertise the fact that PCAN and PCAC are now its protgs.
