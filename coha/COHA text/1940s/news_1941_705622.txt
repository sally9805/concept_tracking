txt Topics of The Times Once upon a time , in any 10,000 part of the United States the Per reader may prefer  --  for the Cent tale is imaginary , though founded on hard fact  --  the owner of a small factory closed the year 's operations with a net profit of $2.50 . The owner was not exactly exhilarated , but he was not too unhappy , because the preceding year h.1 had ended up with a net loss of $2,150.60 . Now if things kept up the way they were going he could look forward to a really good year ahead . And in fact his hopes were justified . The following year he actually showed a profit of $1,800 . Thereupon a representative of the labor union came forward in public and accused him of having boosted his profits 72,000 per cent . Contrary to the practice of most fiction writers , who arc careful to state right at the beginning that their story has no connection with any real person or any real happening , we do not hesitate to confess how our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It came from the labor leader who has called a strike against a logging company . He declares that the company 's profits this year show an increase of 43,000 per cent . Percentages are a When good servant but a bad Percentage master . In this place Helps yesterday an examination of Nazi bombs over British churches and homes involved the use of percentages and fractions . For a true picture it is obvious that we can not speak of a thousand British churches destroyed without noting that it maybe only 1 or 2 per cent of all British churches . When 70,000 bombed British dwellings are repaired it is proper to mention that Great Britain probably has 10,000,000 separate dwellings , which brings us down again to 1 or 2 per cent . But on the other When hand , if , let us say , a Percentage young lawyer or docLies tor who has just hung out his shingle earns $10 the first year and $1,200 the second year , it rather distorts the picture to say that his annual income has increased 12,000 per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year income had been only $1 , as has been known to happen to young doctors and lawyers , then the increase next year would have been 120,000 per cent . But it would n't mean that our young professional was looking about for a moderate-sized private yacht . One interesting feature is that people quoting unjustifiable profits are not content to say that a business man 's income or a corporation 's income has been multiplied 1,200 times , which ought to be outrageous enough . The critics are out for all the impact which the statistics will bear and insist on making it 120,000 per cent . Obviously a 120,000 times profit increase is more heinous than a 1,200 times profit . Needless to say , a very modBig est percentage , in actual figRelief ures , can stand for a very big Drop thing . Against the monumental profit increase of 43,000 per cent discussed in the preceding paragraphs , how insignificant is a modest 56 per cent of anything ? That was the very humble figure in the headlines the other day . It seems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the number of persons on relief last year had declined by very nearly 56 per ' cent . In concrete figures it means a drop of about 210,000 relief families or about 825,000 persons . It means that in 1935 one person in every five was on relief in New York City , and in 1940 it was one person in every twenty . The money saving was about $16,000,000 a month . All this was tucked away in a modest little 56 per cent , almost hidden in the rest of the headline  --  nearly a quarter of a million families , more than threequarters of a million men , women and Children , approximately $200,000,000 a year . A cut of more than half in Big the number of people on reSocial lief must impress the averGain age person as registering a social gain of very large proportions . Yet at the recent national conference of social workers there were mixed feelings on the subject . To the extent that a cut in WPA support may not have been completely justified by the rise in employment or may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter that requires looking into . But there was not wanting at the conference the suggestion that any downward revision of relief funds is in itself a bad thing . It comes close to tampering with social protection . It is another phase of the general threat to " social gains " concerning which a good many people are anxious , prematurely as we others see it , and at a time when there are much more immediate dangers and duties at hand . And especially why so Wages much worry about our imReplace periled social gains when ' Dole we have just registered a social gain of such enormous dimensions ? To cut unemployment in half , to bring back millions of workers from dependency to self-support strikes one as a social gain compared with which gains in hours and wages become quite secondary . Provided , that is , one still holds that basic wages are always better than relief , even when relief is called " security . "                    @
