It was doubtful whether Kirsten Flagstad 's great voice would ever again be heard in the U.S. In her native Norway , 49-year-old Soprano Flagstad was an unrespected citizen . Norwegians regard their fellow countrymen as either politically allgood or all-bad ( everyone either collaborated with the Nazis or worked underground against them ) - and most Norwegians are convinced that Flagstad was more loyal to her quisling husband than to her country . Now , as her husband frets in jail , she has found little encouragement from the U.S. ; the Metropolitan 's Edward Johnson has said : " I see no reason for her re-engagement. "
