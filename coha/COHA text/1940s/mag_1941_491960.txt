YOU would think that any place with a name like Moose Jaw , Saskatchewan , would be a frontier outpost on the last geographical fringes of civilization , but , as a matter of fact , it 's an alert and modern town in the center of the Canadian prairie country . Here , in late summer , the bird-dog men gather for the first major field trial of the season . Because Moose Jaw is the opener , and breaks a summer of hard work on the lone prairee , the occasion is mildly festive , and the hotel lobby is crowded with wealthy dog owners and their wives , local sportsmen , the trainers and the judges , all talking about bird dogs . But every now and then you see the odd hit , as the Canadians say , of gloom ; and this comes when one dog trainer asks another dog trainer about his prospects . The kennels of Ed Mack Farrior and V. E. Humphreys and Earl Crangle were in a pitiable state , to hear them tell one another about it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up just to lie with the crowd - Farrior , who had Crooked Creek Jake , a young fireball pointer just getting hot ; Crangle , who had Hillbright Susanna , a tiny , hustling dog anxious to prove herself the best setter on the major circuit ; and Humphreys , who had Young 's Billie , the dug that , the Friday following , won the Saskatchewan championship . Dogs like these , and like Lester 's Enjoy 's Wahooson of Enjoy , owned by Doctor Lester , in case you 're wondering about that jawhreaker name  --  and Farm-wood Traveler and Surracho are the highest development of the bird dog . Their owners pay the trainers twenty-five dollars a month per dog , pay the trial entry fees fifty dollars or so  --  and give the trainers whatever purses the dogs win . The owner 's share is pride of possession . But he is n't getting the short end of the stick . He 's willing to spend an unlimited amount to he able to point out a field-trial champion and say , " That 's my dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include any dog trainers . The owner could perhaps get additional value fur his money in watching his field-trial dog in 1 he formative period . Of no other sporting animal is so much required . Greyhounds and horses simply run , retrievers retrieve , hounds follow their noses , gamecocks fight . A field-trial dog 's training begins at six weeks of age ; by the time he is three years old he should have begun to reach a finished state of development . Then , when he enters a trial , here 's what he 's supposed to do : run big ? meaning at a good distance a half mile or so  --  ahead of the handler ? without getting lost ; he must also run fast and jauntily throughout the one to three hours of the heat . He must use initiative and judgment in hunting hirdy places , and yet handle easily . He must locate game decisively , and point with intensity and style , and honor another dog 's point upon sight . And finally , he must he steady to wing and shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun fired into the air ; the birds are n't killed  --  and the handler commands him to get going again . You can see that a dog would n't learn all that in one day . Neither does he learn it in one place . Most field-trial trainers are located in the South . But when summer comes , the Southern woods and fields are hot and rattlesnake-infested ; and the trainer , with several assistants , forty-odd dogs , saddles , clothing and miscellaneous equipment , travels 2000 miles to work his dogs on the rolling prairies of Southern Saskatchewan or Manitoba . Here the game is plentiful , there are no venomous snakes , at least the early part of every day is cool , and the country is wide open enough to invite a pointer or setter to go his doggonedest . At the camp of Ed Mack Farrior , outside the village of Forget pronounced " forjay " ? breakfast is by lamplight . The camp personnel consists of Houston Nichols , Farrior 's assistant from Alabama , and Gordon Dunk , the Canadian , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Farriors train for fifteen years ; John D. , - his son ; Oscar , the wagon driver ; y and Man , the cook . By the time breakfast is over , the . Negroes have the dog wagons ready and the horses saddled , and forty-three noisy dogs leap ecstatically shout the pens , each trying to state that he would like to hunt this morning and , if chosen , would show some really extraordinary bird-dog work . Finally the two outfits are loaded and drive out , one turning north , one east . followed by a prolonged chorus of brokenhearted howling from the dogs who are left behind . The first dog to go down is Jake . In the dew-wet early morning , his feet are smeared with a protective coating of tar his " travelin ' shoes , " Johnny Hooks says -- and then he is turned loose . A few weeks ago , Jake was just a fair-going dog , but lately something has happened to him  --  something that happens often to dogs on the prairies ; he 's simply taken it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half mile away , a spot of swift-1 moving white against the yellow mustard . His ground-eating speed electrifies the men , and each responds in his own idiom . " Lookit the bloody thing move ! " says the Canadian . " Yes , suh , " agrees Johnny , " ole Jake is mho vappin ' ! He 's cut him a long walkin ' stick dis day ! " Jake 's run even stirs the unexcitable Farrior , who in his twenty-eight years has seen many first-class dogs , one of which , Air Pilot 's Sam  --  national champion in 1937 and one of the best dogs that ever lived ? he raised and trained . Farrior went to college to become an engineer . But after finishing , the call of the fields got him , and like his father  --  who has now quit field-trial campaigning for the comparative quiet of game-preserve management  --  he became a bird-dog man . " Look a-yonder ! He 's got ' ern , Mr. Eddie Mack ! " calls Johnny , pointing to ( Continued on Page 631 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store that New Salem 's first post office was opened on Christmas Day , 1829 , with Hill as postmaster . One story is that Hill gave so much attention to the liquor trade and so little to the mail that the women of the settlement petitioned for his discharge and the appointment of Lincoln . In any case , Andrew Jackson , a Democrat , named Lincoln , a Whig , as postmaster , in 1833 , and Lincoln ran the post office in Hill 's store until the office was suspended in 1836 . On Lincoln 's Birthday last year Postmaster General Farley reopened the post office after 104 years , this time as " Lincoln 's New Salem , " which cancellation appears on the tourists ' post cards . Collectors poured 35,000 pieces of mail through the little office that day for first-day cancellations . Lincoln 's fees as postmaster for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 1815 , were $55.70 , but the mail came only once a week . In a speech before an Association of National Advertisers convention recently , Roy E. Larsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln trudged miles to borrow books , he could n't have borrowed magazines in that day because there were none in the region to be had . New Salem 's Literature Mr. Larsen was wrong in this . In their researches for their forthcoming book , Abe Lincoln and His First Partner , Robert Barton and Zarel Spears were unable to trace the number and kind of periodicals which passed through New Salem 's post office in Lincoln 's time . They did , however , find the records of the Jacksonville post office , only thirty-five mites distant and not then so much larger . No less than 133 periodicals were received on subscription at the Jacksonville post office in 1835 . Fifty-four were religious papers . The Louisville Public Advertiser , a Jacksonian organ , was the most widely read newspaper , with twenty-two subscribers . Among secular magazines , The Saturday Evening the distant patch of buffalo willow that almost hides the immobile Jake . Instantly the little training caravan is galvanized into action , with the horsemen spurring their mounts into a dead run across the **30;1792;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to dig dem gophers out , " Johnny Hooks says . " He just blow his bref down de gopher hole , and de gopher got to come out . " ) The wagon follows , rocketing and bouncing , with the shaken dogs howling and fighting in the excitement . Farrior 's horse plows to a stop , and the trainer is off and runs to where Crooked Creek Jake stands on a lofty and stylish point . Incidentally , as to bird-dog style , the important thing about a point is intensity ; the ideal point is erect , with head up and the tail above the level of the dog 's back  --  the higher the better . Some people think a cautiously lifted front paw is the sine qua non of bird-dog style , but a good dog is supposed to be bold and positive , not cautious ; you see the raised forepaw on calendars , not often at field trials . Farrior runs in front of the dog , quirting the sage and buffalo willow , Post had five subscribers , Godey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no magazines to read in New Salem . It is probable that Lincoln distributed The Post to one or two subscribers . CCC labor , Federal grants and the aid of the National Park Service , acting in conjunction with state departments , have made possible the recreation of outbuildings , rail fences , well heads , gardens and such touches as the translated stumps , greatly aiding the illusion of time turned back . They have made possible , too , roads , bridges , parking areas , trails and shelters outside the village but in the state park , now grown to 225 acres . Below the village , at the foot of the hill , is the Wagon Wheel restaurant , designed in 1830 style , built by the park authorities and leased and supervised by the state . The furnishings of the restored village include more than five hundred contemporary books , a far greater library , than Lincoln ever saw until he went to Springfield . Lincoln and Ann Rutledge studied together a copy of the 1828 edition of Samuel Kirkham 's grammar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Rutledge is now learning grammar . " That identical volume now is in the Library of Congress , but a copy of the 1830 edition is preserved at New Salem . From this grammar Lincoln propounded to Ann the Kirkham definition of a phrase as " an assemblage of words not constituting an entire proposition , but performing a distinct office in the structure of a sentenceor of another phrase . " Curiously , New Salem 's copy of the fifth edition of William Cullen Bryant 's poems ( 1839 ) does not contain his The Painted Cup , in which is to lie found the first known mention of the Sangamon in literature . Bryant had seen the river while on a journey to visit his brothers at Jacksonville and Princeton , Illinois ; and he wrote in 1833 : The fresh sarannas of the Sangamon Here rise in gentle swells , and the long grass PRAIRIE DOGS ( Continued from Page I8 ) and eight scattered prairie chickens burst into the air with indignant squawks . The impatient Juke makes a leap forward , but Farrior " squalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trainer guiltily . Ed Mack makes him stand for a moment , then gives him an encouraging slap on the ribs and Jake is gone again , with flying feet and merry tail . Thirty minutes later , the next dog called from the wagon is Surracho . His name , properly spelled " Sirocco , " means a hot wind , and is somewhat apt , for this rangy goose-necked painter is a fast and fiery bird dog . Last year he was a winner as a derby two-year-old ; he is as deadly on game as any backwoodsman 's meat dog , and no dog makes more stylish , breath-taking points . But for the chicken trials this year Surracho is out with a sore foot . Farrior leaves the lemon pointer down only a few minutes . But even in that time Surracho has reached a bluff ? willow and white poplar patch  --  and pointed . " Look at do ole fool puttin ' it on , " Johnny grins . Farrior flushes the birds and fires into the air and Surracho stands there Is mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green Like flashes of fire ; The wanderers of the prairie know them well , And call the brilliant flower the Painted Cup . When Lincoln left New Salem finally in 1837 , he rode a borrowed horse , everything he owned , including his law books , contained in two saddlebags . His first stop in Springfield was at a cabinetmaker 's to order a single bedstead . His second was at Joshua F. Speed 's store . Speed left his own account of their first meeting . Dissipating a $17 Gloom " He came into my store , set his saddlebags on the counter and inquired what the furnishings for a single bedstead would cost , " Speed wrote . " I took a slate and pencil , made a calculation and found the sum for furnishings complete would amount to seventeen dollars . Said he : ' It probably is cheap enough , but I want to say that , cheap as it is , I have not the money to pay ; but if you will credit me until Christmas , and if my experiment here as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . If I fail in that I probably never will pay you at all . ' " The tone of his voice was so melancholy that I felt for him . I looked up at him and I thought then as I think now that I never saw so gloomy and melancholy a face in my life . 1 said to him : ' So small a debt seems to affect you so deeply , I think I can suggest a plan by which you can attain your end without incurring any debt . I have a very large room with a very large double bed in it , which you are perfectly welcome to share with me if you choose . ' ' Where is your room ! ' he asked . I pointed . Without saying a word , he took his saddlebags on his arm , went upstairs , set them on the floor , came down again , and with a face beaming with pleasure and smiles exclaimed : ' Well , Speed , I 'm moved . ' " That was the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock . Johnny lifts the dog and carries him to the wagon , where the healing pad of his foot is treated with flexible collodion . Surracho 's owner , W. F. Miller , has never seen his dog work , and only through Ed Mack Farrior 's thoroughgoing sense of honor does he happen to own him . His father having been a bird-dog man , Miller wanted to acquire a field-trial dog simply for sentimental reasons , and asked Farrior to sell him the likeliest-looking puppy he had . On the day the check for $300 arrived , Miller 's brand-new dog died . Farrior offered to return the check . " Or , " he wrote , " I have another puppy that may make a good dog . I 'll give you this one for yours that died , if you prefer . " Miller agreed to the second suggestion , and the dog he got is Surracho , now in his first all-age year , one of the class dogs of the major campaigners . Another pistol ball of a dog who changed owners is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known in the kennel , Dot . About three years ! ago I saw this dog run in the amateur puppy  --  under one year old ( Continued on Page 65 ) ( Continued from Page 679 stake , as a brace mate for her litter sister , who had drawn a bye . Puppies are not required to handle birds , they 're simply required to run well ; h but Jeanette found birds and pointed them steadily , and Dot , coming upon the scene , instantly honored the point . Last year the brace was broken when Jeanette died under a truck . Dot 's pedigree name , then , was Sealey 's Momoney Dot , and she belonged to Bob Sealey , of Donaldsonville , Georgia , who used her principally as a hunting dog . As far as Sealey was concerned , Dot was God 's best job in the bird-dog line . That also went for M. G. Dudley , of Greenville , South Carolina , who had bred the puppies . On every occasion he badgered Bob Sealey to sell him Dot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dudley said in desperation . His own vocal cords having been removed by an operation for cancer of the throat , he talks quite plainly with an artificial larynx . " I 'll give you a thousand dollars for Dot . " " No , I do n't want to sell her , " Sealey replied . " And I 've been offered fifteen hundred for her anyway . " Dudley mulled this over a day or two . Finally he concluded that Sealey would not be persuaded by any normal approach to sell Dot , and he decided to use strategy . Susanna Changes Owners He visited Sealey 's hotel room , innocently accompanied by a witness , and he said , " Bob , I 'll make you a final proposition . I want Dot , and I 'll strain a point to get her . I 'll give you fifteen hundred dollars for her . You kl ought to give me the option , since she 's from my Hillbright kennels . " " No soap . " Dudley sighed . " Just out of curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Sealey , thinking to discourage Dudley for all time , said airily , " Oh , I 'll sell her for twenty-five hundred dollars . " " Sold ! " said Dudley instantly , and whipped out his checkbook , while Sealey blanched with horror at what he had done . So now Dot 's name on the books is Hillbright Susanna , and she has been steadied by Earl Crangle into a first-class field-trial dog , all thirty pounds of her . The next dogs that are taken from the Farrior dog wagon are elevenmonths-old puppies . They hit the prairie with joyful yelps , streaking through the prairie grass and mustard , eager for something to chase . One of them bursts into a covey of Hungarian partridges and sends them hell ascattering . Presently the other one jumps a big jackrabbit . The jack gallops away with the puppy in frantic pursuit . " Shucks , " Johnny says , " that ole rabbit ai n't halfway runnin ' . Ai n't even got his years laid back yit . " Bird-dog puppies have a terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid food , a pistol is shot over them at mealtime , so that they associate the firing with something enjoyable ; that way , they wo n't be gun-shy later . Their next training is in the yard , where they are taught to come at command , to retrieve , and to stop at command . But afield they can do as they please . They can chase deer , jackrabbits , coyotes or birds . During this wild and gay period , the love of hunting becomes deeply rooted . Furthermore , an intelligent dog will begin to learn such things as the proper use of a downwind , and that prairie chickens are often to be found in wolf-willow patches , in bluffs , around old buffalo wallows ; that only gophers inhabit bald prairie ground . Then one day the puppy finds a collar around his neck with a check cord attached . He attaches no importance to this slight encumbrance , and joyfully begins bird hunting . When the hot scent of the first covey burns his nostrils , he pauses in an instinctive flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens squawking everywhere . This time , though , he hears a sharp " Whoa ! " The young dog knows what that means , but perhaps thinks , " To heck with him ! I took orders in the yard , but out here it 's different ! There 're birds right ahead ! " And he leaps forward  --  only to be suddenly jolted to a stop by the check cord . " By gum , " the dog thinks ruefully , " I believe he meant it . " He 's a puppy no lynger ; play days are over . When the puppies are put back into the dog wagon , the outfit heads for dinner . By now , the sun is hot and dust devils dance in the wind . For the country around Forget is dry , with almost no rain , and no wheat crop for ten years . They say a young boy walked out of a Forget store one day just as it began to rain . When the first drop of water struck him , he promptly fainted . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sand on the boy and revived him . Another weather hazard is wind , which sometimes blows for days without stopping . They say it once blew a dog against a grain elevator and held him there until he starved , but I doubt if this is literally true . Points on Pointihg In the hot early afternoon , the prairie chickens become lazy and congregate in the shade of the bluffs . This makes an excellent training item for the dog men , for they can put the young dogs on check cords and give them endless bird work around the bluffs . The chickens are reluctant to fly , and when they do flush , they go only fifty yards or so . The trainers follow , and the dogs are allowed to locate the birds and point them again and again . The apparently mysterious tendency of a dog to point game is really not mysterious . Many carnivorous creatures freeze momentarily before springing upon their game . It 's somewhat a matter of getting set . Watch a spider sometime , or a cat . Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fowl , and he trained the dog to exag- gerate the pause . There is a quite re-liable case on record of a pointing pig , which was used for a shooting animal in England . The pig , according to the record , would point quail , woodcock and pheasant ; it would also retrieve , and even honor the point of a bird dog . Mr. Ripley , perhaps , would n't believe this , but a dog man would . Many puppies make their first points on prairie chickens . It 's a heartwarming sight to see a young dog suddenly slow up , then freeze , his muscles taut and his nose twitching . The trainer walks carefully to the side of the , dog , and strokes him , running his hand from the dng 's neck to the tip of his tail , which soothes the animal 's nerves . Some dogs are precocious , and begin pointing game at four or five months . Others go for two or three years before they can be " stopped , " or broken . Like Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Terry is now three years old and still thinks that the fun of hunting is trying to catch birds on the wing  --  he occasionally does it , what 's more ? instead of pointing them . He 's a fine , big-running dog , though , for all his hardheadedness , and when Farrior can bring him to his senses he will make a field-trial dog . Another dog that needs special treatment is Jack , a derby pointer . Somebody was careless with Jack when he was a puppy , and now he is gun-shy . Ordinarily , a gun-shy dog might as well be given up as a bud job , but Jack , like Terry , is worth the trouble . He runs wide and merrily , points with cold accuracy . When the gun comes out of the saddle scabbard , though , Jack is through for the day . The standard treatment for gun-shyness is the starvation method . The dog is offered his food pan to the accompaniment of blank-pistol fire . He of course forgets his hunger and dives hack into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally the dog 's hunger overcomes his fear of the gun , and he eats with the shooting ringing in his ears . Jack went eight days without eating , and you could count his ribs . On the ninth he ate . Now the gun is shot over him at every meal , and though he still does n't exactly reach heights of ecstasy when he sees Farrior coming with the gun , he manifests his disapproval only by a couple of barks of protest . Before you condemn the treatment as cruel , remember that itlasts for only a few days , and a gun-shy dog is worthless as a hunter and will either end up with a humane bullet in his head or as a fat and lifeless pet in some spinster 's apartment . But if you cure him , he again gaily ranges the countryside for bird scent , doing what God made him to do  --  hunt . Jack is the dog that pointed the prairie chicken in the tree . After a short cast , we found Jack on point behind a dead poplar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him a prairie chicken sat , plainly silhouetted  --  a remarkable sight . The chicken seemed more curious than alarmed , and allowed me to work fairly close with my camera before she flew . Much of the special treatment that the dogs get is medicinal . On the lone prairee , there 's no veterinarian to be phoned ; the trainer is his own doctor . Sore feet  --  prevalent during the early part of the season before the dog 's pads are hardened  --  are treated by antiseptic , by flexible collodion which forms an artificial skin over the wound , and by confinement of the dog . Occasionally there are fight wounds . At the beginning of a training season the dogs are carefully watched , and any two dogs that seem always to have conflicting opinions are separated . However , the number of pens is limited , and separation can go on just so far . One noon we came in to find two pointers silently locked in what would have been death combat . When they were , with difficulty , pulled apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threshing machine . Curiously enough , these pointers belonged to the same owner , and had been raised together . After the fight they behaved better , but for the rest of the summer they muttered harsh things at each other . Forty Supper Thieves Another hazard of the prairies is spear grass ; the seed pod of this weed is a tiny barb which often gets in a dog 's mouth and works into the flesh , making a had wound . Every time a dog is taken up , his mouth is carefully wiped out with a cloth . But for the most part the treatment of the dogs is preventive  --  among other things , thorough drying of a dog that has run in dew-wet cover , periodic worming of the entire kennel , and an occasional sprinkling of cod-liver oil on the daily meal of cracklings and shredded wheat . Because of the tendency of a dog to prefer his kennel mate 's supper to his own , the feeding of forty dogs at one time without general warfare would seem eamn a mp rboebr eomf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ osungahp , hooks , spaced around the pens ; before feeding every evening , each dog is fastened so that he can reach neither the food pan nor the throat of his friend near by . A dog that gets fat easily has to be worked overtime , but mot of them burn excess weight off without any trouble . Sometimes , to keep a dog in condition without risking staleness by too much bird work , the harness is brought out , and for an hour the dog is " roaded " ? allowed to pull against a check leash . That way he goes to the trials eager to hunt , as well as lean and tough . Field-Trial Veterans And he has to he tough to keep , vhipping out the miles campaigning from August to March . The major field-trial circuit begins at Moose Jaw , Canada , on prairie chicken ; it ends in late February with the national chameionship , on quail , at Grand Junction , Tennessee . Of the scores of trials in between , a big-time dog will make from five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occasionally in between , the dog will be under the surveillance of Dr. Benton King , the best-known field-trial judge in the sport , and perhaps , by his eternal insistence on fast and stylish bird-dog performance , more than any other living man responsible for the top quality of the modern bird dog . " When you 're running a dog under him , " the handlers say , " you better have a dog that will hump . " Doctor King is a small and amiably crusty Tennessean , who quirts his horse in wild , thundering flights across the buffalo wallows and badger holes of the prairies , or the ditches and stumps of the Southern piney woods , but in an automobile regards as blinding speed anything above forty miles an hour . Riding up front with the judges at the important trials will be a man who looks like a movie sportsman , George Rogers , reporter for The American Field . The Field calls itself an all-round sporting magazine , but in reality it is a field-trial newspaper , and the dog men read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers is there to see every point at every big trial . Probably present also will be the veteran Jake Bishop , with his spectacles halfway down his nose , a first-class dog man who this year trained in Canada for the thirty-eighth summer ; and big Ches Harris , who has won more national championships than any other living handler , and the Crangles , father and son , and a loquacious , hard-riding little Texan , V. E. Humphreys ; and the fashion-plate handlers , Clyde Morton and Dewey English . Some of the owners will he there , too ; possibly Gerald Livingston , and Carl Duffield , the wealthy setter man who trains his own dogs and wins with them , and M. G. Dudley , and Udo Fleischmnnn , and W. C. Teagle , and E. J. Shaffer , and Miss Claudia Phelps . Practically everybody attending the trial will have a different idea about which dog won . Who really won is not a matter of fact but a matter of opinion . Unless some dog got hot and kept everybody standing excitedly in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement is usually greeted with several looks of puzzlement and disappointment , and that night in the hotel there 'll be many confidential handed down to her by her mother or father , she did not say so to Mrs. Nelson 's mother . When Elizabeth Nelson was less than a year old , her family moved to Allenhurst , New Jersey . Miss Fries and Mrs. Trushel were living there , and the former announced her intention of setting up a trust fund for her godchild . She would deposit two dollars the first year , doubling the sum I each year for a period of years , all of it to accumulate at interest in a savings bank . And on April 25 , 1911 , she did deposit two dollars in the Seacoast National Bank , of Asbury Park , for Elizabeth C. Nelson , naming herself and her sister as trustees . That money amounted to $2.83 by 1929 ; both trustees having died without having made any provision for the trust . In 1931 the bank was liquidated . Mrs. Nelson still has the passbook with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fading paper on which her benefactress had written : " May she live to be a good woman . " When Elizabeth Nelson was three , her family moved to Montclair , New Jersey , and five years later to the Northern Neck of Virginia , from where they did not return to New Jersey until Elizabeth was sixteen . Investigation has developed that Miss Fries had died on September 11 , 1912 , without the knowledge of Mrs. Nelson 's mother . For she had written Miss Fries several times from Virginia , the letters returned only as " unclaimed . " Once back in New Jersey , Elizabeth journeyed to Allenhurat and learned only that Miss Fries and Mrs. Trushell had been gone for years from their former home . It was long after that when she learned that both were dead . While Elizabeth Nelson was growing up , her mother kept the two photographs concealed in the bottom of a trunk . They were not forgotten there : Miss Fries ' mysterious gifts were much the most exciting thing that had happened in Elizabeth 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . When the photographs did come into her possession on her twenty-first birthday in 1931 , she did not know what to do with them . She needed expert advice , and she knew of no Lincolniana collector or how to go about finding one . When she did , in 1935 , find such a collector whom she could trust , he believed the Lincoln photograph to be authentic and referred her to other experts . All were discouraging . Some said that no photograph ever had been made of Lincoln after death . Another said that the amhrotype had passed out of use before Lincoln 's death . This , on the testimony of the Eastman Company , is as mistaken as the previous statement . A great Lincoln authority , Mr. F. H. Meserve , of New York , owner of many of the Brady negatives , compared the photograph minutely with the well-known one for which Lincoln sat four days before Booth murdered him . Mr. Meserve objected that Mrs. Nelson 's photograph did not show the mole , that the arch of the eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Nelson feels that all these points may readily be explained by the distortion following the autopsy , in which the skull was opened ; by the embalming process and the wax mixed with yellow paint applied to the face ; by the nine days that had elapsed since death , and the ordeal of travel and public display . Another circumstance which may argue for the authenticity of the photograph is that there is no known instance of a picture being made of the dead , except on the battlefield by Brady and other Civil War photographers , until well after 1865 . " Who but a martyred President would have been pictured in death thus early in the history of photography , more than a generation before the first news photographs ? " it is argued . That this photograph dates at least as far back as the 60 's has not been questioned . Mrs. Nelson is employed by the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company , and she has neither the time nor the means required for the research necessary for authenticating the photograph further . Few corpses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He died on the morning of April 15 , 1865 . Congress proposed that he be buried in a vault in the Capitol which had been intended for Washington . The state of Virginia and the Washington family having insisted upon burial at Mt . Vernon , the vault had remained empty . The story is that Mrs. Lincoln vetoed burial in the Capitol . The truth is that the Illinois delegation demanded the return of the body to Springfield , and that Mrs. Lincoln objected to this . If her husband was to return to Illinois , she suggested that it be to Chicago . She did not like Springfield . She said that it was remote and obscure . Though she did not any so , it was in her mind that a memorial already had been erected in Springfield to Stephen A. Douglas , Lincoln 's great rival and once a suitor of Mary Todd Lincoln . It was not until April twentieth that Mrs. Lincoln was induced to agree to Springfield . The townspeople chose the Mather property , where the state capitol now stands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln did n't like the Mothers and she forbade it , selecting instead the newly opened Oak Ridge Cemetery on the outskirts . Abraham Lincoln 's funeral was held in the White House East Room on April nineteenth , a nd the body was borne to the Capitol rotunda , where it lay in state until the evening of the twentieth . Then , to satisfy a public demand , the body was returned to Springfield by a circuitous route which retraced roughly that by which Lincoln had come to Washington for his inauguration . It was not until May fourth , nineteen days after his death , that the corpse reached the receiving vault of Springfield 's Oak Ridge .
