txt A one month liquor making holiday " in July , during which distillers will be released from the production of industrial alcohol for War purposes , was announced today by Chairman Krug of the war production board . The liquor holiday , second of 1945 , was made possible , Krug said , by a reduction in alcohol requirements of Russia and an increasing use of petroleum instead of industrial alcohol in the manufacture of synthetic rubber in this country . Liquor producers are expected to be able to turn out during the four weeks about 50 million gallons of distilled spirits ? the equivalent of a year 's normal supply of drinking liquor . Alcohol produced will be used for making blended and straight whisky and gin .
