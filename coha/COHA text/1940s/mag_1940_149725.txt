Last week Bertrand Russell ( Earl Russell in England ) found a roost . His U. S. odyssey had taken him to University of California at Los Angeles , where he taught last year , to Harvard , where he lectures this autumn , and to the College of the City of New York , where his appointment raised a storm . When a Tammany judge last spring ruled that his " salacious attitude toward sex " disqualified him to teach at C. C. N. Y. ( TIME , April 8 ) , U. S. men of learning deplored the New World 's inhospitality to one of the world 's original minds . Last week a small , eccentric art school , the Barnes Foundation , in Philadelphia 's suburban Merion , gave him a five-year appointment to lecture on the history of culture . <P> The Barnes Foundation is a one-man show founded and run by Albert Coombs Barnes , who invented Argyrol , made millions from his invention and in 1922 , aged 49 , started his school . Mr. Barnes endowed his Foundation with $6,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cezannes , Renoirs , Picassos , Matisses . A salty and original character , Albert Barnes worked his way through University of Pennsylvania Medical School by playing semi-pro baseball , studied at Heidelberg . Now he teaches appreciation of the fine arts to 150 students , whom he selects with great care , lectures to explosively . Around his Italian Renaissance building and twelve acres stands a ten-foot spite wall , erected when a suburban development sprang up next to his school . <P> Last week Mr. Barnes announced that Bertrand Russell , 64 , would be a " permanent fixture " at his Foundation , that there would be " no restrictions " on the eminent philosopher . Said he : " The sky is the limit . " Earl Russell will buy a farm in Chester County , settle down . Lecturing on culture and ideas for the Foundation 's courses in the traditions of painting , he will have the same salary as C. C. N. Y. offered ( $8,000 ) , a light teaching schedule , time to write . Said Bertrand Russell : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
