Warsaw was in flames . The partisanforces of General Bor which nearly four weeks ago had risen at the approach of the Red armies , fought fires and Germans with equal gallantry . From housetops they dropped Molotov cocktails on Germantanks . Their women operated 100 field kitchens and first-aid posts.Unable to reach Warsaw 's cemeteries , they buried their dead in parks and public squares . Their food and water were running short . <P> Nevertheless they held their strongholds in the central district . They even attacked German positions , destroyed half of a battalion , captured a platoon . From somewhere , it seemed , they had got a mysterious transfusion of new strength . <P> Last week Mediterranean Allied Air Forces headquarters in Italy disclosed that , since early August , 100 four-engined British bombers had been sent out on the 1,750-mile nonstop route to Warsaw and back , to drop weapons and ammunition by parachute to the harried patriots . The pilots had to throttle down low over the city to make reasonably sure that their consignments reached Poles and not Germans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver their loads . <P> General Bor was grateful . He sent a message : " We bow to the crews who have given their lives . " <P> Open Contempt .

The Russians admitted abandoning several places west of Riga . To the east , however , Generals Bagramian and Masslenikov were squeezing the pocket hard . <P> Cocking the Pistols . The world waited , as for a long-delayed stage entrance , for the Red armies to cross the East Prussian border . The Germans defending their own soil threw into battle armored units brought from Italy and " heavy catapult appliances " ( possibly rocket platforms ) . The iron-muscled and iron-willed young Jewish general , Ivan Chernyakhovsky , had 150,000 men-by German count-massed on the province 's eastern border . After an artillery barrage of 3,000 shells in 20 minutes , Chernyakhovsky 's infantry closed in along the Kaunas-Konigsberg railroad .
