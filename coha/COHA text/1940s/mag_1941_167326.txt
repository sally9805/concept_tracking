For three days last weekend , the brand new 35,000-ton German battleship Bismarck was mistress of the seas . Against seemingly heavy odds , she had blown to bits Britain 's largest warship , the 42,100-ton Hood ; fought off one of Britain 's newest and mightiest , the Prince of Wales . The fight lasted only 300 seconds ; took place last Saturday morning in Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland . <P> But 78 hours later the Bismarck went down fighting after the briefest and wildest career of any modern battleship . With all the available sea power of Britain mobilized to intercept her before she could get back to her base , Berlin announced just after midnight Tuesday morning that for four hours the Bismarck had been " again engaged in a heavy fight with superior British naval units . " Early Tuesday morning , the Bismarck radioed that she had been incapacitated , but " we will fight to the last hand grenade . " And the last message before the Bismarck sank at 11 o'clock Tuesday morning said : " Ship out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live the Fuehrer . " <P> It was not Britain 's battleships that sank the Bismarck . It was the fleet air arm . And so , paradoxically , the speedy sinking of the Bismarck gave little cheer to those who wish to believe that Britain 's navy is mistress of the seas . On the contrary , it was reserved for the pride of Hitler 's navy to prove for the first time that even the mightiest unescorted battleship can not long withstand an aerial attack . And in the air , Germany has all the advantage . <P> Aerial reconnaissance warned the British last Thursday that the Bismarck and her escort , the 10,000-ton cruiser Prinz Eugen , had left the Norwegian port of Bergen for a dash for the open sea to raid the Atlantic convoys . Powerful units were at once mobilized to intercept them . At dawn Saturday , she was engaged by the Hood and the Prince of Wales . The Hood was destroyed " with very few survivors " by a lucky hit on her powder magazine at a range of more than 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by a hit on her bow . She was still further slowed by an aerial torpedo which struck her that afternoon . <P> In the fog and darkness Saturday night , the British warships lost contact with the raider but a long-range Catalina scouting plane ( a twin-engine American-built flying boat from the Consolidated plant in San Diego ) spotted her again Sunday noon making for the French ports . Monday afternoon , about 400 miles west of Brest , she was attacked by wave after wave of fleet-based bombers and planes from the Ark Royal . Two torpedoes struck her , one amidships and the other astern . <P> " This second torpedo , " said First Lord of the Admiralty A. V. Alexander , " apparently affected the steering of the ship , for not only was she reduced to very low speed but she continued making uncontrollable circles in the sea , in which condition she was attacked by our flotillas with two more torpedoes which brought her virtually to a standstill , far from help and far outside the range within which enemy bomber aircraft from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
