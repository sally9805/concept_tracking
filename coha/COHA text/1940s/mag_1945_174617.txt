As every Berliner must have known in his heart , the mammoth march of Red Army power could not be stopped . The Russians might be delayed , but their day of victory could not long be denied . <P> But thousands of Berliners , men and boys , ill-clothed , ill-weaponed , inept Volkssturmer , old &; tired onetime soldiers , the fanatic Hitlerjugend , even hundreds of women , went to the fields and forests at the edges of the city . There they found trenches , pillboxes , antitank ditches . They also found begrimed , bone-tired soldiers and Luftwaffe officers scrambled in irregular detachments . And they found enormous numbers of antiaircraft guns with their wicked snouts now leveled , dug-in tanks with their deadly 88s , machine guns aligned , almost tripod to tripod , to sweep the highways . Perhaps- ? <P> Then , from the wall of smoke and swirling dust on the close horizon , broke the first bolts of doom . Russian shells and rockets showered , then rained , then poured . There had never been such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staggering , wildly running German soldiers . After them came the Red Army tanks . <P> Arc of Flame . Then there was the hellish vortex of battle-the high-pitched screeches and sharp bursts of shells , the awful concussions , the crunching torture of the earth itself . The Russian tanks passed on and over . <P> Thus , in a 70-mile arc of flame and steel , had the soldiers of Red Marshal Georgi K. Zhukov , Stalin 's designated conqueror of Berlin , come up to the outskirts of the Nazi capital . They had left behind , on the roads and fields back to Kstrin and Schwedt , thousands of dead German soldiers , more thousands of prisoners , hills of wreckage . In five days they had fought through five defense belts , smashing down a great concentration of enemy tanks in what may have been the war 's biggest battle of armor . Now they could pierce the heart of the Hitlerites ' realm-the scarred , sprawling fourth city of the world , the Nazis ' holy ground . Russian shells screamed over and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gringstrasse and into Potsdamer Platz . There , in the Kriegsministerium , the conquest of Russia had once been mapped by confident Wehrmacht commanders . <P> The Clamp . The millions of Berliners who could not fight , those who did not want to fight now that doom was on the doorstep , milled in panic . They surged to the Ringbahn , fought each other to get on the last trains to anywhere . They massed in the air-raid shelters , choked the Unter-grundbahn platforms and tracks . Stunned , they huddled wherever they could find shelter and waited for the end . <P> Zhukov 's men did not wait . Like a multi-toothed clamp , the Red Army sent piercing thrusts into the outer districts , tightening the pressure all around . Suddenly the Russians were everywhere in the ring of industrial districts and workers ' suburbs to the north and east . The first deep piercings were among the wreckage of the rows of dark , ugly brick and stone houses of Wreissensee and Pankow . Here had lived the hundreds of thousands of Berliners who had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were Berlin 's onetime centers of Socialism and Communism . Now there were SS troopers and Nazi youth fighting from flaming block to block , from the warehouses and factories turned into fortresses .
