A sure cure for ulcers has not been found , but doctors are still looking . In the past 50 years , doctors have recommended at least 46 different kinds of diet , and 108 different drugs , vitamins , sex hormones , etc . The newest suggestion , made last week : cabbage juice . <P> For the past ten years , Dr. Garnett Cheney of Stanford University 's School of Medicine has been studying an anti-ulcer factor he tentatively calls vitamin U ( TIME , Jan. 1 , 1945 ) . Tests on patients have been encouraging ; their ulcers got better when Dr. Cheney fed them on foods containing vitamin U , but he could not prove that U did the trick . <P> Cabbage , Dr. Cheney found , contained a lot of vitamin U , and seemed to keep guinea pigs from getting ulcers . In California Medicine , he reported results of a five-month test on 13 patients . He gave them a quart of cabbage juice a day , squeezed out by a juice presser from fresh raw cabbage . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no regular doses of alkalis , and were allowed to smoke all they wanted . All their food was cooked ; vitamin U is destroyed by cooking , and Cheney wanted his patients to get it only in the carefully measured cabbage juice , served a glass at a time , five times a day . Five of the patients had ulcers in the stomach , seven in the duodenum , one in both the stomach and the jejunum ( part of the small intestine just below the duodenum ) . They all got better quickly , according to X-ray evidence . Average healing time was 10.4 days for the duodenal ulcers ( compared with 37 days for a control group treated by milk , alkalis and the conventional bland diet ) , 7.3 days for the six stomach ulcers ( compared with 42 days ) . <P> Vitamin U is also found in celery , unpasteurized milk , fresh greens , raw egg yolks , cereal grasses , certain animal and vegetable fats . Dr. Cheney says cautiously that his experiment is not final proof that vitamin U heals ulcers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
