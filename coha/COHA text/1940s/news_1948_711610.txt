txt An " iron rush " is on at the western end of Lake Superior . This excited activity of the mining industry is remarkable to behold  --  it is occurring in an area that 's already supplying 8570 of the nation 's steel-making requirements , and at a time when everyone knows the highgrade deposits of the great Lake Superior range are rapidly running out . The rush now is to exploit the " almost unlimited " quantities of low-grade ore . That 's why research men are crowding in  --  to find a good-cheap way to turn poor ore into suitable material for the steel mills Most major iron mining firms have been building new research laboratories up here . Before the war there were two ; now there are seven and an eighth is under construction . Two big new experimental plants for processing lean ore have been built . Plenty of Prospectors The prospectors are busy , as well . The man who keeps tabs on that is Ray D. Nolan , director of the Division of Lands and Minerals of Minnesota 's Conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period ended in June , 1947 , only 10 prospecting permits were issued by the state . Since then 100 have been granted and another hundred applications are on file awaiting action . To " prove up " a property they think may have ore worth digging , the mining firms bore down with diamond drills , getting a core of the rock So diamond drilling is a barometer of future mine development And the diamond drilling firms are doing more work on the Lake Superior deposits than in many a year . S. E. Atkins of Duluth , one of the biggest operators , says he has 18 outfits going now . In 1941 he had only six working . Another big diamond drilling enterprise , E. J. Longyear Co. , reports a " great quickening of drilling activity during 194.8 . " Mining men interviewed on the range without exception say that in 1948 there has been more diamond drilling to locate iron and more leasing of ore properties than at any time since the early days when mining was just getting started here This burst of interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects the fact that rich , easy-to-mine reserves are running low . War operations of the steel mills took a big bite and their appetite remains hearty in peace . Do n't Dare Wait The rich ore wo n't be gone tomorrow . Geologists estimate high-grade reserves at anything between 1.1 billion and 2.2 billion tons , enough for 13 to 27 years ' requirements at the current rate of shipments . One difficulty is that the rich reserves are n't evenly divided . U. S. Steel Corp .. biggest steel producer , has by all odds the biggest reserves . and insists it needs them- Some smaller firms ' reserves are already low and others do n't dare wait until the last minute to switch to low-grade ore . The thousands of fabricating firms supplied by these steel-makers have a stake in the gamble on the poorer ores . The steel cities such as Pittsburgh , Gary , Cleveland and Youngstown largely " live " on Lake Supeflor ore . Less directly , all the nation will be affected by the outcome of the new ' iron rush . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convert the low-grade ore into a usable feed for blast furnaces  --  they already know how to do that . Their job is to discover less costly ways of processing such lean ore . The industry here at the head of the lakes also faces the problem of raising enormous quantities of capital . H. C. Jackson . a partner in the big iron firm of Pickands , Mather &; Co. , believes it will take 15 to 20 years to build the huge facilities needed to process the low-grade ore . During this period , but particularly over the next 10 years . Mr. Jackson says . " there will be extraordinary demand for risk capital to finance experimental work and the erection of experimental plants of commercial size . " U. S. Steel recently threw some light on the capital that will be required to build plants for processing the low-grade ore , which is known here as " taconite . " In its employe magazine the company said : " It is estimated that it will take a total investment of over half a billion dollars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a ratio in excess of $10 in original plant investment to every ton produced annually . " Some Results of Research While the new laboratories are indicative of the accelerating research , they have n't been at work long enough to produce revolutionary results . But other research that has been in progress over a longer period is turning up significant developments . One of these promises to slash the cost of getting the taconite out of the ground . Much of the rich ore the industry has been producing is so soft it can be readily scooped up by giant power shovels . But taconite is granite-hard . To get it out , holes 30 feet or so deep and six to nine inches in diameter must be cut . The holes are then " loaded ' ? with explosives so the rock can be blasted . Up to now " churn drills " have been used for cutting the " blast holes . " Under this system a string of tools weighing up to 2,500 pounds is repeatedly dropped on the rock , gradually chipping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two feet an hour . Now , however , it is reported the same job can be done eight to ten times faster by an entirely new type of rig . Union Carbide 5 . Carbon Corp . reports it has sold the first commercial model . It will be put into service near Hibbing next month . A second will be delivered in December . Instead of cutting , this new device " melts " holes in the rock . Union Carbide calls the process " jet piercing . " A jet of oxygen and another of kerosene are directed against the rock in a flame . raising , temperature of the ore about 3.500 degrees Fahrenheit Simultaneously , the rig shoots a stream of ' water at the red-hot rock . This shatters off rock particles like so many flint arrowheads . L. H. Rasmussen. division sales manager for Union Carbide. says jet piercing costs only 75 , .. % as much as the cheapest method used up to now . This estimate takes into consideration the much higher original cost of the jet piercing rigs  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of around 522.000 for a churn drill . Like Powdered Sugar The taconite does n't contain enough iron to be usable as is in a blast furnace  --  only about 30r : , of this ore is iron compared with 50% or 60'i , iron content of high grade ore . And taconite contains far too much silica-50. ; ; - or so . Rich grades of Lake Superior ore have less than 10% silica . So mining companies face a problem of beneflciating or concentrating the ore , to raise the iron content to over 50t1 and get rid of much of the silica . First the taconite must be crushed to powdered sugar consistency . Crushing costs have been halved as the result of research at the Minnesota Mines Experiment Station in Minneapolis . Taconite is crushed down from chunks of boulder size , but three-quarters of the power required to do this crushing job goes into reducing it from pebbles to powder , researchers at the station discovered . So they added a step to the process to separate and discard the leanest material when the taconite reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ways to separate the iron from the silica and other impurities . Some of the taconite is magnetic . This variety can be concentrated by drawing the iron out with powerful magnets . The non-magnetic taconite is more of a problem . One of the most promising methods of concentrating this type of ore is by " flotation . " The firm that perhaps leads the field in working our flotation processes . Mineral Separation North American Corp. , set up a pilot plant three years ago at Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co. ' s Canisteo Mine . near Coleraine , Minn . E H. Brown , who is in charge of the operation . pulled a daily report on ' a nail in his unpainted office at the plant to illustrate the job being done . The report showed that the unit converted the fine material with 26 7c ; - iron and silica into a finished product with 58.7,1- iron and 9 S , ; ; - silica . Starch . Lime and Soap Here 's how Ir Brown does the job : The low-grade ore is fed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore ) . This drops the iron particles to the bottom . Then the mixture passes on to a lime bath ( three pounds of lime to the ton of ore ) which puts a coating on the particles of silica . Finally , it moves on to a soap solution ( one-half pound of soap to the ton ) . The soap pushes the coated grains of silica to the surface so it can be scooped off the top and the iron taken from the bottom . It requires about 50 cents worth of starch . lime and soap and an additional 50 cents worth of power to treat a ton of ore , Mr. Brown says . But the problem does n't end here . Ore that 's powdery fine wo n't work in a blast furnace  --  it blows right out the top . These " fines " can be mixed with coal and heated to form a clinker-like material called " sinter " that works well But it costa around $1.25 a ton here on the range to convert the powder Mtn staters . At the Mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trims cost to about 80 cents a ton , according to Dr. E. W. Davis , director . The powder is moistened , and fed into a revolving drum that rolls it snowball fashion into round pellets of iron . These pellets are then " cooked " in ovens until they become hard enough to hold together in a blast furnace . Power will be one of the big costs in manufacturing taconite into high-grade ore . There 's a state-financed research project under way that mining men hope will pave the way for cheaper power . Minnesota . in addition to being rich in iron ore , has huge reserves of peat  --  they total 6.8 billion tons . A state agency , the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Committee , has put over $25,000 into a project designed to find ways of converting this peat into cheap fuel . The state researchers hope to cut peat mining costs by washing it out of the ground with a powerful hose . They are experimenting with a. pelleting process , similar to the one used with iron ore . to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fuel that will burn in regular furnaces . Rising Laboratories Within a few years , the new laboratories here on the range should begin showing results that will go a long way toward bringing down the costs of making high-grade ore from taconite . Pickands , Mather &; Co. put up the first of these new laboratories . Located in Hibbing , it was finished in 1941 . Since the end of the war , new laboratories have been completed by Oliver Iron Mining Co a I.% S. Steel subsidiary ; M. A. Hanna Co. : Jones &; Laughlin Steel Co. and the state of Minnesota ( it will do research for small ora firms ) . Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co. has a $350,000 laboratory under construction at Ishpeming that will be finished next summer . In the meantime , the company is doing research in temporary headquarters nearby . Butler Brothers has had a laboartory at Cooley , Minn. , for sonic years ; it has been doubled in size since the war . In addition to these research laboratories . Pickands , Mather has about completed a S2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce 200.000 tons of concentrate a year from taconite Mining men who have inspected it say the process that will be tried involves crushing the taconite , separating the iron out magnetically and pelleting the fine material . Oliver also has a large experimental unit . It went into operation about three years ago and in 1948 will , treat about 350.000 tons of marginal ore , to find economical ways of utilizing it .
