&gt; Early in the week San Francisco 's shortwave station KGEI had Mrs. Jonathan Wainwright broadcast a message of good cheer to " Skinny , " accompanied by three wagging woofs from the General 's pet Labrador Retriever . When the end of Bataan came , KGEI 's " Freedom for the Philippines " rose to the occasion with a solemnity by which the grim survivors on Corregidor were moved to tears : " The world will long remember the epic struggle the Filipinos and Americans put up . . . . But what sustained them through all these months of incessant battle was a force more than physical . It was the thought of their native land and all it holds that is most dear to them . ... " <P> &gt; Endangered was the Philippines ' own " Voice of Freedom , " which has been broadcasting from Corregidor to the Islands on a patched-up , medium-wave sender ever since Manila fell ( TIME , March 16 ) .

Walking through remote interior sections of the jungle at noontime we suddenly hear The Star-Spangled Banner , then Freedom announces , ' Hello , everyone , everywhere . . . . ' Filipinos from occupied cities and areas told us how the people cluster around muffled radios for the Freedom broadcasts , then pass the word along , via grapevine . The broadcasts have been successful because they are written assuming that the Filipinos are all loyal , which is true . ... "
