I WOULD N'T DREAM OF IT A STORY BY LEANE ZUGSMITH MHE Charles Street police station was I only a couple of blocks away , so it did n't take the detectives more than five minutes to get over . When they rang the bell Adelaide just stood and looked at Mrs. Carlisle . She was naturally a pale colored girl , but now her skin looked like bleached-out khaki and the freckles under her eyes stood out like drops of tar . The bell rang a second time , peremptorily . " I 'll go , " Mrs. Carlisle said nervously . " And for goodness ' sake , Adelaide , put some powder on or something and do n't keep looking like something the cat dragged in . " This time she did n't even notice that Mrs. Carlisle was different ; she even treated you enough like a white girl to know you used powder too . She could n't keep back the tears again . " You do n't know how they 'll talk to me , " she said and she put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked enormous , not tall so much as bursting out of their clothes , their shoulders , their arms , their hands big enough and strong enough . . . she winced and made herself think : for their jobs . Even the sunburnt one , who could n't be more than thirty , or anyway more than a few years older than she was , eyed her in a way that chilled her . " Perhaps I 'd better tell it first and then Adelaide cam " said Mrs. Carlisle . She made the detectives sit down andhanded them cigarettes . " Because Adelaide ? " The older one interrupted her . " What 's her last name ? " " Morrisey , " said Mrs. Carlisle . " Look , officers , Adelaide has worked for me , part-time , for nearly four years . I trust her utterly . " She looked up at Adelaide standing near her and smiled . " What happened , as I said over the ' phone , was somebody rang the bell around three and Adelaide pressed the button and he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he said Mr. Carlisle wanted his brown suit cleaned . " " A nigger or white ? " asked the older one . " He was a Negro , Adelaide said . " Mrs. Carlisle 's fair face became flushed as though she were angry or embarrassed , Adelaide could n't tell which . Anyway , it was all she could do to pretend she did n't know the young one 's cold blue stare was fixed upon her . " And she never saw him before in her life , " the older one said , then he snickered . " I never did , " said Adelaide without moving . " He said , just like Mrs. Carlisle told you , he said Mr. Carlisle stopped by on his way to the office this morning and said to come get a brown suit between two and three when I 'd be here , like I am every other day , I mean , Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays . That 's the God 's own truth . " Her voice cracked on the last words and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adelaide should have asked what cleaner he came from , " Mrs. Carlisle said quickly . " If I 'd been home  --  but that 's carelessness , not dishonesty . " " I would of , " Adelaide said , crying harder , " Only I just took it for granted . I thought it was orders . " " Anyway , " said Mrs. Carlisle , grinding out her cigarette in the ashtray , " my husband did n't stop by any cleaners and did n't plan to have his suit cleaned and it cost him eighty-five dollars less than four months ago . " She suddenly looked winningly at the men . " Is there any chance of tracing it , officers ? We really ca n't afford to lose it . " " Well , I think maybe we can . " The older one got up ponderously and moved toward Adelaide . " With a little co-operation . " He showed almost all his teeth . Then he said roughly : " All right . Do you want to give us his name now or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it later ? " Inside her it felt as if an icy oil was coming right up into her throat . She wet her lips . " I do n't know his name , I never saw him before , " she said faintly . It was n't going to be any use , she thought , it was n't going to make the least little bit of difference that she had n't had a thing to do with it . The younger one was on his feet now looking at her  --  but that was n't news ; he had n't ever stopped since he walked in . " Come on now , Adelaide , " he said and his voice was soft and syruplike ; it sounded worse to her than the other one 's . " Tell us about that boy friend of yours . Let her sit down a second ? " he looked at his companion ? " and tell us about that fellow she thinks the world of . " " What 's the nigger 's name ? " the older one said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her finger . " I 'd rather you did n't talk to Adelaide that way if you do n't mind , " she said in an apologetic voice . " My husband . . . and I feel , that is ? " She stopped and looked helplessly at the etching of the waterfowl over the sofa . " I mean , Adelaide 's been with us , part-time , for nearly four years . " Mechanically she added : " I have utter trust in her . " " Well , either you want us to get him or you do n't , " the older one said indifferently . " We can just take her along right now ; it 's all the same to us . " He put a big meaty hand on Adelaide 's arm and she checked her impulse to pull away . " My goodness , we want the suit back , " Mrs. Carlisle said uncertainly . " Okay . " The older one used Adelaide 's arm as a lever , so rapidly that she found herself before him without remembering moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she started to move she spoke . " I did n't have a thing to do with it , " she said in a dull , solemn voice . " It was the first I ever laid eyes on him . " " Get moving , " said the older one . " Of course you did n't know him , " said the younger one but there was n't any compassion in his cold eyes . " But what about your boy friend , maybe he knows him ? Why do n't you try to think back , Adelaide , you know to the night you told him about that fine brown suit the mister had ? " She lifted her head . " I never knew which was the brown suit before to-day , " she said drearily . " I do n't clean the closets but once a month and I do n't take time to look at all that 's in them . " The older one jabbed his thumb beneath her shoulder blade . " All right . Save it for later , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Carlisle clenched her small hands into fists . " I just ca n't let you  --  my husband would never forgive me . " " It 's up to you , lady . " The older one closed his eyes as if he were bored , inclined his head to one side , and nipped his ear lobe between his thumb and finger . " Do n't you have a boy friend , Ade-laide ? " the younger one said in his soft voice . She looked from him to Mrs. Carlisle , twisting her ring . If she said yes they 'd make her give Jules ' name . Then they 'd go to see Jules ' boss and , even though he had n't had a thing to do with it either , they 'd try to pin it on him or he 'd lose his job anyway . " No , I have n't , " she said , looking straight at the detective . " All right , " he said lightly . " Let 's get going , " said his companion . Mrs. Carlisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you  --  I 'd much rather ? " She looked unhappy . " I mean , you could n't take her if I do n't prefer charges or something , can you ? " The older one arched his eyebrows and half yawned . " If you want to drop the whole thing , " he said elaborately , " it 's your privilege . " " My goodness ! " She looked from Adelaide to the two men and back again . " You see , my husband would be simply frantic to have a human being we know ... when there is n't any positive basis to go on , " she said , her voice dwindling away at the end . " Okay . " The older one clapped his hat on his head . At the door he said over his shoulder , " Next time you call , you might find out what you do want first " He looked at her with his lips puckered as though he were about to whistle . The young one gave Adelaide a long look before he disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife out of her . Mrs. Carlisle lighted another cigarette and , without looking at Adelaide , said in too bright a voice : " Well , we 're just where we started , are n't we ? " Adelaide shifted from one foot to another before she said " Mrs. Carlisle , I do n't know how to thank you for sticking up for me , except somehow I 'm going to find him . 1 think I 'd know his face anywhere , even if it was ten years from now . " " I doubt if Mr : Carlisle 's suit would be the right size for him by then . " Mrs. Carlisle straightened the pottery on the mantelpiece and , with her back to Adelaide , said : " Why do n't you just finish up ? You 've been held way over your time . " " Oh , that does n't make a speck of difference , " Adelaide said fervently . She felt her legs wobbling as she went toward the bedroom which she had just started on when Mrs. Carlisle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the suit . Adelaide kept shaking her head sidewise as she thought of it and she turned the mattress without remembering she had turned it earlier . But Mrs. Carlisle remembered . She had followed Adelaide into the room and seemed to be fooling round in one of the dressing-table drawers for a long time . " Are you turning it again , Adelaide ? " she said . Adelaide stared at her for a moment and then at the bed . " I guess I better put my mind down on my work , " she said . " I just could n't help think about it . " Mrs. Carlisle left the room but she was back before Adelaide had started dusting . Usually she kept out of Adelaide 's way but now she seemed to have a million things to do . And when Adelaide went to the living room to empty the ashtrays they had all been using , Mrs. Carlisle was never more than a few steps away . She did n't say anything , she did n't have to , Adelaide thought bitterly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for nearly four years with everybody out . Only now it was dif-ferent , When she was ready to leave Mrs. Carlisle stopped her before she reached the door . " Oh , Adelaide , I hope you do n't mind , " she said in an artificial voice . " I mean , heaving your key . I forgot I was expecting a friend overnight and I have n't an extra one for her . " " Yes , ma'am , " . said Adelaide . She fished in the cracked patent-leather handbag that Mrs. Carlisle had given her when she had finished with it . As she handed over the key she said : " I lied once this afternoon . I said I did n't have a boy friend because I thought if I did they 'd make it bad for him , no matter what . That was the one time I lied . " Mrs. Carlisle flushed . " Oh , Adelaide , please let 's not . I never connected you with anything like that . I would n't dream of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said hurriedly : " It 's just that this sort of thing happening makes me so nervous . Maybe we could switch hours some way so you could come in while I 'm home and then you would n't even need a key , would you ? " She looked up at Adelaide with the same appealing face she had shown the detectives and , for a moment , Adelaide wondered what she would have done if only the soft-spoken one had appeared . Then she said carefully : " You 're afraid to have me any more , I guess . " " That 's such a wrong way to put it , " Mrs. Carlisle said . She backed away a little as she spoke . " It 's just that this is a terribly upsetting experience for me . After all  --  look , Adelaide , you mustadmit I refused to prefer charges against you . " " Yes , ma'am , " Adelaide said and she thought of Mr. Carlisle who had taught his wife never to say " nigger " and who read all the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only you do n't want me back any more , I guess , do you , Mrs. Carlisle ? " " I just do n't know , " she answered in a distressed voice . " I just ca n't think right now . " I know , Adelaide thought as she quietly closed the door and walked down the apartment hall . She could even hear Mrs. Carlisle telling her husband later : " It is n't that I suspect her ; I would n't dream of it . Darling , I snatched her away from those dreadful men . But it would make me so uncomfortable to have her around , I do n't think I could stand it . " And Mr. Carlisle would finally say something about mailing her maybe a day 's pay . She would n't send it back either , she thought , as she trudged toward the subway . She only hoped they 'd think to send her work shoes too . She was going to need them if she could find another place .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
