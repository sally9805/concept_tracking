Recovering from malaria in a California Marine camp , 22-year-old Marine Pfc . Robert E. Borchers of Chicago one night wrote a letter to the American Legion : <P> " I am one of the fortunate Marines who have recently returned to this country after serving in the offensive against the Japanese on Guadalcanal . . . . We find . . . a condition behind our backs that stuns us . We find that our American citizens , those of Japanese ancestry , are being persecuted , yes , persecuted as though Adolf Hitler himself were in charge . <P> " We find that the California American Legion is promoting a racial purge . I 'm putting it mildly when I say it makes our blood boil . . . . We shall fight this injustice , intolerance and un-Americanism at home ! We will not break faith with those who died . . . . We have fought the Japanese and are recuperating to fight again . We can endure the hell of battle , but we are resolved not to be sold out at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter landed plop in the midst of the West 's most violent racial hysteria since " Yellow Peril " pioneer days . The 112,000 U.S. Japanese evacuated from the West Coast had become the object of hatred more intense than the anti-German-American feeling of World War I. The U.S. mortally hates and fears the Jap ; but the furiously boiling stew had many other ingredients . Professional patriots , demagogues and sensational newspapers , led by the Hearst press , were vigorously stirring the witches ' broth . <P> The mayor of Kent , Wash. , truck-gardening town near Seattle , which had some 1,600 Japs before the war , had signs printed up : " We Do n't Want the Japs Back Here Ever . " The mother lodge ( 15,000 members ) of the Fraternal Order of Eagles voted unanimously in Seattle to deport all U.S. Japanese after the war . So did the Portland Progressive Business Men 's Club , and the Oregon State Legion . Hardly anyone ever bothered to distinguish between the alien Japanese , who are deportable , and U.S. citizens of Japanese ancestry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front line in Italy ; another 2,500 Japanese-Americans are elsewhere in the U.S. Army ; hundreds serve in Military Intelligence in the South Pacific ; 20,000 , cleared by FBI , now live in the Midwest &; East . But hate-mongers were not troubled by such facts . <P> Fair Play . The feeling is bitterest in California . A month ago 4,000 Japs , segregated at Tule Lake for disloyalty , rioted ; the affair was clumsily handled by the fumbling War Relocation Authority . Pro-U.S . Japs suffered from the Tule trouble . Almost their only defender has been the Pacific Coast Committee on American Principles and Fair Play . Among its board members : the University of California 's President Robert Gordon Sproul ; Stanford 's former President Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur ; the University of Oregon 's President Donald Erb ; Nobel Prizewinner Dr. Robert A. Millikan . But when the Fair Play Committee 's Pasadena chapter distributed Private Borchers ' letter to the Legion , it promptly got itself " investigated " last week .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
