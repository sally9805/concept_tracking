**27;8576;TOOLONG baby , as the newspapers still call her , though the value of the fortune has been cut in half by the depression . But things are coming back , and dividends are being paid again . That ought to please the well-to-do , but it appears that taxes take most of it  --  the ladies and gentlemen all worry about them , finding fault with the President and calling him bad names . Mr. Lanny grins , teases them , and sometimes gets into an argument . Evidently that is a part of being a Socialist ; you are glad to see the rich taxed , even though you are one of them . A hard thing to imagine ! Mrs. Barnes holds her little granddaughter as the most precious treasure and guards her like an old dragon ; has her sleeping in her room , and does n't mind being waked up by her ; watches her food , sends for the doctor if she sneezes once , and does n't like to see her taken off the estate . She is jealous of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child the greater part of the time . But Mrs. Barnes does not let Mr. Lanny see this ; she humbles her pride , trying her best to please him and make him feel that Shore Acres is his real home . She is all the time taking her brother off and scolding him because he talks too much and bores Mr. Lanny with his opinions , especiallyabout politics and the stock market and that sort of thing . " Shut your fool mouth ! " she says , loud enough for her maid to hear , and of course the story is all over the servants ' quarters before the day is done . Poor Mr. Horace Vandringham , nobody feels very sorry , for he is a big domineering fellow who makes a lot of noise and trouble for the help , giving orders when he has no right to ; he can not bring himself to realize that he is a down-and-outer , a charity boarder , and the pride of his sister will not permit her to put him definitely among the pensioners .

And yet they are n't always happy , you can see it if you watch them closely . There are stories going the rounds of impatient words and irritated looks . They go out a great deal , and servants do n't always find out what happens , but they can guess , because the friendsp201come " to Shore Acres and one gets to know them and sees how they behave . They play cards a lot , and some of them lose money which they ca n't afford . You can tell that by their looks , and sometimes you hear husbands and wives fussing as they go out to their cars  --  oh , yes , there is n't much kept hidden from servants .

Mr. Lanny drinks very little , and he does n't like to see Miss Irma take more than a couple of cocktails . The servants know that and do n't take the trays to her , at least not while her husband is near . That is one of the things they have fusses about now and then ; not long ago he had to help her up to bed , and next morning they had a real row . Her eyes were red with weeping , and she must have promised , because now she drinks much less ; she tries hard to keep him with her , and not have him go off to the city and meet the queer sort of people he likes . Once he took her to some radical meeting , and they had an argument in their room . Her maid heard snatches of it and told it in the upper servants ' dining-room : he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is " he " and " she , " and they will go on for an hour without mentioning a name . There can be only one he and one she in a feudal community . Across Long Island Sound lies the small city of Newcastle , known as the home of Budd Gunmakers and soon to be better known as the home of Budd-Erling Aircraft . Budd 's still made machine guns and automatic carbines and pistols , but most of it was now a hardware plant , which meant that it had lost its social status in the eyes of the old-timers . Lawford Budd , Robbie 's eldest brother , was still vicepresidentin charge of production , but the president now was a Wall Street man , and the board of directors consisted for the most part of dummies representing a syndicate of financial men . Robbie looked upon it with contempt , and his two sons had withdrawn , and so had several of the executives and plant managers . All had come into the new institution , which was going to be a one-purpose plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the latest wrinkles of the scientific management people . As little as a generation ago , if a man had announced that he was going to build a great factory to produce airplanes that would fly faster than two hundred miles an hour , everybody would have known that he was crazy . Indeed , it had been possible for the Wright brothers to stay up in the air over the sand-dunes of North Carolina in their flimsy wood-and-canvas " crate " for many minutes at a time over a period of several months without having the press of the countrypay the slightest attention to them . What they were doing was impossible and therefore the stories could n't be true . But now it had been possible for Robbie Budd to sell five million dollars ' worth of stock , and to have some of the best engineers in the country design and erect a building where planes and nothing else were to be turned out on an assembly line , and he was n't called crazy , but , on the contrary , one of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said they had always known that he had it in him ; he walked with new dignity , gave orders with quiet assurance , and saw that they were carried out promptly . Lanny and his wife motored to Newcastle , by way of the ferry to New London , and paid a visit at the Robbie Budd home . Esther , Lanny 's stepmother , welcomed them cordially . His early sins had been forgiven and perhaps forgotten ; he , too , was a success , quite apart from his rich wife  --  so his relatives and old-time friends tried to make him understand . His profession of art expert was impressive , his musical talents were considerable , he was a linguist and a traveler , almost an ex-diplomat and certainly a friend of the great . The members of the country-club set hastened to honor both husband and wife . If he voiced pinkish opinions  --  well , it was in the Budd traditionto be eccentric and tell the world to go to the devil , and this appeared to be the newest way . The sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here Johannes Robin was in charge . He had got a home for his family half-way between the city and the plant , so that he could commutep203to either . It was Irma 's duty to go with Lanny for a call , and they chose a Sunday afternoon . Papa and Mama , Rahel and the little one were all together again ; they had bought a comfortable old-fashioned New England house of two stories and a dozen rooms , and said they expected to spend the rest of their lives here . Irma thought it was the right way for people of their sort to live  --  far more sensible than an elaborate marble palace and a yacht . She received graciously their thanks for her kindness in the past , and no great lady could have been less condescending to those who had been reduced in social status . Johannes 's hair had turned gray and there wete more lines in his face , but he was the same urbane and subtle person with the flavor of old-worldliness about him . Robbie escorted the couple to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of piling had been driven into the marshes , and great dredges had lifted the mud out of one side and dropped it into the other , so as to make steamship berths and docks . The cow pastures had been covered with concrete , and a skeleton of steel had risen over them , and now it had walls of glass and a roof of some patent material . Out of its floors sprouted innumerable bolts , to which machines large and small were to be attached ; the concrete was covered with cabalistic signs in various colored crayons . Overheadwere trolleys on which airplane parts would be carried , swingingfrom steel chains . Everything had been planned to the fraction of an inch , and the blueprints were numerous enough to have coveredthe floor of the building . Part of it was a great foundry , and a power plant was already belching black smoke , making electricity for the construction work and the lighting at night . Already some of the machines were arriving , mysterious in their waterproof wrappings .

" He was doing the honors personally , because Irma was his largest single stockholder and was entitled to know just what her money was buying . She was greatly impressed and asked many questions , showing that she was thinking not merely about her money but about the work it was going to do . Lanny was content to look and let the others talk . He believed in machinery and the power it gave to humankind , but he was ill satisfied with the uses to which it was being put . He dreamed of seeing it collectively owned and serving collective purposes ; but there was no use saying a word about this to either his father or his wife . These two belonged together , for they understood and supplemented each other . Irma had the " stuff , " and Robbie put it to use for her ; they would share the profits , and expect the rest of the world to work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were dissatisfiedwith the arrangement there would be a company police force  --  already it was being organized and taught its duties by that dependableex-cowboy Bub Smith , who had taught Lanny how to shoot guns , and had pretended to be a Socialist while acting as bodyguard to Baby Frances at Bienvenu . The consequences of Robbie 's social theories became apparent to Lanny while passing through the district surrounding the plant . Robbieexpected to have a thousand skilled men at work in a month or two , but it had n't occurred to him to make arrangements to get them here or provide them with places to live . All that , according to the master 's philosophy , was a matter for private enterprise . The men would be skilled workers , getting good pay and having their own cars , and Robbie did his part by setting aside a tract of the company'sland on which their cars could be parked . Where the men were going to have their homes was up to them , and the matter was being settled by a swarm of speculators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing to buy up the adjoining land . Now there were " subdivisions , " and busy salesmen marking out lots with little colored flags , and bringing people in busses from the cities to look at the land and eat free lunches of hot dogs and coffee . Alreadyscores of workers ' homes were arising ; they would be jerry/built , with silly little pretenses at elegance but nothing substantial , and as a result the workers would soon be putting in their spare time mending leaky roofs and cracked plaster and windows and doors that got stuck . But all that was their look-out , not the company 's . It was the thought of starry-eyed New Dealers that housing-projects might be constructed at the same time as new factories ; that parks and schools and playgrounds might be provided for workers ' families from the very outset . That was done as a matter of course in the Soviet Union , and that fact was enough to damn it for the rugged individualists of New England . Lanny knew there would n't be any use mentioning the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen years  --  ever since he had met the first Pink while a pupil at St. Thomas 's Academy in Connecticut . He knew in advance every word his father would say ; Robbie intended to institute what was called " welfare work " in the new plant , as soon as things got going and he had time to think about it ; but he did n't ask Lanny to help , . and Lanny knew why  --  because from the first moment the question of labor unions would come up , and Robbie was going to run an open-shop plant or die in the effort . " Free labor , " he called it , and meant by the phrase that the men were free to do what he told them or move elsewhere and do the same for some other hard-headed industrialist . The men who had charge of the providing of rest places and recreation for the workers would n't be " cranks " picked out by Lanny , but sensible fellows who knew where their salaries came from . They would organize baseball teams and bowling-tournaments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogans . So Robbie Budd was in triumphant course of producing another center of industrial feudalism in a land which preached democracy and government by popular consent . Robbie 's new town would n't be called a company town , and it would n't be company-owned , but would be company-run by devices which Robbie did n't have to invent , for they were standard practice in this sweet land of liberty . The workers had come swarming from nobody knew or cared where ; they would n't know one another and would have no ties or loyalties . They would be free to vote for political candidates every year orp206two , and they would assume that these candidates were crooks , and for the most part they would be right . Robbie or one of his agents would appoint a political boss to run the town , and at election time would put up campaign funds to elect the candidates whom the boss had chosen . If any men were active in opposing the company 's wishes , whether as to policies , unionism , or anything else , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . Such was the system , and Lanny knew that he wanted no part in it . If he was planning to denounce it , good taste required him to begin somewhere else but the place where his wife 's money and his father 's time , energy , and reputation were being thrown into the pot . From a safe distance of three thousand miles the amateur publicist watched events in the unhappy Continent on which he had been born . He saw them through the medium of newspaper dispatches written by men whom he knew ; also of letters from Rick , and Raoul Palma , and one to his father from Denis de Bruyne . At the beginning of May the French signed a treaty of mutual defense with the Soviet Union , and Denis said that it represented an effort to bluff Germany . But in order to bluff successfully you have to look as if you meant it , and France did n't mean it . Hitler knew it well , and took the treaty as a basis of propaganda attacks . Pierre Laval meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Chamber for ratification , nor was it implemented by any military arrangements . Marianne would n't trust her new ally with any of her defense secrets  --  and what sort of ally was that ? At the end of the month the fripon mongol became Premier  --  a sort of booby prize , Rick said , for having proved himself the most inept of living French statesmen . Early in June , Ramsay MacDonald was replaced as Prime Minister of Britain ; poor old packhorse for the Tories , he had carried them as far as he could , and now they set him down to rest and dream in a pasture called the Lord Presidency of the Council . His place was taken by a steel manufacturer namedp207Baldwin , whose specialties were pipe-smoking and pig-raising . " Englandalso has her two hundred families , " wrote Rick , " and they do n't have to hide themselves behind the mask of an innkeeper 's son . " The first act of this new " jumped-up blacksmith " was the treaty for naval parity with Germany , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talked about it . Now John Bull kindly gave the Germans permission to build up to thirty-five per cent of his own sea-power and actually included the right to parity in submarinebuilding . The tiger that had been let out of his cage was now ' invited into the family dining-room  --  though of course seated near the foot of the table . Benito Mussolini , Blessed Little Pouter Pigeon , was bound by no less than nine treaties to respect the independence and territorial integrityof that ancient land called Abyssinia and sometimes Ethiopia ; but he was going right ahead with his propaganda against it , and shipping soldiers and supplies to his Red Sea bases . This was an excellentthing for the British , who owned most of the stock of the Suez Canal Company and collected goodly sums for every ton of shipping and every soldier traveling through that long sandy ditch . It was also excellent for the New England-Arabian Oil Company which Robbie Budd had founded and recently sold out to Zaharoff and his associates ; they were right there with the fuel which Mussolinicould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food and wine and oil of the Italian people . Lord Wickthorpe went with a British mission to negotiate with " the blighter , " and when he came back he told Rick about it , and Rick wrote it to Lanny on his old battered typewriter . Bit by bit , like careful traders , the British had offered I1 Duce everything he could hope to get , asking only that he should proceed under the forms of legality and let the League hand it to him on a golden platter ; but no , he was determined to take it by force , for the sake of the effect on his domestic situation . Some forty years ago these black fighting-men  --  a mysterious race supposed to be descended from wanderingJews  --  had given invading Italian troops an awful licking , and I1 Duce wanted the glory of wiping out that disgrace . He saw him- self going out there and receiving the submission of the " Lion of Judah , " then coming home in a triumphal procession and building a monument to himself in the Forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion . Four years previously the Tories had got into power in a snap election , in which , polling fifty-five per cent of the vote , they had got ninetyoneper cent of the House of Commons . Now the British people had proceeded to organize independently and take a poll of eleven and a half millions of themselves , and they had voted something like thirty to one in favor of staying in the League . They had voted thirteen to one in favor of prohibiting the manufacture and sale of armaments for private profit  --  imagine the feelings of Robbie Budd when he opened his paper and read that item of news ! With Mussolini 's Africanadventure before them , these amateur voters had been asked if a nation which insisted upon attacking another nation should be stopped by economic and non-military measures , and they had answered Yes by fifteen to one . Asked whether such an aggressor nation should be stopped by military measures , they had answered Yes by nearly three to one . In the face of such a vote Mussolini brought to completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League of Nationsgoing to do about it ? What was the Tory government of Britain going to do about it ? Soon after his arrival at Shore Acres , Lanny had received a note from Trudi Schultz , forwarded from Bienvenu ; a duplicate of the one he had so nearly missed in Berlin . After that , nothing for a couple of months ; he had to accustom himself to thinking in a special way about these people who were " death 's own . " Their owner might have claimed them or they might be on the way to him by the route of dungeons and concentration camps . A letter might come , or it might not ; and there was no good fearing or worrying in the meantime . One came in the middle of July ; a real letter , the longest he had ever received from Trudi : " I am very busy , illustrating a work ofp209fiction dealing with the time of the Emperor Diocletian . The heroine is a persecuted Christian who has to flee ; there are several scenes of vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you know , my drawings have so far dealt with still life . I should value your opinion of my work highly , and hope you will be visiting Berlin . I am expecting to move and not sure of my address but will get in touch with you when I hear of your arrival . It is convenient that you are a famous person whose comings and goings are reported in the press . By the way , my clerical friend has been ill for some time and is confined to his bed . I do not know just what is the matter with him ; he does not talk about his ailments . Hoping that this finds you and your family well and the picture business thriving , I am , respectfully , Kornmahler . " Lanny did n't need to spend much effort interpreting this elaborate parable . Trudi was being sought by the Gestapo and was in hiding ; she could n't give an address , but wished him to come to Berlin and find some way to get himself and his picture business into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clerical friend , of course , was Monck , and she was telling the tragic news that he was in a concentration camp but was not betraying his friends . Serious news indeed for the grandson of Budd 's . Maybe the man had n't talked yet , but he might talk tomorrow , and his first statementwould be that the money for the criminal activities of his group was being put up by an American playboy who posed as a friend of the Gestapo General , and , indeed , was getting his money by acting as an art broker for the Nazi second-in-command . That would be of genuine interest to the Secret State Police ; and what would they do about it ? The question called for no little guessing . An art lover of imaginative temperament could spend hours , especially the wee small ones in the morning , picturing scenes with the fat General , and with the acting head of his Gestapo , a former schoolteachernamed Himmler who had managed to make himself the most dreaded individual on the continent of Europe . Lanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany ! " But very soon he began having second thoughts . Trudi had n't been obliged to tell him about Monck ; she had taken a risk doing it  --  and why ? Obviously , in order to be fair . She was saying : " The danger is greater ; perhaps you wo n't want to come . " And what was his answer to be ? Should he say : " The danger is too great , and I give up " ? If he said that , what would Trudi think of him ? What would he think of himself ? For more than half a year he had been maintaining his self-respect on the basis that now he was really doing something worth while . He had won new regard from Rick on the basis of being no longer an idler and parasite . Should he now say : " The job was too risky , and I had to quit " ? Or should he merely keep quiet , and let Rick go on thinking of him as something he did n't dare to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . He had been justifying his life of luxury by the fact that he met his clients that way , kept up his prestige , and so made his picture deals . Clients would repose confidence in a social equal , but hardly in a subordinate , a professional no matter how truly qualified : such was the world of snobbery . So Lanny made money easily and abundantly ; but what did he want it for ? So that he could buy new suits of clothes whenever his wife or his mother cast a critical glance at one he was wearing ? Or whenever those public enemies , the fashion creators , decided that coats must have three buttons instead of two , or that lapels should be an inch longer and have an angle somewhat more acute ? Lanny 's thoughts were continually occupied with those comrades in Germany ; not only Trudi , but all who were helping her . They were not vague abstractions to him ; he had met a score of them , and their names , faces , and personalities haunted him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another 's homes , or in the receptionroom of the school , drinking coffee and eating Leibnitz Keks-a modest proletarian form of celebration  --  and talking about their cause , what it meant to them and how they hoped to make it prevail . They had used large and noble words : Freibeit and Gerechtigkeit , Bruderlich. keit and Karneradschaft . They had quarreled overp211points of doctrine and tactics , they had been irritated with one another , they had displayed petty jealousies ; but it had always been understood that deeper than all such things was the powerful bond between them . They were comrades in a sacred cause , human beings in a world of wolves , civilized men surrounded by barbarians , producersin a society of exploiters , plunderers , and parasites . And now , did all that mean anything ? Was it a real moral force , or had it been only fine phrases , a form of self-indulgence , a system of pretenses , a means of self-advancement for the intellectuals and a whim or diversion for the idle rich ? Lanny could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them as an investigator , that he had wished to understand their movement among many others . No , he had told them that he was a " comrade " ; he had encouraged them to fight Nazism , assuring them of his own democratic sentiments and of the moral support of all decent and right-thinking men . They had acted on those promises and those hopes . They had done what they could  --  not all of them , of course , for no movement is perfect . For their weaknesses of character and errors of judgment they had paid frightful penalties and would pay more . The weaklings had dropped out , and a little group , perhaps a mere handful , was carrying on the fight , trying to keep the spark alive , to save the soul of the future . Trudi had n't told Lanny what they were doing . She had assumed that there was no need to do so . Lanny had been in the movement for years and had known some of its great leaders . She and Ludi had poured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth their ideas in detail , and Lanny had agreed with them . He had said to himself : " Here are two people who understand not merely the economic forces which move society , but the moral forces which move the souls of men . " That combination of understanding was rare , and these four young idealists , three men and one woman , had merged their souls and their labors . They had forged weapons for the future  --  and now it appeared that only two of them were left alive to put the weapons to use . Lanny did n't have to guess what was going on , for the undergroundmovement against Hitler had been pretty well written up in the neighboring lands ; even the capitalist press had now and then printed news of it . There was a " flash-sender , " as the Germans call it , a secret radio transmitter , hidden somewhere in the country , and every now and then it would start up , revealing forbidden news , exposingofficial falsehoods , tormenting the Nazis with jeering comments . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly located , but it kept moving ; it must be carried in a van or covered car , and the powers of the Gestapo had been set to hunting it  --  so far without success . Also there were secret printing-presses ; leaflets were printed or mimeographed , and would be found on the benches of workers when they came in the morning , or perhaps in their dinner-pails at noon . Very often it would be the Socialists attacking the Communists , or vice versa  --  they still kept up their factional disputes , even in the concentration camps . But Lanny could be sure that Trudi was not takingany part in that , because she had agreed with him in deploring the blunder . She would be exposing the fraudulent Socialism of the Nazis and pointing out to the workers how they were being led into the path of war . These heroic people were depending upon Lanny for their funds . He knew enough about left-wing movements to understand that they would have dropped efforts to get funds elsewhere and be devotingthemselves to spending what he sent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way for him to notify them not to expect more ; they would wait and go on waiting  --  in the same unhappystate of mind which he had known in Berlin , waiting for word from Trudi . The flash-sender would fall silent because they had no money for new batteries or gasoline for the car ; the leaflets would no longer be distributed because there was no paper . Trudi might write to him  --  or more likely , she would give him up in disgust , and he would never hear from her again , never know whether she was alive or dead . But he , the young lord of Shore Acres , would be safe and comfortable , and if there was anything in the world that money could buy , he could have it for the asking . Everything save his peace of mind !  |p213He  had managed to find purchasers for a couple more of Goring 's paintings ; and after a week or two of wrestling within himself he said to his wife : " How would you like to take another run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go alone , but tact required that he invite her . As it happened , Irma had just received a letter from Margy , the very sporty Dowager Lady Eversham-Watson . Being nearly sixty , she ought to have known that she was " on the shelf , " but she refused to . With the proceeds of the rapidly reviving business of whiskydistillingshe had got herself a yacht , and instead of being content to invite Beauty and Sophie and other ladies of her own age she craved the society of the young . So , would n't Irma and Lanny be her guests for the regatta week at Cowes ? It was a great show , which Lanny had seen but Irma had n't . Irma said : " Poor old Margy 's a bore , but I imagine it will be rather swank  --  what do  --  you think ? " What Lanny thought was : " O.K. , let 's go ! " And so began one of those periods of agreeable confusion in which you make plans and decisions . They would leave Frances here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted an invitation for a couple of weeks ' hunting on one of the estates of the South Carolina tidelands . Irma would take her maid , because you could n't participate in regatta festivities without a personal maid . But not too many clothes , because they would have several days in London to get yachtingtogs . Lanny would look kind of cute in such an outfit ; his wife would order one and order him to have it fitted . As a reward for his being so sweet , she would accompany him to Berlin and let him look at pictures for as long as he needed . They had to choose a steamer , and engage accommodations , and send cablegrams to friends . Lanny called his father and told him ; he called Johannes , and found that he had just had a cablegram from Hansi and Bess . The two musicians had left South America for a tour around the world and had got as far as Japan . Now they had learned of a Congress of the Comintern to be held in Moscow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of Vladivostok to take in this show . Lanny , too , had heard about this coming event . The Third Internationalhad summoned its parties all over the world to send delegates , to consult concerning the new emergency which confronted them in the upsurge of Fascism-Nazism . Rumor had it that a change in the party line was contemplated ; some sort of united front was to be set up with the Socialists and other liberal forces . This was what Lanny had been urging for many years ; he could say that the Cominternwas about to adopt his party line ! Having attended a dozen conferences of " bourgeois " statesmen , he would have greatly enjoyedattending one of revolutionists . But , alas , nobody could go from the Kremlin to Karinhall , or from Karinhall to the Kremlin ! He said to Irma : " We 'll meet Hansi and Bess when they come out , and hear all about it . " Irma said : " You can ! " Early one morning a procession set out from Shore Acres : two cars and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , with their five-year-old darling between them , and Miss Addington , the elderly English governess , in the back seat ; in the second car , Mrs. Barnes and Uncle Horace , driven by their chauffeur , and with one of their favored pensioners beside him . In the station-wagon rode Celeste , Irma 's Breton maid , and a load of trunks . They drove to the pier where the great Cunard liner was already rumbling her whistle . Lanny 's car had steel chains put under it and was lifted into the hold ; the trunks were piled into a heavy rope net and thus let down into another hold ; the three passengers and their guests went up by the gangplank , preceded by stewards carrying armfuls of their bags . Moving the rich about the world is a task involving a lot of labor for other people , but the rich themselves maintain a calm and unhurriedaspect .

When the call came : " All ashore that 's going ashore ! " she wanted violently to remain , and it was n't complimentary to her grandmother and her great-uncle . Irma had to promise to throw her a red paper ribbon , and for that she went eagerly . This pleasant custom had grown up in recent years . The steamshippeople furnished rolls of thin paper ribbon of bright colors ; the passenger held one end and tossed the roll to a friend on the pier , and he or she caught it , and so they were connected by symbolical bonds until the vessel began to move and all ties were severed . Irma tossed a red one , and it was caught and handed to the **31;8605;TOOLONG . Lanny tossed a blue one , and she wanted that also , and stood with a ribbon in each fist , carrying on with both parents a conversation of which they heard no word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be back soon ! " Lanny said this because it was the proper thing ; but inside him a voice whispered : " Oh , yeah ? " This voice had taken to speaking at intervals by day and night , and was pretty well spoiling Lanny 's enjoyment of the agreeable life which fate had assigned him . Irma noticed it , and would say : " What makes you so glum , Lanny ? " He would answer : " I 'm just thinking . " Irma was thinking , too , and guessing that her strange huh band was n't entirely cured of his Pink vice , and was brooding because the world did n't behave according to his formulas . Pressing against Lanny 's chest on his right side was a wad which he had wrapped in a handkerchief and kept pinned in his inside coat pocket . It contained a large number of hundred-mark notes , which he had acquired by visiting different money-changing agencies in New York , using care to attract no attention . One of the results of his meditations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had decided that he had taken a serious chance by going to his regular bank , drawing out a large sum , and passing it on to Trudi Schultz . Doubtless the bank had kept a record of the serial numbers of those notes . In Naziland , a record was kept of everything ; the hairs of your head were numbered , and if too many spar- rows fell to the ground in your garden the fact would be reported to the Polizei . Suppose one or more of those notes had been found on Comrade Monck or some other arrested person and the source of the funds had been traced ! This was just one of a great number of imaginations which were trying to ruin a yachting-regatta for Lanny Budd . IN THE month of August the weather man is apt to be less unfriendlyto the English , which is perhaps why the Cowes regatta is held at the beginning of that month . Yachtsmen and yacht lovers assemble from all the shores of Britain and indeed of the Atlantic ; the Solent is crowded with vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is new and shiny ; white sails , white paint , and spitand-polishbrass ; the sea green , or blue-green , with whitecaps when it breaks ; the sky a light blue , and the clouds like wind-filled sails . Everybody puts on nautical clothes and a holiday air , and nowhere on the scene is there the slightest sign of what the English hymnbook refers to as sorrow , toil , and woe . This was the jubilee year of the event , so there were jubilee cups offered by King George for the best records for yachts of various classes . There were several races each day , of various lengths , around certain buoys and lights outside the harbor ; sight-seeing vessels trooped out in the morning to follow the contenders , keeping politely off the course , shepherded by guard vessels with little flags to mark their authority and officials with megaphones to warn the careless . You stood by the rail , conscious of your sea-costume and also ofp217your sea-legs , and watched the contenders through binoculars which made it almost as if you were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vessels and their owners , and the records which they and their predecessors had established . You knew the " corrected times , " and even knew who had designed the various boats . It was a classic example of what Veblen calls " the conspicuousconsumption of goods " ; the frail craft were built for one purpose , to carry the utmost amount of sail and slide through the water at the utmost speed ; they cost thumping sums and in a couple of years were obsolete because some other designer had gone them one or two better . Therefore , when you joined a yachting crowd you were telling the world that you were tops financially and had been for some time . Late in the day you came back into the harbor of your boat club , sunburned and with salt in your eyebrows . You bathed and dressed in evening clothes and perhaps went ashore for dinner and dancing , or were invited to some other yacht , or had friends invited to yours . All talked about the day 's events , paid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first three days of this regatta the winds were featherlight , and that favored the English yachts ; in the last three days there were " spanking " breezes , which favored the American , which had to be a shade more substantial in order to cross the ocean . So there was plenty about which to wager and to work up patriotic excitement . Margy Petries , proprietor of " Petries ' Peerless , " was n't sure whether she favored the vessel called Yankee ; remembering she was also a dowager countess , she would consider " hedging " on her bets . There are always some bridge fiends who can not pass an evening without their rubber or two , and these would retire to the saloon . The young people would bring out phonographs and dance on deck . The vessels were closely crowded in their yacht-basins , and motorboatswere chugging this way and that ; but English decorum prevailedeven over the waters , and you danced to your own music , and enjoyed knowing that you were socially impeccable . King George went on board the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of Cowes , and it was " Hands across the Sea , " an admission that Britain was preparing to share her rule . Irma was so impressed that she said : " Lanny , do n't you think it would be fun to build one of these yachts and learn to sail it ? " She was always thinking about some gadget that might capture her husband 's fancy , and the more expensive it was the better , because , after all , if you could do things that nobody else could , were n't they the things to do ? Among the guests was what Margy called the " old crowd , " includingBeauty and her husband , and Sophie and her new husband  --  she might , according to the European custom , have kept her title though divorced and remarried , but she said that America was good enough for her , and this was considered a radical , almost revolutionaryaction . Also there came an old friend , Edna Fitz-Laing , of whose marital scandal Lanny had been an eye-witness in his boyhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a widow , rather poor , so Margy was being kind to invite her as well as a couple of elderly bachelors who might be attracted by her remnants of beauty . Two of them , with the idea that each might be jealous of the other ! There were enough bridge-players , and Lanny could sit on deck in the evening and chat with Rick . The baronet 's son and his wife were here because Margy knew this would please Lanny and cause him to bring his heiress to Margy 's affairs . That is the way to keep in the swim and build yourself into a social personality ; by understandingyour fellow-humans , their prejudices and desires ; by learninghow to mix them and make them have a good time . Lanny and Rick , a pair of social philosophers mature beyond their years , reclined on deck chairs and gazed at the golden stars in the clear sky , thinking of their distance , and how insignificant were the two-legged creatures dressing themselves up and strutting on a very small planet . How long the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allotted to the creatures  --  and what were they doing with it ? The newspapers came from the city , and you could study the details of their activities , at least those which the press lords consideredfit for your perusal . Both the art expert and the lame ex-aviator were students of this press , and had learned to read between the linesp219and draw conclusions different from what the vendors intended . Mussolini was admitting having sent more than a quarter of a milliontroops to Eritrea , his jumping-off place into the land of the Negus , known also as the Lion of Judah and King of Kings ; the ardent young Fascists were singing a song  --  you could get the lilt of it even in English : " Of the whiskers of the Negus we will make a little brush to polish off the boots of Mussolini ! " Their hero now had a million of them under arms , and while the lovely yachts were gliding over the blue waters of the Solent he mobilized three more : divisions . The League was continuing the farce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw , but they could n't get anywhere because the two Italian members of the arbitration board refused to join the two Abyssinian members in naming a fifth . It was plain to all the world that Mussolini was merely stalling until the end of the rainy season , a couple of months off . In the Geneva debates the Italians were having the ardent support of their friend the innkeeper 's son from Auvergne who was now Premier of France . In that land of revolutionary traditions the class war was being waged merrily ; there were strikes in the arsenals , accompanied by violence ; with the secret backing of Pierre Laval the Croix de Feu was practicing what it called " lightning mobilizations , " also the conversion to military purposes of the airplanes owned by its wealthy members . " I no longer care a hang for legality , " said Colonel de la Roque , its founder , and Lanny had been to their meetings and could imagine the yells with which his followers would greet this declaration . The American could tell about conditions in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large camps where they drilled . Just before his sailing they had held a meeting in Yorkville , the German quarter of the city , in which their uniformed guards had worn revolvers . The steamers of the German lines which came to the port brought loads of Nazi propaganda which was mailed out to their " Bund " headquarters all over the land . This had provoked a fury of indignation among the anti-Nazis , and they had mobbed the steamer Bremen at its sailing a week before Lanny 's own departure.  |p220Over  in Moscow the sessions of the Comintern were under way , and on the third day of the Cowes regatta , while the wind was light and the Enterprise was winning the forty-mile race for the big Class J yachts , the Bulgarian delegate Dimitroff made a fiery speech announcingplans for the " united front " against Fascism all over the world . This was the man whom Lanny had heard defending his life against the fat General Goring at the Reichstag fire trials less than two years ago . He had sought refuge in the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mistake , and that in future such men would be silenced at once and forever . On the day when the wind freshened and the Yankee won , the co-ordinated press of Naziland burst forth in furious onslaughts against the Comintern , calling upon the friends of order throughout the world to join with the Fuhrer in destroying this vipers ' nest . On the last day of the regatta the American Earl Browder called upon the Communists to broaden their appeal , so as to win the farmers and workers and middle-class elements of his country . From the Americanpress came indignant protests to the effect that Moscow was breaking the promise it had made as the price of American recognition , not to make Communist propaganda in the United States . To this Moscow had its answer : Moscow had nothing to do with what the Comintern did , the Comintern was an independent assemblage of delegates from all the countries of the world . When you confronted a diplomatic evasion such as that , what were you going to call it , a lie or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose all lies and fibs ? If so , you would have a busy life , for the world was lining up on opposite sides of a revolutionary struggle , and who in all history had ever waged war without falsehoods ? Certainly not anyone who had won his war ! Did n't every nation try to deceive its enemies as to its plans ? Did n't every nation send spies into the enemy nations and was n't deception the essence of their job ? Above all , who was Lanny Budd to raise this issue , being now on his way into Germany to do a fancy job of lying ? The gravest of moral problems confronted a social being in thesep221unhappy times . For when you let down the bars and admitted the right to lie and to cheat , you were undermining the very bases upon which human societies are built . Particularly when you admitted the right of political parties to lie and cheat , for how , then , could anybodyhave faith in them ? How could their own followers know what they were or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe you did n't have any ideal government to pin your hopes to ; you had a number of far from perfect governments and had to choose the least objectionable . If you took your stand on what you called fundamental moral principles , it was like retiring to a mountaintop , away from all human affairs ; you could live there like a hermit , or a Hindu mystic , gazing at your own navel  --  until the guns started shelling your mountain top , and the bombing-planes took it for an objective ! On Sunday morning the American couple motored to Wickthorpe Castle to spend the day and night . This was important for Lanny , because he met Gerald Albany and others of the government set and heard them discussing the problems of that very dangerous hour ; if he met Goring he would be able to repeat what they had said , of course withholding anything that was really confidential . He played no favorites , but told his English friends about his last meeting with the fat Commander of the German Air Force and what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was building , the many skilled pilots he was training , and how they were going to knock all enemy planes out of the air in the first hours of a war . Alas , this did n't do much harm to Goring , because Ceddy and his friends were serenely certain that the fat General was bluffing , trying to plant fear in their hearts against the day when Hitler would be ready to militarize the Rhineland , or whatever his next move might be . Irma knew no reason for being in a hurry , so on Monday they drove to London and she did some shopping and had her hair waved and enjoyed a leisurely tea with one of her women friends , while Lanny did his professional duty by looking at the offerings of the various picture dealers . In the evening they went to see a comedy which had been running all summer , called Tovarisch . It had to do with a Russian grand duke and his wife who were refugees in Paris , living in destitution because they would n't touch a huge sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his no-longer-existent government . It was reported that Herr Hitler had greatly enjoyed this play  --  after having taken the precaution to ascertain that its author was a pure Aryan ! Among great numbers of refugee " Whites " in Paris and on the Riviera , Lanny Budd had never met any who resembled these romanticfigures . When at the end the grand duke 's patriotic feelings caused him to turn the money over to the Soviet government , Lanny enjoyed the " happy ending " to a fairy tale . In the next morning 's papers , he read news of the Comintern Congress , also editorials of embittered loathing in the London press  --  but nothing either humorousor romantic . Old Europe was a kettle full of seething hatreds , and the only question was , at what moment would it boil over and in which direction would the scalding stream flow ? There came a letter from Irma 's friend the Furstin Donnerstein , who was spending the hot season in a chalet on the Obersalzberg , near the Austrian border . She called it " little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of guest rooms . " Do come and see it , " she pleaded . " Berlin is absolutely impossible in August . From our upstairs veranda you can see the Berghof , the eagle 's eyrie where our great Fiihrer hides , and perhaps Lanny will take you to visit him . " She had heard of the playboy 's having had this great honor , one which neither she nor her husband had ever enjoyed . " How about it ? " asked Irma ; and Lanny responded : " Would you really like to meet Hitler ? " She said it might be amusing , and certainly it would be an adventure to tell her friends about . Lanny thought : " Whatever 1 can get Adi to reveal about his plans will be of use to Rick , and to Blum and Longuet , and Raoul Palma , perhaps even to Trudi . Certainly they 'll take it more seriously if I get it from the horse 's mouth . " To his wife he said : " I 'll ask Heinrich Jung about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see his oldest Nazi friend on recent trips , partly because Lanny himself had been too busy , and partly because Irma found Heinrich and his wife such bores . That was the one thing which the daughter of J. Paramount Barnes refused to endure , and Lanny planned to take advantage of that trait in Berlin . He would have to get away from Irma in order to see Trudi , and it might not be so easy when all her friends were out of town . But if he went to see Heinrich at the latter 's office , and if this fanatical enthusiast took him to see some Hitler Youth demonstration , or school , or recreation center  --  those were things which would move Irma to remark : " I 'll go to a picture show by myself ! " There was n't any need to telegraph reservations to the Adlon in the midst of summer heat , but Lanny did so and specified the hour of his arrival . He did n't have to mention that he wanted the reporters to be on hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted that all patrons do the same . So when the American party arrived , the press was in the lobby , watching respectfully a procession composed of one heiress , one prince consort , one maid , and three bellboys loaded with four suitcases apiece . Seated in the drawing-room of their suite , Lanny ordered drinks for the reporters and told them about the Cowes regatta , the art treasures he meant to purchase , and the visit he purposed in the neighborhood of the Fuhrer 's retreat . Every Berlin newspaper had accounts of Lanny 's last interview with the nation 's idol , and this made it certain that he would get space in the morning . " Kornmahler " would see these items , and there should be a letter very soon . Lanny figured that it might arrive by mid-afternoon ; and meanwhilehe would be the most attentive of husbands , so as to excuse himself for later neglect . The weather was warm and sultry , and he said : " How would you like to drive to one of the lakes and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once a swampy forest inhabited by aurochs , bears , and barbarians , were lakes enough for all the population of a metropolis to sail on and swim in . But on a weekday rnorning nearly all that population was at work , and visitingAmericans could have boat-houses and bathing-pavilions to themselves . The hotel porter would tell them where to find the most exclusive , and they could pass a pleasant morning and afterward have lunch . Irma would n't stop to wonder what they were waiting for , because she had all the time there was in her life . When they got back to the hotel , there was the expected note , the briefest possible : " I have some sketches which I hope you will like . I would be pleased if you come at twenty-two o'clock any evening that is convenient to you . " That was all . Trudi had never before asked him to come at night , and he guessed that it was because she no longer dared to appear on the streets by daylight . Lanny 's first thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening . But the fates were more than kind to him ; there came a telephone call from the Frau Ritter von Fiebewitz , who happened to be in town , on her way from the mountains to the seashore ; would n't they come and have supper with her  --  an impromptuaffair , since she had only one servant with her ? Irma wanted to go , and Lanny said : " I 'll tell you what : I 'll take you there and leave you , and then I 'll take Heinrich to dinner and save you the boredom . If you 're not present , he wo n't expect his wife to be invited . I 'll drive him home afterwards , and your friend can bring you to the hotel , no doubt . " " Or I can take a taxi , " said the young wife , amiably . It had worked out like a bit of magic . The son of the head forester of Stubendorf had risen to high rank in that branch of the party machine which had charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jung still saw Lanny Budd as the darling of fortune who had come visiting , spreadingan aura of elegance , chatting airily about the great ones of Europe'scapitals . The National Socialists considered themselves revolutionistsand destroyers of Europe 's old culture , but only the crudestp225and most fanatical had freed themselves entirely from its spell ; thus to his Nazi friend Lanny was still a romantic figure , received as a guest at Schloss Stubendorf and recognized by the gleichgeschaltete Presse of Berlin . Before Heinrich came to the Adlon to dine , he took the trouble to hurry home and put on his dress-uniform , much too warm and smelling strongly of moth-balls . When he met his brilliant friend his blue Nordic eyes shone with happiness and his rosy Nordic cheeks which had grown plumper with the years acquiredtwo naive and quite charming dimples . " Ach , Lanny ! " he exclaimed . " When are you going to come out for us ? " " What do you want me to do ? " smiled the host . " Put on a uni-form ? " " Warum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a distinguishedcareer . In no time at all you could become the Gauleiter of New England . Our people over there are not doing so very well . " " All my friends in New England think I am a foreigner , " replied Lanny . " They would not follow my lead . " He asked what Heinrich was doing at present , and , as always , this started a flood . The Nazi official had been on the point of calling up , to beg Lanny to come with him on the morrow to Nurnberg . There was a National Socialist school for selected young men who had been brought from all the nations of the earth  --  fifteen hundred students chosen for their special aptitudes from fifty-one different lands ; they were the future national Fuhrers and world masters . Heinrich had been chosen to lecture them about the Hitlerjugend and how this marvelous organization had been built during the past decade . The term of the school was closing , and there would be impressiveceremonies , including memorial services in front of the War Monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymns , all that ritual which thrilled the soul of a pure Nordic Herrenmensch . " Lanny , you would n't be able to resist it ! " " Perhaps that is why I do n't go , " replied the irreverent American . " I could n't settle down and work as hard as you , Heinrich ; but I admireyou for it , all the same . " The cheeks of the head forester 's son glowed with pleasure , and Lanny signed to the waiter to fill up his glass . The lavish host had ordered a liter of the best French champagne and would see that his friend drank the greater part of it . " As a matter of fact I 'm really busy right now , " the host continued . " I am selling some of Minister-President General Goring 's paintings for him . He has rather extraordinary taste , you know , and I find it instructive as well as profitable to co-operate with him . " Lanny talked with easy familiarity about Karinhall , and Emmy , and the wonderful wedding-gifts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boars  --  taking the hunter 's word for it . Since Lanny 's visit to the preserve , official announcement had been made of the film star 's intention to retire and present the German people with an heir , and this stirred in Heinrich that philoprogenitive instinct which characterizesa Herrenvolk on its way to power and glory . All through dinner the American listened to good Nazi propaganda ; then he took his friend up to the suite , where they had coffee and brandy , and Heinrich talked about the sad fate of his one-time friend Hugo Behr and others who had been so tragically misled as to oppose the Fuhrer 's will . The international situation now showed how right the Fiihrer had been ; how Germany 's freedom could be won by boldness and in no other way . Heinrich quoted a speech recently made by General Goring to the effect that he wanted and would have " no dishwater internationalism " in the Fatherland . Lanny , who had pleaded at the Paris Peace Conference against the cutting off of Stubendorf from the German Republic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy with anything the Fiihrer saw fit to do ; so the listener had only to go on listening . Presently there was a chance to change the subject . Lanny remarked : " Irma and I are planning to drive to Salzburg tomorrow , to visit a friend in the mountains there . I wish we could drive you as far as Nurnberg , Heinrich , but Irma has her maid along , and with all the bags she 's about buried . " " Oh , that 's all right , " replied the other . " There 's a party car going with three of us. "  | " This occurred to me , " continued the other . " It might be good form for us to drop in and pay our respects to the Fiihrer , if you think he would like it . " " Oh , Lanny , I 'm sure he would ! I wish I could go , too ; but youknow how it is  --  I can not neglect an important duty to our youth . " " Of course not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youlike to phone and find out if he would care to receive us ? " " Gewiss , if you wish it . " " Well , why not put in a call from here ? " Heinrich was greatly excited by this honor , and Lanny knew the hotel staff would be the same ; he guessed that before the call had been completed the whole of the immense establishment would know what was going on . Heinrich spoke the portentous words with proud distinctness : " Hallo . Heil Hitler ! Bitte , des Fiihrers Heim , Der Berghof , in Berchtesgaden , Obersalzberg . " After that he could hardly sit still in his chair , and could talk about nothing but , should he ask to speak to the greatest of men personally , and would the greatest come ? Lanny , who had had much to do with the great , advised that the proper procedure was to ask for the Fuhrer 's secretary ; there was pretty sure to be one on duty at all times . Avoid attempting to give an importantmessage to butlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may get names wrong , especially foreign names . Lanny knew that Heinrich 's own name was one of power , because in his youth he had twice visited Adi in prison and that was something the ex-painter of picture postcards would never forget . The phone rang and Heinrich picked up the receiver with a trembling hand . Lanny listened to the conversation : " Hallo . 1st dort Der Berghof ? Heil Hitler . Flier Heinrich Jung . Wollen Sie mich bitte nit den Sekretcir des Fiihrers verbinden ? Ja ? Danke schon . " A wait , and then : " Sekretar des Fiihrers ? Heil Hitler . Hier spricht Heinrich Jung , Gruppenf iihrerstellvertreter des f iin f ten Gaus der Reichsjugend fiihrung and ein alter Freund des Fiihrers . Heil Hitler . " So much for preliminaries , and Heinrich went on to explain that the American Lanny Budd and his multimillionaire wife  --  Heinrich had n't had to be told to mention this  --  were motoring to the vicinity of the Berghof , and Herr Budd , who had already twice met the Fiihrer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects . Again there was a wait , longer this time , and at last a beaming smile exploded upon the round Aryan features of the Hitler Youth official . " Ja , jai Bitte , einen Augenblick . " He turned to Lanny . " The Fuhrer will see you tomorrow evening at twenty-two o'clock . Can you be there ? " " Sure , I 'll be there . " Since Lanny did n't intend to load himself up with the pictures until he was ready to leave Germany , he had nothing to do but see Trudi this evening , and could start early next morning . He was n't surprised by the lateness of the appointment , knowing that Adi suffered from insomnia and kept late hours . Of course he did n't fail to thank his old friend for this honor . Few persons in the Fatherland could have done this , he said , and added that he and his wife would be careful not to say a word which would trouble the great man , who sought this retreat in the high mountains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . It was then a little after nine o'clock , or twenty-one continental . Lanny said he had an engagement to meet his wife , and hoped that Heinrich would n't mind being sent home in a taxicab . The head forester 's son said he had n't got that important yet , so Lanny escortedhim downstairs  --  flushed in the cheeks and extremely talkative with mixed liquors  --  and put him into a car , paying the driver twice what the fare could amount to . " Heil Hitler fur dick and grass Gott fur die Frail ! " said Lanny , knowing that his friend 's plump little spouse came from Bavaria . Lanny got his car and drove , and promptly on the stroke of twenty-two  --  a great many strokes to count  --  he was at the corner where for the past eight months or so he had been meeting his fellowconspirator . His heart was in his throat ; for suppose she did n't come , or  --  just supposing !  --  there should come in her stead one of the armoredcars of the Gestapo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  |p229But  no , here she was ! Wearing a hat with a wide brim , which shaded her features from the street lights and the moon ; walking fast , and looking neither to right nor to left . Lanny drew up to the curb not far ahead , and she sprang in quickly , saying : " Drive ! " His high-powered car started away , and he asked : " Is anybody followingyou ? " Her answer was : " They have been following me everywhere . " He turned a corner , and watched for car lights behind him or for a car without lights . After several turns he was sure they were safe for the time being , and said : " You can rest for a while ; nobody is going to pay any attention to you in this car . " " Oh , Lanny ! " she exclaimed . " I have been having the most dreadfultime ever since I saw you last . I 've hardly had a day of peace . The police got on our trail , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible to talk about or even to think about . " " You had better tell me a little , " he said , gently . " After all , I am in it too , you know . " " That is one of the things that have made me sick . I waited a couple of months , trying to make up my mind whether I ought to bring you back into Germany again . " " All the Nazis appear glad to see me . I have an appointment to call on the Fiihrer at Berchtesgaden tomorrow evening . " " Herrgott , Lanny ! You might kill him ! " " Would you advise me to ? " He thought it worth while to make sure . " I did n't mean that . I mean , they would n't let you near him if they had any suspicion of you . " " I have beer consoling myself with that idea . I do n't suppose he wants the pleasure of torturing me personally . Tell me what you have been doing , so that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an underground paper  --  fifty thousand copies of a tiny four-page weekly , with the real news . They got our press and our printer , and two of our key men who were doing the distributing . " " So you 've had to quit ? " " For the present . I am afraid to go about , because they have myp230picture on a sheet which they distribute . Twice they have arrested the people with whom I have been staying , and that is the most awful thing to me ; I do n't know what to do  --  I give the kiss of death wherever I go . " " Trudi , " he said , gravely , " how much do you really know about Monck ? " " Oh , Lanny , you mean that you suspect him ? He has been one of our most devoted comrades ; he 's a marine engineer , a skilled man , and he has worked in the party since he was a youth . " " How did it happen that the Nazis spared him until just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have done . Believe me , I thought long and hard over the right man to send to you . It is easier for a seaman to go abroad than for a woman . I am sure he would have betrayed you at once if he had meant to . The Gestapo does n't wait to strike , and they would never have let you come into Germany and distribute large sums of money if they had any hint of it . " " Do you know anybody known to Monck who is still at large and working for the cause ? " She thought for a while . " Yes , I do ; at least I think I do . You can never be sure from hour to hour . That is the most trying thing about the life we live . You go to a friend 's room , thinking to find shelter for the night , and you are afraid to tap on the door , because it may be opened by a man in uniform . No use trying to run ; he will shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk . " " Well , Trudi , " he said , " I do n't know what to advise . If you ca n't function any longer , I 'm ready to help you get out . " " Oh , I ca n't desert the comrades ! So many of them , in such dreadfultrouble ! We all pledged ourselves to carry on . " " Yes ; but it 's possible to edit and print a paper in France or in Holland and to smuggle copies in . I might be able to help you with that and still keep my part a secret , so that I could continue to earn money . " " It is something to think about ; but I am staying with a family now whose head is an old printer , and he thinks he can find a way to buy a hand-press , so that we can go on . " " All right , " he answered ; " if that is what you want , here 's fivep231thousand marks . I took the precaution to buy them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think they can be traced . " He had hidden the precious wad in his car while entering Germany , and on the way to this rendezvous he had dug it out . Now he put it into her hands . " I do n't know if I ought to take it , " she countered . " I 'm not sure if I can use it to advantage , the way I 'm having to live now . " " Forget it , " he replied . " You have to live in any case , and so do your friends . What can I do better with Goring 's money ? " Meetings with Trudi Schultz were few and costly . Lanny did n't expect to see her again on this trip , so he had tried to think of all the questions he had to ask and the arrangements he had to make . He did n't ask for details of her work or the names of those who had been seized by the Nazis . He remembered many whom he had met in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he left them in the shadows . She asked whether his wife had any idea of his activities , and he said he did n't think so . He defended Irma as well as he could ; she was what her environment had made her , and she was still young . He told his fellow-conspirator that he was expecting to return to New York , and gave her his address there . Also they agreed upon certain code words , the names of painters , so that she could tell him if she needed a printing-press , or paper , or whatever it might be . Lanny had once brought a van-load of Marcel 's works into Germany for exhibition , and he could repeat that stunt if necessary , concealing quite a quantity of goods under a hundred paint-ings ! Finally she said : " I 'm afraid to travel in the subway , and I had to walk a long distance here , so I 'll let you set me down in the SchOnebergdistrict , where I am living now . " He drove according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down , he said : " You know , I 'm not curious about where you 're living , but I hate to put you down at random , not knowing how things may be . Ca n't I drive you through your block and let you have a look ? Then I 'll drive around the block a couple of times so that if you find anything has gone wrong you can come out and join me . " She told him the block , one of scores all alike , as in modern capitals . Scarcely had they driven into it when she caught his arm and whispered : " There are two cars in front of the house ! Turn around ! " He saw the cars , facing his way , and knew they could start and catch up with him while he was backing and turning in a not very wide street . " Sit still ! " he commanded . " Sink down in the seat ! Lay your head on my shoulder ! " He sat forward slightly , so as to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this position they drove past the two cars . At the wheel of each Lanny saw that most dreadful of sights , the Schutzstaffel uniform , steel helmet and black shirt with armband containing the skull and crossbones . One glimpse was enough , and after that he drove with eves straight ahead , not altering his speed . It was his guess that a man with a fancy foreign-made car , driving a young woman on a summer 's night , would not arouse special interest in the Gestapo . When he got farther down the street and saw in his little mirror the cars remaining where they were , he hit it up and turned the next corner , and got quickly out of the Schoneberg district of Berlin . Trudi Schultz had sunk into a heap , shaken with sobs . At first he thought it was the reaction from her terror , but then he realized that she was not thinking about herself . " Oh , Lanny , those poor people ! They will be dragged away to some cellar by those devils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gone . " " Do they know ? " asked the man , thinking about himself for once . " Nein , ausgeschlossen ! I told them I was going to interview a man who can get us some paper without the police tracing it . But , Lanny , if you knew them ! The most devoted comrades , workers who have toiled all their lives and put their pfennigs into party duesp233and literature ! The man 's face lined and hair turned gray too early , and the woman thin and harassed , with work-worn hands and forearmsthat seem to be nothing but whipcords . And two children  --  a half-grown boy and a girl  --  the S.S. will torture them , too . It does no good to say you do n't know anything ; they do n't believe you , they go on whipping you senseless , they make your whole body one mass of raw wounds . " " I know , " Lanny said . " I have seen it with my own eyes . " He let her have another spell of weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . mind to work . " Listen , my dear . You know I have a date with Irma , and I ca n't go on driving all night . " " Yes , yes , I understand . I am imposing on you cruelly . Put me down any place . " " But where do you mean to go ? " " I have n't an idea . I ca n't think of another family that would dare to take me in  --  or that I would have the right to impose upon . " " Ca n't I take you somewhere out of town ? " " What good would it do ? If I go to a hotel , or take lodgings , I have to register with the police within twenty-four hours , and I have to show my identification card , which I destroyed long ago . I am an outlaw . " " Well , my dear , you ca n't just go on walking about the streets ; and you certainly must know that I would n't be happy driving off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ; and after an interval he decided that the time for action had come . " Listen , Trudi , " he said , " we have an old saying , that he who fights and runs away may live to fight anotherday . I 'm going to take you out of Germany . " " How can you do it ? " she asked . " That is something that will require thinking . But first I want to know , will you come ? " There was a pause . " All right , " she said , at last , her voice low , as if it hurt . " Gut ! " he exclaimed . " The first thing , I have to tell my wife , becausewe shall need her help . " " Will she give it , Lanny ? "  | " She wo n't like it , of course ; but it will not be possible for her to refuse . " " I do n't want to come between you and her , Lanny . " " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensible person , also kind-hearted . When she realizes the situation , she will not wish to throw you to the wolves . " " Will you tell her the whole story ? " " I must think about that . The first thing is to get you into the hotel . " " Aber , Lanny ! You are dreaming of taking me into the Adlon ? " " You will be surprised what a difference it will make when you get some of Irma 's clothes on . They 'll be a bit large , but she will walk on one side of you and I on the other and I do n't think anyone will pay any special attention . " " But if I 'm to spend the night there , I 'll have to register . " " You 'll go in late , and you 'll be leaving in the morning , and I doubt if they 'll realize the situation before that . " " Lanny , I could get you into horrible trouble ! " " I doubt it , really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't believe the Nazis would want a scandal . I have a perfectly good story if it comes to a showdown : you are an artist and I am a Kunstsachverstdndiger ; I helped to get your drawings published in France , and I gave you financial aid because I expected to sell your work and make money out of it . I had no idea of your illegal doings . By the way , you had better give me back that money until we get out of Germany . It 'll be more natural for me to have it than you . " Lanny parked the car boldly in front of the hotel . He had put Trudi in the rear seat , and told her to lie back so that her face was out of sight . If anyone spoke to her she would say that she was waiting for Herr Budd ; but he doubted if anyone would speak , unless he left the car too long . The keys to his suite were still at the desk , so Irma had not returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw intop235an empty suitcase a dress of dark-blue silk , not too conspicuous , a hat to match , and shoes and stockings . Whatever Trudi wore had to be complete ; a pair of brown cotton stockings would have been as much a giveaway as a red Socialist badge . He took the precaution to phone to Celeste , Irma 's maid , who was in the hotel , telling her to go to bed , as her services would not be required that evening . Then he hurried down to the car and drove away . Trudi pulled down the side and rear curtains , and changed her clothes quickly . What to do with the old ones was a problem , suggestive of a murder mystery . It would n't do to have them found in the hotel or in the car . After she had assured him that there were no marks of identificationon her clothing , no papers in pockets and no laundry marks , he told her to tie the whole lot into a tight ball , and when he was crossing the River Spree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the parapet . Now Trudi Schultz was a lady , and a perfect one ; but Lanny did n't want to escort her into the suite alone , nor did he wish her to witness the interview between himself and his wife . He parked near the hotel and left her as before . Irma still had n't arrived , though it was after midnight ; he assumed that she was enjoying a good gossip with the Frau Ritter von Fiebewitz , and he used the time to make a thorough search of her bedroom , under the rugs , inside the window curtains , under the bed , to make sure there was nothing resembling a wire or metal disk which might be part of a sound-transmitting device . He took the additional precaution to get a heavy bath towel and wrap the telephone in it . After that he was ready for the " big scene . " Irma had been having a good time , including , no doubt , a couple of cocktails ; her cheeks were flushed and she was full of things to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be late , but I had such a curious adventure ! Did you ever see a Thingspiel ? " " I have heard of them , " he said . " Fiebewitz 's cousin came and took us out into the country somewhere , and we saw one , in a big open-air theater . There must have been a thousand people , peasants and villagers , and really I felt I was in Germany for the first time in my life . The play was unbelievably crude , but they ate it up  --  the women were sobbing all around me . It made me think of an Uncle Tom 's Cabin show I saw once when I was a girl  --  up in the Adirondacks . Fiebewitz says it is like the old miracle and mystery plays in England . " " What was it about ? " Lanny had to be polite now , of all times . " About Hitler and his saving the German people . It was called German Passion 1933 , and it showed how Hitler took up the cross  --  really it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ being crucified by the Jews , and then he had a resurrection and ascended to heaven , and got instructions from an angel , and came back to earth in shining armor to save a lovely blue-eyed maiden with two long braids of flaxen hair ; she was Germany , of course , and it sounds silly to tell it , but you ca n't imagine how deeply moved the audience was . I 'm sure those country women all really believed the Fuhrer had had exactly those experiences . " " Listen , dear , " said Lanny , quickly . " You 'd better come in here if you want to talk about things like that . " He drew her into the bedroom and shut the door , led her to a chair , drew up his own , and said : " Something serious has happened . Listen carefully , and please , whatever you think , do n't raise your voice . " So began the story of how Lanny had received a note from a young woman artist of talent , telling of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet her ; what she had told him about her activities and the fate of her associates , and how he had driven her past her tenement home and what they had seen . It was the truth and nothing but the truth , but of course not the whole truth . He found that Irma did n't remember Trudi ; the woman artist had been one of some twoscore persons she had met at a reception of the school , and had disapproved of . It was a perfectly consistent story , and while telling it he thought that he was getting away with it . But when he quit , he soon discovered that he was n't ! His young wife sat with her hands clenched tightly and her lips pressed to/gether . " You see ! " she exclaimed . " I ca n't trust you ! You have got mixed up with that Red business again ! " " No , dear --  " " Do n't try to fool me any longer , Lanny ! You have been meeting that woman ! Tell me the truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have met her two or three times , and gave her some money  --  I could n't very well refuse to help her , when I consider her a real artist --  " " Artist my eye ! You helped her because she 's a Socialist , and you ca n't refuse anything those people ask of you . You 've been coming into Germany on her account , and not for pictures . And now you 've got yourself into another mess , the very thing you swore to me you would n't . You got me into Germany on that promise , and you were breaking it and meant to go on breaking it . What is that woman to you that you have to wreck our happiness for her sake ? " " Darling , " he said , " let me make one thing clear at the start  --  there has n't been the faintest hint of love between Trudi Schultz and me . I have n't so much as touched her hand . She is all wrapped up in the fate of her husband . She clings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration camp , and that she is helping him by the work she is doing . Please be sure of that , Irma . " There were tears in her eyes . " How little you understand me , Lanny ! If you came to me and said you loved this woman , I 'd be heart-broken , of course , but I would n't stand in the way of your happiness . If you told me that you had been making love to her , and that you realized it was a mistake and that you really loved me , I 'd forgive you and try again to make you happy . That would be something I could understand , and if you said you were sorry I could believe you . But this Socialism business is something you are n't sorry about ; you consider that it 's right , and you mean to go on with it ! " She paused ; and when he was silent , she insisted : " Is n't that true ? " " Yes , " he admitted , in a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised by her point of view ; impressed by its logic and at the same time shocked by the fierceness of prejudice it revealed.  | " That 's why I know I can never be happy with you again ! " exclaimedthe outraged wife . " Listen , dear , " he pleaded ; " there is so much to be said on this subject --  " " No , Lanny , you are mistaken . It can all be said in a very few words . " " Do n't say them now  --  please ! Try to understand the situation . Trudi has no place in the world to go . The Nazis have seized the working people she was staying with  --  an elderly printer , a frail mother , and two half-grown children . The chances are a hundred to one that they have them in their dungeons at this moment and are torturing them to make them tell where Trudi is . " " Do they know where she is ? " " They do not . " " But you know ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and she ca n't sit there much longer without attracting attention . The entire police force of Berlin , the Brownshirts , the Schutzstaffel  --  the whole Nazi machine  --  have her picture and will be on the look-out for her . " " What is it you want me to do ? " " I want you to help her get out of Germany . " " Just a little simple thing like that ! " " You must remember , dear , this is n't a new problem to me . I faced it when I thought of getting Freddi out . I worked out many differentplans . " " None of which was good enough ! " " I did n't have your help then . " " Suppose I refuse to help ? " " I 'll have to do the best I can by myself . I 'm surely not going to turn this woman out of our car and leave her on the streets to be picked up by those savages . " " And suppose I want the car to go home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of buying another . Somehow I have to get her to the border . There are people who make money smuggling refugees out , and perhaps I can find them . " There was a long silence . He understood that a struggle was goingp239on in her soul , and thought that she had better settle it for herself . Finally she said : " You have done something quite horrible to me , and something I can never forgive . But I do n't want to see you killed , and I 'm put in the position where I have to help this woman or run the risk of causing your death . If you can show me any chance of getting her out , I will do my part ; but do n't for a moment take it to mean that I am condoning what you have done . " " I am on my knees with gratitude , darling , and I will do all that a man can do to make it up to you . " " There is no way you can ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself with the idea . I have deceived myself long enough , and this time it 's never again . I want to have it understood  --  I 'm going to help , and publicly I 'll do and say whatever is necessary ; but apart from that I do n't want to hear one word from her , and as few from you as possible . I do n't mean to he disagreeable  --  I just want to avoid arguments , and to keep my thoughts to myself , and solve my own problems while you solve hers . " He thought it the part of wisdom to let matters rest right there . SERENE and self-possessed , according to the code of the aloof classes , Irma Barnes and her prince consort strolled through the lobby of the Hotel Adlon and out to their parked car . Within sight of the august doorman the wife was introduced to her husband 's friend and shook hands with her , and then the three strolled back into the hotel , Lanny giving the car keys to the functionary so that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guests went up in the elevator to their suite , and when they were in Irma 's bedroom , with the muffled telephone receiver , she delivered herself as follows : " Miss Schultz , my husband has explained to me the unfortunate circumstances , and I have agreed to try to help you . We have decided to postpone conversation on all other subjects until that has been done . You will understand that I am doing it for my husband 's sake , and not for that of a stranger ; so do not waste any words in thanking me , but let us get down at once to the practical questions of how to proceed . " Trudi gulped once , and replied : " Frau Budd , your husband has not told me his plans , so all I can say is that I am prepared to do whatever you and he tell me . I am deeply sorry to have put you in this position . " " We can not go backward , so there is no use discussing that . " Irma turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remembered the large and determined mother in Shore Acres who had tried so hard to prevent this unfortunate marriage ; also the buccaneer of Wall Street whose black-mustached and frowning portrait confrontedthe household at the head of the grand staircase and still had power to intimidate . On Lanny 's recent visit , rummaging in unexploreddrawers of his deceased father-in-law 's library , he had come upon a stack of handsomely printed pamphlets containing a speech which the manufacturer of public-utility pyramids had delivered to the United States Chamber of Commerce in banquet assembled . In it the man of great affairs had stated his opinion of " Socialist crackpotsand dreamers "  --  thus putting a prince consort in his place , just as Irma was now doing ! " We can not leave tonight , " declared the husband , in a low voice , " because we have no exit permits ; also it would seem phony if we left Germany without putting through the picture deal for which we came . The first thing in the morning I will phone Oberleutnant Furtwaengler and explain that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he will recognize the urgency , and will nop241doubt bring the paintings and the necessary papers at once . If we have our bill of sale with the signature of General Goring 's office , it may solve problems at the border  --  I proved that the last time I went out . " " You mean that you expect to get through without either a passportor exit permit for Miss Schultz ? " " This is what I have in mind . We leave Celeste here at the hotel , stating that we are going to visit the Fuhrer and then return . ' We take Trudi out with Celeste 's exit permit , and we take her into Austria on Celeste 's passport . " " But there is Celeste 's picture on the passport , and Miss Schultz does not look in the least like a Breton peasant . " " It will be late at night , and Miss Schultz will be lying back in the rear seat , pretty well surrounded by paintings and bags . If any question is raised , I will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . I will also say that I am a friend of the MinisterPrasidentGeneral , and am handling these paintings for him ; also that we have just come from a visit to the Fairer , and that they may call the Berghof , which is only a couple of miles inside the border . I am sure those statements will turn the officials to jelly . " " And then what do you expect to do about Celeste ? Leave her in Germany the rest of her life ? " Lanny had worked over a problem like that more than two years ago , when he had been scheming to carry Freddi Robin out of Germanyon the passport of a truck driver . He had told that story to Irma , but he did n't remind her of it now . He explained : " Celeste will be staying safely in this hotel , going to picture shows and flirting with one of the male employees . She gets a letter from you saying that you were called home unexpectedly and that you forgot her papers and carried them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . You enclose money and tell her to join you in London or wherever you wish . Celeste waits , but the papers do not come , and when she telegraphs you to that effect you reply that they must have got lost in the mail . You tell her to go to the French consul and have the matter straightened out ; you telegraph the French consul explaining the error and he will give her a new pass- port . All this may mean that you will have to have a substitute maid for a month or so . " " You overlook one detail : there will be a record at the border where we go out , showing that Celeste 's passport and exit permit were used there and that three persons went out . " " In the first place , in wiring Celeste and the French consul you will not say when or where you went out , but will state that we left Berlin hurriedly because we had an invitation to visit the Fiihrer , and you afterward decided to come home at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he presents the new passportand gets the new exit permit . The authorities will hardly do much investigating in a case of the Fuhrer 's guests ; at the worst it could not be a serious matter for Celeste , for it will be obvious that she is an ignorant person , a victim of her employers , and that she has no idea what has been done to her . Most probably she will never know just what happened to her ; if she does , a small sum of money will salve her feelings . If possible , think up some errand for her to do tomorrow morning , so that she will not see Trudi and will have no idea that we have anyone with us . " Said Irma : " This may mean that you will never be able to come back into Germany . " " We can see how that works out , " was the reply . " It is my guess that I can come into Germany any time I have a bank draft for a large sum payable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom to his guest , and slept on a couch in the drawing-room  --  since Irma did not invite him into her room . Lanny slept , because he knew he had to drive hard on the morrow , and he had grown to some extent accustomed to mixups with the Gestapo . Whether either of the ladies slept they did not tell him and he did not ask . In the morning his first act was to call the worshipful Oberleutnant , who , being a member of the fat General 's household , was available early . As Lanny had foreseen , the young officer was overwhelmed by the news about the invitation to thep243Berghof , and undertook to get the paintings and the necessary papers and bring them personally to the Adlon . Lanny removed all traces of his having slept in the drawing-room , and locked Trudi in the bedroom while breakfast was set on a couple of folding-tables ; also while Irma summoned Celeste , who slept in the servants ' quarters of the hotel . She came , a sturdy peasant woman , always smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick being planned . She looked embarrassingly unlike Trudi Schultz ; it was evident that no amount of illness or starvation would ever reduce those broad cheekbones , or cause those features to assume the delicacy and fineness of a woman saint 's . But Lanny was planning to blind the eyes of border officials , and he was interested to observe how even a Frenchwoman was thrilled by the news of the visit to the Fiihrer . The mistress explained that they were taking only two bags and had already put their things into these . She mentioned that her mother 's birthday was approaching , and she had meant to send a gift ; now she commissioned Celeste to visit the department stores and select something that was completely German and that Mrs. Barnes would appreciate , and send it by mail or express . Irma gave her a hundred-mark note , worth about forty dollars at this time , and sent her off contented and with no suspicion of anything wrong in the Budd family . Lanny ordered his car and hurried to the Austrian consulate , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the passports of himself , wife , and maid . When he got back to the hotel , the efficient Oberleutnant was on hand , and in one of the parlors of the hotel Lanny examined the two paintings , paid the money , and took the bill of sale with the magical stamp of the fat General 's office ; also the exit permits . He exchanged the usual courtesieswith his S.S. friend , and forbore to ask whether he had recently been down in any cellars , whipping the editors and printers of a Socialist paper . The paintings were carried to the car and placed in the back seat  --  fortunately they were not very large . Lanny bade the doorman keep his eye on them , and returned to the hotel and phoned Irma that all was ready . He paid the bill , incidentally mentioning to the clerk that he was driving to Berchtesgaden to pay a call upon the Fuhrer that evening . In the midst of the interest aroused by this conversation , Irma and a well-dressed woman friend emerged from the elevator and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a couple of bags . Lanny performed his customary function of distributorof tips ; and if it should happen that any of the day staff would compare notes with any of the night staff and realize that a strange lady had passed the night in the Budd suite , Lanny felt sure they would not bother to report it to the Polizei . The strangest ride this habitual motorist had yet taken over the old continent of Europe ! Irma had not a word to say , and Trudi respected her wishes ; so Lanny conducted himself as a well-trained chauffeur . He had something more than four hundred miles to cover and no time to waste ; he kept his eyes fixed on the excellent Reichsautobahnbefore him and his right foot on the accelerator . If any traffic officer on the route Berlin  --  Leipzig  --  Regensburg  --  Munich ventured to stop him , he had the most perfect of answers ; if the authoritypresumed to doubt his word , he had the document from the office of the second-in-command . Seeing this , any traffic officer would volunteer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road over which Lanny and his wife had traveled more than once . The level plains of Prussia , now green with potatoes and sugar-beets  --  unless they had been taken over by higher authority and were dusty with the tramp of drilling recruits or with great tanks thundering like herds of stampeding elephants . Lanny thought he had seen military preparations before , but never anything like this . There was hardly a large field without a group of youths wearingsandals and khaki shorts and shirts open at the throat , launching one of their number into the air on a glider . Great planes curved and swooped overhead , and time and again the travelers heard sounds of gunfire . Tourists were free to come into the Fatherland and witnessthese spectacles , and so for that matter were the agents ofp245Britain , France , and other nations which had signed the Versailles treaty ; but apparently no statesman of any nation could think of anything to do but make fussy speeches about it . The hotel had put a lunch into the car , and after they were past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and pass it about . He munched a sandwich while he drove ; then , since dead silence seemed hardly polite at mealtimes , he bethought him of a new gadget which Irma had had installed in the car  --  a radio set with which to beguile the tedium of motoring . He ventured to turn it on , softly and diffidently . She made no comment , and so , reaching in front of her knees , he turned the dial : a Nazi orator bellowing ; a Nazi newsman denouncing a recent British statement on the subject of German affairs , then , magically , a lovely melody floating out upon the air , an orchestra playing the first movement of the Pastoral Symphony . " Allegro ma non molto . The pleasant feelingsaroused in the heart on arriving in the country "  --  so Beethoven had written upon the score . It had been the gracious countryside about Vienna which the master had had in mind , and there had been fewer soldiers tramping and not a single armored tank rumbling , not a single fighter plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever in the range of musical history there has been produced a more sustained expression of " pleasant feelings . " Lanny had hopes of the effect these sounds might have upon the abnormally silent woman by his side . If music be the food of love , play on ! Perhaps it was a live orchestra , perhaps a " canned " one ; anyhow , it played , and presently : " Andante con moto . Scene at the Brook . " Call it that if it pleased your fancy , but to Lanny it was one of those glider-planes floating over hill and dale ; the youth in it thinking not about dropping a bomb upon some of his fellowhumans , but about the mastery of nature , the widening of vision and enhancement of the joy of living . Something like this magical car , which enabled one to speed from one landscape to the next , lending to space an element of time , making geography into history and scenery into panorama . " Scherzo . Jovial assembly of country folk . " Lanny knew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peasants of Provence ,  | and had learned to dance the farandole as a boy . So many innocent pleasures life offered , if only men could be persuaded not to rob and kill ! If only they would let Beethoven teach them how to make more joy for themselves , instead of stealing the joy of others ! Here the country folk were interrupted by nothing more dangerous than a thunderstorm ; and Lanny , who as a rule did not care for program music , found these musical sheets of rain so vivid that he had an impulse to start his windshield wiper . He did not at any time take his eyes off the road ahead , so he could n't guess whether his moods were being shared by the woman at his side . " Allegro . Pleasurable feelings after the storm , mixed with gratitude to God . " Surely no woman could go on quarreling in her mind while that most heavenly melody laid siege to her ears ! Surely she , too , must have gratitude  --  merely to be alive in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must cry out : " Oh , Lanny , let us be kind to each other ! Let us be happy , and not miss any more of the holy rapture of being ! " But if she had such thoughts she crushed them down , and kept that implacable silence , broken only by practical remarks , as when she pointed out that the gas-gauge was low or offered to take his place at the wheel . The forests of Thuringia , and then the pleasant valley of the River Naab , tributary to the Danube . The last time Lanny had been driven over this route was at night ; the S.S. had been taking him to Berlin , for reasons about which they had left him to guess . He much preferredit to be daytime , even if the view was the rather unlovely Oberpfalz , sometimes referred to as the Bavarian Siberia . They came into the city of Munich a little before seven , still having a hundred miles to go and no time to waste . Lanny insisted that he was n't tired ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes for Freddi Robin . A gentle climb into the foothills of the Bavarian Alps ; the road became more winding , and there were streams , and here and there little lakes which make the district popular with tourists and vaca/tioners . The sun was down behind the mountains , and twilight was gathering . The campers were at supper , or singing their Nazi songs ; the young people all wore military insignia now , and all hikes were drills , practice in hiding from enemies or creeping up on them . Lanny knew that he and Irma saw these things through different eyes ; to her it was " Strength through Joy , " while to him it was demoralizationand cruelty , the breaking to pieces of the Germany he knew and loved in music , literature , and philosophy . At last the village of Berchtesgaden , named for a witch , Berchta , with whom Bavarian children are frightened into behaving themselves . To Lanny it seemed appropriate that Adi Schicklgruber should have chosen this place for his hideout while plotting the bewitchmentof Europe . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far ahead and high up was a revolving light , like that of a lighthouse , and Lanny knew this to be his destination . " Here 's where we have our trouble , if any , " he said ; and sure enough , at the entrance of the Fuhrer 's road there was a barrier painted with blue and white stripes , and a guard-building with several armed sentries in the black and silver S.S. uniform . Lanny stopped within a few feet of the obstacle , and when the captain of the guard emerged and flashed an electric torch upon him he extended his arm . " Heil Hitler ! " All the Nazis as one returned the salute . " Heil Hitler ! Heil Hitler ! " " I have an appointment with the Fuhrer , " said Lanny . " Ihr Name , mein Herr ? " " Lanny Budd . " " Und die Dame ? " " Meine Frau . " The man flashed the torch upon Irma and then into the back of the car , full into Trudi 's face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone indicating surprise . " My wife 's maid . " " Aber , Herr Budd , we have no instructions concerning a third person . " " One does not make appointments for servants , surely ! " " Aber , mein Herr , it must be specified . It is strictly forbidden strengstens verboten  --  that anyone shall enter unless we have been notified . " " What do you expect me to do ? " " The maid will please to wait here until after your visit . " " Aber , " said Lanny , " we are going out by way of Salzburg . Surely it is not to be expected that we shall drive all the way back here for a maid ? " " Leider , mein Herr . " Lanny had learned that with subordinates in the Fatherland you take a high tone ; they expect it and also respect it . " That is ridiculous , " he said ; " it is contrary to good sense . " " Leider , Herr Budd . Es ist der Be f ehl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is off . Wir gehen nicht hinein . What road do we take to Salzburg ? " Horror revealed itself on the countenance of the officer and of the bystanding S.S. men . To have an appointment with the Fuhrer and refuse to keep it on account of anything on earth ! Undenkbar ! Echt Amerikanisch ! Lanny started to back the car and to turn . " Bitte , Herr Budd , einen Augenblick ! " exclaimed the officer . " I will telephone . " A man might be demoted  --  a man might be decapitated  --  for permitting such a calamityas this ! " Speak to the Fuhrer 's secretary , " commanded the haughty one . " Tell him to tell the Fuhrer that Frau Budd has her maid with her , and wishes to go out by way of Salzburg after the visit , and naturally does not wish to drive eight miles back and then make a detour to get to the border . " " Zu Be f ehl , Herr Budd ! " The officer hastened into the guard-house , and Lanny waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of that torch in her face . He did n't turn round to see . The officer came out again . " Ihnen ist 's gestattet , " he said , with relief in his voice . " It must be understood that the maid shall remain in the car during the visit . " " Of course , " was the reply . " Why should she wish to get out ? " The barrier was raised and the car sped on.  |p249The  road wound along the side of the Obersalzberg ; it had been cut out of solid rock and was quite an engineering job . Lanny drove fast but with vigilance , sounding his horn on all the blind turns . The streaming lights of his car moved swiftly over the sides of the mountain , clothed with pine trees and cut with small streams , each of which had been bridged . There was no better engineer in the world than that General Todt whom the Fiihrer had set to constructinghis military highways . Lanny knew the story of this mountain chalet which had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been called Haus Wachenfels , or Watch Rock , and had belonged to a Munich merchant . Hitler had rented it immediately after his release from the brief and amiable term of imprisonment he had served after the Beerhall Putsch . Here he had written , or had had Rudolf Hess write for him , the second part of Mein Kampf , and later he had purchased the place and changed its name to Der Berghof  --  Berg meaning mountain and Hof meaning yard , farm , manor , mansion , court , or hotel , whichever you chose ! The Fiirstin Donnerstein had reported that a lot of improvements were being made . Adi Schicklgruber , down-and-out painter of picture postcards , had yearned all his youth to be an architect , and now he had Germany for a buildingsite and the budget of the Third Reich for expenses . He was remaking Munich and planning to remake Berlin , and here in these remote mountains he was listening to the music of the Waldweben and the Feuerzauber , and building a hideout for himself and the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier and anotherguard-building with S.S. men . Lanny stopped , they saluted , and he returned the salute and gave his name . They asked : " Who is with you ? " and he replied : " My wife and my wife 's maid . " They peered in with torches and then told him to proceed . Lanny had always made it a matter of prestige to arrive on time for an appointment ; in spite of delays it lacked three minutes of twenty-two o'clock when his car came in sight of the chalet . The drive widened , and there was plenty of space , so he parked discreetlya short distance away . Trudi was resting in the back seat , and he had told her to keep her eyes closed , sleep if she could and in any case pretend to . Strange things must have been going on in the soul of a Social-Democratic outlaw , transported to the very door of the man whom she considered as Satan incarnate . But this was no time to ask her thoughts . There was a sentry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in front of the house a machine gun on a tripod , with two S.S. men sitting beside it . The house was of whitewashed stucco , and in the dim twilight , reinforced by the moon , Lanny could see signs of new construction but could not make out the details . When he and Irma neared the building one of the guards switched on a floodlight which shone blindingly in their faces ; apparently the inspectionwas satisfactory , for the light disappeared as suddenly as it had come , and before they had a chance to knock or to ring a bell the door was opened by a man in livery . The inside of the chalet was modest . The woodwork was stained dark brown , and the furniture was of the modern , tubular metal sort . There was a spacious drawing-room , with wide windows looking over the mountains , significantly toward Austria , only two miles away . There was a grand piano in the room , and a radio cabinet , and in the center a sort of council table with a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany were debated and decided ; Lanny knew that if Adi could have his way , it would some day be true for the destinies of Europe . The master of the chalet came forward , wearing the smile which made him attractive in his good moods . He had grown rather stouter , Lanny thought ; presumably he was getting plenty of those vegetableplates with butter and a poached egg on top . But his cheeks still had their pasty color , and the little dark mustache seemed stuck on , like that of the comedian who had set the fashion . " Willkommen , Herr Budd ! " he said , greeting the man first , according to the continentalcustom . Then he welcomed the wife and held her hand a few seconds too long  --  he was fond of ladies ' hands , it was rumored . " I was wondering if you had allowed yourself time enough , " hep251added ; when Lanny told him the hour at which they had left Berlin , he exclaimed : " Ach , Ihr Anzerikaner ! I should put you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you would keep me in a place like this , I would n't mind . " That pleased the host , and without heeding the other persons in the room he led his guests to the front window and let them see the moonlight on the mountains and valleys . " I am going to build something wonderful here ! " he declared . " I mean to have the biggest window in all the world , and in a second story , so that you can see everything . The statesmen will come from all over to admire this view . " " My guess is the statesmen will be coming for something else , " remarked Lanny , and this brought a chuckle . Having read the Fuhrer 's book , and many of his speeches over a period of years , Lanny knew his mind and could play upon it , just as he could have played upon the piano which stood invitingly open . Present in the room were a general , two colonels , and a major ; Lanny assumed that a military conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were permanent members of the household . Also two professors , though he did not learn what they professed ; he was sure it included the doctrines of National Socialism and the glory of a one-time " Bohemian corporal . " In addition there was a dour grim fellow only slightly older than Lanny , with bushy black hair and eyebrows , a square stern jaw and silent manner . Having heard him speak at a Versarrnlung , Lanny knew him for Reichsminister Hess , the Fiihrer 's deputy in charge of party affairs and one of two or three Nazis who addressed the great man as " du . " Had this company assembled out of curiosity concerning a New York " glamour girl " ? It seemed most unlikely . Their Fiihrer in introducingthem did not refer to Irma 's wealth , but said : " Herr Budd is a boyhood friend of our Kurt Meissner , and Kurt tells me that if it had not been for the Budd family , his musical career might not have been possible . "  | " Kurt is too generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genius does not give up so easily . Our family was many times repaid by what he taught us , not merely of German music , but of German Charakterstiirke and Seelengrosse . " The visitor meant to continue along this line , but was interrupted by the entrance of a woman known to both him and Irma ; the Frau Reichsminister Goebbels , wearing a low-cut gown of pale-blue Chinesesilk crepe , seeming to accentuate the paleness of her delicate features , also the fact that she had lost weight in the two years since they had met her . Lanny and Irma waited for her to recognize them , and she apparently waited upon the Fuhrer . " Magda tells me you are old acquaintances , " he said ; and Lanny answered , quickly : " The Frau Reichsminister was kind enough to take an interest in our exhibitionof Detaze paintings . " He did n't want her to mention that he had asked her help in rescuing a Jewish family from prison , for he knew that if that topic was broached their host might spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magda greeted them cordially , and then seated herself and listened in silence . The Fuhrer had noted the name of Detaze , and remarked : " I remember the portrait you brought me at the Braune Haus ; a notable piece of work . " " Your critics both in Munich and Berlin were kind to the exhibition , " replied Lanny . " Marcel Detaze is the sort of painter to whom you have given approval . " " I would be glad to have a specimen of his work here in this house when I have completed the rebuilding . I understand that his work is mostly landscapes , nicht water ? " " Land and sea , Exzellenz . " " Well , suppose the next time you come you bring me what you consider a representative work , and charge me what you consider a fair price . " " I would be embarrassed to charge you for it , Herr Reichskanzler . " " Nanu , what talk is that ? If the works are for sale , why not to me ? I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it will notmerely promote the reputation of a worthy artist , but will be a stepp253toward the reconciliation of Germany and France , which is one of my cherished dreams . " " If you put it that way , I can not resist . " The word Fuhrer means leader , and means that , among other things , he is privileged to lead a conversation ; so Lanny waited . " You still make your home in France , Herr Budd ? " " Most of the time . " " Perhaps you can help me by telling me about the French people : what is it they desire of me , and how can I persuade them of my good intentions toward them ? " " That is not an easy undertaking , Exzellenz . The French are less homogeneous than the Germans  --  especially as you have made them . You have to think of the French as several different factions , very much at odds with one another . " " And yet , they would all unite against my Regierung , would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will not have to . The French desire peace above everything else . " " Then why can I not persuade them to come to reasonable arrangements with me , who also desire peace first of all ? You may have read my speech of last May to my Reichstag --  " " I studied it carefully , and so did all my friends in France and England . " " In that I made a special effort to explain myself to both countries , point by point . Yet it would appear that I have not had much success . Can you tell me any reasons ? " " Do you wish me to answer frankly , Herr Reichskanzler ? " " Vallshindig off en ! " " Also ! It happens unfortunately that you have written in Mein K npf that the annihilation of France is one of Germany 's aims . " " Ach , der Unsinn ! We are not talking about literature , but about politics . " " The French note that the book is still being sold , and that you have never repudiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written while I was in prison , and very bitter in soul . If I had the time , I would rewrite it ; but now I am in the midst of events  --  I am not longer ein verhungerter Schriftsteller , but a man of affairs , and I reveal my ideas in action . If I make a just and enduring treaty with the French , is not that what really counts ? " Lanny could have made reply to this statement : " Herr Reichskanzler , I am embarrassed to know your literary work better than yourself . It happens that the statement about the Vernichtung of France appears in the second part of Mein Karnpf , which was written , not in prison , but in this very chalet where we now sit , and after you had had a year to recuperate from your eight months ' incarceration  --  forwhich , in any case , the Germans and not the French were responsible . " But where in the world was the head of a government to whom one could speak like that ? Lanny well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they served his purpose . You might as well try to put a large and lively eel into your coat pocket as to hold him to any reality which did n't happen to fit in with his purposes and desires . Lanny did n't have to make any further comments , and neither did anyone else ; for the Fiihrer had got started at his fiihring . He did n't want to learn anything , he wanted to tell things ; and Lanny knew from experience both public and private that once he had got started nothing could stop him , and that an audience of two was as good as one of two thousand in the Biirgerbraukeller of Munich , or twenty thousand in the Sportpalast of Berlin , or a million on the Zeppelin field during the Partyday at Nurnberg  --  due now in a couple of weeks . Lanny had heard Adi speak for two hours and a half , and he knew there were speeches of five hours on the record . Here was an audience of eleven : four military men , two professors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Popular Enlightenmentand Propaganda ; a Franco-American Kunstsachverstiindiger ; an heiress member of international cafe society ; and last but not least , the Reichskanzler and Fuhrer of the Third German Reich . He was the one who most enjoyed the oratory and was most deeplyp255moved by it ; the longer he spoke , the greater became his earnestness and fervor , the harder he struck with his fists , the louder he raised his voice , and the more alarming became his aspect . He informed this small select company what would be the verdict of posterity : that in concluding a compact with Bolshevik Russia , the statesmen of France had committed one of the major crimes as well as one of the major blunders of history . He said that this alliance with bloody-handed class war could have only one effect and one meaning , as all the world must know ; it was directed against Germany , and was an alliance for aggression , since National Socialist Germany had no power to attack France and no idea of doing so . National Socialist Germany desired only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unemployment , as its Fiihrer had pledged himself to his people to do ; but here was a barbariandespotism on the Fatherland 's eastern border , ruthless and cruel Asiatic hordes actuated by diabolical Jewish-Marxist theories -- So it went . When Adi added the prefix Juden to any good thing it immediately became bad , and when he added the prefix to something bad it became a thousand times worse . Look at the spectacle they were now offering in Moscow ! Could any man in his senses doubt that the Juden Roten planned to conquer not merely Germany , but the whole civilized world ? They gathered their agents from the four quarters of the globe and set them up on a public platform to boast of the crimes they meant to commit . They were using all the border states of Germany as centers of intrigue and secret warfare against the National Socialist Reich ; they printed literatureadvocating sabotage and terrorism , and smuggled it wholesale into Germany ; they had hundreds of agents , both native and foreign , working inside the Fatherland to undermine and destroy it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in our country against the conspiracies and intrigues of these diabolical foes ! " shouted the Fiihrer , and Lanny felt shivers running up and down his spine , thinkinghow at any moment one of the S.S. men might appear in the doorway and announce : " Mein Fuhrer , we have discovered a **27;8638;TOOLONG conspirator hiding in the car of your American guests ! "  | " We are the implacable opponents of this cannibal band , " proclaimedthe master of all Germany . " And we call upon decent people of all lands to help us hold them down . We and we alone have the means  --  I do not mean the material weapons , for in that we have been rendered helpless by the wicked Versailles Diktat . The JudenBolschewistenhave fleets of tanks enormously outweighing ours , and they have the greatest armada of planes in the world , ready to pounce upon our cities and destroy them without warning . Against all that , we Germans have the pattern of the new society , and we have the courage and the faith in our own destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans were overcome by arms in the last war  --  our defeat was due solely to the fact that our moral forces failed us , we fell victims to the stab in the back from these Jewish-Bolshevik vipers we had nourished in our midst . " It took Adi a full hour to run through the gamut of his ideas . He exposed the treachery of France and Britain in failing to disarm  --  in accordance with the legend which he himself had originated , that they had promised at Versailles to do this . He repeated his assertion that National Socialist Germany was the one truly democratic land , and that he was a deputy elected by thirty-eight million votes . He repudiated every war to subjugate alien peoples , declaring that Germanywanted only Germans , and for this reason her defense forces were the world 's best guarantee of peace . " Friede and Freiheit fur alle , das ist National Sozialismnus ! " proclaimed the world 's champion endurance orator . Lanny Budd , who had learned all this by heart many years ago , permitted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The military men sat rigidly at attention , that being the discipline they had learned . The professors , now turned pupils , displayed that respect in which German pupils are never known to fail . Black-browed Rudolf Hess , most devoted of disciples , sat like a statue of adoration , his lips slightly parted , as if he were drinking in wisdom by mouth as well as by ear . But most interesting to Lanny was the face of Magda Goebbels ; her rather sweet features had worn a melancholy expressionp257two years ago , and now he thought : " Here is the saddest of women ! " He knew that her crooked little husband had all the beautiful young actresses of the Third Reich at his command , and the uses he was making of them might well cause his wife to wear an expression of martyrdom . Lanny wondered , what was she doing here ? He knew that before her marriage she had been a devoted party worker and contributor to the campaign chest . Had she now taken up some duties which brought her here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this haunt of more than dubious men ? No information was offered and of course neither Lanny nor his wife would ask . Did the Fuhrer happen to observe his auditor 's eyes wandering ? Or had he learned by painful experience that even the most reverent audience can stand only so much ? He turned suddenly toward the Americans and said : " It is a shame to weary one 's guests with politicalspeech-making . " Lanny was about to utter some polite nothing , when , to her husband'ssurprise , Irma took the cue . " Not at all , Herr Hitler ! ' What you have said has interested me greatly . I have heard so many charges made against you and your ideas , and now I have had a chance to hear your answers . I want you to know that I agree with every word you have said . " The Fuhrer of the Germans beamed with pleasure . " I am truly pleased to hear you say that , Frau Budd . A person of your influence might do a great deal to correct misunderstandings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no influence that I know of ; but you may be sure that whenever I have a chance I will tell people what you have told me . " A most gratifying outcome of a propaganda effort ! Only one thing more was needed , and that was for the husband to speak . " And you , Herr Budd ? " inquired the orator . Lanny got himself together quickly and forced a laugh . " I am a devoted husband , " he declared , " and you must know that I would n't permit myself to disagree in public with anything my wife says . " It was enough to get by with ; the great man smiled , and his court circle followed suit . Having been good pupils , they were now entitled to a reward . The master of the household clapped his hands , one of the military gentlemen pressed a button in the wall , and there came running into the room the most perfectly round human creature that Lanny had ever beheld ; body like a hogshead and face like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Herr Kannenberg , " said Hitler , introducing him with a sweep of the arm . Lanny had heard of him ; a Restaurateur of Berlin who had become a court favorite and been placed in charge of the Fiihrer 's households  --  the Berghof , the Munich apartment , and the Chancellery in Berlin . He managed the servants , saw to the preparation of the vegetable plates and the non-alcoholic beer , and whenever Putzi Hanfstaengl was n't on hand he played the clown . " Musik ! " commanded the master , and the rolypoly picked up a highly ornamented accordion and seated himself on the piano stool , presenting a truly comical figure , for his flesh was draped over all sides of the frail support and his legs could n't quite reach the floor . He began to play and sing : " Tiroler sind lustig , so lustig and froh ! " He had n't much of a voice , but was jolly , and had made his place in life that way . While he sang , two servingmen brought refreshments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saint among his followers because of his habits in eating and drinking . " Flab ' oft die gauze Nacht an ihrer Hiitten g'wacht , " sang the minstrel ; and then it was : " Z ' Lauterbach hab ' i ' mein ' Strumpf verlor'n . " He yodeled mournfully about this tragedy of the lost stocking ; and Lanny wondered what Trudi Schultz would be making of the sounds . The day had been warm , and the windows of the drawingroomwere open to the cool night breezes laden with the scent of pine and fir . She would hardly be asleep in such a crisis , and the revelry would n't seem to her to have any saintly quality ; rather it would be that of ghouls dancing over the suffering bodies of her comrades . True Socialism had been murdered , and this base counterfeitwas dancing on its grave !  |p259The  fun grew faster , and the fat clown 's face lighted up with glee , as he began one of those chants in which all over the world country folk mock at the smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er , muss du fein , sagt er , and gescheit , sagt er , immer sein , sagt er , denn da haben 's , sagt er , vied Verstand , sagt er , ich bin dort , sagt er , vied bekannt ! " While pretending to listen , Lanny thought about the words which had come from his wife 's lips . Did she really mean them , or was it simply part of the quarrel with her husband and with the strange woman who disputed the possession of her husband 's mind ? To Lanny the words had been like a blow in the face , revealing to him what Irma had been thinking during the past night and day and what he might expect when they were again by themselves . The Pastoral Symphony had been altogether without charm to soothe the savage breast . There came a pause in the revelry , and Hitler said : " A friend of Kurt Meissner should be a musician , Herr Budd . " " On a very modest scale , Exzellenz ; but Kurt and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would you like me to play for you ? " " Bitte sehr , " said the Fuhrer ; and Lanny seated himself at the very fine piano . He was n't going to enter into rivalry with any court favorite ; he did n't feel gay at that moment , but on the contrary grief-stricken at the spectacle of the world 's woe . He had just seen Loki , god of lies , performing his tricks and winning his triumph ; and since Lanny could n't say in words what he thought and felt about it he would let Beethoven speak . Beethoven was Lanny 's friend and refuge in all conflicts with the Nazi Loki ; and now Lanny struck the opening chords of the sonata which has been ineptlycalled Moonlight , but which is an utterance of the most profoundand poignant grief . " Come and listen , 0 mighty Fuhrer , and learn what the great soul of Germany thinks of you and your glory ! Come and weep for the ten million little monsters whom you are rearing up to torment and poison all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ! Beethoven was dead , and this usurper would take his music and turn it to his own ends . Adi Schicklgruber would be hearing these mournful notes as a lament for his dead Nazi heroes , a tribute to his " blood-flags " and his whole ritual of Moloch ! Woe , woe , unending woe , and blood all over the weeping world ! One movement was enough . " Ausgezeichnet ! " exclaimed the Fuhrer . " I see that you not merely know how to play , but what to play . " " I will be happy to come and help celebrate your house-warming , " replied the guest . He was n't sure whether this household was conductedaccording to the protocol of royalty and whether he should wait to be dismissed . He guessed it could n't do much harm if he offered to take himself away before he had worn out his welcome , so he said : " I am afraid we have had more than our share of your time , Herr Reichskanzler . " " We have enjoyed your visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will both come again . " It was a dismissal , and the visitors rose . " I regret that I can not ask you to spend the night , " added Hitler . " We have been so crowded here that our guests have to sleep in tents . " " We have friends waiting for us near Salzburg , " replied Lanny . " They will be more than ever glad to welcome us when they learn of this honor we have enjoyed . " If you can make such speeches at the proper moment you may be assured of enjoying honors in all the courts of the earth . They shook hands with the company , and Irma exchanged a few words with the Frau Reichsminister . As the Fiihrer was escorting them to the door Lanny said : " One thing , Exzellenz : I am wondering if the border is open this late . " " The border is open all night , " was the reply . " If you have any difficulty , phone here and we will straighten it out . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their car , stepped in , and drove away quickly . When they were out of hearing , Lanny whispered : " Are you all right ? " Trudi answered : " Yes ! " " Did anyone look into the car ? " She answered : " A man walked up and down the whole time , but he did n't look in. "  |p261It  was only about fifteen minutes ' drive to the border . Before they reached it Lanny stopped and said to Trudi : " I want you to sink down in your seat out of sight and pretend to be asleep . I have authorityfrom Hitler to pass through , and I do n't believe they will look into the car at all ; so we may get by without mentioning you . " " But suppose they do look and find her ? " objected Irma . " I will say that I did n't suppose they were interested in a servant . Trudi will have her passport and exit permit if they demand it . " He handed them to her . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it 's your funeral . " " I think I know them , " he replied . " Watch my smoke ! " He drove to the border post , stopped quickly , and stepped out of his car before the officials emerged with their flashlights . " Heil Hitler ! " he said , and gave the snappy salute which it was obligatory for every German to return . " Heil Hitler ! " " Heil Hitler ! " Straightway Lanny started his Rolle . " We have just come from a visit to the Berghof , and the Fiihrer assured me that the border would be open . " " Natiirlicb , mein Herr . Die gauze Nacbt . " " He has just instructed me , if there is any delay , to have you call the Berghof and he will personally straighten the matter out . " " Sehr wobl , Herrschaften ! Was wiinschen die Herrschaften ? " " I am an art expert and have just come from Berlin , where I have arranged to dispose of some pictures for the Minister-President GeneralGoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp of his office . Here also are the passports and the exit permits of myself and wife . " " Gewiss , gewiss . Wollen die Herrschaf ten eintreten ? " " Nein , ich wa7te bier . Bitte beeilen Sie sick , es wird spat . " Lanny 's German was good enough so they would n't know he was a foreigner , and his car was one of the sort which confers authority . The officials hastened inside , and in a minute or two emerged with the passport properly stamped . Lanny stepped into his car and started the engine ; the barrier was lifted , and the car rolled into Austria.  |p262SALZBURG  has an " Old Town " which is just the way it was when it was a Prince-Bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire , some eight hundred years ago . It has a cathedral , a castle on a height , and other medieval features ; also , nearly two hundred years ago , an infantcalled Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in one of its old houses . To some wide-awake hotel-owners of recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this had grown into an elaborate music event lasting the whole month of August ; eminent conductors and stage directors were engaged , and crowds came from all over Europe and America . If you wished to have a real holiday you put on Alpine costume , which for the men consisted of dark-gray or brown leather pants , held up by highly ornamental suspenders . The pants stopped above the knees , and made you feel queer , but it was fine for the mosquitoes . You stuck some sort of trophy in your hat , a Gemsbart or a Spielhahnfeder . Perhaps you carried a Bergstock , and climbed the mountains and hunted the wary chamois . In the excitement of getting Trudi Schultz out of Germany Lanny had forgotten this festival . But when they came into the new town they found all the smart shops lighted up and crowds coming out from a concert hall ; he said : " We may have trouble getting rooms . " Trudi had been weeping softly in the back seat . Now she spoke : I must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Nazi ' gents here , and if I am recognized the information will go back to Germany and compromise you hopelessly. "  |p263No  doubt Irma had been weeping into her pillow the previous night , and might do more of it this night ; but Trudi Schultz was n't going to see it , nor was Lanny . In a voice of studied calm , she inquired : " Just where do you plan to go , Miss Schultz ? " " I will go to Paris . I ought to separate from you at once , and not have you or Lanny associated with me in the public mind . " " As to Lanny , " replied Irma , coldly , " I have nothing to say . It is my own intention to take the first train to some port where I can sail for America . You may wish to change your plans when you learn that I shall be traveling alone . " " No , Mrs. Budd , " replied Trudi , " that will not alter my plans . I , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am terribly sorry if I have been the means of making unhappiness between you and him . " She might have gone on , but the more she said , the worse she would have made it . Lanny suggested that their first problem was to find out if there was a room for any of them in Salzburg . He drove to the Hotel Austria , and was informed that they had no vacant rooms and no suggestion as to where such might be found . There were ten thousandvisitors in town . Resorting to the telephone , Lanny got the same information at other places . When he came back to the car , Trudi said : " Let me get out here and take care of myself . " " Where will you go ? " " I will get a cab to the railroad station . There might be a train at any hour , and I want to take myself out of your way . " She handed him Celeste 's papers and got out of the car . Irma might have said : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Lanny said : " You may not find it so easy . You will have to get a certificate of identity from the Austrian authorities . And you will need money . " He took the wad of bills from his pocket and tried to give it to her . " I surely wo n't need so much , " she declared ; " only enough to getp264me to Paris and keep me there for a week or two . I will get work and take care of myself after that . " " It may not be so easy as you think , " he countered . He divided the wad in halves , and put one half into her hand , giving a sharp push , as much as to say : " Shut up and do n't be silly . " Trudi obeyed . " Mrs. Budd , " said she , " I can not go without saying that I am deeply grateful for your help , and with all my heart I regret the trouble I have caused you . " " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it had not been you it would have been someone else . The trouble has been gathering for a long time . " " Good-by , Lanny , " said the artist . She turned to go , but he followed her down the street . " Just a word , please . When you have a permanent address you must send it to me . " " I ought not to see you again  --  " she began . " I 'm not going to let you out of my sight until you give me that promise . " " It is a mistake , Lanny ; it will break up your marriage . " " That is for me to decide . " " I can not bear to be the cause --  " " It is something that you can not help , and it is foolish to try . I refuse to lose track of you . " " Lanny , go back to the car . You will be making your wife furious . " " She has the car and she knows how to drive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if necessary , unless you promise to write me . " " I will write , " she said ; and then burst out : " Oh , Lanny , how dreadful that I should have done this ! " Irma had moved into the driver 's seat . He wondered if she had been about to leave without him ; but all she said was : " Let me. drive . We must go to a near-by town , which will not be so crowded . " " All right , " he answered . Perhaps it was an overture ; and whenp265they were started on the road to Hallein , he began : " There is a lot that I want to say to you , Irma . " " You may say anything you wish ; I do n't want to be rude and I do n't want to quarrel  --  but you must know in advance that your words will be wasted , because my mind is made up . " " You are going to break with me ? " " I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade myself that I could live in Europe , but I know that I hate it . " " You do n't want me to come with you ? " " Not while you think and feel as you do . " " Just what do you mean , dear ? " " You know , and it 's a waste of breath talking about it . " " Tell me , in plain words , just what are your terms . " " All right , if you insist . You can be my husband and you can have my love if you are willing to say one sentence : that never again while you live will you have anything to do with Communismor Communists , or with Socialism or Socialists , or anything resembling them , regardless of what name they give themselves . " He closed his eyes as if from a blow . " You know I ca n't say that , Irma . There are Hansi and Bess , and Uncle Jesse , and Rick and Raoul --  " " I know them all ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Believe me , I have taken a lot of time to think it over  --  about two years and a half , ever since the Nazis came into power and we went into Germany to meet Hansi and Bess . My common sense told me then , as it 's told me every day since : Lanny may be willing to serve as a tail to the Red kite or the Pink one , but such a career is not for me . " A strange thing : he , too , had been hearing a voice of what claimed to be common sense . The suppressed half of his personality leaped suddenly into life , and he was startled by the realization that it would be pleasant not to have to lie ; it would be a relief to be able to say what he really thought and do what he really pleased . Be a man and not a mouse ! There was a long silence ; at last Irma said : " Let us talk about practical questions . In the morning I shall return to Salzburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to a steamer . If you will give me Celeste 's papers I will take them to her , or airmailthem and instruct her where to meet me . Shall I ship your bags to Bienvenu , or in care of Beauty in London ? " " I will think it over and let you know , " he replied , in a low voice . " I hope we do not have to quarrel , Lanny . I have had times of bitterness , when I hated what you believed and was tempted to hate you for believing it . But I am prepared to respect your right to your own opinions , and I hope you will do the same . " " Certainly , " he replied . " I still love you , you know . " " I have thought about it a great deal . I do not believe there can be love where there is a fundamental disagreement in ideas ; certainly , at any rate , there can not be any happiness in such love . I do not believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . " " No , " he assented . One half of him grieved to say it , while the other half was glad . " There are matters to be settled about Frances . If we can keep bitterness out of our hearts , we wo n't have to pull her this way and that , or teach her to distrust either of her parents . " " Oh , surely we must n't do that , Irma ! " " Before we left the Adlon , I was tempted to make it my conditionfor helping that woman , that I was to have the right to keep Frances at Shore Acres . But I decided to rely upon your good sense in the matter . You will always be free to come there and to be with her . If you will try not to force your ideas upon her , I will not have to teach her to fear those ideas . " He saw how she had been spending the hours of that long drive through Germany ; he hated to admit , even to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way . He had thought : " If it were a boy , I would put up a fight for his mind ; but a daughter  --  no , she will have to be Irma 's daughter ! " The **30;8667;TOOLONG would be ruled by her twenty-three million dollars ! Lanny had tried to have some effect upon the upbringing of Marceline , and had learned how fixed the ladies are in their ways , how complete is their solidarity and how powerful their discipline.  | " There 's one serious problem , " he said . " Beauty is going to feel herself robbed . " " Beauty has always been kind to me , and all this is not her fault . I will do everything in my power to keep from making her unhappy . She can come to Shore Acres whenever she pleases ; I will give her a house on my estate , just as she gave me one on hers . And that goes for you , too  --  anything , so long as we do n't quarrel , or intrigue against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen cases like that , and it is the worst thing that can happen to a young mind ; it can wreck her entire life . " " We must permit nothing of that sort , " he replied . " As a matter of fact , Beauty is going to blame me for this mess . " " She will tell you that , " said Irma ; " but of course it wo n't be true . " The utility king 's daughter had acquired considerable understandingof psychology during six years ' association with a munition salesman 's ex-mistress ! Hallein is an old and poor town , but they managed to get two connecting rooms in a hotel , and Irma retired to her room with a polite " Good night . " As a matter of courtesy she refrained from locking her door , and Lanny , equally courteous , refrained from going near it . Perhaps if he had stolen in and sat on the edge of her bed and wooed her , he might have won her back and persuaded her to give him another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his heart ached with anticipatory loneliness . Was she tempted , too ? His door was not locked , and she might have stolen in and said : " Oh , Lanny , I love you ! Believe what you please , do what you please , I still love you ! " They might have gone on , living a sort of cat-and-dog life , like many other couples they knew . But no , she had laid down her terms and she would stick by them . Lanny thought : " Can I make promises like that ? Can I make promisesin any way resembling them ? " His answer was " No . " At least , that was the answer part of the time ; but then he would think of that lovely body , lying there waiting for him , perhaps aching for him ; then there would be in his soul a duel like that between fiend and conscience which had gone on in the soul of Launcelot Gobbo . " Budge , ' says the fiend . Budge not , ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have had a hard time deciding which was fiend and which was conscience ; it would depend upon the rank you assigned to a man 's marital vows and the affection he owed to the mother of his child , as against whatever he might owe to the exploited proletariat , whose ill-requited toil had provided his leisure , his culture  --  all those things which set him apart from the aforesaid proletariat . They met politely in the morning . A quick glance at her face showed him that she had been weeping ; also that she had done her best with powder and rouge to hide the fact . Was she hurt because he had not come to her ? Had her pride been wounded by his pride ? He would never know ; he had been pushed out of her heart and would not be taken back . When a surgeon cuts living flesh he does not do it by slow degrees ; he makes his knife sharp and cuts quickly ; and at once the severed stump begins to heal over , forming its own skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from King Lear : " He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven , and fire us hence like foxes . " Here was the brand , and its heat was fierce , and the pain of it . Irma did n't want any breakfast , she said ; just a cup of coffee ; she wanted to drive to Salzburg at once , so as to get a morning train . All right , he would take her , omitting no final courtesy . At the travel bureau she learned that , as she had guessed , the quickest route was by Berlin and Bremen . She would take a German steamer  --  why not ? She had always liked the Germans , always got along with them ; and there was no reason in the world why she should not proceed through Germany . Was she not a friend of the Fiihrer , having made her personal declaration of support only the previous evening ? It gave Lanny a fresh realization of what the brand from heaven was doing to them . She was going her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as he had . She would choose her own friends , thinkp269her own thoughts , and speak them  --  doubtless with the same sense of relief which he felt , but which as yet he hardly dared acknowledge to himself . Was it that way with her ? Apparently not . He was surprised by her decisiveness of words and manner . She had a job to put through and she was doing it . Could it be that she was a harder person than he ; more selfish , or at any rate less sentimental ? How could it be otherwise , if she was going to be a Nazi or to toleratethe Nazis ? He had a sudden vision of what it would mean to give up his little daughter . Poor kid ! She would be brought up in that world ; and when she was forty would she look like Magda Goebbels ? Thinkingsuch thoughts , Lanny discovered that he might have a hard time not coming to hate the mother of his child . It was a hateful world in which she lived , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the makers of it . She had n't been interested in politics so far ; but Lanny had made that change in her . She would understand what politics meant from now on  --  the defense of her fortune and her privileges . She would know who was threatening to take them away and what measures to use against those enemies .. Quite a train of thought to have been started by watching a woman pay for train and steamer accommodations and order her reservations telegraphed ahead ! Then waiting while she wrote a telegram to her maid and a cablegram to her mother  --  and not telling him what she was saying in either ! There was just time to catch the train . He drove her to the station , and they stood together on the platform , waiting for the noisy monster which was to separate their lives . Lanny had got himself together ; they had too many memories of happiness , and must not spoil them entirely . " If we must part forever , give me but one kind word to think upon " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Do n't be too unhappy , Lanny ; and do n't throw yourself away . We must n't either of us have the other on our conscience . "  | " No , indeed , " he replied . " You have been very good to me , perhapstoo good , and I shall always be grateful . " " I feel the same way , Lanny . You have taught me a lot  --  even though you may not believe it . " What did she mean by " throwing himself away " ? Was she referringto Trudi Schultz ? She had seen Lanny walk away with the woman . Had he told her to wait for him here in Salzburg or elsewhere ? Nothing was more likely . Irma would n't take much stock in the idea that Trudi would go on pining for Ludi . No , Lanny Budd was a " catch , " and any woman who could get him would take him . But it was n't Irma 's affair , and she had no right to refer to it . One could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lives alone . When she left him , she gave him the right to go and find some other woman . " One thing more , Irma , " he said ; " a matter of real importance to me . " " Yes , Lanny ? " " You know that I have been playing a double game in Germany . I could not do what I wish to do if the Nazis knew my real feelings . " " I understand that . " " I would like to have an agreement that we will not talk about the reason for our parting . It is really nobody 's business . " " That is fair . " " Your family and your friends will not be too deeply grieved because you have left me . It will suffice if you say that our tastes do not agree , and that we prefer different company and different parts of the world to live in . " " You are right . " " You understand , " he persisted , " I might some day get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me because I was working against the Nazis . " " I have no desire to get you into any trouble , " she assured him . " You may count upon me not to discuss your affairs or your beliefs with anyone . " The train came in . Lanny put his wife in her compartment and set her solitary bag beside her . " Good-by , dear , and God blessp271you ! " There were tears in the eyes of both ; it was a tragic moment . But the world was full of many kinds of tragedy . What people think about it and what they want to do about it makes them into different sorts of persons , and they can not live in the same house or even in the same land . The parting between Irma Barnes and Lanny Budd was like the parting between Germany and Czechoslovakia , for example , or that between the Soviet Union and Finland , or that between the New Dealers and the old-line Republicans in Washington . It was a world-wide phenomenon , and if Lanny and Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end until it had split the whole world down the middle . He stood on the platform and saw the train depart , with such a sense of desolation as he had never before known in his life . A part of his body , his mind , and his soul had been torn from him ; and all of him was one ache . Was he ever going to see her again ? And what was going to take her place in his life ? His very automobile seemed different , like an empty house . The seat where she had sat would he haunted ; when he sat at table to eat a meal , the seat beside him would be haunted ; when he lay in bed it would be the same . He wished he had insisted that Trudi Schultz should wait for him . It would have been fun to motor her to Paris , a polite brother-andsisterjaunt . He thought of looking up the trains , and perhaps meetingher at the station . But no , he realized that they must not be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , it would have to be in secret . Easy enough to arrange that in Paris , but not on the road , for one who had as many friends as Lanny Budd . Gossips would get busy quickly  --  he must prepare his mind for that , among other unpleasantness . Beauty would hear about it soon  --  and , oh , God , what tears , what agonies of soul ! Lanny decided hurriedly that wherever he went for a while , it would be some place where his mother was n't ! He was free ; free as the wind ; he could go in any direction  --  even back into Germany , if he so desired . He had several thousand marks in cash in his pockets , and a fine car ; not many men would have wasted away with grief under the circumstances . True , he no longer had the Barnes millions at command , but he had his profession and his valuable card-file  --  presumably not all the rich would drop him because his wife had done so . Also , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could sell one whenever he needed the price of a meal ! He thought it would be pleasant to meet Zoltan Kertersi and talk about pictures . Zoltan had been in Paris , but he was a flea , and you might meet him walking down the street in Salzburg ; if Lanny sent him a wire he would step into a plane and come . It would have been pleasant punting on the River Thames and talking to Rick , he being one of the few to whom Lanny could tell his troubles . Just to think of him was to be braced in soul ; to hear his voice saying : " It 's a damn good thing ! It 'll make a man out of you ! " But Rick was some distance away , and if Lanny went to him , how could he keep from running into Beauty ? Then he thought of Hansi and Bess . They , too , were persons to whom he had a right to pour out his heart . He had n't seen them for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him  --  South America , Hawaii , Japan , and now this Comintern Congress ! How long was the thing likely to last ? He decided that his half-sister and her husband were the persons he wanted with him at this unhappy moment ; they would be glad , perhaps even gladder than Rick . They had come to dislike Irma  --  he knew it , in spite of the fact that they tried to hide it . They would welcome him with open arms and let him drive them wherever he wished . They would go back to Bienvenuand play violin and piano duets for a year and a day ! Hansi 's comings and goings were usually determined by concert dates . But now the couple had bolted across Siberia in a hurry , on account of the Congress , so it might be a time when they were footlooseand could have a real holiday . They would labor to make a Communist out of him , of course ; but he would n't mind  --  he might even let them succeed for a while . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose from Irma Barnes ! He had no address for them , but he knew that distinguished artistswere demigods in the Soviet Union  --  that was one of the finep273things you could say about the place . He sent a telegram , addressed to " Hansi Robin , American violinist , care of Intourist , Moscow , " and reading : " Attending festival Irma returned to New York incompatibility what are your plans suggest returning via Vienna waiting here have car reply Salzburg care American Express Lanny . " He guessed that the word " incompatibility " would tell them a bookful , and he would n't have to add " lonesome " or anything like that . " Have car " would help . Bessie Budd , who had also been brought up in a motor-car , would say : " Oh , the poor fellow ! We ought to go right away , Hansi . " Lanny , knowing them so well , could hear the violinist answer : " In Salzburg , with so much music day and night , anybody can be happy . Let us see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reply came it said : " Concert engagement prevents immediate leaving will arrive approximatelyone week cheerio conclusion inevitable new horizons beckon you magnificent celebrations here constructive decisions followingyour party line never say die oceans love Hansibess . " All that was clear , too , and Lanny was pleased to see that his sister'srevolutionary zeal had not entirely stifled her Yankee sense of humor . For many years Lanny had been lamenting the factional disputesof the left-wingers , which exposed them all to the menace of advancing Fascism ; so now , when the Comintern had formally declaredfor the united front with all anti-Fascist elements , it was a masterpiece of family tact to say that the representatives of fifty nations in convention assembled were following the party line of Lanny Budd ! And when the mountain so politely came to Mahomet , surely he could n't reject its advances ! Lanny did n't bother about hunting a room , because he would n't mind driving twice a day through lovely mountain scenery . He strolled from the Residenzplatz to the Platzl , and from there to the Cafe Bazar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park and Park Avenue wearing Dirndl costumes , the garb of Tirolesepeasant girls , consisting of elaborately embroidered aprons overp274flowered skirts coming up to a low-cut bodice with broad bands at the shoulders . The men who accompanied them , sometimes bald or gray-whiskered , each hoped to be mistaken for a Rua , a peasant lad , and failed to realize how their bare white knees gave them away . " Salontiroler , " they were called by the natives . Lanny Budd , who had met the members of smart society in a dozen capitals , greeted several persons and might at once have been " in the swim , " but it suited his mood to go alone and brood . He stood by the parapet of a bridge and watched the noisy River Salzach cutting the town in half . He inspected the Magic Flute House . He wandered into the Getreidegasse and climbed three flights of stairs to the little four-room apartment where the Mozart family had lived . He inspected the porcelain stove at which the tiny mite of genius had warmed his fingers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clavichord on which the child had learned his delicateand gracious art . Realizing that he was hungry , a footloose and fancy-free bachelor strolled to the Traube and ordered a Wienerschnitzel and a GosserBier . Meanwhile he studied the program of the Festspiele . Tickets were scarce , but if you were willing to pay an extra sum you could find what you wanted , and Lanny proceeded to schedule for himself a week of exalted delights  --  broken only by occasional pangs when he thought of Irma traveling alone and weeping into strange pillows . However , she had little Frances waiting for her ; also Mother Fanny Barnes and Uncle Horace Vandringham , to both of whom Lanny was prepared to give her a quitclaim deed . With the background of a great fortress on a high rock was a lovely spot known as the Mirabell gardens . A casino had been installedthere and you might play all the gambling-games and think you were at Monte Carlo . Also there was a modest bandstand , and in the afternoon you might listen to music . As Lanny strolled through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth anybody 's time to hear , so he seated himself on one of the shaded benches of which many rows had been provided . He sat with closed eyes , accepting a great soul 's invitation to forget the pomps and vanities of this wicked world.  |p275He  was only partly aware of the fact that somebody came and sat on the bench beside him . But presently he began to experience a peculiar feeling ; the bench was shaking slightly , as if the other person was breathing hard , or perhaps was afflicted with palsy . Peoplehave different ways of responding to the incitements of music , and after this piece was concluded Lanny stole a glance out of the corner of his eye at the middle-aged , rather stoutish gentleman at his side , and realized that he was sobbing softly to himself ; carefully repressing every sound , but there were tears streaming down his cheeks and he was making no effort to check or remove them . This was n't a place of Anglo-Saxon formality , but of Austrian Gemiitlicht eit ; so Lanny remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gott ! " exclaimed the stranger . " Ein Meister der nicht genug gew-ti-rdigt ist ! " It happened that Lanny reciprocated this sentiment , so while waiting for the next number they discussed the Abbe Franz Liszt , the sorrows which had dogged him and the dreams which had inspired ' him . Apparently it was a Liszt program , for the orchestra played a Liebestraurn , which proved to be another provocation , to tears . Lanny wondered if , the gentleman manifested all his musical feelings in this embarrassing way . From his accent , and also from the fact that there was nothing Austrian about his costume , Lanny guessed that he was an Austrian . From the fact that his light summer suit was so clean , he guessed that he was a man of means . After they had heard and discussed the rest of the program , they were friends according to festival custom , and Lanny invited him to some refreshment .. They strolled to the nearest Restauration , and after they had exchanged names , Herr Gensmann broke down , wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had the most dreadful of sorrows that could overwhelm a man at a Musikfest  --  he had brought his wife for a delightful holiday ; and she had moved ' herself into the quarters of an actor who , was playing a minor role in Hofmannsthal 's Jedertnann ! Just leaving him a note , saying that she was no longer happy with him and hoping he would find his Gluck elsewhere . " And what can I do ? " lamented the suffering stranger . " We are '  |p276no  longer in the Middle Ages , and I can not go and drag her back by the hair of her head  --  and anyhow , she is a large woman . Alas , she has money of her own , and unless this actor fellow should lose it all at the gaming-table I can have no hope that she will ever return to me . Oh , such a lovely woman , Herr Budd  --  a cascade of golden hair , limbs like alabaster , eyes as blue as sapphires "  --  Herr Gensmann was speaking as an expert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into details concerning the charms of his lost Schatz which left nothing to another married man 's imagination . It might have been a relief to Lanny Budd to have said : " A strange coincidence , lieber Freund ; auch ich hab ' meine Frau verloren ! " But Anglo-Saxon reticence made it impossible  --  and besides , it would have set the gossips to work . Herr Gensmann might know any or all of those Viennese Hochgeborenen whose art treasures Lanny Budd had purchased . No ; lock your own heart tight , and let the foreigner provide the flow of sentimentality ! Lanny was graciously sympathetic , and the result was important to him , for his new friend asked where he was staying ; learning that he had no room , but was intending to motor back and forth , the economical Austrian soul was shocked , and he said : " My friend , let me offer you hospitality . My wife and I had each a room , and now  --  ach leider !  --  one is empty ! Why should you not occupy it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife should return ? " " I have no hope ; she is a woman of dominating passions . But if she should come , you will be no worse off than at present . Let me explain that we are paying guests in the home of a very fine Salzburgfamily , Herr Pergler , an official of the city administration . I have engaged room and board for two through the duration of the festival . " " But would these people be willing to accept an entire stranger ? " " You perhaps do not understand the customs of this event , HerrBudd ; everybody makes room for as many Pensioniir as possible.  |p277You  must know that since the dreadful war everybody in our mutilatedcountry is poor , and in Salzburg many families live the other eleven months of the year out of what they receive for taking care of guests during the month of August . You will meet an interesting family , and unless you have been a paying guest in the past you may find it an amusing experience . " " That is kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will permit me to pay my half of the expenses for the time I am with you , I shall be pleased to accept . " Certainly Lanny did find the Pergler family interesting . They lived in one of those large apartment buildings which are prominent in the city , having a chimney-pot for every other tier of windows ; the streets are narrow , and at night the district buzzed like a beehive . Lanny assumed that the members of the family must be sleeping on the kitchen floor ; for the jeweler had the living-room and Lanny the room just behind it , separated by a curtain which it was necessary to push aside on account of the heat . All shared the bathroom , and crowded about the small table in the dining-room . Lanny had never before lived in such close proximity to other human beings ; but it was made easy by the charming good humor and naivete of this family . They were all young , or acted that way . Mutter Pergler was sprightly and gay , with a mass of black hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and lively , wearing pincenez and a sharp little dark mustache . There were two daughters , Julie and Auguste , one sixteen and the other fourteen ; they had been named for the months they were born in , but " Gusti " had come first . Also there was little Hansel , the kid brother , who like all such brothers would have told the family secrets , only this familyleft nothing to tell . They were tremendously thrilled to have an American movie star  --  for so Lanny seemed to them  --  walk into their house ; they had all been to the movies and were fully informed about that miraculous land where poor workinggirls live in rooms the size of ballrooms and always have their hair perfectly waved . Lanny owned a car , which made him many times over a millionaire , and when he took the family for a ride he conferred delight beyond imagining . Not only were they getting twenty-five Austrian schillings a day from him , but they were going to get English lessons as well . They made a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German , and it produced amazing phenomena , because they all wanted to talk , sometimes more than one at a time , and they pronouncedEnglish the way it looked to Germans and ordered the words as in German . They did n't mind if Lanny laughed  --  the nicest thing about them was that they laughed at themselves as well as at each other and all the rest of the world . They were the oddest combination of sophistication and simplicity ; they were certain that they were the world 's most artistic people , but also its most unfortunate . Pretenses were impossible ; only art , beauty , and laughter were left to an Austrian . The third supper that Lanny enjoyed in this home  --  plain country food , with delicacies embarrassingly served for the guests while all the others pretended they did n't care for them  --  Lanny saw tears running down the cheeks of the slender pale lily named Gusti . He thought it was the Schlagobers he was putting on his fruit , and he offered her some , whereupon she burst into tears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mutter Pergler , " do n't give her attentions , bitte , it is just that she has in love with you fallen . " " Oh , no ! " exclaimed the shocked Pensioner . " Do not yourself trouble , " said the mother , comfortingly . " It is just the age that she comes to . " " She believes that they are a prince , " added Julie , addressing Lanny in the plural as she would have done in German . " She is getting a camera  --  what is it ? " put in the kid brother . " To picture , to have for Andacht verrichten --  " " To say her prayers to , " explained the mother , forgetting that Lanny knew German better than he knew the Pergler English . " It will all be well when you are going , Herr Budd . She will love/memories cherish when there is music . Aber , bitte , do not allow that she shall run away with you . " " Oh , surely not , Frau Pergler ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry her , " suggested Julie , politely . " How could he marry her , " argued the Mutter , " when he already in America a wife has ? " Said the head of the family , who spoke fairly good English : " There is a place called Reno that they can go to . " He pronounced it as if it were German : Rain-o . " Is it then so wet as we have it here ? " inquired Julie , not making a pun , but seekinginformation . With these family scenes as comedy interludes in the Shakespeareantradition Lanny went from one to another of the great events of the festival . He saw Faust as a Reinhardt spectacle , also the morality play called Everyman  --  giving special attention to that actor who had extended his hospitality to Herr Gensmann 's wife ! He heard the Vienna Philharmonic perform Mendelssohn 's ReformationSymphony , also Bruckner 's Fourth . He heard Don Giovanni conducted by Bruno Walter , and Fidelio conducted by Toscanini . In a chamber concert hall he listened to a very fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have played the piano if he had ever really had to work . The great adagio movement began with Lanny 's grief because Irma had left him , and ended , as always with the major works of Beethoven , as a lament for all the sorrows which tyranny and greed had inflicted upon the human race . Sometimes he took his newly made friends with him . They sat in the summer courtyard of the Residenz on a lovely warm evening and listened to a string orchestra playing Mozart 's Serenades . It was dark , except for dim lights at the desks of the musicians ; the lovesmittenGusti sat as close to Lanny as it was possible to get and shiveredwith bliss . There was n't anything he could do about it , except to take it as her parents did , a biological phenomenon ; girls were that way when they got that way , and all any Mutter or Vater could do was to urge her to eat her meals , so that she would n't fade away entirely . Lanny escorted them all to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salami sandwich , and she obeyed , gazing at him with adoring sheep 's eyes in the meantime . The town was crawling with celebrities , and autograph-hunters flitted here and there . The gossip-collectors cocked their ears ; so many people were misbehaving in one way or another that it was really delightful . What chuckles when the tempestuous Toscanini was scheduled to open a concert with the overture to Rossini 's Ladderof Silk , but the score and parts had been lost ; he had taken them home to mark certain nuances , and they had vanished . He played all the other numbers on the program while a frantic search was made  --  two separate trips to his villa , and finally the missing papers were found in the bottom of his laundry-basket ; his chauffeur had carried them into the kitchen , and the maid had found what she thought was a safe resting-place . Even upon the shrine of the Muses rude politics forced its way . Salzburg stood for the freedom of art , which meant that without intendingit , indeed while terrified by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam-roller . First of all , the Jewish question . This was the twelfth season in which Max Reinhardt had produced those spectacleswhich had won fame throughout the world and brought visitorsby the thousands . One of the favorite conductors , Bruno Walter , was a Jew ; also , Toscanini had refused to conduct at Bayreuth as a protest against Nazi interference in the affairs of art . Since the music of Mendelssohn was banned from Germany , the maestro reviveda long-neglected symphony , the Reformation , and gave it here several times with eclat . As a result , Hitler had imposed a thousandmarkfee for visas , making it impossible for German artists and touriststo attend the festival . The rest of Europe had responded by making it impossible to find hotel accommodations in the town . It was war , and the Salzburgers shivered with dread every time they thought about it . Up there in the mountains dwelt the ogre , glaring down upon them . Last summer he had murdered their Chan/cellor Dollfuss , and what would he do this summer ? There had been serious talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Namen , how would the Perglers and thousands of other families have had anything to eat during the winter ? And without art , what would they have had to live for ? Every time the thunder rumbled they shivered in their beds , wondering if the ogre had hauled guns up the new road he had built and was starting to pound their tiny historic city into rubble and ashes . An hour 's drive to the north of here , in the valley of the River Inn , lay the town of Braunau , where this ogre had been born , or perhaps hatched ; and Papa Pergler interpreted him according to geophysicalprinciples . There were , he insisted , chemical substances in the heavy fogs which arose from the Innviertel which affected its residents with strange forms of madness . A gently rolling and beautifulcountry , all the more dangerous to its inhabitants and to the outside world because it lulled suspicions by its peaceful appearance . From it had come an immense German epic known as Meier Helmbrecht , which tells about a peasant boy who leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigand knight ; he comes back , riding a fine horse and followed by a train of lovely ladies , and astounds the people of his native valley by the splendor of his gifts . " Is that not a direct prophecy of Adi ? " asked the Salzburg public servant . And that was only one of many instances . In that same Innviertel had lived a man who called himself a doctor , and took his patients into a dark chamber , rubbed them with a little electrical stick , and cured them of their diseases . He had prospered so greatly that the government had preferred to collect taxes from him instead of puttinghim in jail . Also a man who had made gold out of salt water ; he had succeeded in interesting the last Kaiser in the enterprise , and had become so rich that he bought the Braunau castle which contained the tomb of Attila . " Get yourself one idea , the crazier the better , and say it a million times , " said Herr Pergler , and added that the coat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bullwashers . " At the fair held in the district a prize had been offered for the best white bull , and one group of growers had no white one , but had taken a fine black one and set out to make it white with soap and water . They had persisted to the very end and had entered the black bull as white . Said Lanny 's host : " You may be certain that at least one of those Stierwascher was named Schickl-gruber . " Lanny had telegraphed his address to " Hansibess , " and in due course received a wire telling him that they were leaving Moscow , and then another stating on what morning they would arrive . He was on hand to meet them , and drove them down into the lovely Salzkammergut , summer playground of Austria . They could talk freely in the car without fear of eavesdroppers ; also while sitting on a mossy bed by the side of a tumbling mountain stream . Lanny had had a lunch put up , so they had the whole day undisturbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had no end of things to talk about . To Lanny their arrival was a blessing ; they helped to heal the wounds of his spirit , and gave him courage to maintain his own integrity of mind and purpose . Lanny and Irma had made an agreement that neither would mentionTrudi Schultz in connection with their separation . It would inevitablymean a sex-story , for who would believe denials by either of them ? They were going to say that they were parting because of " incompatibility " ; seven syllables from the Latin which can be made to cover a multitude of sins ! Now Lanny thought it enough to say that he had wanted to help the underground movement against Hitler , and Irma had become angry and had decided to go home . Everythingher husband believed annoyed her , and it had got so they could no longer talk about the events of the world or tolerate each other 's friends . Said Bess : " You ca n't imagine what a relief that telegram was , Lanny . It had seemed to us that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged around at her apron strings . An utterly impossible situation , and we both hope it is over for good . "  |p283The  granddaughter of the Puritans had matured into a clear-sighted and determined woman . She was twenty-seven , and a decade of continualpiano practice had developed a sturdy physique . Her features were regular , though the nose was a trifle long and thin ; she greatly resembled her mother , who was shocked by her ideas and the companyshe kept , but was able to recognize the functioning of the New England conscience . Bess wore her straight brown hair in a bob , and had devised for herself a simple dress for all purposes . It was in one piece , opening at the shoulder and slipping over the head . She had it made of different materials , but always dark brown , with a little gold braid at the shoulders and a belt of the same ; no other ornaments . When she came onto the platform , following her husband , she went straight to the piano and seated herself , and her aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but listen to the music of great men . " When she finished an accompaniment , she sat still , unless Hansi came and brought her forward to make a bow . All her life was lived on the same plane ; she labored to perfect her art , and likewise her mind and character . She would tolerate no frivolity or cynicism , and when she heard such sentiments expressed she would rebuke them by silence . She had just been having a great experience and was flushed with enthusiasm concerning it . She had found the Russians to be kindred spirits ; seriosniye ludi , that is to say , " serious people , " interested in remaking their world in accordance with rational principles . Corrupt and self-indulgent individuals there were , of course , and self-seeking politicians ; but the mass of the young people had grown up ' with the idea of making a free workers ' commonwealth . All of them were laboring diligently , studying and thinking . They were pioneers , not so different from those forefathers of Bess who had landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the right to follow their own consciences . The youth whom Lanny had once called the shepherd boy out of ancient Judea was now a man of thirty ; tall and slender , with large dark eyes , wavy black hair , and an expression of great sweetness . But not without sternness , for he was a child of the Prophets , and his forefathers had taught those of Bess . It had been with the old Hebrew Testament in their hands that the Puritans had found courage to brave the stormy ocean and risk starvation and massacre by savages . So these two were one in their faith as in their art , and they had found confirmation of all they believed in that Comintern assembly of four hundred men and women from fifty nations of the earth . What speeches , what parades and celebrations  --  and , above all , what music ! To the Jewish violinist and the American accompanist it had been worth many years of hard work to come out upon a platform and play the Tchaikovsky concerto for audiences so eager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that sort of mind and could enjoy that firm clear faith . But at any rate he was free to hear them without having any sense of guilt ! He could talk to any sort of people he liked , and not feel that he was displeasing his wife ! He told about his interview with Hitler ; what the Fiihrer had said about the Comintern Congress , and then what Irma had said to the Fiihrer . Lanny had been asking himself over and over : " Did she really mean that , or was it just a burst of rage ? " He put the question to Hansi and Bess , and the latter said : " Those Nazis will be swarming to Shore Acres , and she 'll be running the most elegant salon for Jew-baiters ! " Lanny mentioned the queer regime under which he was now living . The Perglers had heard of the Hansi Robins and clamored to meet them ; so , toward sundown , the Pensioner drove his relatives back to Salzburg . He packed his bag and paid his debts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also to a song recital of a unique sort  --  the American Negro contralto , Marian Anderson , setting a sophisticated European audience on fire with her singing of spirituals . A perfect evening  --  except that at the parting the lovelorn Gusti fell into a dead swoon , and Lanny had to take her and her . mother home in the car . He carried the girl upstairs to the apartment and she fainted again in his arms . It certainly made a dramatic climax to a festival week.  |p285After  midnight the three travelers set out on their journey , and spent the night at a roadside inn . Next morning they rolled southwardthrough the Bremner Pass with its steep pine-tree-covered mountainsides , its roaring streams and small green lake . Here is the main gateway into Italy , by which the Teutonic invaders came ; later , over a period of six hundred years , the historians are able to count sixty-six emperors who traversed these twenty-five miles upon one errand or another . To Lanny Budd the most real was an empress by the name of Irma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times  --  the last time less than two years ago , after their futile attempt to get Freddi Robin released from the Dachau concentrationcamp . Lanny did n't mention it to the stern granddaughter of the Puritans , but one half his being was an ache of longing for Irma , and he kept thinking : " Can I let her go ? "  |p288BIEN  VEN U was vacant except for the servants , who had been well content to own the place for a while and be paid for it . The pale-blue paint was beginning to look dingy on the wood trim of the stucco buildings , and ordinarily Lanny would have set workmen to sprucing things up before the season began . But now Irma was gone , and perhaps they were going to be poor ; he ignored the suggestionsin his mother 's letters and saved her money . He and his guests took possession of the Villa for sleeping and meals ; the rest of the time they spent in Lanny 's studio , waking the Cap d'Antibes with music , and afterward swimming off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing a lot of traveling , and were glad of this respite , the pleasantest they could have imagined . Nobody to bother them ; no company save the greatest and best . " A good book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit , embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life "  --  so John Milton had written ; and here were books , including Milton 's , lining the walls , and in the vacant spaces paintings of Marcel Detaze , and several cabinets with stacks of music for both violin and piano , Lanny 's accumulation from boyhood . These master-spirits did not intrude themselves , but awaited your convenience ; when you took them from the shelves they poured out treasures more precious than all the wealth of Ormuzand of Ind , or where the gorgeous East with richest hand show'rs on her kings barbaric pearl and gold . It was unfortunate that Lanny and his relatives could n't have lived with the poets and composers , and left the evil problems of the time to solve themselves . But Bess was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoping to convert her half-brother once for all and dedicate him to righteousness as a member of the Communistparty of France . It all seemed so obvious and simple to her ; she had a set of formulas as carefully worked out as any proposition of Euclid  --  and to her mind as compelling . All that one had to do was to understand and accept them , and further thought on the subjectbecame superfluous . It was a military view of society . The great mass of the world 's workers were in chains , the invisible chains of the competitive wage system ; there were only two things to be done : first , make them aware of the chains and , second , guide them in throwing them off . This double job required a discipline known as the dictatorship of the proletariat ; then , when both jobs were done , the evil state machinewould wither away and the workers would rule themselves in a free society . All this was elementary , and after the demonstration in the Soviet Union there was no longer any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , and workers of other lands had only to follow in their footsteps . But to Lanny it seemed more complicated . Old Russia had had virtually no middle class , and the governing class had been paralyzed by defeat in war . But other countries had a large middle class , selfconsciousand powerful , and when you tried to jam through your proletarian revolution , what you got was Mussolini or Hitler ! So then came arguments : Who was t4 blame for the wrong kind of dictators ? How had they come ? Lanny thought he ought to know , for he had been there and seen . Grant that Mussolini and Hitler were agents of the capitalist class , subsidized to put down the Communists ; that did n't change the fact that they had succeeded , or the fact that success was based upon their posing as members of the lower middle class , saving it from being ground between the millstones of capital and labor . Lanny argued : " In the English-speaking countries we have at least partial democracy in political affairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the economic sphere ? Would n't that be wiser than risking everything , and perhaps losing it as you have seen the workers do in Italy and Germany ? "  | But that meant the parliamentary system ; it meant going into bourgeois politics  --  and so came a vehement debate . Look at Ramsay MacDonald , look at boondoggling and the N.R.A . and the other messes of the New Deal ! Look at what had happened in Spain in the last four or five years ! The people had made a revolution , they had driven out the wretched Alfonso and put in a jurist and man of lettersnamed Azana , who had believed so completely in moving graduallythat he had stood entirely still , and the starving workers and peasants had been so discouraged that two years later the so-called Anti-Marxist Coalition had been able to carry the elections . " You will see the same thing here in France if you elect a parlor aesthete for your Premier ! " exclaimed Bess . " A Socialist lawyer who makes elegant speeches , but would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred families ! " " Is that the way you look upon Blum ? " asked Lanny , surprised  --  or pretending to be . " I thought your Comintern Congress had just ordered a front populaire ? " " We 're willing to do our part , " replied the granddaughter of the Puritans . " But that does n't obligate us to fool ourselves as to the outcome . " Said Lanny : " I doubt very much if anybody can give effective co-operation in a  --  cause that he feels is bound to fail . It will be humanlyimpossible not to show your real attitude , and you 'll be helpingto bring about the very failure you expect . " So went the controversy ; and after a few days and nights of it they had to agree that they disagreed , and would not talk about current problems any more . The same truce that Lanny had had to make with Irma ! The fact was , these issues had become so urgent and feelings ran so high that tolerance was too difficult . All over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go where they would meet their political rivals . The task of a salonniere such as Emily Chattersworth now exceeded her powers . In the old days she had been able to act as moderator , and when arguments becamep291too hot to turn them off with a witticism ; but now the contending intellectuals would almost come to blows , and the more dignified and less noisy would refuse to return unless they were assured that only their sort was to be present . It was the same also in the Ecole des Travailleurs du Midi ; the Socialist and the Communist students had been arguing for years , and while Lanny was overseas they had come to a break . The Communistswere accused of trying to sabotage the institution and were expelled in a body . Raoul had written Lanny a long letter about it , which Lanny had n't known how to answer . Now , as the first effect of the front populaire program , the Communists wanted to be taken back and have another chance . But the moderates insisted that the Communists had shown themselves incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere about anything except the promotionof their party , and , no matter what promises they made , they would always be " boring from within . " Raoul Palma of course had to know what Lanny advised . Irma being gone and Beauty not yet come , Lanny could invite him over to Bienvenu to lunch  --  cautioning him not to bring up the question in the presence of two Red musicians ! No , said Raoul , it was his hope that Hansi and Bess would come over and play at an evening affair , which might serve as a kind of ceremony of reconciliation . At least both Reds and Pinks could listen to the same music ! Lanny went for a walk with his friend , enjoying the opportunity to exchange ideas with somebody who did n't consider him an idler and a weakling . What was this about Spain ? he asked , knowing that refugees were coming and going and that Raoul was in touch with most of them . A terrible situation , the school director replied ; in a so-called republic the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army and the church forces , and thirty thousand were starving and dying in the foul prisons of that unhappy land . Elections were to take place early in the new year , and already the campaign was under way . All the workers ' groups throughout France were beingasked to contribute funds . If Comrade Lanny could make a donation  --  andComrade Lanny of course said that he would . Conditions were disturbing here in the Midi , also . The Fascist groups were becoming more and more active , and were resorting to gangsterism , as in all the countries bordering on Italy and Germany . They were provided with funds not only from French capitalist sources , but also from abroad . Italian agents were working openly , boasting that they meant to bring all the Mediterranean shores under their system . Some fourteen years ago Lanny had heard Mussolini declare : " Fascismo is not for export . " He had accepted the statement then , but now he understood that what Fascismo said and what Fascismo did bore no necessary relationship . What were the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Arm themselves ? But that gave the enemy a basis for charging that the workers were planning civil war . The reactionaries had ninetenthsof the money , also nine-tenths of the press with which to spread confusion and fear . Said Raoul : " The extreme Left has Russia for a pattern and the Right has Italy and Germany , but where is the pattern for those who believe in the democratic process ? " " We have to make our own pattern , " was the reply . " We have to educate the people and organize them into our new united front . We must oust Laval and his gang , and put in Leon Blum . " What was Lanny himself going to do ? Merely give advice , which is so cheap all over the world ? No , there was something expected of those few among the Socialists who had money . The grandson of Budd 's must give until it hurt ; he must give not merely the cost of a new coat of paint for the wood trim of the Bienvenu houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes in order to please his mother and her fashionable friends . He must get a stenographer , and study his card-file , and write more letters so as to find customers for paintings . There had been two letters awaiting him at Bienvenu . One from Irma , mailed in Bremen , telling him that she was sailing , and wishing him happiness and success . Not a word about her own feelings ; she was going to let the wound heal by first intention , as the surgeons say ; not reopening or disturbing it . Lanny had lost his wife . He was startled and dismayed every time he realized the fact . And rightp293away he would begin thinking : Could he get her back ? And did he want to ? He would think : " I have affronted her mortally . " He would ask himself : " Am I sorry ? Or would I do it again ? " The answer was sometimes " Yes , " and sometimes " No , " sometimes both . It was confusing , and he could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Trudi with money ? Of course not ! Could he have left her to wander about the streets all night and finally jump into one of the canals ? No , again ! On the other hand , perhaps the error had been in not telling Irma . Frankly and honestly , like a man , not playing the sneak and the cheat . He could hear her saying that , weeping into her pillow on a German steamer . He argued it with her in his mind : " Suppose I had told you , what difference would it have made ? You 'd have refused to go into Germany ; but you 'd have felt wronged , you 'd have been angry . Sooner or later you 'd have realized that you were being made to serve as the tail to the Pink kite , and you 'd have told me not to come home . Is n't that so ? " Irma would have to admit that it was ; and so what difference did it make , really ? What harm had he done by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Nazis would certainly not have arrested her . They might have asked her questions , but she would quickly have made plain that she had been imposed upon . Far from doing her harm , Lanny had got her an interview with Hitler  --  something that would be a feather in her cap for the rest of her life . Especially if she really felt as she had stated in the Berghof ; if she was going to let herself serve as the tail to the Nazi kite ! " It 's the indignity of the thing that I object to "  --  so she would answer in these imaginary debates . He would say : " Tell me this : if I had left you in Shore Acres and gone into Germany , would you have told your mother what I had gone for ? , And would your mother have told your uncles ? And how do you know how far it might have gone ? Can you say it could n't have got into the gossip columns ? Or that it could n't have reached some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glamour girl is in Germany , giving money to the underground movement , trying to help underminethe Fiihrer of the Nazis ! ' How many hours would it have taken to reach Berlin ? How many minutes before the Gestapo got on the job ? " No , no , Irma ! You have to admit that if your husband is going to be a secret agent , he has to be secret . " " But I do n't want that kind of husband , " Irma replies ; " and so good-by and best wishes . " That is going to be her phrase : " I wish you all success . " But will she mean it ? Will she say it also to Hitler and to his agents in New York ? Certainlyshe can not mean both ; for if the Fiihrer of the Nazis gets what he wants , the grandson of Budd 's loses everything that he wants ; and vice versa ! The utility king 's daughter may wish to be polite to both sides in this war , but the time will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other letter was from " Kornmahler , " and it , too , was brief and formal . " Just a line to tell you that I am in Paris , and to say once more how grateful I am for your kindness . I will let you know when I have some sketches to show you , and when I have a permanent address . " To this note also he gave no little thought . Trudi was going to keep her alias , even though she was safe in France ; and what did that mean ? She was going to do some sort of work which German agents in Paris were not to find out about . To manage that , she would have to keep away from other refugees ; at any rate , from all but one or two whom she might trust . Perhaps she would have Lanny as her contact with Germany . Or perhaps she wanted to be free to go back now and then . She might even want him to take her back . Lanny shivered when he thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Whatever Trudi demanded of him , his uncomfortable conscience would compel him to do . She gave him no address . That meant she did n't want him to come until she was ready ; until she had some " sketches "  --  that is , some plan worked out , requiring money or other help . Well , that was what he wanted , was n't it ? Surely he did n't expect to go to Paris and drink coffee with her , or take her to a show , or driving in the Bois ! He was n't expecting to get her some presentable clothes andp295introduce her to his mother 's smart friends ! What had bound him to her was precisely the fact that she was different from the other women he knew . She was that stern daughter of the voice of God whom Wordsworth had sung . She and her friends  --  Lanny thought once more of the line from an old German poem which made him quail : " Wir sired all des Todes Eigen . " We are all death 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrived safely after pleasant trip Frances well and happy good luck to you Irma . " So she was doing the polite thing , as they had agreed . It was her duty to let him know about the child ; but to say that the child was " happy " when her father was absent might be taken as a hint for the father to remain absent . How easy to have said : " Frances is well but misses you " ! If she had said that , what would he have done ? Bought a steamer ticket ? Or sent a cablegram asking : " Would Frances like me to come and see her ? " They were neither of them accustomed to saving cable-tolls , and this message to her husband was perhaps the shortest that Irma Barnes had ever sent . " Pleasant trip , " she remarked ; it was n't economy which kept her from saying : " Pleasant but lonely . " Lanny thought : " She 's really going to end matters ! " He thought : " I wonder if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are the thoughts she does n't write . " Not wishing to be outdone in politeness , he answered : " Hansi and Bess here making music best love to daughter affectionate regards sorry . " He might have said less and he might have said more . He desired to meet her approximately half-way . The musical couple took their departure by steamer from Marseille . They were going to find a home somewhere on the Connecticutshore , near the rest of the family ; also , they were going to have a baby . Mama had written to Bess , pleading for this greatest of all favors ; not the first letter of the sort , but the most importunate . They had been married nine years , and surely , if ever  --  ! Mama pointed out that Freddi was gone , and mentioned that Rahel was interested in a young man who was Papa 's capable assistant . What a good Jewish mother wanted was for her firstborn to have a son , and the most perfect piano accompaniments could not take the place of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefathers ' God as well as Hansi 's . Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house ! Lanny , left alone , had too much time for brooding over his loss ; so he hunted up his old friend and tutor , Jerry Pendleton , who did n't worry overmuch about the state of the world , but played a fast game of tennis and liked to swim and go fishing . His little French wife was running the Pension Flavin in Cannes , and the boarders could as always be depended upon to eat the fish . Lanny entertained his friend by telling about being a boarder in Salzburg ; Jerry in turn told his troubles  --  his wife 's mother had died , and an aunt owned half of the pension and did n't get along very well with her niece . " Hang all women ! " was the ex-tutor 's comment , and Lanny would have assented , only this might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his duty to let his mother and father know about his marital situation . But just how much ? Robbie would be grieved , but probablynot greatly surprised . Robbie knew that he had an erratic son , and would n't expect permanent rationality from him . Lanny was Robbie 's wild oat , and the sins of the fathers were being visited upon the children ; Robbie had paid a lot , and must be prepared to pay more . But Beauty was different . Beauty did n't want to pay for her sin ; Beauty hated to pay any sort of bill whatever . Beauty wanted what she wanted and could n't bear to have it snatched away from her . In short , Beauty was going to raise the very devil , and Lanny kept thinking how he could evade payment of that debt . Should he take a trip around the world , as Hansi and Bess had done ? Or should he go and see Russia , as they had urged ? Perhaps he might suddenly be called to London , the very day that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both parents , telling of his successful business deals in Germany , his meeting with Hansi and Bess , and their visit ; he added : " Irma got lonesome for Frances and decided to sail to New York from Germany . I had to come here on account of somep297of the problems of the school . " He guessed that this would n't fool either the shrewd man or the shrewd woman of the world . Robbie would phone Irma and , learning that the trouble was serious , would go to Shore Acres and get the story . Beauty would begin having fits ; and sure enough , here came a letter by airmail : " Lanny , what does this mean ? Is there something wrong between you and Irma ? Do for God 's sake write me the truth right away , for I am deeply troubled . " The truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God ! Lanny would tell the first and the last , but surely not the middlesection . He wrote : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends and about our purposes . We thought it might be wiser if we stopped arguing for a while . There is nothing for you to worn . about , and please do n't . " Nothing to worry about ! Lanny could imagine his darling mother reading that sentence and bursting into a hysterical laugh . Nothing to worry about in the prospect of losing the brightest star that ever shone in the diadem of a mother-in-law ! Nothing to worry about in losing a hold on twenty-three million dollars  --  to say nothing of a **27;8699;TOOLONG child in which Beauty certainly hadshare ! All that prestige , that glory ! All those beautiful dresses that Irma turned over to her after wearing them only two or three times  --  and that required only some letting out ! All that security against panics and debts  --  look at how Irma had saved Robbie from ruin during the Wall Street crash and how she had helped to set Robbie up in the airplane business ! Nothing to worry about ! Beauty and Marceline were guests of Margy at her country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , dancing , havinga lovely time ; but all that was nothing in the face of impending calamity . Beauty sat down and wrote a telegram : " Must see you at once will come Bienvenu unless you are coming north please wire your plans . " Lanny replied by airmail : " It is foolish of you to try to interfere between Irma and me . Believe me , dear , there is absolutely nothing you can do . I expect to be in Paris soon on business with Zoltan , and after that I 'll run up to see you unless you are soon coming south . P298In the meantime I beg you not to excite yourself . Irma and I are not going to quarrel or make any scandal . She especially charged me to tell you that she would welcome you to Shore Acres at any time , and would give you a house there , as you gave her one . We agreed that we are positively not going to discuss our personal affairs with anyone , so you must forgive me if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we differ as to the things we like to do and the company we like to keep . Unfortunately neither you nor I nor anyone else can change that fact . " So it went , back and forth . Beauty , of course , took not the least stock in the notion that a husband and wife were parting over questions of philosophy . If that had ever happened it was in some part of the earth which Beauty Budd had never visited . She wrote : " Lanny , for God 's sake tell me , is there another man , or is it another woman ? " To this her forever incomprehensible son replied : " There is neither man nor woman  --  unless you count Hitler as a man or the Statue of Liberty as a woman ! " What was a tormented mother to make out of a remark like that ? One morning while Hansi had been practicing in one studio and Lanny and Bess in the other , the British home fleet had been steamingpast the Cap d'Antibes on its way to the Suez Canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the newspapers told about it , and a British neighbor on the Cap was so excited that he chartered a motor-boat and took his family out to watch the spectacle . Afterward he describedit , thrilling with patriotic pride . " The British lion never bluffs ! " he announced , proudly ; and Lanny , thrilled in turn , believedhim and was happier than he had been for a long time . It really did seem unlikely that a huge naval machine would expend all that fuel and human energy for nothing ; and so  --  one of the mad dictators was going to be halted ! Mussolini had begun his glory raid upon Abyssinia , and all through the summer the diplomats had been scurrying from one capital to another , arguing , pleading , threatening , intriguing . The League ofP299Nations had issued its solemn decrees , its committees of mediation and arbitration had labored , but all in vain . II Duce was determined to have his pound of dark meat , and to have the fun of slicing it himself . He had gone right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had trained in his Balilla to sing songs in praise of hatred and violence . In a couple of weeks more the rainy season would be over in Northeast Africa , and then it giorno di gloria would arrive . Lanny Budd would have had a hard time answering the question which of the two dictators he liked least ; but he had known Mussolinisomewhat longer and perhaps that was enough . For a decade and a half this wretched braggart had been murdering or driving into exile the liberty-loving people of his country ; all this year he had been poisoning the air of Europe with his mouthings , so that Lanny had come to feel for him a deep and personal loathing . Stop him ! Stop him now , before it was too late ! If he could get away with this defiance of decency it would turn loose the furies of greed and hate all over Europe ; there would be no more civilization , only a pit in which wild beasts fought and tore one another to pieces . All that was needed was for Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the usurper , bar him from getting oil , and he was helpless , his blatherings would die in his throat . That would mean war , I1 Duce declared ; he stuck out his jaw and his bemedaled chest  --  the Blessed Little Pouter Pigeon , Lanny had named him  --  defying all the world to come and stop him . He boasted of his thousands of planes , whereby he could and would overwhelm the British fleet . Could he do it ? Would he dare try ? Or was it simplyanother of his bluffs ? Men argued about it wherever they met around the shore of that sea which the dictator called the Fascists ' own ; they discussed it in every chancellery and war and navy office . The air weapons were new , and who could be sure what they could do ? Sooner or later the trial would be made and the answer given  --  but each nation rather preferred that some other should afford the test . On the third of October the invasion began . And so there was one question answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Britain mean ? What did Geneva mean ? The latter gave its reply four days later ; the League Council unanimously denounced Italy as the aggressor . Fine ! That looked like business ! The American observer became so excited that he could n't stay at home and play music and read books ; he wanted to be in Paris , where there would be several editions of the newspapers every day , and parades and speeches , and shouts and perhaps riots in the smoke-filled cafes . He wanted to hear what Uncle Jesse would say about the situation ; and Blum and Longuet , and the de Bruynes , and all his other friends . He arranged for his mail to be forwarded , and stepped into his car on a bright autumn morning ; in the evening he arrived in Paris and , in accord with his program of economy , put up at a hotel of moderate price : the same where sixteen years ago his mother had hidden Kurt Meissnerfrom the Surete Generale and so had got herself involved in an eight-year love affair . Lanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he thought he ' had never seen political passions running so high , never such confusionin people 's thinking . To him it was a clear-cut issue between Right and Left , but he found that his Pink and Red friends could n't see it that way . They hated Fascism , but also they hated war , and here their two enemies were lined up on opposite sides . Few Leftists were able to share Lanny 's enthusiasm for the British Home Fleet , and they even questioned the motives of Anthony Eden . Of such hesitationsthe pro-Italian press took full advantage . " Do you want to die for the Negus ? " was their slogan ; and the French worker asked himself : Did he ? Also , if France let Britain drag her into a war to save the water of Lake Tsana for the British Sudan , what would Hitler be doing in the meantime ? They imagined the Fuhrer grinning and rubbing his hands with delight over the prospect of moving into the Rhineland while French armies were busy in the Maritime Alps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all France was on the side of Premier Laval and the other pro-Italian politicians . There was one reason , all-important but rarely mentioned : outright purchase . P301Here was the tragedy of France , the corruption of those organs upon which the public depended for news and ideas . If you came with enough cash in your hands you could hire the insertion not merely of news stories but of editorial opinion in nearly all the papers of Paris , and now the Italian embassy was said to have sixty million francs for the splitting of the Franco-British alliance in this crisis . Utterly sickening to read the slanders and lies in these papers . descending even to the vilest obscenities . The price of it enabled editors and proprietors to buy jewels and furs for their mistresses to display at the opera and in the cabarets . Lanny discovered that whatever people believed they believed with fury ; so it became necessary for him to take himself off and decide once more about his own role . Which way was he going to serve his cause , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds ? Certainly if he followed his present impulses and spoke out to everyone he knew , it would n't be long before the caninepress would be snapping at his heels ; also , he would make himselfpersona non grata to most of his wealthy clients . He had been se happy in the thought of being able to say what he pleased , but now a very short trial convinced him that it would prove a costly luxury for an art expert . Zoltan Kertersi was in Paris , ready to set a useful example to hi younger associate . The genial Hungarian hated violence and tyranny , as every artist and art lover must ; but he kept a bridle upon his tongue . When people expressed political opinions he listened politely . and made some mild remark to the effect that it was too bad that such questions could not be settled without passion and clamor . Somebody had to keep the altar-fires of culture alight , and he chose ' that role and hoped it might not be entirely futile . The passionate ones would look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves gently rebuked ; they wished that they too might dwell upon those heights and breathe that cold pure air . Lanny , always impressible , was impressed ; but when he went of by himself and thought it over , he could n't see how love of art war going to change the fanaticism of Mussolini and Hitler , or of the Balilla and the Jugend they were training . He went out to Les Forets ,  | as always when he came to Paris , and in discussing the existing crisis he made the remark that these two dictators were raising up ten millionlittle demons all of whom would have to be killed . His old friend Emily was horrified , and begged him never to let such words pass his lips again . Lanny thought it over and decided that his words were scientifically exact , but that their utterance was hardly compatible with the role of secret agent . The long-expected letter from Trudi Schultz was forwarded from Bienvenu . She told her patron that she now had some sketches whichwereworthy of his consideration , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could meet him , as previously . The address she gave was a postoffice box in " le treizieme , " a working-class quarter of Paris . He wrote at once , naming a street corner in that neighborhood , and an afternoon two days off , to give her time . He drove there , and it was just as in Berlin  --  except that the mild-looking gendarmewho watched her get into the car had no swastika armband and his interest in the episode was purely sexual . She was wearing the dark-blue dress which Lanny had taken from Irma 's wardrobe , and it was somewhat large for her . She was pale and apparently thinner , and he said : " Look here , Trudi , you have n't been keeping your bargain about the milk . " " I 've been working very hard , " she answered . " The job of fighting Hitler is a long-range one , I 'm afraid . It 's no good wearing yourself out and dying before he does . I took a lot of trouble getting you out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Yes , Lanny . " She was a serious person , and did n't always get his playful American style . " I have something important to show you . Take me to a place where it will be safe for you to stop and read . " " It 's safe anywhere , " he replied . " You 're out of Hitlerland , you . know . " " I thought there might be somebody who knew you . " " Hardly in this part of Paris . " They were passing a dingy factoryP303building with dust-covered windows , and he drew up by the curb . " This looks all right , " he said , and she put into his hands a tiny pamphletabout four inches tall and three inches wide , containing some twenty pages of very light paper with no cover . He read the front page : ABRAHAM LINCOLN : Sein Leben and Seine Ideen and then , at the bottom of the page : Leipzig : Deutscher Nationalsocialistischer KulturbundHe turned to the first page of the text and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great men of history , and his life and teachings might be of interest and service to the German people if they were truly reported and understood . Known as the Great Emancipator , he gave his life to deliver the Negro people of the North American continent from chattel slavery , and to break the political control of the landlord plutocracy over the southern states ; but the party which he founded has been taken over by the financecapitalelements in that land , which use his name and influence to maintain their pseudo-republican rule . Few realize that it was Germanleaders and sturdy German immigrant soldiers who won the victoriesof the northern armies in the American Civil War , and that the emancipation of the black slaves of that land is one of the contributionsof the Teutonic-Aryan race which have been seized upon and perverted by the banker-Bolshevik dictatorship entrenched in New York and Washington . " " Holy smoke ! " said Lanny . " Where did you get this rubbish ? " " Go on , " commanded the other . He obeyed ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : " The North American plutocratic empire is of course not the only government which pretends to serve the popular will while actually serving the interests of a wealthy clique . The Republican party of the United States is not the only case of a party which promises emancipation to the plain people whom Abraham Lincoln loved , and then proceeds to embark upon a course of militant imperialism . This is a danger which has confronted the masses throughout history , and against which they have to be continually alert . Militarism has always been the enemy of culture and true prosperity ; for wealth which is expended to make killing machinery can not be used for constructive purposes . If a man should spend all his resources and labor to make a bicycle , he would some day be able to ride on the roads , but would not be able to sail upon the sea . In the same way , if a nation converts all its iron and steel into rifles , guns , shells , tanks , submarines , and fighting-planes , that nation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , such a nation will be driven automatically to war , because it must use what it has and can not use what it has not . The day will come when its production is at the peak , and then the nation must act or else admit the futility of all its efforts . " Thus it appears that a great gun , a submarine , a fighting-plane is a despot as powerful as any southern slave-owner or overseer with his whip . A staff of highly trained men is required to operate such a weapon , and others to replace them when they are killed ; others to transport it , and to supply it with munitions and fuel ; laborers to supply replacements for damaged parts ; men to build the factories , and yet others to grow the food and make the clothing and boots for all these kinds of workers . Thus for every great implement of modern war you condemn thousands of men to unproductive labor all their lives , and you condemn their children and grandchildren to that interest slavery which the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolish . " Abraham Lincoln was the friend of the common man , and in his debate over the issue of slavery he said : " That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent . It is the eternal struggle between these two principles , right and wrong , throughout the world . They are the two principles which have stood face to face from the beginning of time . The one is the common right of humanity , the other the divine right of kings . It is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself . It is the same spirit that says : " You toil and work and earn bread and I 'll eat it . " '  | " The man who spoke thus founded the Republican party of the United States of America ; but today that party is in the hands of great bankers , industrialists , and landlords . So it is that political parties degenerate ; so the common people give their devotion to a cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many countriestoday are political leaders who have solemnly pledged themselves to the abolishing of monopoly and interest slavery , but those leaders now ride on the backs of the workers , eat their bread , dwell in palaces , dress themselves in fancy uniforms , and ride about in costly motor-cars . Do you not know of such countries and such leaders ? " " I begin to get the idea , " said Lanny . " Very clever ! " " Read it all , if you do n't mind , " replied Trudi . " It is important to me . " She sat in silence while he read a detailed and well-documented indictmentof the Nazi program of ending unemployment by the pilingup of national debt and spending of national surplus upon rearmament . Germany no longer made public its military budget ; but other nations had ways of finding out how it had grown , and automaticallythey were driven to increase their armaments proportionately . So in the end you had a whole continent , in fact a whole world , engaged in a mad race , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . Abraham Lincoln had denounced militarism ; and what a loss to human culture that his party should have been betrayed and should be serving as an agency of the North American plutocracy ! What a tragedy that this great man of the people , this great cause to which the Germans had contributed their labor and their blood , should not be recognized as a German achievementand thus serve the glory of the Teutonic-Aryan race ! At this point Lanny perceived chat he was nearing the end of the pamphlet , and that it was finishing in the orthodox Nazi tone , so that anyone glancing at the last page would get no idea of the dangerous thoughts concealed in the middle section . " Well , what do you think of it ? " asked Trudi , anxiously.  | " It 's built like a bear-trap . Who got it up ? " " I did . " He glanced at her and saw a bit more color in her cheeks . " It seems to me a very neat idea , and it ought to set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it  --  except the beginning and the end , of course . " " What I did was to try to remember all the things you had said on the subject of militarism and its consequences . " " Thanks for the compliment . They are none of them original ideas , but they are sound , and you have put them in simple language which a plain man can understand . " " It 's my first effort at writing , and I tried hard to produce somethingthat you would find worth while . " Lanny started his car . Safer to talk while driving . " Tell me , what have you done with this pamphlet ? " " I had a few copies printed , so that you and others could see the idea . I can change it if you find anything wrong . " " I have n't a single improvement to suggest . " " Well , then , I can have twenty thousand copies printed with the money I managed to save out of what you gave me in Salzburg . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he inquired . She did n't answer , so he put that question off until later . " Have you any plan to get these distributed in Germany ? " " I have several plans . There are thousands of workers who cross the border into Germany every day , and all sorts of goods are being imported . These will be among them . " " It wo n't take the Gestapo long to find out where they came from , Trudi . " " They will come from different places , provided we can raise the money . " " I 'll do my share , " he said . " Tell me , is there such a concern as the Deutscher Nationalsocialistischer Kulturbund ? " " The concern was born and will die with this pamphlet . The next will be of different appearance , and will be printed in Amsterdam or Geneva . " " I see you have cut out a job for yourself . Do you expect to keep from being known as the source ? "  | " For as long as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , and I feel sure that neither will betray me . Unfortunately , I have to expect that the French police will be helping the Germans . " " Surely so long as Laval is Premier of France , " he commented . " Even longer , Lanny . The police do not change when a governmentchanges . The police serve the two hundred families . " Lanny was driving toward Versailles , and he commented : " This is the road where the market women marched out on a rainy day and dragged the King and Queen back to Paris . It was n't so well paved in those days , or so lined with houses , and Marie Antoinette would hardly know it . Did you ever read the story of Count Fersen , the young Swedish nobleman who was her lover and who accompanied her on this march of doom ? " " I only know what was in the school-books , " she replied . " They do n't mention lovers . " " For my memory this route is lined with cuirassiers in brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They used to travel back and forth to conferences , and we subordinates speculated eagerly as to what was going on underneath the hats . Most of us were disappointed , for it turned out that PresidentWilson had been studying theology when he should have studied economics . " " The treaty was bad , " assented Trudi , " but not half so bad as Hitler represents . " " On the day when it was signed , " Lanny continued , " I was under custody in the old Conciergerie in Paris , and I heard the guns and knew what they meant . Afterwards my friends described the scene . Did you ever see the great Salle des Glaces ? " " I have never been here before . " " It 's a sight that no tourist misses . May I take you ? " " Oh , Lanny ! We must not dare ! " " I assure you , no one will pay the least attention to us . Hundreds of Americans go out there on bright sunny days like this . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If so , what ? I am with a respectable-looking young lady , showingher the sights . She might be the daughter of one of my mother 's sisters whom she left behind her in New England , close to forty years ago . " " It would start the gossips , Lanny ! " " There is no way to stop them , since my wife has removed to New York . " " She really went ? " " She did , and has sent me a polite cablegram wishing me success in life . " " Oh , Lanny , I am so bitterly sorry to have been the cause of that misfortune ! " " Let me tell you a little story  --  what happened in the Berghof while you were sitting out in the car and no doubt finding it a long wait . " " The time did seem long , I admit . " " It was somewhat less than two hours ; and for a full hour Hitler made us a speech  --  just such a speech as millions of Germans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty of being sent to a concentration camp . He gave us the whole story that he told first in 1919 and has stuck to ever since : the wicked Versailles Diktat and the treachery of the Allies under the inspiration of the **25;8728;TOOLONG . You know it only too well , I am sure . " " Ach leider ! " " Well , Irma listened to it for a solid hour ; and when he had finishedshe stepped forward and told him : I want you to know that I agree with every word you have said . ' " " Oh , Lanny , how dreadful ! " " You understand , she did n't have to say that . Nobody asked her . It was her own spontaneous act . " " But was n't it because of her anger with us ? " " No doubt that caused her to speak , but it did n't determine what she said . The reason I gave up and let her go was that later , in Salzburg , she gave me her terms for the future : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Communists and Communism , or with Socialists and Socialism . Considering that my half-sister and her husband and also my uncle are Communists , and that several of my oldest friends are Socialists , she would hardly have expected me to say yes . " " You 're not going back to her , then ? " " I 'm going to see my little daughter , and I suppose I 'll meet Irma ; but I do n't expect to reopen the subject , and I doubt if she would let me . We 've agreed not to make a scandal . What concerns you especially , she has promised not to talk about you . " " Do you think she will keep the promise ? " " She is getting all that she asked for , and she is n't a vindictive person . She offered me money , provided I would n't spend it on Socialism ; but of course that 's the only thing I would take it for , and she knows that . " " Do n't you feel rather desolate ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many people we know . There just is n't any use expecting one 's life to be perfect in a time like this . " They wandered through the beautiful park of Versailles , once the playground of the Grand Monarque and his successors , and for a long time one of the world 's tourist attractions . In the Petit Trianon they inspected the chapel in which Marie Antoinette had prayed and the harpsichord upon which she had played accompaniments for Fersen 's flute . They strolled about the grounds , observing the Belvidere and the Orangerie , the Jeu de Bague and the Temple d'Amour . At the garden front Lannv remarked : " There is a report widely current that if you come here on the tenth of August , and happen to be what is called psychic , you may see Marie Antoinette sitting outside here , wearing a wide flapping hat and a pink dress ; also you will see many of the people of her time , moving about the place in costume . " Trudi smiled and replied : " Perhaps there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tenth of August is the date of the sacking of the Tuileries in Paris , which was , of course , a dreadful experience for poor Toinette . Perhaps she comes here to escape the painful memories . " Farther on was the little lake and stream , and at one of the rustic bridges Lanny stopped . " Here is a spot which played a part in an experience which you may take as a ghost story , not trying to believe it . In my library is a volume called An Adventure , written by two respectable English ladies , college-teachers and daughters of clergymen , who came here at the beginning of the century and strolled about these grounds , moved by idle curiosity like you and me . It happened to be the tenth of August , though that date meant nothing to them . They had never been interested in psychic matters and had no idea of what was coming . They had what I suppose one might call a collective hallucination ; they saw the people of the ancien regime and were spoken to by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what it meant ; only afterwards , when they began to compare notes , they realized that one had seen things which the other was certain had not been there . They began looking up old data and discovered that they had seen the grounds as they had been a century and a half earlier , but were not at the time of their visit . " " You take that sort of thing seriously , do n't you , Lanny ? " " Much against my inclinations , I have been forced to . It has occurredto me as a possibility that time may not be the fixed and permanent system which it seems to us , but may be a product of our own minds , a form which we impose upon our experiences . " Trudi had no comment , and they strolled on . Presently Lanny remarked : " You asked me if I could manage to get you a seance with our Polish medium . " " Oh , yes , " she replied . " Is she still with you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would n't do to take you there , but I could bring Madame to some hotel and have her take a room , and then bring you to her . It would be better if I were not present , because I have managed to get her spirit control ' irritated with me because of my skeptical questions . You see , I please neither side ; the Marxists think I am a fool and a dupe and the spirits think I am irreverent . "   " I 'll try to be open-minded , " said this Marxist ; " but I ca n't promise to be convinced . " " I would be foolish indeed to ask such a promise . All that you must agree to is to accept my word that I shall not give Madame the faintest hint about your identity . " " I 'll certainly believe that , Lanny . " " Also , " he added , " I 'm hoping that you 'll let me see something of you when I happen to be in Paris . I 'm quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily make sure about yourself . We can meet at that corner as we did today , and I can drive you to some different part of France where nobody will have the slightest interest in us . You ca n't work all the time , and if you try to , your work will suffer . At least I can do what I 'm hoping to do this evening , find some quiet auberge and see that you get one substantial meal . Will your conscience permit that much self-indulgence ? " " Lanny , " she said , " I 'm not an ascetic ; it 's just that when I think of what is happening to our comrades , my food chokes me . " " I know , my dear ; I 've had the feeling many a time . But here we are , in this old tormented Europe , and there 's never been an hour since I was born when I could n't have starved myself for that reason . I suddenly became aware of it at the end of July 1914 . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy that would permit me to eat and sleep and even play music . Cruelty and suffering are n't going to be ended in our lifetime , and it 's the part of wisdom to make a rule never to expend more energy in one day than you can restore in one night . So now let us go and find our auberge , and I 'll tell you how you have to behave with Madame Zyszynski if you hope to get my significant results . " P312BE A U T Y B U D D could n't stand the suspense any longer . She telegraphed that she was coming , and next morning here she was ; putting up at her son 's hotel , full of strange memories for her , and hardly stopping to take off hat and coat before going to work on him . " Now , Lanny , do for God 's sake tell me what has happened ! " He had rehearsed this scene in his mind ; knowing her so thoroughly , he had been able to say everything for her as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her that he and Irma had been discovering how they were irritated by each other 's opinionsand bored by each other 's friends ; they had finally decided there was no sense standing it . " Tell me this , " she persisted , " just what did you do to Irma in Germany ? " " Nothing different from anywhere else . It 's the same old story . I wanted to meet my friends there --  " " Men friends or women ? " He had anticipated this , and prepared a humorous reply . " There have to be both , in order that there may be more . " " Do n't be silly . I ca n't believe that Irma is interested in any other man ; I know it must be some woman , somewhere . Tell me , is it that young German artist whose work you were so interested in ? " He was surprised by this ; he had n't imagined that she was keeping a notebook on his doings . But Beauty Budd was like that . Nobody was going co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sketches , any more than in any woman 's poetry or music or ideas or whatever it might be . Women existed for onep313purpose so far as men were concerned , and every woman knew it in her heart , no matter how hard she might try to fool herself . Lanny had to make up his mind in a small fraction of a second . He said , rather severely : " I 'm sorry , dear . If you want to take that line , I 'm not going to discuss it . I think you might leave it to somebody else to start the scandals on us . " Tears began creeping into her eyes , as he knew they would sooner or later . She would have to have a good cry before this was over , and it was better while they were alone and she did n't have to worry about her makeup . " I know how bitterly disappointing it must be to you , " he continued , more gently . " You just . have to make up your mind that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irma and I know our own minds , and we 've taken the trouble to think it out thoroughly . She is going to live at Shore Acres , and I 'm going to live here and there , as in the past . We 've agreed that we 're not going to have any sort of fuss , and in this I expect to receive the co-operation of my mother . When people ask about it , just say that she seems to like Long Island and I seem to like Europe , and that 's that . " " Lanny , there 'll be some other man , and you 'll lose her . " " I hope that whoever he is , he 'll be able to make her happy . I have made up my mind that there is small possibility of happiness in love where people differ in their fundamental beliefs as completelyas Irma and I do . " " You 're definitely giving her up , then ? " " It was she who gave me up , and I 'm accepting her decision because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to see her again ? " " I shall probably see her , because she is the mother of my child , and I certainly do n't intend to give up the child . " " And what about my grandchild ? " " Irma has been your friend and there is no reason why she should cease to be . Go there whenever you want to , and she will treat you as you treated her when she was your guest . The place is huge , and nobody need he in any other 's way . Play bridge with Fanny Barnes , and do n't object if she cheats you a little ; Irma will make it up with a handsome check now and then , and everything will be jake . " Poor soul ! She tried to lecture her son on the holy bonds of matrimony , but it was rather late in both their lives ; he soon kidded her out of it and forced her to talk about facts . It would be , she argued , a perfectly frightful blow to the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right now , of all times ; such a cruel thing to do to a young girl just ready for the marriage market ! Beauty had been planning , with the abettal of Emily and her other smart friends , - to give her a grand debut at Bienvenu at the beginning of the season in January . But now , of course , it would be a farce . Nothing could save them socially ; they would be plunged from the top of the scale to third-rate or lower . " Listen , old girl , " he said , " be sensible and write Irma a nice letter . Tell her how sorry you are and that you want to be friends . Explain how a scandal will hurt Marccline 's chances , and suggest that she give her a party at Shore Acres to show that everything is all right . Irma will understand without your dotting the i 's and crossing the t 's , and I 'm sure she 'll be glad to do it . " " But , Lanny , I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry here and live at Bienvenu , so that I wo n't be so lonely . " " Has she definitely broken with Alfy ? " " They quarrel half the time , and spend the other half making up . It seems to me it would be a very silly match , because Alfy has to spend the next four years in college , and he has no income . Marcelinewill be eighteen this month , and she ought to marry some older man who can give her what she needs now . " " What you have taught her to need , " he was tempted to say ; but that would have been unkind  --  and useless , since he could n't change his half-sister . " Listen , Beauty , " he said , " we have to take what we can get in this world and no good crying for the moon . It seems to me your husband is the person to give you advice at this stage in your life . You have talked about spirituality , andp315what 's the matter with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Lanny , " she wept , " what 's the good of your telling me such things ? You know you do n't believe a word of them . " " That shows how little you understand your son , " he replied . " Parsifal knows better , I am sure . He has his faith and I have mine and each of us works at it . I do n't think that to stop wage-slavery and war , to stop human beings from robbing and killing one another , is exactly a trivial ideal , either in your sight or in that of your Creator . Incidentally , I think my mother has been a very wellpreservedlady all her life . You have a lot to be grateful for , and it 's the part of wisdom to learn to be happy with it instead of tormenting yourself because you 're losing things that you really have n't any use for . " That stern talk frightened her a little , and she tried to dry her eyes . " Lanny , I 'm only thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is so , understand where my happiness lies . I 'm not entirely joyful over losing the wife I love ; but I have my faith that I live by , and I do n't intend to give it up in order to he kept in a palace and be stared at as a Prince Fortunatus . " " Lanny , you do such dreadful things , and frighten us women half out of our wits . " " I 'm sorry about that , dear ; but I did n't make the profit system and I did n't make war . " She was staring at him through her tears , which would n't stop coming . " Lanny , " she burst out , suddenly , " you have n't really been making love to any other woman , have you ? " " Indeed I have not . " " And Irma knows that you have n't ? " " She knows it well . " " Then I 'll tell you what I really think . She 's a cold-hearted and selfish woman , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help laughing . " Well , darling , do n't take it as your duty to tell her . It is no part of my plan to turn you into a social uplifter . Just remember that Irma is the mother of your granddaughter , and that , right or wrong , she 's the boss So . whatever happens , keep on friendly terms with her . "   " When are you going to see her ? " " I have n't any definite plans . " " You 're not going to ask her to come back to you ? " " Not on her terms . How can I ? " " Remember her pride , Lanny , and give her a little the best of it . Women nearly always get the worst , you know . " " I 'll tell her I 'm sorry , of course . I said it in a cable , but she did n't see fit to take note of it . " " Do n't wait too long , dear . Remember what swarms of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother out to Les Forks , so that she might talk things over with Emily , and find out if Emily had managed to worm any more out of him than his mother had . ( She had n't . ) When Lanny got back to his hotel there was a cablegram from Robbie , saying that he was sailing that night for Cherbourg , and Lanny wondered if that was a conspiracy with his mother , or an overture from his wife , or both , or neither . It was possible , of course , that Robbie was coming on business ; he had got his factory going , and his planes were diving and swooping over the field he had built by the banks of the Newcastle River . They were equaling the promisedperformances , and Robbie was exulting , but also fuming because of the red tape of the bureaucrats and the dumbness of the brass-hats . What did they imagine a fabricating-plant was going to do with its time and labor while they were fussing over commas in contracts and insisting that demonstrations already made should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things like that ever since Lanny had known him . And now it was to be expected that he would be coming to try the French markets , makinguse of his personal influence and that of his stockholders in France . Especially in view of the new crisis , and the possibility that Mussolini might really have the air superiority of which he was boasting . Meeting Robbie would n't be such a strain as meeting Beauty , forP317Robbie was a sensible man and ideas counted with him as they never could with his one-time arnie . Moreover , Robbie would have had a talk with Irma , and Lanny was curious to hear about that . While waiting , he talked picture business with Zoltan , and they looked at masters old and new and wrote letters to clients . Lanny decided to go shares with Zoltan on the rest of the Goring collection , for Zoltan had many clients of his own and could work at art while Lanny was working at changing the world . He decided to get the meeting with Zyszynski out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call for her in the mid-morning two days later . Then he wrote a note to " Kornmahler , " telling her that the medium would be at a certain cheap hotel in " le treizierne " at a certain hour . Lanny would wait in his car across the street from the hotel and would instruct Madame that after the seance she was to go and get her lunch and attend a cinema , thus giving Trudi time to join Lanny and report results . So Lanny motored into Seine-et-Oise on a rainy and chilly Novembermorning and picked up the old woman  --  incidentally being told by the butler that the master would be pleased to see him on his return . Poor old Knight Commander , sitting there in his castle waiting for the grim reaper to come and cut him down , and dreaming meanwhileof the woman he had loved and trusted ; yearning for any word about her , any faintest perfume of her presence ! Come and tell me what happens at the seance , Lanny ! On the way into Paris that dull old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fancy . With other people she was content to be silent , but to him she talked about the Hindu servants and what strange men they were and how hard to talk to . She told about her childhood in Poland , where she had lived in a peasant hut and had once raised a calf which her parents had given to her ; she had called it Kooba , and everything about it was as real and dear to her as Zaharoff 's duquesa to him . If somebody had told her that Tecumseh had brought a message from the spirit Kooba , nothing would have brought the old woman more happiness . Lanny told her how she was to spend her day , and gave her money to pay for her hotel room , also a pack of cards so that she could play Patience in case the visitor might be late . The visitor 's name was Mademoiselle Kornmahler , and Lanny had already instructed her how to behave : to speak no unnecessary word until the medium was in her trance , and after that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his questions promptly and truthfully , but tell him no more than necessary ; to wait until Madame was out of her trance before moving , and then to thank her politely , tell her that all had gone well , and leave without unnecessary conversation . He deposited his charge and parked across the street a little way down the block . He sat and read some of Richet 's Thirty Years of Psychical Research , which he was going to lend to Trudi . He never minded waiting , because he always had something to read in his car . After an hour or more , Trudi appeared suddenly and slid into the seat beside him ; he dropped the book , started the engine , and said : " Well , how was it ? " " I did n't hear from Ludi , " were her first words . " Too bad ! " he replied . " That 's the way it goes . " " But I heard many other things . Lanny , it is a most uncanny ex-perience ! " " You bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first he said there was my mother . She was tall , had gray hair , and wore black ; that is all true , because my father was killed in the war . But you see , Lanny , I am fairly tall , and so it is reasonableto guess that my mother might have been . " " Did she give her name ? " " Tecumseh said it sounded like Greta . She was called Gretchen . " " A very common name , " commented Lanny , who knew how to deal with newcomers to this strange field ; " so you might call that a guess , too . Did she give any message ? " " She wanted me to know that she was well and happy . Of course I 'd be much pleased to know that my mother is well and happy anywhere  --  if I knew it was my mother . "   " And then what ? " " Then a strange thing : I was told that there was a large , heavy-set man who said his name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that name ; but it was n't he . He said he had a message for Otto , but I did n't know any Otto . " " What was the message ? " " I was to tell him that Gregor was working with him , and that the despot would be overthrown in time  --  but a long time . " " That did n't mean anything to you ? " " I thought of Gregor Strasser and his brother , who founded the Black Front against Hitler . You know about them , no doubt . " " I once came very close to Gregor . I was in the room with him when Hitler gave him a fearful dressing down in Hitler 's apartment in Berlin . I had such a good chance to study him that I 've always felt I knew him . Also I heard him make a speech at a Versamrlung in Stuttgart . When he was murdered in the blood purge I was in Stadelheim Prison , and afterwards I got a message about it  --  but that was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind , perhaps the message was meant for me . " " Do you know where Otto is ? " " I have n't an idea , though I 've heard he is somewhere in Europe , working against the Nazis . For my part I would n't be interested , for I would n't trust any man who had ever been one of them . " " I agree with you , " said Trudi . " But it is extraordinary that this old woman should know about the Strassers . " " She does n't , " declared Lanny . " I 'd wager all I own on that . She has no mind for any political affairs . While I was driving her here she told me all about a calf she raised as a child ; what the calf ate , the noises it made , and the strange feeling she had when she dipped her fingers in a pail of milk and let the calf suck them . . . . Go on ; what else ? " " There was an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunts all my seances . He was very angry now , I suppose . " " He was ; he said he wished you to know that you are breaking the laws of man as well as of God . He commands you to return to your wife . "   " I do n't know any law that obliges me to live with my wife when she wo n't have me . You see , the old gentleman wanted Irma and me to have babies , and he cross-examined us about it in plain biblical language before he died . " " Do you think it is really your grandfather now , Lanny ? " " I do n't know what the devil it is . I know that Zyszynski does n't know anything about my grandfather , and nothing about my being parted from Irma , because she 's been at Balincourt for several months . Anybody else ? " " There was a Lady somebody  --  Ladybird ? " " That is quite cute , " said Lanny . " I 'm sorry I never thought of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Birdie . " " That is the name . " " She comes frequently . She talks to Zaharoff , and tells him she is in heaven . " " There was a message for Zaharoff , from his wife . She is watching and waiting for him , and he will come soon . That is not such a pleasant message , is it ? " " It will be for him . He would go gladly if he were sure that she was there . He has little reason to love this world , so far as I know his life . " That completed the list of the spirit visitors  --  a strange assortment . Lanny took his friend back over the various episodes and she added details under his questioning . He wished he might have been there , taking notes . " Madame knows that you are associated with me , " he said ; " so that might account for the messages to me and about me . But it does n't account for her knowing that Irma and I are separated , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , " countered Trudi , " suppose we call it spirits , did Gregor Strasser know who you were when he got his scolding from Hitler ? " " It is possible that he may have asked someone of the household about the strange young man who had witnessed his humiliation ; or again , it might be that spirits know more than they knew whenp321they were people . But what my mind always comes back to is the idea of telepathy . There was nothing in any of these communications which was n't in either your mind or mine . " She reflected . " It might be hard to say how there could be a communicationwhich might n't have been known to somebody . " " Quite so . Take the famous case of Glastonbury Abbey , which is in the psychic research books ; the communicators were supposed to be long-dead monks , and they told secrets about the architecture of the long-buried ruins . Excavations proved the statements correct . But who can be sure there may not exist some records of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be studying them at the time ? " " Has anybody ever succeeded in working out an answer to that ? " " It can be done with what you might call artificial facts . Suppose , for example , I cut a small slot in a piece of paper , and thrust that paper between the pages of a book at random . It is obvious that when I open the book , certain words or letters will be visible through the slot ; but until the book is opened , nobody knows what those words or letters are . Now seal up the book and lock it in a safe , and let people in New York and Australia consult mediums and see if they can find out what will show through the slot . " " Has anything like that ever been done ? " " The records of the British Society for Psychical Research are full of all kinds of experiments along that line ; but the trouble is , nobody except members of the society ever reads them . The average scientist just knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that settles it . If you find that it does happen , right away you becomea crank like the others , and your testimony has no value . " He turned Trudi loose on the street with the Richet book under her arm , and drove to the hotel and took Madame back to the chateau . It was n't often that Zaharoff asked to see anyone , but he had asked for Lanny Budd , and so the art expert went into the library with the big blazing fire and told the retired munitions king ofp322Europe that another message had come from the duquesa , given to a woman friend whom Lanny did not name . He could have made a hit with the old man by bringing or sending such messages frequently ; but he played the game honestly , and wondered if Sir Basil appreciated the fact . Probably he trusted Lanny as much as he trusted anybody in the world . He could never get away from the thought that this agile-minded young American was the son of a business man , and must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody knew this game better than the Knight Commander , and when others tried it on him he watched with a sad heart . There he sat , warming his aching old bones by a fire of wood from his grand old forests ; keeping his false teeth clamped firmly together , so that the visitor might not see or hear the shaking of his jaw ; keeping his hands firmly upon his knees so that the visitor might not see their trembling . In those old hands he still held a vast fortune , the extentof it known only to himself . Dominant in his mind was the certainty that these hands were soon going to fall lifeless , and the fortune be left for others to dissipate . This castle had once belonged to a very old king with a white beard like Zaharoff 's ; then it had belonged to the king 's mistress , whom he had followed on the street and bought through an agent like any other objet d'art . Who would live in it next , and sit before the fire and tell tales about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired the mastery of most of the great munitionsplants of Europe and had sold impartially to all nations the means of mutual suicide ? Would the Greek know what they were saving about him ? Lies , mostly  --  but the truth had been worse , if they had known it ! Would it trouble him what they said ? Would he tremble inside , and feel his blood pressure mount , as happened now whenever he came upon the most harmless item about himself in that press of Paris which he had bought so freely in the past ? Or would he be sitting in some lovely garden , looking at the duquesa 's tulips , knowing the different varieties and observing nature 's odd incalculable whims ? Here came this smooth-spoken young man who had known thep323duquesa and admired her , spoke of her kindly , and brought rare messages from her ; what did that mean ? Impossible to believe that he really cared for a slowly dying old man ! Was he really interested in psychic research ? Or was he merely helping his father to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , who ever has enough money ? Was he perchance wondering if an old friend would remember him in his will ? That is the supreme tragedy of the aged rich . Who ever comes near them that is not thinking that ghoulish thought ? Who could tolerate their infirmities , their indecencies , except that he or she is taking a gambler 's chance at a fortune  --  thecheapest and easiest chance ? To hell with you , hyenas all , you sha n't have a sou of it ! The march into Abyssinia continued , and the diplomatic duel went on in the secret chambers . Lanny had been buoyed up with hope , but not for long after he got to Paris , for all the " insiders " agreed that nobody was going to call Il Duce 's bluff . The League had imposed " sanctions " of a very mild character  --  not enough to stop the Italians , just enough to infuriate them and cause them to burn Anthony Eden in effigy . The British tried to lay the blame on the French refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , who had known as early as September that the British were unwilling to close the Suez Canal or to shut off the oil supplies , the only two measures which might have been effective . So Denis de Bruyne told Lanny , having got it direct from Pierre Laval . Recriminations everywhere the diplomats met ; Rick called it a thieves ' kitchen . They were all imperialists , he declared , all in a squabble over dividing the loot . British general elections were due in a few days , and Rick was campaigning against the government candidates , so he could only write briefly . " The Tories have to pretend to support the League ; and the day after the elections they will cut the League 's throat . They are even allowing the Italians to carry poison gas through the Suez ; gas so declared for transit fees , mind vou ! "  | There was that magnificent fleet waiting at Alexandria ; two , in fact , the home fleet and the Mediterranean . In Lanny 's ears rang the proud boast : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statesmen were shivering at the thought of a mad dictator sending his bombing-planes , his submarines and swarms of tiny sea-sledges on some dark night , and next morning there would be no British lion . There were even rumors that the fleet had been sent without sufficientammunition  --  and how could you know what to believe ? In the midst of this long-drawn-out crisis Robbie Budd and his right hand , Johannes Robin , arrived in Paris . It was harvest time for them ; Robbie , having foreseen it , had his harvesting-machinery well greased and its engines warmed . He had shipped one of his new fighter planes , the Budd-Erling   , on board a freighter , and with it came a crew ready to uncrate and assemble it ; also a test-pilot who was going to put the marvel through its paces for the French government , and fly it to England and repeat the performance . The French were a penurious people , Robbie said , and would hate like sin to pay cash for planes which they might hope to reproduce in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't use what you might have next year , but what you had today . Robbie carried a threat to every war office , that if they did n't get the Budd-Erling   the next country would . A man of great affairs could n't afford to put up at the second-class hotel where Lanny and Beauty were staying . He and his man Friday had to be at the Crillon , and the mother and son came over to lunch with them and found them so full of business that they hardly had time to tell the news from home . Robbie was n't going to waste time with subordinates , but ask de Bruyne to bring him together with the French Premier . Beauty said : " I think I could arrange it so that you would meet him socially . " She explained that at one of Irma 's receptions she had met a titled French lady who was the mistress of one of Laval 's closest associates ; she offered to see this lady and arrange to have her give a dinner at her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the French governmentand have a chance to talk to them while they were feeling mellow.  | " What will she expect ? " Robbie asked , and Beauty said : " Not very much , I should think ; say , five thousand francs . " " All right , " said the man of affairs . " See what you can do ; but I 'll have to know today , because this crisis may soon be over . " It was like the old days which Lanny remembered so vividly , when the World War had hit them and he had to become his father 's secretary at the age of fourteen . Now Robbie had brought a secretary with him , one who knew French well . Lanny sat and watched the master of affairs read cablegrams , dictate answers , and talk over the phone with important persons . It was late in the afternoon before he said : " Now , son , we 'll have time for ourselves . How about a bit of fresh air ? " " Fine ! " replied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you 're equal to it , " said the father  --  joking , for he was trying to take off weight and not succeeding any too well . They strolled on the great Place de la Concorde , where Lanny had seen the soldiers bivouacked in war days , the captured German cannon parked in peace-making days , and mobs , Communist or Fascist , combatingthe gendarmes on several occasions . The hotel suite which had been assigned to his father was the one on whose balcony a maidservant had been shot while watching the rioting less than two years ago . The bitterness of that night of battle was still poisoning the public life of France . " Well , son , " began Robbie , " I 've had several talks with Irma , and I need n't say what a sad affair it seems to me . " " She told you the whole story ? " " She says she did ; but of course I want to hear your side . " " I really have n't much of a side , Robbie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes her unhappy ; she wants me to give up my ideas , and I ca n't . That 's about all there is to it . " " Your ideas mean more to you than your wife and child ? " " They mean more to me than anything else , including life . " " That 's serious talk , Lanny . You must realize that going up againstp326a bunch of people like the Nazis is no child 's play , and it does n't leave a man 's wife much chance of happiness . " " I realize that fully , and I 'm not blaming Irma , either publicly or in my heart . It 's just her hard luck that she did n't realize what she was taking on . I explained it to her before I asked her to marry me , but she was young and it just did n't register . " " Do you still love her ? " " Of course I love her ; but how can there be love when there is no harmony of mind ? I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her still more unhappy in the future . So what 's the use of fooling with it ? " " You 're not going to make any attempt at a reconciliation ? " " How can I , when she laid down the law to me that I had to break with all my friends ? " " She was angry when she said that , and I do n't think she would expect to stand by it literally . " " Did she tell you that ? " " She said as much . " " Well , why does n't she say it to me ? " " She told me she had written to you . " " Yes , but nothing like that . She wrote the news about Frances and assured me that she wished me all happiness . " " I think you ought to go and see her , Lanny , and talk the thing out fairly and frankly . " " I know , that sounds reasonable , but it 's because you do n't realize how much talking we 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that I really care about . You know how it is with you and me  --  we argue , but you have a sense of humor , and we kid each other and manage to get along . But Irma has no humor , at least not where her intellectual prestige is concerned ; she thinks I think she 's dumb about politics and economics , and I do , and so she gets her feelings hurt , and I ca n't help it . It 's just a damn bore , not being able to say what you think and have the other fellow stand the gaff . Take Uncle Jesse ; I can fight with him and he gives me as good as he gets and that 's the end of it . But with Irma  --  good Lord , it 's like running a newspaper under censorship . I have to accumulatep327a long list of topics I must never mention in her presence ; I have to bite my tongue off a dozen times a day . I ca n't tell you what a relief it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody and not feel that I 've committed a crime . " Robbie was a tactful man , and had known this unusual son for a long time . " I think you ought to go , Lanny , " he said . " You do n't want Frances to forget you entirely . " " Of course not . I 'm planning to see Frances before long ; but I do n't see what Irma and I can say that we have n't said too many times already . " Robbie wanted to know about the international situation , so urgently important to him , and Lanny told him what he had been able to pick up in Paris . The barefooted black soldiers of the Negus were putting up a tough fight for their freedom , and some of Lanny 's Leftist friends were cherishing the hope that in their wild mountainous country they might be able to wear down the invaders . Robbie said : " Poor niggers , they do n't realize what has happened since the time of Adowa . Believe me , son , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that loses command of the air might just as well quit and save what it can . " Lanny had heard his father make confident assertions about public events , and his score was far from perfect . " You have something to sell ! " he answered , with a grin , and the father replied : " You bet your bottom dollar ! " Robbie was still more confident after he had had his dinner with the fripon mongol and other key Frenchmen . He told his son that the Abyssinian goose was already cooked and ready for carving . " Britain and France are going to compromise , " he declared . " They understand clearly that they ca n't afford to see Mussolini licked . It would be a defeat for the white race ; there 'd be a revolution in Italy , and the Communists would take over the country . " There it was again : Fascism as a bulwark against the Reds ! A Communist revolution would be a calamity , while a Fascist counter- revolution might be a necessity ! Robbie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they would rather turn the politicians out . Lanny had heard it before and knew it was the regularFascist talk . Who could say if it was true ? He did n't want to argue with his father any more than with his wife . It was his role to ask questions and get information to be passed on to his Pink friends . So now he learned that while the League members in Geneva were being stalled in their program of applying sanctions to oil , the French Premier and the British ForeignSecretary were working out a plan to give Mussolini most of what he was out to grab . The prospect disturbed an American merchant of death and he remarked : " I have to get busy and get some contracts signed before this whole thing blows over ! " They went out to the Villacoublay flying-field just south of Paris to witness the tests of the Budd-Erling   . Robbie went in a fancy staff car with magnificoes wearing loads of gold braid , and Lanny drove his mother , also the titled French lady who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for a dinner . A fascinating and at the same time a terrifying thing to watch that man-made bird wheeling and darting in the sky , more rapidly than any creature had ever moved on land , sea , or air up to that moment . To see it mount out of sight , and then come rushing down with the throttle wide open and the motor roaring  --  down , down , until you caught your breath , certain that it must be too late and that the man inside must be dead ; leveling off at the very last instant and sweeping like a hurricane across the field . The test-pilot was helped out of the plane with blood running from his mouth and nose , and it was rather horrible , but it was war . The American Navy had invented this new method of attack , and it was said that the Germans and Italians had both taken it up and were going to win wars with it . " Is France going to lose wars without it ? " asked the president of Budd-Erling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris and set out for London ; Beauty went along to help with her social arts , and Lanny motored them  --  it was like a family reunion . Lanny wanted to see Rick and tell him about Irma , also to consult with him as to what a grown-up playboy might do to keep the Nazi-Fascists from getting control of Europe . He stayed a weekend at The Reaches , and it was like being at home . He had spent so many of his happiest hours here , and this leftist writer represented the wisest and sanest influence in his life . Rick had just been through a hard spell of electioneering ; it had meant traveling here and there addressing audiences , for the most part of working people in obscure halls . Rick had poured his soul into the task of making them realize the need of scotching the Fascist serpent before it had grown to man-killing size . It had been an unpaid , and as the event proved , a futile labor . Because of the division among the opposition forces , the Tories had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total votes , and so the betrayalof the people 's hopes would go on . Rick 's face was lined , and his hair was showing traces of premature gray at the sides ; he took the election results as a personal tragedy , and suffered calamities which had not yet befallen but which his clear mind saw on the way . They strolled outside in the garden , and Lanny told the news he had gathered in Paris , of the secret negotiations between Laval and the British Foreign Secretary , Sir Samuel Hoare . Rick said his father had heard rumors of the deal , supposed to be the gravest of state secrets ; now he learned just which provinces the " poor niggers " were going to surrender to I1 Duce , and how the rest were to be governed by an Italian " adviser . " Rick said : " That 's the damnedest sell-out of public opinion in the history of this country ! " When he learned how sure Lanny was of having it right , he added : " How would it do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Exactly what I was hoping , " replied the American . The playboy thought for a while and said : " I met a New York journalist the other day ; if the story came from there it could never be traced to you .   Suppose I ride up to town with you in the morning and attend to it ? " Lanny told about his domestic problem . The advice he got would n't have pleased his father and mother , for Rick had never liked the match and had been afraid that it would cost him a friend . He said that a fortune such as Irma Barnes 's represented an accumulation of social crimes and was a corrupting force which very few could withstand , certainly not an amiable and pliable art lover . He said : " Stay away from Irma till the wound has healed ; let her find another man , or you find another woman , somebody who believes what you believe and will encourage what you want to do . " Lanny 's mind told him that this was wise advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend added : " I would n't be surprised if she hit it off with Ceddy Wickthorpe . It would be an admirable match from the point of view of both of them . " The code of the smart intellectuals required Lanny to take this lightly . " My mother has been trying to hint that to me for a year or two , " he remarked . " Have you seen any signs of it ? " " They would n't let you see any signs , " declared Rick ; " but you can trust Beauty 's insight in matters of that sort . Ceddy is having the devil 's own time to keep going in the face of rising taxes , and the Barnes fortune would be a windfall to him . Irma would modernize the castle and make the grandest countess in the realm . Your job might be to persuade Augustus John or Gerald Brockhurst to paint her portrait . " " I have thought of both , " said Lanny , with a smile . " But are they quite up to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as for her ennoblement , just keep out of the way and leave it to economic determinism ! " The anti-Nazi conspirator was n't at liberty to give any hint concerning his associate in Paris . All he said was : " I am doing something for the cause which I 'm pledged not to mention ; but I want you to know that I 'm not just playing round . " " Good for you , old top ! " replied the Englishman . He put his arm about Lanny and gave him a squeeze , a form of demonstration he did not often permit himself . P331Lanny went back to London and appeared in the smart world with his smart mother . This return to the period of apron-strings of course did not fail to excite comment . Three months had passed since the parting of the heiress and her prince consort , and the event had been noticed in those newspaper columns which occupy themselves with the doings of the rich . The brilliant young ladies and gentlemenwhose business it was to flit from flower to flower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insinuating questions ; they expected him to answer in the same tone , and he did so . " My wife has her reasons for wishing to be at home for the present . I am here on picture business , and am planning to leave for New York before long . " He would say it with a grin , and add : " Nothing more . " Cablegrams would be shot to New York , asking about storks on the extensive red-tiled roofs of Shore Acres . Telephone calls would come to the estate , and Irma would be furious . Lanny , who had n't said a word but the truth , thought he was entitled to have a few smiles out of his misfortunes . There was going to be a grand evening reception and dance at the town house of Margy Petries , to mark the coming out of MarcelineDetaze , just eighteen , and one of the loveliest young creatures your eyes ever fell upon . Her mother had decided that a London debut would be distinguished , and it had better come before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working two rackets at the same time , selling airplanes and a daughter ; there was no conflictbetween the efforts , for the same man might elect to buy both , and it would all be in the family . From the mother 's aspect , manner , and conversation you would never have guessed that there was anything " spiritual " about her ; but upstairs in a room of this ample dwelling , full of historic memories , a retired real-estate salesman from a small town in Iowa sat for hours at a time in front of his fireplace with his eyes closed . He was doing what he called praying , a form of mental exercise which consistedin fixing his mind upon images of the good , the true , and thep332beautiful , to the exclusion of a world full of the bad , the false , and the ugly . The method must be working , for whenever Beauty enteredthat room she came out with a light of hope in her eyes and feelings of love in her heart . Was it not love of Marceline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Was it not love of Robbie and the other stockholders , including Margy , her hostess , which prompted her to try to sell fighter planes to the British who apparently needed them so badly ? Truly , it would be terrible if the British home and Mediterranean fleets were to be destroyed ; what then would protect this beautiful old town house , and the spreading country estate , and all the other charming places where Beauty Budd had been having good times for more than thirty years  --  ever since Petries ' Peerless had become Eversham-Watson and had brought her here and introduced her as the ex-wife of Budd Gunmakers ? A touching and pathetic thing to see Marcel 's daughter at this great moment of her life ; a lovely frail butterfly just emerged from her chrysalis , waving her wings in the sun and preparing to take flight into the wide world . A wonderful rose-pink toilet had been got ready and Lanny was privileged to see it in advance . No use tryingfor the serious talk which he had been preparing in his mind ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you going to break off with Alfy , dear ? " " Oh , Lanny , he 's so fussy ! He quarrels with everything I do . He thinks I 'm nothing but a silly . " " tiVell , are you ? " he wanted to say ; but it might have spoiled the party . " Have you invited him ? " " Of course . I wrote him a nice note , even though he was an old bear the last time I saw him . I suppose he 'll come , if his very importantstudies permit ; but I do n't believe he 'll enjoy it , because he thinks that parties are frivolous and that I ought to be learning nursingor something . " " Well , " said Lanny , " he thinks there 'll be another war , and he expectsto be an aviator , so he may need to be nursed . " " Oh , Lanny , you think of such depressing things ! I believe you taught them to him ! " P333Beauty found time for a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the persons he might meet at this affair was RosemaryCodwilliger , pronounced Culliver , only you did n't have to pronounce it since she had become the Countess of Sandhaven . Lanny said : " Rick told me she was in town . " " Tell me honestly , are you going to take up with that horrid woman again ? " " Unless she has changed greatly , she 's not in the least horrid , Beauty . She was gentle and kind , and taught me no end . " " She seduced you , and then turned you down twice , " declared this stern moralist . " That 's enough for any man 's mother . " " If she had married me , " countered the man , " she 'd have been just as unhappy as Irma , and what good would that have done either of us ? " " Tell me , are you going to let it happen again ? " " If it will comfort you to know , I am going to live in poverty and chastity and devote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk that way to Rosemary when he met her in the ballroom . Seven or eight years had passed , and he was prepared to see the ravages of time , but there was none to be observed . She was a year older than he , but that does n't mean so much in the mid-thirties as it does in the mid-teens . She had been in the Argentine and then in the Far East ; evidently she had taken care of herself wherever she was . She was of that sort , serene , unhurried and unworried ; the best of everything came to her , for she had inheritedthat good part . Her heavy flaxen hair had lost none of its luster and her shoulders and back none of their smooth whiteness . She wore a cream satin gown with one deep-purple orchid at the V in front . Had she put that on for him ? " Oh , Lanny ! " she exclaimed . " It 's so good to see you ! I came just on your account . " " I had to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad you 're here . You have n't changed a bit . Where is Bettie ? "   " He 's in the Canadian Rockies , trying to shoot a wild sheep . How is Irma ? " " She 's quite well . She 's in New York . " " Are you happy , Lanny ? " " Who is , entirely ? " " We all hope to be ; and you deserve it , because you 're so kind . " " Happiness does n't always go with kindness . It 's as wild as a Rocky Mountain sheep . " They danced , and it was just like the old days ; they moved together , they felt themselves one , they were wrapped in a garment made of a thousand agreeable memories : the nights on the banks of the Thames , looking at the stars on the water and listening to Kurt playing the piano ; the nights on the shore of the Golfe Juan , listening to a distant orchestra playing the barcarole from the Tales of Ho ff rn c . Belle suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuit plus douce que les jours , 0 belle nuit d'amour ! Nights much later , ten years or more , when they had sat before the fire in her villa and he had recited to her all the poetry he knew . She was one of the most adorable of women , and if he wanted to be consoled , her bosom would be soft and warm . She said : " Bertie has quit the diplomatic service , you know ; they worked him too hard and would n't give him any real promotion ; and anyhow , he wanted to be free and play round . " Lanny knew what that meant : " My husband prefers shooting sheep to taking care of his wife . " " Playing round " meant some other woman , as it had meant in the old days . She might as well have said : " I am free , Lanny , if you want me . " Did he want her ? He did and he did n't ; such problems are less simple at thirty-six than at sixteen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course they could n't dance together the whole evening ; that would have made a scandal . He strolled out on the terrace , it being a still evening and not too cold . There was young Alfred PomerovNielsonpacing up and down , very ill-contented ; he had had one dance with his beloved and could n't expect more at her debut party . " Hello , Alfy ! " said the old friend of his family . " How do you find Magdalen ? "   " Oh , it 's all right , " said the youth , English fashion ; then , in a sudden burst : " Tell me something , will you , Lanny ? " " Anything I know , old man . " " Does Marcy really love me ? " " Well , that 's not for yes or no . She 's a very different person from you , and what she means by love may be different from what you mean . " " She keeps me in a dither all the time . Sometimes I think it 's my fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined that love would mean peace and understanding , but I discover it 's a struggle of wills . Is that right ? " " What something is and what it ought to be are often quite different . " Lanny took the arm of the tall slender young man , who at this time happened to have exactly half as many months on earth as Lanny himself had . With his dark hair and keen intellectual features he seemed a return to life of Rick as Lanny had seen him when he had volunteered as a flier and come to Paris for a two-day furlough . Moved by sudden pity , the older said : " Alfy , I 'll tell you somethingthat your father and mother know , but otherwise it 's a secret . My own marriage happens to be on the rocks right now . " " Oh , Lanny , I 'm so sorry ! " Alfy was quite overcome , partly because he had believed this a really happy union and partly because of the honor his father 's friend was doing him by his confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lanny went on . " But this is what I 've been thinking about love and marriage for many years : that the most indispensable thing is intellectual harmony . Nietzsche says somewhere that the most important question for a man to consider is whether he 's going to be bored by what the woman says to him at breakfast every morning ; for that is what marriage comes down to . " " That 's a new thought to me , I admit , Lanny . " " It is something to think about beforehand , rather than afterwards , and save yourself a lot of regrets . " " Then you do n't think I ought to try to marry Marcy ? " Lanny smiled . " Do n't put that responsibility on me ! I 'm telling you what has caused my unhappiness , and you decide whether it means anything to you . " They went inside , because Lanny had promised to give an exhibitiondance with his half-sister ; they did the maxixe , a society dance which had been popular when Lanny was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . They took the ballroom floor , and the fashionable company sat in the chairs which lined the walls . Half-brother and sister made a lovely couple , and knew each other so well they had n't had to rehearse . Robbie Budd was there ; he watched and thought that his one wild oat had produced two very fine flowers . ( He took Marceline for his , because he had set Beauty up in Bienvenu and had supported both the painter and the child . ) Beauty watched , bursting with pride , for these flowers were hers beyond dispute  --  and who now would say they were not worth the price they had cost ? Apparently no one , for there was vigorous applause , and the couple had to do an encore . A most effective way to show off a debutante ; the mothers of eligible sons sat gazing through their jeweled lorgnettes and weighed the problem of a French painter 's daughter who could hardly be as good as she looked . The grandson of a baronet watched and weighed , and so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his problems , but thinking about Lanny : " Should I have married him ? Or would I rather be a countess ? " She danced with him again ; after which they sat in one of the side rooms and he brought her food and drink , and they chatted . Having given sound advice , Lanny now decided to apply it . The news about the Hoare-Laval Pact , as it was called , had appeared in New York that morning and had been in the London papers of the afternoon . Addressing an ex-diplomatist 's wife , Lanny remarked : " What 's this , Rosemary , about a deal with France over Abyssinia ? " " I 've been told about it , " she replied . " Too bad it had to break into the newspapers ahead of time . It will stir up a lot of fuss . " " I suppose so , " he admitted . " What can we do ? " she went on . " We certainly do n't want to get into a war over a place like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to make some reasonable arrangement . "   " I imagine you could put Mussolini out without too much trouble , " he remarked ; " but you might get something worse in his place . " " Exactly ! " exclaimed his old sweetheart . " Most probably some wild-eyed Red . " So Lanny decided it was up to him to take his own advice . When Rosemary said : " Will you come to see me ? " he answered : " I 'm afraid I wo n't have time , old darling . I 'm working hard for my father , and then I have to-go back to New York . I 'm not free like you , alas ! " LANNY thought he had never seen such a show of public anger as resulted from the publication of the Hoare-Laval Pact to surrenderAbyssinia to Mussolini . Rick spoke at a huge mass meeting in Trafalgar Square and at another in Albert Hall , and at both places the audience roared its indignation over this betrayal of a public trust . The intensity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had n't been time for anybody to forget the promises made by the government . One feature of the campaign had been a poster showing Baldwin 's fist hammered down on the Covenant of the League of Nations , with the proclamation : " OUR WORD IS OUR BOND . " And now , before three weeks had passed , they were selling the League out and turning its procedure into a farce ! Lanny thought : " Well , I helped a little . " He said it to his chum , who replied : " Stay right where you are , my lad , and bring us all the news you can pick up . " This was pleasant for Lanny in a way , be- cause it spared him the pain of breaking with his environment ; it was hard in another way , because his feelings were becoming so intense . He had to keep repeating Zoltan 's formula : " I am an art lover , and do not take sides on political questions . " To himself he said : " It 's exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mother back to Paris . Marceline went along , for she and Beauty were going to Bienvenu for the season 's doings . As for Robbie , he expected orders from both British and French governments , but they were smaller than he had looked for and he was more than ever disgusted with bureaucratic sluggards . He owed it as a matter of courtesy to report to Zaharoff , and Lanny drove him out there , and watched again how this old man 's being came to life while listening to talk about marketing instruments of death . He chuckled and said : " I remember my first sale of the Nordenfeldtsubmarine , which in those days was as hard for the officials to believe in as planes are now . I sold one to my own Greek government , and then I went to the Turks , whom I hated , and said : The Greeks have one of these , and so your whole fleet is in direst peril . You must have two if you wish to feel safe . ' So they bought two ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robbie knew that story , and told the old spider that it was a classic of their industry ; whereat the spider was pleased . " The man you ought to visit right now is Mussolini , " he said ; but the American replied : " Unfortunately my hands are tied , because my government has issued an imbecile neutrality proclamation , forbidding the sale of munitions to any belligerent . " " Well , then , go to Goring , " suggested the Knight Commander . " That will surely stir them out of their sleep . " " I have been invited by him , " was Robbie 's answer . " I 've been waiting until I had something definite to tell him about what the others are doing . " " Tell him anyhow , " said Sir Basil . " In my day I made it a rule to tell people that things were so , and then I went ahead and made them so . When I found that the Maxim machine gun was better than the Nordenfeldt , I told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . It was n't long before I had bought Maxim out , so what differ-P339ence did it make ? " Few people had ever seen the munitions king of Europe laugh , and now , when Lanny saw it , he thought it an unlovelyspectacle . Lanny had guessed that his father would n't be overlooking the German market , and had been prepared to be asked for an introductionto the German Air Commander . Now , however , he learned that Goring had sent an agent to see Robbie in Paris and that Robbie was going to Berlin in the next few days . As it happened , Zoltan had got an order for one of the General 's pictures ; and Lanny received a letter from a merchant in Berlin , one of Johannes 's old associates , saying that hard times and increased taxes had decided him to follow Lanny 's suggestion and put a price on several old masters . So , on the way back from Zaharoff 's , Lanny said : " Would you like me to drive you to Berlin ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son ; I ought to fly . Why do n't you come with me ? " It was mid-December , but aviation techniquehad been so perfected that passenger planes were rarely off schedule . Lanny said : " All right , " for he must n't forget that it was his father who had given him the tip about the Hoare-Laval deal , and possibly the fat General would talk more frankly to a man of large affairs than he had ever talked to an art lover . Certainly , if you were going to be an anti-Nazi spy , you could n't have picked a better father than the president of Budd-Erling . Robbie had told Zaharoff that Goring would probably want to lease the American patents ; but Robbie would n't consider that , he was going to keep the business in his own hands , and the old munitioneerhad agreed that this was the part of wisdom . " Make him pay , plane by plane , " he said . Neither of them appeared to have considered the possibility that the fat General might steal Robbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny brought up this question , and the father replied : " Businessmen do n't do things like that . It would n't pay them in the long run , because nobody would have anything more to do with them . "   " You think of Goring as a business man , Robbie ? " " He 's rapidly becoming one of the biggest . I 'm told he 's building the greatest steel plant in Germany , and it 's privately owned . " " Yes , Robbie ; any pirate or bandit might go into business after he 's got enough money . I suppose Al Capone might have , if the government had let him alone . " " Well , when he did , he 'd be a business man ; he 'd learn that the way to make profits is to do business on a big scale , and in order to do that you have to make your word count with the people from whom you buy and to whom you sell . What you call capitalism pays a lot better than any piracy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " replied the errant son , and smiled to himself , thinking how naive his father was  --  as naive as any Nazi ! Lanny knew that it would n't do any good to pursue the subject , because this man of great affairs would pay no attention to what a Pink might say . Robbie was just like Irma , he refused to believe that the Nazis were as bad as they advertised themselves , and he found excuses for each and every evil deed that was brought to his atten- ' tion . They had plundered Johannes Robin  --  yes , of course , but then Johannes had been an unconscionable Schieber , and as such he should have taken the precaution to get out of Germany at once and not try to sail on a yacht . Robbie would n't say that to Johannes , naturally  --  he rarely mentioned the Nazis to his associate . But both of them had been business men all their lives and would take it for granted that their duty to the stockholders of Budd-Erling outweighed any duty they might owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering generality . Robbie would handle the German market himself , and no Jewish names would appear in connection with the concern ; after the profits had been made  --  well , pecuniat non olet , money has no smell , and Johannes , a stockholder on a small scale , would put the dividend checks to his bank account and not to his nose . " And besides , " said Robbie , pursuing the argument , " how could I keep Goring from stealing my designs if he wants to ? He can buy one of my newest models through an intermediary , and when he has one he has everything . "   " What would you do if he stole them ? " " I 'd threaten to sue him , and he 'd know I have a case . I might n't get justice in his courts , but I 'd put my case before the business world in Britain and France and America , and it would cost him many times as much as he 'd stand to gain . You see , son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , regardless of politics . Standard Oil has a big deal regarding patent rights with I. G. Farben , the German dye trust , and so have the du Ponts . The A.L.G. , the electrical trust , is in the same position , and I do n't doubt that the Hermann Goring Stahlwerke have many such understandings in America . Anyhow , the men who run those big German trusts are Goring 's bosses , do n't you ever forget it ; they 'd soon make him see that he 's no longer a bandit but a captain of industry . " " I suppose so , " said Lanny , meekly . He , too , must play his game according to the rules . Father and son had an early breakfast in Paris and a late lunch in Berlin , after which a staff car called for Robbie to bring him to the fat General , while Lanny went to see his client , inspected his art works , and agreed upon a list of prices . When he got back to the hotel , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stubendorf and the message had been forwarded to Berlin , Kurt being here to see his music publisher . Lanny said : " Herrlich ! Come to dinner ! " He called Heinrich Jung , who was no less pleased , and began telling Lanny over the telephone all the wonders of a new illustrated textbook which his organization was distributing to German-speaking youth all over the world . Lanny had to remind himself that he was a Nazi neophyte , and that the achievements of the New Order were his own . Twenty-two years ago this Christmas the three boys had romped in the snow at Stubendorf , and listened to the old Graf speaking to his people about deutsche Treue and Win-de . How Lanny had loved the Germans in those days ! It seemed to him it was the Germans who had changed and that he was the true disciple of Beethoven andp342Goethe ; but he could never make them see it , and if they could read his thoughts they would call him a viper whom they had nourished in their bosom . Did Kurt guess ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in Heinrich , feeling sure that Kurt would not fail to warn the young official . But Heinrich appeared his usual naive and enthusiastic self , and talked as if . Lanny were a swimmer poised upon the bank and needing only the slightest push to get him into the water . Lanny had a story to tell about his visit to Berchtesgaden , and who had been there , and everything that had come from the mouth of the adored Adolf . Lanny gave the credit for this honor to Heinrich , and the Hauptforster 's son was so pleased and so absorbed in the narrativethat he almost forgot the large fat pheasant which his host had caused to be placed before him . Lanny told what his father was here for , and about the achievements of the new Budd-Erling fighter . Good news for the Fatherland , and Lanny neglected to mention that Robbie had also been marketing the plane in Britain and France . Heinrich told of the elaborate program whereby hundreds of thousandsof the youths of Germany were being taught to soar in glider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy ; Lanny said that he had seen this in the course of his motoring during the summer , and Heinrich added that his organization had issued much literature about it , and he would furnish Lanny with a set . Kurt revealed that he was planning to come to Paris before the winter was over . He did n't want to become provincial in his tastes , and had decided to make a study of French music , also to give recitalsin Paris ; that might be a way of building up friendship between the two peoples , as the Fuhrer so greatly desired . This sounded like the old Kurt talking , and Lanny was pleased . He had never given up the dream he had acquired at Hellerau , that the arts might become a means of international unification ; the art lovers , the good Europeans , would teach brotherhood and humanity to all the peoples . Einen Kuss der ganzen Welt ! Lanny described his visit to Salzburg , which seemed to him anotherHellerau ; but he found his two friends unwilling to accept this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them it was aP343somewhat pathetic effort of dissident elements to maintain a resistanceto German solidarity . Kurt and Heinrich wanted , not merely political and economic Anschluss with Austria , but intellectual and artistic as well , and they heard without joy about the crowds which had made it impossible for Lanny and his wife to find hotel accommodationsin the town . Lanny did n't mention the break with Irma ; he said that she was at Shore Acres , and he was planning to go there before long . He might be back in Paris later , and would be glad to see Kurt and do what he could to promote his musical efforts . Emily Chattersworth would help , also ; Kurt asked how she was , and expressed admiration for her . How much of it did he mean ? Lanny was n't going to forget how Kurt had come to Paris as a German agent and had exploited Emily 's interest in music . Was he coming now as an agent of the Nazis ? Of course he must know that Lanny would be thinking of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in toward the end of the evening , well pleased with himself , having apparently made a hit with the fat General . He had been invited to stay for dinner in the ministerial residence , and with several staff officers had talked aviation and what the various nations were doing with it . Robbie had collected a lot of information , and did n't mind revealing the fact to his son 's old friends . He did n't have to do any play-acting , for his point of view was clearcutand elementary  --  he believed in the survival of the fittest , and just at present fitness was proved by ability to appreciate and willingness to purchase the Budd-Erling   . Since Germany apparently stood first in possession of these qualifications , the criterion was satisfactory to Kurt Meissner and Heinrich Jung . The American of large affairs thought that he had seen some big things in the course of his life , but he admitted that he had learned something when he was escorted through the new building in Berlin which was to house the offices of the German Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing  --  and instantane- ous connection with every airport and military establishment in Germany . Imagine the size of the force which was going to require all that administering ! Robbie talked technicalities , and the German pair listened with a glow in their cheeks , even while they did n't understand the details . Lanny watched and thought to himself : " No , Kurt , you 're not going to Paris to learn about French music , or yet because you want to help the spread of an all-European culture ! " After the guests had left , Robbie talked about his business affairs . As he had foreseen , the fat General had wanted to lease his patents ; if the Budd-Erling stood up to the tests which were scheduled for tomorrow morning , the General would offer him an annual cash subsidy , with a twenty per cent increase year after year for as long as the patents were used . That was to take the place of a royalty on each plane  --  since the number of planes manufactured would have to be a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet for the company , the investors having taken stock for their rights . It would put the concern on easy street , and Lanny could see that his father was strongly tempted . He gave no thought to the moral questions involved ; if British and French planes were ever machine-gunned and driven out of the sky by Budd-Erling planes , it would teach something to those bureaucrats and brass-hats whom Robbie Budd had been fighting ever since the last war . What but a machine-gun bullet could penetrate their armor-plated skulls ? " Strictly between you and me , " remarked the manufacturer , " I believe that Goring is making a serious mistake ; what he really needs is bombing-planes , for how else will he be able to get at Britain ? It 's the British who will need the fighters for defense . But you see , Goring was a flier in the last war and his mind is obsessed by those memories . He talked for an hour or more about his own exploits , and made plain that what he expects is a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Germans winning glory like himself , and the qualities he wants in his planes are speed and maneuverability . He does n't foresee the coming of heavier planes , with armor and doubled firepower . But of course it 's not up to me to teach him his business ; I have n't any bombers to sell ! "   " Make him pay ! " exclaimed the son ; and the father replied : " Oh , boy , trust me ! " Lanny might have gone to witness the tests , but once had been enough for him ; he was sick of images of wholesale slaughter , and conversation about it , and especially about the profits to be derived from it . It seemed to him that he had been born into a most unlovely time and place and section of society ; he yearned for some remote and peaceful isle in the South Seas . That being impossible , he made an appointment with Oberleutnant Furtwaengler  --  now promoted to be Hauptmann  --  to meet him and get the painting ; he would have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Express Company . Also he was sending cablegrams concerning his other client 's paintings ; it might be possible that he would have orders for some of these before Robbie was ready to leave . There would be some money to turn over to Trudi Schultz , and a lot of data which Rick might make into a series of articles . He was sorry he had n't gone along with his father , who came back late in the day with a wonderful story . The plane had stood the most exacting tests , and the fat General had been so pleased that he had shown the plane 's creator some of the closely guarded secrets of the new German Air Force . Robbie had been taken to Kladow , a village near Berlin which had been turned into a center of aviation research . It was now a tract eight miles in circumference , with four thousand men at work day and night on the buildings and grounds . It was like an immense university , in fact two of them , an Academy of Air War and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every airplane known  --  to Robbie 's consternation the fat General had shown him copies of all the seven Budd-Erling models , and stood shaking with laughter as he watched the American 's face . Also there were models of every sort of military target , and studentspracticing at bombing them . There was one of the most powerfulradio stations in the world , and even a yacht club on a lakeshore . The goggle-eyed visitor had been escorted into one of the underground hangars , so deep that no bomb could reach them and with the entrances so camouflaged with nets and other devices that no air photographs would reveal them . Everything complete under there , including living-quarters for the operating and maintenance staffs ; a reading-room with the latest technical magazines , and writingpadsso that the men could make notes of anything important . " By God ! " added the awe-stricken business man . " They even had a freshly sharpened pencil alongside each pad ! " What was it that caused the master of this magic thus to reveal his secrets to a stranger ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military preparations five times as much as Britain and more than two and a half times as much as Britain and France together ? Was it the sudden impulse of a braggart ? Robbie guessed that it was a considered policy ; the Nazis wished to frighten their opponents and to spread a legend of invincibility , against the time when the Fiihrer might be ready to make his next move . " You can see it working in the case of Italy , " he remarked . " The British are afraid to fire a gun at Suez , because they ca n't really be sure that Il Duce is lying about his new air force . " " Is he ? " asked Lanny ; and the father replied : " How can I be sure ? " Of course Kladow was " just the nuts " for Robbie Budd . He could go back to Paris and London and tell harrowing stories about what he had seen . They would think he was exaggerating , naturally ; but they could n't know , and vague anxiety would creep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Robbie would tell them , speaking of it as if it had already begun , " this war is going to be different from the last ; it 's going to be right over your own heads , and all you diplomats , bureaucrats , and office-rats will have to dig deep holes . " They did n't appreciate his crude American humor . For once Lanny was in agreement with his father , in the desire that Britain and France should have fighting-planes . It distressed him that the Nazis should be getting any ; but Robbie had his answer allP347pat : " If I did n't get Gering 's orders I might n't be able to keep going , and America would n't have my fine fabricating-plant . With the ocean between us and our enemies , what we need is not great numbersof planes , but the means of building them quickly . If I sell a batch to Goring , I 'll go home and put the cash into building a better one ; already I 've got the mock-up ' started , and a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have nothing . " " Unless Goring uses your planes to get something in the meantime , Robbie . " " Well , he ca n't get anything from America , and that 's all you and I have to worry about . " Robbie had turned down the offer to lease his patents ; he was here to sell planes , he said , and the next day he sold twenty of them , at $21,500 each . A contract was prepared , with Lanny helping his father as translator , a service which entitled him to have his Berlin expenses charged against the company . It was Robbie 's first big deal in his new field , and there were many traps to be watched out for ; the long document had to be studied phrase by phrase , and several times in a day Robbie had a telephone conference with Johannes , who knew the German language , and contracts , and the Nazis . " You see how it is , " said the father . " Goring knows what he wants , and he puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in Washington ! Our army men have seen just what Goring has seen , and they know that no plane can equal ours , yet they have to go through the farce of advertising specifications and inviting bids ! " " I admit that the Nazis ' is the right way to get things done , " repliedthe stubborn son . " But suppose it 's the wrong things ? " " You can be sure it 's the right thing in this case , " replied the patientfather . " You notice the General insists upon getting his planes ahead of any other customers . I take it that something is going to happen this spring . " Lanny had promised to pay a call at the office of Heinrich Jung ; that seemed a cheap return for the telephone message to the Berghof .   Of course Heinrich had told all over the place the story of his friend 's visit to the Fiihrer , and now all the staff of the **25;8755;TOOLONG the honor of shaking the hand which had shaken the Fiihrer 's hand only four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something which could n't be affected by soap and water . As he sat beside his friend 's desk , Lanny 's eye could n't help roaming , and among the papers lying there , one gave him an inner start . A tiny thin pamphlet , three inches by four , strangely familiar to his eyes . It was lying so that the letters were upside down to him , but he could read the two biggest words , and guess the others : " ABRAHAMLINCOLN : Sena Leben and Seine Ideen . " " I notice that title , Heinrich , " he said , pointing . " May I look at it ? " " Surely , " answered his friend , and handed it over . " Abraham Lincoln . Are you circulating literature about him ? " " That is not our literature . " Lanny read again : " Leipzig : Deutscher Nationalsocialistischer Kul-turbund . " " I have made certain that there is no such organization , " explained the official . " The thing is printed by some of our secret enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Ausserordentlich ! How did you get it ? " " It was deposited in the dinner-pail of a young factory worker who has been educated by our organization . He turned it over to his Gauleiter , who forwarded it to us . " " I should think that would be a case for the Gestapo , " ventured the caller . " Naturlich . I called them and learned that they already have copies . We have reason to think that the thing has been printed abroad , for it has appeared near the border in several different places . " " What wo n't they think of next ! " exclaimed the American . " It is a particularly vicious document , " remarked the official . " You start reading a perfectly sound story of Abraham Lincoln  --  I admit that I did n't know much about him , and was interested at once . But before long I began to see that its character had changed ; it became a series of poisonous remarks  --  all rather vague , so that the averageP349ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he would be absorbing all sorts of doubts as to the sincerity of our regime and the reality of our achievements . " " That might be pretty dangerous , Heinrich . " " It wo n't take us long to track the thing down . There have been a whole series of schemes , each more cunning than the last , but they have all been detected and the criminals have been put where they ca n't do any harm . For the most part this propaganda is being carried on with foreign money , and our job is to find out where that comes from . " " I should think that Kurt might be of use to you in a matter like that , " ventured Lanny . " No , Kurt would n't have the right contacts for such work . " Heinrich'sbright blue Aryan eyes gazed into Lanny 's brown ones with perfect candor . " It might be that I would have . You know , I have met a lot of those people , and have some relatives among them . They talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint . " " Herrlich , Lanny ! If you hear anything , and will let me know , I 'll surely make use of it , and you will earn my everlasting gratitude . " " You have earned mine already , " said the American , as he laid the poison-pen pamphlet back on the Nazi 's desk . So Lanny had an interesting story to tell Trudi when he flew back to Paris . He had his ten per cent on two picture sales to put into her hands , and she had the proofs of a new pamphlet celebrating Bismarckas the founder of the modern German state . At least , it celebratedhim for the first page and a half , and after that it turned into a carefully documented indictment of force as the basis of a state 's progress in the modern world . Why was the Nazi regime keeping secret its budget of military expenditures ? Was it hoping to deceive Germany 's neighbor states , or was it the German people themselves who were not allowed to know that their government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? itP350 Lanny stopped his reading , and said : " You can make it stronger . It is five times as much as Britain and more than two and a half times as much as Britain and France combined . So Goring told my father a few days ago . " " So much the better , " said Trudi . Already she was learning to take the writer 's point of view ! " The comrades who are doing the distributing are to be complimented , " said Lanny . He repeated what Heinrich had said , and added : " Do n't ever give me a hint about those people . I might say it in my sleep sometime ; but I can never say it if I do n't know it . " " You might get it by telepathy , " smiled his friend . He took her for a drive , and they had lunch in a remote auberge by the bare and frosty banks of one of those seven rivers which meander through the plains surrounding Paris . He had laid down rules as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeying them , with the result that she had regained some of her lost weight and had a little color in her cheeks . She could still worry all she pleased about the fate of her husband and friends , but she no longer had to be afraid for her own physical safety , and the human creature is so constitutedthat this is a great relief to the subconscious if not to the conscious mind . " My father wants me to go back to New York with him , " he told her , " but I think I 'll make excuses . " " You ought to go , Lanny , " insisted the woman . " Your wife may have changed her mind . " " There is the mail , " he responded . " I know ; but there is her pride to be considered . She does n't want to lose her status and be taken for granted . She has to be wanted , if , love is to mean anything . " " I 'll go a bit later ; I 've promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a party . And besides , I have to admit that my father 's conversation tries my patience . I 've heard a couple of weeks ' talk about destroying men and making money , and it becomeshard for me to be polite . I 've done a lot of philosophizing about what seems to me a ghastly perversion of thought . My father is a good man in many ways , a man of real creative energy . He 's sup-P351posed to be educated , too  --  he went to Yale , and they taught him a social code that might have come out of ancient Rome . He talks about the survival of the fittest , and takes it for granted that the fittestare the most greedy . He 's not at all like that himself ; he 's generousand considerate to his friends , and it 's only when he thinks of social classes and nations that you 'd take him for another HermannGoring . " Trudi made a curious reply : " I wonder if Goring could be like that , too . " Christmas at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no children . Lanny realized more acutely that he had lost his family . Of course there was Marceline , who remained a child even while playing at being a young lady . He was fond of her , and glad to see her happy ; he tried to teach her something that might be of use to her , and he kept on , even though sadly aware that most of what he said went in at one ear and out at the other . It was n't that she did not have the brains ; it was that she had been trained by Beauty and Beauty 's friends , including Irma . For six years she had lived in the reflected glory of the Barnes fortune , and while she did n't admit it to Lanny , she was dreaming of making a rich match and becoming a grande dame whose doings would be reported in the newspapers. , Lanny could disturb and distress her by his antisocial remarks , but he was powerless to change her . He did n't want to live in the Cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a cot put in his studio , and stayed there a good part of the time , playing the piano and reading the books of his great-great-uncle which had decorated the walls for many years . Also he pushed the picture business , so as to keep a stream of illegal literature flowing into Germany  --  that was his excuse for living . But he was restless , because he had been a married man and now he was what the world called a grass-widower , and he missed what he had got used to . All the time there was his mother , watching him yearningly , push ing at him gently but firmly ; she spoke only a small part of her thoughts , but Lanny knew them all  --  he was to go back to Irma , apologize and promise to be " good , " and repair his dreadful blunder before it was too late . She begged him to write and say that he was coming ; to pacify her , he did this . He told Irma about his trip with Robbie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oberleutnant becoming a Hauptmann ; he told about the party in London and the one being prepared at Sept Chcnes ; he sent messages of love to his little daughter and promised to come and see her before the end of January . He added : " I am sorry , and I still love you " ; but he did n't follow his mother 's sly suggestion and mention having danced with Rosemary at his half-sister 's debut party . Right after New Year 's , Emily Chattersworth arrived , bringing her servants according to her custom . She had offered to have the party at her place , and now Beauty would have the time of her life giving the orders and going over the lists of guests with her old friend . The Riviera was a place where people came and went , and you had to study the newspapers and then telephone your friends to find out who the newcomers were ; your friends would ask you to invite So-and-so , and if you valued these friends you would say Yes , and if you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enemies . You must n't have too long a list , because that would n't be distingue ; on the other hand , if you had too few , that would indicate that you were skimping . Robbie had given Beauty a check for her services , and had added ten thousand francs for Marceline , telling the mother to go the limit , since the girl would have only one chance . There would n't be any need to engage " talent , " since she and Lanny would provide it ; but there must be the best colored band on the Riviera , and there must be food and drink without limit . Lanny had taken part in preparations of this sort ever since he could remember ; he had run errands and offered advice  --  at first his mother had accepted it in a spirit of play , but before long she began accepting it seriously . Now he was not merely Beauty 's son butp353Irma 's husband , which meant that he was an authority on the affairs of the beau monde , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano and refuse to take any interest in the question whether Prince Dimitrovitch was an ex-nobleman or only a sort of ex-country squire , and whether Mrs. Packingham from Chicago was socially important now that she was living here permanently on a comparatively small alimony . Marceline had never taken any responsibility ; it was her role to be beautiful , gay , and free , and this she did to perfection . Having already been launched under the best auspices in London , she was invited everywhere , and had to be advised which invitations to acceptand which to evade . She was n't told in crude language that certain persons had money while others lacked it ; she was told in refined language that certain families were " desirable , " and that certainpartis  --  that is , candidates for matrimony  --  were " hardly eligible , " while others were " catches . " If the parti was European , some memberof his family or else the family lawyer would make the proper approach to Beauty or Lanny ; while if he was American , he waded right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a girl just turned eighteen to know how to deal with these different sorts of males : which it was safe to flirt with , which must be treated with reserve , and which must be " frozen . " The Riviera was full of all kinds of pretenders and parasites , impecunious noblemen and refugees from revolutions which might or might not be permanent , so that marryingoff a daughter became a political as well as an economic problem . Among many candidates was a nephew of the Marchesa di San Girolamo , who lived very modestly in an unfashionable part of Cannes . The marchesa belonged to one of the oldest Tuscan families , but there had been some scandal which nobody seemed to know about , and she had been a resident of the Cote d'Azur since before Mussolini . Just recently had come this nephew , a Fascist aviator with the rank of captain ; he had led the first attack by an Italian squadron in Abyssinia , and after gloriously bombarding native , troops and villages and being decorated for it he had been grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come near to death , having crawled into hiding and been saved from the savage enemy only by the advance of Il Duce 's army . As a reward for all this he had several medals , a badly scarred body , a bloodless pale face , and an empty left sleeve . From the happy days before his accident he had brought aristocratic features and a tiny sharp-pointed black mustache ; also pride , romantic charm , and a devil-may-care spirit . A dangerous person , as any competent mother would instantly perceive ; and it did not escape Beauty Budd 's mother-eagle eye that this elegamtissinzo was strongly attracted to her incomparable daughter . Vittorio di San Girolamo could n't dance like the other suitors , but he could stroll on a terrace in the moonlight or sit by a gleaming fireside and tell hair-raising stories about solo flights along the sides of mountain precipices , dropping bombs upon fortresses never before seen by a white man , so close to the targets that the explosions would throw the plane into the air ; plunging down into canyons so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage enemies who were accustomed to inflict dreadful mutilations upon prisoners of war . When Marceline came home and repeated these tales , the anxious mother replied : " Do n't forget , my darling , he probably has a pension of a couple of hundred lire a month  --  about sixteen dollars  --  and his aunt has to collect her income from a score of peasant families who scratch a bare living out of terraces on a mountainside . " It gave Lanny satisfaction to see the British Foreign Secretary forced out of office as a result of the Hoare-Laval fiasco ; but Rick wrote him not to be too hopeful . " The Tories will bend before the storm , but they wo n't break , " said the Englishman . " Public opinion in this country can prevent some especially flagrant offense , but it is powerless to compel any sound positive action . Mussolini will go right ahead with his conquest , and in the end he 'll probably get more than Hoare-Laval tried to give him . " The forces of protest in France were equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep away from it entirely  - -  he would learn about a meeting somewhere in the neighborhoodP355and decide that he ought to know what the people were thinking and saying ; he would slip in unobserved and sit in a corner , and when he found that the speakers did n't know as much as they ought to , he would yearn to get up and tell the whole truth . He would take Raoul to lunch , finding excuse to drive somewhere into the country where they would n't be recognized . He knew that German agents swarmed like flies over the Riviera , and he did n't want to sacrifice any part of his double role . French national elections were due in the spring , and all the energiesof the Left were centered upon getting rid of the fripon mongol and his gang . The Front Populaire program was now in effect and the two powerful workers ' parties , Communist and Socialist , had ceased their sniping at each other . It was the thing for which an American Pink had been pleading over a period of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in spite of all difficulties . Raoul said that those at the school were doing their best ; he believed the effort would succeed , at least until after the election period , but it was hard to travel along with Communists , because they had a philosophywhich justified intrigue and deception . Did any Communist ever really believe in parliamentary methods of procedure ? Lanny recalled what Bess had said , and fell silent . The elections in Spain were due even earlier , in February ; and there Raoul had high hopes . The united front was working there also , and a tremendous campaign of education was being carried on among the peasants and the workers in the towns . In spite of all the jailings and beatings , nothing had been able to stop it . " My people are fierce individualists , " said the school director . " Really , Lanny , you ought to go there and get to know them ; it would do your heart good . A man may be in rags , and wearing sandals made of rope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has learned who it is that is exploiting his labor . " " I am expecting to leave for New York in a few days , " Lanny explained . " When I come back , I might like to take such a trip . Would you care to go with me and act as interpreter ? " " I 'm afraid it would be risky for me to go into Spain , Lanny ; they 're bound to have me on their shooting-list . "   " Not if you travel with a rich American , " replied the other , with a smile . " I would be an art expert , and I 'd take you into the palaces of your enemies ; they would tell you all their plans , just as they do here on the Riviera . I have to report the painful fact that they have no idea of submitting to a popular verdict if it goes against them ; that applies to Spain as to France . If they are forced to it , they will find some man like Mussolini , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs . " " I know , " said Raoul , sadly . " That is why I try not to quarrel with the Communists in spite of all provocations . We have to bear them in mind as a sort of last resort . There may be no peaceful way . " Marceline Detaze , half French and half American , had been reared in one country and got her ideas from another . She desired to live like an American girl on the Coast of Pleasure : to have her own car and drive where she pleased , to make her own dates , and above all to choose her husband without tiresome consultations with her elders . She was of an affectionate nature , but apparently that was on the surface and did not reach down to the level from which her actions were derived . She had in her an odd stubborn streak : she would listen amiably to all the warnings and exhortations  --  and then go quietly ahead and do what she pleased . She liked the company of Vittorio di San Girolamo . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was silly ; she was n't going to fall in love with any man , she was going to have a good time , and for a long , long time . She was going to have beaux , all kinds , and many of each . Since it was better for her to do her entertaining at home , Beauty invited the young airman to Bienvenu ; he came to lunch and spent the afternoon , and presently it was time to dress for dinner ; Marceline asked him to stay , and he was there all evening  --  for practical purposes a member of the family . To Lanny this was an unpleasant development , and Il Capitano di San Girolamo a most unpleasant personality . He was only twenty-P357four , and had n't read much , but there were few things he thought he did n't know . He had been filled to the brim with the Fascist ideology and his assurance that it comprehended all truth was the more annoying because it was expressed with such suavity and quiet dignity of manner . He knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the lands all about it , and he was sorry for any persons who had n't adjusted their minds to the fact . As to his personal future he was clear : his wounds , decorations , and family position entitled him to a diplomatic career , and to become governor of a province in that new Roman Empire which Il Duce was engaged in establishing . Sacro egoismo was the phrase ; you made yourself holy by the force with which you asserted your own Godhead . The Italians were the coming race , and Fascismo the creation of their genius . By the right of their newly discovered power and under the guidance of their great leader they would take what they pleased , as other races had done in the past , as their own race had done more than two thousand years ago , building an empire which had endured for centuriesand had been revived for yet more centuries . Vittorio had got his history out of some Fascist textbook , and apparently it had n't informed him that the Holy Roman Empire had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been governed by Franks and Teutons , never by Italians . This glorious bomber of barefooted black troops and mud-hovels had apparently never heard about his host 's eccentric ideas ; he took it for granted that Lanny believed what the other darlings of fortuneon the Riviera believed , and so he talked freely . Lanny held his tongue , and , watching his half-sister , perceived that she was swallowinghook , line , and sinker ; it was her first glimpse of the world of ideas and her first dream of glory . When he got her alone he tried patiently and kindly to show her how phony it was , the cheapest circus tinsel , illuminated by some kind of calcium light which would fizzle out quickly ; but he found that he was getting nowhere , for the reason that Marceline had heard ever since her childhood that her half-brother was a victim of the subtle Red propaganda  --  and now he was trying to pass the disease on to her ! No , Vittorio was a real hero , and his cause was proving itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny was licked before he began . He talked to his mother about it . " The fellow looks to me like a fortune-hunter under the sign of the fasces . All this career that he 's outlining depends upon money , and he has n't the nerve to claim that his own family has it . " " But , Lanny , he ca n't imagine that we have ! " " Of course he does ; he thinks we are American multimillionaires . We live on a big estate , and know all the smart people , and we 're planning a grand party . What else can he suppose ? " " He should see my unpaid bills ! " " All the rich have unpaid bills ; that is one of their privileges . He has doubtless heard that Robbie is launching a new industry . Above all , he knows about Irma . You are leaving your friends to suppose that she is coming back here , so naturally Vittorio imagines it 's all in the family . " " What do you want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight talk with him . He 's a Continental , and expects a dot ; he 'll count it a favor if I explain that Marceline wo n't have any . " " Will he believe you ? " " I 'll make it perfectly clear that I have no money but what I earn , that you have only the allowance my father gives you , and that I 've broken with my wife and wo n't have a cent of her money . " " Oh , my God , Lanny ! " " You 'll see how it works ! The Capitano will fold up his tents like the Arabs and as silently steal away . " " But , Lanny , the scandal ! " " Whatever scandal there is we have to face , and what 's the good of putting it off day after day ? " " Oh , you promised me you would go and see Irma ! " " I did and I will ; but I told you that nothing would come of it , and you only deceive yourself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , Lanny , Lanny ! We have been such a happy family ! And I thought all our problems were solved ! " She had tried , but could n't bring herself to face the cruel reality . No ! No ! Not a word ! Keep the skeleton locked in the family closet ! She would talk to the young airman herself , and tell him about the poverty which had dogged her all her life ; she would tell him that she had never had a penny from Irma and never expected to have one ; that the place was plastered with mortgages . " He wo n't be able to find out about that , will he , Lanny ? " " He can look it up any time he wants to ; and then he 'll think you 're lying about everything . " " I can tell him that the place belongs to Robbie , and that he 's threatened to turn me out and sell it . Robbie will back me up , for he certainly wo n't care to see Marceline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll call him ! " Margy Eversham-Watson came to occupy the Cottage for the season , and some friends of Sophie 's leased the Lodge ; so Beauty would have plenty of company , and a bridge four always at hand . Everybodywas interested in the coming party and helped when they could . When the great evening arrived , Lanny put on his white tie and tails , and Marceline a rose-pink tulle costume bought with Bobbie'smoney . The white-haired Emily looked stately and noble in black velvet , and the golden-haired Beauty Budd in white satin was asked if she was the debutante . Music , laughter , and the perfume of flowers filled the air of the very splendid villa . Lanny danced with light feet but a heavy heart ; having created patterns in times of joy , he could reproduce them in times of sorrow . The elegant company knew nothing about the state of his heart , and applauded enthusiastically ; the occasion was one of great eclat for the Budd-DetazeDinglefamily . There is an old song telling about the sad things which happen after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abdicating prince con- sort . He packed his bags for the drive to Marseille , with the family chauffeur to bring back the car . The last thing before departing he put his arm around Marceline , led her aside , and exhorted : " Remember , Little Sister , if you marry an Italian Fascist you come under their code , which makes woman nothing but a brood animal , and your one duty will be to bear children so that I1 Duce can have plenty of soldiers for his new empire . " Little Sister 's reply was : " Boo ! " HE proprieties are very important to the rich "  --  so remarked acharacter in one of Rick 's dramas . " If it were not for the proprieties , the poor would surely take their riches . " And now the visiting husbanddiscovered that the proprieties were going to rule at Shore Acres . Irma brought the child to meet him at the steamer , and the child provided all the warmth necessary to a proper reunion . She was at the age where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an inch or two taller , many pounds heavier , a new vocabulary , a set of new ideas , new questions . " Oh , Papa , why do you stay away so long ? Oh , Papa , will you stay for my birthday ? " He told her about the wonderful party they had had at Sept Chenes , and how he had danced with Marceline . Frances had a dancingteacher , a piano and singing teacher , and told him all about these . She prattled a little rudimentary French and he would teach her more ; in these matters she was in his hands . She had heard no hint that there was anything wrong with him ; a tragic thing that there had to be , and both the parents , sitting in the car with thep361eager little one between them , felt a tugging at their heart-strings . At Shore Acres he found the same desperate determination that the proprieties should rule . " Mother " and Uncle Horace came to the door to greet him . " Mother " kissed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one of the servants must see any sign that his status was diminished . Having lived in the fashionable world for thirty-six years , Lanny was familiar with the fact that people often say one thing when they mean another ; they laugh gaily when their hearts are weeping ; they express cordiality when in reality they dislikeyou and begin to run you down the moment you are out of the room . So now in the smiling faces of this elderly brother and sister he read anxiety , in their voices he heard mock humility . He understood the situation . He was the father of the most preciousof all children , and had committed no offense which would enable Irma to deprive hint of his rights . He might insist upon taking the little one away for six months every year , and no court in the world would say No . He might take her motoring and put her on board a steamer for France , and once outside the ten-mile limit , they might be forever powerless to get her back . So , bow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants and try to supply it , make him feel that this is his home , in which he can enjoy every privilege , and even the spiritual benefits of love and affection , cordiality and admiration . If he expresses dislike for any person , that person will cease to be invited ; if he expresses an opinion as to the prospects of the market , Uncle Horace , who considers himself Wall Street 's leadingauthority , will hasten to agree . What in their secret hearts did they feel , and what were they hoping the young couple would do ? Lanny would never know . Irma was the boss of the establishment ; she would settle it , and the elders , the dowager and the derelict , would accommodate themselves as best they could . That was the way the public utilities king had decreed it when he had drafted his will ; the widow down and the daughter up  --  and himself standing at the top of the great staircase , frowning down upon the scene , knowing that he had employed the best lawyersand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to her governess , and Lanny was alone with his wife in her apartment . He looked at her and she at him . " Well , Irma ? " he said ; and she answered : " Well , Lanny ? " " I have thought about it a lot , dear . " He waited , and when she did not answer he said : " It was you who went away . " " I know ; and you who have stayed a long while . " So they sparred . He asked : " You have n't changed your mind ? " and she replied : " Have you ? " Someone had to break the ice , and he had promised his mother to try . " I still love you , dear , " he said , and she answered : " I still love you ; but have you changed your mind ? " He said : " No , " and she at once replied : " I have n't changed mine . " So it was a deadlock , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long talk with Robbie since his return from abroad , and Robbie , sensible fellow , had known there was n't any use trying to fool her as to Lanny 's attitude . Robbie was a man who could be trusted with a confidence , and both had trusted him ; he had tried to serve as arbitrator , and the best compromise he could suggest was what they had right now . They would be friends , and be polite to each other , but go their own ways and not be husband and wife . Irma had the suite with the solid gold bathroom fixtures and Lanny had the suite with the solid silver bathroom fixtures . Between them hung a generously proportioned door of eucalyptus wood , known in the days of J. Paramount Barnes as " Circassian walnut " and very highly esteemed . That door stayed open both by day and by night , but neither of them crossed its threshold . Lanny would lie in his sumptuous bed with the baby-blue silk coverlet , and would try to guess : " What does she really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not simple , and he guessed that her emotions were mixed like his own . Did she want to be wanted , even though in vain ? If he came to her bedside and tried to seduce her , would she be secretly pleased or would she consider it a breach of faith ? There was much that he might have said . " I want you to know that I have n't been making love to any other woman . I have noP363thought of any other woman but you . " He might have said : " We have a great deal in common , dear , and for the child 's sake we ought to work out some arrangement . " She would have been willing to talk it out with him , but what had he to propose ? Would he give up his interest in left-wing causes ? Would he give up helping Trudi Schultz and others like her when they asked him ? Would he say that if ever he met some anti-Nazi or anti-Fascist in peril of his life he would n't help that person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things ; to broach the subject would be to start another wrangle , of the sort that killed all love and even friendship . As for Irma , would she say : " I am willing to go on loving you , even while I know that you are doing the things I hate and fear " ? Well , if she was willing to say anything like that , let her give him a hint ! Any woman knows how . He played the piano for Frances and watched her music lessons ; he taught her Provencal songs , and danced with her to the music of a phonograph ; he romped with her in the snow and pulled her on , a sled . She rarely went off the estate , for it had everything a child nearing six could desire , including the children of several of the staff , with whom she played under supervision of the trustworthy Miss Addington , who had educated Marceline . Irma 's friends came ; they were supposed to be his friends also , and they played squash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they danced in one another 's homes and in roadhouses built for their entertainment . Irma had always been a reserved woman , and Lanny a queer fish , so no one suspected trouble between them . When they went in to a show , they took the old people along , which was a kindness and at the same time spared an estranged couple the temptation to intimate talk . Lanny drove over to Newcastle and spent a while with his father 's family , visiting the new plant . They were working on the planes for General Goring , also on trainer planes for the United States Army and on sport planes for the rich . Aviation was spreading everywhere and the tireless Johannes was searching out new business ; flying to Canada , where freight was being ferried to prospectors in the northernwilderness ; to Central America , where planes were hopping over jungles and up into precipitous mountains . Robbie Budd was completelyabsorbed in his grand new job . Esther , taking Lanny for a confidant , reported that her husband was no longer going downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the quantity , and his substitute for the stock market was a night of poker once a week with his cronies . Lanny moved to the home which Hansi and Bess had bought on a point of the Connecticut shore . The couple went into the city and gave concerts , frequently for the benefit of refugees , or of workingclassagitators in trouble with the police ; it was damaging to the reputation of two distinguished artists , and their agent protested as much as he dared . The granddaughter of the Puritans would answer : " We do n't have to be rich . " Pretty soon she would have to retire for a while , on account of the expected baby . Lanny was a free man . He could go into New York when he pleased , and did n't have to say where he had been or whom he had met ; if he wanted to spend the night , there was nobody to worry . He could call at the office of the New Leader , have lunch with its editors in the Rand School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased . He could even go to a Communist meeting in Mecca Temple , slipping in quietly and watching the united front in action  --  not altogether perfect action , he was sad to admit . One morning he read in his newspaper that Terry Hammersmith was in town ; there was Terry 's picture , plump , with nose-glasses and the most benevolent of smiles . Lanny had n't seen this budding bureaucratsince the month of June 1919 , when they had been part of a dissident group which dined together to discuss the newly concludedtreaty of Versailles . They had to decide whether it was their duty to resign in protest against its many departures from the FourteenPoints . Terry had been one of those who made evasive speeches and decided to stay on and make the best of things ; now he wasP365having his reward , being Co-ordinator of the P.D.Q. , or whatever the alphabetical combination was which had just been formed to integrate six other assorted groups which had been stumbling over one another 's initials for the past year or two . Lanny thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Deal ! " He telephoned , and after some difficulty got the busy official on the wire , and they gave each other verbal slaps on the back . Terry must have heard about Irma Barnes , and would n't fail to be impressed . " Meet me somewhere for lunch , " said the prince consort , " and tell me about your job . " The guest was late , because he had been at an important conference . He was bubbling over with energy and enthusiasm . He was making over the world , and the happiness of many thousands depended upon his efforts ; it gave him a sense of exhilaration . Lanny got from his talk the impression that the New Deal consisted of many well-meaning persons pulling and hauling , each against the others . Terry had just emerged victorious from a titanic struggle for power . He had managed to get to the " Big Chief , " and had presentedan outline for a reorganization of his own and other bureaus . " Honestly , old man , you could have knocked me over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accepted and that I was to have full charge ! Of course the problem now is whether I can manage to persuade the others to co-operate , or whether I 'll have to get a new staff . " Lanny tried to find out what it was all about , but his friend describedso many trees that Lanny could n't get a clear idea of the forest , and was n't sure if his friend had it either . Presently he was surprised by a proposal : " Listen , old boy , why do n't you come in with us ? " " You mean , take a job ? " " I 'd be delighted to have you , and you could be tremendously useful . " " But , Terry , I have n't had any experience ! " " Very few of us have , at this kind of work . We learn as we goalong . Of course the pay is n't high , but you probably do n't need it . " " I 'm afraid I 'm not adapted to a settled job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
