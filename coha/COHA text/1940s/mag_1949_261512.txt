The Long Island Rail Road last year carried more passengers ( 109 million ) than any other road in the U.S. , yet it went bankrupt three months ago . Why ? Thousands of commuters who ride in &; out of Manhattan every day on its crowded , squalid , undependable trains have long thought that they had the answer to that question : they thought that the Pennsylvania Railroad , which owns the Long Island , drove its subsidiary on the rocks by overcharging it for services rendered and underpaying it for services received . <P> Last week the Nassau County ( N.Y. ) Transit Commission , an unsalaried board of seven prominent citizens appointed by the Republican New York State Legislature , said indignantly that the commuters were right . The Pennsy , the commission found , had milked the Long Island of upwards of $2,000,000 a year in intracompany deals . Some of the deals : The Long Island , using its own tugs and barges , hauls Pennsylvania 's freight across New York Harbor to Greenville , N.J. , earning the Pennsy $1.10 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work , the Long Island gets only 35 a ton . Thus , the Pennsy gets 75 for doing almost nothing . Said the commission : these revenues over the years would have more than wiped out the $12 million in accounts payable which the Pennsy claims is now due from the Long Island . About eleven miles of Long Island track form a vital freight route to the Brooklyn waterfront . Fees paid for use of this track by the N.Y . Connecting Railroad ( jointly owned by Pennsylvania and the New Haven ) totaled $300,000 last year , less than half of what the commission thought they should be . The Long Island owns a freight yard near Manhattan , but leases it to the Pennsy , which pays it a piddling $13,000 a year . This forces the subsidiary to deadhead its own cars to less accessible yards , at a cost last year of about $370,000 . <P> In bankruptcy , the Long Island is still being run by David E. Smucker , the chief operating officer of the road before it went broke and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week the Pennsy talked back , saying : " The commission has not . . . unearthed anything new or anything that has been kept secret by the Pennsylvania ... A complete misunderstanding of the facts . " The road also noted that the New York Public Service Commission had once said there was " little basis " for the impression that the Pennsy had been draining the Long Island . <P> <P> *Maximum penalty : $500 fine for first offense , up to $2,000 for any subsequent one . If the company is found guilty , and if it is unable to win a reversal , Standard might just as well go out of business .
