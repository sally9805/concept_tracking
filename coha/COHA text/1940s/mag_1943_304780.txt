At the White House , where he was an overnight guest , Eduard Benes got a warm welcome ; Franklin Roosevelt promptly raised to Embassy status the U.S. Legation credited to the Czech Government in London ( see p. 82 ) . Then the two Presidents sat up far into the night , ranging over the field of Central European relations . <P> Next day , in a soft voice and broken accent , Eduard Benes addressed the two Houses of Congress , recalled for his listeners Bismarck 's once-famed phrase : " Whoever is master of Bohemia is master of Europe .
