Suddenly the after-dinner music in Pennsylvania Republican politics last week became as harmonious as Bach 's Well-Tempered Clavichord . For the first time in 14 years or so , the quartet of Pew , Grundy , Martin and Davis was singing as one . The Irreconcilables had reconciled . But on no ear did the music fall sweeter than on that of handsome , handshaking Senator James John Davis . Puddler Jim was in the luck again . <P> For months Pennsylvania 's Old Guard made no secret of its intent to scuttle Puddler Jim at the polls in the April party primary . The party 's moneybags , Manufacturer Joe Grundy and Oilman Joe Pew , have a long-standing distaste for Puddler Jim . Only two years ago , 6-ft . Soldier Edward Martin and Puddler Jim were exhausting the vocabulary of political innuendo at each other in the race for Pennsylvania 's Governorship . But last week Governor Martin had Puddler Jim over to dinner at the gloomy , gabled Governor 's Mansion . They signed a truce . Puddler Jim , faced with fighting alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support ; to Old Guard horror , he had even been making cooing noises at Wendell Willkie . Unchecked , such mavericking might disrupt the Old Guard 's cozy desire to send an uninstructed ( i.e. , anti-Willkie ) delegation to the Republican convention . Messrs . Pew , Martin , and Grundy took stock of the situation . Their arms extended , they welcomed back Puddler Jim , not because they loved him more , but because they love disunion less . <P> Once again , Puddler Jim Davis ' long and unspectacular career in office had been saved by merciful intervention . After serving through three Republican Presidents as Secretary of Labor , he was off the public payroll only 33 minutes in 1930 - long enough to be sworn in as Senator . In 1932 he was re-elected two years before the New Deal tide really began to run in Pennsylvania . In 1938 he came back when the New Deal tide was ebbing and his Democratic opposition was split . Each time he won without the support of the State G.O.P. machine . Each time Pennsylvania 's two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another six-year wait to bash Puddler Jim . <P> Perhaps their new harmony song stuck in the throats of Messrs . Pew and Grundy . But Puddler Jim 's Welsh tenor came crashing through . He sang triumphantly last week : " I am willing to be a candidate for re-election . "
