txt Realization of Danger To THE EDITOR OF THE NE W YORK TIMES : It seems remarkable , by contrast with Europe , that the American people have advanced so far in their understanding of the actual peril confronting us . Much as we hope to keep out of the conflict , we are becoming more concerned with keeping the war out of the Americas . At a town meeting of the air , once Senator Brooks had admitted our danger if Britain fell , he seemed to have difficulty in defending his thesis against convoying American supplies to Europe . " What is the navy for , " asked a quietvoiced lady , " if not to take the risks necessary for our defense ? " Underneath it , though not clearly brought out , seemed the realization of the fact that " shooting our way into Europe 's bloody conflict " is not half so serious as the danger that this conflict may shoot its way over here . ROBERT R. REED . New York , April 4 , 1941.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
