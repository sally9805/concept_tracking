With a baseball Barnum 's flair for profitable hokum , Bill Veeck touched a match to Lou Boudreau 's old contract , and grinned while the flames consumed it . Then 31-year-old Lou Boudreau signed a new , two-year contract as player-manager of the Cleveland Indians . Neither Boudreau nor the Indians ' President Veeck was telling the exact salary , but they encouraged guesses of about $65,000 a year . <P> The new salary was a big boost over Boudreau 's 1948 pay of $52,000 , and ( according to Veeck ) " by far the largest straight salary ever offered a player by the club . " * But Lou had earned it with his spectacular triple performance-as the American League 's best shortstop , its best hitter ( .355 ) after Boston 's Ted Williams , and manager of the league and world 's champions . President Veeck threw in a handsome admission : " Sure , I tried to trade the guy off in 1947 . But the fans would n't stand for it . . . So Boudreau made up his mind then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he did . " <P> In St. Louis , ex-Postmaster General Bob Hannegan stepped down last week after little more than a year as president of the Cardinals , and sold out to his partner for a rumored $1,000,000 . The new president and majority stockholder ( 90% ) : Fred M. Saigh Jr. , 43 , St. Louis lawyer and big-time real-estate operator . Said Saigh : " I have decided there is no mystery about baseball . It 's just like any other business ; you have to have experts in all departments . " <P> * But not the biggest income . On a salary-bonus arrangement , Pitcher Bob Feller made $82,000 last year . Feller ( who won 19 , lost 15 in a disappointing 1948 season ) was still dickering with Veeck over his 1949 contract .
