The village of Een ( pop . 900 ) used to be just another quiet hamlet in the northern Netherlands . By last week Een had become a bustling mecca for 1,500 once desperate , now hopeful people . Bicycles were stacked up against a lilac tree in the village ; cars from every Dutch province thronged the narrow main road . Rich or poor , they all came to be treated by Een 's Wonderkapper ( miracle barber ) , who grows hair on bald heads . <P> Een 's famous barber is Marinus van Rooijen , 49 , who attributes his success to a secret fluid . His first patient was a young farmer named Klaas Tolner , who now has three inches of gleaming blond hair on his once egg-bald pate . " It 's been cut three times already , " Klaas grinned last week . " Now the girls will look at me again . " <P> Another young farmer named Derek Naves has a promising stubble after four months of treatment . Derek lives in Vars-seveld , 75 miles from Een . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts his arduous pilgrimage-an hour by bike , an hour by bus , two hours by train , another half-hour by bus , and then a last 20 minutes on the bike . Twenty-nine bald and bewigged girls , taking van Rooijen 's treatments , have sought out household jobs in Een . As a result Een , unlike the rest of Holland , has no servant shortage . <P> Van Rooijen charges 350 guilders ( $132 ) for a course of treatments . He does not claim success in every case ; he promises to refund the fee ( less 1 guilder per treatment for the first six weeks ) if , after a year , there is no " clearly visible " growth of hair . The procedure is to brush the patient 's scalp , apply the secret fluid , then brush the scalp again . Van Rooijen will not allow an analysis of his formula by Dutch medical men , who are skeptical of his claims. * If the doctors want to see results , says the barber sharply , let them look at his customers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager baldheads abroad that van Rooijen 's wife has started a stamp collection . The barber already has seven girls helping him in the shop at Een . Later this month he plans to branch out ; his son will open a ten-chair shop in Amsterdam . <P> Says Miss Annie , one of the girls helping van Rooijen : " Who would have thought men were so vain ? " <P> <P> * In the U.S. , which has about 10 million bald or balding men , leading dermatologists say that the condition has many causes , some known , some not , some curable , some not . For ordinary baldness in which the hair follicles die , they say the best " cure " is a toupee or wig . For baldness due to trichotillomania ( the compulsion to tear the hair out ) , the best cure is to stop tearing the hair out .
