txt WASHINGTON , Feb. 2 ? Secretary of State Acheson in effect rejected today the latest unofficial proposal of Premier Stalin for a " peace " conference with President Truman behind the Iron Curtain , at least on the basis on which it has been presented . The present basis , Mr. Acheson intimated , suggested an " international political maneuver " with the grave issue of peace . In reacting to the Stalin proposal , which was made in the form of ? answers to questions propounded by Kingsbury Smith , European general manager of the International News Service , Mr. Acheson indicated that , even if a worthwhile basis should develop , Mr. Truman would not again go " halfway around the world " to confer with Mr. Stalin . He also declared flatly that the United States would not engage in any " peace " negotiations with Russia that left out other interested nations . " The United States , " he said , " would not discuss with any nation any matter of direct interest to other nations without the participation of the representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or startling statement . " Mr. Acheson made his observations to a crowded news conference . In sum , he took the position that Mr. Stalin had presented no real issues for settlement in the light of the record and of Russia 's past performances and that , therefore , no new or realistic basis for negotiations had been offered . Further , he stressed ? that the United Nations , the Council of Foreign Ministers and other agencies already existed for such purposes as Premier Stalin envisaged . He particularly emphasized that // no official communication on the subject had been received and that nothing would be considered here on the basis of a press interview . If any proposal were made through proper official channels to settle the Berlin problem , he said , the United States and the other Western powers would " of course " consider it carefully " consistent with their commitments and consistent with their rights , their duties and their obligations as occupying powers . " From this standpoint he was regarded as having kept the door open for possible future developments , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left any Presidential comment to Mr. Truman himself , I Secretary Acheson assured his listeners that his views were " not contrary " to those of the President . Mr. Truman will hold his weekly news conference tomorrow . All that the White House would say today was to reiterate through Charles G. Ross , Presidential press secretary , that the President would be pleased to see Mr. Stalin here at any time . No Enthusiasm for Visit to Stalin At the Capitol such comment as there was presented no fixed picture except that there was no enthusiasm for the President to go to meet the Soviet Premier in Russia , Poland or Czechoslovakia . Secretary Acheson came to his news conference prepared to discuss the Stalin proposals and anticipated questions concerning them with an oral presentation of what clearly was a carefully prepared statement . In so doing , he stressed the devotion of the United States to peace , while at the same time he analyzed the proposals to show that they constituted " a matter so tenuous that it defies specific statement . " His remarks were dotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibility for the cause of peace , he said that nothing " except the preservation of our country and its liberties " was " more fundamental and sacred . " " The interest of the United States and of all the hundreds of millions of people through the world in peace , " he declared , " is so fundamental that the matter of peace can not be tampered with and it can not be used as an instrument in any international political maneuver . It will not be so used by the United States . " As for Premier Stalin 's announced inability for reasons of health to travel far , he remarked drily that Mr. Stalin seethed " to be grounded . " Speaks for Understanding In taking up the Stalin proposals . point by point Mr. Acheson remarked that , given " a desire to solve these problems there is no great difficulty about it . " He analyzed the proposals , he explained , because he considered it important for " the people to understand . " The first point , for " consideration of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , " he said he found puzzling and upon study " a triumph of caution . " The United bcates , Russia and all other members of the United Nations , he pointed out , are pledged by the Charter against resorting to war . Moreover , President Truman in his inaugural address gave " unfaltering " support to the United Nations . " So far as commitments and the solemn pledged word are concerned , " Mr. Acheson said , " I thought we had passed the point ' at which this answer of Stalin to the press question seems to stick . " On the second point , in which Premier Stalin said " naturally " Russia would be prepared to cooperate with the United States in measures for implementing a peace pact leading to general disarmament , Mr. Acheson said : " ' Naturally ' means ' in the nature of things , ' and in the past three years these have not been encouraging . " He mentioned efforts for peace in the United Nations , stressed the " precipitate " demobilization of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia with her " frustrating " vetoes and her " obstruction " to the creation of an international armed force " that would give authority to the United Nations . " But of all the proposals , the Secretary of State considered " the most interesting " the one for the Western Powers to postpone establishment of the Western German State and the Foreign Ministers to meet on the German problem , with Russia being prepared to lift the Berlin blockade if the Allies lifted their transport and trade restrictions in Germany . On this point he recalled the long months to achieve a settlement with Russia , the fact that the Berlin question was still on the agenda of the Security Council and the fact that a German government had not yet been formed , although preparatory work for it was going forward . All this time , he continued , the Western Powers have repeatedly said that these measures do not preclude an agreement on Germany as a whole and that what is lbeing ? done is purely provisional . As for the Allies lifting their restrictions , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Berlin blockade were . lifted , then the counter-measures would be lifted .
