For 72 hours last week the Army had a lost battalion and 700 members of the 40th Infantry were glad there were no Germans around to make things worse . Even without that they agreed with Sherman . <P> The losing happened in the Deep River wilderness of southwest Washington , into which the battalion marched briskly one night on Blue Army maneuvers . In those unfrequented wilds , maps proved almost worthless ; compasses led them into blind alleys . Rain poured down almost constantly . Cigarets ran out . Food supplies ran low ( even though eked out with berries and crawfish ) . One man broke his arm ; practically everyone had torn uniforms , wrecked shoes , bruises , scratches . <P> Seventy two hours later they saved themselves with an old woodsman 's trick - finding water , going doggedly downstream until they stumbled out of the wilderness .
