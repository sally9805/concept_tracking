For hundreds of years , Paris ' chiffoniers ( rag pickers ) had shuffled about quietly in the half-light before dawn , pawing through potato peels and rotten meat in their quest for a handful of old rags or an empty tin can . ( Their . reward : for a kilo of rags , 4 francs ; for a kilo of iron , half a franc . ) <P> Fortnight ago , the chiffoniers ran into trouble . Prefect of Police Charles Luizet had signed a health and anti-rat measure : " It is forbidden for persons to rummage in garbage cans on the streets . " <P> Next day , an anguished howl was heard across Paris . The chiffoniers cried thatthe Prefect was out to rob 50,000 people of their honest work . Several thousand gathered in cramped , dim-lit Jean Jaurs Hall to hear stooped , 63-year-old Ren Cormaud , who " does " the rue des Ecoles and the rue Monge , defend chiffonage . Said Cormaud : " It 's those fly-by-nights who cause all the trouble . They have no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a burlap sack to sort it out , they dump the garbage helter-skelter on the sidewalk . That way they give the profession a bad name . " <P> The Paris press took up the cry , pointed out that the chiffoniers collect on an average each day 400 tons of paper , 200 tons of rags and 50 tons of leather , rubber , bones , iron , tin . copper and lead . <P> Prefect Luizet felt the ground swell of sympathy for Paris chiffoniers , and annulled his directive . Declared one of the reprieved entrepreneurs : " What we want . to keep above all else is our liberty . You understand ? We want to be our own bosses . "
