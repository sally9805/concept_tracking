One night last month the managing editor of the Boston Herald got a longdistance call from Reporter Alan Frazer , speaking from one of the Canadian maritime provinces . Reporter Frazer 's voice was excited , muffled , guarded . Said he : " You wo n't hear from me for a couple of weeks or so , but do n't worry . I 've got a surprise for you , and it will be good . I ca n't talk about it because a censor is standing over my shoulder . " Then he hung up quickly . Not a word since then has Managing Editor Robert Choate heard from Reporter Frazer himself . But from the British and Canadian Governments and the U. S. State Department , he has heard plenty . <P> A couple of days after his phone call , Reporter Frazer , accompanied by another Canadian censor , went to visit a convoy ship shortly before its sailing time . The censor , preparing to descend to the pilot boat , looked for Reporter Frazer . He was missing . The ship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safely at sea , Reporter Frazer appeared as a stowaway . He had figured that British naval authorities would laugh off his stunt as a smart newspaper scoop , play ball with him in order to cash in on the romantic publicity .
