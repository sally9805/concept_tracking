txt WASHINGTON , March 22 ? The war may be decided by riveting hammers and welding torches . Draftsmen bent above blueprints and ship 's lines laid out on loft floors now epitomize the nature of the struggle . It is a war of attrition , and shipping is its most important single factor . German submarines , planes , surface raiders and mines increase the rate of sinking to well over 100,000 tons a week . The British , confident in their new - found strength in the air , mince no words in emphasizing that shipping is their greatest need . And from all departments of the United States Government comes the cry for more ships ? ships for the Army and for the Navy , ships to carry strategic raw materials , ships to transport materials for our island bases , ships for hemisphere trade , ships without which life as we now know it is not possible . A Growing Strain There are many who are in high authority here who believe that the outcome of the war depends upon the ability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of British , allied and neutral merchant shipping have been lost in more than eighteen months of war . The weekly average is somewhat more than 66,000 tons ; the monthly around 270,000 . The trend is now upward ; Britain must reckon upon a loss of between 3,500,000 and 5,500,000 tons of British , neutral and allied shipping during 1941 . And both the British Empire and the United States combined will not produce more than about 2,100,000 tons of merchant shipping this year . Thus , both nations enter upon the most critical year of the war without replacement capacity sufficient to meet the anticipated losses at sea . A Tremendous Problem This is the problem and it is a tremendous one . But it is greatly complicated by the problem of building naval vessels as well as merchant ships . Without building naval ships to guard them , the replacement of merchant vessels is like pouring water down a bottomless hole . We have 446 ocean-going naval vessels of more than 2,500 , - 000 tons , to cost $7,000,000,000 under construction , in addition to 312 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district craft and 1,404 small boats . And the problem is further complicated by the necessity for repair and overhaul of shipping ; for every two ships sunk at least one may be damaged . Moreover , the convoy system materially slows down the between - port passages of ships ; the bombings materially delay their loading ; one ship carries considerably fewer loads than in peacetime . With most of Europe in German hands the British sources of supply are now much farther away . This is the problem and its seriousness can scarcely be too much emphasized . It is a problem of world shipping ? not narrowly of British shipping , of American and Dutch and Danish shipping . For it is world shipping that is being decreased . There may actually be more shipping under British control today than when the war started . She started the war with some 19,000 , - 000 tons ; she has acquired , chartered , seized , bought or leased between 7,000,000 and 9,000,000 tons ; the actual British loss is only about 3,000,000 out of the 5,000,000 tons sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled by foreign bottoms before the war began ; today the German and Italian ships are enemies ; United States carriers no longer ply to Britain . And the United States merchant fleet has been depleted to supply Britain ; when the war started we possessed 8,177,704 tons of oceangoing merchant vessels ( of 1,000 gross tons and over ) ; on Dec. 31 last we had 7,279,196 tons , or 1,233 ships . We built 473,000 tons in 1939-40 ; we transferred or sold to Britain , 1,371,896 tons . Moreover , our own mobilization and preparations have required the acquisition of very considerable tonnage by the Army and Navy ; the Army has bought seventeen vessels ; the Navy has acquired forty-five vessels , totaling some 630,000 tons  --  more than we built in the first fifteen months of the war . Our Needs and Britain 's The lease-lend act has virtually made us an ally of Britain ; we have agreed to give Britain all possible aid short of war ; therefore the British and American shipping fleets must be considered as units ; upon some 27,000,000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . In Britain the major problem is one of supply . If she can not maintain a " bridge of ships " across the Atlantic she dies ; if she can not maintain a bridge of ships through the Mediterranean and around the Cape through Suez , and across the island-studded Aegean , she must withdraw her troops from North Africa and Greece or meet defeat . Already there are evidences that the British effort in the Balkans has been and must be governed to a certain extent by the availability of shipping for supply . And in Britain itself rationing restrictions are gradually being tightened . Our problem is actual and potential . It is actual in that we do not today have enough shipping under our flag plying to the Far East or to South America to carry the strategical materials such as tin and rubber and manganese that are vital to our war effort . The Norwegian freighters on the South American run now carry some of these materials ; if they are withdrawn the problem is further accentuated . Scarcity of Cargo Space There is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; freight shipments are sometimes booked months in advance . And to handle the materials required for development and construction of our new bases perhaps some sixty ships ( or 1,000 shiploads ) will be required in the next fifteen months . If we engage in war on one or two oceans , or undertake a further mobilization of our resources , the Army and Navy alone may requisition anywhere from 25 to 90 per cent of the 400 or so ships now engaged in foreign commerce .. And to carry the materials to be leased or lent or sold or given to Britain still further ships are needed . These are the problems that are already evident . The solutions are several : ( 1 ) Ship construction . The production of the British Empire under present conditions can not be expected much to exceed 1,000 , - 000 gross tons a year . In the United States as of March 1 there were 451 merchant vessels of about 3,500,000 gross tons under construction or contracted for in fifty-one American yards , which possessed 119 shipbuilding ways , with 143 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these vessels of 1,950,000 tons are to be ships of simple and crude design with reciprocating engines and slow speeds , ships of the emergency program ; the rest represent vessels in the regular Maritime Commission program or building for private account . It is hoped that practically all of these vessels will be in service by the ' end of 1942 , but only about 1,000 , - 000 tons will be ready this year , with the shipyards ' output  --  if all Expansion of Building ( 2 ) Expansion of the present program . Under the lease-lend bill some $629,000,000 is earmarked for ships . No plans as to how this will be spent have yet been made public , but it is believed that perhaps 200 ships or even twice that number may be added to the present emergency program , thus virtually doubling it . Even so , , some experts here do not believe that much more than 1,000,000 tons of merchant ships can be turned out this year , and mid-1943 is set as the date when a production rate of some 5,000,000 gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Transfer of ships already built from the United States flag to the British flag . Some experts feel that , despite our own severe need for shipping , perhaps 130 to 160 vessels engaged in intercoastal or coastwise trade might be transferred to Britain . Some small amount of the 2,200,000 tons on the Great Lakes might also be so shifted , although the limiting factor here is the bottleneck of the Welland Canal and the necessity of retaining as many ore carriers on the Lakes as possible to meet what is expected to be a recordbreaking ore season . The burden of the coastwise trade would have to be met by the railroads . Seizure of Ships ( 4 ) Seizure of the 589,000 tons of Danish , French , German and Italian ships now in our ports and their utilization in the carrying trade . ( 5 ) Greater coordination of shipping effort and virtual establishment of priorities for cargoes . Under some such system , wasteful competition might be eliminated ; the banana trade , which utilizes a great tonnage , might suffer ; but rubber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and unneeded Philippine sugar would fill cargo bottoms . The problem is manifold and complex ; the solutions equally difficult ; in brief they sum up to a vast speed-up and expansion of the shipbuilding program , and the appointment of a " czar " to control all American shipping and to coordinate the shipping of the democracies . Even this may not meet 1941 's needs , but the sooner this is done the more likely the year 's needs are to be met. goes well  --  approaching 400,000 Maintenance of Menaced Life Line a tons in the last quarter , and Titanic Task for Her and U.
