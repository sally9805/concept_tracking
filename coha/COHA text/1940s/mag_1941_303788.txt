With the aid of a Russian-born tenor , Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts has acquired a million-dollar gift in the form of a collection of its own choosing . The museum , already the possessor of one of the best public collections of early American arts and crafts , has for six years been helping Patron Maxim Karolik pick up the best American antiques in the 13 original colonies . <P> Not very successful as a tenor , furrow-browed , gesticulating Vocalist Karolik 13 years ago married Martha Codman , a member of one of Boston 's best families , whose personal fortune was estimated at five million . Installed in a marble mansion in Newport , Karolik , inspired by the workmanship displayed in his wife 's inherited family relics , decided to make early American antiques his hobby . Badly needing advice , he made a deal with the Boston Museum of Fine Arts : they should guide and direct him in making purchases , he would present the completed collection to the museum . <P> Never had any of Boston 's own sons so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of the oldest families , the museum 's Decorative Arts Curator Edwin James Hipkiss and Collector Karolik knocked on doors from New Hampshire to Georgia , rooted out many an old desk , clock , silver tankard , portrait . While Curator Hipkiss pointed out good and bad features , Collector Karolik asked questions , absorbed information . To old New England and Philadelphia matrons , startled at the idea of selling American antiquity to a man with a Russian accent , they explained that every piece would go to the Boston Museum . Says Donor Karolik : " About the things that happened collecting you could write a vaudeville . " <P> For last fortnight 's opening 350 pieces had been brought together , studied , documented and installed in a new wing built jointly by Karolik and the museum . Massachusetts ' Governor Leverett Saltonstall headed a long list of Back Bay notables who gathered to gaze and admire . But Maxim Karolik was not there . He had slipped out a back door as the distinguished guests walked in the front entrance . " I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karoliks should not go to the opening , " he explained . " It iss better that the collection should shine by its own glory . " <P> Connoisseurs looked approvingly at tankards functionally designed in 1700 by Silversmiths David Jesse and John Coney , clucked with admiration over Gilbert Stuart and John Singleton Copley portraits . Loudest praise was brought forth by the results of Donor Karolik 's greatest hobby , 18th-Century furniture . Some experts from New York , Chicago , Philadelphia and New England pronounced it second only to the huge ( 148 rooms ) private collection of Wilmington 's Henry F. du Pont . Each of the 125 exhibits showed the care in selection which Karolik had considered so necessary .
