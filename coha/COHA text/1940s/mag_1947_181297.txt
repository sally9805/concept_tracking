The Communists got a hard kick in the pants from voters in what had long been one of Communism 's Canadian strongholds . The scene was Montreal 's Cartier riding , which had elected a Communist to the Dominion House of Commons the last two times it voted . In a by-election this week , to fill a vacancy left by the imprisonment of Communist and Traitor Fred Rose , a seat in the House was won by Liberal Maurice Hartt , a self-made lawyer who once sewed buttonholes for a living . <P> It was a resounding triumph . Running in a crowded field ( six candidates in all ) plump , 42-year-old Maurice Hartt ran thousands of votes ahead of both Independent Paul Masse and Communist Michael Buhay . The fact that the Liberal Party 's best bilingual orators journeyed over from Ottawa for the windup of a slam-bang campaign , helped . But Winner Hartt almost surely owed his victory most of all to the electorate 's change of mind about Communism . The Hartt victory also indicated approval of the Federal Government 's handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party , the Hartt victory was desperately needed . It strengthened the thin Liberal majority in the House of Commons ( now 127 seats against 117 for the combined Opposition ) . It also seemed to indicate a brightened party future . The Liberals , after three by-election defeats in a row , now had won two straight ( in Cartier and in Riche-lieu-Verchres last December ) . In Ottawa , Liberal masterminds sighed with relief .
