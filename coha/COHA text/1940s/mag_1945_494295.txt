London Letter by Bruce Bliven THE BACK-BENCH US . ? A close view shows that the present Labor government is more divided internally than as seen from New York . It is an ominous sign when Mr. Bevin , as Foreign Minister , makes a speech with a rather anti-Russian flavor which is loudly cheered by the Conservatives who are nomi ? nally his opponents , and received in dead silence by the back-benchers ( the rank-and-file members ) of his own party 's overwhelming majority in the House . These back-benchers are by no means all trade-union spokesmen and lifelong members of the working class , as one might suppose . On the contrary , a large part of them are young people from the middle class with a strong radical bent , which they acquired , more often than not , at one of the universities , especially Oxford or Cambridge . They are getting increasingly restive under the continued pursuit of a foreign policy which in general , so they feel , is indistinguishable from that of the coalition government supposedly repudiated in the July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-Russian , with an emotional loyalty that is rather reminiscent of the feeling that was widespread in the United States 15 or 20 years ago . Others feel that their attitude is less one of simple enthusiasm for the USSR than fear that the world is being divided into hostile camps , and an anxiety that people in the West should understand the Russian point of view about , for example , Franco , Greece and the atomic bomb . Whether these back-benchers , some of whom may in fact be the front-benchers of the cabinet before very long , are actually anti-American , is a question that is hotly debated in London . They are certainly in warm accord with American progressivism as represented by Henry Wallace and the CIO-PAC and affiliated groups . They seem to show an increasing skepticism about President Truman , Secretary Byrnes and the recent drift of Washington policy . Occasionally you meet someone who says that a socialist economy like Great Britain 's must not tie itself to a land of con ? servative " free enterprise " such as the United States predominantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Labor government calls for socializing only a few industries , most of them domestic in their activities , and there is such great scope left for individual busi ? ness activity that the problem hardly seems insur ? mountable . If some of the Labor back-benchers felt Britain should not ratify Bretton Woods , others argued that the wisest course is to ratify and then proceed to plan ahead to sterilize the effects of another disastrous American depression , if we insist on having one . A Hard Life in the Commons . ? Compared with the conditions for a member of Parliament , American con ? gressmen lead lives of luxury . The MP gets a salary of only $2,400 per year , subject to income tax of $z , 000 and an expense for postage which may easily equal $400 per year . He gets an insignificant sum for traveling expenses , but has no office of any kind ; he gets his mail by standing in line in front of a letter rack where he shares his box with all other MP 's whose names begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London are facing a housing shortage even worse ( if possible ) than that in Wash ? ington . The members ' restaurant in the House serves fairish food at controlled prices , but some of the new Labor members are poor men who find even these prices rather high , and for them , an inexpensive cafe ? teria has been opened on a lower floor . As might be expected , the working-class constituents of the new Labor members feel closer to them than has been cus ? tomary with MP 's in the past ; and the result is an unprecedented , overwhelming flood of mail asking all sorts of advice : how to get someone out of the army , how to get a license for house repairs or to buy furni ? ture , how to get released from a job in a war factory to which one is " frozen . " Many of the members , as a result of all these problems , appear to be getting over ? tired ? a fact which might affect their judgment . Planning New Towns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England can do these days is to look at the remarkable new plans for many of the cities and towns ? London , Manchester , Bristol , Cov ? entry , Plymouth . Several of them have been issued in book form , replete with handsome illustrations . Not all of them have been officially adopted as yet ; the English style is to put out the plan just as it comes from the drawing boards of the experts , and get the public reaction , before letting official authorities ( who are sometimes affected by special private interests , just as with us ) get to work on it . It is safe to say , however , that nearly all the plans will be adopted without veil serious departures from the present outlines . The blitz destroyed so many buildings in so many places that resistance to the new ideas is far less than it would otherwise have been . The chief feature of all these plans is a " green belt " around the city , consisting of many square miles 01 parks or farmlands , owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private interest . Some of these green belts already exist in large part : London , for instance , has bought thou DECEMBER 17 , 1945 sands of acres toward such a project . Other important items are two or more concentric , high-speed , circular parkways to carry traffic rapidly around the congested central areas , numerous small , new parks scattered everywhere , and new housing developments planned as a unit . The fundamental group would be about 2,000 families , living in sufficient isolation from other units to give a sense of community ; each group would have its own schools , stores and so on . In practice , of course , there are great deviations from this scheme . Some of these plans are criticized by professional experts because they provide for housing involving 50 , Icio or even more persons per acre , instead of 30 or 35 . Why , the experts ask , make plans now which are inferior to the best that is already known ? Why create what will be looked upon in a few years ' time as overcrowded areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions ? Others answer them by arguing for " skyscrapers set in parks " which would enable large numbers of people to live in close prox ? imity to their jobs , or they point to the terrible condi ? tions to be faced in London because of existing land values , etc . Whatever the facts may be about this , it is certainly true that in their general sweep and imagi ? native daring , the new city plans are many years in advance of anything seriously brought forward in the United States , except perhaps the Norman Bel Geddes scheme for Toledo . These new plans , of course , will not be fully realized for many years . It is not proposed to tear down large masses of existing and useful buildings in order to build anew on the sites . Once the plan has been ac ? cepted , however , any property which comes into the market will be used only as the plan suggests . GI University . ? One of the oddities of British life this autumn has been a full-fledged American univer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Shrivenham , near Oxford , buildings erected a few years ago for a Royal Artillery school were taken over by the American Army and plans put through to give some soldiers at least a taste of university life . Each group has consisted of about 4,000 men , who must have completed a high-school education ; actually a large part of them had done some college work before they went into the Army . They are chosen on a per ? percentage basis from units in the European theatre ; the men apply for permission to go , and their commanding officers must agree . Each course is eight weeks , but the instructors say that the men are so serious and work so hard that the result is the equivalent of a full semes ? ter at home . The man who gets a satisfactory grade in any subject is given a certificate with the hope and expectation that if he goes to a university when he returns home , he will receive credit toward a degree . The subjects to be taught were selected after study ? ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In general , the courses are those that are standard in the United States ? history , languages , philosophy , economics . There is a heavy trend toward agricultural training and an extraordinary degree of interest in journalism . The three hundred members of the faculty are all American college professors , some of them ? like Frank Dobie of Texas , for example ? well known . Each took a year 's leave of absence from his own institution . With a degree of initiative that left British observers gasping , the GI students at Shrivenham overnight organized a vast complex of extracurricular activities ? all types of athletics , journalism , a jazz band , a sym ? phony orchestra , a little theatre , a college paper , a low-powered student radio broadcasting station . In fact , a few hours on the campus would convince anyone that he was at the University of Iowa , or Nebraska , or Kan ? sas , were it not for one sole English touch : the cars drive on the wrong side of the road . Having started all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped it with equal suddenness . After only 16 weeks , Shrivenham is to be closed down at once , and three smaller , separate institutions in Ger ? many will take its place . No Planes . ? During the war we used to hear a lot about the age of aviation which would follow . To several thousand Americans and others in London in October and November , that was a rather sour joke . Airplane service across the ocean was at a very low minimum ? only a few planes per week . The daily press has reported in detail the difficulties encountered by Pan-American Airways when it tried to fly passen ? gers across the ocean at a fare lower than was accept ? able either to competing American lines or to the British Overseas Airways Corporation . For this and 83 6 other reasons , the waiting lists of would-be airplane passengers in London have mounted into many hun ? dreds . Indeed , the struggle to get to America either by air or by sea is a heartbreaking one . Thousands of United States citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thousands more from every other country are engaged , even more hopelessly , in the same effort . This writer is coming home in a 3,500-ton cargo ship from Glasgow as one of eight men in a cabin designed for two , and lucky to get the chance . Heartbreaking is the plight of the British brides of GI 's who are being left behind while their hus ? bands go home to be demobilized . I talked the other day with the chairwoman of their committee , who ex ? plained the situation without bitterness but with a cer ? tain sense of urgency . " There are 54,000 of us in Britain alone , " she said . " Already we have had 20,000 babies , and many more are on the way . Most of our husbands have gone home or will do so soon . Many of them have been ' de ? mobbed , ' ca n't find work , and are unable to send their wives any money , family allowances of course being stopped when a man leaves the Army . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , so soon after marriage ; and the babies of course are all American citizens . We know that transport is diffi ? cult ; but we read about American ships being laid up in the Hudson River , and it upsets us . " the NEW REPUBLIC A Walk ' Round Southampton . ? For this reporter , his first impression of postwar England remains his most vivid one . A mild October evening with a young moon hanging mistily overhead , looking down on streets terribly devastated in the blitz ; houses and rows of houses completely demolished , or with mere shells standing so that you look in through gaping windows at great heaps of rubble extending as high as the ceil ? ing . To save coal , the street lighting is at a minimum ; you can just grope your way along . There is almost no wheeled traffic , and in the hush you hear the sturdy tramp of hundreds and hundreds of American GI 's walking out with Southampton girls , clutching each other firmly around the waist , as though , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young male and female with such different back ? grounds . Most of the Southampton boys with whom those girls should be walking out ? or more probably hav ? ing a dish of tea by the stove in the kitchen ? are in barracks on the Rhine , or farther off still , assuming that they are still alive . The American girls with whom these GI 's should be having a coke at the drugstore after the second show at the movie , are at all-female parties or out with ? as the Southampton GI sees it ? the wrong man . . ? . The more you think about it , the more you are convinced that a global war is a bad idea .
