Anderson , to supervise Government operation , hailed the action of the CIO union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national interest . " " With the cooperation of management and labor now assured , we can get meat back into the market within a matter of days , " he added . We need meat , and all plants should be back in full operation as quickly as possible . At the same time it is very important that all shippers check with their agents before starting shipment . Marketing must be orderly , with shipments in line with plant capacities in order to avoid gluts . " The CIO union voted yesterday to stay out , charging that the seizure order was " a complete double-cross " because it did not contain a provision for putting into effect the recommendations of the fact-finding board which is con // sidering the wage dispute . Such a provision , union , officials said , had been promised " by high Governmental officials . " Countermanding yesterday 's decision , the union said : " We have received from the Secretary of Agriculture , in a telegram sent from Washington at 8:24 P. M. Friday , assurances which we understand to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's Cabinet of the United States that he will use his high office to insure justice and equity for the packinghouse workers . He has assured us that he will take the necessary steps to make effective the . report of the fact-finding panel . " Report Expected in Two Weeks The procedure provided by law is for the seizing agency to apply to the Wage Stabilization Board for approval of any wage changes .

We solicit their continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the packinghouse workers . " We desire that it be clearly understood that the return to work under these circumstances will be for a sufficient period to enable the Government to comply with its commitments . We , of course , reserve the right in the final analysis crease made effective pursuant to the Secretary of Agriculture 's telegram will be a substantial increase meeting the family needs of the workers ' of this industry , taking into account the low level of packinghouse workers ' wages . And in this connection we expect that retroactive payments will be forthcoming .

He said that relationship was destroy d by War Labor Board decision in February , 1943 . " We should not be penalized for adherence to a no-strike pledge , " Mr. Helstein argued . He introduced an exhibit designed to show a relationship for twenty-five years , with meat packing wage rates somewhat above the rates paid by the United States Steel Corporation . The exhibit being on the up side in relation to meat packing , Mr. Helstein stressed that President Truman had proposed a steel wage increase of 181,2 cents an hour . He said the meat workers ' last general increase was in August , 1941 . The CIO packinghouse union is asking an increase of 25 cents an hour , 171/2 cents of it now and the rest to be negotiated later . It has settled with some small packers for 15 cents . The largest offer from the big packers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensurate price relief for every cent of wage increase . Contention of a Large Packer Swift &; Co. counsel took issue with the union 's contention , declaring that the War Labor deleted 1 line any relationship between steel and meat wages was limited to Chicago and that there was no relationship above common labor'rates . The lawyer also emphasized that the union exhibits dealt with the industry as a whole , whereas the fact-finding , board was limited to the circumstances of individual companies involved in the dispute . The UPW also entered an exhibit to show that the return on net worth in the meat products industries was 7.5 per cent after income taxes in 1944 , compared with an average of 3.2 per cent in the years 1936 to 1939 . The union compared this with the iron and steel group 's return of 4.3 per cent in 1936-39 and 6.8 per cent in 1944 . The companies stress their earnings in terms of , percentage of sales . ' This was given as an average of 1.1 per cent a year from 1933 to 1944 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking for the other board members , Clark Kerr and Chief Justice Raymond W. Starr of the Supreme Court of Michigan , and himself , thanked all the participating companies and . unions for " excellent cooperation . " He said the board realized the importance of reaching an early decision and added that if the parties could reach an agreement among themselves the panel and the entire country would be " grateful . " Anderson Urges " Extra Licks " WASHINGTON , Jan. 26 ( U.P. ) Secretary Anderson expressed appreciation today to " all the working groups " for agreeing to return to work in meat packing plants . " I hope that every employe of the strikebound plants will put in a few extra licks these next few days to help catch up with our commitments to the armed forces and the people in other lands , " he said . " The cooperation shown by both labor and management is gratifying and greatly in the public interest .

He said there had been " interruptions of work " at the four stockyards , and he ordered the seizures to assure that they would be open for business Monday when packinghouse workers returned to work .

MIAMI , FIa. , Jan. ** for the AFL meat cutters and butcher workmen for returning to work in Government-operated meat plants was voiced today by William Green , president of the federation , who styled the action as a thoroughly wise decision in keeping with the policy of the American Federation of Labor . " " We do not believe that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " he said in commenting on official notification of the union 's action received by the executive council here . " The workers would have suffered severe loss in wage income , " he added , " whereas they can now expect that their wage dispute with the industry will be decided on its merit by the fact-finding board investigating the case and that any wage increase recommended will be made retroactive to the date of seizure . " On Monday the council instructed Mr. Green to notify all members of Congress of its opposition to Federal fact-finding boards on the ground that they tended to become , wage-fixing boards and that governmental wage-fixing would be fatal to free enterprise . " Instead of incurring widespread criticism by denying meat to soldiers stationed overseas , " Mr. Green added today , " inconveniencing our entire population and causing disastrous losses to farmers , cattle raisers and cattle feeders , the returning workers will earn the good-will and sympathy of the public .
