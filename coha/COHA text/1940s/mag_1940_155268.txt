Rosenfeld , against the Jewish , plutocratic press . The country has recently become acquainted too with the distorted echoes these cries make when they bounce off Rome 's walls . Last week a strangely related fury came up from the ruins of Spain . <P> All week long newspapers attacked the U. S. This week the campaign reached a climax .
