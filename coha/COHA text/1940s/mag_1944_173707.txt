For All Americans <P> Sirs : <P> For the benefit of other civilians , I forward a message to us all from a letter written by an A.A.F. captain now flying a Liberator in the Central Pacific ; he wears the Air Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster : <P> " I want to tell you what a group of us officers and enlisted men have been talking about tonight . <P> " Though we have done a good job of killing the enemy , I find no sign of an organized hate in any of our men . . . . Our men come closer to hating those at home who break faith with us at the fronts-the shirkers , the profiteers , those who bicker in Washington over our rights . If the powers that be in America deny us in the service the right to an easy , practical way of voting , they will live to regret it . And to the last man our group js not in accord with What some people in the states are trying to do with some American citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they step out of the line of faithfulness to our country , punish them severely . But do n't touch one of them just because he has Japanese blood . They are American citizens . We are fighting for all American citizens , and when we die for them we do n't stop to ask what kind of blood they have . We are fighting for the sacred rights of man ; we do n't want them toyed with behind our backs . " <P> DONALD CULROSS PEATTIE Santa Barbara , Calif . <P> Our Mistake <P> Sirs : <P> In TIME ( March 20 ) you state that " the New Republic , non-interventionist until a few months before Pearl Harbor , shifted to reflect the views of its owner , Mrs. Leonard K. Elmhirst . U.S.-born , she has become a British citizen . . . " <P> This statement is not true . The New Republic 's action in demanding that the U.S. enter the war was solely the work of its editors . We believed that Hitler intended to conquer the world ; that as matters stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the U.S. ought to get into the conflict before Great Britain was knocked out . . ... We think now that we were absolutely right in our decision . <P> Numerous other magazines and newspapers came out in favor of entering the war just before or just after we did so . Does TIME believe that in all those cases there was improper pressure to force them to do so ? <P> Mrs. Leonard Elmhirst is not the owner of the New Republic . Ownership was transferred a number of years ago from the editors to Editorial Publications , Inc. , a New York corporation . During the whole history of the magazine no attempt has ever been made by its financial sponsors to influence the editors . When we make mistakes , as we are perfectly capable of doing , they are our own mistakes . <P> BRUCE BLIVEN <P> President New Republic New York City <P> TIME , which sometimes makes mistakes too , erred in implying that Mrs. Elmhirst , who established the trust funds which largely meet the paper 's deficit , controls the New Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
