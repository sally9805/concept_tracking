txt The Administration 's $1,314,010,000 foreign military aid program had a rough time of it in the Senate , but it has survived , and since the tale has had a happy ending we can feel relieved and dispense with recriminations . However , vigilance is still the watchword , for the House of Representatives cut the authorization for Europe in two , just as Senator George tried to do in the last few days . Now the effort must be made to induce the House to restore President Truman 's figure . The criticisms offered in the Senate this week have forearmed us . The arguments of the opponents of the bill and of those who fought for a reduction in the authorization are impressive and sincere and they are being offered by men who have the security of the United States and the defeat of communism as much at heart as those who support the Administration . There is an honest difference of opinion , but it is worth pointing out that the opposing reasons are largely based on fears of what might happen . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program would be used as " an American Maginot line " and lull us into a belief that Western Europe would fight our battles for us . Surely , it is up to us not to be misled into such a belief . Senator Dulles on Wednesday warned that each country might seek military self-sufficiency and there would be no real integration of the arms prograin . That , as he himself pointed out , is a reason to watch the implementation of the program , but not a reason to oppose it altogether or to reduce its effectiveness . In the same way , the arguments of Senator Byrd and others concerned with economy that the ultimate cost will be many billions of dollars are future bridges that can be crossed when we come to them . The criticism of dismantling in Germany made by Senator George has validity , but it is essentially a separate issue which can be tackled separately . There are powerful reasons against the strengthening of Germany at this time . The rest of Western Europe is by no means reconciled to the resurgence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that the defense of the West would be much easier if Germany were a partner in it , but the point to be made now is that too many countries do not yet trust Germany enough to rearm her . The Germans must first show that they are good Europeans and good democrats , and they must persuade their former victims that there will be no repetition of 1914 and 1939 . That goal is still a long way off , and for Americans to ignore European sentiments on the German issue is to weaken the purpose of the Military Aid Program . The answer to Senator Gillette 's fear that the program would lead to an arms race was given indirectly by Secretary of State Acheson at Lake Success on Wednesday in what must be considered a remarkable display of understatement . " There is no immediate prospect of universal agreement " on disarmament , the Secretary said . A small element of the opposition is no doubt based on isolationism and perhaps another small part would represent a failure to understand American responsibilities in a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Atlantic Pact but not to be willing to implement them in proper measure would be to fall into the tral ) that made a tragicomedy of the Kellogg-Briand Pact . If we let the Atlantic Pact go with expressions of hopes and wishes or even of determination , the countries on the other side of the Atlantic will not believe us . If we provide an inadequate sum and accompany it with our expressions of distrust and defeatism , the Pact will have at best a very uncertain future . Those whose countries , whose farms , homes and cities would be the first overrun in a war need solid proof that the United States means business . With the arms , they can not only feel stronger in a material way , but they will have a higher morale to face the dangers ahead . The M A. P. is just one more example of the things that the United States must do to fulfill its role as the champion of world freedom . We are still " the arsenal of democracy , " just as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as butter .
