l'ill  --  NTOT more than five years after I emerged from three-cornered pants , I was aware of the fact that mamma and papa were just barely ac-quainted . Nearly everything papa did astonished mamma , and continued to do so until she died at the age of seventy , although his behavior was as pre-dictable as the tides . At least I found it so . As for papa , he knew what mamma would do or think about any problem likely to confront them , but this brought no more solace than would the knowledge that the inhabitants of Mars odd two and two and get five . " Women . . . " he would say , with a tolerant smile , and he never finished the sentence . But I finished it for him . I knew what he meant . " Women are born crazy and improve with the years . " There was no bitterness . God had thus ordained it . He loved his wife and he was going to keep her , although he very often did n't like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they loved each other passionately and devotedly . All this I knew as a wriggling little tadpole in knee pants . It pained me because they were such lovely parents . Mamma was so beautiful that it was common experience for me to hear men and women of all ages remark about her , even on streetcars . And papa was all that a little boy could ask for . He was so young and healthy and eager and pleasant  --  and already he was a hero . Everywhere we went men whose names we did not know would call out ; " Hello , Billy . " He was a famous baseball pitcher . And not only could he throw curves but he could shoot guns with incredible accuracy , and run 100 yards in ten seconds , and he could get the best out of trotting horses , and he could lift a heavy oak chair , picking it up with his right hand at the bottom of one leg , raising it over his head , and replacing it , slowly and carefully , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect papa for a tadpole in twelve-inch trousers ! Nor could there have been a mamma to generate greater pride and love . Nevertheless , I knew even then that they struggled with the problem that has since come to be rather vaguely and even recklessly described as incompatibility . I am sure that it never occurred to papa that there might be another woman with whom he could live in better understanding . He judged that they were all alike . I well remember his consternation when women were granted the right to vote . " I have cast my last vote , " he said . But he recovered . He was a patriot , and I have seldom known a man more conscientious about his duty to help elect the beat candidates . He had no interest in politics except to discharge his duty as a citizen . He finally decided that if women were going to vote , the men would have to do better than ever to save the nation . Not that women were vicious , you must understand . Not grabbing . Just irresponsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would stop for ice-cream sodas or a yard of blue ribbon or lace for their panties and never arrive at the ballot boxes . They might even forget that it was election day  --  probably would . They were all crazy . But mamma , as her little boy saw her , was not crazy and not irresponsible . On the contrary , she was a most dependable person whose behavior was fixed by long and honorable tradition . The trouble was that her inherited tradition was utterly incompatible with papa 's way of life . I have often wondered why their courtship failed to disclose the fact that they were alien to each other and certain to remain so as long as they lived . Mamma was the daughter of an English portrait painter who came to Boston and there married and prospered until pneumonia ended his life in its prime . His social position was definite and his finances were always in order . He was the sort of standard Englishman who would save a little by a little and invest the savings very conservatively , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of 11 per cent in this rich country . He was no long-haired Bohemian . Mamma 's maiden name was Adelaide Chichester ; her father 's name was George Chichester , and his portraits are still treasured in the New England States . Mamma liked her tea at half past four . When servants were not available she worked like a galley slave to have the whole house glistening . No matter what the family fortunes might be , she nearly always had a piano and played a few bars of music during the afternoon or evening . She played beautifully , with ur without notes , and sang well , also , although the voice was tiny . With a needle she was a genius . She could make any sort of gown , including the most elaborate creations of velvet ; she could duplicate the finest laces , after one careful examination of the pattern ; she could make men 's shirts , and usually made my suits . They were much neater than any then obtainable in the shops . In the kitchen she was also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We resided for a year in New Orleans and thereafter a dozen or more of the best of that remarkable city 's incomparable dishes were in her repertoire . Her theory of the happy life was a modest but beautiful home among good neighbors , a pleasant dalliance with the arts , a stable income , a flower garden , a pew in the nearest Episcopal church , and ultraconservative respectability . Papa had abandoned education in grammar school , over the tearful protest of his widowed mother , because he wanted to be a professional baseball player . He was a star pitcher before he was twenty-one , drawing the incredible salary of $150 a month . His mother never quite believed that he received any such sum for throwing baseballs , and blushed whenever the subject was mentioned  --  as it often was  --  because in those days families were reared on an income of from fifty to sixty dollars a month . But papa vastly increased his income by betting on himself whenever he pitched . His salary he regarded as merely till money to finance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am sure that he regretted not being light enough to ride the horses of his choice . He loved horses and The fact that he was shunted here and there , as baseball managers juggled their personnel to get better-balanced teams , did not annoy him . He liked moving hither and yon on short notice . It was exciting ; like a picnic . I can not even recall the names or the number of cities in which 1 attended school in the primary grades , but I also liked this moving about . Mamma hated it . Without being her partisan , I understood her point of view . Papa never did . She should have known what the pattern of her life would be with him . After her father 's death , she and her mother and sixters had moved to Ohio . The two families were neighbors of long standing , Papa 's mother and his sisters warned her that she ought not to marry him . Her mother and her sisters also warned her . But she had unbounded faith in the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crowells had come from England to Cape Cod not many years after the Mayflower anchored near the rock called Plymouth . They farmed and fought Indians and built churches and worshiped God . To this good day there are more Crowella than Smiths on Cape Cod . A small colony of Crowells trekked to Ohio and there they farmed , also , and built churches and schools and huge barns and smokehouses . Whatever else they did , they were landed gentry first . But they were also scholars , ministers of the gospel , lawyers , judges , and soldiers in all our ware . This tradition matched adequately that of mamma 's family . If papa wished to play professional baseball for a while , he would inevitably return to normalcy . And she would guide him . A simple matter , as she saw it . Mamma believed implicitly in the American credo that the wife dominates the husband ; she promises to " love , honor , and obey , " but he is the one who is to obey . She knew that men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , And she was eager to undertake that responsibility . He might play baseball for a few more years , but she would guide him into maturity and he would soon become a sedate paterfamilias . Even as a tadpole , I knew he should never have married . He did not marry mamma ; mamma married him . And the perfect life she had in mind as his reward would have been , for him , a form of premature death . His blood surged hot for adventure until he died in his seventies . She never knew him . And he was a delightful gentleman . I loved him . When his best pitching days were behind him he took up managing minor-league teams , usually with a stake in the ownership . Sometimes these ventures would prosper , but usually they failed . If they prospered one year , they failed the next . Often , when his team was doing quite well , the league itself would fail , due to microscopic attendance at the ball parks of the trailing teams . These disasters always found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was an incurable optimist to whom life 's slings and arrows were fun . She wanted security , and that was the last thing on earth he wanted . He could have had that before they were married by the simple course of taking over the management of the family estate , an enormous farm whose fertile acres are now within the city limits of present-day Cincinnati , Ohio . And , strangely , he was well qualified for the management of that farm . He not only knew how to plant and harvest and sell the crops but he could build a wagon , make harness , cure meat and hay , and build a barn . But the security of that sort of life bored him . He wanted to move about over the pleasant earth and meet pleasant people and play with them . Hotels fascinated him , and he owned a few and managed more . He first succumbed to the charm of the hotel in New Orleans , where hundreds of men came to play and eat and drink royally . The art of mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that art and joyously mastered it , never caring to imbibe the meticulously concocted libations . His tipple was a stiff drink of whisky before breakfast . He did not like it , but it was necessary to kill germs and to preserve his unfailingly excellent health . His ancestors had practiced this therapy for generations . Incidentally , I am sure that if mamma had taken a stiff drink before breakfast he would have been horrified . Germs were chivalrous and attacked men only . His theory of the hotel dining room was that it should be ready to supply , without notice , anything from hummingbirds under glass to moose steaks smothered in mushrooms . And his dining rooms aimed at that impossible goal . Also , gentlemen wished to play cards . It was , therefore , his duty as host to see that they played among themselves . No one who might cheat could be tolerated . He employed gamblers to teach him every means of marking the cards or playing in partnership so that he could detect crooks and protect his guests . His card games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , and the players often implored him to snatch a few hours from his managerial duties and join them . Mamma said he ran a gambling house . Papa stared at her , pale with horror . " Women . His social position was completely established . He hunted and fished with these guests ; he bought their hunting dogs and they bought his ; more often the dogs were gifts , however . But mamma had no social position at all , to her continuing amazement . And she could not imagine social position without him . He never realized that . Among the guests who came to the hotel were numerous merchants , bankers , lawyers , plantation owners and salesmen , very often accompanied by their large families . Mamma would have loved meeting these nice people ; and they would have liked her . To papa they were the necessary run-of-the-mine customers , to be treated with professional courtesy , well fed , luxuriously housed , and sent on their way . All would be certain to return in due season for reasons that did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clearly understood were much more pleasant folk . Women , he judged , made their own social life . Papa could not imagine a dignified social life with women present . At home , however , he was always pleasant . A little boy was an amusing creature ; likewise a little girl , my younger sister . He patted and petted us and brought us candy and told us tall tales and laughed heartily when we missed the joke . He never spoke crossly to either of us and never punished us . We were toys . Mamma regarded us as the next generation of the Chichesters and resented his casual treatment of her offspring . She smacked us into music lessons and decent manners and cleanliness and Sunday school . During all this time , to the best of my knowledge and belief , she was confidently expecting him to reform , and follow a behavior pattern closer to that of his father and her father . Any tomorrow might accomplish that change ; and certainly should . She stubbornly retained this faith until she died , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic that ought to he better understood ; namely , the persons who are completely incompatible can not believe that there is any such human being as the other . Certainly mamma believed , all her life , that papa would suddenly see the light . Hers With the only sane life , as Mhe saw it . His was the happy life , as he saw it . As a child of this union I loved both of them . If I had become prejudiced or biased I should consider myself incapacitated for writing this account of their lives . I felt only love and devotion  --  and some pityfor them . Mamma wanted him to quit being // a rollicking little boy and settle down with a respectable bank or merchandising or manufacturing establishment . I do n't believe it ever occurred to her that this would have been difficult , even if he had had any desire to follow her advice . And most strange of all was her own estimate of the principal obstacle : she had at him fur years with verbal prodding to study bookkeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest difficulty keeping his accounts . When I was struggling unsuccessfully with algebra I used to go to him for help and he would read the problem , close his eyes , grunt two or three times , and give me the correct answer . That , of course , was not what I needed . The correct answer was in the textbook . My problem was with the process , and that he could never explain . His mathematics came to him with the air he breathed . And mamma thought he should take a course in bookkeeping ! " Women . . " he would say , and grin . Her stream of advice never seemed to anger him . Indeed I doubt that it even annoyed him , because he once remarked to me with a wink  --  after I was married  --  that " the successful husband develops one tin ear and chooses his chair so that it is turned toward the noise . " Mamma could not imagine the existence of respectable people who did not regard church attendance as absolutely necessary . Papa would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was orthodox beyond any standard that I have encountered in recent years . Hell 's fires were very real to her . Papa would grin pleasantly and say : " Fire insurance ! " He would also say : " Church people . . . " and leave the sentence uncompleted , but I knew what he meant even when I was eight years old . He merchandised entertainment and he was always in some sort of conflict with demands for Sunday closing . His side won at least nine times out of ten , and easily . A little pressure , very seldom a bribe , I think . Anyway , his side won . The opposition was so easily beaten that it was contemptible . Mamma missed this so completely that she eventually wondered whether males had any reverence at all for God , any slightest sen- , e of religion . A Father 's Faith But I knew that papa 's religion was an essential part of his happy life . He believed in a kind God who was eager to forgive sins . He knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no wish to hurt anyone , so his sins were of omission . God could wipe those off the slate , and would . He needed no fire insurance ; he did not even believe in the fire . All was well . " Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us " was all he needed for happy assurance . He had complete faith in that God , because he forgave every trespasser . Not only forgave them , but he would buy them drinks and food and provide shelter , if he had it and they needed it . Mamma was passionately fond of flowers and always had a garden , also numerous small pots and tin cans and boxes that she hovered over with maternal solicitude , grieving over each drooping invalid and thrilled by each colorful success . It pained her that papa never noticed the flowers or listened to her remarks about them . That any human would not respond to their beauty seemed to her impossible . She hoped to educate him eventually . Actually he was a nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to was the little pots . He would glance at them and say , almost inaudibly : " Women . . . " His idea of beauty in a garden was vegetables , planted as much for contrasting color effects as for food . His gardens , no matter how small , were lovely . Often they burned up before the returns paid for the seed , but he did not mind . He had enjoyed the sight of the plants in their infancy . Flowers , he thought , belonged in pastures and on hillsides , and along the fences of fields . Cut flowers in vases struck him as an affectation and a minor form of murder that only women would commit . Because of his pagan enjoyment of untamed nature his frequent hunting and fishing trips could not fail to bring joy . Often they brought no game or fish . I am sure that , on these occasions , mamma wondered , as she observed his beaming face , if men were quite sane . He would spend hours cleaning and polishing and oiling guns . Mamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no game , regrettable labor . She never guessed that he was caressing his beloved toys precisely as she caressed her house with broom and brush . The nature of a house and its place in civilized society remained a mystery to him . The order , cleanliness and beauty were purchased at too high a price ; he accepted them , but I am sure that he would have been just as well pleased if the hunting dogs had been permitted to gnaw bones under the dining-room table . He loved a camp . Mamma 's superlative cooking was also accepted without acclaim . He liked utterly plain food just as well . Two of his favorite dishes were boiled beef with horseradish , and liver and bacon . The third was a salad that he would trust no one else to make . It was compounded of cabbage , sliced lace-thin , tomatoes , cucumbers , onions , radishes and carrots . No sauce ; just a sprinkle of salt . In these days of diets I hesitate to testify about the amount he ate . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quart . Many times I have seen him eat eight broiled quail or an entire roaa chicken or all of a large porterhouse steak . Until he was nearly fifty his midsection resembled that of a greyhound . His enormous meals stimulated him ; he was never sleepy after eating . Mamma thought he ate too much and said so . I well remember the day when I was about six years old that she cautioned him at the dinner table . He summoned me to accompany him and marked off a race course of sixty feet on the lawn . Then he informed me that I was to run my very best and he would hop on his right foot // only . He clapped his hands and we were off ! He won by about three feet . Returning , he demanded of mamma : " Now what do you say ? " She answered promptly : " You eat too much . " Among the mysteries of our home , the piano probably ranked first for papa . He had no sense of music . A brass band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the uniforms and bright instruments contributed more than the music . You probably know that on rare occasions the United States Army has to release a recruit because he can not identify the bugle rails . Papa might have been one of these . I recall a hunting trip when he was driving the four mules , after an unusually substantial before-breakfast drink , and rejoicing because the cold and cloudy dawn promised an ideal day for sport . He was so happy that he began to make strange noises . They alarmed me . I wondered whether he was dangerously intoxicated , whether he was trying to tell me something , possibly important , or whether he was ill . The sounds could be mistaken for asthma or acute indigestion . I took the reins and questioned him anxiously . He informed me that he had been singing Yankee Doodle . This was the lovable gentleman for whom mamma had played the piano , many , many times . In the matter of their musical incompatibility , he was as patient with her as she with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music lessons . But of all their conflicts , the most fundamental related to money . Mamma thought that it was obvious beyond any remote possibility of argument that papa was not qualified to act as guardian and administrator of the family purse . He should give her all the money and she would dole out his daily expense allowance . To papa this was indecent , obscene , insulting and altogether horrible . He would cheerfully have been burned at the stake rather than surrender ; and he never did . He was entirely willing to report daily on the state of the treasury . but he had to remain the treasurer or hand her his trousers in return for her skirt . Her desire was simply to put away a little by a little as her parents had done ; his theory of the use of money was to garner at least 100-per-cent profit on each risk . " To hell with the penny hoarding ! Leave that to the Chinese . " Nevertheless , he was a remarkably efficient penny hoarderwhen the objective was anew gun . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun emerged from a hunting boot or cartridge bag . Mamma would always know that he was hiding money , . and look for it , but if she ever found one of these caches I do not recall the event . She would pry out of him all the money she could get because , as she saw it , while we had never missed a meal or been dispossessed by a sheriff , there was a high probability of both any Tuesday morning . Against these imminent dangers she hoarded goods . There was an old trunk so large that none like it has been built for decades , and this was filled with pieces of cloth purchased from department stores at their Friday remnant sales . There were dishes and silver concealed in closets ; also sheets , tablecloths , pillow covers , napkins and bath towels . Without exploring completely , papa had some knowledge of these hoards that , as he expressed it , mamma had squirreled away . They served to confirm his belief That every woman would instantly spend every cent she could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond her control . Well , he controlled it for her ; and considered it nothing more than his obvious duty to do so . Not much cash for her . Necessities , yes ; but not cash . " Women . . . " Mamma had a keen sense of the duty to save money because there was , in every life , a hobgoblin called " old age . " Papa did not believe in it . I well remember the day when one of his business ventures folded up and he came home with an enormous and beautiful bunch of grapes imported from Spain . Price , one dollar . His last dollar . He was telling her something . She wept . He laughed . We did not starve . Papa was nearing threescore years and ten when I last visited his home , and he had just planted hundreds of cuttings that were to grow into beautiful trees . He had to shove me here and there so I could see these cuttings because they were not larger than a lead pencil in diameter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now , " he said , " these trees will be beautiful . " And I knew that he expected to be there and enjoy them . Four years later he was dead after an operation , the first serious illness of his carefree life . He never expected to be ill ; he regarded illness as absurd . The Christian Scientists would have loved him and he would have loved them if he had ever read one of their books . But he never read any book as far as I can recall . Mamma read books , but he regarded this as comparable to drinking whisky  --  escape from reality . He drank whisky to escape malaria . Alcoholics and readers of books he regarded as in the same category . Readers , female ; drinkers , male . They would do much better , as he did , to tramp through the woods and enjoy the beauty of the wildflowers and the wild fauna . From time to time mamma would take to her bed very ill . What was the trouble ? No answer . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . And all of us knew that there was nothing to worry about . She was on a sit-down strike . Papa would smile and register sympathy , with his tongue in his cheek , and my sister and I would have a grand time keeping house . A doctor would be called . He would shake his head sadly . He knew that momma needed a psychiatrist . But that fringe of science was not even a fringe then . My sister and I cooked and washed dishes and had a wonderful time until mamma got well . But when mamma became i11 , of what the doctor described most seriously as an incurable disease , papa hovered over her solicitously . He stood by , day and night , for many months . When she died he saw that she was buried in the garments which she had selected . And he survived her by less than a year . Peace to their ashes ! They never had peace here , but they loved each other ; and sometimes , I think , they had glorious happiness about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
