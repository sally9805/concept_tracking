SURFACING a board , frequently a tedious task by hand , can usually be done faster and better by any of several different power tools . While a jointer is primarily designed for working the edges of boards and for truing up square stock , as for table legs , it will surface narrow lumber quickly and can even be used to plane stock wider than the machine . The usual small 4 " or 6 " shop jointer has three keen blades set into a slotted cylinder belted to turn about 4000 r.p.m . An " infeed " table that can be adjusted for depth of cut supports the board as it is fed against the cutter head ; an " outfeed " table , set level with the blades at the top of their travel , carries the surfaced end of the board . These parts can be seen in the photo above and in Figs. 1 and 2 . Since such jointers can trim 5 16 " or more from the thickness of a board , it is easy to smooth rough stock with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lower the table by turning the ball crank beneath it , and check the depth of cut on the scale . Lumber can be safely led by hand if it is 1 1/2 " thick or more . Set the fence far enough to the right to allow the full width of the board to pass over the cutter head . Push the wood forward with the right hand while the fingers of the left hold it firmly clown on the infeed table . Many workmen consider it poor practice to allow the forward , or left ,  | hand to follow the board over the blades . Instead , let the hand slide back until the front portion of the board bears on the outfeed table . Then carry the left hand around the side of the jointer and place it on the end . While modern " safety " cutting heads are somewhat less dangerous than the older square type , it is only common sense to keep the guard in place whenever possible . A pair of " mittens , " or push blocks , is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them , mortise comfortable handles into bases big enough to shield the hands , as shown in Fig. 3 . The push cleat is attached only to the follower mitten . Twisted wood must be jointed with pressure on the high corners to keep the piece from rolling with the twist . It is advisable to make a short pass or two to reduce the high corners , or to take a cut from the convex center of a board so the entire board can be passed over the cutters without rolling out of level . Since the cutter action tends to lift the work , pressure applied at one edge causes that side to cut faster than the other , giving the board a wedge section ( Fig. 4 ) . A wide board can be smoothed fairly well by passing half the width over the machine , turning it end for end , and planing the other half . Distribute the pressure evenly , or a deep offset , as shown in Fig. 5 , will remain where the two cuts overlap . A fine cut reduces such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it entirely . The - cutter blades stay sharp longer if you plane only clean stock without dirt , imbedded nails , or screws . Clean out the shaving chute occasionally , for if it clogs , the cutter head will throw shavings out on the table . Shavings driven into the surface will cause bruising and pockmarking even on hardwood ( Fig. 6 ) . Excellent surfacing jobs can be done with  | a rotary planer used in a drill press , as illustrated in Fig. 7 . A typical tool of this kind has three small blades , ground sharp on the outer and lower edges , clamped in an aluminum body . Insert the planer in the drill chuck or attach it to a Morse taper spindle adapter . With the quill at the top , adjust the height of the table so that the board resting on it is about 4 ' below the blades . Across the back of the table clamp a strip of wood for a fence , placing it so that the planer will overhang the edge of the work slightly . Lower the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to remove the entire surface . Pass the board evenly from left to right under the planer while forcing it against the fence . Lifting an end or edge causes gouging . For the second pass move the fence back and repeat the operation . When the center of the board is reached , turn it end for end and repeat . After a little practice the fence can be dispensed with . Burning may result if the blades are dull or the feed is too slow . Striations or circular scratches bulging toward either side show that that edge of the table is slightly higher than the other . To remedy this , remove the table pin , loosen the lock nut a trifle , and strike the high edge with the hand . Tighten the nut and try a new cut or test the table for levelness by using a wire with a double bend , as shown in Fig. 8 . As the chuck is turned , the tip of the wire rubs the high spots . The table of an old drill press may be worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure is to clamp on a flat board as an auxiliary table , shimming it up with paper or cardboard at the low parts . Sanding on a drill press is an operation  | similar to planing . Rest a planed board on the table and lower the sander to touch it . The pressure should be light enough to permit the piece to be drawn from under the sander while it is stationary . Set the speed fairly high and pass the board smoothly beneath the sander ( Fig. 9 ) . Rough boards can also be sanded , but the paper grit is conserved by planing the board first . Burning may be caused by too high a speed , clogged paper , slow feed , or a combination of these faults . A fast and thorough job of sanding can be done with a belt sander . Such a machine has a sandpaper belt passing over two pulleys that are adjustable for tension and alignment . Small machines have a flat backing plate below the upper side of the belt , while some have a table below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest the board lightly on the moving belt and stroke it evenly from end to end . Avoid rocking it over the ends , since this hollows the board . If the lumber is wider than the belt , move it sidewise progressively to give even sanding over the entire face . Use the fence , or dam , whenever work permits . Sanding beneath is accomplished by resting the board on the adjustable lower table and stroking it with a mitten pressed on the back of the belt ( Fig. 10 ) . Lower the mitten gradually and lift it easily at the end of the board or stroke . Move the board for another stroke . If a finishing cut with a fine-grit belt is taken , little hand work is needed to prepare for a high-grade paint or varnish job . Pieces of wood short enough to hold against a disk sander with little or no projection beyond the edge are readily surfaced by grasping the piece ( Fig. 11 ) and moving it around over the disk . Remember that the edge of the disk travels faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to hold the work firmly , especially if you do n't keep it down on the table . The reason for this is that if it should grab while bearing against the rising half of the disk , it may be pulled from your grasp . In general keep work on the table , in contact with just the downward-moving part of the disk . A typical portable belt sander , illustrated in Fig. 12 , is used much like a hand plane . It is raised at the end of the stroke , but unlike the plane , it must not be allowed to pause at any point in its progress from one end of the board to the other , since the belt cuts continually whether the body moves or not .  |
