Take A Letter , Darling ( Paramount ) is dedicated to the proposition that anything can happen in an advertising agency . On this premise , it is not unreasonable that in the firm of Atwater ( Robert Benchley ) &; MacGregor ( Rosalind Russell ) the senior partner should devote his time to pitching quoits and avoiding issues while his attractive junior does all the work . <P> That is the kind of thing Rosalind Russell has been do.ng in a series of career-woman pictures , most of which have made rather unfunny use of her firm talent for comedy . This time she has the welcome assistance of a first-rate Claude Binyon script , the expert direction of J. Mitchell Leisen , and a chorus of sweet supporting performers . Result : a very funny full-dress comedy . <P> The darling who takes Adwoman Russell 's letters is dog-jawed , indestructible Fred MacMurray , an unsuccessful painter with a fallen stomach . His principal duties are to charm the suspicious wives of his boss 's million-dollar accounts and to mind his manners around the brunette executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with him and raises his salary . All ends well after the secretary lands a big tobacco account with a campaign showing that most great painters smoked while they worked-it quiets the nerves , quickens the eye , etc . <P> For Paramount , bedeviled by the inexorable disappearance of young leading Hollywood males into the U.S. armed forces , the happiest discovery of Take A Letter is undoubtedly bright , manly MacDonald Carey , whose first cinemappearance ( as the tobacco baron ) is a bang-up job . Fresh from the corn country ( University of Iowa , ' 35 ) , young Carey moved into his first Broadway role as Gertrude Lawrence 's leading man in Lady in the Dark . Paramount , which had previously tested and rejected him , took him when it bought the play . Now it can do nothing but weep over its new find . His draft rating is 1-A . <P> This Gun For Hire ( Paramount ) might have been designed for the carnage trade . A razor-edged melodrama , it possesses some of the most calculated killing to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early ' 30s . <P> The practitioner of the gentle art of elimination is a handsome , green-eyed youngster named Alan Ladd , billed as The Raven . A hired killer , he likes his work , and is not above saying so . Having polished off a blackmailer and his moll before breakfast he returns the stolen poison-gas formula to the chemical-company executive ( Laird Cregar ) who paid him to get it that way , and submits to one question : " How do you feel when you are doing a job like this ? " Says The Raven , without batting an eye : " I feel fine . " Before The Raven finally meets his maker and cashes in his sins at the Hays office , he has punctured a number of other citizens , both deserving and undeserving , met straight-haired Veronica Lake ( a torch-singing magician employed by a U.S. <P> Senate investigating committee ) , and foiled a plot to sell poison gas to the Japs - altogether a good day 's work for Killer Ladd , and a better than middling melodrama . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find of the wartime season . Like his studio mate , he is also 1-A in the draft .
