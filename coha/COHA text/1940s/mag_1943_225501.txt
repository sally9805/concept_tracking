At Long Island 's Belmont Park , Count Fleet romped off with the Belmont Stakes for a clean sweep of America 's five spring specials for three-year-olds . Just as in the Wood Memorial , Derby , Preakness and Withers , there was no one to press the colt that started his racing career last summer as the fastest two-year-old of all time . <P> The Count has already won 16 races , earned $250,300 , made a runaway farce of top 1943 three-year-old events . The final test of ability will come when he is entered in races against older horses like Whirlaway , Alsab , Market Wise and Don Bingo , the four-year-old Argentine colt that ruined Bob Hope 's radio scripts when he won the Suburban Handicap for Bing Crosby earlier in the week . <P> On Suburban Day at Belmont , New York racing fans wagered $2,699,153 , a world 's record . On Belmont Day , they bet only $1,731,155 . One reason : Count Fleet went to the post at odds of about 1-to-200 . To pay off the legal pari-mutuel minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to shell out $15,912.
