Another warning finger was pointed at the antiquated machinery of Congress . After a four-year study , the Committee on Congress of the American Political Science Association told Congressmen they now had two alternatives : they could go on with the present cumbersome , outdated practices , steadily surrendering leadership to the Executive , or they could reorganize and operate more effectively . <P> The A.P.S.A. report , published by the American Council on Public Affairs , in general paralleled the National Planning Association proposals ( TIME , Jan. 29 ) , but seemed even more detailed and realistic . N.P.A. had recommended raising Congressmen 's salaries from $10,000 a year to $25,000 ; A.P.S.A. called this a " somewhat mythical figure , " suggested $15,000 . Gist of the A.P.S.A. plan : <P> Delegate to other agencies such odd jobs as running the District of Columbia , settling private claims and pensions . <P> Equip Congressional committees with experts , eliminate inactive committees , consolidate overlapping ones , create like sets of committees in both Houses . <P> Promote more effective liaison with the Executive by establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments . <P> Curb lobbying by registering pressure groups . <P> Set an automatic tenure of possibly six years for chairmen of standing committees , or ( dropping the seniority system ) have them chosen by the Committee on Committees of the majority party .
