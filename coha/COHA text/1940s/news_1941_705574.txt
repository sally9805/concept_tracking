txt Continues to Convalesce Special Cable b T.ss NEW YORE Tr , vca LONDON , May ** Rudolf Hess continued convalescing from the broken ankle suffered in jumping from a German war plane over Scotland , further details of his flight and mission were released by censorship , putting into reverse the early movement to make a hero of him . There were reports that the Nazi fugitive might soon be brought to London for a talk with Prime Minister Winston Churchill . He still remains under treatment , however , at a place of detention whose location it is not permitted to reveal . His questioning continues . Herr Hess was described as talking freely , but of what was not made known . The censorship now permits it to be stated that he headed in a Messerschmitt 110 from Augsburg , Germany , for the estate of the Duke of Hamilton at Dungavel , not far from Glasgow , and ' landed within three miles of his goal . It is also permitted to reveal that he was first taken to Paisley and then to Maryhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I have come to save humanity . I am Rudolf Hess . " As evidence of the beneficent nature of his mission , he is reported to have waved a picture of the baby he left at home . It was learned today that Glasgow police first checked Herr Hess 's identity by a scar he received on the head during the Munich beer hall Putsch of 1923 .. This was fully described in newspaper clippings the police obtained from The Glasgow Herald . He was then removed to a place it is not permitted to reveal to the outside world , although it is no secret in London and probably no secret in Berlin either Meanwhile there had sprung up among many Britons and generally in certain sections of the British press a strong movement to heroize // LONDON DECLARES HESS SOUGHT PEACE // him . He was painted as a strong man who loved Adolf Hitler , could not stand to see the way things were going and could not stomach a rapprochement with Russia and so flew out . The fact that since before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-hand man and close confidant and patronage dispenser was totally overlooked . ' This approach quickly brought strong public reaction . In effect the British public said that if he was going to cave anything , why did he not start saving things sooner . Meanwhile he was just another Nazi . Lord Beaverbrook 's Daily Express tonight tried to sound a rational view , combining the less radical position of both camps . " The surrender of Hess is undoubtedly a very serious embarrassment to Hitler . It may prove to be more than that . It may prove the turning point in the upsurge of power the Nazi party has had in Germany . Events will show . " Quotes a Refugee Paper . The Daily Express then quoted from a German refugee paper published in London that " Hess is as bad as the worst of them . He had ? beside Ernst Roehm  --  been Hitler 's first and closest associate and joint founder of the Storm Troopers . His flight is ground for grim satisfaction , not a soft pardon . " It became more apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero of Herr Hess , this is likely to be the final judgment . Many observers on the Left conclude that Herr Hess is not yet turning out to be the great tale and information bearer he was first presumed to be . His definition of " humanity " has not yet been stated . On this background the war has turned back to its first days when the combat was carried on mostly by radio , at least as far as the Germans were concerned . Last night German raiders over Britain were few and far between , and tonight there have been virtually none . Instead of bombs , there is the German radio , and the best suggestion of the meaning of this phenomenon is the fact that most news about Herr Hess printed in sober , reflective papers here , such as The Times , is either based on German radio reports or items attributed to British United Press correspondents in Berlin and news from Tokyo . In these it is being stated that Herr Hess had no knowledge of war plans and that he had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Germany within two days or that he is Herr Hitler 's astrologer . Combating these things , the British Broadcasting Corporation is doing everything it can to keep Germany nervous about what Herr Hess might be doing- and saying . Ten times daily the B. B. C. goes on the air with European news broadcasts in German , telling the Germans that " we are giving every fact we know . " These broadcasts emphasize that Herr Hess is " talking freely , telling everything he knows . " " We always knew your gang was a pretty rotten crew , corrupt and without solidarity , " said one such broadcast . " What has happened has confirmed the view we had all along . " We are not ' really interested In your party- squabbles . We are very glad to have your No. 3 in our hands , but we are not fooled into relaxing our bombing effort generally . " The German war machine has got to . be smashed . What - Hess 's coming here does for us is . to- encourage us by letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We treat Hess merely , as a Nazi who saw the handwriting on the wall and got out while the going was good . " While there were German efforts to continue the notion that Herr Hess is mentally maimed , the fact remained that he made an excellent flight . His map was said today to have had a heavy blue line charting his course from Augsburg to Scotland , terminating in a big circle around Dungavel , which is the Duke of Hamilton 's seat . Douglas Douglas-Hamilton , Fourteenth Duke of Hamilton - and Eleventh Duke of Brandon , is 38 years old . He succeeded to these titles last year , becoming the premier peer of Scotland . He is an amateur pugilist and flier and is currently serving as an honorary air commodore of the Royal Air Force . He is the youngest man in the service holding that title . One of the remarkable things about the British handling of the news of Herr Hess is the fact that the Duke of Hamilton 's name has been barred by the censors , who only unloosened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had flown to make contact with the Duke in an effort to , arrange a peace between Germany and England . Having gone this far , the British then went further and revealed that several months ago Herr Hess sought to communicate by letter with the Duke and his letter was immediately placed in the hands of security officers by the Duke , while no reply was sent .
