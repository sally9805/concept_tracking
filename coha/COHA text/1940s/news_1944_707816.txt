txt Advisory Master Dougal Herr of the New Jersey Chancery Court ruled today that the Nevada divorce obtained by Doris Duke Cromwell from James H. R. Cromwell , former United States Minister to Canada , was invalid in this State on all the grounds presented by Mr. Cromwell , who contended that the tobacco heiress was not a legal resident of Nevada when the divorce decree was granted in Reno last December . The action of Mr. Herr makes Mrs. Cromwell the legal wife of Mr. Cromwell in New Jersey , according to the latter 's counsel . Mrs. Cromwell did not contest the invalidation proceedings . If she does not file an appeal and if she does appeal and loses , the way will be clear for the trial of Mr. Cramwell 's suit for a limited New Jersey divorce on a charge of desertion . When the limited divorce suit ' was filed hi Trenton last September , Mr. Cromwell said such a decree would prevent either from remarrying , though he would have courtesy rights to her estate if she predeceased him . Mrs. Cromwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . In a verbal opinion , Advisory Master Herr said : " I declare the decree of Mrs. Cromwell null , void and without effect in the State of New Jersey on all the grounds which have been presented to me . I have no doubt about it . " Nothing further need be said on the question of fraud on domicile . There was clear and cogent testimony and other proof that Mrs. Cromwell 's domicile has not been changed from and still is New Jersey . " Fraud Held Conspicuous The Advisory Master said the " element of fraud was conspicuous , " and it was his understanding that under New Jersey and Federal law a married woman was not competent legally to select a domicile outside the State if her husband preferred to remain within that State . After stressing that Mrs. Cromwell had no legal right to establish a separate residence out of the State without her husband 's consent , Mr. Herr declared that Nevada had forfeited its right for respect under the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution in sealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Jersey court . " This court , " he added , " has not only a right to inspect the record , but a duty which is being interfered with by the Nevada court . " Asked by his counsel whether he agreed to permit Mrs. Cromwell to establish a separate residence , Mr. Cromwell replied : " That is a difficult question . I might say that I assented in the same sense that Denmark assented to the invasion by Germany . " Then he declared that his wife had established a separate home without his consent . He testified further that although his wife had stated in her Reno divorce petition that she was a resident of Hawaii as of June , 1940 , she was a New Jersey resident after that month . In September of that year , he asserted , she attended , as a New Jersey resident , a meeting of the Board of Control of the State Department of Institutions and Agencies , of which she was a member . Furthermore , he contended , she did not resign from the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the petitioner 's attorney brought out that Mrs. Cromwell , in her Nevada suite had charged him with persistent and systematic mental and physical cruelty , he exclaimed : " That 's one of the most outrageous lies that has ever been . uttered . " Advisory Master Herr announced that he would hand down a written decision later . This , a recommendation , will go to the Chancellor , who seldom rejects the findings of advisory masters . In his testimony yesterday , Mr. Cromwell attributed the loss of his wife 's affections to her alleged infatuation with another man and to the influence of her . lawyer , whom he described as " a good Republican reactionary , " and Who , he said , he was sure had " helped to , poison Mrs. Cromwelr s mind against me . " He also testified that Mrs. CromI well had not sympathized with his political views as a " good New Dealer " and today he charged that the Duke interests had worked against him when he was a candidate for the United States Senate from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey thought that Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City and the Duke power gang were behind me , " he added . " That was bad enough , but actually both were trying to destroy me . Far from being the fair-haired boy of Mayor Hague , I never saw him again until the end of the campaign . " Meyer E. Ruback , who , with Senator John E. Toolan , is representing Mr. Cromwell , said tonight the annulment of the Nevada divorce by Mr. Herr means that the New Jersey courts huld that the Nevada court " never had acquired jurisdiction over Mrs. Cromwell or the dispute " for two reasons : Firstly , that Mrs. Cromwell had no bona fide residence in Nevada , and she was and still is a resident of New Jersey . Secondly , that the State of Nevada lost its right to claim faith and credence of its judgment because it had screened the evidence on which it rested its judgment in preventing the examination of the evidence by Mr. Cromwell and his attorneys . Mr. Cromwell , in a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Jersey , at open hearings , examined into my matrimonial affairs , found me free of all blame , and adjudged the Nevada divorce to be a ' phony . ' " Mrs. Cromwell could not be reached in New York for comment . At the office of her attorney it was said there would be none .
