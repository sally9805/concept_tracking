txt To the tension hanging over the strike-bound Southern coal fields was added tonight a report that most Southern soft-coal operators would deny credit at company stores to idle ( miners . Harry G. Kennedy , labor commissioner of the Kanawha Coal Operators Association , said the mine owners had been advised by their attorneys that the extension of credit to strikers might be ? conslrued as a violation of the SmithConnally Act and of the order issued in Washington before the strike by Federal Judge T. Alan Goldsborough . Major operators in Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia have indicated that they would continue the usual practice of giving store credit to strikers unless the Government specifically objected . The Navy coal mines administration has taken a " hands off " position . Officials point out that the executive order under which the mines were seized last spring left the company stores under the control of the operators . Informally they have made it clear that they have no wish to influence the owners to starve the miners into submission . The divergent policies on ? store sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators to all problems of union - management relations . The Southern operators have opposed John L. Lewis and the United Mine Workers more consistently and more bitterly than their Northern counterparts . As a result the danger of strike violence is always greater in the Southern field than it is in the North . William Blizzard , president of District 17 of the United Mine Workers , described the decision to withhold credit from strikers as " rotten , " but added : " They are always rotten down here . " He said the miners would " get by " even if the company stores were shut down entirely . " Most of the men have been putting aside some savings , " Mr. Blizzard said . " They can take care of themselves for six weeks if they have to . After all , it is easier to get along when you are not used to much , and miners never have had very much . " Miners in the ? coal towns near Charleston expressed the hope that the union would help them get funds if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would have to get along 9n their own . He said most miners helped one another out in strike periods and thus were able to spread their slender resources over the whole community . More Pay Checks This Week No showdown in the company store issue is likely to come until next month . All the miners in the Northern and Southern areas still have a full two-week pay check due them on Nov.30 for work done in the first half of this month . Mr. Kennedy said the operators were allowing miners to draw against these checks in their current purchases at-mine stores . In the opinion of company lawyers such credit did not raise a question of possible law violation , the association executive declared . He added that most of the miners would have some wages due them on Dec. 15 , for work done between Nov. 16 and Nov. 20 , when the strike became effective . In the villages that cluster around the sooty black mine tipples east of Charleston , miners ' wives were doing their Thanksgiving shopping today , but turkey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not sold a single turkey this week . Most of the miners will kill chikens from their own tiny broods . Some more fortunate ones were slaughtering hogs . One of these was Charles Preston , who works at the Cedar Grove collieries . With the help of a neighbor , he killed three pigs and hung them out behind his little frame house . Tomorrow , he will cut off some choice bits for his family 's Thanksgiving dinner . The rest he will salt away in his cellar to provide food for most of the winter . In most of the other homes in Cedar Grove and Tompkins and Ward and Hughesville and a dozen other tiny towns along United States Route 60 , the food outlook was leaner . Abner Taylor , who runs the , combination general store and post office at Hughesville , said sales had dropped to almost nothing since the strike began . " People are buying only what they need and not much of that , " Mr. Taylor mourned . " They have turned from steak to bologna and turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , I do n't know what the people will do . " Mr. Taylor said he planned to extend as much credit as he could at his independent store . But he added that his own creditors would jump on him if he got too far extended and he did not have much credit to start with . Much more pretentious was the company store of the Kelley Creek Coal Company at Ward . Its three shopping floors were jam-packed with food , clothing and furniture . Electronic blankets , gleaming new refrigerators , lavish bedroom suites with gilt angels ' wings on the mirror trimmings and sumptuous doll houses were included in its stock . But in the door was a sign that read : " This store closes daily at noon until further notice . " Inside James B. Kennedy , the manager , said sales were off sharply and that half of the store 's forty employes had been laid off . Perfume , jewelry and other costly items were not moving at all , Mr. Kennedy said . Meat , bread and other foodstuffs make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coal and Coke Company store at Cedar Grove was dark and deserted in. mid-afternoon . On its door was a hand-written sign which said : " To all traveling salesmen  --  we do n't need a thing . " The one store in the area that continued to do a flourishing trade was that of the State Liquor Control Commission at Cedar Grove . The manager said it normally took in about $30,000 a month in whisky , gin , brandy and wine sales . There has been no falling off since the present walkout , and the manager said he did not expect any for at least two weeks . High Earnings in One Area The mines in this area have been operating on a full six-day basis since the last strike ended , May 29 . Unlike workers in northern West Virginia , where a shortage of railroad coal cars kept the mines inactive three or four days a week , the union members here have been averaging between $75 and $90 a week for the last five months . From the outside their homes are squalid . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and porches are tumbling in . Inside , however , most homes are expensively furnished . It is easy to understand why the mine areas are regarded as a salesmen 's paradise in periods when pay checks are coming in regularly . The miners here are as resolute to see the present strike to a successful conclusion as their fellowunionists in the northern areas . They will follow Mr. Lewis " until the end of time , " as one of them put it today . All hope the strike will end before Christmas , but they show no sign of drawing back if it extends until Christmas of next year .
