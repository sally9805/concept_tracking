Uncle Dave Macon , age 70 , has gold uppers , alfalfa on his chin , sometimes sports pink gates-ajar collars . He has a ready rube wit . an endless repertory of high jinks , and plays three five-stringed banjos at once . Uncle Dave sets the tone &; tune of Grand Ol ' Opry , a radio program many plain folk in the South vastly prefer to Charlie McCarthy or Jack Benny . <P> Grand Ol ' Opry is a four-hour , mountain-music hoe-down broadcast every Saturday night by WSM , Nashville , Tenn. , and carried in part over a network of 25 southern NBC Stations . It has been on the air 14 years , now has eight sponsors ( main account : Prince Albert Tobacco ; others : lamps , cough drops , chicory , even snuff ) . A half - hour of it is now recorded for Prince Albert , put on the air in Los Angeles , Denver , Kansas City , Minneapolis . <P> Supporting Uncle Dave in the Grand Ol ' Opry Company are a half-dozen ensembles with sour-mash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jumpers , Roy Acuff and his Smoky Mountain Boys . Grand Ol ' Opry is no ordinary hillbilly show . It is opportunity night for all the balladeers , jug players , mouth-organists , fiddlers , washboard knucklers , accordionists , comb-hummers , etc . It is a weekly fiesta , Southern style , for hill folk from the Great Smokies , croppers , tourists . <P> In its time , Grand Ol ' Opry has coaxed out of the hills a great album of musty , hand-me-down folk songs . Some are fiddly old dances , like Tennessee Waggoner , Rabbit in the Pea Patch , Cross-Eyed Butcher , Give the Fiddler a Dram , Chittlin ' Cookin ' Time in Cheatham County . Others , plaintive and plunky like Maple on the Hill , Brown 's Ferry Blues , Nobody 's Darlin ' but Mine , have gone on to wide juke-box favor . One recent find was a fine old Fundamentalist allegory called The Great Speckled Bird , probably inspired by Jeremiah 12:9 . <P> Last Saturday the Grand Ol ' Opry turnout was swelled by a delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on hand to hear a straight-limbed , sixth-generation mountain girl sing a song her grandpappy taught her . The girl was 23-year-old Edith Haas Padgett , famed far &; wide in the hills for once having bagged a charging 400-lb. wild boar with a single rifle shot . <P> Edith stood up with Roy Acuff , Uncle Dave , the Fruit Jar Drinkers , etc. and in a mountain-dewy voice sang The Broken Heart : <P> Farewell ' t is with a breaking heart <P> That I now turn to see you go . <P> But we are better far apart . <P> God bless you in your bitter woe . <P> The hand Edith got for this Smoky plaint was roughly comparable , in Grand O1 ' Opry circles , to the way Lily Pons was welcomed to the Metropolitan . Right off , Edith was invited to join the Opry company . And Uncle Dave , Roy Acuff and the rest were pretty sure that The Broken Heart , properly whanged up , would be a juke-box hit in no time .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
