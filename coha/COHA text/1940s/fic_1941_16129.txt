In Europe this year millions will die from lack of food , clothing and shelter . Many more will die from influenza , typhus , and cholera . The large quantities of butter and meats sent into the industrial sectors of Germany recently are only supplies stolen from the peoples of the conquered nations . When these are exhausted we shall face untold suffering . The fruit crop has been destroyed and no ersatz products have yet been discovered to replace successfully the basic foods of life .

If we did not believe this to be true , we would not continue our fight . 96 . FULL SHOT &nbsp; OTTOAnd so I say to you , guard yourselves well , our fight is not in vain - our day will come . Despair and disillusionment drove the people to Hitler ; despair and disillusionment will drive them away from him .  --  Now we 'll have the reports from the various committees .

The treasury now has 42 marks , so before the meeting is over I 'd like to talk to each member privately . During this one of the members has been snoring . &nbsp; OTTOWill the member who is snoring please stop ? &nbsp; HERMAN ( as they wake him ) I 'm sorry , friends , but I was awake all night distributing leaflets . &nbsp; ALEXGo in the back and lie down . 97-98 .

All the hands go up except that of Professor Baumer 's . &nbsp; OTTOProfessor , you object ? 102 . CLOSE SHOT PROFESSOR &nbsp; PROFESSORI do n't object . I merely think it would be wiser if we talked to Hoffman first before we took him back . 103 . ANOTHER ANGLE &nbsp; ALEXYou do n't distrust him , do you ? &nbsp; PROFESSORNo , I do n't distrust the Hoffman who worked in the Underground before he was caught . But I 'm not sure about the Hoffman who has been tortured in a concentration camp for two years . Any man who has had that experience must be looked upon with doubt . There are ad libs of agreement and refutation . &nbsp; ALEXI 'd stake my life on Hoffman . &nbsp; PROFESSORThat 's what we may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in Hamburg . If we ca n't trust Hoffman whom can we trust ? &nbsp; ALEXIf he wanted to betray us , he would have done so long ago . &nbsp; OTTO ( raps for order again ) Eric , what do you think ? &nbsp; ERICThe only risk is in his being followed . But he 's too old a hand to let that happen . Then too , Hoffman endured a living hell for the sake of the same things in which we believe . It seems  --  60  --  to me we owe him something besides distrust . There are further ad libs of agreement and denial . &nbsp; OTTOQuiet , please.  - -  Then it seems agreed that the members wish to take Hoffman back . But it seems advisable that we shall talk to him first before bringing him here . So I suggest that Herr Rolf contact Hoffman immediately after the meeting is over and the Central Committee meet tonight in Maxel 's Cafe . - Now we will go on with the other reports .  --  DISSOLVE TO : pp. 22-42 &nbsp; pp. 61-81 104 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance of the cafe is a blind man ( actually a member of the Underground ) .

Sylvia , seeing the sudden rigidity of his back , looks into the room and starts . The CAMERA SWINGS and from their point of view we see a FULL SHOT of the living room in a state of complete disorder . Chairs are topsy-turvy , and the stuffing has been ripped out of them . The whole effect looks as if the room had been ransacked to the point of demolishment . Incidentally , the lights are on at full blast . 215 .

This will put a finish to the Underground . Standing at Lustig 's desk is the Herr Director of the Chemical Institute . He is nervous and completely flabbergasted as he tries to explain even to Lustig his predicament . &nbsp; DIRECTORI knew nothing about it - absolutely nothing .

I ca n't believe it . Ella , what have you got against father ? &nbsp; ELLA ( distraught ) I do n't know , Herr Kurt . You do n't realize what they do to you nowadays . They make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what 's wrong . They mix you up so . &nbsp; KURTBut what did my father ever do to make you think he 's a traitor ?  --  115  --  &nbsp; ELLA ( confused ) The night you came home - Herr Mueller - do n't you remember ? - Your father took his side against you . &nbsp; KURTBut that was nothing . &nbsp; ELLAWell , I - Oh , please , Herr Kurt .

At this moment Heller 's Aide rushes in excitedly . &nbsp; AIDE ( to Kurt ) Good work , Herr Francken . Colonel Heller will see you in a few minutes . Wait , please .

ANOTHER ANGLE KURT AND LUSTIG Kurt looks after her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered . A strange , cruel smile comes on his lips . &nbsp; KURTShe 's been with us for fifteen years . She was like a mother to us . Lustig is puzzled by these words . &nbsp; LUSTIGStranger things than that have happened in our country , Herr Francken . For instance , what you 've just done . Colonel Heller will want to congratulate you - a man who out of loyalty to the party turned in his own brother to his death . You deserve a great deal of praise . In fact , I too would like to congratulate you  --   --  116  --  &nbsp; KURTPlease - do n't say that - Lustig watches Kurt , and detecting a note of regret , ventures further . &nbsp; LUSTIGYou were responsible for informing against your brother , were n't you , Herr Francken ? &nbsp; KURTYes , but all I meant to do was stop the illegal radio . I had no idea that Eric - &nbsp; LUSTIG ( taken aback ) You mean you did n't know who it was ? You did n't know Eric was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

You 've asked me for the truth - I 'll tell you . I knew nothing about Eric 's work in the Underground movement , neither I nor my wife - absolutely nothing . But if he did work to free our country from men as vile as you and your kind - then I 'm glad of it ! And I thank God that if I have n't the courage and the strength to fight you myself , at least I have a son . . .

You do n't care about avenging your own dignity as a man . You do n't care about those things after what you 've learned tonight ? &nbsp; KURTOf course , of course , but what can I do ? &nbsp; LUSTIGHelp us - help us to bring the truth to the people . &nbsp; KURTHelp you ? &nbsp; LUSTIGEric and I have worked in the Underground since Hitler came to power , doing whatever we could to enlighten the people , but now that he 's gone we 'll need someone to replace him .

I do n't understand . &nbsp; LUSTIGMake Heller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Eric when you phoned here tonight . &nbsp; KURTWhat ? &nbsp; LUSTIGThink of what you could do for us then . You 'd be above suspicion if you made them believe you 're with them . &nbsp; KURTBut how will that help Eric ? &nbsp; LUSTIGThere 's nothing we can do to help Eric . He 'll die on the guillotine .  --  120  --  Kurt flinches , but Lustig is relentless . &nbsp; LUSTIGI know - it 's hard to face , but they 'll kill him anyway , and the only one who can give a meaning and a purpose to his death is yourself . For if you will pretend that you knew it was Eric , then you 'll be able to carry on his work . &nbsp; KURT ( his voice almost breaks ) You 're asking me to let Eric die thinking I meant to betray him ? &nbsp; LUSTIGYes . You 've got to . &nbsp; KURTBut I ca n't . He 's got to know the truth . I ca n't do it . &nbsp; LUSTIGI 'm only asking you to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances .
