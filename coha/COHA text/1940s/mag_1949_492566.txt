I N a scarred and mine-ravaged valley in Carbon County , in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania , there are some people who whisper that a certain widow there is a witch . They are , of course , foolishly superstitious folk who have bolstered their innate readiness to believe in witches with several vague and ambiguous omens . But there is one incontrovertible fact , and that is that one morning five years ago she prophesied that on that day her husband was going to die . On that morning she followed him with hEr warn-ing outside their unpainted , two-room shack in the tiny coal-mining settlement , and at least ? lie neighbor heard her plead , " Do n't go to work today . I tell you I had a dream . I saw you lying crushed down there . " He shook her off , but later , waiting at the mine mouth for the cage to lower him into the earth , he half jokingly told several other men of his shift what she had said . And on that day he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " kettle bottom , " which is a geological fault comparable to a knot in a plank , suddenly became loosened from the roof of the mine and fell upon him . When men came with solemn faces and dragging feet to tell her , she met them at her door . Before they could open their mouths , she said , " I know . He is dead . " Thus began the legend that she was a witch . After that , those who were inclined that way saw further significance in the facts that she kept much to herself and seemed to avoid her neighbors , that she had darkly flashing eyes with a glance more piercing than a hawk 's , that she at times was heard to mumble to herself , and that she grew strange herbs in her garden . Those were silly reasons for believing a woman a witch , even among coal-mining folk , many of whom have been raised on the more eerie legends of Wales , Ireland and the Slavic lands , and of the back hills of Kentucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most preposterous thing is that they should believe her a witch because she foretold her husband 's death and knew , the instant she saw those men , what they were going to say . Coal-mining people should know better , for there is hardly a woman in that valley who has not had a similar dream , nor a coal miner 's wife in the whole country who has not had the same kind of premonition . And too often such prethonitions have come true . vive thirty years of working in the coal mines , and little better than a 4-to-1 chance to escape being I totally or partially disabled for life . The odds that he I will be injured seriously enough during those three decades to lose , on the average , forty working days , are more than 30 to 1 . Nearly 55,000 men have died in coal-mine accidents in the past thirty years , nearly 125,000 were crippled , and there were more than 2,000,000 injuries . Must there be so horrible a price in men killed and mangled for the coal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuel for every ton of steel made , drives nine out of ten locomotives , and is the source of more than half the electric power 1 we use ? The answer to that is an emphatic no . The toll . could be cut to a fraction . C. Fremont Davis , head of the safety division of the United Mine Workers of America , goes so far as to declare that it could be reduced 98 per cent . Experts of the United States Bureau of Mines are more cagey , but their private estimates run from 50 to more than 90 per cent . Whose fault then is this bloody situation , and how can it be alleviated ? The answers to those questions are more complicated , and some parts of them may be quite unpalatable , particularly to convinced State-righters . The fault seems to be a compound of the greed and callousness of some coal-mina operators , patronage politics and the hair-raising carelessness of coal miners who gamble  --  and lose  --  their lives needlessly . The record is grim with examples of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . A classic example  --  although hardly typical of present-day operations  --  is the story of what happened in Helve No. 1 Mine , at Fourmile , in Kentucky , where twenty-five men were killed on the morning after Christmas , 1945 . The story marches to its violent denouement with the inevitableness of a Greek tragedy . The explosion which killed those men was not unheralded . The stage had long been set for just such a catastrophe . Inspectors of the United States Bureau of Mines knew that it almost certainly had to come sooner or later . They gave repeated warnings , but those warnings were disregarded , and under the law they could do nothing more about it . Fourmile is a grimy , dilapidated hamlet set in a small valley , or " holler , " as it is known locally , in Bell County , in the southeastern part of Kentucky . It gets its name from the fact that it is four miles north of Pineville , the nearest town of any consequence . It consists of about forty boxlike company houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight from Tobacco Road . Some are merely two-room wooden shacks , so cheaply clapped together and so old and unrepaired that the wind whistles through gaps between planks . They have , of course , no baths or inside toilets . Some of the outside privies are open at the bottom , breeding disease , as do the garbage and refuse , which are not collected but merely dumped near by . The shacks are clustered around the mouth of Belva No. 1 Mine , because in that mine was where the men of Fourmile made their living . That mine is owned by the Kentucky Straight Creek Coal Company , of which W. E. Lewis  --  he is neither relation nor friend of John L. ? is president . W. E. Lewis is a shrewd businessman who knows how to wring the last penny of profit out of an operation . In Kentucky an employer is allowed to choose whether he will protect his workers and himself by workmen's-compensation insurance or will take his chances on being sued in court for damages if something happens to his employees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he took no chances on being sued . He set up a dummy operating corporation , consisting of himself and his partners , and leased his mine and machinery to it on a royalty basis . The dummy operating company , which legally became the employer of the miners , was set up in Alabama with a total capitalization of $5000 , of which only $1100 was paid in . That became the limit of his liability . Thus , if any of his employees were killed or injured , there was so little they could get from him and his partners that it would be hardly worth while for the men or their widows and orphans to sue . And that is what twenty-four widows and 125 orphans discovered after the explosion which killed their breadwinners . Belva No. 1 is a two-and-a-half-mile drift mine , which means that its main tunnel , or drift , was driven from an opening in the side of a hill reasonably straight and level two and a half miles into the heart of the hill . A drift mine is not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probes diagonally into the earth , or a shaft mine , Wherein the tunnel goes comparatively straight down . But Belva No. 1 was a particularly dangerous mine because its interior was shoddily created and sloppily neglected . The gloomy bowels of a coal mine are filled with Perils unthought of by men who spend their working lives on the face of the earth instead of underneath it , and among them is an invisible , odorless gas known as methane . This is the gas that causes the fabled phenomenon of the will-o ' - the- wisp , sometimes seen flitting over marshes by night , but more often seen in the dark recesses of coal mines Methane is released by rotting vegetation . Since coal is prehistoric vegetation rotted and carbonized under tremendous pressure after ancient upheavals folded it under violently created mountains and hills , methane pours forth whenever coal seams are blasted and torn open by man . Methane is nonpoisonous , but it is a deadly Menace nevertheless . A small amount of it in the air  --  some say as little as 2 V4 per cent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive mixture . The flame of a match , a spark from a hobnailed boot or a miner 's pick ringing against rock , or a tiny electrical arc may set it off . When it ignites , it generates such intense heat that it may set off the finely powdered coal dust present in all mines , and then there is a fiery blast in which mines are shattered and men die . That 's what happened at Belva No. 1 Mine . There was " practically every hazard imaginable " in that mine , and the greatest horror is that most of them could have been avoided or corrected . There were heavy accumulations of coal dust almost everywhere , but no effort was made to allay this potential explosion hazard by rock dusting . Timbering to prevent rock falls was sometimes neglected and in other cases sloppily erected and dangerously inefficient . Fallen debris was allowed to remain blocking passages and escape ways , so that if an explosion occurred , even those men not killed outright could be trapped miles underground until firedamp , carbon monoxide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that 's o ie of the things that did happen in that mine on that day . There are many technical problems involved in keeping a mine reasonably safe , and perhaps chief among them is ventilation . A coal mine is like a huge building honeycombed by many rooms and wandering corridors , the walls of which divert and prevent the free circulation of fresh air . In addition , it is sealed , except for two or three widely separated entrances . Air , then , must be brought in by mechanical means if people are to stay alive in it . At Belva No. 1 mine there was , above all hazards , insufficient ventilation , which meant that dangerous concentrations of methane could build up . That , too , was no secret . Federal inspectors discovered this when a 1941 law for the first time permitted the United States Bureau of Mines to inspect coal mines . In a report issued in 1942 they warned of this and so many other hazards that it took ten pages to list them . But since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report was just a waste of time and paper . Practically nothing was done to abate the menaces . In May , 1944 , a Federal inspector checked the mine again . Again substantially the same perilous cohditions were reported , some of them now worse thiL before . This inspector bluntly warned that " an accumulation and ignition of a methane-air mixture is o a of the major potential hazards present at this mi e . " Copies of this report were sent to the mine owners , the governor of Kentucky and the Kentucky Department of Mines and Minerals . But only a couple of minor improvements , which hardly affected the basic dangerous conditions , resulted from this widespread warning . ( Con tinned an Page 92 ) 17 ( Continued fruits l'ag ? 17 ) In December , 1944 , another Federal mine inspector found the same hazards and issued another grim warning of impending diSaster . Again practically nothing was done about it . Again , in August , 1945 , there was another inspection and another warning . Again nothing was done about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient amounts of air were reaching the working sections , " that " tests for gas are not made , " and that " electrical equipment is installed and maintained with little regard for safety or fire prevention . " This warning was only four months before the practically inevitable catastrophe . The stage was now fully set for tragedy , and curtain time was drawing near . The situation , when the mine closed down on December twenty-second because the next day was Sunday and two days after that was Christmas , was even worse than the Federal inspectors knew . A new entry , which is a tunnel dug to get at or follow a coal seam , had been made . It was called No. 6 entry . The Federal mine-safety code says that when a new entry is made a break-through to the nearest parallel tunnel must be made every sixty feet , so that reasonably fresh air can get to the men at the working face , and methane and other dangerous gases can be diluted and drawn out . But breakthroughs are expensive in man-hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 360 feet without a break-through . The result was that the air at the working face at the end of the entry was foul with noxious gases and triggery with methane . It was there that the explosion originated . There was a final , very obvious cue before death came on-stage . Just before the last shift went off on December twenty-second , what is known as a " feeder " was discovered . A feeder is a prehistoric hole or crack in which methane has accumulated over the ages to such an extent that when it is opened gas can be heard bubbling from it with a sound like that of bubbling water . This feeder was opened by a kerf , or deep , machine-made undercut in the coal seam , to facilitate the blasting of it . This feeder could be heard plainly , and that meant that during the holiday shutdown it would be pouring potentially deadly methane into that poorly ventilated and already dangerous place . But no one did anything about it . Worst , at two A.m. of December twenty-third even the inadequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not started again until sixty-four hours later , and the booster fan was not turned on until six A.M. of December twenty-sixth , only an hour and a half before the men went down into the mine to work . No tests for gas were made . Of the thirty-one men who went down into that mine on that morning after Christmas three years ago , only six survived . The blast came at 8:30 A.M. It was so deep underground and so far back in the heart.of the hill that not a sound was heard nor a rumble felt above ground . The first inkling of disaster was when Derb Harris , a mine employee , walking toward the mine mouth , saw black smoke billow out of it . He knew what that meant . He sounded the alarm . That and the pouring smoke which soon filled the tiny valley around the colliery brought all the outside men and the wives and children of the miners running to the mine mouth with horrified speed . But there were no trained rescue crews ; there was not even fire-fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue crews from other mines arrived and tried to get into the mine . After two days of battling through heavy gas and a literal inferno of flame and smoke from burning coal and debris , the gas-masked and asbestos-clothed rescuers found nine men still alive , though unconscious . These men , saved from the first explosion because they were in another entry , had tried to get out through the one other escape way , but had been balked by a slate fall which had illegally been allowed to remain blocking the way . Retreating , they had barricaded themselves in a side room . That was Bud Town 's idea . Town , a veteran miner , had been through a previous mine disaster , and knew what to do . He scratched arrows on slate walls to guide rescuers , if any came . Just before he sealed the side room with himself and the eight others in it , he scratched on slate piled outside : " Nine miners in here . 11 A.M. Wednesday . " Then he told the men to stretch out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait and pray and hope . Three of the men died after being found , one of them before he could be brought to the surface . The rescuers also found two charred bodies . Then , after five days , they stopped , because of the raging fires inside and because by then all hope of the remaining twenty men being still alive was gone . The bodies of those men were not recovered until nearly three years later . The owners of the mine refused to pay for the crews and materials needed to recover the bodies . The dead men lay ( Continued on Page 95 ) ( Cm , t ire ised from Page 9 ' ) entombed in the mine until the Kentucky legislature , under pressure from the UMW , passed a special bill providing funds for the recovery work . The position of the bodies and other factors showed that several of the men had lived for some hours after the blast  --  until the deadly afterdamp got them . Jun Bain , fifty , was found on his knees beside his final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer . " Another man had written : " Dear God , 3:30 o'clock . . . O.K. " The twenty-four widows and 125 orphans got nothing from the mine owners . Most of them are now living on Federal social-security payments and sums given them from $100,000 raised by the United Mine Workers of America and $40,000 contributed by the general public . Fourteen of the widows are getting $17.90 a month each from social security . Fifty-one children under eighteen are getting $12.35 a month each . The largest social-security payment to any of the bereaved families is $60.60 a month . The six survivors got nothing for their torture and the time they lost from work while recovering from the effects of the blast . This attitude should not be taken as typical of the industry . Officials of the United States Bureau of Mines can not recall another instance in recent years ' n which mine owners refused to pay for the recovery of bodies . Several large companies even fly rescue crews and special equipment at their own expense to stricken mines in which they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation to injured workers and dependents of men killed in their mines are quite rare . Furthermore , the terrible toll of dead and injured in the mines is not , of course , entirely due to negligence of mine operators . Many of the accidents which kill and maim miners are their own fault . Grown calloused to danger through long familiarity with it , some of them become guilty of almost mcredible carelessness . This writer has himself seen coal miners tamp detonator caps  --  which could blow their heads off ? with their teeth . Some harebrained ones will sneak smokes in gassy mines , and more than once a stolen smoke has set off an explosion which killed the smoker and a number of his mates . Hundreds of miners have been killed because some men foolishly misused equipment , such as flame safety lamps . These are ingenious lamps so contrived that while the flame in them can not cause an explosion so long as the lamp is properly handled , the behavior of the flame will tell a trained man whether there is too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These lamps are locked with keys and entrusted only to responsible men such as section foremen , fire bosses and shot firers . In 1917 an explosion in a coal mine in Colorado killed 121 men . Among them was the fire boss , who carried the only flame safety lamp allowed in that mine . The lamp , partially disassembled , was found near his body , and so were matches . Apparent ly the lamp had gone out . Instead of sounding an alarm or at least taking the lamp outside to tinker with it , he had opened it and tried to relight it with a match . Some miners doff their safety helmets as soon as the foreman is out of sight . That makes them more comfort able , but exposes their heads to the bludgeonings of falling slate and stones . Some insist on carrying detonators in their back pockets and blasting powder on their shoulders , despite the obvious fact that one slip may mean that not enough of them will be found to bury . Some fail to wear safety shoes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear specified close-fitting clothing , which is less likely to catch on the murderous teeth of the huge cutting machines or on moving parts of other mine apparatus . Though explosions make the headlines because they are spectacular both by nature and in the number they tam96 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 12,1919 ally kill at one time , they are not the coal miners ' greatest peril . The biggest toll is from run-of-the-mine accidents which each kill only one or two men at a time and which go unnoted , except for a paragraph or two in local coal-town newspapers and miners ' trade journals . One of the most graphic phrases in the American vernacular is " and then the roof fell in . " To the coal miner that is more than just a semijocular figure of speech ; to him it means sudden death . Roof falls and falls of rock , slate , coal and earth from the ribs , or sides , of the mine tunnels have killed more than 35,000 miners in the past forty years . They still kill more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still scamp on timbering , the purpose of which is to keep t he roof and ribs from caving in on them . The Bureau of Mines and the UMW try to drill better sense into the men 's heads . Some large coal companies , particularly those operating the so-called " captive " mines owned by the steel corporations , not only co-operate readily but even initiate safety programs . But in thousands of other mines innumerable hazardous conditions remain neglected by both men and management . Even the " good " mines could be made much safer . But human nature being what it is , it is dream it g in utopian terms to expect either men or management voluntarily to observe all irksome safety measures . The answer seems to boil down to this : the basic reason there is too much blood on coal is that there is no nonpartisan agency , immune to political or economic pressure , empowered to enforce proper safety rules on both sides . That statement may bring outraged squawks from a number of state mining bureaus . Coal is mined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining departments , mine inspectors and mine-safety rules . And in most of those states the mining departments theoretically have the power to enforce safety rules , even to the extent of closing down dangerous mines until the worst hazards are remedied . In actual practice , however , state mining departments , mostly staffed by political appointees , have often been too vulnerable to political and economic pressure . Seldom do state departments close down dangerous mines . Many times after a disaster it develops that the state mining department knew all about the situation for a long time , but pigeonholed reports which might be embarrassing to important people in the . state . Much has already been written about the sordid story back of the Centralia disaster in 1947 in which 111 men died , and of how the politically appointed director of the Illinois Department of Mines and Minerals ignored frantic warnings , even from his own inspectors . The tragedy at Belva No. 1 Mine furnishes perhaps an even more clear-cut example of what happens when enforcement of safety rules is left to state departments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year before the explosion which killed twenty-five men at Belva No. 1 described general safety conditions there as " very , very poor . " He told of detecting explosive gas in four places in the mine . He warned that rock dusting to reduce explosion hazard was " badly " needed . He cited " poor " ventilation , " low oxygen in the workings , " and the fact that " the air was short-circuited about one mile from workings . " He pointed out that the only other escape way from the mine except for the main entrance was " blocked by slate falls . " He closed his report with the blunt statement that " nothing is being done toward safety , and mine law is being absolutely neglected in every respect . " That certainly was plain enough warning of impending disaster . But the state officials did nothing to force the operators of that mine to mend their ways . Under the Kentucky law such reports are not made public . After the mine blew up , it took a court order to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That state inspectors are vulnerable to political pressure is not merely opinion . After the Belva disaster , U. D. Bryant , a Kentucky mine inspector whose district included the Belva Mine , blurted out his heartache and disgust . He did not in exactly those words say that political pressure was behind the failure of the state to act , but he did say , " Inspectors have the responsibility for the lives of all the men in a mine . It is outrageous that they are subject to political pressure . " They should , he added , " be allowed to enforce safety regulations without fear of being removed at the whim or dictate of politicians . " In Kentucky , mine inspectors are appointed by the governor and can be fired " at his pleasure . " The situation there is not much better now , even after the horrible example of Belva No. 1 . The same company which operated that mine is operating two other mines in that area and , according to official reports of the United States Bureau of Mines , conditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in Belva No. 1 . Under present law , however , there is n't anything the bureau can do about it . It is up - LA , the state , but the state seems to be doing little , if anything , about remedying conditions at those mines . It 's much the same in many other states and even worse in some . A few days before this article was written , five men died in a mine at Kitzmiller , Maryland . They died because a gasoline tank fueling an old Model A motor which operated the ventilating fan exploded . The explosion ignited the air ducts , which were of wood . The five men had to plunge into thick smoke and deadly fumes in their desperate effort to escape . They got to within 180 feet of the exit before they collapsed . They were found dead with their heads toward the exit and their faces in their hats . The laws of Maryland prohibit the use of gasoline motors in connection with wooden air ducts , but the Maryland Department of Mines failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hearings held later to determine officially who was to blame for that tragedy . In Oklahoma , mine inspectors are elected , which puts them squarely into politics . The state law does say that they must have had eight years ' experience as miners and be of " temperature ( sic ) habits . " Montana and Arkansas at this writing had only one mine inspector each , though Montana has enough coal mines to produce nearly 4,000,000 tons of coal a year , and Arkansas had an output of about 1,500,000 tons a year . One state had as its main mine inspector a man so monstrously fat that he could not get into many portions of the mines he was supposed to police , and who had to be trundled into other sections on a wheelbarrow . That would be funny except that during five years more than 80 men were killed and nearly 1500 injured in the mines he was supposed to inspect for safety . Even in Pennsylvania , first in the country in total coal production and one of the most enlightened states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and cheer about . There is a particularly poignant story to illustrate this . On September 24 , 1943 , an explosion in the Moffatt and Schrader Coal Company anthracite mine near Mineraville , Pennsylvania , killed fourteen men and injured nine others . There was a threemile-long elliptical conveyor belt in that mine , and at the controls of that con ( Con I in Ned on Page 98 ) ( Continued front Page 96 ) veyor belt was a young man whose father was working in a far recess of the mine . When the explosion came , the young man knew that his father 's first instinct would be to hop onto the conveyor belt in the hope that even if the smoke and fumes made him unconscious , the belt would carry him to fresh air and safety . But the young man also knew that the blast probably had stirred up potentially explosive coal dust and dangerous gases , and that if he allowed the conveyor belt to keep running , sparks and electrical arcs from damaged wires might set off a second blast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shut off the belt he might be dooming his father to death ; if he did not shut it off he might be dooming a score of other men to death . He stopped the belt . There was no second explosion . But his father was found on the halted conveyor belt , killed by fumes . Subsequent investigation showed that the company was guilty of at least nine " flagrant and inexcusable " violations of the Pennsylvania mining laws . Eighteen months later four officials of the company were brought to trial for the violations which cost the lives of fourteen men . They offered no defense . Their punishment consisted of fines of $500 each . If the states wo n't or ca n't do it , who , then , can properly enforce mine safety rules and lessen the bloody toll ? Theoretically , that powerful union , the United Mine Workers of America , could do it . Written into its current contract with the coal operators is the stipulation that the mines must observe Federal safety standards . Realistically , however , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a mine be shut down if there is immediate danger  --  but who should and who can legally define " immediate danger " ? Theoretically the UMW could call its men out on strike from a mine which its safety experts considered dangerous . But there are two roadblocks against such a move . One is the Taft-Hartley Law , under which the UMW could be sued for breaking its contract if it called a strike . That law does say that it should not be construed to make a man work in a " dangerous place . " But , again , who is to interpret to a court and a jury of laymen when a mine is a " dangerous place " ? The second roadblock is even more insurmountable , and its keystone is the human factor . Miners are mostly men who know no other way of making a living , and who dwell in places where the mines are well-nigh the only sources of jobs . Just as a business depends upon satisfied customers , the strength of a union depends mainly upon satisfied members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most men . It would require a mighty brave and noble union official to take it upon himself to order men who had mouths to feed and bills to pay to quit work in a mine because he considered it potentially dangerous . On the other side of the fence , there is the question of whether the job of policing the industry should be left in the hands of a union , which naturally is partisan . It would seem that the operators themselves would prefer a neutral authority . Ironically , one of the worst mine tragedies in recent years was in a mine in which Howard Lewis , a brother of the leader of the mine workers ' union , was the superintendent . That was No. 8 Mine of the Old Ben Coal Corporation , at West Frankfort , Illinois . Several re ports by Federal mine inspectors cited dozens of dangerous conditions in that mine . The last report , in January , 1947 , bluntly warned of serious fire and explosion hazards . But the officials of that mine virtually ignored those reports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in that mine . The Bureau of Mines seems to be the only agency now extant which is capable of solving the problem , if it had the legal right to do so . It has the experts , it has the know-how , and it has been demonstrated that its inspectors , operating on a national level and protected by civil service , are practically immune from pressure by either coal operators or miners . Currently John L. Lewis smiles fondly upon them , but in the past he has damned them as loudly and as vehemently as the coal operators have , and it is highly probable that in the future he will do so again . From the side lines , this damnation by both camps sounds like a testimonial to the neutrality of the Federal inspectors . But right now all they are allowed to do is run safety classes , give expert advice , examine coal mines and issue reports . They have absolutely no power to enforce their findings . Both operators and miners can completely ignore their recommendations , and that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Federal inspectors have been allowed even to examine coal mines and make recommendations . When the Federal Government seized the coal mines in 1946 , a Federal mine-safety code was promulgated for the bituminous-coal industry , and that had at least theoretical teeth in it . But that code lost its legal standing in 1947 . Repeated efforts before and since to give Federal inspectors enforcement powers have consistently been throttled in unfriendly Congressional committees . Even ? the wave of public indignation following the Centralia disaster , which killed 111 men , had no lasting effect . The Senate committee which investigated that explosion said in its report that " the first and most essential step is the enactment by Congress of legislation that will not only raise the standard of safety but give the Federal Government the power it now lacks to enforce that standard . " The committee also declared that " immediate and affirmative action is imperative . " But the 80th Congress killed every measure to that effect , and passed only a toothless one which merely ordered the Bureau of Mines to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the Bureau of Mines the power to enforce mine safety raises the specter of further extension of Federal bureaucratic control . That is admittedly something to ponder and worry about . On the other hand , the lives of thousands of men and the legs and arms and spines and lungs of many more thousands of men are at stake . The most recent full report to Congress by the Bureau of Mines reveals how pressing the problem is . During the fiscal year ending last June , 2184 coal mines were inspected . In 529 of those mines the Federal inspectors found such perilous conditions and such shocking disregard for safety that letters were sent to the governors of nineteen states warning them that " disaster hazards existed or were developing " in certain mines in their states . The letters warned that the stage was set for major tragedy in 104 mines in West Virginia , 89 in Kentucky , 60 in Illinois , 44 in Tennessee , 40 in Pennsylvania , 35 in Alabama , 29 in Ohio , 20 in Oklahoma , 19 in Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Arkansas , 10 in Kansas , 9 in Montana , 8 in Maryland , 7 in Utah , 6 in Wyoming , 5 in New Mexico and 3 in Iowa . From seven states the bureau got no reply at all , and from most of the others it got curt notes which , in effect , told it to go to blazes and mind its own business . Before the bureau made its final report for the year to Congress , it was able to reinspect 1934 of the 2184 mines previously examined that year . On first examination the inspectors had found 27,313 major violations in those 1934 mines . The follow-up inspections revealed that nearly two thirds of those dangerous violations were still wholly or partially uncorrected . Only 34 per cent of the violations were eliminated . Another 15 per cent were partly alleviated . No effort whatsoever was made to correct the remaining 51 per cent of the hazards . That 's one reason why coal miners must pay nearly three times as much for life insurance as men in less hazardous professions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineworkers ' families lack the financial protection of such insurance . This writer has been unable to find a single insurance company which will sell coal miners insurance for occupational accidents at any price . The perils and conditions of coal mining also furnish a clue to the immense power of John L. Lewis . When the toll of dead and injured is coupled with some mine owners ' stubborn resistance to progress , and set against the background of the coal industry 's past record , the mystery of Lewis ' seemingly Svengalilike control over the miners becomes no mystery at all . Lewis ' power is a Frankenstein 's monster created by some of the more shortsighted coal operators . Most coal miners do n't really like John L. Lewis . They resent the dictatorial methods he uses within the union , particularly the fact that he does not allow free elections in some of the locals . If a local chooses officers who do not suit him , he arbitrarily ousts them and installs his own men . There have been times when , as result of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal-mining towns without bodyguards to protect him against the members of his own union . The operators could have stopped Lewis cold long ago if they voluntarily had given the men a better break . Instead Lewis had to wring and batter bitterly fought concessions from them , step by step . The miners saw Lewis doing this successfully , and savored the benefits he wrested for them . They came to the conclusion that it took a blustering , dictatorial character such as he , as tough as the coal operators whom they considered their feudal enemies , to fight their battles for them . That 's why there came a time when this unpopular man could bring nearly a half million miners out of the mines with merely an indirect hint that that was what he wanted them to do to back up his play against the operators . The result is that he has been able to get more for his members than any other union leader , and to become perhaps the most powerful labor leader in this country . At this writing , some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was to be introduced into the 1949 Congress , giving Federal inspectors the power to enforce mine-safety regulations . In view of the political complexion and probable mood of the new Congress , such a bill seems to stand a chance of passing in this session , no matter how fiercely some operators oppose it . Such operators seem not to realize that by stubborn resistance they are playing Lewis ' own game . If such a bill passes  --  as almost inevitably it must , sooner or later  --  their bitter struggle to kill it will only insure that John L. Lewis , the man they hate and fear the most , will get all the credit for it , and that he will thus become stronger than ever .
