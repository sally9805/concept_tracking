Among the opportunists , perverts , gangsters and men of distorted genius who rose to power in Hitler 's Germany , Dr. Robert Ley was an exception . The boss of Germany 's Labor Front was a rather ordinary little man , fond of his bottle and frantically fervent in his adulation of Hitler and Naziism . " National Socialism has made an end to the bone-softening doctrine of life negation , " he once said . " Germans are fanatics of life . " When he was arrested last May , he moaned : " Life without Hitler does not mean a damn thing to me . " <P> He meant what he said . One evening last week , in his war criminal 's cell at Nrnberg , Robert Ley hanged himself . <P> He left a testament to " My German People . " It told them that their worst mistake had been antiSemitism , counseled them to make amends : " The Jew should make a friend out of Germany and Germany a friend out of the Jew . " He also gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good days . . . and I want to be with him now in the black days . "
