A MAN who had lived two years in Rus- sia said to me , shortly after I returned after spending ten weeks there : " The question that really stumped me when I got back was , ' What did you find in Russia that you did n't expect before you went ? ' I could n't think of a thing that had surprised me . " I found surprises wherever I went . The first thing I noticed after our Berlin-to-Moscow plane crossed the Soviet border surprised me : the lack of motion . Russia has a static quality . America is a large country with static stretches . I remember once rising before dawn on the Utah-Nevada border and driving west ; in the first 150 miles along the road I saw only two cars . But I am here talking about the great area of European Russia which is as thickly settled as America 's Middle West , with towns or villages every few miles or oftener . You see surprisingly little motion there . When you fly in America , even over mountain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle West you see a maze of them , carrying heavy traffic . We flew into Russia at 1,500 feet . It was diamond-clear ; I saw men walking along the roads . But in the five hundred miles to the outskirts of Moscow , I saw just two trains . Not one single motor vehicle was visible , even in cities like Vilno and Vitebsk . Nor will I soon forget a Soviet airplane ride from Stalingrad to Moscow , when we flew almost the whole six hundred miles at a hundred-foot altitude , on occasion dropping to forty feet or less , so that I sometimes looked up at church steeples beyond our wingtips . The pilot sent back word that he wanted the Americans on board to see Russia , " and then zoomed down to ten feet over the river Don so that our propellers sucked up drops of water and turned them into a misty rainbow spray . Flying at a hundred feet for hundreds of miles , you do see everything ? with a new and startling clarity . I saw the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields and up the hillsides ; the gun emplacements in gulches and on bluffs ; the burnt-out tanks , some of them freshly plowed round and one a rusting brown-red in a vast green expanse of winter wheat that lapped up to the very tank treads . I saw two constantly recurring signs that we were in Soviet Russia : decaying churches and great collective barns . Nearly all those churches We brushed past were falling to pieces even in towns untouched by war , their roofs caved in , the plaster peeling from their walls and steeples , and the onion bulbs on top of the steeples only skeletons . The barns on collective farms were big structures , dominating their villages like grain elevators in the Dakotas or Catholic churches in Quebec . It was a bird's-eye view all right . Chickens ran for shelter from us as though we were hawks . Cows completely lost their dignity . Flocks of sheep huddled madly together from every part of their pasture . Only the roads and rails were still and lifeless as we roared past . In these six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw one stationary train , no trains in motion , one paved road , and not one car or tr tick . There is almost no motor transport in Russia in the American sense of the word . You can drive out a bit from some of the main cities ; I went about a hundred miles from Moscow , much less from Leningrad and Stalingrad . The roads are bumpy and bad , and I got stuck both in winter snows and spring mud . Now I know why , as Pravda reported in 1946 , a high Soviet official in the Stavropol district abandoned his car and fatalistically took to moving about his district on horseback/ There are a few longdistance highways in Russia . I met one sturdy Englishman who had driven the five hundred miles from Minsk to Moscow . He saw only five other cars and relatively few trucks until he got close to the capital . When the gas supply he carried ran out , he had to buy some black-market gas from the Soviet secret police . His car had never been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the current Five Year Plan calls for 7,200 miles of new surfaced roads ? or less than the total surfaced roads in Connecticut , with its mere 5,009 square miles ! Since the war , Stalin has told several American visitors that Russia needs four times as many railroads as its 53,163 miles , which would still give it less trackage than America 's 226,696 . But the Five Year Plan calls for only 4.500 miles of new rail lines by 1950 . The plan calls for an increase in Soviet river and canal transport to 50 billion ton miles in 1950 . If this is achieved , the Soviet inland waterways will for the first time have caught up with the czarist system in amount of goods moved . Russia 's seagoing merchant fleet is relatively small , and the Nazis destroyed or damaged all four Soviet shipbuilding cities . Nothing in what I 'd read or heard before I went to Russia had really prepared me for this static quality , and it may surprise others as much as it did me . Russia 's communications system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and uncertain , few Russians have phones . As one Soviet official in Russia remarked to me : " The only way a telephone is of much use is to have your secretary make appointments for you to go see people , or for them to come see you . A telephone is too hard to hear over . " The Soviet phone model is almost an antique ; it is hard to hear over , even when the secret police have not tapped it . No nation can approach its full industrial potential until it has first-rate communications and transport . If you think of a business man in Nashville writing steadily for five months to a Seattle manufacturer , finally hearing he can have one-third of his original order , and then bombarding Seattle with intermittent letters , phone calls , and telegrams for eight more months before finally getting a shipment of half that third ? and having something almost that slow and discouraging happen with every transaction involving goods and transport ? you will have some idea of what postwar Russia is like . Naturally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way from having a modern or adequate system of transport and communications . It still is . II A NOTHER thing that surprised me about Russia was the waste . Other nations are wasteful . We know how America has squandered resources , and have heard the Frenchwoman 's crack that she could feed her family for a week on the food an English family wasted in a week ( she could not do it now ) . But no nation in history has wasted on so prodigal a scale as the Soviet Union . One Soviet citizen who knew his country very well told me just before I went there that an outstanding characteristic of Soviet life was the number of people it took to get anything done . He is right . Part of it is fear , which in Russia does sometimes seem pathological . The most unlikely places are guarded , as well as every conveivable likely one . The Soviet Army is much the biggest in the world . Long after the war , I saw as many men in military uniform on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in London or Washington . ( The count did not include the many ex-soldiers who , possessing no other clothes , still wore their old uniform with the insignia removed . ) For a country as critically short of manpower as Russia since the war , that is shocking waste ? to consider it from no other angle . The last thing I saw in Russia was that sort of waste . My train from Leningrad to Finland halted four times in the border area , and over one hundred ablebodied young security police guarded this one three-car train on its stops . even though it had already been searched from stem to stern with the minuteness of which my examination was a sample . A uniformed group appeared from the nearest settlement every time we stopped , and stood on all sides . What is one to make of a country that uses so many men between eighteen and thirty to guard one small train near the border of a small disarmed neighbor ? It seemed sheer madness to waste manpower this way . When I said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached view : " Why worry ? If Russia wants to waste men , it will suffer more than anybody else . " Another part of the waste is inefficiency , not only the unproductiveness of men in uniform and in the world 's most top-heavy 11 bureaucracy , but the human inefficiency that . is unavoidable under Soviet conditions . I do not primarily mean the ten to fifteen million Russians in slave-labor camps , though slave labor is almost as wasteful of output as 2 it is of human happiness . I mean the way the average Russian and his wife have to use up almost all their energies just to keep going . I gnashed my teeth or had a lump in my throat whenever I saw what Soviet waste meant to the ordinary Russian . There are pitifully few consumer goods for these poor , hard-working people ; those few are so pitifully shoddy . A Kansas housewife would not be caught cleaning her cellar in most of the dresses / saw women wearing in the orchestra and dress circle of the Bolshoi Theater ? Russia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crocodile , the only humor magazine in a land where public humor must be as official as anything else , prints jokes about shoddiness so regularly that the Kremlin must be trying to get Russians to i laugh off their sorrows on the subject . A Crocodile cartoon showed two climbers roped together high on a mountain . One says , " Afraid of the cliff ? " The other answers , " No , I 'm afraid of the rope . My factory made it . " In another , a woman asks : " Do you have any children 's bicycles ? " The clerk says : " Buy this tricycle . When your child rides it , a wheel will fall off . " To most Russians , unfortunately , Crocodir " laughter is as hollow as crocodile tears . The Soviet Union is excellent at names and slogans : . collective farms , Five Year Plans , Order of the Red Banner of Labor , Mother of Maternal Glory for a woman with five children , etc. , etc . Soviet Russia often manages to fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new label . A lot of waste effort arises from this practice . Label-pasting is not peculiar to the Russians . I saw a diverting instance of it during my wartime service in the State Department . When I left for London , Cordell Hull , who had long been an able Secretary , was aging and less active . Under-Secretary Edward R. Stettinius was dashing up and down the long , high . slatdoored halls of the old State Department building with a bunch of charts in one hand and a bucket of pastel-toned paint in the other , serenely certain that with reorganization and redecoration he could change State overnight . When I returned , the paint was fading and State had undergone a second complete Stettinius " reorganization , " he having become Secretar.y . Every office , division , and employee in State had had titles changed twice in my absence . Everyone I knew was sitting in the same old place , doing the same work . The Soviet Union has done a more thorough restaging than that since 1917 , but Mother Russia still speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " collectivized " and " tractorized " but the change on them is not anything near as thorough as I would have thought from the newsreels . Everything in Russia is now " planned " ? but Soviet plans work like any other human plans , which is not perfectly . There is definitely more propaganda in Soviet plans than in those of the ' Western world . ONE surprise I had about Soviet planning concerned the Palace of the Soviets . For years I had been hearing stories and seeing pictures of this mighty edifice , which was to outtop any building in the world and be surmounted with a three hundred-foot stainless-steel statue of Lenin infinitely more inspiring than the Empire State Building 's mooring mast for blimps or the Chrysler Building 's toothpick . The Palace was to be Something Symbolic , - the epitome of the planned perfection of the Soviet state . When the Nazi invasion began , the unfinished steel skeleton of the Palace did serve a highly symbolic purpose . Since metal was short , Stalin decreed that the framework be taken down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone pointed out the high board fence around the site . One slushy March afternoon I strolled over to investigate . The only gate in the long circuit of the fence was heavily crisscrossed with rusty wire . I finally found that a near-by courtyard ( where a soldier , as in so many Moscow courtyards , was guarding a couple of German cars and three American lendlease trucks ) led onto a little ridge at one side of the excavation . Its circular hole , dug down some fifty feet , looked like a prodigious bomb crater . In the center were several acres of concrete Foundation , flat like a pavement , and on it a double circle of huge concrete teeth ? a twenty-century Stonehenge , the base for the 1,400 cylindrical tower . Four rusty cranes slanted off at an angle . That was all . It was impressive . The next day I mentioned to a foreigner who has long lived in Moscow that I had gone over the site of the Place of Soviets . Chuckling , " It 's never going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you build a skyscraper anywhere , you test the subsoil first , taking borings to see if it will stand the weight of the structure . In this planned state , they had n't bothered about that . They simply picked the site they wanted because it was handy , right across the Moscow River from the Kremlin ; blew up the city 's biggest cathedral , because it was on the site ; and in the early thirties dug down that fifty feet . Then they found the whole subsoil affected by river seepage . The Kremlin was quietly frantic . It had told the whole world what it was going to build , where it was going to build it ? and how high it would be . When Russian engineers admitted that they could do nothing , American engineers were called in to rescue this Soviet symbol . They warned Stalin that the task was probably hopeless , but he asked them to try anyway . They tried for two years , taking all sorts of borings , and pumping in quantities of concrete and other reinforcements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised Stalin that , while the site could take a fair-sized structure , it would never bear the one planned and proclaimed . In 1937 , all . work stopped on the site . The cranes have been there rusting ever since . The Kremlin found one excuse after another for delaying work until 1941 , then leaped at the chance for a patriotic dismantling of what little had been erected . Since 1945 , the Kremlin has used postwar reconstruction problems as justification for not resuming . A highly paced Soviet engineer told a foreign colleague who asked when work on the Palace would be resumed : " It wo n't be . The original plan has been officially abandoned . But that is secret . The Kremlin is still too embarrassed to admit it . " There is the hole in the ground . Russians still ' point pridefully at the fence , with the four cranes jutting above it like giraffes ' heads . You can still see little replicas of the Palace in Moscow second-hand shops . They are no longer sold at the other stores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began boasting to me about the Palace of the Soviets . When I told her the truth , she was enraged . " You are trying to blacken our dreams , " she said . Even a materialist regime must leave its people a few dreams ? especially when . it has done so little for them materially . HI D ESPITE the fact that the Russians are good haters , and that the Kremlin plays upon this trait to make them hate nonCommunist nations , you quickly feel great affection for them . They can be as kind as they are cruel . Very few of them know the meaning of moderation , but still fewer know the meaning of avarice . They have so little , most of their lives are so near the knife edge of terrible want that they often fight quite frantically for a toe-hold on a trolley or a few sticks of wood for their stove . But once they have managed to grab their tiny share , they are again very friendly . They will help the next fellow get his or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their little . Moscow subway scrimmages are even bitterer than those in Manhattan . But once aboard , Russians are again very generous . The Moscow subway has many beggars , and they reap a tidy havest . One evening an old beggar with straggly gray beard passed through my car . Nearly everyone dropped something into his outstretched cap . Two factory girls sitting across from me were chewing sunflower seeds . ( Russians chew these much as Americans chew gum . ) The two girls whispered . Then each took a handful of the seeds from her pocket , and one girl clutching the double handful ran after him and dumped them in his cap . He smiled gratefully ; this was a real windfall . Meanwhile , a bespectacled office girl with two heavy bundles seized the opportunity and the temporarily vacant seat . When the factory girl returned a moment later , a short sharp argument ensued . " That 's my seat . " " You left it . " " But you saw why I did ? one ought to give to a beggar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " You selfish office pig . " " Use any names you like . I 'm above that ? and I 'm keeping this seat . " The factory girl had to stand . Moscow celebrated its eight hundredth birthday in September 1947 . The city as a whole and its fire department and subway received the Order of Lenin ; the trolleys were presented with the Order of the Red Banner ; the waterworks got the Order of the Patriotic War , First Class . The subway system , while short and jammed , is the only clean one I know except London 's ; squads of women are endlessly swabbing down its stations . No non-Russian would give the other city services a medal . They are , frankly , terrible by American standards . The contrast in Russia 's capital is between a few showy things for the elite and almost nothing for the masses . Get off the occasional show avenue like Gorki Street ( even the show streets are very spotty ) , and you soon wonder at Soviet propaganda about " Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slum , most of which has had no street or sidewalk repair since the Revolution . These areas are littered with refuse . Within a thousand feet of the Kremlin , there are slums as bad as anything in Naples or Harlem . Moscow 's best is not as good as what Naples or Harlem can offer . Moscow has thousands of log houses , sometimes an acre full of them alongside a ten-story apartment house . In the winter , men are constantly pushing snow off the roofs while women shovel it in the main streets . You buck through the drifts on the side streets as best you can . In the summer , the same women hose down the main streets to keep them a little less dusty . Even here , Russians know better than to disobey their set orders . A sprinkling cart was operating near the Kremlin one dry day when a storm sprang up . Though the rain was pelting down , the cart kept right on sprinkling ! To stroll even fifty miles around Moscow ( I walked over three hundred there ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Soviet capital . A few streets have been widened , more or less at random ; a few new buildings constructed , even more at random . In a city of a little motor traffic and millions of pedestrians , sidewalks on the main thoroughfares are so narrow that many people have to walk in the streets , where they frequently get hit . T HE crowds are as drab as their Communist capital . As one American said to me : " All the clothes in Russia look like one big rummage sale . " Russians are so short of everything that they think a U. S. mail-order catalogue as magical as Aladdin 's lamp . An old copy of Vogue sells for $125 because the dresses it illustrates are so much better looking than anything Russian . An American woman showed a group of Russian women a half-dozen copies of Vogue . They asked which was the latest year , as they wanted to see the newest styles . She explained that they were all the same year , that Vogue comes out twice a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one of them declared , " for any country to publish such a remarkable magazine more than one a year . " Clothes themselves cost much more than the Vogue I met one Russian important enough to have been sent to Moscow by his Siberian city on a purchasing mission . He had rags wrapped round his feet . His shoes had been stolen in a public bath the day after he arrived and he could not possibly afford to buy another pair . An American couple lived for some time in a room and bath at a Moscow hotel . One day the hotel 's assistant manager came to the wife and said : " Would madam please be more fair in how she leaves things ? " It developed that one maid cleaned the bath , and another the bed-living room . Each room had a wastebasket , and one of the maids ' most coveted tips was what went into them . Not realizing this , the American couple had been putting most of their empty bottles , bits of food , cigarette butts , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained about the discrimination . After that , they were very careful to distribute these favors fairly . I spent part of one afternoon at a market , near Pushkin Square , where collective farmers sold food grown on their own small personal holdings . City folk lined the alley that led into the stalls , selling bits of their belongings to raise money for food . Among their offerings were postcards of the Gibsongirl era , three second-hand toothbrushes , a pair of children 's rubbers , two light bulbs , a battered saucepan , several hairpins , and a large tin bathtub . One frail white-haired lady who strikingly resembled my seventyfour-year-old Aunt Pauline was holding up a soiled pillow with bare blue-veined hands in the freezing March weather . A woman asked her the price ? $18 ? as I passed , and drew out a chicken feather through the one hole in the casing to test the stuffing . The $18 could buy less than two pounds of butter in the market itself . Inside the market enclosure , policemen eyed the crowd as it milled past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent two hours moving slowly up and down along the stalls . People priced , haggled , and when they made a deal produced their own bottles or cans for milk , and their own newspapers to wrap the food . Russian dailies are used for a variety of other functions , from cigarette to toilet paper . As the winter twilight closed in , people began leaving . The peasants had a long way to go , first by bus or train and then on foot . City people could linger a little later , though in Moscow 's slow , overburdened , bemedaled transport system they might well take a couple of hours to get a few miles . As I edged through the ice-covered alley toward the street that would lead me back to Pushkin 's statue , passed the frail old lady with the soiled pillow . She was still holding it up , her hands bluer than ever . T HE people were the single most impressive thing I saw in Russia . They made the Red Square May Day parade my single most impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May Day Parade could ever possibly underestimate the might and magnificance of Russia . I stood at one spot and watched a million people walk by . I have seen Bastille Day crowds in Paris and Holy Week crowds jamming St. Peter 's in Rome and the great square outside . I have seen the Easter parades of Seville , Spain . In Britain I have seen the processions and vast crowds for a king 's funeral and a king 's coronation . 1 have seen the crowds at Coney Island on a hot summer Sunday . They all shrink beside a Moscow May Day . I do not mean the military part of the parade , which took up the first hour . The troops , the tanks , the trucks , the guns were well deployed but nothing special . The 310 airplanes ( which included only five fourengined planes , three of them bombers ) were not impressive compared to Western nations ' air spectacles . Nor do I mean the appearance of Stalin and other members of the Politburo on the reviewing level atop Lenin 's tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy array of uniformed secret police officers ? not soldiers , every one of them was an officer ? flung all four sides of the tomb and kept alert through the long parade by being replaced with files of fresh officers every half hour . These officers first appeared a few minutes before the Politburo put in its appearance . After the military part of the parade , extra files of secret policemen were marched in to line the entire circuit of Red Square , before the people were allowed in for their " spontaneous demonstration . " Across the hundred-yard cobbled width of Red Square , other files of troops were placed every fifteen feet , stretching the whole length of the square from the Historical Museum on the west to St. Basil 's Cathedral on the east . These troops stood literally shoulder to shoulder and alternately faced opposite directions so they could watch everybody . Every third one of these troops was also a secret policeman ; the rest were picked soldiers from the Kremlin 's crack Guards Divisions . These twenty files of troops split the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty parallel pieces of spaghetti , and of course controlled and directed the people every instant they were in Red Square . When Stalin arrived , just as the Kremlin clock struck ten , he came through the graypainted door under the small turret in the Kremlin wall directly behind the tomb . On either side of this door are the black marble squares behind which are the ashes of Communist heroes buried in the Kremlin wall , including one American , John Reed . He swung round the tomb and walked up the steps on its front , Red Square side to the lower reviewing level , accompanied by the Politburo , a few other top Soviet figures , and some hemedaled secret police officers . Then he mounted the steps to the upper reviewing level all by himself , to a patter of applause from the small crowd of pass-holders . Once he was up there in the center , alone , the other leaders started up , with Molotov in the van . They grouped themselves on either side of him . But the Leader had first made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plain military top coat and uniform , with no visible medal or decoration , contrasted sharply with the other uniformed figures up there ? who all dripped medals , ribbons , and jeweled orders . Stalin occasionally moved from side to side of the forty-foot reviewing walk on top of the tomb , to stretch his Legs . But he never sat down , and he never long stopped waving in acknowledgement of the cheers . He was within sixty feet when he came to the end of the reviewing walk nearest me , and through powerful field glasses I had several good , unhurried looks at him . He is a short man , even among his short companions . He has a sallow complexion ; it sees little sunlight . His hair and mustache were grayer than I expected ; his features had life and expression when he talked , and once or twice chuckled , with his associates . Otherwise hisface was an . impassive mask , with many wrinkles and pockmarks that do not show in his official photographs . It is the strongest face I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " steel " for his Party name . The only other glimpse I had of Stalin was in his box at the Bolshoi Theater . He enters this box , at stage level just to the left of the orchestra pit , after the lights have gone down and the curtain up , so the audience 's attention will be concentrated on the stage . He similarly leaves just before the end of each act , returning only when the curtain has again risen . He sits in a corner of the box shielded from the audience , so the only time one sees him there is when he draws aside the curtain at the door of the box to enter or leave . Then some people in certain parts of the theater can see him silhouetted for a moment against the light of the passage outside . ( His favorite Bolshoi performance is reportedly Tchaikovsky 's opera " Eugene Onegin . " ) Hundreds of secret policemen are everywhere in the Bolshoi whenever lie is there ? two at the back of each box and others sprinkled thickly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits and the fact they never talk to anybody or watch the performance . Such are the precautions to keep Russia 's leader from assassination ? far greater than those for a President . the only American official so protected . ( Three American Presidents have been assassinated since 1865 ; in that period only one czar , Alexander II in 1881 , and one Politburo member , Sergei Kirov in 1934 , have been assassinated , both in the city that is now Leningrad . ) In the Soviet system , not one man but thousands are constantly protected . For weeks before that May Day parade I had seen various civilian columns around Moscow practicing for their part in this " spontaneous " people 's demonstration . That , plus all the guards I saw in Red Square , made me a bit cynical about this " people 's " part of the proceedings before it started . But nothing prepares one for that parade . What a milling mass of humanity it was . This , in the living , slowly moving flesh is the great flowing tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief single characteristic of this vast land . Part of the procession was in organized groups . Most of it was people , just sauntering along . Whole families were there : mothers walking hand in hand with little girls and boys , fathers with still smaller children on their shoulders . There were not only endless pictures of Stalin and the Politburo ; endless red flags ; endless factory , club , shop , and organization floats and banners . There were kids tugging at toy balloons and occasionally , as at any circus , losing their grip so the gay-colored bubbles floated up over the crowd . This slow , steadily moving mass goes on hour after hour after hour the whole great width and length of Red Square , without ever a break or gap or pause . A voice over the loudspeaker regularly bade those in the square to " Hurrah for Stalin ! " ( " Hurrah " is the same word in Russian as in English . ) Those opposite the tomb always did , though there was never a cheer from the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came by turned their faces quite naturally and spontaneously up toward Stalin and the leaders on the tomb . Shifting the range of my field glasses around through the crowd , I could see that most of them were smiling . The children especially would wave and cheer . At last this seemingly endless stream of humanity did gradually taper to an end . It was Russia that had passed in the shape of her greatest strength : her patient , pliant , almost tireless people who can make up for almost any stupidity , brutality , or miscalculation of their masters . The Russian people did that against the Tartars . Napoleon , and the Nazis . They would do it against any other invader . No procession I am ever likely to see will have the force , impact or sheer spendor of those million ragged people . V B ur my greatest surprise in Soviet Russia was the sudden , deep happiness I had at being an American . I have spent more than five years of my life abroad , in over twenty countries . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to me . I am not one of those who says , " My country , right or wrong . " Our country has often been wrong . It is wrong in some ways now . We must try to correct as many of the wrongsas we can they help explain why Communism is so strong . But when you live awhile in Russia , you are glad to be an American . Since leaving Russia , I have often thought of a woman border inspector who , when I told her I was going to write about my Russian visit , asked me to " write with the heart . " I could not answer her then . She and the captain who accompanied her were in the Soviet security police . Even if , by some chance , they had both secretly agreed with me , each of them would nevertheless have had to report fully on the " propaganda " they had heard . If only one had reported , it would have gone badly with the other . Yes , I should have told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pale faces . I shall remember that you want peace and many things besides peace . You want a real people 's state , for instance , and freedom of movement in your own country and abroad . You can not move anywhere , say to Moscow , without the state 's permission . If you have no permit , you are sentenced to hard labor . You can not even visit places like the Kremlin . I shall remember the Russian girl I met only once for a few minutes , during which we happend to walk past it . She said : " We Russians envy you foreigners . You can visit the Kremlin . We can not . " I shall remember the farm youth who was born the year your farms were collectivized . He asked : " Do you have collective farms in America ? " When I said no , and added that I myself owned a farm , he said : " I would like land of my own . If I farmed it well , I would get something from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would be the one who suffered . Either way it would be up to me . " I shall remember the Soviet intellectual to whom I quoted that statement . His comment was : " We can very seldom say it now , but Russians are more like Americans than you might think . " Your rulers , I wanted to say to him , tell you many harsh things about America . They paint a very grim picture of life here . Yet any American who visits the Soviet Union comes away deeply aware that . for all his country 's shortcomings , America has a most precious heritage : freedom . Not the four freedoms , or this freedom or that one . Freedom .
