One day last winter a young textile worker went to Manhattan 's Neurological Institute . He complained of " spells . " Whenever he took a nip of alcohol , coffee , tea or cola drinks , said he , the result was startling : he would lose control of his muscles and leap like a jitterbug . His cavorting was invariable : he curved his fingers like claws , walked on the outside of his feet and jerked his legs in the air . Sometimes he twisted his head to one side , curled his lips in a sneer , and rolled his eyes upward , mumbling and clucking to himself . The only way to stop an attack was to lie down and go to sleep . <P> Drs . Lester Adran Mount and Samuel Reback examined him , found him " pleasant , placid and cooperative . " Aside from his spells , he was in perfect health , showed " high average general intelligence . " Nobody in the Institute had ever seen or read or heard tell of anything like it . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drs . Mount and Reback described the dance , christened it " paroxysmal choreoathetosis " ( from the Greek choreia , meaning dance , and athetos , not still ) . Their patient told them that his great-grandfather had spells over 100 years ago , had passed them on to 27 descendants , now spread all over the U. S. <P> In an effort to discover the cause of his attacks , the doctors gave the young man a dozen different drugs , from common salt to pituitary extract , doused him in tubs of hot and cold water , sent him running up &; down 15 flights of stairs . Still whiskey , etc. would send him into his dance . Nothing would cure him . He finally packed up and went home , resolved never to touch a drop again . One thing that consoled him : his leaping great-grandfather had lived to the ripe age of 87 ; his great-aunt , 72 , and great-uncle , 81 , were still dancing around the old homestead in the South . <P> The doctors chalked up another name for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
