The views of Vice President Henry A. Wallace can not be labeled as the views of the U.S. Government . His unique position in the Administration leaves him free to express opinions which a President or a Secretary of State could not publicly state . Last week he stated such an opinion . <P> " We shall decide some time in 1943 or 1944 , " he said , " whether to plant the seeds of World War III . That war will be cer tain if we allow Prussia to rearm either materially or psychologically . That war will be probable in case we double-cross Russia . . . . Unless the Western democracies and Russia come to a satisfactory understanding before the war ends , I very much fear that World War III will be inevitable . " <P> Exactly what the Vice President meant by " double-cross " was not clear . The context of the speech suggested that he meant there might be a reaction in the U.S. after the war which would make the U.S. fascist and anti-Russian . But even without clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what the Vice President said that the U.S. has no real understanding with Russia on postwar issues . <P> In Britain the Wallace speech was warmly praised . It closely paralleled the views of the London Times ( see col. 1 ) . Said the Manchester Guardian : " There is a hundred times more anti-Russian feeling in the United States now than there is in this country , and much more tolerance for fascist systems of government . That is , of course , why Mr. Wallace made the speech . " <P> There was no comment in Russia , but Russian newspapers printed the speech . Perhaps the best indication of the reception of the speech and the mood of the Kremlin was the friendly Russian reaction to some other words , not so favorable to Russia .
