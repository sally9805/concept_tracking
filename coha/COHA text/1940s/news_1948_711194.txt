txt Government control nas oecome Britain 's biggest industry and a standard music hall joke . The Board of Trade produced an edict that metal discs be attached to the horns of pedigreed Angus bulls being exported . Later the order was amended : it required instead that the horns should be branded . Then it was revoked  --  the board discovered Angus bulls do n't have horns at all An Australian married in Britain sent pieces of wedding cake home to friends . His packages were returned empty with an official note that " confectionary may not be exported . " A regulation N.:221 dreamed up to prohibit picking or sale of small green onions . The simple British farmer was given to understand that " diameter shall be construed as meaning the maximum diameter of the bulb measured at right angles to the axis through the bulb and shoot . " An American businessman in Britain wanted to accept a typewriter being sent to him from his home office in the U. S No money was involved , yet he had to get an import license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : three months to get the license . When it turned out the typewriter was of a different make than specified , the license had to be altered That took another three months . A group of former Polish soldiers was trained at considerable expense to make surgical instruments . They were to be absorbed in British industry , so set up in business in pre-fab huts . Needing more space , they decided to build additional huts . For this they required a building license . Their application was turned down . So back they went to their resettlement center , to be retrained in some other line of work . It Takes Toil Controls like . these can not be effortlessly conceived and administered . They spring from the devoted toil of a vastly swollen army of public servants . The honest efforts of these honest civil workers is driving the honest British public into much law evasion . Britons are breaking many of their tangled rules %est/lout even knowing it  --  but they are also breaking and dodging many quite knowingly , in order to eat what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do business , or move from place to place . Consider their plight : The Ministry of Food with its rations tells 47 million Britons what to eat for breakfast , lunch and dinner . The Board of Trade decides how much clothing they can buy . The Ministry of Health controls the building and repair of homes The Ministry of Fuel determines which of them may drive an auto  --  and where they go in it . The Treasury prescribes which foreign countries they may visit . The Ministry of Agriculture has the last word on who can kill a pig . The Ministry of Supply parcels out steel and other supplies to industry . Butterworth 's Service These are only a few examples of the story wrapped up in some 25.000 rules and regulations which harness the life of every British man , woman and child . Together these orders , shrouded in painful and often almost unintelligible legal language , fill six hefty volumes known as " Butterworth 's Emergency Legislation Service . " You can go through the alphabet of regulation ? anchovies and antiques , beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clothes rationing , are household by-words to most Britons . Others are obscure or unknown in the public mind . Violation of any one " of them carries a penalty . Sometimes the penalty is thousands of dollars The government as boss of Britain 's planned economy has become the nation 's biggest employer . Presently its payroll numbers over two million . Regular government agencies like the Board of Trade . Treasury and Home Office ? the administrative agencies of this brave new Britain  --  boast a corps of some 700,000 civil servants . Before the war , there were only about 300.000 in these departments . Wartime rationing of food , clothing and other items in short supply led to new controls . and in some cases entirely new agencies to swell the ranks of the British civil service . Now they are semi-permanent fixtures in the British way of life . For example , the Food Ministry , a warborn agency , boasts a staff of about 50,000 . Of these , about 2,000 are busy lust rationing bread The Ministry of Fuel  --  formerly the pint-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 6.176 trying to conserve power resources and ration gasoline . Another newcomer , the Ministry of National Insurance , has 15,737 employes on its payroll to keep tabs on a new cradle-tograve insurance scheme . Still another newcomer is the Ministry of Supply , which employs 38,134 . As for the old line agencies . the Board of Trade , whose pre-war staff numbered around 4,248 , has swollen to 14.566 as boss of government activities connected with industry and trade including everything from clothes rationing to the export drive . The Ministry of Works with a prewar staff of 6,273 now has 20,190 as controller of building other than housing . The Office of Inland Revenue has doubled its pre-war staff and now maintains 48.460 employes handling Britain 's increasingly complicated taxes . It Costs More Costs of maintaining this corps of bureaucrats have more than doubled from pre-war Taxpaying Britons now foot an estimated $1.4 billion annual bill to maintain them , as compared with a pre-war $600 million . Salaries are still relatively low . Highest paid civil servant is hardworking Sir Edward Bridges , permanent secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's paid $13.000 annually . Next in line is the permanent secretary of each of the Other ministries . Each earns $14,000 annually . And the deputy secretaries are paid $10,000 a year . At the other end of the ladder embryonic bureaucrats such as 14-year-old " juvenile typists " earn around $400 annually , stenographers , $832 , and secretaries , $1,400 a year . Beyond the civil service are the nationalized industries such as transport with 800,000 workers and electricity with 120.000 . They are supposed to pay their own way but are responsible to various ministers on policy matters  --  for example the National Coal Board is accountable to Fuel Minister Hugh Gaitskell . So they are part of the government bureaucracy . More Manpower Administration of nationalized industries often demands more workers than it did under private enterprise The National Coal Board now employs 22.000 administrative workers as compared with about 16,000 under private ownership . Around 1.000 are employed at the board 's headquarters in London . the remainder of the administrative staff being scattered throughout the hoards ' eight divisional and 50 area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively low compared to those paid by private enterprise , particularly in the higher brackets For example , Lord Hyndlcy. board chairman and a former industry man , earns $34,000 yearly . The average salary of other administrative officers runs between $2,400 and $2,800 yearly . Clerks and typists get anything from $676 to $832 yearly . However , salaries of many employes in the nationalized industries are higher than those paid to regular civil servants , because they were taken over from private enterprise . War Minister Emanuel Shinwell thinks salaries of top-drawer officials of the nationalized industries are too high and warns they must prep ? re for a cut . Many here feel that the state will lose these officials to private industry if their salaries are axed  --  for there still are some private posts to which they could flee . Government control in the socialist manner dates back to the 1939 and 1940 Emergency Power Acts to mobilize for war . The emergency powers had to be renewed annually by Parliament . Voted In Retention of controls was a major issue in the 1945 general election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Britain was destined for a controlled economy so long as it remained in power . Parliament with its big labor majority passed the Supplies and Services Act which allowed the government to continue until 1950 all controls and regulations made under the old 1939 and 1910 Emergency Powers Acts . At the same time it also armed itself with new power under which it could regulate prices for goods and services of all kinds . Last August the government obtained still more authority with such vague terms as " for generally insuring that the whole resources of the community are available for use and are used in a manner best calculated to serve the interests of the community . " Under these powers controls have multiplied like rabbits . Since the general election an estimated 6.500 new orders and regulations have been saddled on Britain 's economy by acts of Parliament , and many more have conic by administrative decree Most Britons  --  socialists and conservatives too -- agree that controls such as food . clothes and gas rationing are here to stay at least until shortages are overcome . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for more imports . Clothes will be rationed until production is high enough to meet both export targets and home requirements . Gasoline will be handed out in driblets until Britain can find dollars to buy more . Likewise prices on these and other necessities of life will be fixed until their abundance is achieved . What about the maze of other regulations which govern British Wet ' Some which fit into the pattern of a planned economy are enpected to be retained by the Labor government so long as it is in power . For instance , there 's little doubt that the increasingly complicated system of taxation  --  income . surtax , profits tax and the capital levy  --  will continue on its " soak the rich " basis . This fits into the Labor government policy of " fair shares for all ? ? ? Industry can expect less and less freedom from the planners Profits and dividends distributions will be limited by compulsion if voluntary efforts fail in the eyes of the government . The government is also expected to continue purchasing and distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British workers will he directed into industry so long as the manpower shortage persists British Burden The burden of many of these controls falls on the indicidual Englishman . To build a home he must submit to a complicated routine which requires permits . licences and approvals from a galaxy of agencies The building site must be approved by local authorities under the Town and Country Planning and the Restriction of Ribbon Development Acts . Plans must get the blessing of the Ministry of Health : the total cost of the ? ? ork plus the value of the land must not top a certain limit Building licenses must be obtsined . Applications must be filed with a variety of authorities in order to buy " controlledmaterials such as slate , lumber , iron or steel paint , plaster and fittings for electrical work Applications are even necessary to obtain gasoline to run concrete mixers . Imagine the frustration of home building Britons when one or more of these applications is either lost , neglected . or subiect to some other delay by officials dealing with them . This is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to mass political action as to individual evasion of the rules . For example , householders can only spend $40 on home repairs each year unless they get a license to do additional work . These are hard to come by . To avoid form filling and the possibility that the application may be rejected many simply pay their contractor the first $40 by check and the rest in cash . The contractor puts the check in his bank and the cash in his pocket British ingenuity has reached a new high in evasion of the Fuel Ministry 's cancellation of the basic gasoline ration . Motorists ca n't drive their own cars to their favorite greyhound race tracks or other amusement centers . But there is n't any ban which prevents their hiring a bus . Well-to-do Britons also resort to chauffeur-driven hired autos which also get enough gas to carry customers . Some drivers have turned their own autos into " hackney carriages " for hire to obtain gas for pleasure purposes . Many autoists who used to get along on their basic pleasure gas ration have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Necer have so many Britons had to travel so far by car on so much " essential " business . British courts have been doing a brisk business in cases of violations of such restrictions , for acts which would have been legal before the war . The newspapers are full of tales about unlucky folk who 've been meted out stiff fines . A big catering firm was fined $114,000 for " conspiring " to sell onions and for selling pears above the controlled price . A firm of contractors was fined $1 50ti tor building an office without a license . Hundreds of vacationists have been handed still n  --  es for cashing bank checks on the Continent  - -  violation of the foreign exchange controls which limit the amount of money Britons can take out of Britain
