A display of pocket knives arranged on a board in the center of a window . The light glistens and reflects from the opened blades . Over this scene we hear a merry voice singing , " Blow the Man Down . " &nbsp; VOICE ( o.s. , singing ) Come all ye young fellows who follow the sea . . . CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE BACK to show the display window of Rubin 's Seamen 's Outfitting Co . The display consists of cheap blue sweaters , stiff-looking civilian hats , watch caps , oilskins , and the other simple paraphernalia of a sailor 's life . In one corner is an enormously enlarged photo of Rubin himself , in his prime , fighting Joe Jeffries . Across the face of the window , in reflection , can be seen figures typical of a San Pedro street ; sailors , merchant jacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk seems to have the lilt of the song being sung . At the left-hand corner of the window can be seen the reflection of a Negro singer , a blind man , with a zither suspended from a strap around his neck . On the face of this instrument is a placard reading , " I am Blind . " A cup is suspended underneath it . As the CAMERA MOVES STILL FURTHER BACK , the actual figure of the blind beggar is disclosed . It is he whose merry voice is singing " Blow the Man Down . " &nbsp; BLIND BEGGAR ( singing ) It 's starboard and larboard we jump to the call When kicking Jack Roberts commands the Black Ball . Oh , give me some time to blow the man down . 2 CLOSEUP A man 's hand and arm come into the scene , and a coin spins from the hand and falls with the clink of silver into the blind man 's cup . &nbsp; TOM 'S VOICEFor luck .  --  3  --  &nbsp; BLIND BEGGAR ( breaking off his song ) Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need luck . 3-4 MED . SHOT Blind Beggar and Tom Merriam . Tom Merriam , a young man dressed in a very obviously new blue suit and carrying a new suitcase , is arrested by the last phrase , and turns to look again at the Beggar . The Beggar , almost sensing his movement of halting and looking , smiles . &nbsp; BLIND BEGGARAnd you 're a young sailor , too , sir . Do n't need eyes to tell me that . Young seamen all want luck when they 're outward bound . Only the old ones know there 's nothing but bad luck and bad blows at sea . Tom puts down his suitcase . The Beggar grins at him . &nbsp; BLIND BEGGAR ( cont 'd ) You 're an officer , too  --  &nbsp; TOMHow do you know ? &nbsp; BLIND BEGGARI heard your suitcase go down .

At the head of the gangway can be seen the hunched figure of a little man seated at the conjuncture of gangway rail and deck rail . This is the Finn . He is an odd , gnome-like little man , direct and quick of movement . He wears his watch cap in a peculiar fashion so that it has the appearance of a Phrygian bonnet , adding to the gnome-like quality of his appearance . As Tom ascends the gangway , the Finn looks up with bright , direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whetstone which he holds in his lap . 7 TWO SHOT Tom and Finn . Tom comes up to the head of the gangway . The Finn looks at him and continues sharpening his knife , not missing a stroke on the stone . &nbsp; TOMI 'm the Third Officer . Where can I find the Captain ?

Tom starts off . 8 CLOSE SHOT the Finn . He looks after Tom and , as he looks , his voice can be heard , in narration . &nbsp; FINN ( narration ) Another man I can not talk to  --  that I can never know and who can never know me  --  because I am a mute and can not speak .

Then he knocks a second time , and the door swings easily open . He goes in. 11 INT . CAPTAIN 'S OFFICE - NIGHT The desk , with neatly piled papers , is in the left b.g . A swivel chair is before the desk , an upholstered chair on the right . In back of the desk is a stair which leads up to the bridge . Books fill bookcases set alongside the bulkheads . Tom looks over the office , which is that of a man of unusually good taste , education and culture . A Hogarth print catches his eye . This is " The Gin Drinker , " a picture full of the cruelty and the madness sometimes so apparent in Hogarth 's works . Tom glances at the bookcase , and then looks closer . The books are beautifully bound and unusual , to say the least , in a freighter Captain 's quarters . Footsteps are heard from Tom 's left , as he stoops to look at the book titles . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending the staircase leading down from the bridge . This is the Captain of the Altair , a man of vigorous middle age , with a sailorly neatness in his dress and an air of quiet and competent authority .

We 'll get on , you and I. The boy smiles ; very pleased . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) I like a good ship , a clean ship , an obedient ship . As Third Officer , you have a certain authority .

The Captain catche hold of his sleeve , restraining him . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) Do n't . Tom turns to look at him . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) ( as if in explanation ) You have n't the right to kill that moth . Its safety does n't depend on you . No right  --  &nbsp; TOM ( interrupting ; puzzled ) I 'm sorry . I do n't understand . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( smiling ) Never mind . I 'll explain some time . We 've a long voyage ahead of us .

TOM 'S CABIN - NIGHT SHOOTING THROUGH the doorway , between the two men , the CAMERA SHOWS Tom 's cabin . The berth is unmade , blankets and sheets in great disorder . Tom turns to Raphael . &nbsp; TOMThe berth is n't made up . Raphael stands staring at the berth , as if perhaps he did not like to look at it , or as if the berth had some hidden significance . With his deadpan , which never relaxes into a smile just as it never contracts into a frown , he answers , smoothly and politely : &nbsp; RAPHAELSorry , sir . I have n't had a chance since Mr. Lingard died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the berth and then at Raphael . &nbsp; TOMHe died in this berth ? &nbsp; RAPHAELThat 's right , sir . He had such convulsions , he would have died on the floor if he had n't been held on the berth . Tom is silent . He goes into the room . The steward follows him . &nbsp; RAPHAEL ( cont 'd ) It seemed more proper for him to die there than on the floor , sir . &nbsp; TOM ( exclaiming , his voice subdued ) What was the matter with him ?  --  9  --  &nbsp; RAPHAELI do n't know , sir . But he did n't want to die . He was always telling funny stories . Tom shrugs . &nbsp; TOM ( points to the berth ) Well  - -  -  make it up . Can you change the blankets as well as the sheets ? Raphael nods . &nbsp; TOM ( cont 'd ) And open the porthole . As soon as we 're under way we 'll get some air in here . &nbsp; RAPHAELYes , sir .

BOATS AT FORECASTLE HATCH - NIGHT MED . SHOT . He leans down to peer into the forecastle . From below comes the sound of a strange melody being played on a bagpipe . &nbsp; BOATS ( bellowing ) On deck you guys ! The Captain wants a look at you . ( in a sing-song tone ) Rise and shine for the Dunham Line . I do n't mean one , I do n't mean two . I mean the whole sweet bellboy crew .

Boats looks up . 20 EXT . FORWARD END OF MAIN DECK - NIGHT The Captain , Tom and Mr. Bowns , the First Officer , are standing at the head of the ladder . Bowns , an ordinary-looking man , perhaps a little more serious than most , is dressed in a dingy serge uniform without either collar or tie . Tom has changed to his working clothes , dark trousers , dark sweater and an officer 's cap . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( to Tom ) You and Mr. Bowns had better have a look at the crew .  --  11  --  Bowns has already started for the ladder . &nbsp; BOWNS ( turning back to Tom ) Come on , Merriam .

In the silence that follows the echo of the mate 's shout , Tom reaches up and takes hold of the lamp just above his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . The pool of lamplight oscillates , extends in a long sweep , then comes swinging back . As the lamp itself comes swinging back to him , Tom grabs it and gives it another and a stronger heave .

The men , exclaiming in hushed tones , start forward . 22 EXT . WELL DECK - NIGHT The body of George Jennsen as the men gather around .

I heard one of the men putting it another way  --  I heard him say , " The ship comes to life at sea . " &nbsp; CAPTAINI suppose that 's the way all sailors feel . It 's good to go to sea for a sailor  --  and even better for an officer . They have reached the ladder , and the Captain pauses for a moment before beginning the descent . He breathes deeply . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) It 's a good feeling . In San Pedro I was just another captain  --  at sea , I am the Captain . He looks off for a moment and then begins climbing down the ladder . Tom follows . 28 AFTER WELL DECK - DAY MED . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coil down a large cable . &nbsp; LOUIEIt has to be coiled with the sun . It 's a law of the sea . &nbsp; JIMWhat difference does it make which way the rope is coiled , huh ? How can they have a law about it  --  there ai n't no cops .  --  17  --  Louie looks at him with an air which displays disgust , amusement and the most snobbish sort of superiority . &nbsp; LOUIEYou say you used to be a veterinary  --  is there two ways to milk a cow ? Jim shakes his head . &nbsp; LOUIE ( cont 'd ) Well , there 's only one way to coil a rope . It 's a law . &nbsp; JIMThat ai n't law . If you break a law , you get arrested . If you milk a cow the wrong way , she kicks . If you coil a rope the wrong way , it ca n't kick . I believe in logic . &nbsp; LOUIEAboard ship you 'd better believe in the Captain and forget logic .

This conversation has brought the two men as far as the ladder leading to the boat deck . At the foot of the boat deck , Billy and Peter are lashing the gangway to the rail . When the officers have passed them , Peter stops work and holds his hand to the right side of his abdomen . Bill looks up , grinning . &nbsp; BILLYYou sea sick ? &nbsp; PETERI 've never been sea sick  --  the Poppa rocked me in his arms when I was baptized .

I like the way he talks  --  the things he has to say . &nbsp; SPARKSI do n't know  --  I just stick to my job here . I do n't mix with the officers .

He looks at Tom and at the partially closed manhole . &nbsp; CAPTAINWhat 's wrong ? At the same time he asks the question , he opens the door and looks in . He peers in for a moment and then turns to Tom , leaving the door wide open as he does so . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) Better get a couple of men down here and get that cleaned up . &nbsp; TOM ( shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at him .  --  47  --  &nbsp; TOMBut he was a nice guy  --  always kidding  --  &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( musingly ) You 're impressed  --  death is so absolute . You looked into the chain locker  --  He makes a gesture with his hand . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd )  --  and no more Louie  --  no more insolent remarks  --  no more danger to the discipline of the ship . Tom stares at him for a long moment . &nbsp; TOMYou did n't like him . &nbsp; CAPTAINOf course I did n't like him . He was a sea lawyer  --  full of windy complaints , seasoned with bad comedy . &nbsp; TOMSo you shut the hatch . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( genuinely surprised ) Shut the hatch ? What do you mean , Mr. Merriam ? &nbsp; TOMThe hatch was shut  --  ( a little hesitantly , trying to remember )  --  and I think it was locked . &nbsp; CAPTAINAnd you accuse me of doing this out of spite because the man was insubordinate . &nbsp; TOM ( with a glance at the chain locker ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you had rights over the lives of the crew . You murdered him . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( controlling his anger ) You 're a little hasty , Mr. Merriam . &nbsp; TOM ( Heatedly ) You ca n't expect me to just stand by and watch you kill a man . A gleam of anger comes into the Captain 's eyes . His face hardens , but he still speaks softly . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( Sarcastic ) What do you propose to do ? Denounce me ? The two men stand facing each other . DISSOLVE 112 INT . CHART ROOM - NIGHT Tom enters the chart room , where Bowns , his back turned to Tom , is making an entry in the log . Tom hesitates . Bowns keeps writing slowly . &nbsp; TOMMay I speak to you a moment , Mr. Bowns  --  on a matter of great importance ? Bowns keeps on writing and does not turn around , but he replies . &nbsp; BOWNSWhat is it ? &nbsp; TOMWhat 's the law about an imcompetent Captain , Mr. Bowns ?

The Captain did it purposely . Bowns looks at Tom intently . &nbsp; BOWNSI do n't know what you 're trying to pull , fella , but my advice is to pull in your ears before you get into a jam you wo n't like . Now get away from me . I 'm busy . Bowns turns back to his work . &nbsp; TOMBut , Mr. Bowns , I 'm not joking . Bowns turns around again to face him . &nbsp; BOWNSYou heard me  --  and I 'm the First Officer . Tom nods and leaves . DISSOLVE 113 INT .

Sparks looks at Tom 's face . &nbsp; SPARKSWhat 's wrong , Kid ? &nbsp; TOM ( blurts ) The Captain 's crazy , Sparks . Sparks stares at Tom as soon as he begins to speak , and interrupts him at this point . &nbsp; SPARKSSure he 's crazy . Any guy who 'd ride one hobby horse so hard is bound to be bugs  --  and what a hobby to pick  --  authority .  --  50  --  &nbsp; TOM ( relieved ) Well , I 'm glad you believe me . Bowns practically threw me off the bridge . &nbsp; SPARKS ( lightly ) Sure , the Captain is a little teched . He puts back his earphones and starts his dancing step again . Tom is appalled . He grabs Sparks ' arm and stops him . Sparks reluctantly removes the earphones . &nbsp; TOMThis is n't a gag  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; SPARKSI know . Most people are . &nbsp; TOMBut he killed Louie . That was n't an accident in the chain locker .

I like my job and I want to keep it . &nbsp; TOMWhen we get to port , I 'm going to tell the company agent . Sparks shakes his head . &nbsp; SPARKSYou 'll lose a good job . Even if I believed you , I 'd advise you not to do it . &nbsp; TOMBut you ca n't mean that , Sparks . &nbsp; SPARKSI believe in keeping my nose clean  --  really clean  --  and out of other people 's business .

Jim , John , Aussman , Benson and the Finn are letting down the gangplank . Several men are waiting on the landing ; chief among them is a tall middle-aged American , Mr. Roberts , the agent for the Dunham Line . No sooner has the gangplank rattled into place than he starts up . 121 EXT . MAIN DECK - DAY Roberts comes up the gangway and is met on deck by Captain Stone .

He steps out into the full hard light of the street and looks around him at this strange new world . The street with its bleak , dull houses is uninteresting , but the people of the city passing along the streets and the road are new and colorful to Tom . He sees the ponchoed Indians with their hard hats , the squaws marching ahead of their menfolk , smoking red clay pipes . A small herd of sheep , tended by a shepherd mounted on an ass , goes baaing past . There is a strange combination of the modern and antiquated . A shiny automobile goes past a mule-drawn barouche . A truck and a wooden ox cart are parked side by side at the curb . Tom starts walking down the street looking into the shop windows , pausing to gaze after an attractive girl . He crosses the street , looks off and starts down another street . DISSOLVE 122A MR ROBERTS COMES WALKING AROUND THE SAME CORNER TOM HAD PASSED SOME TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AS TOM 123 EXT .

ROBERTS ' OFFICE - DAY Roberts comes in and finds Tom waiting for him . The clerk is fussing about , handing Tom an ashtray , etc . &nbsp; ELLENI 'm glad you accepted my invitation so promptly , Mr. Merriam . &nbsp; TOM ( getting to his feet ) Actually , I 'd like to have a few words with you , Mr. Roberts , on a matter of great importance .

To the Captain 's left , Tom is sitting , taut and nervous . At the left of the desk , in front of it , is sitting a male stenographer , bent over notes which he is making most laboriously .

Mr. Merriam has made certain statements and I called this informal hearing to prove to him how unfounded they were . I felt it was my duty as the company agent to prevent public investigation of a baseless charge . Thank you all for cooperating so splendidly  --  The men start to get up , shuffling and moving awkwardly . &nbsp; ELLEN ( cont 'd ) ( as they start filing out the door )  --  and have a good time . The men nod and grin in response as they are crowding out the door . When they have gone , leaving only Tom , the Captain and Mr. Roberts , the Captain slowly gets up and crosses over to Tom . &nbsp; CAPTAINI 'm sorry this had to happen , Tom .  --  57  --  Tom looks at him , then without a word , picks up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Roberts watch him as he leaves .

Roberts gives him a quick look as they start for the door . &nbsp; ELLENShe always watches for your ship . She 's down there now , waiting for you . She 's got good news . 126 EXT . STREET SAN SEBASTIAN - DAY The two men , Roberts and the Captain , come out of the office and walk up the street . They are deep in conversation and pause occasionally to talk more easily . The CAMERA DOLLIES WITH them , pausing as they pause . At the end of the collonade , they stop beside Robert 's car . &nbsp; CAPTAINCharlie , I think it might be a good idea if you would take the lad off the Altair and get me another third officer . Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is n't like you . I 've never known you to hold grudges . &nbsp; CAPTAINIt 's not a grudge . I like the boy . I see so much of myself in him .

He seems a fine honest chap . &nbsp; CAPTAINI do n't want him on my ship .  --  58  --  Roberts looks inquiringly at the Captain . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) I like him too well to hurt him . &nbsp; ELLENThat 's a strange remark , Will . &nbsp; CAPTAINI 've not been myself lately . My nerves are on edge . I lose my temper . Things are n't right with me . I do n't sleep . There 's a ringing in my ears . Something 's wrong . &nbsp; ELLEN ( laughing ) You 've worked too hard too long , Will . When you get back to the States , have a thorough medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rest . &nbsp; CAPTAINIt is n't my metabolism I 'm worried about -- -it 's my mind .

I 've been badly worried about it , Charlie . My mind is what I take pride in -- - what I most treasure . &nbsp; ELLENYour mind 's all right . You just see a good doctor as I said . Meanwhile , I 'll remove young Merriam and get you a good man to take his place . All you need are some new interests . They have reached his car and he turns aside to open the car door .

He wears a jersey on which is written S.S.Kronprinz Wil --  ; the rest of the name can not be distinguished . On his knee sits a pretty brunette girl in a fanciful national costume . The sailor is trying to kiss her and she is demurely attempting to avoid his caress . Over the scene we hear a weakly protesting male voice . &nbsp; JOE SNITZPlease , mister , hold the pose  --  just the pose , please . The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the fact that the sailor and the girl are merely subjects for a street photographer . He has his camera set up , and by the tripod stand various boxes and pieces of equipment . One of the boxes has printed on it in large letters the following words : &nbsp; PARISIENNE PHOTOGRAPHERPhotos with Native Model  --  10 pesos Joe Snitz  --  Paris , Ill . While the sailor continues his playful efforts to kiss the girl , the CAMERA PULLS STILL FURTHER BACK to reveal Jim , John , Aussman and Benson standing in a semicircle watching the photographer and his two subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the girl 's lips . The photographer comes out from under his black cloth and advances protestingly . &nbsp; JOE SNITZ ( cont 'd ) Mister , you ca n't do that  --  she 's my wife . The crew from the Altair laughs uproriously when the German sailor gives Snitz a playful shove that sends him sprawling . The girl tries to break away from the sailor . &nbsp; GIRL ( in a tough voice that has oft been used to cheer the Dodgers ) You let me go . Ai n't you got no sense of decency ? Let me go . John suddenly grins . &nbsp; JOHNSay , that girl 's from Brooklyn  --  that 's my home town . He steps forward and pulls her away from the German .  --  60  --  &nbsp; JOHN ( cont 'd ) You leave her alone . The German makes a pass at him and misses , and John lets him have one in the breadbasket . The German doubled up in pain , but the blow seems to have loosed a hornet 's nest . The door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German 's fellow crew members come flooding out of the Cantina . &nbsp; JIMCheese it . ( almost simultaneously ) &nbsp; JOHNToo many of them . Get going . The Altair men take to their heels , pursued down the street by the German seamen . 128 THE PIER - DAY The Altair can be seen framed in the arches of the pier structure . The CAMERA IS SHOOTING PAST the outlined figure of a woman who stands watching the gangway . This is Ellen Roberts , a lovely woman , smartly yet appropriate dressed in a simple suit . She has an air of aloof charm and casual elegance that would distinguish her in any company .  --  61  --  &nbsp; ELLENThat sounds serious . While I 'm waiting , why do n't you let me give you a lift ? You could tell me all about it . &nbsp; TOMNo . Thank you . &nbsp; ELLENThose bags 'll get awfully heavy before you get to the hotel .

The whole world seems to have turned against you  --  just because you made a mistake . &nbsp; TOM ( bitterly ) I did n't make a mistake . Ellen smiles . &nbsp; ELLENIt 's almost the Captain 's voice , Tom . I did n't make a mistake  --  I could n't make a mistake  --  I 'm authority  --  I 'm the Third Officer  --  I 'm the Captain . ( pauses ) I 've heard it all so often and it 's all so wrong .  --  62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what the Captain thinks . &nbsp; ELLENExactly ! You 're just like the Captain . Lonely , austere , bitter  --  without friends or family , condemning yourself to the heights  --  heights which you call authority . &nbsp; TOMI do n't know any other way of life . &nbsp; ELLEN ( gently ) How long do you think I 've known the Captain , Tom ? Tom shakes his head . &nbsp; ELLEN ( cont 'd ) I 've known him fifteen years . For fifteen years I 've tried to give him love instead of loneliness  --  but always that austerity  --  that singleness of purpose . He has become a changed man and an unhappy man , and all the while I was helpless . I could n't do anything about it . You must n't be like him . You 've got to embrace warmth and life  --  a good joke  --  a pretty girl . &nbsp; TOMI do n't know any girls . &nbsp; ELLEN ( smiling ) That 's clear enough . But you will . I have a younger sister in San Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'll meet you on your next trip north . I 'll see to that . If you do n't like her , she will introduce you to other girls and other young men  --  young men who do n't even know what the word authority means .

His hands hang down listlessly between his knees and he is gazing off into the darkness . 133 EXT . FORWARD PORTION OF THE MAIN DECK - NIGHT Ellen stands near the rail , looking forward , the wind lightly blowing her hair . Behind her in the darkness of the alleyway , the Captain stands leaning against the deckhouse , smoking a cigar and watching her . &nbsp; ELLEN ( quietly ) I have something to tell you , Will . &nbsp; CAPTAINThat 's what Charlie said . &nbsp; ELLENI wanted to be here  --  aboard the Altair  --  when I told you .  --  64  --  She turns to him , smiling . &nbsp; ELLEN ( cont 'd ) I want my rival to hear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; CAPTAINI 've always loved your fancies , Ellen . &nbsp; ELLENThis is n't a fancy . I want the old Altair to know I 'm a free woman  --  that I can take you from her , and keep you from her . &nbsp; CAPTAINYou won your case ? &nbsp; ELLENHe finally gave in . The final papers came through last week . I 'm a free woman . She turns to him . He takes a draft on the cigar , inhaling the smoke and blowing it out again as if solely engrossed in this habitual act . She watches him in expectant silence . It is a silence he does not break . &nbsp; ELLEN ( cont 'd ) ( disappointedly ) I had expected a different response , Will . The Captain still remains silent and again draws on the cigar . &nbsp; ELLEN ( cont 'd ) I thought we were both waiting for this . The Captain moves uneasily , then speaks precisely choosing his words and avoiding her eyes , holding his cigar between them almost as a barrier . &nbsp; CAPTAINI had waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do or say . ( almost whispering ) I 'm afraid .  --  65  --  &nbsp; ELLEN ( with a laugh , half hysteria and half forced amusement ) Afraid of me , Will ? &nbsp; CAPTAINOf my mind , Ellen . I do n't trust it any more . &nbsp; ELLEN ( with quick anxiety , stepping forward ) Your mind ? &nbsp; CAPTAINDo n't come close to me . Stand there . &nbsp; ELLENBut , Will  --  &nbsp; CAPTAINI remember Captain Blaker of the Ajax  --  she was my first ship  --  I was the mess boy . I watched him lose his mind  --  little by little  --  and he knew it and could do nothing about it . It was awful , Ellen . I 've never forgotten it . He takes another drag from the cigar and speaks more calmly . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) We were run down in a fog off the coast of the Mersey . The Ajax sank like a rock . Blaker went down with her . He was lucky . Ellen takes the step forward that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes one of his hands between her palms . &nbsp; ELLENIt 's only a memory that frightens you . The Captain shakes his head .  --  66  --  &nbsp; CAPTAINIt 's more than that , Ellen . I 've felt strange . I 've done things I could n't remember doing . I 've had moments when I 've felt myself on the verge of losing control  --  of doing terrible , stupid , ugly things . This morning when the boy testified against me , I could barely keep my seat  --  He lapses into silence as if the memory of his thoughts were too awful to mention . They stand looking at each other . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) Give me a little time to get over this  --  this feeling that I do n't know myself  --  that I do n't control my thoughts  --  my actions . &nbsp; ELLEN ( very softly ) You can have all the time in the world . ( forcing a smile ) I 'll be waiting here for the Altair on her next voyage . DISSOLVE OUT DISSOLVE IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German sailors off the Cecilie Herzogin are milling about the door of the Cantina . Somehow they have caught and made a captive of Billy . They have the little colored man backed up against the wall . The leader of the gang is evidently trying to force him to sing . &nbsp; GERMAN SAILOR ( translate to German ) Go ahead and sing , or we 'll break your neck . &nbsp; BILLYI 'm a British subject , I am , and I 'll not sing for you or any other Heinie . The German sailor shoves him roughly against the wall . Billy hits at him , ineffectually , and is given a harder shove for his pains . It is at this moment that Tom , neatly dressed in his shore clothes , comes out of the Cantina , evidently on his way to keep his appointment with Ellen . &nbsp; BILLY ( cont 'd ) Mr. Merriam ! Tom stops in the doorway . &nbsp; TOMWhat are you men up to ? What goes on here ? He steps forward , obviously intent on intervening . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chin and knocks him down . From behind him , as Tom turns to deal with another man , a third sailor hits him over the head with a club . He goes down . Billy , who has been trying to get to Tom 's side to help him , is shoved roughly aside , falls sprawling . The German sailors take to their heels . Billy gets unsteadily to his feet , goes over to Tom , kneels down beside him and tries to take care of him . A few people have been attracted by the altercation and have formed a ring around the fallen man . &nbsp; BILLY ( supporting Tom 's head ) You all right , Mr. Merriam ? Tom makes no answer . One of the bystanders , a kindly man , kneels down beside Tom .  --  68  --  &nbsp; BILLY ( to the man ) This man here is my officer from the Altair . He 's been hurt . I got to get him back aboard .

Gray dawn is coming dimly through the porthole over his bed . Gradually he realizes that he is back aboard the Altair , in his old cabin . He sits up suddenly in bed . The movement causes him to put his hand to his head , which is aching . He groans as he looks around the familiar room . He gets up slowly , in his pyjamas , and goes to the wash basin , which might be of the collapsible variety , draws and drinks a glass of water . He moves to a full-length mirror and examines his reflection . As he stands in front of this mirror , he is making up his mind what to do . He suddenly comes to a decision , goes to his closet , opens it , and takes out a suit of clothes . He starts to unbutton his pyjama jacket . DISSOLVE 137 INT . CAPTAIN 'S CABIN - DAY The Captain is breakfasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inimitable neatness , precisely bringing each forkful to his mouth , taking exactly two sips from the coffee cup each time he brings it to his lips . There is something deadly and menacing in this over-dainty feeding . Tom , who has quite evidently just entered , stands before him . &nbsp; TOM --  and so I thought I 'd best report to you at once . The Captain takes a forkful of ham , chews , swallows , and lifts the coffee cup to his lips . &nbsp; TOM ( cont 'd ) Naturally , had I had anything to say about it , I would n't be here . Evidently Billy had the policeman bring me abroad .  --  69  --  The Captain carefully spears another forkful of ham and brings it to his mouth , his eyes still on Tom 's face .

You ca n't expect me to swim -- - &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( interrupting ) That 's quite the wrong tone , Merriam . I was just about to say that you would be my guest on the trip North . You 'll have no duties . We 'll try to make it as pleasant a voyage as possible . &nbsp; TOMThank you . The Captain waves his thanks away with a gesture of his hand . &nbsp; CAPTAINIn fact , Merriam , I 'm rather glad to have you aboard . There are some theories of mine I 'd like to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interesting and instructive voyage . There are many things you can learn from me . &nbsp; TOM ( just for politeness sake , but somewhat alarmed ) I 've never doubted that , sir . &nbsp; CAPTAINI 'm sure you never doubted it when you told Mr. Roberts I was a murderer and incompetent .  --  70  --  Tom is about to say something . The Captain silences him with a gesture . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) But we 'll forget all that , Mr. Merriam . &nbsp; TOM ( slowly and a little dubiously ) Thank you , Captain . He turns to go . At the door , the Captain 's voice stops him . &nbsp; CAPTAINMr . Merriam . You know , there are some Captains who would hold this against you . He smiles . Tom goes out . 138 EXT . BOAT DECK - DAY Tom has just closed the door of the Captain 's office . The ship 's horn sounds , a mournful note . The sound of the radio comes from Sparks ' office . Tom listens to this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears from the opposite direction . &nbsp; TOMI was wondering if you got me to bed last night . I do n't remember -- - Raphael does not even stop , but looks Tom in the eyes and passes him along the corridor . Tom turns and looks after Raphael . He hesitates , then steps to the radio room . 139 TOM STANDING IN DOORWAY TO THE RADIO ROOM Sparks is sitting at the radio . Sparks looks up as - &nbsp; TOMHi , Sparks . I seem to have gotten myself --  --  &nbsp; SPARKS ( grinning ) Do n't come in here , fella . I do n't want to get mixed up in any funny business with you .

I can see it in his face . Sparks makes a gesture of deep and significant disgust . &nbsp; TOM ( cont 'd ) I 'm not too dumb a guy , Sparks , I 'm not yellow -- -I 'm not hysterical -- -and I 'm telling you he 's going to kill me and I need your help . &nbsp; SPARKS ( with finality ) That is hogwash . &nbsp; TOM ( after a little pause ) At least , do me one favor -- - send a wireless to Miss Roberts in San Sebastian . Sparks , shaking his head , seats himself , turning his back to Tom . He busies himself with his apparatus . &nbsp; SPARKSI ca n't do that . The Captain 's forbidden all wireless -- - unless he personally okays it . &nbsp; TOMDo n't you see ? That 's part of what I meant . &nbsp; SPARKS ( with profound disbelief ) Yeah ?

Tom examines the door . The lock has been removed . It is impossible for him to make the door stay closed . He looks around the cabin for some article with which he can fasten the door . His chair is fastened to the floor . Nothing movable is available . He takes a letter , or a piece of paper , from his pocket , folds it , and inserts it between the door and the jamb . He stands looking unhappily at this flimsy device . He removes his jacket , and footsteps , slow and methodical sound in the corridor . He pauses , with his jacket still in his hands , listening . The slow footsteps grow louder as they approach his door , behind which he is standing . The footsteps stop outside the door , and there is a silence as Tom stands , breathlessly , waiting and listening . Then the footsteps begin again , this time continuing down the corridor in diminuendo . As they die away , Tom quickly tosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and looks down the corridor . 142 SHOT OF A SHADOW MOVING ON THE WALL DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND VANISHING AS TOM LOOKS There is silence . 143 SHOT OF TOM AS HE MOVES BACK INTO THE CABIN AGAIN fastens the door with the paper and , without undressing further and leaving his lights burning , lies down in trousers and shirtsleeves on his bed , watching the door . 144 INT .

He is fighting sleep . He half sits , half lies on the bed , watching the door . The lights in the room suddenly flicker and go out . A faint moonlight comes in through the porthole . As quickly as possible , Tom arises and moves across the cabin , and stands against the wall of the door , waiting and listening . 145 TOM - STILL STANDING BESIDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door panel , he moves back to the bed . His head nods . He hears the paper he has placed beneath the door scrape . He starts up . A flashlight blinds him . Tom is staring into the flashlight , blinded by the sudden brilliance .

The Captain 's orders . Raphael goes to the light socket , unscrews the old bulb and inserts a new one . The light comes on . &nbsp; TOMWhat made the lights go out ? &nbsp; RAPHAELI do n't know , sir , but I think there is a short or something here . The Captain hopes you enjoy your tea , sir . He told me to say that he wo n't forget you . During and after this speech , Raphael stares at Tom , and then his eyes go to the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cont 'd ) Pleasant dreams , sir . Raphael goes out the door , which swings a jar . 146 TOM - STANDING BY HIS DESK - LOOKING AT THE DOOR - THEN AT THE TEAPOT He lifts the teapot and holds it in pouring position over the teacup . But he does not pour any tea . Instead , he stands staring at the pot . He moves to the wash basin , and empties the tea into the basin . His eyes go around the cabin , and focus on the porthole . He goes to the porthole , which is over the bed , kneels on the bed , and looks out . Tom sits down again on the bed , looking at the door . DISSOLVE pp. 37-54 &nbsp; pp. 74-93 147 EXT .

He looks out into the corridor , protruding his head , comes back and lies down on the bed . He dozes , suddenly awakens with a start and jumps to his feet , and listens . Eight bells sounding in various parts of the ship , as previously described , come over the sound track . Tom goes to and tests the door again . He stands motionless , looking around his cabin . He looks at his desk lamp , looks at a pipe overhead . He goes to the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet . He tears a strip lengthwise from the sheet .  --  75  --  153 EXT .

He draws the other end over the pipe which runs across the ceiling . He attaches the free end to the chain which lights the lamp bulb , and sets the lamp on the floor , raising the shade so that the lamp will shine on the door . He tests his device first by drawing on the sheet . The lamp lights and illuminates the door . He extinguishes the lamp , and goes to the door and opens it . The lamp shines brightly on the opened doorway . He closes the door again , replaces the paper stopper , and lies down , still dressed . At this moment , there is a crash in the cabin , and Tom leaps to his feet , looking around in the dim light from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . He sees either that the collapsible washstand has fallen , or that a carafe of water , or a bottle has crashed into the wash bowl , due to the roll of the ship .

Tom wheels around . Tom faces the Captain at a distance of about eight feet . The Captain holds a revolver in his right hand . They stand motionless for a second or two . Tom tenses as if to charge the Captain , who raises the revolver and points it at Tom 's abdomen . &nbsp; CAPTAINHold it . Tom stands tensed facing the Captain . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( cont 'd ) ( softly , but grimly ) One move , and you 'll have a bullet through your abdomen  --  not a pleasant or a quick death .

The Captain thinks this over a moment , and his face becomes set and strained . &nbsp; CAPTAINI never felt more sane in my life than I feel at this moment . Who is crazy  --  you who defied me and are helpless and discredited , or I who control your destiny and the destiny of the Altair and all the lives on board ? &nbsp; TOMI wish Bowns , I wish the crew could see what I see now  --  could hear you talk .  --  78  --  &nbsp; CAPTAINYou think I 'm insane ? &nbsp; TOMYes .

That 's what I want you to learn  --  men are worthless cattle  --  and a few men are given authority to drive them . &nbsp; TOMYou wo n't even be able to prove that to me with a gun , Captain . I know people are n't that way  --  they 're usually good and kind  --  willing to help other people . It 's only hard to get them to understand . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( laughing ) I 'm going to give you a chance to make them understand . You can go out of here  --  you can go anywhere you want on the ship  --  you can talk to anyone  --  and see who 'll help you  --  who 'll dare to stand up with you against authority .

Jim keeps on polishing the bell , apparently oblivious to Tom . &nbsp; TOM ( cont 'd ) How do you think your pal was caught in the chain locker ? Do you think that hatch cover closed itself ? Jim moistens his rag from a can of polish and without looking up . &nbsp; JIMIf you 'll take my advice , you 'll stop trying to make trouble around here .

The two boys stand looking at each other a moment without a word . Sparks hands over a wireless blank . Tom turns it toward the lamp to read it , then faces about and looks at Sparks . &nbsp; TOMI do n't get this . ( reading ) " Tom Merriam not aboard Altair . Regards . " ( turning back to Sparks ) Why in the world would the Captain want to send this to Mr. Roberts . &nbsp; SPARKSIt 's just because I do n't know that I 'm beginning to believe your story , Tom . Tom studies the wireless form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ) This was sent in reply to a message from Roberts asking if you were aboard .

The Finn watches until the two men have disappeared in the gloom aft , then steps forward . He bends down and awkwardly , examining the whole rather than any particular , in the manner of one who does not know how to read . INSERT THE WIRELESS BLANK . It reads : CHARLES S.

Tom swings his legs out of the bed and sits on the edge of the berth . He is dressed in plain white pyjamas . He gropes on the deck for his straw slippers and shoves his feet into them . By this time enough sleep has cleared from his brain to allow him to think and question . &nbsp; TOMI beg your pardon , sir , but why ca n't Sparks send it ? &nbsp; CAPTAINThe message I 'm asking you to send will answer that question .

Bowns nods and takes the hypodermic needle out of the kit . The Captain watches him do this , then turns and leaves the cabin . Bowns , with the needle in hand , bends down and starts to bare Tom 's arm . Tom twists and turns and tries vainly to speak with his eyes to beg Bowns to wait - to give him a chance . Bowns methodically rolls up Tom 's pajama sleeve , dabs on alcohol and gives the injection . ( The actual act of giving the hypodermic should be masked from the camera . ) Almost immediately , Tom 's lids grow heavy ; his eyes grow dull .

In the polished surface of the wood his face can be seen " as in a glass , darkly . " On the sound track Bown 's voice can still be heard , repeating " The boy is right .

The Greek is playing his bagpipe and Billy is dancing and singing to the music .  --  91  --  197 INT . TOM 'S CABIN - NIGHT The room is lit only by the faint light coming through the portholes and the movement of the boat causes these shafts of light to move about the room . In this dim light can be distinguished the dark figure of the Captain as he stands over Tom 's bunk . 198 THE CAPTAIN FROM TOM 'S ANGLE He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . 199 CLOSE SHOT OF TOM He is still struggling against the effects of the drug . He keeps his eyes open only by an effort of will . They are heavy lidded and strained as he gazes upward . 200 CLOSE SHOT OF THE CAPTAIN Suddenly in the immobility of his face there is a flicker of movement ; a flash of purpose in his eyes . He is about to strike . 201 MED CLOSE SHOT the door as it suddenly swings open revealing the Finn who is pulling his shiv from its sheath . 202 MED . SHOT the Captain as he whirls to meet the Finn . He sees the deadly purpose in the Finn 's crouch , and he half turns in the hope of stabbing Tom before having to fight this new antagonist . The Finn moves in quickly . He stabs at the Captain , knocking him off balance so that he goes reeling across the room , crashing into the washstand , which splinters with his weight . The Finn leaps at him , but before he can engage , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Finn 's blow with a parry of his knife . The two blades shrill with the sound of steel on steel . The two men fight in deadly silence , stabbing and hacking at each other about the room , first one and then another falling and then regaining his feet and then coming back to fight once more . Blood drips from them and in the close confines of the pitching cabin , they pant and gasp for breath . All the while above them is the faint sound of the bagpipe and the merry slap of Billy 's dancing feet . The Captain forces the Finn into a corner and moves his knife into position for the kill . The Finn grasps the blade in his naked hand . The Captain twists the knife and pulls it from his clutch , but even this moment of pain has given the Finn respite enough to leap away , gather himself and charge again . Again the Captain fights him off , and now the Captain 's superior bulk and strength comes to his aid . The Finn ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knife wrist in his hand , and the Captain , parrying a low thrust from the Finn , grabs the Finn 's wrist with his left hand . The Captain pushes with all his strength against the Finn 's wounded hand , and little by little the fingers give way , the knife going down closer and closer to the Finn 's heart . The Finn pushes with all his might against the Captain 's restraining hand and can not move his knife forward a single inch , then suddenly he brings his knee up and kicks the knife blade home into the Captain 's groin . The Captain falls . The Finn stands over him and from the mute 's throat comes a horrible sound , a dumb man 's crow of triumph . 203 CLOSE SHOT OF TOM He gives up the fight against the drug and falls asleep . DISSOLVE 204 INT . BRIDGE - NIGHT Tom is on the bridge . The Finn is at the wheel beside him . The light from the binnacle is glowing . The chronometer in front of the Finn rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which rings the bridge bell , four times . From forward comes the answering four strokes of the big bell on the forecastle , and the lookout 's voice : &nbsp; LOOKOUTLights are burning bright . DISSOLVE 205 SIDE OF THE PIER AT SAN PEDRO - DAY Tom comes down the gangplank , bag in hand . At the foot of the gangplank stands the blind beggar playing his zither and still singing : &nbsp; BLIND BEGGAR " Oh give me some time to blow the man down . " Tom pauses , puts down his bag and fishes in his pocket for a coin . He drops it into the man 's tin cup . &nbsp; TOMFor luck . &nbsp; BLIND BEGGARThank you , sir . Being a sailor you 'll need luck . Tom stands grinning at him .  --  93  --  &nbsp; BLIND BEGGAROh , you 're a sailor all right , sir . I do n't need eyes to tell me you 're a seaman outward bound . Tom merely grins and starts to pass on toward the left . From the right a young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Merriam  --  Mr. Merriam ! Tom turns inquiringly to his right . On the ship 's side tho shadow of a fashionable young girl can be seen . He smiles and begins to step toward her . &nbsp; GIRL 'S VOICE ( cont 'd ) Mr. Merriam , my sister , Ellen , told me to meet your ship . Tom steps out of frame . The old beggar feels in the cup for the coin Tom had flung him . On the ship 's side the shadow of Tom and the girl can be seen extending their hands to each other .
