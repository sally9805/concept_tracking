Down the street we see Paul pull into the curb and stop his bicycle as a girl , Julie , runs out of the door of a house . She turns and waves to Louise who waves back . 73 EXT .

STREET - DAY MED.CLOSE SHOT - Louise and Albert watching them . But Louise is hardly seeing them , worrying about her brother 's behaviour , and Albert does n't see them at all , worrying about that paper he hid in his bedroom . CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD of them as they walk on toward school . &nbsp; LOUISE ( looking straight ahead ) It worries me  --  the way he 's making friends with these  --  ( her tone is full of contempt )  --  these soldiers . &nbsp; ALBERT ( looking straight ahead , anxiously - not making any sense ) I 'll just say I did n't know anything about it . &nbsp; LOUISE ( not hearing , looking straight ahead , very worried ) He never was afraid of anything  --  and I know he 's honest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROF . SOREL IN SCHOOL - DAY FULL SHOT . Prof. Sorel , a fine-looking man of seventy , with a look of elegance about him in spite of his baggy , loose-fitting clothes , is feeding his canaries in a cage that hangs beside the window which overlooks the school yard , while Mayor Manville is very busy behind him , taking school books from shelves along the wall and piling them on a table , checking from a list which he has in his hand . ( A large print , a primitive Pieta , on wall over fireplace ) 76 CLOSE SHOT - Sorel as he turns from the birds and looks out the window , his hands in his baggy pockets , staring out thoughtfully . His manner disapproves what the Mayor is doing but he is holding his tongue . Through the window past him we see children straggling across the courtyard toward the school , carrying satchels , some of them romping and playing , others walking more slowly . Sorel absently changes his glasses ( it is a habit he has ) removing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and putting them on so he can watch the children . Albert and Louise enter the yard gate and come toward school . 77 CLOSE SHOT - Mayor at table with Sorel in b.g. , his back to us . The mayor has finished his list and now he pushes the books into a stack as he turns to Sorel . &nbsp; MAYORThese must be burned , Professor Sorel. 78 CLOSE SHOT - Sorel as he turns around into camera , quietly . &nbsp; SORELBy your order , Mr. Mayor , or by order of the enemy ? 79 TWO SHOT - as the mayor looks pained , raising a hand of protest . &nbsp; MAYORNot by my order , my dear Sorel . Look , I 'm here because I 'm your friend . We 've known each other all our lives . Perhaps we held different ideas , but I respect you . It 's not my job , and not my wish , to do this  --  ( cont 'd )  --  27  --  &nbsp; MAYOR ( cont 'd ) ( indicates books ) - but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It 's our duty to preserve the life of this town , and the only way is to collaborate with the occupying authorities . &nbsp; SOREL ( indicates condemned books ) By burning truth ? &nbsp; MAYOR ( very friendly ) My dear old friend , what does it matter in a time of crisis - a little more or less truth ? Perhaps the untruth was in our past . We 've always taught in our schools that the important history of our country began with the revolution . We were obsessed with individual freedom and the Rights of Man . We forgot the necessity of Authority and obedience  --  and so lost discipline . Without discipline we had strikes and political disorders . People did not agree . Look how our young people behaved - flouting their parents , thinking only of pleasure , parties , girls . Young men wanted cars . In our time we had no cars , my dear Sorel . &nbsp; SOREL ( dryly ) Maybe the reason was that there were no cars . &nbsp; MAYOR ( stiffening ) You must agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean by discipline that we should become servants of the enemy and help them to conquer other free peoples ?  --  28  --  &nbsp; MAYOR ( righteously ) You 're not showing much understanding of the nature of this national ordeal . Perhaps God ordained it to teach us how to live . We suffer , yes  --  but maybe it is for our own good . We must get back to family , duty , hard work , obedience  --  ( with a touch of coldness ) And about " the enemy " as you said , do n't forget we are Europeans , not Anglo-Saxons and God 's will may be to unite all Europe . &nbsp; SORELWith bayonets ? The Mayor does n't reply but looks at him as if he deplored such a stubborn attitude . He bends over and looks at half a dozen worn volumes between book ends on Sorel 's desk . &nbsp; SOREL ( cont 'd ) ( before the Mayor can question them ) Those are my personal books . &nbsp; MAYOR ( inspecting titles , murmurs ) Juvenal . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Republic " . . . ( looks at Sorel curiously ) My dear friend , we have to be careful about that word " republic . " Sorel looks out the window for a moment , his hands calmly folded behind his back . Then he turns very quietly to the Mayor who feeling an unpleasant tension , picks up his hat to leave . &nbsp; SORELWould you like to have my resignation ?  --  29  --  &nbsp; MAYOR ( at door , warmly ) By no means , by no means , my dear Sorel ! We need you . You have the respect of the whole community . I only want you for your own good to understand our problems a little more clearly . The hall door opens and we glimpse Albert and Louise . Albert is a little confused to find so important a person as the Mayor confronting him and he bows and stammers . &nbsp; ALBERTOh , excuse me , Mr. Mayor - we were told that Prof. Sorel - well , sir , I 'm awfully sorry to intrude  --  &nbsp; MAYOR ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lory . I 'm just leaving . Good morning , Miss Martin . He goes out past them and Albert follows Louise into the room , still a bit off balance at confronting important authority . He bows to Sorel . Louise , who is devoted to old Sorel , looks at his face and sees something unpleasant has occurred . Sorel goes to his desk rather wearily . &nbsp; LOUISE ( with quick sympethy ) Is anything wrong ? &nbsp; SOREL ( quietly ) Yes , Louise . Come here , please . Come here , Mr. Lory . The three of them go to his desk and he opens a marked schoolbook on the desk top . 80 CLOSE THREE SHOT - their heads bent over the book , the young girl , the middle-aged timid man and the strong-hearted old man . There is a sad smile on Sorel 's face as he leafs open the book and puts his finger on a page which is marked for deletion.  --  30  --  &nbsp; SORELIt 's a very delicate surgical operation - to cut out the heart without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very tough old patient , and we 'll do the best we can . ( his finger moves on the book ) We start here , with Charlemagne . . . Section Details 81 INT . SCHOOL - ALBERT 'S CLASSROOM - DAY There are about thirty-five desks in the room , which fronts on the street , but only about twenty boys aged ten to fourteen . One of the boys is Edmond Lorraine , who lives across the street from Lory above the department store . Edmond alone is sitting at his desk , studying , while the others are playing games , talking , stirring about noisily and , above all , watching the two oldest and most obstreperous boys , Julian Lamont and Henry Noble . Julian is drawing a caricature of Albert hugging and kissing Louise while Henry sets the hall door ajar , climbs on a stool and sets a box of chalk stop it so that when the door is pushed open the box will fell . A small boy , something of a clown , is behind Albert 's desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of the pupils who are laughing . In the middle of their pranks the boy who is watching at the crook of the door makes a signal and they all fly to their desks. 82 INT . SCHOOL - HALLWAY BETWEEN CLASSROOMS - DAY From the further door of Sorel 's office we see Albert and Louise come out with marked books under their arms , and we see Sorel close the door behind them . They come toward camera to door of Louise 's classroom . Louise is full of sympathy for Sorel and indignant at what has been done to him . Before opening her door , while Albert looks at her with bashful love in his timid eyes , she turns to Albert , her voice low and indignant . &nbsp; LOUISEWhy do they make us do this - this dirty work ? Why do n't they put in German teachers and be done with it ? &nbsp; ALBERT ( trying in a blundering way to comfort her ) Do n't - do n't be upset , Louise . It 's only a few pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very feminine and impatient with his clumsy blindness and lack of backbone . &nbsp; LOUISEOh - Albert ! And she opens the door and goes into her class . We glimpse some of the little girls before the door closes sharply behind her in Albert 's stricken face . He makes a vague gesture as if to follow her and then takes his hand quickly from the doorknob , and somewhat confused and vague turns to his own door at the opposite side of the narrow hall . But before the door he realizes where he is , and we suddenly realize by the effort he makes to gather himself together that it is always an ordeal for him to enter and face his boys . With exaggerated firmness he grasps the doorknob and tries to stride in commandingly , like a man who tenses his muscles before diving into cold water . The box of chalk falls with a crash in front of him , he jumps and spills the books under his arm , then stops rigidly while there is a guffew of laughter which dwindles out into giggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INT . SCHOOL - ALBERT 'S CLASSROOM - DAY As Albert stoops to retrieve his spilled books , Edmond Lorraine springs forward to help him . Albert , with an effort at dignity , goes to his desk , and as Edmond goes back to his desk a larger boy sticks out a foot and trips him . Albert turns with a nervous jerk as the boy crashes , but Edmond quickly gets to his feet and slides into his desk without complaint . Albert is just about to put his books on his own desk when the blackboard catches his eye . 84 CLOSE SHOT - caricature on blackboard - Albert hugging and kissing Louise and written crudely under it : " Teacher loves Teacher . " 85 CLOSE SHOT - Albert , as he looks at it with helpless horror , and we hear a repressed giggling from the boys . 86 FULL SHOT . Albert , with the last vestiges of his dignity , quietly erases the caricature , but his hand trembles so that he finally drops the eraser . Another giggle and he does n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk .  --  32  --  &nbsp; ALBERTUntil our new schoolbooks are supplied to us , we are going to make a few  --  corrections .

( opens his book ) Page 7 . He tears it out , and we hear the ripping of twenty other pages as the boys obey simultaneously . 87 CLOSE SHOT - Albert , as he turns to more pages . ( The blackboard with the half-erased caricature behind him , we do n't see the pupils . ) &nbsp; ALBERTPages 15 , 16 and 17 . He tears them out together , and we hear the simultaneous ripping of the twenty boys with their books . 88 INT .

SCHOOL - HALL BETWEEN CLASSROOMS - DAY We see Louise at her door as the girls file out quietly and orderly . Albert Lory stands by the opposite door of his own classroom from which his boys are piling out pell-mell , noisily and disorderly . The children are going down the stair at end of hall which leads to the basement . We hear the warning sirens above the scuffling of feet and the chatter of the boys . Prof. Sorel comes along hall and stops beside Albert , looks sharply at the disorderly rout of boys . &nbsp; SORELOrder , young men ! Do n't let the girls be better soldiers than the men ! Immediately the boys are quiet and keep in line like the girls . As the last children pass the teachers , Albert , who is nervous , speaks to Sorel who stands beside him watching the children pass down the stair at end of hall a few yards away .  --  34  --  &nbsp; ALBERT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my mother .

The stair is in left f.g . so that the children come down past camera , a little to one side , and spread out as they look for places . There are benches around the stone walls . Sirens less loud down here . The children seem accustomed to this business and we hear their voices now as they call to one another .

SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY SHOOTING THROUGH gate into yard toward school building we see Albert and his mother come hurrying in from left and start across the yard for the main door of school . But suddenly above the screaming sirens we hear the sharp explosions of anti-aircraft guns and Albert , hanging to his mother 's arm , dashes left toward a small door , jerks it open and frantically disappears inside . ( This leads to the second and smaller basement door seen at right in the basement scene. ) 95 INT . SCHOOL BASEMENT - DAY FULL SHOT taking in the crowded grouped children . Louise and Sorel have got them all seated and in their places and have found seats themselves on separate benches .

He closes and bolts the door behind them and returns to his bench , under an electric bulb , as Albert , still clinging to Mrs. Lory 's arm , moves into the midst of the children , a bit wild-eyed . ( Edmond Lorraine sits beside Sorel. ) 96 CLOSE SHOT - Louise on bench at side . The little girl , Emilie , is on the end of the bench , beside her , helping hold the torn pages which Louise is sorting out and putting into a satchel .

Mrs. Lory sits down on the bench without paying any attention to Louise who moves over to make room , and Albert sits between them , next to Louise . Mrs. Lory notices this and after a moment 's thought motions to her son . &nbsp; MRS . LORYSit on this side , darling . There 's a draft in this cellar .

Louise says nothing ; she is busy sorting the pages which she has collected from her girls and putting them into the satchel .

Both listening with the eagerness boys show for airplanes . Julian begins to make the rhythmic growling in imitation of the airplanes we hear , the boys trying to identify the kind of planes .  --  37  --  &nbsp; HENRYFour engines ! &nbsp; JULIANWellingtons ! &nbsp; HENRYNo - Americans !

Things are bad enough as they are ! &nbsp; LOUISE ( looks up quietly from sorting her pages ) I wish I could see the sky full of them , Mrs. Lory . &nbsp; MRS .

Julian nudges the others with a malicious grin and indicates off and they all look at : 105 CLOSE SHOT - Albert and his mother . His mother tries to soothe him , as if he were still a small boy . Guns are pounding and planes growling overhead . There is another hair-raising whistle and a nearer explosion and Albert breaks , burying his face against his mother as she holds him in her arms . 106 CLOSE SHOT on larger group of boys around the ringleaders , Julian and Henry .

Louise , glancing around unhappily and realizing the children are watching Albert , puts her arms around Emilie who is beginning to whimper and cower close to her . &nbsp; LOUISENow , now , Emilie , do n't worry .

Over this the cheerful singing of the children . Albert slowly sits up and leans back , as the little boy , Edmond Lorraine , who alone is not singing , comes in hesitantly from one side and slides onto the bench beside his teacher . DISSOLVE Section Details 118 INT . SOREL 'S OFFICE - DAY Prof. Sorel stands with his back to us , looking out the window but hardly seeing the few children who are running and shouting as they cross the courtyard homewards with their satchels .

Albert enters and shuts door behind him and we can see he is agitated . Sorel turns around to look at him , pitying him and wondering how he can begin , when Albert blurts out :  --  41  --  &nbsp; ALBERTI know what you 're going to say  --  I know I 'm ridiculous . I 'm stupid . I 'm weak . I - I ca n't help it , sir . ( his voice trembles ) I 'm a coward - Sorel raises a hand as if to stop him but he is almost vehement in his agonized confession . &nbsp; ALBERT ( cont 'd ) Yes , I 'm a coward . I ca n't stand violence - it terrifies me . Noise - explosions - something happens to me . I 'm a coward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - they see it - they saw it today - you saw it , sir . Even Miss Martin  --  ( his voice breaks and Sorel cuts in firmly ) &nbsp; SORELSit down , Mr. Lory . Sit down . &nbsp; ALBERT ( choking ) Now she knows I 'm a coward . He sits down heavily in the chair Sorel has indicated and stares miserably at the floor . Sorel studies him for a moment and speaks with quiet sympathy : &nbsp; SORELWould you like to be transferred to a district where there are no air raids ? &nbsp; ALBERT ( looks up in a panic ) No , no , no . &nbsp; SORELBecause of Miss Martin ? &nbsp; ALBERT ( looks down at floor and just whispers ) Yes .  --  42  --  &nbsp; SORELDoes she know how you feel ? &nbsp; ALBERT ( shakes head and whispers - eyes on floor ) No . &nbsp; SOREL ( studying him ) I thought you were a confirmed bachelor like me . Albert looks up at him . &nbsp; SOREL ( cont 'd ) Oh , like all young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and I found a great comfort in my work . Our work . My family became this school - my books , my teachers - you , Miss Martin - my pupils - ( smiles ) - many of them grown up now . ( very gravely ) You know it 's a great thing to be a schoolmaster . It 's a life work , Lory . You sacrifice a lot of things , but you get a lot in return . And now I believe we 're the most important people in our country . It 's a time for sacrifice now , more than ever - and our real happiness lies in our doing our job well . ( indicates the stack of verboten books on his desk ironically ) Our Mayor was in here this morning talking about duty - but I prefer to use the word job . Those books must be burned . Very well , we must burn them . - We ca n't resist physically . But morally , within us , we can resist . We contain those books , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying each and every one of us . We can keep truth alive if the children believe in us and follow our example . ( cont 'd )  --  43  --  &nbsp; SOREL ( cont 'd ) Children like to follow a leader - and they have two kinds of leaders today : We seem weak , we have no weapons , we do n't march - except to air raid shelters - and our heroes are called criminals and shot against walls . The other leaders have guns , tanks , parades , uniforms , they teach violence , self-love , vanity , everything that appeals to the unformed minds of children - and their criminals are called heroes . That 's a lot of competition for us , Lory . Love of liberty is n't glamorous to children . Respect for the human being is n't exciting . But there 's one weapon they ca n't take away from us - and that 's our dignity . It 's going to be a fight - it is a fight , but if the children admire us they will follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision and then the sharp tooting of a locomotive whistle from the railroad terminal in the distance . Albert takes no notice , but Sorel looks up , then disregards it as he speaks to Albert with deep conviction . &nbsp; SOREL ( cont 'd ) We will win , Lory - ( adds whimsically ) - or maybe we will get shot . But every one of us they execute wins a battle for our cause , because he dies a hero - ( smiles ) - and heroism is glamorous for the children . Then he chuckles , seeing Albert 's face illuminated by his words . &nbsp; SOREL ( cont 'd ) I do n't ask you to die , my friend . Not immediately . But if you think these things over I 'm sure it will help you when - ( hesitates to mention air raids ) - when we are visited by our friends in the sky .

Take it home with you . &nbsp; ALBERT ( rising to take it but glancing nervously at the window whence the sounds are rising ) Thank you , professor . Now we hear the whine of a motor siren approaching swiftly along the street outside and Sorel , unable longer to ignore the rising uproar , steps to the open window and looks out into street . 120 EXT .

SWITCH TOWER - DAY Von Keller and his adjutant , Schwartz , are interrogating Paul Martin who stands by the row of big levers that control all the switches at the terminal . Through the big windows we see a maze of tracks and a few locomotives shunting around the yard . Two German soldiers stand just inside the door at the top of the iron stairway outside . The adjutant is taking notes as Von Keller questions Paul , who is very calm and casual . &nbsp; PAULI closed the switch at 4:17 , according to the train dispatcher 's orders . &nbsp; VON KELLERShow me the control . Paul turns to the bank of levers and indicates one that is locked forward . ( Schwartz , throughout all scenes where he is present , watches everything as if he were continually making mental notes . ) &nbsp; PAULThis one , No. 14 . I have n't touched it since . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( watching him keenly ) It seemed to operate all right ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched the freight backing into the terminal - that is , I expected it to go back . But instead it moved out on the main track just as the other train was coming in . It was too late to do anything .  --  47  --  &nbsp; VON KELLER ( as adjutant makes notes ) See if it works now . Paul unlocks the lever and it flops back and forth , freed of any pull . He looks astonished as Von Keller watches his face closely . &nbsp; PAULThe control cable 's broken . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( dryly ) Cut . Paul stares at him . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( cont 'd ) You knew nothing about it ? &nbsp; PAULNo , sir . It was all right when I pulled it . I 'm sure of that . Von Keller turns away and stares out across the tracks , his hands behind his back . &nbsp; VON KELLERYou turned in an illegal newspaper this morning . &nbsp; PAULThat 's right , sir . &nbsp; VON KELLERHave you any idea where it comes from ? &nbsp; PAULNo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do get any idea , will you report it ? &nbsp; PAULI think so .  --  48  --  &nbsp; VON KELLER ( makes a decision as he looks at him keenly ) Martin . This was an accident . You understand ? &nbsp; PAULYes , sir . Without a further word Von Keller nods to his adjutant and they exit . One of the sentries follows and one remains . As the door closes behind them and they vanish , descending the iron stairway , Paul looks with a puzzled grin at the remaining soldier . &nbsp; PAUL ( cont 'd ) What do you think , Otto ? Am I in a jam ? &nbsp; SOLDIER ( a friendly growl ) Nah - ( takes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket ) You smoke and forget it , Paul . &nbsp; PAULThanks. ( taking cigarette , still puzzled ) What 's the old man up to ? Why does he call it an accident ? &nbsp; OTTO ( strikes match , gruffly ) We never ask questions . Section Details 125 EXT .

Where 's Geroge ? &nbsp; JULIE ( indicates door ) In his office . He 's in an awful temper . ( catches Louise 's arm and drops her voice anxiously ) I 'm worried about Paul . I just saw that fat pig leave the switch tower . If the boss calls me , tell him I 've gone to the warehouse . &nbsp; LOUISE ( with a trace of bitterness ) Oh , you do n't need to worry about Paul . She goes to the office door as Julie hurries on out . 126 CLOSE SHOT of door with its lettering as Louise enters , very much perturbed . 127 INT . GEORGE LAMBERT 'S OFFICE - DAY George , the superintendent , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise hurriedly enters to him . Through window behind desk we can see the switch tower against the sky and the smoke of passing trains . Hear train noises . On wall beside window is a small cage , just a box with a wire screen cover at the front , through which we can see two pigeons in the box . &nbsp; LOUISEGeorge  --   --  50  --  &nbsp; GEORGEJust a moment , dear  --  ( goes on into telephone ) No , no . Do n't stop work . Go ahead and load No. 4 . We 'll have the tracks cleared within an hour . Speed it up , now . The men will have to work overtime . . . If there 're any complaints refer them to me . That 's right . Call me back as soon as you 've finished . He hangs up and rises to face Louise who has come anxiously to his desk . &nbsp; GEORGE ( cont 'd ) I 'm afraid I 'm in for some trouble . Did you see the wreck ? Everything 's in a mess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , dear . I do n't understand how it happened . I 've checked with Paul . Everything was all right at the switch tower . You know how hard I 've worked to keep everything moving - but now the chances are they 'll hold me accountable  --  &nbsp; LOUISEI 'm sorry - perhaps I 'm selfish - but I 'm thinking about myself . Something 's happened I do n't understand . &nbsp; GEORGE ( comes out of thinking about himself and looks at her ) What , Louise ? &nbsp; LOUISEI went out to get some things for our dinner tonight . I had to stand in line a long time , and when I got back the house had been searched . I 'd put  --   --  51  --  She breaks off as the door opens and Major von Keller enters with his adjutant , Schwartz . Louise gives Von Keller a swift glance and her face goes cold as she looks away , pretending not to see him . George bows a little as Von Keller comes over to the desk . ( Schwartz just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and covertly scans the papers lying on it . ) &nbsp; VON KELLERExcuse me , Lambert , if I 'm intruding . I thought you were alone . You know my adjutant . &nbsp; GEORGE ( bows ) Yes , sir . I was expecting you . ( turns to the girl , inwardly proud to introduce her to a personage ) Louise , this is Major von Keller . Lieut . Schwartz . . . Miss Martin . Von Keller bows gallantly and slips off his white glove to offer his hand but Louise looks at him coldly and ignores the hand , and he disguises his polite gesture by continuing the movement of his ungloved hand to his breast pocket , taking out his cigarette case as he smiles at her ironically . He directs his speech to George though he continues looking at the cold-faced girl . &nbsp; VON KELLERI know Miss Martin very well , even if she does n't seem to know me . As protector of the town , it 's my duty , Miss Martin , to know what our teachers are teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smile deepens ) How are your " friends in the sky ?

I can come back when you 've finished .  --  52  --  &nbsp; VON KELLER ( before she can move ) Go ahead , Miss Martin , do n't mind me. ( to George , smiling ) She wants to ask you about some papers she 's lost . &nbsp; LOUISE ( turns on him sharply accusing ) Not lost . They were stolen . Schwartz smiles . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( his eyes twinkle ) My report to my superiors says neither . The forbidden pages were burned . ( very pleasantly ) You see we protect the people we like from their own mistakes . &nbsp; GEORGE ( anxiously ) What did you do , Louise ? &nbsp; VON KELLERNothing , Lambert . Nothing at all . . . expect prove our efficiency . &nbsp; LOUISE ( coldly to George as she ignores the Germans ) I 've found out what I wanted to ask you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the Germans as if they were transparent . George is disturbed but as the door closes sharply behind Louise , Von Keller turns to him blandly as if it were a closed incident .  --  53  --  &nbsp; VON KELLERDo n't be disturbed , Lambert . We have more important matters to discuss . I 've just been making an investigation of the wreck . ( stares at George testingly ) A very unfortunate accident , Lambert . &nbsp; GEORGE ( grimly ) I would n't call it an accident , Major von Keller . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( dryly ) Neither would I. It was sabotage . &nbsp; GEORGE ( indignant about the matter ) I knew when they began circulating that illegal newspaper we 'd have trouble . And this wo n't be the end of it . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( eyes him probingly ) Is there anyone you suspect ? &nbsp; GEORGE ( bitterly ) I do n't know . Who prints the newspaper ? You can be sure every workman in the railroad yard gets hold of it . Find the men who print the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KELLER ( dryly ) Very logical - but not very helpful . And not very intelligent for either of us to use the word sabotage . &nbsp; GEORGE ( protests bitterly ) But it is sabotage .  --  54  --  &nbsp; VON KELLERYou do n't understand , my friend . If we call it sabotage I shall have to take hostages from the town - and shoot them finally if the guilty are not found . I do n't like to shoot innocent people and I do n't like to make martyrs - once you begin that it never stops until finally we 'll find ourselves sitting on a powder keg . I 've noticed what happens in our districts which we are protecting . As George looks puzzled , &nbsp; VON KELLER ( cont 'd ) Also the taking of hostages will only make the guilty men more cautious - and the shooting will make them more rebellious ! Next time it will be a troop train that is wrecked . Fortunately , no German soldiers have been killed . Eggs , potatoes , meat - whatever 's been destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The citizens in the town will eat a little less and talk a little more . You ca n't be blamed for an accident - and meantime we keep our ears open . I have many ears , as you know , and you are in touch with all the men who work here . &nbsp; GEORGE ( bitterly ) You think they 'll tell me anything ? No . I 'm the man who gives orders around here - and they regard anyone who gives orders as an enemy . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( nods thoughtfully ) I can remember the time when we had the same problem in Germany - during the Republic , under Capitalism . I fought in the streets for our Fuhrer , Lambert - I killed workers with my own hands . For my class it was either kill or be killed . But we won , and now we are brothers . Absolute obedience !  --  55  --  &nbsp; GEORGE ( with bitterness ) I , too , fought the unions - right in this yard . ( shows a scar on his temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , and you were many . We had no leader and we were few . That 's why you 're here . &nbsp; VON KELLERBut not as your enemy , Lambert . &nbsp; GEORGEIf I thought you were I would n't be doing what I am . &nbsp; VON KELLERI know that . We 're here to help men like you rebuild your own country . Remember what my country was before our Fuhrer . A country without food , without arms , without honor . But the people were not bad , they were only waiting to be told the truth . It 's the glory of the Third Reich that we have shed German blood to give that truth not only to your people but to the Aryans of the whole world . &nbsp; GEORGEYour ideas are exactly my ideas . I saw how our country was destroyed . False democratic ideas - women refusing to have children - strikes in all our factories for a 40 hour week while your people were working 70 and 80 hours a week .

George stares at him curiously .  --  56  --  &nbsp; VON KELLER ( cont 'd ) I 'm glad we understand each other . We are both working for this war to be over . Only then can we have a peaceful and united Europe . And only then can your country - and men like you - regain their dignity and honor . ( extends his hand ) Let us both work for that day . George grips his hand with emotion . DISSOLVE pp. 19-34 &nbsp; pp. 57-72 128 INT . LORY HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT We see a very peaceful and very dull family scene .

We see it is the Juvenal which Sorel lent to him that afternoon . MAT DOWN to the same lines Sorel was reading during the raid : " In order to preserve life , they lose the reason for living . " 129 TWO SHOT as Albert ponders the page and then glances stealthily at his mother again . She takes no notice , absorbed in her paper , and cautiously he looks around , as if the music from next door wore drawing him . As he does so the newspaper slips from her hands and rustles to the floor . Albert looks at her quickly , as if listening off to the music were a guilty act , but sees she has fallen asleep . He watches her a moment and then whispers to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stir and he looks around again in the direction of the sentimental music next door , soft and charming music . After a moment he watches his mother , then gets up very quietly and cautiously .  --  57  --  &nbsp; ALBERT ( cont 'd ) ( murmurs testingly again ) Mother ? She is sound asleep and he softly puts down his book and takes the shawl from his shoulders . He tiptoes , with many a backward glance , to make sure his mother sleeps , to a side door which opens on a garden between the two houses - the Lory home and the Martins ' . 130 SHOT past him at the door . As he opens the door cautiously glancing back across his shoulder to make sure his mother does n't see him , the music is louder and across the garden we see a lighted window . The glass is closed but the shutters are open .

GARDEN - BETWEEN LORY AND MARTIN HOUSES - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT - Albert at side door . Still feeling guilty for what he is doing , he stands and looks around at the sky , like a man observing the night before he turns in . He knows he would still have an excuse if his mother should wake and call . He listens to the music . It is like a magnet and , taking his courage in his hands , he steps from the doorstep and goes across the garden furtively . CAMERA FOLLOWS Albert as he crosses the garden feeling like a burglar . The music grows louder as we approach the Martin house . A low fence between the two small gardens is an unexpected problem which makes him hesitate .

Paul is stretched out in an easy chair playing the love song on his accordion , while Julie Grant sits on the arm of his chair with her arm carelessly around his shoulder as she listens , watching his face adoringly . Near them George Lambert and Louise Martin are sitting on a small sofa and he is talking to her as if nobody else were in the room , persuading her into something obviously , though we can not hear the sounds of their voices .

We see George making an announcement with elaborate pantomime and jokes we do n't hear and then he draws the flushed , laughing Louise up beside him , takes a ring from his pocket and puts it on her engagement finger with a mock-operatic manner and folds her in his arms as he kisses her . Julie claps her hands excitedly and Paul , grinning , plays a wedding march loudly and gaily on his accordion . 136 EXT . MARTIN HOUSE - NIGHT CLOSEUP - Albert as he watches , a look of loneliness and torment on his face . He is shut out from it all , it 's like looking out from the bars of a cage , the cage of his own stupid loneliness , at a happiness which he knows he can never attain . 137 CLOSE SHOT from behind Albert , past whose head we can see part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm and he starts fearfully .

The blackout ! &nbsp; POLICEMAN ( gruffly ) Oh , of course . I saw the light . That 's what I came for . He takes the shutters and closes them , blotting the happy scene from view .

We see that a German soldier has flung the papers out on the sidewalk and now a second soldier emerges from cellar and flings another stack of confiscated newspapers out on sidewalk . Half a dozen German soldiers with bayoneted guns form a cordon around the front of the place . There is a German truck guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germen soldiers come up from the cellar lugging the small printing press which we saw in an earlier scene and following them are two of the three printers whom we saw in the cellar printing the illegal newspaper .

The soldiers throw the small printing press into the truck as the two prisoners emerge from cellar , hands over their heads . 140 MED.SHOT - Von Keller 's Mercedes car parked across street .

The policeman stands with an eye on the queue . Suddenly the people of the queue begin to make a strange noise in unison without moving their lips - **40;2612;TOOLONG etc - a sort of menacing murmur with a beat in it . The policeman , like a man who has to play the part of a good officer , shouts at them angrily : &nbsp; POLICEMANQuiet !

Immediately the three men emerge from behind bush , and two of them run to Paul as the third goes quickly to a closed gate in the opposite fence . Paul is already jerking off his coat and we can see his left shirt sleeve is reddened with blood . The two men have a coat and a hat , the coat of a different color from the one Paul rips off .

Corporal Heinz is certain one of the shots took effect . ) Von Keller straightens up , looks at Schneider for an instant and then nods pleasantly . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( in German ) ( Very stupid . You may go . ) The sergeant salutes and exits and von Keller shuts off the music box and sits on the edge of his desk , swinging a leg and staring at the uneasy Mayor a little grimly now . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( cont 'd ) Well , that settles it .

We can see in this close shot that the wound is slight , just a flesh wound in his left forearm . CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to take in a window that looks out on the street and we see Louise and Albert returning from the school . Albert is carrying her books like a schoolboy lover . They stop outside window ( in front of door which we can not see ) and she takes the books from Albert and sees him looking at the ring on her finger .

Albert musters a stern face and claps his hands at them sharply - and ineffectually . &nbsp; ALBERTQuiet , please ! I 'm very disappointed in you . A loud miaow comes from somewhere though the boys sit very quiet . Albert 's voice is kind , trying still to appeal to their hearts , which makes his failure the more absurd and touching . &nbsp; ALBERT ( cont 'd ) This is a place of learning and culture , and the first requisite of culture is good manners - Miaow , miaow , miaow - but he ignores them . &nbsp; ALBERT ( cont 'd ) I 've done my best to preserve dignity in this classroom , but if you continue to misbehave I shall have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds from the boys .

But I confess I do n't find myself grieving for the innocence of Sorel . Your own hostility to me reflects his teaching . And you pass it on to your children . These ideas are a contagion and the place to stamp them out is in the schools . You can make a child believe whatever you want , and the children of today are the soldiers and mothers of tomorrow . Ten years ago our German children were like yours . But we National Socialists threw out the Sorels and took charge of the schools - and look at them now : heroes who have conquered the world . &nbsp; LOUISE ( gets up in horror ) No , no .

Mrs. Lory 's pride , a set of old china , tumbles from the shelf a top the cupboard and crashes on the floor , just as Mrs. Lory comes running in , followed by the sergeant and the alarmed Albert .

The man blinks and does n't move though tears come to his eyes . Albert flinches at the brutality of the act and even Mrs. Lory is startled . The sergeant turns very politely to Mrs. Lory , as if he had proved the correctness of Nazi behaviour . &nbsp; SERGEANT ( cont 'd ) Are you satisfied , lady ? &nbsp; MRS . LORY ( indignantly ) No !

Albert goes to front door to put the cat out but something catches his eye . 222 What he sees : A small newspaper half under the rug where it has been surreptitiously slid under door during the night .

In another wall is a door leading into living room . The door is closed but from the living room we hear the mayor 's little girl practising her scales on the piano with painful persistence - da da da da ta ti ta da da et cetera , over and over as the two men talk in f.g . On the dining room walls are a couple of large stuffed fish , proud catches of the mayor , and an oil painting of himself in the full regalia of his office . Furnishings in the usual bad taste .

FRENCH STREET - OUTSIDE PRISON DOOR - DAY WIDE ANGLE on prison door , early next morning . An unknown old woman , shawled and carrying a few pieces of firewood she has collected , is passing along the sidewalk . Two German soldiers , patrols , come striding past from opposite direction , but she does n't look at them . CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on door as we hear bolts clanking and the small door ( which opens from the big double doors of the prison gate ) is opened from within and Albert Lory steps out . The soldier guard stands in the doorway behind him . Albert looks a little dazed , like a man in a happy dream . He is unshaven , looks a trifle dishevelled , his hair mussed , but otherwise perfectly normal . He looks around a little confused and then turns politely to the soldier guard who is in the act of closing the door . &nbsp; ALBERTGood-bye . Thank you . He walks happily past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First a CLOSE SHOT at window and we see Louise 's cat mewing outside and rubbing against the glass . The window is opened by a woman 's hands and the cat comes in . CAMERA PULLS BACK SWIFTLY to show that none other than Mrs. Lory ( a very different Mrs. Lory from the angry woman we last saw ) has let the cat in . Mrs. Lory bustles about , fixing the breakfast table as usual . Then she hears a step and runs to the front window and as she pulls back the curtain to look , the door opens and Albert comes in , dishevelled as we saw him a few minutes ago . Mrs. Lory puts her arms around him joyously and kisses him .  --  118  --  &nbsp; MRS . LORYOh my boy ! My boy ! &nbsp; ALBERT ( all smiles ) Hello , Mother . &nbsp; MRS .

That 's just like a man  --  talk , talk , talk , and let the women worry . &nbsp; ALBERT ( puts his arm around her ) Oh , I worried about you , Mother . ( with a serious expression ) But Professor Sorel explained a lot of things to me I did n't understand . Now I know why our country fell  --  some people were more afraid of our own workers than they were of the enemy . &nbsp; MRS . LORYNonsense !  --  119  --  &nbsp; ALBERTNo , look at our mayor , Maybe now he 's very unhappy  --  it has n't worked out the way he expected  --  but he was glad to shake hands with the German commander when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to silence him , spoofing at the very idea ) Sssh !

LORYI do n't see why they do n't have more privacy in that prison ! Crowding people together ! If you 'd slept last night instead of talking to that old windbag you would n't look so tired . &nbsp; ALBERT ( not liking her talk ) I 'm worried about Professor Sorel  --  they did n't release him . I 'm the only one they let out .

You know what happened to Paul ! That 's why you 're free ! Albert , as if he had been struck in the face , makes a feeble gesture of denial with his arms and the cat falls to the floor .

He blinks , looking at her as if he could n't remember who she is . She takes hold of his arm , her voice hard . &nbsp; MRS . LORYDo n't let that girl hurt you . She 's mixed up in it too - just like that brother of hers . He was to blame for putting you in prison . &nbsp; ALBERT ( stammers blankly ) But he 's - he 's dead . &nbsp; MRS .

A locomotive hoots in the distance and then we hear the chuff-chuff-chuff as it backs in on a siding . George seems to see nothing but the switch tower in the distance . From the next office we hear the swift clicking of typewriters , mingling in the symphony of sounds of the busy railroad terminal . 263 CLOSEUP - George as he stares out window at the gray sky , absorbed in gloomy thought .

Only that fool schoolmaster - ( grins ) After that scare I do n't think we 'll have any trouble keeping him in line . One for one - a fair trade and good business .

Mechanically fastidious , he takes his handkerchief and wipes the blood from his fingers .

As he is holding it we see the door open in b.g. and the little Clerk peera in. 272 CLOSE SHOT - little Clerk peering in through door . His eyes widen and then leap with panic .

This session stands adjourned . DISSOLVE Section Details 323 INT . PRISON CELL - NIGHT Small stone-walled room , a cot , a chair , a table , a pail under the bed . A heavy solid door opens on the corridor . In the opposite wall a small barred window . Wooden shutters are closed outside the bars . Albert sits on a stool in his shirt sleeves , his old coat on his knees , deeply absorbed in trying to sew the torn pocket lining of his coat . He does it very awkwardly . There is utter silence . After a moment we hear an accordion outside , far away . Albert lifts his head listening and we recognize the love song which Paul Martin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin house and saw Louise and the others . It brings Louise before his mind 's eye and he begins humming it softly and a little off-key . He begins sewing again but stops abruptly as we hear the bolt clank outside the heavy door . The door swings open and Albert rises surprised as Von Keller enters and nods to the jailer who shuts and bolts the door behind him . Von Keller is very amiable and polite . &nbsp; VON KELLERGood evening , Lory  --  ( chuckles as he indicates the coat in Albert 's hands ) Ah , I heard about that torn pocket . You lost your speech . But you did all right from all accounts  --  ( looks at the bed ) May I sit down ? &nbsp; ALBERT ( equally polite , peering at him innocently and curiously ) Please . Of course .  --  143  --  &nbsp; VON KELLER ( sits down and looks at him , very friendly ) Sit down , Lory . Albert sits down and Von Keller studies him pleasantly . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( cont 'd ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real courage . &nbsp; ALBERT ( hardly believing his ears ) Oh , no  --  no  --  &nbsp; VON KELLER ( stops him with an upraised hand ) I know what you said in court  --  but you 're wrong . I know more about you than you do yourself . ( smiles faintly ) I was a fool not to realize it sooner . ( takes out his cigarette case , opens and extends it ) Cigarette ? Albert is just about to say no when to his own surprise he changes his mind . He takes one . &nbsp; ALBERTThank you . Von Keller lights it for him , watching his face , and he puffs awkwardly , holding it like a woman ; then coughs and smiles apologetically through the smoke . &nbsp; ALBERT ( cont 'd ) It 's my second one . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( suddenly grins , and speaks sincerely ) Lory , I like you ! ( cont 'd )  --  144  --  Von Keller lights his own cigarette and studies Albert , who shows no dislike of him ) &nbsp; VON KELLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a great mistake in court today . You called yourself a coward , but you disproved it by what you said . Now they know you killed Lambert . &nbsp; ALBERT ( very earnestly ) But I did n't . &nbsp; VON KELLERNow come , come , I 'm not here to convict you , I want to save you . I 'm your friend . &nbsp; ALBERTBut I told the truth . I did n't . Von Keller stares at him incrodulously and it dawns on him that unquestionably the man is telling the truth . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( astounded ) Lory ! I believe you ! ( half to himself , with surprise ) And now I remember the way Lambert looked when I left him . ( staring at Albert ) It 's incredible ! ( very pleased with the situation suddenly ) That makes it very easy . Lambert was despondent because of losing Miss Martin  --  the police will find a suicide note . We can handle the jury and you 'll be acquitted .

A poet ! &nbsp; ALBERT ( slowly ) I do n't understand why you 're trying to save me . &nbsp; VON KELLERI told you . I like you . &nbsp; ALBERTI see . You do n't want me to say anything more in the courtroom . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( very friendly and confidential ) My dear Lory , it 's a peculiar situation . A courtroom is a public forum . Of course we Germans could take over courts , schools , town halls , the administration of the whole country  --  but we 're not tyrants  --  we prefer not to do that . We prefer to collaborate , to give freedom to the nations we defeat on the battlefield . But freedom must be limited by the necessities of war . We 're still fighting on other fronts . It 's a very small sacrifice we ask of you , when we are still sacrificing our lives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his understanding expanding ; Von Keller smiles . &nbsp; VON KELLER ( cont 'd ) You see I 'm frank , I have nothing to conceal . I tell you these things because you 're a man of intelligence . Lambert was just a tool , very honest but not very bright . The Mayor  --  you were right in the courtroom  --  he 's working for his own interests . But  --  ( shrugs )  --  we need them and we find them in every country we invade . ( cont 'd )  --  146  --  &nbsp; VON KELLER ( cont 'd ) ( smiles ) Even in Germany we used them . That was the way our Party got into power . They 're everywhere . ( with a touch of fanatical faith ) That 's why nothing can stop us from winning the world . America feels secure because of her oceans  --  they think of invasion in terms of armies and airplanes  --  but they 're already invaded . The honest Lamberts and the dishonest Manvilles are waiting to welcome us  --  just as they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time we need peace --  if peace becomes a further weapon of conquest  --  their sincere patriotism will find plenty of arguments for the peace . ( laughs ) After all , what is the United States ? A charming cocktail of Irish and Jews . Very spectacular but childish . And England ? A few old ladies wearing their grandfathers ' leather britches. ( gets up , very pleased with himself ) Well , what do you say , Lory ? &nbsp; ALBERT ( rises politely ) Thank you  --  could I have another cigarette ? &nbsp; VON KELLER ( laughs as he takes out his case ) All you want , all you want ! &nbsp; ALBERT ( taking one ) Thank you . Just one . Von Keller raps on the door for the jailer , then looks at Albert who watches him curiously .  --  147  --  &nbsp; VON KELLERLory , I 'm glad you 've decided to live  --  and be a free man . You 're a schoolmaster and you have a great duty  --  the regeneration of the youth . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe me , it will be a fine world . The jailer opens the heavy door from the outside and he goes out .

Albert has his shirt off and looks a little absurd , plumply absurd , as he shaves himself , peering at a little metal mirror which is propped on a ledge of the stone wall . His face is lathered . As we have FADED IN we have heard the feet of tramping soldiers somewhere outside and now they grow louder , ringing on stone flagging as they pass . Albert stops shaving to listen . He tries to see out through the small barred window but it is too high . He gets the stool and climbs up on it shakily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lathered face appears behind bars . He sees : 326 EXT .

Suddenly we hear Albert 's voice screaming from a distance : &nbsp; ALBERT 'S VOICEProfessor Sorel ! Professor Sorel ! Sorel looks off , but sees foggily , having on the wrong glasses . Automatically he reaches into his handkerchief pocket , gets out his far-seeing glasses , puts them on , recognizes Albert  --  smiles and waves . 329 EXT .

Then he opens his eyes and looks , the frenzy going from his face which seems to fill with strength and resolution . It is as if the explosions of their rifles had smashed through a window in his mind and now he sees a new and unknown world . DISSOLVE 330 EXT . COURTHOUSE - DAY - ( RKO PATHE ) FULL SHOT - courthouse .

Albert is already in the prisoner 's dock between the two guards . Jurors and judges seated , as are all the spectators . The room is crowded now . On the front bench is a new figure , Mayor Manville , waiting to be called . Louise sits with Mrs. Lory and Julie . Schwartz sits off inconspicuously at one side with his notebook . &nbsp; PRESIDING JUDGEYou may call your witness , Mr. Prosecutor . &nbsp; PROSECUTOR ( rises with the important pleased manner of a man who is going to right a great wrong ) If the court pleases , it will not be necessary to call Mayor Manville .

It 's in the handwriting of the deceased George Lambert and was mailed at the railroad station shortly before his death . He hands it up to the judge and the two other judges lean close to look at it . &nbsp; PROSECUTOR ( cont 'd ) I offered it in evidence . 335 CLOSE SHOT Albert who loans forward , confounded . &nbsp; PROSECUTOR 'S VOICEIt saves us from a serious miscarriage of justice because it clearly shows that the deceased George Lambert intended suicide . 336 CLOSE SHOT - Mrs. Lory and Louise . Louise listens with an intent face but Mrs. Lory 's face floods with joy . Albert 's voice rings out : &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 337 FULL SHOT . Everyone is rigid as the prosecutor whirls on Albert who stands in the dock , leaning on the rail .

The prosecutor wrote that letter to himself . . . He 's trying to save my life ! There is a sharp laugh and then the whole room goes into a roar of laughter at the apparent hilarity of the situation , and the comedy is heightened by Albert 's earnestness . The judge pounds in vain for order to be restored and finally the laughter dies away as the prosecutor strides over before the judges indignantly . &nbsp; PROSECUTOR ( angrily ) This is certainly no laughing matter , Your Honor . For the sake of the dignity of this court I respectfully ask that the man who started that unseemly outburst be forcibly removed from this room !  --  152  --  340 CLOSE SHOT - judges . &nbsp; PRESIDING JUDGEThe court agrees with you , Mr. Prosecutor .

He looks very angry and uneasy , as if he 'd like to be out of the room .  --  154  --  350 FULL SHOT as Albert turns to the jury but addressing the whole crowded room . &nbsp; ALBERTI 'm a very lucky man . I had a moment of weakness last night - I wanted to live . And I had good reasons to live . Major von Keller told me beautiful things about the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's very hard for people like you and me to understand what is evil and what is good . It 's easy for working people to know who the enemy is because the aim of this War and this Occupation is to make them slaves . But middle-class people like us can easily believe as George Lambert did - that a German victory is n't such a bad thing . You hear people say that too much liberty brings chaos and disorder . That 's why I was tempted last night by Major von Keller when he came to my cell : ( now in wonderful control not only of himself but of the whole crowded room ) But this morning I looked out through bars and saw this beautiful now world working . I saw ten men die because they still believed in freedom - ( with emotion ) - and among them was a man I loved , Prof. Sorel . He smiled and waved to me , as if he were telling me what to do . I knew then I had to die - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( white-faced and grim ) Your Honor , I demand an adjournment . I object to this insane talk ! &nbsp; PRESIDING JUDGEQuiet , please .  --  155  --  &nbsp; ALBERT ( looks at the judges , very proud and happy ) Those ten men died because of Paul Martin . But they did n't blame Paul Martin  --  they were proud of him . Paul was a soldier . Without glory but in a wonderful cause . I see now that sabotage is the only weapon left to a defeated people - and so long as we have saboteurs the other free nations who are still fighting on the battlefields will know that we 're not defeated . I know that for every German killed , many of our innocent citizens are executed . But the example of their heroism is contagious , and our resistance grows . It 's very easy to talk about heroism in the free countries - but it 's hard to talk about it here where our people are starving . The hard truth is that the hungrier we get the more we need our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it does n't pay . . . . It does pay . It makes us suffer , starve and die  --  but though it increases our misery it will shorten our slavery . That 's a hard choice , I know . ( eyes glow with his belief ) But even now they are bringing more troops into this town because of the trouble that has started - and the more German soldiers here the less they have on the fighting fronts . Even an occupied town like this can be a fighting front too - and the fighting is harder . ( looks around the room with compassion ) We not only have to fight hunger and a tyrant . First we have to fight ourselves . This Occupation - any Occupation in any land - is only possible because we are corrupt . ( cont 'd )  --  156  --  &nbsp; ALBERT ( cont 'd ) ( touches his heart ) I accuse myself first . The flesh is weak . For my own comfort and security I made no protest against the mutilation of truth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and milk - by a subterfuge , and I accepted it without facing the fact that I was depriving children and people poorer than we were of their portion . ( points at a juror ) 351 CLOSE SHOT - Mr. Noble in the jury box . &nbsp; ALBERT 'S VOICEYou are the butcher , Mr. Noble . Naturally you wanted to survive - and the black market was the answer . You keep your business going by selling meat out the back door at ten times its price . Some to my mother , who was equally guilty , as I was in eating it . 352 CLOSE SHOT - Mr. Milette next to Noble . He begins to wither at the sound of Albert 's voice . &nbsp; ALBERT 'S VOICEYou , Mr. Milette , are doing very well in your hotel , even though it 's filled with Germans . You 've never sold so much champagne and at such a good price . Of course , they print the money for nothing but with this money you 're buying properties , just as the mayor is. 353 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; ALBERT 'S VOICEI could say the same about many of you . If the Occupation lasts long enough the men who are taking advantage of it will own the town . ( cont 'd )  --  157  --  &nbsp; ALBERT 'S VOICE ( cont 'd ) I do n't blame you for making money - you should blame yourselves for making the Occupation possible - because you ca n't do these things without playing into the hands of the real rulers of the town , the Germans . 354 INT . COURTROOM - DAY FULL SHOT . Everyone is spellbound as Albert looks at the juror . &nbsp; ALBERTThat 's why I know you must condemn me to die . Not because I killed George Lambert , which I did n't , but because I 've tried to tell the Truth . And the Truth ca n't be allowed to live under the Occupation . It 's too dangerous . This Occupation lives upon lies , just as the whole evil world they call the New Order does . Officially you will find me guilty of murder  --  355 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful and compassionate . &nbsp; ALBERTBut do n't worry , my friends . Even if you acquitted me and I walked out of this courtroom a free man , the enemy would take me and put me against a wall . 356 CLOSE SHOT - jurors spellbound . &nbsp; ALBERTAnd you , too . They can find any reason to take hostages . ( then he turns and looks at Louise , smiling a little ) There 's one final charge I must answer to , and I 'm very guilty . Yesterday I was ashamed when the Prosecutor accused me of loving you , Louise .  --  158  --  glowing with pride and love for him . &nbsp; ALBERT 'S VOICE ( triumphantly ) It 's true . I 've always loved you , secretly . But now I 'm not ashamed . I 'm proud , and I do n't want to keep it a secret . I want to tell the whole world . Tears in Louise 's eyes . 358 CLOSE SHOT - Albert , as he smiles at her tenderly and proudly . &nbsp; ALBERTI do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to die - but I feel very young . ( leans on the rail and looks around the room , shyly proud , as if confiding another secret ) Last night Major von Keller told me something very funny . He told me I was n't a coward - ( laughs ) I think he was right . He turns and looks at : 359 CLOSE SHOT of the three judges listening with smiling dignity . &nbsp; ALBERT 'S VOICEAnd I think I 'm not the only one who 's not a coward  --  360 FULL SHOT - as he looks all around the room proudly . &nbsp; ALBERTThis town is full of courage .

To everyone 's astonishment , including Albert 's , the president of the jury , Mr. Noble , the butcher , stands up in the box . &nbsp; MR .

They come walking along the sidewalk like two children , unashamedly holding hands , and Louise 's face is transfigured , bursting with pride of Albert , who is equally proud of her - his face glowing with joy and pride and dignity . We hear the accordion gaily playing the love song which is like a theme of their love . But the most stupendous thing of this walk which is a triumphal march through the town , is the reaction of the citizens they pass and who come flocking out of the doorways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . They stand aside with respect , lifting their hats almost solemnly and Albert gaily nods and smiles this way and that to them as he passes . Suddenly the little pot-bellied man , who is afflicted with " indigestion " comes hurrying out of a doorway , steps in close as he takes off his hat respectfully , seizes Albert 's hand and shakes it , tears in his eyes . Then he steps back , holding his hat , as Albert passes on with Louise . As more and more citizens come flocking out to pay their proud tribute to him , we begin to hear schoolbells ringing over the music , the bells growing louder as they near the school - and even the bells are gay and happy .
