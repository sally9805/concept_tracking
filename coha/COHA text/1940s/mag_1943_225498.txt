A handful of top-flight naval aviators in a Navy building projection room in Washington last week intently watched the latest Walt Disney film . It was no Donald Duck comedy they were watching , but the newest training film for Navy fighter pilots . It was also another achievement for a veteran airman whom Navy flyers recognize as their best fighter tactician . <P> Lieut . Commander John Smith Thach , whose rich voice came from the sound track , has busied himself with air tactics since the early ' 30s , with a combination of studious analysis and flying virtuosity rarely found in fighter pilots . Result of this preoccupation aloft and on the ground is that today Navy fighters call Thach " the Navy Chennault " and universally use his tactics . They know they are good ; Thach himself proved them in battle . <P> Arkansas-born John Thach entered Annapolis ( in 1923 ) with the fixed conviction that a handful of sea water was blue , emerged four years later with a burning urge to fly , which the Navy speedily gratified . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With other youngsters , like Lieut . Commander " Jimmy " Flatley , he shouted for more training in deflection shooting - i.e. , " leading " the enemy plane , as a hunter fires ahead of a speeding duck to intercept his course . From gunnery it was a short step to tactics-the science of placing and maneuvering planes to do the most damage to the enemy . <P> The Two-Plane Section . By constant experiment and discussion ( often by long and argumentative letters ) , Thach , Flatley and other young airmen finally agreed that the old-fashioned three-plane " V " section was outdated . Their substitute : a two-plane section which was nimbler , deadlier . <P> Not until last year , when he was 37 - and senile by R.A.F. and U.S. Army fighter-pilot standards - did " Jimmy " Thach have a chance to prove his point . At the Battle of Bougainville , his Fighter Squadron Three rose from the Lexington against 20 Jap planes , knocked down , 19 , lost none . ( Fighter Three 's crack-shooting " Butch " O'Hare got five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved . <P> The Four-Plane Division . Flatley 's progression from this was to a division of six planes ; Thach argued for four . Mid way settled the argument , in Thach 's favor . Escorting a torpedo squadron , Jim my Thach led a. six-plane division from the Yorktown . More than 20 Zeros swarmed down , nailed two of his six , but the other four , flying in the unbroken formation that modern battle demands , picked off three Zeros and fought through . ( Fighting Three 's record in that battle : 70 Jap " probables " against seven lost . ) That day , for the first time , Fighting Three proved another tactic of its leader : the Thach Weave , a protective maneuver ( secret ) based on the four-plane division . <P> And Thach got handsome recognition : his second Navy Cross ( for valor in battle ) and the Distinguished Service Medal ( for leadership , pilot-training and the development of combat tactics ) .                 @ @ @ @
