txt Several events of the past week must have given different aspects of the country 's position in the world and of its home affairs a new reality in people 's minds . The President 's radio address of Thursday night was accepted by those of all shades of opinion on its statesmanship as adding to our commitments on Great Britain 's behalf and so increasing the risk ot involvement . At the same time its omission of any reference to Japan could easily be interpreted as a bid for Japanese abstention from further Axis partnership . At home , Mr. Morgenthau 's startlingly frank discussion of price factors and consequences quite clearly opened an Administration struggle with the farm group , probably bringing the troublesome price problem nearer to a solution of sorts . Persistently rising commodity prices , in the face of all homilies against inflation , emphasized the seriousness of that question . Meanwhile the defense management organization carried further its elaborate and unavoidable interference with the ordinary processes of industrial production . ? ? ? ? To the Secretary of the Treasury has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional den . His Boston address was the most forthright treatment of his theme that has yet come from a member of the Administration . Plainly enough , it was intended to begin the conversion of the farm group to a radically new point of view . It followed by a few days the promulgation by- the Secretary of Agriculture of the 1942 farm program , which accords with Mr. Morgenthau 's position in respect to expanding production but contemplates high and even higher prices to generate abundance : . Probably the outcome will fall somewhere between these programs ; that is , higher prices all around but somewhere held In check by expanding production and the psychological effect on markets of unsold accumulations , even though some of these should be frozen In the ' . government 's hands . Farm state Senators are threatening to attempt this maneuver , again , despite the President 's veto of their first try at it . ? Mr. Morgenthau gaveii-minor place in his anti-inflation program to an adaptation of the Keynes forced savings device . It will hardly be enacted precisely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of higher social security tax rates for unemployment reserves . The Secretary also extended a short olive branch toward the Federal Reserve Board by speaking approvingly of general credit controls . In its September bulletin ( evidently ' written before Mr. Morgenthau spoke in Boston ) the Board reiterated its arguments in favor of raising the statutory maximum of required bank reserves , a project it formally launched as long ago as last December . Spreading realization of the number and importance of the public men who are now joining the anti-inflation campaign and of the strength of the case they are making , was probably responsible for the reaction in the major commodity markets on Friday , after their vigorous advances earlier in the week . Their recent history , however , has been marked by resumption of the upward movement after each setback . The farm state . Senators are proclaiming the simple justice of $2 wheat and 30-cent cotton . Mr. Morgenthau 's work is cut out for him . ? ? ? That the new defense program " set-up has made some progress in clarifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater vigor with which it issued orders to private industry during the past week . For the first time it forbade a corporation to build a new plant unless it could prove that its construction would not require materials immediately essential to defense works . Thus the burden ot proof is shifted and , in effect , the SPAB 's word becomes law . Right or wrong , action of this sort helps bring to fruition our long talk about sacrifices in a national emergency . There ' will , of course , be much more of this . Another phase of sacrifice is evident in the fact that the " Big Three " in motors , which ordinarily produce 90% of total car and truck output , have received less than 80% of defense contracts assigned to the automobile industry ; they will be required to cut their commercial production by 50% or more , compared with 16% to 36% for the smaller units . Apparently the " undue concentration of economic power " will undergo some changes during the defense emergency . For the present , the main point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving . ? ? ? Passage of the 1941 revenue bill this week is predicted by those in charge of it . The new tax rates promise to add $31/2 billion to annual Treasury income , making it perhaps $12.7 billion next year . But revised estimates of total expenditure in 1942 now hover around $22 billion .. In July and August last past it was just under an annual rate of $19 billion . The Treasury deficit for the next year , therefore , will be little if any less than it was estimated five or six months ago . The tax bill drafters are barely keeping up with the disbursing officers , rough as the former are .
