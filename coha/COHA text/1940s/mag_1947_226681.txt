As the New Year opened , the survival of Western democracy rested , at bottom , on the case the U.S. would make for it ; on a strong , stable and friendly America depended the stability of the Western world . This week , as the U.S. Congress prepared to convene , the world watched with hope , suspicion and respect . <P> The Republicans , now majority members for the first time in 14 years , were in a businesslike mood . In their own words they wanted to " get things done , go home and give the people a breather . " They were acutely aware that Americans find it hard to breathe in a thick political atmosphere . This session , majority leaders fervently hoped , would finish its work by July 1 . <P> Priorities . The bills marked by the majority leadership as of top importance were all designed to straighten out the economic and social disorders in the nation . <P> Appropriations had to be reduced . That was the first item on the Republican agenda . Taxes also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.O.P. fiscal experts did not talk so confidently as they once had of whacking off appropriations and slashing taxes 20% ; closer study of the problems had made them more cautious . Nevertheless , they would attack with vigor . <P> Labor legislation was next . To the long list of things to do ( e.g. , revise the Wagner Act , possibly outlaw the closed shop ) party leaders added legislation to head off the economic blitz recently launched by labor lawyers with the portal-to-portal pay drive ( see BUSINESS ) . In the first 48 hours probably a hundred labor bills will be dumped into the hopper . <P> The Republicans also proposed to solve the housing problem , so bungled by the Truman Administration that the solution must be started all over again . Other domestic matters , such as the seating of Mississippi 's Senator-elect Theodore Bilbo ( see below ) , will get their early attention . Such important questions as integration of the armed services and universal military training will be postponed until the GOPriority legislation is well on its way to becoming law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority will fix an immediate and searching eye on foreign borrowing . That problem they consider as urgent as the " must " domestic legislation . The world will watch closely . In the Republican philosophy , unlimited money can not be laid out for foreign loans without creating inflationary debt in the U.S. Inflation in the U.S. would mean certain economic disaster for the world . The Republican hand will not be as wide open as the hand of the last Democratic Congresses . <P> The 80th Congress will re-examine the reciprocal trade program created by Cordell Hull ; Nebraska 's high-tariff Senator Hugh Butler has written Assistant Secretary of State Clayton asking him to postpone trade negotiations with 18 nations . Republican Congressmen would like to scrutinize some 3,000 pending trade agreement items before any agreements are made under the blanket authority delegated by Democratic Congresses to the President . <P> Squeals and Creaks . Carefully , even painfully , G.O.P. leaders picked the men to boss the party 's legislative campaign . These men will be the influential chairmen of House and Senate committees . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeals in the party 's post-election harmony .
