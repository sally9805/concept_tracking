New York Frame &; Picture Co. celebrated a birthday last week ( its 47th ) by giving away etchings to anyone who applied . In its 47 years the company has had much experience in mounting mementos : it has framed bridal veils , ashes of the dead , love letters , canceled checks aggregating several billions of dollars . Biggest one : $146,000,000 . An elderly businessman once brought in a baby dress his mother made him , had it framed for great-grandchildren . Lately a soldier came into the shop looking for a picture of General MacArthur , and met his long-lost brother , a sailor , who was having his marriage certificate framed .
