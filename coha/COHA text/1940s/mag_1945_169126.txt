Strong where they had once been weak , advancing where they had once retreated , U.S. troops last week marched south from Lingayen Gulf toward Manila . They followed much the same route that the 26th Cavalry , 51st ( Philippine ) Infantry and Filipino Scouts had taken in the heart-breaking retreat toward Bataan in 1941 . <P> But the forces that made the first , unopposed gains on Luzon last week were no mere regiments or elements of regiments : they were the XIV Corps of Lieut . General Walter Krueger 's Sixth Army . They were armed with weapons which had been designers ' dreams three years ago . They were tough and junglewise . They were backed by fleets and air forces which dwarfed those of the enemy . They knew that in reserve were other corps to keep the drive rolling in high . General MacArthur was on his way to Manila . To secure the island of Luzon , he had four and a half months of dry weather , which should be enough . <P> MacArthur 's intention to free Luzon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just where he would choose to land . From agents on Luzon , working secret radios , MacArthur knew that the Jap Army had skimped the defenses of Lingayen Gulf . To keep the enemy off balance , he moved into Marinduque and sent raiding parties to southern Luzon . Thus , even when the great expedition had been mounted and was under way , the Japs still did not know its destination . <P> Part the First . So vast was the armada under Vice Admiral Thomas Cassin Kinkaid that it was divided into four : 1 ) bombardment and fire-support group , under Vice Admiral Jesse Barrett Oldendorf ( victor of Surigao Strait ) ; 2 ) close cover group , under Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey ; 3 ) San Fabian Attack Force , with troops for the northern beachhead , under Vice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey ; 4 ) Lingayen Attack Force , with troops for the southern beachhead , under Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson . <P> Oldendorf 's heavyweights , the armored tip of the spear , were days ahead of the other groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised from the mud of Pearl Harbor , which had fought so well at Surigao . His jeep carriers opened an air umbrella as he bored past Mindoro into the South China Sea . <P> In three hours , Oldendorf 's ships had to beat off a hundred Jap fighters and fighter bombers , attacking in twos &; threes , concentrating first on the jeep carriers . Some enemy planes scored : at least one " big ship " took a hit on a forward turret ; her captain was wounded , and there was great danger of magazine explosions . But damage and fire-control crews showed superb courage and skill . The ship kept formation and ploughed on . <P> Feint in the Night . While still under enemy observation , Oldendorf swept on to the north , past the entrance to Lingayen Gulf . Perhaps the Japs would think he was going to Vigan . But in the night he turned back . The sea approaches to Lingayen Gulf had been scantily mined . With little difficulty , his ships reached their bombardment runs and opened fire with everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santiago Island answered briefly and were soon put out of action . Jap aircraft attacked , again for three hours .
