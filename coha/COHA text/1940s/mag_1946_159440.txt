The United Nations shipping pool , greatest transportation enterprise in history , was breaking up . Seventeen seafaring nations , whose merchantmen had carried the war-winning cargoes , gathered this week in London to plan the demise of the United Maritime Authority ( due to expire March 2 ) and decide what part of the common effort for war should be turned to the common tasks of reconstruction . <P> Their most urgent problem was to move enormous amounts of relief and rehabilitation supplies ( some sent by UNRRA , some purchased by foreign governments ) to ravaged countries . At least twelve million tons of grain , nine million tons of coal must reach Europe from the Americas before July . Needy countries will call for other foods , clothing , fuels , building supplies and machinery . Long port delays , irregular schedules , return trips in ballast , diversions to out-of-the-way points , make this type of carrying unpopular with private shipowners , eager to get back to lucrative regular runs . It will be a job largely for the nations with " surplus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Pre-eminent among the " surplus " nations is the U.S. War sinkings , war building had wrought many changes in the world 's merchant fleets , and none more striking than the towering tonnage supremacy of the U.S. merchant marine ( more than half the world total ) . <P> Led by Acting War Shipping Administrator Captain Granville Conway ( successor to Vice Admiral Emory S. Land ) , the U.S. will propose a modified UMA for six months after March 2 , hopes it will lead to a permanent shipping agency under UNO .
