PORTRAIT OF A MURDERER A STORY BY Q. PATRICK T r-rims is the story of a murder . It was a murder committed so subtly , so smoothly that I , who was an unwitting accessory both before and after the fact , had no idea at the time that any crime had been committed . Only gradually , with the years , did that series of incidents , so innocuous-seeming at the time , fall into a pattern in my mind and give me a clear picture of exactly what happened during my stay at Olinscourt with Martin Slater . Martin and I were at an English school together during the latter half of the First World War . In his fourteenth year Martin was a nondescript boy with light , untidy hair , quick brown eyes , and that generic schoolboy odor of rubber and chalk . There was little to distinguish him from the rest of us except his father , Sir Olin Slater . Sir Olin , however , was more than enough to make Martin painfully notorious . Whereas self-respecting parents embarrassed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Sports Day or Prize-giving , Sir Olin haunted his son like a passion . Almost every week this evangelical baronet could be seen , a pink , plump hippopotamus , walking about the school grounds , his arm entwined indecently round Martin . In his free hand he would carry a large bag of chocolates which he offered to all the boys he met with pious adjurations to lead nobler , sweeter lives . Martin squirmed under these paraded embraces . It was all the worse for him in that his father suffered from a terrible disease of the throat which made every syllable he uttered a pathetic mockery of the English language . This disease ( which was probably throat cancer ) had no reality for Sir Olin . He did not believe that other people were even conscious of his mispronunciations . At least once every term , to our irreverent delight and to Martin 's excruciating discomfort , he was invited to deliver before the whole school an informal address of a religious nature  --  or a pi-jaw as we called it . When I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to giggle , I used to watch my friend 's knuckles go white as his father , from the dais , urged us " laddies " to keep ourselves strong and pure and trust in the Mercy of God , or , as he pronounced it , the " Murky of Klock . " Sir Olin 's pious solicitude for his own beloved " laddie " expressed itself also in the written word . Every morning , more regular than the rising of the English sun , there lay on Martin 's breakfast plate the blue envelope with the Slater coatof-arms . Martin was a silent boy . He never spoke a word to hint that Sir Olin 's effusiveness was a torment to him , even when the derisive titter parodied down the table : " Another lecker for the ! icicle lackie . " But I noticed that he left these letters unopened unless his sensitive fingers , palpating the envelopes , could detect banknotes in them . Most of the other boys tended to despise Martin for the solecism of such a parent . My own intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not been for the hampers of " tuck " which Lady Slater sent from Olinscourt . Such tuck it was , too ? coming at a period when German submarines were tightening all English belts . Being a scrawny and perpetually hungry boy , I was never more prepared to be chummy with Martin Slater than when my roommate and I sneaked off alone together to tackle those succulent tongues , those jellied chickens , those firm , luscious peaches , and those chocolate cakes stiffened with mouth-melting icing . Martin shared my enthusiasm for these secret feasts , but he had another all-absorbing enthusiasm which I did not share . He was an inventor . He invented elaborate mechanical devices , usually from alarm clocks of which there were always five or six in his possession in different stages of disembowelment . He specialized at that period in burglar alarms . I can see now those seven or eight urchins that he used to lure into our room at night with sausage rolls and plum cake ; I can almost hear my own heart beating as we waited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for foiling housebreakers . These thrilling episodes ended summarily , however , when an unfeeling master caught us at it , confiscated all Martin 's clocks , and gave him a hundred lines for disturbing the peace . Without these forbidden delights , the long , blacked-out nights of wartime seemed even darker and colder . It was Martin who evolved a system whereby we could dispel the dreary chill which settled every evening on the institution like a miasma , and warm up our cold beds and our undernourished bodies . He invented wrestling  --  or rather , he adapted and simplified the canons of the art to suit the existing contingency . His rules were simple almost to the point of being non-existent . One took everypossible advantage ; one inflicted as much pain as one reasonably dared ; one was utterly unscrupulous toward the single end of making one 's opponent admit defeat with the phrase : " I give in , man . You win . " It did n't seem to do us much harm thus to work out on one another the sadism that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; perhaps in some subtle way it established in us an intimacy , a mutual respect . Though Martin had the advantage of me in age and weight , I was , luckily , more wiry and possibly craftier . As I gradually got on to Martin 's technic I began to develop successful counter measures . So successful were they , in fact , that I started to win almost nightly , ending up on top with monotonous regularity . And that was the first , the greatest mistake I ever made in my dealings with Martin Slater . I should have known that it is unwise to win too often at any game . It is especially unwise when one is playing it with a potential murderer , who , I suspect , had already conceived for any subjugation , moral or physical , a hatred that was almost psychopathological and growing in violence . I experienced its violence one night when , less scrupulous than Hamlet toward Claudius , he attacked me as I knelt shivering at my bedside going through the ritual of " saying my prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the specified safety hour and while the matron was still prowling . Also , though props and weapons were strictly inadmissible , he elected on this occasion to initiate his attack by throwing a wet towel over my head , twisting it round my neck as he pulled me backward . It was a very wet towel too , so wet that breathing through it was quite out of the question . With his initial , almost strangling jerk backward , my legs had shot forward , underneath the bed , where they could only kick feebly at the mattress springs , useless as leverage to shake off Martin , who had seated his full weight on my face , having pinioned my arms beneath his knees . I was a helpless prisoner with a wet towel and some hundred pounds of boy between me and any chance of respiration . Frantically I gurgled my complete submission . I beat my hands on the floor in token of surrender . But Martin sat relentlessly on . For a moment I knew the panic of near suffocation . I clawed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been buried a hundred feet under the earth . Then everything began to go black , including as I afterward learned , my own face . I was saved mercifully by the approach of the peripatetic matron who bustled in a few moments later and blew out the candle without being aware that one of her charges had almost become Martin Slater 's first victim in homicide . Martin apologized to me next morning but there was a strange expression on his face as he added : " You were getting too cocky , man , licking me every night . " His more practical appeasement took the form of inviting me to Olinscourt for the holidays . I weighed the disadvantages of four weeks under Sir Olin 's pious tutelage against the prospect of tapping the source of those ambrosial hampers . Inevitably , my schoolboy stomach decided for me . I went . To our delight , when we first arrived at Olinscourt we found Sir Olin away on an uplift tour of the reformatories and prisons of western England . He might not have existed for us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Martin 's breakfast plate . Lady Slater made an admirably unobtrusive hostess  --  a meek figure who trailed vaguely round in low-heeled shoes and snuff-colored garments which associate themselves in my mind with the word " gabardine . " Apart from ordering substantial meals for us " growing boys " and dampening them slightly by an aroma of piety , she kept herself discreetly out of our way in some meditative boudoir of her own . Left to our devices , Martin spent long days of feverish activity in his beautifully equipped workshop , releasing all the inventive impulses which had been frustrated at school and which , as he hinted apologetically , would be thwarted again on the return of Sir Olin . Being London bred , there was nothing I enjoyed more than wandering alone round the extensive grounds and farm lands of Olinscourt , ploddingly followed by a dour Scotch terrier called Roddy . The old rambling house was equally exciting , particularly since on the second day of my visit I discovered a chamber of mystery , a large locked room on the ground floor which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as intrigued as I by the closure of this room which was normally much used . Inquiries from the servants elicited only the fact that there had been alterations of an unknown nature and that the room had been ordered shut until Sir Olin 's return . This romantic mystery , which only Sir Olin could solve , made us almost look forward to the baronet 's return . He arrived unexpectedly some nights later and appeared in our room , oozing plump affection , while we were having our supper  --  Martin 's favorite meal and one he loved to spin out as long as possible . That evening , however , we were never to finish our luscious salmon mayonnaise . Ardent to resume his spiritual wrestling match with his beloved laddie , Sir Olin summarily dismissed our dishes and settled us down to a session known as " The Quiet Quarter , " which was to prove one of the most mortifying of our daily ordeals at Olinscourt . It started with a reading by Sir Olin from a book written and privately published by himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this one-sided " chat " was over Sir Olin sat back , hands folded over his ample stomach , and invited us with an intimate smile to tell him of our problems , our recent sins and temptations . We wriggled and squirmed a while trying to think up some suitable sin or temptation ; then the baro-518 IIARPER 'S MAGAZINE net relieved the situation by a long impromptu prayer , interrupted at last , thank heavens , by the downstairs booming of the dinner gong . Then , having laid benedictory hands on our heads , Sir Olin kissed us both  --  me on the forehead and Martin full on the mouth  --  and dismissed us to our beds . There , for the first time since my arrival at Olinscourt , Martin leaped on me with a sudden savagery far surpassing anything he had shown at school . With his fingers pressed against my windpipe , I was helpless almost immediately and more than ready to surrender . " Swear you wo n't tell the chaps at school about him kissing us good-night , " he demanded thickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nor about those pi-jaws he 's going to give us every evening . " It was not until I had given my solemn oath that he released me . Next morning it became immediately apparent that with Sir Olin 's return the golden days were over . With his return too Lady Slater had departed on some missionary journeyings of her own , a fact which suggested that she enjoyed her husband 's presence no more than we did . In the place of her short but fervent grace , Sir Olin treated us and the entire staff of servants to ten minutes of family prayers  --  all within sight and scent of the lemon glory of scrambled eggs , the glistening mahogany of sausage and kippers , which sizzled temptingly on the side table . But at least the baronet solved the mystery of the locked study , solved it quite dramatically too . Immediately after breakfast on his first day at home , he summoned us into the long , book-lined room and announced with a chuckle : " Lickle surprise for you , Martin , laddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We watched breathless as Sir Olin touched an invisible switch and smoothly , soundlessly , the bookcase swung out into the room , revealing behind it the dull metal of a heavy door . And in the center of this heavy door was a gleaming brass combination switch . " Oh , Father , it 's a secret safe ! " Martin 's face lighted up with enthusiasm . Sir Olin chuckled again and took out a heavy gold hunter watch . Opening the back of it as if to consult some combination number , he started to turn the brass knob to and fro . At length , as on oiled wheels , the heavy door rolled back , disclosing not a mere safe , but a square , vaultlike chamber with a small desk and innumerable drawers of different sizes , suggesting the more modern bank-deposit strong rooms . He invited us to enter and we obeyed , trembling with excitement . Sir Olin showed us some of the wonders , explaining as he did so that his object in withdrawing his more liquid assets from his London bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the destructive menace of German zeppelins . He twisted a knob and drew out a drawer glittering with golden sovereigns . He showed us other mysterious drawers containing all that was negotiable of the Slaters ' earthly treasure , labeled with such titles as " Mortgages , " " Insurance , " " Stocks and Shares , " " Treasury Notes , " etc. , etc . It suggested the romances of William LeQueux and the fantasies of H. G. Wells . Confronted by this elaborate manifestation of parental solicitude , Martin asked the question I had expected : " Has it got a burglar alarm , Father ? " " No . No . " Sir Olin 's plump fingers caressed his son 's hair indulgently . " Why do n't you try your hand at making one , laddie , in your spare time ? " I was soon to learn , however , that spare time was a very rare commodity with Sir Olin about . The baronet , a passionate English country gentleman himself , was determined to instill a similar enthusiasm in his only son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his workshop , was obliged to make the rounds of the estate with his father , following through barn and stable , over pasture and plowland , listening to an interminable monologue on how Sir Olin , the eleventh baronet , with the aid of God , was disposing everything perfectly for the twelfth baronet , the future Sir Martin Slater . I usually tagged along behind them with Sir Olin 's only admirer , the dour Roddy , staring entrancedly at the sleek flanks of cows whose cream would enrich next term 's tuck hampers ; at pigs whose very shape suggested sausage rolls of the future ; at poultry whose plumpness I translated dreamily into terms of drumsticks , second joints , and slices of firm white breast . Every day Sir Olin brought us back from our cross-country tramps at exactly five minutes to one , which left us barely time to wash our hands for lunch . And after lunch until tea , the baronet , eager to share Martin 's playful as well as his weighty moments , took us riding or bowled googly lobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to improve our batting style in a game that we both detested . Tea at four-thirty was followed by our only real period of respite . For at five o'clock , punctual as Sir Olin 's gold hunter , his estate agent arrived from Bridgewater , and the two of them were closeted together in the library until seven o'clock when the dressing gong sounded and Sir Olin put documents and ledgers into his strong room and the agent took his leave . Needless to say , Martin and I daily blessed the estate agent 's name , though it was , infelicitously enough , Ramsbotham . And , needless to say , his arrival was the signal for us to scoot off , me to my wanderings , Martin to his workshop , until suppertime . Suppertime itself , once the most blissful moment of the day , lost its glory ; for Sir Olin , unlike his wife , was quite indifferent to food . Eager for his " quiet quarter , " he allowed us a scant twelve minutes to feed the inner boy . His appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant removal of our plates , and many a succulent morsel did I see snatched from me . Martin loved good food as much as I did , butbeing a truer epicure than I , was incapable of gobbling . He frequently had to endure the " quiet quarter " and his father 's good-night kiss on an almost empty stomach . A few days later Sir Olin introduced yet another torture for Martin . The baronet decided that his son was now old enough to learn something about the business side of an estate that would one day be his . Three times a week , therefore , Martin was required to be present from five to seven o'clock in the library with his father and Ramsbotham . This left him only two hours on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays for tinkering in his beloved workshop . It meant also that , at least three times a week , his supper period was even further curtailed . I think it was about this time I began to notice a change in Martin . He became even more silent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . These , I suspect , were caused partly by the fact that he made up for the lost time in his workshop by sneaking out to it in the middle of the night . I say I suspect this , for he never took me into his confidence ; but on two occasions when I happened to wake after midnight his bed was empty and through the open window I could see a flickering light in the workshop . My guess is that the final stage really started on Saturday night at the end of my third week at Olinscourt . The dressing gong had just sounded and , as I happened to pass the library , I heard the tinkle of a bell . I was surprised , since the telephone there rang very seldom and usually only for something important . Martin , who had joined me on the stairs , voiced my unspoken hope . " Say , man , d' you think perhaps that 's someone calling Father away or something jolly like that ? " And later , as I was hurrying through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting , and from the window Martin announced excitedly : " There 's old Ramsbum 's car , and I do believe I see Father in it with him . He has n't come up to dress yet . Wait while I go down to the library to see . " He returned in a few minutes with the good news that his father , not being there , had presumably Ieft with Mr. Ramsbotham , which meant we could linger pleasantly over supper . It was a delicious supper too  --  fresh trout followed by raspberries and cream , and was brought up by no less a person than Pringle , the head butler . " Excuse me , Master Martin , " he said with an apologetic cough , " but do you happen to know if Sir Olin will be down to dinner ? " " I think he went to Bridgewater with Mr. Ramsbotham . " Martin 's mouth was full of green peas . " I know he was asked to give a talk at the boys ' reformatory there some Saturday . And someone rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , but he did n't mention it to me , sir . " Pringle withdrew in starchy disapproval and left us the pleasant realization that there would be no " quiet quarter " and no good-night kiss . And there were no family prayers next morning , since Sir Olin had not returned . It was to be presumed that he had been exhausted by reforming reformatory boys and had consequently spent the night in Bridgewater with Mr. Ramsbotham . And , as it was a Sunday , no question was raised as to his absence . Martin , bright-eyed , rushed off to his workshop immediately after breakfast and I decided on a stroll . It was then that happened one of those tiny incidents that seemed trivial at the time , but seen in later perspective , appear most significant . I had whistled for Roddy , usually so anxious to share my walks abroad , but no scampering feet answered my summons . I whistled again . Then I started to look for him , calling : " Hey , Roddy . . . rats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study at last solved the problem . Roddy had apparently found a rat of his own , for he was scratching at the central bookcase with a strange crooning sound . I induced him to follow me , but later when I turned to look back , he had vanished . And that , in itself , was quite unprecedented . Another seemingly unimportant incident occurred later that morning when I arrived home from my walk . The day was hot and I had taken off my school blazer before going out , hanging it on a peg in the hall , near the front door . When I got back a blazer was there , but it was hanging upside down . As I unhooked it a number of letters dropped from the pockets . They were from Sir Olin to his son and I realized at once that Martin had gone in to lunch ahead of me , taking my blazer by mistake . I picked up the letters all of them as I thought  --  shoved them back into the pockets and promptly forgot the whole thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coats . Next morning Martin did a rare thing . He got up before me and was at his place at the breakfast table when I came down . In front of him was an unopened letter and I immediately recognized the writing on the envelope as his father 's . As Pringle brought the coffee he said with his usual apologetic cough : " When I picked up the letters from the front hall , Master Martin , I took the liberty of observing there was one for you from Sir Olin . I was wondering if he mentions the date of his return . " " Just give me a sec , Pringle . " Martin heaped his plate with kedgeree . " I 'll read it and tell you . " After the dignified withdrawal of Pringle , Martin tore open the envelope and pulled out two pages of the familiar crabbed scrawl . He scanned the first page quickly , muttering : " Just the usual pi stuff . " " Does he say when he 's coming back ? " I asked . " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pringle 's footsteps sounded in the passage outside he handed me the first page and the envelope , saying urgently : " Here , shove those into the fire , man . I 'd die rather than have Pringle see all that religious slosh . " As I speedily thrust the first page of slosh , together with the envelope , into the fire , I heard Martin 's voice , studiedly casual for Pringle 's benefit : " Here , Pat , read this . You 're better at making out Father 's writing . " He passed me the second sheet and I read : And so , beloved lad , I shall be back with you in three or four days . In the meantime I pray that His Guidance ... etc. . . . etc ... . The letter contained no hint as to his actual whereabouts . We imparted the gist of this to Pringle and he seemed satisfied enough , though somewhat resentful that he had not been informed personally of his master 's absence . Still more resentful and far less satisfied was Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , he had not driven Sir Olin to Bridgewater or anywhere else . The talk at the reformatory had been definitely arranged for next Saturday . He had of course to accept the evidence of the letter which Martin duly presented but it was all very vexing . all very odd . It was more vexing and more odd when it came out that no one had driven Sir Olin to the station . I do n't know exactly when anyone became really alarmed at Sir Olin 's continued absence , but at some stage Mr. Ramsbotham must have telephoned Lady Slater to come home . Even before her return , however , I had put the missing baronet temporarily out of my mind and given myself up to thorough enjoyment of life without him . To the adult it may seem odd that , in view of the circumstances narrated , I myself felt no uneasiness as to Sir Olin 's safety . I can only say that a child 's mind is not a logical one ; that the events preceding the baronet 's disappearance had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I look back now and place each occurrence in its proper context that I can see the terrifying inevitability of the pattern that was forming . The next piece of news I heard was exciting . The need to pay the staff and the monthly bills had made it essential that the vault , containing among its other riches all the Slater ready cash , be opened . Since Sir Olin alone knew its combination , arrangements were finally made to bring from London the workmen who had built it and who were to blast through the complicated lock . We were warned to keep away during the period of the actual dynamite blast , but nothing could have kept me from the scene of operations . I lured a curiously reluctant Martin to join me , and we had hidden behind a couch in the dust-sheeted study by the time the men came in to set the fuse . Even now I am able to recapture those tense moments of waiting behind the couch . I can smell the musty smell of the heavy brocade ; I can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I can see his face pale and set ; I can hear the whispered words of the men as they set about their dangerous job . And then , sooner than I had expected , came the blast . It was terrific , rocking the study and , so it seemed , rocking the very foundations of Olinscourt . Martin and I bumped heads painfully as we jumped up , but I did not notice the pain . I was watching the stream of black smoke which poured from the door of the vault . Through it we heard : " That ought to have done the trick . Here , lend a hand . " Martin and I watched as the men started to swing back the heavy door of the vault . Pringle was hovering fussily behind them . I could see him through the clearing smoke . I was conscious again of Martin 's heavy breathing , of the inscrutable brown eyes staring fixedly at the door of the vault as it gradually opened . Then I heard a smothered exclamation from one of the men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room . Above it came Pringle 's voice : " Good God in Heaven , it 's Sir Olin ! " I saw it then  --  saw the body of a stout man slumped over the tiny desk inside the vault . I saw the dull gleam of a revolver in his hand , the purplish bloodstain above the right temple . I saw the men moving hesitatingly toward it to lift it up and then Pringle 's voice again , warningly : " Leave him for the police . He 's dead . Shot ' isself . " For a moment I stared at that slumped body with the fascination of a child who is seeing death for the first time . A vague odor invaded my nostrils . It was probably the odor of gunpowder , but to my childish mind it became the smell of death . I knew sudden , blinding terror . I pushed past Martin , running upstairs to the lavatory on the fourth floor . I was very sick . I do n't know how long I stayed there locked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that I had a wild desire to get home  --  to walk if necessary back to zeppelin-raided London  --  away from the horror of the thing that I had seen in the vault . I must have been there for hours . Someone was calling my name . I emerged from the lavatory rather sheepishly to see Pringle on the landing below . He said " Master Pat , you are wanted in Lady Slater 's dressing room . You and Master Martin . " I found Martin hovering outside his mother 's door . He looked as if he had been sick too . Lady Slater was sitting by the window in her boudoir . The snuff-colored gabardines had given place to funereal black , but there was no sign of grief or tears on her face . Even at that cruel moment it seemed beyond her scope to become human . Through a haze of pious phraseology she told us what I already knew  --  that Sir Olin had taken his own life . " The terrible disease in his throat . . . we do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in a letter to me . . . we must not judge him . . . " And then she was holding out a thick envelope to Martin . " He left a letter for you too , my son . " Martin took the envelope , and I could not help noticing that his fingers instinctively palpated it to discover the lurking presence of banknotes , just as he had always done at school . " And he left a parcel for you also . " Lady Slater handed Martin a square carefully wrapped package . Then she continued : " The inscription on it is the same as on the letter . They are for you alone , Martin , to open and do with as you think fit . " After this Lady Slater took us downstairs to the great living room . The village constable was standing by the door . A gentleman of military deportment was talking with Pringle , the butler , and Mr. Ramsbotham . A dim , drooping figure hovered at their side  --  the local doctor . From behind a bristling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of Sir Olin 's disappearance . Martin , surprisingly steady now , told our simple story . We had both thought we heard the telephone ringing in the library . Martin believed he had caught a glimpse of Sir Olin driving off with Mr. Ramsbotham . He assumed that his father had gone to give his lecture at the reformatory . Monday morning there had been a letter from Sir Olin on Martin 's plate telling him that he would not return for several days . The problem of that letter which had lulled everyone into a false sense of security was next considered . The mustache pointed out that it must have been one which Sir Olin had written to his son at some earlier date and which , by accident , had become confused with the morning post on the front-door mat . It was at this moment that I remembered how , in my hurry for lunch on the day after Sir Olin 's disappearance , I had snatched at the blazer which had been hanging in the hall . I remembered how the unopened letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the conviction of sin known only to children , I saw the whole tragedy as my own fault . And , with more confusion than courage , I was stammering out my guilty secret . Martin , watching me steadily , was able to corroborate my story , admitting with an awkward flush that he had not always opened his father 's letters the moment they arrived . The military eyebrows were raised a trifle and there the matter of the letter stood . " Martin 's little friend " had spilled some old unopened letters from Sir Olin out of Martin 's blazer ; he had failed to pick one of them up ; next morning the butler had found it on the door mat and supposed it to be part of the regular morning post . . . . A most unfortunate accident . The military gentleman then turned to Lady Slater ; " There is one thing , Lady Slater . Sir Olin went into the vault on Saturday evening and he was never seen again . It is to be presumed that he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heavy door from the inside even if lie had wished to . " Martin was watching the brisk mustache now , his eyes very bright . " And yet , Lady Slater , Doctor Webb here tells me that your husband has actually been dead for less than twenty-four hours . To-day is Thursday . This means that Sir Olin shot himself through the temple sometime yesterday . In other words he must have spent the three previous days alive in the vault . " He cleared his throat . " From this letter to you there is no question but that your husband took his own life , but I am wondering if you could  --  er offer an explanation as to why he should have delayed so long  --  why he should have spent that uncomfortably long period in the vault . Why he should have waited until the oxygen must have been almost exhausted , why he should . . . " " He had letters to write . Last bequests to make . " Lady Slater 's eyes blinked . She seemed determined to reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . " He wanted to make the final arrangements just right . " Her voice sank to a whisper . " Such things take time . " " Time . Yes . " The military gentleman gave almost an invisible shrug . " But not the better part of three days , Lady Slater . " " I think , " replied Lady Slater , and with these words she seemed to lift the whole proceedings to a higher plane , " I think that Sir Olin probably spent the greater part of his last three days in  --  in prayer . " And indeed there was no answer to that . We were dismissed almost immediately . In his mother 's dressing room Martin carefully picked up the letter and the package which had been left for him by Sir Olin . He moved ahead of me toward the door . Now that the ordeal was over I felt the need of human companionship , but Martin seemed eager to get away from everyone . Keeping a discreet distance , I followed him out into the sunlit afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him and leaving me with my face pressed dolefully against the window . I do n't think he was conscious of me , but I had no intention of spying on him . The loneliness of death was still with me and contact , however remote , with Martin was a comfort . As I watched , he put the letter down on his work bench . Then , casually , he started to unpack the parcel . I was surprised to see that it was nothing more than an alarm clock , an ordinary alarm clock similar to the dozen or so that already stood on the workshop shelf , except for the fact that it seemed to have attached to it some sort of wire contrivance . I have a dim memory of thinking it odd that his father 's last tangible bequest should be anything so meager , so commonplace as an alarm clock . Martin hardly looked at the clock . He merely put it on the shelf with the others . Then he lighted one of the Bunsen burners with which his well-stocked workshop was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written him , the last of those many letters which he had received and which he had neglected to read . He did not even glance at the envelope . He thrust it quickly into the jet from the Bunsen burner and held it there until the flames must almost have scorched his fingers . Then , very carefully , Sir Martin Slater , twelfth baronet , collected the ashes and threw them into the wastepaper basket . I remained at Olinscourt for the funeral . Of the service itself I have only the shadowiest and most childish memories . Not so dim , however , are my recollections of the funeral baked meats . am ashamed to say that I gorged myself . I have no doubt that Martin did so too . The next day it was decided by my family that I should leave the Slaters alone to their grief . My reluctant departure was sweetened by a walnut cake left over from the funeral which I packed tenderly and stickily at the bottom of my portmanteau . I never saw Martin Slater again . For some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had shivered and wrestled together and go straight to Harrow . For a while I missed the hampers from Olinscourt , but soon the War was over and my family moved to America . I forgot all about my old chum . Not long ago a mood of nostalgia brought me to thinking of my childhood and Martin Slater again . Slowly , uncovering a fragment here , a fragment there , I found that I was able to restore this long-obliterated picture of my visit at Olinscourt . The facts of course had been in my mind all the time . All they had lacked was interpretation . Now , thanks to a more adult and detached eye , I can see as a whole something which , to my childish view , was nothing more than a disconnected sequence of happenings . Perhaps I am doing an old school friend an atrocious wrong ; perhaps I am cynically forcing a pattern on to what was , in fact , nothing more than a complex of unfortunate accidents and fantastic coincidences . But I am inclined to think otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more clearly now than when we were children together . i see a boy , teetering on the unstable brink of puberty , who revolted passionately from any physical or spiritual intrusion into his privacy ; a boy of intense pride and fastidiousness who was mature enough to know he must fight to maintain his personal independence , yet not mature enough to have learned that in the wrestling match of life certain holds are barred  --  the death-lock , for example . I see that boy stifled by the sincere but nauseating affection of a father who bombarded him with assiduous pieties that made him the laughingstock of his schoolfellows ; of a father who , with his " quiet quarters , " his sermonizings , his full-mouthed good-night kisses , turned Martin 's home life into an incessant siege upon the sacred citadel of his privacy . I am sure that Martin 's hatred of his father was something deeply ingrained in him which grew as he grew toward adolescence . That hatred was kept in check perhaps so long as the undeclared war of love was waged unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Olinscourt . For I represented the outside world , and in front of me Sir Olin stripped his son naked of all the decent reserves . Those kisses on the mouth were , I believe , to Martin the kisses of Judas . Sir Olin had betrayed him forever . And Martin Slater was too young to know any other punishment for betrayal than  --  death . The details of that crime speak , I think , plainly enough for themselves . During one of his nightly absences from our bedroom Martin could easily have stolen into his sleeping father 's room and studied the combination of the safe in the back of the gold hunter . He could easily have slipped into the vault on the night before the crime and installed there PORTR some ingenious product of his workshop , some device , manufactured from an alarm clock and set for the hour at which Sir Olin invariably entered the vault , which would either automatically have shut the heavy steel door behind the baronet or have distracted his attention long enough for Martin to close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than adequate to have created that last and most successful " burglar alarm , " just as his conversation with his father about installing the alarm , as witnessed by myself , would have provided an innocent explanation for the contrivance if it had been discovered later in the vault with Sir Olin . From then on , with me as an unconscious and carefully exploited accessory , the rest must have been simple too an invented glimpse of Sir Olin driving off in Mr. Ramsbotham 's car , the clever trick of the old letter , steamed open probably and checked for content , planted among the morning post to put Pringle 's mind at rest about his master 's absence and to make certain that Sir Olin would not be searched for until it was too late . There was genuine artistry in Martin 's use of me to cover his tracks . For it was I who innocently burned the first page and the envelope of that fatal letter whose date and postmark would otherwise have proved it to have been of earlier origin . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was held responsible for that letter 's having dropped " inadvertently " into the morning mail . Yes , Martin Slater , at fourteen , showed a shrewd and native talent for murder . And , as a murderer , he must be considered an unqualified success . For he never even came under suspicion . There was one person , however , who must have been only too conscious of Martin Slater 's dreadful deed . And in that , to me , lies the real horror of thestory . I try to keep myself from thinking of Sir Olin bustling into his safe to put away his papers as usual ; Sir Olin hearing a little ting-a-ling like the whirring bell of an alarm clock ; Sir Olin spinning round to see the great door of the safe closing behind him , shutting him into that sound-proof vault ; and somewhere , probably above the door , a curious amateur device composed of a clock and some lengths of wire . I try not to think of the nightmare days that must have followed for him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recognized as the lethal invention of his own son ; days spent hoping against hope that Martin would relent and release him from that chamber where the oxygen was growing suffocatingly scarcer ; days spent contemplating the terrible culmination of his " perfect " relationship with his beloved laddie . I wonder if , during those hours of horror , Sir Olin Slater 's evangelical faith in the intrinsic goodness of human nature ever faltered . Somehow I doubt it . His heroic manner of death gives me the clue . For Sir Olin , however frightfully he had mismanaged his life , made a triumphant success of death . I can see him , weakened with hunger and thirst , scarcely able to breathe ; I can see him neatly , almost meticulously , wrapping up the telltale alarm clock which , if left to be discovered , might have pointed to Martin 's complicity . I can see him writing a pious " suicide " note to his wife , and that other probably forgiving note , which was never to be read , to his son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those brass-handled drawers in the wall of the vault  --  and gallantly taking his own life in order to shield his son 's immense crime from detection . Indeed , it may well be said of Sir Olin that nothing in his life became him like the leaving it .
