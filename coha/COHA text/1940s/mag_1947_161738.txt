On the flatlands of China 's Honan Province , near Chengchow , a tiny rivulet of muddy water oozed into a dried-up channel and meandered sluggishly toward Pohai Gulf , some 400 miles to the northeast . The rivulet , a man-made branch of the Yellow River , was the first fruit of the giant flood-control effort to thrust " China 's Sorrow " back into its pre-1938 bed . In Shanghai , UNRRA Engineer Oliver J. Todd , director of the project ( TIME , June 17 ) , contemplated news of the trickle with mixed emotions . " Todd Almighty " knew that this was no dream come true ; in fact , a nightmare was just beginning . <P> For his project Todd last summer had won the cooperation of Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists . But last week the Communists were demanding a five-month postponement of further work on the river . In Yenan , Communist Spokesman Chou En-lai gave the official Communist reason : " It would destroy the lives and property of several million people " living in the path of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these millions had been delayed by the Nationalists ' failure to make good a promised $15 billion CN ( $4.5 million U.S. ) relief payment to local Communist authorities . <P> The Nationalists retorted that the Communists intended to seize the fund for their party treasury , paying the displaced peasants in depreciated Communist currency and using the profit to buy arms . But the Nanking Government was so anxious to keep the Yellow River project alive that it offered to send a $5 billion down payment by UNRRA courier. * <P> This offering might undermine the Communists ' formal objection to the project ; but their real fear was that the revised river course would sever their armies in Honan and Shantung Provinces . They warned UNRRA that if work continued they would " feel free to take whatever action they deem necessary " - which obviously did not mean a lawsuit . <P> By March , Todd 's Nationalist peasant workers could dump enough rock-fill into the new dikes to hold the diverted river 's flow . If work stopped , however , Todd 's uncompleted dikes might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and wondered which was worse : to risk disastrous floods by " China 's Sorrow " or to risk hurting the Communist military position and thus sully UNRRA 's spotless record of neutrality . <P> <P> * The courier would have his hands full ; in $2,000 Chinese bills , the payment would take up six cubic yards , equivalent in baggage bulk to two cords of kindling wood .
