Monks of Athos <P> Sirs : May I have your permission to utter a protest against the article on Mount Athos which was published in your issue of April 28 ? . . . <P> The statement about the morality of the monks is a gross and wicked exaggeration of facts which are regretted by the monks , themselves , more than by anyone else . It is , of course , quite true that wherever you get a number of men-many of them young-segregated from the rest of the world , the evils spoken of by your correspondent invariably arise . The same thing might be said of many schools and colleges in all countries . . . . <P> I and others who have enjoyed the hospitality of the monks can feel nothing but disgust for a writer who anonymously criticizes a body of men whose guest he has been , and I am amazed that you should have published so irresponsible and sensational a report . <P> KIRSOPP LAKE <P> Haverford , Pa . <P> &gt; TIME 'S account of the decline in morality among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggeration , but based on very careful research . TIME consulted reliable authorities for its information , but since Dr. Lake is a famed theologian who has visited the monks , it is evident that authorities now disagree . - ED . <P> Negative Nose <P> Sirs : <P> May I object to one adjective in the repertoire of your Music Department ? In your July 7 issue I am described as " beaky . " This error seems to be part of a tradition developed by several caricaturists . Peggy Bacon , in her book of drawings , Off with Their Heads , called my nose " positive " but her picture does not emphasize its aquiline character . In fact , I have been told that my nose is too small for my face , and I am thinking seriously of having it lifted at the bridge . <P> I am a great admirer and constant reader of the TIME vocabulary . You may call me paunchy , chesty , necky , cheeky , eary , browy , even mouthy , but not " beaky . " <P> SIGMUND SPAETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> MANY THANKS FOR THE FLATTERING REFERENCE TO MY GAUDILY CROWNED HEAD IN TIME FOR JULY 7 BUT MAY I FILE A GENTLE DEMURRER TO YOUR REPEATED USE OF THE ADJECTIVE " DWARFISH " IN DESCRIBING MY PERSON . ALTHOUGH I ACTUALLY STAND FIVE FEET FOUR INCHES IN SOCKS , I HAVE NEVER OBJECTED TO BEING RIBBED ABOUT MY SIZE . YOUR PET WORD , HOWEVER , STRIKES ME AS INAPPROPRIATE AS IT CARRIES A CONNOTATION OF THE MONSTROUS AND STUNTED . LET ME SUGGEST THAT SUCH PHRASES AS " SMALLISH , " " MINUTE , " " MINIATURE " AND EVEN " POCKET-SIZE " BILLY ROSE WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE APPETIZING . OF COURSE , IF YOUR MIND IS MADE UP , I ASSURE YOU THAT I WOULD RATHER BE LABELED " DWARFISH " THAN NOT BE MENTIONED IN YOUR SPLENDID MAGAZINE AT ALL . KINDEST REGARDS . <P> BILLY ROSE <P> New York City <P> Swope Misplaced <P> Sirs : <P> TIME , July 7 , says , in the Theater Department : " Among the backers who shared the rumored $85,000 " was I. <P> The story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> I was not a backer of the enterprise . I lost no money in it , directly or indirectly . I do not even know Mr. Proser . . . . <P> HERBERT BAYARD SWOPE <P> New York City <P> &gt; TIME was misinformed , erroneously placed Mr. Swope , also John Hertz , among Proser 's backers. - ED.
