Despite the fact that he could hand-pick his subordinates , Spruille Braden faced a dilemma . Last week an old hand at Latin American affairs put his finger on it . Wrote onetime Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles in his New York Herald Tribune column : " For over two years I have warned that the policy of the Department of State would arouse popular support for the military leaders and weaken Argentina 's liberal and democratic forces . This policy helped to bring about Peron 's triumph . " <P> To those who insisted that the State Department " has been battling for a lofty principle , " Welles replied : " In so far as principles are involved , the policy of the State Department has deliberately violated principles to which this Government is solemnly pledged , including the spirit of the basic inter-American agreements . . . . It has circularized the other American republics announcing that it will participate in no inter-American agreements in which the new Argentine Government takes part . " Unless the U.S. takes Argentina back into its good graces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risking . . . the total destruction of Pan-American solidarity . " <P> Mr. Welles was seconded by Brazil . Good Neighbor Brazil doubted that " Nazi-Fascist doctrines , beaten at the seat of their irradiation , can encounter in the Western Hemisphere a propitious climate for new and dangerous adventures . . . . " Brazil , leading a majority of Latin American nations , was ready to let Argentina 's bygones be bygones . <P> This week the State Department tried to get out of its dilemma . Secretary of State James Byrnes , saying he spoke for a majority of the American republics , offered to include Argentina in the pact as soon as Peron wiped out the " Axis influences " in his country . We wanted " deeds and not merely promises , " huffed Jimmy Byrnes.
