Should science be on the defensive , remorseful for having made the Bomb ? Among those who think not is quick-smiling , quick-thinking Dr. James Bryant Conant , Harvard 's eminent chemist-president , and a top U.S. wartime scientist . Last week , Dr. Conant held a press conference in Manhattan to launch his just-published book , On Understanding Science. * <P> " Science , " Dr. Conant says with conviction , " is on the offensive and extending into new fields . From all sides we feel a demand for more understanding of science , and of what it can do for humanity . " <P> The new book , though physically small , is no light reading for summer afternoons . It is mostly a series of lectures ( delivered at Yale ) on teaching science to undergraduates who do not intend to become professional scientists . Dr. Conant 's idea : illustrate the " scientific method " by citing historical cases in which science has solved tough problems . Science , he believes , can not be a mere bulk of static knowledge , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> And where is it moving ? Nearly all scientific progress thus far , says Dr. Conant , has been in the " natural sciences " - those concerned with man 's environment , rather than with man himself . The " social sciences " ( everything from psychology to history ) have certainly not given man much help in keeping up with the flood of revolutionary knowledge and techniques developed by the natural sciences . Science 's next broad campaign may be to develop the social sciences to the point where they do some good . <P> Without attempting to minimize the Bomb , Dr. Conant believes that science itself holds the answer . " If ... we think of the potential power of destruction of the atomic bomb as the price we pay for health and comfort and aids to learning in this scientific age , we can perhaps more coolly face the task of making the best of an inevitable bargain , however hard . . . . We can begin to walk boldly along the tightrope of the atomic age .
