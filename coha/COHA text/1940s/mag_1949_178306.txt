When the Taft-Hartley Act banned the closed shop from union contracts , the International Typographical Union figured out a simple dodge . The printers refused to renew their contracts , but insisted that publishers agree instead to informal " conditions of employment " which actually kept the closed shop in operation . Many newspapers agreed ; the Chicago publishers refused , and the I.T.U. struck . To test the legality of the printers ' policy , the American Newspaper Publishers Association and the Chicago Newspaper Publishers Association filed separate suits against the I.T.U. before the National Labor Relations Board . Last week , six weeks after the Chicago publishers had won the strike ( TIME , Sept. 26 ) , the NLRB unanimously ruled that the " conditions of employment " were illegal . They were , said the board , a " bargaining strategy ... to effect the exclusion of non-union men , squarely in conflict with the Taft-Hartley Act . " The board ordered the union to stop discriminating against non-union men , and bargain in good faith .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
