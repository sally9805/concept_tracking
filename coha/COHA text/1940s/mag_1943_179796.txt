Of the millions of men who have been processed by Selective Service machinery throughout the nation only 6,277 by last week had been finally classified as conscientious objectors ( 4-E ) . Most were in labor camps working on soil conservation , reclamation and reforestation projects formerly in the CCC domain . Housed in 59 camps from coast to coast , C.O.s are under Army jurisdiction , do all their own work , pay their own upkeep or are supported by funds from churches and sympathizers . <P> Classed as objectors willing to accept noncombatant duties ( 1-A-O ) - ambulance drivers , stretcher-bearers , etc. - were 6,577 others . ( Most famous 1-A-O : Cinemactor Lew Ayres . ) In prison for draft-law violations were between 1,000 and 1,300 avowed conscientious objectors , half of them members of Jehovah 's Witnesses , whose claims did not get draft-board recognition . <P> Though the total of these three groups , about 14,000 , seemed minute compared to the millions of draft registrants , actually their number far exceeded the conscientious objectors of World War I. Then 3,989 C.O.s were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> World War II 's U.S. total is far below that of Britain , which has 50,000 conchies . One probable reason for this seemingly inverse showing between a nation long at battle and a nation new to the war : many U.S. conchies had other reasons for deferment ( e.g. , dependents , occupation , mental , moral or physical disability ) so are not listed as 4-E.
