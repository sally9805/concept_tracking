From the Nile Delta last week Archeologist Pierre Montet sent word he had found the tomb of King Psousennes I. The discovery caused crows of delight from Egyptologists , because up to last week no royal tomb of the 21st Dynasty had been located . <P> About ten centuries before Christ , Egypt 's Rameses III conquered in sea battle a coalition of Trojans , Achaeans and Philistines . The better to exploit her new-won sea power , Egypt moved her capital from Thebes , 400 miles up river , to Tanis , 60 miles from modern Alexandria , close to the sea but not too close to suffer from pirates . The religious capital remained at Thebes , ruled by Amon 's high priests . Smendes , sprig of a rich merchant family , founded the 21st ( Tanis ) Dynasty . His successor , Psousennes I , reigned 46 years . <P> Last year at Tanis , Professor Montet discovered a tomb which was first ascribed to Psousennes , but later turned out to be that of Sheshonk I , a 22nd Dynasty king who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shishak , as the pillager of Solomon 's treasures ( TIME , April 3 ; April 24 ) . <P> In the wall of Sheshonk 's tomb was a huge block of pink granite . Professor Montet , who has directed digs at Tanis since 1929 and discovered ( at Byblos ) the oldest known alphabetical inscription , is no mean archeologist . He suspected that behind that block was a passageway leading to the tomb of Psousennes . He was right . <P> Psousennes ' pink granite funerary chamber is rectangular , 23 by 10 ft . The big granite sarcophagus , carved on the sides in bas-relief , has a cover depicting the king as the god Osiris , supine , with a goddess kneeling behind him and stretching protective arms over his head . The sarcophagus contained a silver mummy case . Before opening this , the professor decided to await the arrival of King Farouk , an enthusiastic amateur . <P> On the floor of the chamber were four gold vases , with covers in the form of human heads ornamented by blue and gold wigs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-necked bottle , a ewer , a spouted jug , a number of cups-all gold . Near the door was the skeleton of a small animal , apparently a dog .
