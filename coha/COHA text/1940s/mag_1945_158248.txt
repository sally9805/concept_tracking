In Lublin last fortnight the Polish Committee of National Liberation announced that henceforth it was the Provisional Government of Poland . Five days later the Kremlin officially recognized it . <P> Instantly from London and Washington came cries of dissent . Said London : Russia 's action in no way affected the policy of His Majesty 's Government toward the Polish Government in Exile . Washington reaffirmed its recognition of the London Poles . <P> Russia 's puppetizing of Poland also drew protests from the U.S. and British press and liberals-but nothing like the hubbub they made when Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to preserve order in Greece . Liberal opinion was less concerned with the fate of the Poles than with the effect of Stalin 's move on the Grand Alliance , the war and a future world security organization . <P> Grim Correctness . In this , whatever their motives , they were probably somewhat more realistic than the Allied governments . Stalin 's intentions had been perfectly clear for months . He had high-pressured the London Poles , in the person of ex-Premier Stanislaw Mikolajczyk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had informed his Teheran colleagues of his decision to establish a friendly regime in Poland . When they asked him to wait a little while , he had graciously acceded . But he had never changed his plans . <P> Nor was there any group that could make him do so . The power of the London Poles ' fighting forces was destroyed by the Germans during the uprising in Warsaw ( which is now on the verge of famine- ) . The Polish Army fighting in Italy was loyal to the Government in Exile , but Italy is far from Poland . Last fortnight , while the Poles abroad planned to raise a memorial to 8,000 Polish soldiers who had died at Cassino , Lublin 's new Army , some 250,000 strong , were equipped with U.S. trucks which had been lend-leased to Russia . Said the Lublin Government 's President Boleslaw Berut to TIME Correspondent John Hersey : Lublin 's Army is " already larger than the French Army . It is growing all the time . . <P> " Enemy of the People . " The once-powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land policy has already split up many of their estates among the peasants . The landlords have gone into local administrative posts ( when they played ball with Lublin ) , or gone to jail ( when they did not ) . In London the Government in Exile was powerless . Premier Tomasz Arciszewski could merely growl : " We refuse to become a new Soviet Republic even under the name of ' independent Poland . ' " Ex-Premier Mikolajczyk was already being denounced by Lublin as a " traitor to the Polish peasants " -a new version of the " enemy of the people , " the formula that Russia uses to indict Nazis and collaborators . Perhaps Britain believed that Mikolajczyk could still participate in the Lublin Government , thus effecting a compromise between the Polish factions . But Lublin 's President Berut and Premier Edward Osubka-Morawski were publicly committed to keeping Mikolajczyk out of their Government .
