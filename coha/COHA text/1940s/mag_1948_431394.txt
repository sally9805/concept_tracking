 | A gentleman of my acquaintance , who is in the fourth grade , started a train of recollection in me not so long ago by asking if I would save for him the lump-sugar envelopes used by many hotels , dining cars , night clubs , and other eating places . These frills disappeared during the war , shortly after lamb chops were stripped of their paper rompers , but my friend says they have returned . He is collecting them . I had not heard of that item . I have come to know the predatory glitter that comes into a boy 's eye when he sees a match cover not in his collection , and long since learned to save for a young collector the stamps from @#  | any foreign mail that comes my way but I never before knew a boy whc collected kimonos for lump sugar .

Everyone who took off in July for two weeks at the shore or in the mountains showered the loved ones at home with gaudy post cards assuring them he was having wonderful time , sleeping under blankets every night , and wished you ere here . Humor ran high on these st cards , and sometimes low . The st - card manufacturers maintained ables of wits who did nothing but ink up comical cracks . The cracks in rn were a challenge to the wit of the cationist , who in his inscriptions tried outdo the professional wits . Thus , no ag worthy of the name who visited ' ashington ever sent a view of the " bite House back home without markg an upstairs window with a cross d writing , " X " marks my room .

Some of my friends went in for stamp collecting , that perennial favorite of boys , kings , and presidents , though I do not recall that any of us went for another favorite , birds ' eggs . But marbles ! Now you 're talking . Breathes there the man with soul so dead who as a kid never collected miggles , agates ( burnt , blue , or stony ) , reels , shooters , swirls , and those other iridescent beau-ties ?

Autograph collecting , as it is waged today , did not exist when I was a boy soprano . Many youngsters possessed autograph albums and wrote timidly to celebrities to bespeak their signatures for it , but most of the entries were likely to be lyric tributes from relatives and schoolmates , sentimentally ringing the changes on the roses-are-red motif . No such mayhem existed as is practised today by those shrill little girls and boys who hound the Hollywood gods and goddesses whenever they descend to earth . Nightly , in August in the 1900 's , our set hung on the fence about the entrance to Canfield 's Casino in Saratoga and watched Diamond Jim Brady , Reggie Vanderbilt , Tod Sloan , Lillian Russell , and the other glittering great descend from their carriages ? or their Wintons or Stanley Steamers ? and enter the palace . But it never occurred to us to try to fling these luminaries to the ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , we probably would have lost the battle . Celebrities were of tougher fiber in those days . I imagine that even Lillian Russell , a robust lady of ample architecture , could have wrestled any two of us , catch-as-catch-can , and gained the decision . THE collecting urge varied with the taste of the individual . It manifested itself in odd ways One friend I grilled in the course of my research for this thesis said he had collected bottle caps . and another had collected snakes ? I forgot to ask him whether dead or alive . Little girls collected dolls . Sea shells were favored , if you did not live at the seashore , in which case they were rather less than a treat . Young ladies made sentimental collections of pressec flowers and also collected , or kept , their theatre and dance programs .
