txt A survey of 216 war plants in the Boston area has disclosed that a rapid return of women to their homes and out of the labor market has already begun . According to the United States Employment Service here , which sponsored the survey , the decrease began about November , 1943 , but was almost imperceptible at first . In all , 9,100 women have been lost to the 216 plants . questioned , tut 1,1000 of these women left during the period April to May this year . An illuminating instance has occurred at Bethlehem-Hingham Shipbuilding Corporation , where within the past few weeks the completion of government con- , tracts has meant the laying off of as many as 500 workers a week . Interviewers who travel to the Hingham shipyards each Friday to persuade the workers to sign up at once for other jobs are finding that a lot of the women are not interested . " They went to work in the first place to do a specific job for the duration . " said Fred J. Therrien . Quincy Manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant is closing makes them figure they have accomplished their purpose and are free to go home . " When a woman worker has made up her mind to stop working , she stops working , Mr. Therrien . remarked . " Women are peculiar that way , " he said . Job inquiries from women at local U. S. E. S. offices hereabouts were 23 per cent fewer in May than in April , the War Manpower Commission reports . Not only the heavy industries are losing women workers , but in wholesale and retail trade and in banking and insurance and other " office " jobs there has been an over-all decrease April to May . The WMC concludes that this reflects a definite decline in the employment of women . Whether this condition is repeated throughout the country is ' a question . The Congress of Industrial Organizations thinks the percentage of women workers who will get out of industry perma- nently is small , about 15 per cent of those employed in war plants as of May , 1944 . A survey showed that virtually all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the married women would remain in heavy industry if the jobs were available . Half the women who has never had factory jobs before the war said they would like to continue in shop work . However , the New York State Division of Women , Child Labor , and Minimum Wage visited 304 war plants in the Empire State and found " a clear tendency on the part of employers to lay off women workers first as war contracts are terminated and to favor the re-employment of men . " The survey further reported that " 91 plants , employing 40 per cent of the total number of women in the survey , stated that their postwar plans provide for the replacement of women workers by men , . ? . even where the women have proved their ability during the war . " In October , 1939 , there were only 2.268,000 women employed in manufacture in the United States ; in 1943 the number had increased to 4,413.000 . It is apparently on the way down again . though observers think it will never drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
