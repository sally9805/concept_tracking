txt Interest Rate Considered Abnormal HARRY W. HARRISON . Letters to The Times Interest Rate Considered Abnormal To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial " One Way to Fight Inflation " might well have been one of the President 's ten recommendations , none of which cures the cause . The Federal Reserve System provided for an elastic money medium based on commercial paper outstanding , but to provide lower rates for Government financing during the war period these restrictions were changed and a fictitiously low discount rate was established . The war is over , and with a balanced budget it would seem that there would be no necessity for further financing , and while a rise in interest rates would depress long-term Governments , mostly ? held by institutions , this would be offset in large part , or wholly , by a better return on money at interest , so that the loss would be offset in a few years , and no loss if held to maturity . Short-term Government , financing would cost more , but if the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rise in interest rates , and decrease the money in circulation from about $1,250 per man , woman , and chili as compared with , say , $600 in 1942 , then we would have begun to roll back the inflationary advance . Anything that is abnormal can not be considered healthy , and the interest rate is certainly abnormal and the cause of the unhealthy symptoms , so why persist in an unhealthy atmos. uhere ?
