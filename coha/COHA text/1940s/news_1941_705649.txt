txt Automobile plants are highly specialized mechanisms designed to mass produce automobile* . Any defense program planner who expects these plants to masa produce munitions with the greatest of ease and efficiency is destined to disappointment . This is the composite opinion of the men who run the industry , many of whom helped to build it up to its present skill and specialization . They know what It can do , and they do n't put much stock in the argument that , if automobile output is curtailed further , the resultant idle machinery can make munitions . Auto Industry and Defense This is the fourth of a series of articles on the problems , troubles and triumphs of the automobile makers , a typical peace industry called upon to become a focal point of the defense program . In fact , some of the more blunt-spoken men in the industry , when told of talk about converting automobile plants into arsenals , speak acidulously of planners " who only warm chairs , have never been in factory and do n't know ja . die from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change A cursory check-up on the War Department 's industrial mobilization plan , prepared over 20 years on the basis of actual plant surveys , seems to bear out what the leaders of the industry say . The Industrial mobilization plan evidently did not count on the automobile industry for even as much materiel as it is already producing . One big company , for instance , says that the industrial mobilization plan contemplated that itsplants would make only shells and fuses . It has had only . one - small - shell order , : but meanwhile ; in new and especially equipped plants , this company is undertaking production at a wide array or bigger , more important munitions . The other companies tell a similar story . The industrial mobilization plan evidently contemplates only very limited use of the motor industry 's existing plants . Instead of being given this limited work , the industry has been asked to turn its energies to the production of more important munitions in newly-equipped munitions plants . To date , the defense program has been using the industry s " know how " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of people here , is as it should be . Three Types of Equipment The automobile industry , one top executive explains , has roughly three types of equipment . These types , in descending order of size . are : Special purpose machinery , general purpose equipment and tool and die-making machines . The special purpose machinery includes the strictly assembly plants and the specially-designed tools spotted throughout the industry . Generally spe.tring , there is no known defense work to which this machinery can be adapted . It is designed and intended to build cars , and it wo n't do anything else . " The P ? plant , " one man explained , " is a machine for turning out P ? cars . It is n't a foundry or a bunch of boring mills or a machine shop . It 's a specially designed machine for turning out out cars , and it wo n't do much of anything else . " Raving no defense work which they can do , these special-purpose plants might have to close down  --  with no net gain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80% of the current year 's level , members of the industry say . Operating at 80% of this year 's volume , the industry can spread its work over most of these plants , but after a plant has been slowed down so far , it becomes an uneconomic producer . must be closed and the remaining work concentrated in another plant . That is why further curtailment of production may close some of these plants and leave them idle . The second type of machinery in the Indus try is general purpose machinery . Soinetirnes it is concentrated in integrated units . such as foundries and forge shops . Sometimes it is standard machine tools , such as screw machines or planers , which are spotted along the production lines in their proper places . This equipment can be used on defense work if tasks which it can perform can be found . It is n't flexible , it ca n't fit itself to the work , the work must fit it . Much of It already is being used on defense work . Cadillac 's heat treatment facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft engine . Individual Type Not Adjustable Individual general purpose machine tools , however , can not be used efficiently or cheaply for defense work . Usually they are scattered in a manner which makes sense in the production of automobiles but makes little sense for anything else . Men in the industry say that their use on any other kind of work would be inefficient , highcost and more disruptive than productive . The third class of machinery in the industry is tool and die making machines . These are the great , flexible , multi-purpose machines . They normally work on making other machine tools , jigs , dies or fixtures . They can be adapted to an amazing array of work . They are already busy on defense orders . In its Fisher plapt No. 23 here General Motors has what it claims is the biggest single tool and die plant in the world . It already is working on Diesel engines , ordnance and airplane patterns . It is doing more defense work than it is tool making for the automobile industry , and this summer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and die making equipment is a relatively small part of the motor industry 's total plant . A top executive estimated roughly that 50% of his company 's equipment is special purpose , unadaptable machinery , that 35% is general purpose machinery for which some defense use fright be found , and that only 15% is flexible tool and die making machinery . As an official of another corporation pointed out , a 50% curtailment in automobile production would n't mean that 50% of the industry 's facilities can go to work ois armament . New Machines for Defense Work The defense work now being done or being prepared for in the Detroit area is on new machines ? in many cases on specially designed equipment . Much of the defense work involves boring or shaping metals  --  armorplate. for Instance  --  which are much harder than the automobile industry is equipped to handle . Also the work must be done to a fineness for which the industry is n't normally tooled . The opening in the armor plate of the Chrysler tank in which its 75 m. gun is mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysler tank arsenal , the Ford plant for making Pratt Sr Whitney engines , the Packard plant for making Rolls Royce engines , the Cadillac division for machining Allison parts and a long list of other defense plants are all equipped with new , special machine tools . Incidentally , persons in the industry are unanimous in saying that they absolutely can not get new machine tools except for defense work . Many defense tools are long in arriving . Where floor apace was available in old plants , most new defense tools are now in place and at work . Among the newly-built plants , those that are farthest advanced still lack about 10% of their tools ; many of them are still incomplete shells of steel , brick and glass . People here speak of a defense job being done " at the Cadillac plant " or by " the Dodge division . " Nine times out of ten , those phrases do n't mean that the work is being done on the pre-defense machinery of those plants . They mean , for instance , that in the Cadillac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine tools on which certain defense work is being done . More frequently still , such phrases mean that the managers of " the Dodge division " have been given responsibility for executing a job . The defense program is using the industry 's " know how , " not its assembly lines .
