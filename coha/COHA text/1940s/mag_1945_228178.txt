He had the story of his , or any newsman 's life-but he could n't write it . There he was , sitting in a Superfort , with arc-welder 's glasses to protect his eyes from the glare , watching the atomic bomb bore down on Nagasaki . But able , sad-faced William L. Laurence 's lips were sealed . He was the Army 's guest . <P> Bill Laurence has known more about the atomic bomb , at every stage of its development , than any other reporter . A topnotch newsman for the New York Times , he had watched , and ably reported , almost every big science story for 15 years . An intense , untidy little man with odd habits ( he spent hours placing mirrors just-so in his apartment , so that no matter where he stood he could look out on Manhattan 's East River ) , Laurence showed up at the Times pretty much when he pleased . He thought up his own assignments , often spent weeks on one story . In 1937 he won the Pulitzer Prize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the most complete story of Uranium 235 . ( The story goes that anyone who later asked for his prewar atomic article at any U.S. public library was followed home by the FBI . ) <P> When the Army had its atom bomb ready , it commandeered Laurence to write the official releases which explained the bomb . He watched the famed July 16 experiment in the New Mexico desert . Then the Army packed him off to the Pacific , to fly over Nagasaki . Last week , at last , the Army released his account of the Nagasaki raid . Thirty days after it happened , it was still top page-one news in the New York Times , and in many another paper . <P> Wrote Laurence , of the deathly bloom that rose from Nagasaki : " A giant ball of fire rose as though from the bowels of the earth . . . then a giant pillar of purple fire , 10,000 feet high , shooting skyward . ... At one stage it assumed the form of a giant square totem po'le , with its base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its center was amber , its top white . . . . Then , just when it appeared as though the thing had settled down , there came shooting out of the top a giant mushroom that increased the height of the pillar to a total of 45,000 feet . The mushroom top was even more alive than the pillar , sizzling upward , a thousand Old Faithful geysers rolled into one . "
