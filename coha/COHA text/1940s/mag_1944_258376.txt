In Sicily , Messerschmitts circled a nearby hill , but Technical Sergeant Richard Redding , stringing wire atop a telephone pole and a perfect target , worked on . Someone yelled up from below : " What are you doing up that pole ? " <P> " Working , " said Redding , too engrossed to glance down . <P> " How long you been there ? " <P> " About 20 minutes . " <P> " Do n't the planes bother you ? " <P> " Hell , no-but you do ! " <P> At the foot of the pole , Lieut . General George S. Patton , who had been doing the yelling , kept his peace .
