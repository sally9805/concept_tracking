It was the biggest , most meaningless election on earth . From Archangel to Erivan , from Knigsberg to the Kurils , almost 100 million citizens of great Russia voted this week in their first national election in eight years . <P> For weeks past , with unaccustomed candor , party chiefs had been talking to the people . The campaign keynote was fear of the world outside . <P> The Enemy , Capitalism . Candidate Lazar M. Kaganovich asserted flatly : " We are still within the capitalist encirclement . " Candidate Viacheslav Molotov warned : Russia is watchful of " possible hotbeds . . . intrigues against international security . . . . Everything must be done to make the Red Army as good as the armies of other countries . " <P> In Moscow , the day before the election , Candidate Joseph Stalin , surrounded by flowers , droned through his first speech in six months . World War II , he said , was the " inevitable result of development of world economic and political forces on a basis of monopolistic capitalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were possible to make periodic redistribution of raw materials and markets . . . . But this is impossible under present conditions of capitalistic development . . . . The Soviet social system is a better form of organization of society than any other non-Soviet social system . " <P> Without mentioning the atomic bomb , Stalin promised that Soviet scientists would " not only catch up with but . . . surpass " those abroad . He stressed the role of industry in war , proclaimed that the new five-year plan must work toward production increases big enough " to guarantee our country against any eventuality . " <P> Ultimately the nation would have to produce an annual 60 million tons of steel , 500 million tons of coal , 60 million tons of oil , * but these goals might require three more five-year plans . <P> Stalin 's speech contained no threats . It was dry in tone , defensive in content . But its truculent exaggeration of the danger of attack from the capitalist world was the most warlike pronouncement uttered by any top-rank statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft " during the war , has been gradually hardening into a return to the tactics and slogans of world revolution . Comrades everywhere could be expected to take a tip from Uncle Joe 's speech and sharpen their opposition to non-Communist governments . <P> Yet Stalin may have had purely Russian reasons for pointing outward toward imagined enemies . Restless Russians have been asking for more food , clothes and " luxuries . " Although Stalin in his speech announced that food rationing would soon end , the foreign menace is still his handiest excuse for low living standards . <P> The Choice . Candidate Stalin headed the slate of Communist Party and Communist-picked nonparty men . Though the results are never in doubt , Soviet elections are taken most seriously . Communist party workers scurry about factories , farms and homes , going through a complicated " primary-election " sifting process that gives millions of Russians the illusion that they participate in their country 's government .
