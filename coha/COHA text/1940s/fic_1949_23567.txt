be paid for the mines ; Frick had to be called in as intermediary ; and the price which was finally set seemed to Gary beyond all reason . A few days earlier it had been Gary who had insisted on the purchase of the mines ; now , when the issue had become merely one of price and not of dealing with a man he did n't like , it was Morgan who was insistent . " Judge Gary , " said he , " in a business proposition as great as this would you let a matter of five million dollars stand in the way of success ? " And lie accepted the Rockefeller price . Clearly the amount of capital stock which the new concern would have to issue to take care of all these payments would be enormous . But he would rather drive ahead than haggle . And so there appeared in the newspapers of March 3 , 1901 ? less than three months after the Simmons-Stewart dinner  --  a large advertisement announcing that under the laws of New Jersey there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the outstanding stocks and bonds of the Carnegie Company but also the preferred and common stocks of Federal Steel , National Steel , National Tube , . American Steel &; Wire , American Tin Plate , American Steel Hoop , and American Sheet Steel . To these , a little later , were added the Lake Superior Consolidated Iron Mines and the American Bridge Company . This new concern would embrace under a single management and control roughly three-fifths of the steel business of the entire country ; and its .. otal capitalization would reach  --  at par value ? the altogether astonishing , altogether unprecedented figure of $1,402,846,817 ? nearly a billion and a half dollars ! VI T T THE news there arose a great outcry of wonder and dismay  --  with the dismay at first predominating . Some news-paper editors expressed the fear that such con-centration of power in Wall Street would lead the public to welcome socialism as the lesser of two evils . President Hadley of Yale said in a speech in Boston that unless trusts were regulated by an effective public senti-ment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " The London Chronicle was especially sharp in its com-MAGAZINE ment . " It is little less than a menace to the commerce of the civilized world , " said the Chronicle ; " it sets the seal to the triumph of the millionaire . " And as usual Finley Peter Dunne 's " Mr. Dooley " put into the mouth of an Irish saloon-keeper sentiments which suggested what millions of people were vaguely feeling : Pierpont Morgan calls in wan iv his office boys , the ' prisidint iv a national bank , an ' says he , " James , " he says , " take some change out iv th ' damper an ' r-run out an ' buy Europe f'r me , " he says . " I intind to re-organize it an ' put it on a paying basis , " he says . " Call up the Czar an ' the ' Pope an ' th ' Sultan an th ' Impror Willum , an ' tell him we wo n't need their savices afther nex ' week , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' , James , " he says , " ye betther put that r-red headed bookkeeper near th ' dure in charge iv th ' continent . He does n't seem to be ( loin ' much , " he says . Assuredly the new corporation represented a very large gesture of faith . For not only did it issue its own stock on a lavish basis to the owners of the constituent companies in order to induce them to come in , but almost all of these constituent companies had already issued their own stock equally lavishly to the owners of still smaller concerns . AccoFding to the Bureau of Corporations , the Steel Corporation 's investment in tangible property alone , indicated by historical analysis , was $676 millions ; the value of all property , tangible and intangible , as indicated by market values of prices of constituent concerns , was $793 millions ; and yet the total capitalization amounted to all of 51,402 millions . Even making due allowance for the integration , increased efficiency , and increased bargaining power which such an enormous corporation supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay dividends upon such a mass of securities ? And , for that matter , would the investing public be able to digest such a great issue of stock ? This latter question was soon answered . fames R. Keene was engaged by the Morgan syndicate to make a market in Steel Corporation stock ; and so actively did this skilled operator keep the market churning , and so mightily did the chance to invest in the biggest company on earth appeal to buyers ' imagi-nations , that the preferred stock , starting on the Stock Exchange at a price of 82% , soon went to 1017/8 , while the common stock , starting at 38. rose to 55 ? amidst a burst of speculative enthusiasm which astonished the the elders of Wall Street . A great many of the chief beneficiaries of the mighty prices paid for the stock of the constituent companies were Pittsburgh steel men , and now Pittsburgh witnessed a carnival of spending such as it had never known before . According to Herbert N. Casson , one of the sudden millionaires in Pittsburgh " ordered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his name and coat of arms on the wrapper " ; another " had his wife 's portrait painted by every obtainable foreign and American artist " ; the city became " a Klondike for artists , book agents , curio dealers , and merchants who had expensive gewgaws for sale . A young Carnegie partner would say : ' See that painting ? Cost me $22,000 ; but I could get $28,000 for it . Have a cigar . Fine brand . Seventy-five cents apiece wholesale . ' " The Morgan syndicate , for that matter , did very well indeed ; here , too , Mr. Dill 's device for the manufacture of millionaires worked beautifully . The syndicate had been paid for its services in launching the new combination with a big block of stock , amounting to nearly 1,300,000 shares . When this stock had been " distributed " ? sold on the Exchange during the speculative excitement  --  the syndicate 's profit , including the managers ' fee , came to $57,515,000 , plus some preferred stock and the right to participate in a subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $60,000,000 or more . The House of Morgan 's share in these profits ? its fee for managing the syndicate  --  came to $11,505,000 , again plus stock and participation in the news syndicate ; this enabled the firm , at the close of the year 1902 , to transfer to profit and loss the sum of exactly twelve million dollars . It had been an enormous and highly risky operation , completed with rich success . ORGAN himself remained in New York for a month after the great announce- ment . By that time he felt assured that all was well . The reliable Gary was going to be chairman of the board of the Steel Corporation : Schwab was going to be president ; Bacon , head of the finance committee . He felt he could trust them all ; Gates he vetoed even for membership in the board of directors . Whatever the future might hold for the new corporation , it was off to a very favorable start . On April 4 , well satisfied , he sailed for Europe on the Teutonic , accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , crowds gaped at him . He slipped aboard the Teutonic by the second cabin gangway to outwit the reporters and photographers ; when he reached Euston Station in London there ryas another small army of them and another great crowd of the general public . He forced his way through them , hating their curiosity and their interference with his privacy . He could not learn to stomach the staring and crowding and reportorial inquisitiveness that must now be the lot of one of the mightiest personages in the world . It was said that certain English brokers were taking out insurance policies on his life , paying premiums at the rate of ? 30 on the ? 1000 for three months to protect their American investments if he should die while overseas . And why not ? Was there not much truth in what John Brisben Walker had written in the Cosmopolitan ( which was then a magazine containing much serious political discussion ) for April : that " the world , on the 3rd day of March , 1901 , ceased to be ruled by . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's real rulers " were " those who control the concentrated portion of the money supply " ? Perhaps ; but Pierpont Morgan was tired , and he wanted to settle down quietly in his great house at Prince 's Gate and enjoy the beautiful things that the dealers would bring him to see . And so lie ( lid . Within a very few days he had bought Gainsborough 's famous portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire . The third and final article of this series , next month , will deal with Morgan 's regal manner of life during the years which followed the Steel Corporation promotion. ? The Editors Arma Virumque Cano A Story by Jessamyn West Illustrations by Marvin Bileck I T WAS early spring . In the arroyo , a quarter of a mile south of the Kinsman ranch , cactus was already blooming . Meadow larks sang their liquid , worldly songs . Butcher birds , rich in insects , impaled their surplus stock on suitable thorns . Road runners ran for pleasure and without pursuit . Ground squirrels , bereft of what little caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their burrows . Buzzards floated low , their shadows dark on the grass which the sun , almost down , was gilding . But the air was still warm , the day still lovely , and the arroyo continued to echo , as it had for the past hour , with the stateliest measures ever moulded by the lips of man , the long roiling periods of Virgil . " Ancora de prora iacitur , scant litore puppes , " Paul concluded , taking his eyes from his invisible audience and looking inquiringly at Kate Kinsman , who sat across the ravine from him on a large , sun-warmed boulder . " Begin at the beginning and say it all over again , " Kate urged . " Not that I do n't think you 're perfect right now , " she added frankly . Paul relaxed somewhat , but still looked worried . " Perfect means incapable of improvement , " he reminded Kate . / do n't see how you can improve it , " Kate protested , her fair , freckled face Hushed with sunlight and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart and you pronounce every word right . What more could you do ? " Paul scowled across the narrow arroyo as if its smallness hampered his imagination . " If I was good enough , " he said slowly , " I could put the whole spirit of Virgil in it . " He paused and looked earnestly at Kate . " If I was good enough I could put the whole spirit of the ancient world in it . " " Well , okay , then , " Kate said enthusiastically . " Let 's do that . Let 's be absolutely terrific . " Paul replied a little stiffly , " I was n't jok-ing . " " Me either , " Kate exclaimed , surprised . " Was n't that what you meant , Paul ? " " I was n't thinking about being terrific or anything like that . " Kate , who had been , said , " I 'm sorry , Paul . " " You kind of always overstate things , Kate . " " Paul , " Kate asked leaning forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed his steel rimmed spectacles and cleaned them on an oblong of white canton flannel neatly feather-stitched in blue around the edges . Kate took note of it , thinking she might make Paul a like present for his birthday if she could learn to feather-stitch in three months time , which she doubted . " Do you , Paul ? " she repeated . Paul resettled his spectacles . " I think you 're pretty hasty sometimes , Kate . " Hasty was not the same as impetuous and Kate returned to Virgil . " Go on , Paul , " she said . " Say your part through from the beginning again . " " It 's your turn to say your part , " Paul told her . " My little two lines , " Kate scoffed . " A chain is no stronger than its weakest link , " Paul said honestly , " and your lines have their place in the play . " The play , " Scenes From the Aeneid , " was was to be presented in one week 's time by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing togas and huaraches , garlanded with chaplets of eucalyptus leaves and carrying short swords carved from Sunkist orange boxes , the Latin classes demonstrated to assembled parents their mastery of the language . This year 's demonstration was unusually ambitious and Paul , as narrator , was , after Aeneas himself , its most important male personage . 1 ooktivo at Paul now Kate thought that , with his dark hair falling in a jagged j line across his high white forehead and his eyes lifted to the rim of the arroyo , he looked like a great , tragic actor , or perhaps , except for his glasses , Hamlet himself . It was easy to imagine that the battlements of Elsinore had been of the same smoky gray green as the tall cactus which now served him as a back-drop and that the problems which he pondered had to do , not with a high-school play , but with love and death and guilt and madness . " Paul , " she asked , " would you like to play Hamlet ? " Paul shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor about the problem he had presented to Miss Freitag , Latin teacher and director of the play . He was the best student in Miss Freitag 's classes and he could memorize Latin verse more eas. ily and deliver it with greater sonority and conviction than any other of her pupils . But his appearance was woefully unclassic and he knew it . And not only did he have a nonVirgilian look , but in some unfortunate manner , he communicated a non-Virgilian look to all which , until he came upon the scene , appeared authentic . Paul seemed to be a touchstone of reality . The minute he stepped on the stage , chaplets , which , until that time had been easily recognizable as of the true laurel became nothing more than circles of wire incompletely covered with eucalyptus leaves . And the short swords , for all their aluminum paint , immediately reverted to the soft pine of orange boxes . Worst of all the toga , which on the other boys was a picturesque and dignified garment , obviously appropriate for poets and statesmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public wear . Miss Freitag had tried putting Paul into a short tunic , but that had been even worse . Atlas Peake , the Aeneas of the play , took one look at him , thus scantily covered , and said , " You 're sure lucky to be living today , Skinny . The Romans would 've exposed you at birth . " Miss Freitag , while considering this statement untactful , thought it probably true , and was proud of her final solution of the problem posed by Paul . She developed the part of narrator for him , kept him off the stage entirely and clothed him in a manner intended to suggest a professor of the classics : thin legs , hidden by striped gray professorial trousers , narrow shoulders incased in a frock coat , necessary spectacles given the appearance of scholarship by a length of dangling , black gros-grain ribbon . These make-shifts , which Paul saw truly enough as occasioned by his own deficiencies , appeared to Kate to be nothing more than a tribute to his uniqueness . Ignoring his reluctance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I bet you could play Hamlet if you wanted to . " " Well , I do n't want to , " Paul answered shortly . " Okay , " Kate persisted stubbornly . " You do n't have to , but you could . Go on , " she said hurriedly before Paul had a chance to - tiZt contradict her , " say your part through once again . I can say mine on the way home . " p AUL straightened himself as if about to begin , then lowered his chin and looked about . The arroyo while narrow , was deep , a sandy , golden , cactus-filled waste , lonely , strange and , at this time of the day , a little mysterious . " This probably looks a good deal like Africa , " he said . " Africa ? " Kate asked , her thoughts far from there . " Where Aeneas met Dido . " " Oh ! It 's a good place to be practicing then , is n't it ? " Paul nodded . " It 's funny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgil and Virgil did n't even know the new world existed . Let alone the United States . " " Let alone California . " " Let alone this arroyo and you and me in it , " Paul said , and he and Kate both laughed . " Maybe he does know , " Kate said . " Maybe he 's alive some place and listening . " " Do you believe in life after death , Kate ? " Paul asked seriously . Kate sighed with pleasure . Perhaps they would now have a philosophical discussion . That was one of the things she liked so much about Paul ; he was interested in everything and would talk about everything : life , death , honor , immortality , transubstantiation . Did everyone see the same chair ? If you could hear the intervals of silence in music , would they be music , too ? At what minute did a bird swallowed by a cat cease to want to chirp and begin to want to meow , instead ? Now she replied judiciously , " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't reply . Far off in the Santa Ana valley Kate heard a train whistle . A hummingbird dropped into the arroyo , whirred disappointedly about the wild tobacco blossoms which were still too green for honey . A lizard ran half way up the boulder she sat on , looked at her , then ran down again . " Do n't you , Paul ? " she asked again . But Paul only shook his head . Evidently he was not in the mood for a philosophical discussion this afternoon . " You got time to hear me through once more ? " he asked . " Of course , " Kate said . " That 's what I 've been waiting for . Begin at the beginning . Begin at , ' Arms , I sing , and the man ' . " Kate imitated somewhat Paul 's polished , declamatory style . But without the Latin words the imitation was rather flat . " Arena virumque cano Troiae qui prim us ab oris , " Paul began , his r 's liquid as water , his m 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably on her boulder to listen . If Paul did n't look like a Roman he at least came nearer than anyone else in Tenant to sounding like one . He had gotten as far as Dido 's curse , " Et lam prima novo spargebat lumine terras , " when glancing at the bank above Kate 's head he broke off . " Hi , there ! " he said in a flat voice . K ATE turned about . There , above her , was Clarence Rambo  --  known , because of his red hair and ability to cover ground , as the Crimson Rambler . The Crimson Rambler now stood , legs wide apart and hands in pockets , regarding her and Paul curiously . " The Rambler himself , " Kate said without enthusiasm . She and Clarence were not on good terms . He had passed her a note in study hall which she , after seeing the first few words , had taken up to the waste paper basket and ostentatiously torn into a thousand pieces without further reading . Now , as Clarence dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his red , good-natured face and his small , reddish-brown eyes . " Nice hide-out you two got here , " he observed . " Hide-out ! " Kate exclaimed . " Yep , hide-out . What you two do down here , anyway ? " " Do ? We 're practicing , " Kate told him with dignity . This struck the Rambler as being very funny and he laughed immoderately . " Practicing ! " he was finally able to say . " What you two practicing down here in your hide-out , Kate ? " " We 're rehearsing for the Latin play , " Paul said . He pulled his copy of " Scenes From the Aeneid " from his pocket as if to prove it . " Scenes From the Aeneid , " he explained . This also seemed very funny to the Rambler . He laughed so hard that the skin was drawn tightly across the two bony protusions above his eyes and the eyes themselves were narrowed to the merest slits . " Scenes From the Aeneid ! Say did you ever hear this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , Least it used to be First it killed the Romans Now its killing me . " " We 've heard it , " Kate said . " It 's very , very funny . Also very , very old . " " I know some more , " Clarence said . " New . Want to hear some more ? Also in Latin . " " Beat it , Rambo , " Paul said . " Get out of here . We 're busy . " The Rambler looked at Paul very coolly . " Drop dead , Skinny , " he advised , " and save the doctor 's bill . " Then he turned again to Kate . " You want to hear some more , Kate ? I can make up poetry . Latin poetry . " " You and Virgil , " Kate said lamely . " Sure , me and Virgil . I sing of arms and the woman . " " Shut up , Rambo , " Paul said . " I 'm not talking to you , Skinny . You go off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem 's about you , Kate . Amu , auras , amat , Kinsman 's plenty hot . How d' you like that Kate ? More truth than poetry , huh ? " Paul threw " Scenes From the Aeneid " to the ground . " Cut that out , Rambo . " " Oh hell , Skinny , " Clarence said easily , " do n't let it worry you just because it did n't come out of a book . You 'd be surprised what ai n't in books . Besides that 's just the beginning . A mo ? amas , amat . Kinsman's --  " Clarence stopped suddenly and Kate , who had been watching him , too amazed and shocked to speak , turned toward Paul . Paul was holding threateningly aloft a large andvery spiny section of the cactus plant beside which he stood . " Do n't that hurt , Skinny ? " Clarence asked finally , a little uncertainly . " You shut up , " Paul told him , " or you 'll soon find out . " " Why , Skinny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just like pulling a gun on an unarmed man ? " " Okay , " Paul said . " I 've got a gun and you 're unarmed . And you better shut up and get out of here or fire it . And another one right behind it . " Paul extended his free hand in the direction of the cactus plant at his side . " Two-gun , Skinnyl " Clarence 's voice was heavy with sarcasm . " Three-gun , four-gun , if you do n't beat it , " Paul said , unmoved . " I was only making a little joke , Kate do n't " Shut up about Kate , " Paul told him , lifting the cactus section menacingly , " and beat it . " " You do n't have to keep saying it , " Clarence said . " I got no desire to hang around where I 'm not wanted . Where all people can think of to do is to bop each other over the head with pieces of cactus . " He climbed the embankment slowly and unconcernedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
