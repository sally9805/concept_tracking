txt ARAB AND ZIONIST CLASH ON PARTITION IN FINAL APPEALS Husseini Calls on Principle of Self-Determination to Vindicate His Stand 1WEIZMANN SUMS UP CASE , Tells U. N. a Divided State Is Only Practical Compromise ? Sees It as DP Solution Arab argument on Palestine , Page 27 ; Weizmann 's , Page 26 . ? By MARSHALL E. NEWTON Special to Tstz NEW Yong Timms . LAKE SUCCESS , N. Y. , Oct. 18 ? Arab and Zionist representatives made their final appeals to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine today . Their views were as opposed and as unwavering as they were at the beginning of the debate . Dr. Chaim Weizmann , former president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine , who for more than a quarter of a century has carried the torch of Zionism , closed the case for his cause , accepting the principle of partition as the only practicable compromise that faced hard facts and offered an escape from deadlock and frustration . The Arab plea was presented before the crammed committee room by Jamal el-Husseini , vice chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution that gave the " overwhelming majority " of the indigenous Arab population self-determination and warned that a small Jewish state in the heart of an Arab world " can have no chance of survival " and would become a " running sore " if bolstered by permanent foreign support . Replying to a charge of the Jewish Agency that the Arabs " flouted " the United Nations while coming to it for justice and equity , Mr. el-Husseini said that if the agency had in mind the refusal of the Arab groups to meet with the Special Inquiry Committee in Palestine , this decision was taken because the terms of reference of the committee omitted the directive that due consideration to the interests of the inhabitants be considered . If the Jewish Agency referred to the Arab statement that it would ' , oppose partition , Mr. el-Husseini said , " this again is not flouting ; it is the recognized and sacred right // of self-defense , consecrated by the law of God and the law of nature . It is equally recognized by the Charter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zionist attack on the Arab position that eastern European Jews had no ethnic connection with Palestine . He quoted from the Jewish Encyclopedia as well as other authorities . Mr. El-Hussein declared that the Zionists had built their case on the " false pretense " of ethnic connection with Palestine : He charged that the whole idea was a " myth " and that the Zionists were trying to set up a national home in a country to which they had no claim . Dr. Weizmann gave an opposed point of view on his closing address . From the intimate knowledge of his long association with the Palestine question , Dr. Weizmann told of the kindling of Jewish hopes for a " home  --  not a refuge , " as he had done upon leaving the council rooms of another international organization a generation ago , the League of Nations . Times have changed and new conditions have arisen , Dr. Weizmann said , but he added that he could not pass on to.consideration of these facts without a tribute to the vision and courage of the signatories to the Palestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of independence , where I , believe it now stands . " Acceptance of partition for Palestine is difficult for one who " knows that the original purpose of the mandate involved no such limitation as is now proposed , " Dr. Weizmann said . However , it represents , he added , the only practical compromise that faces the hard facts and offers an escape from deadlock and frustration . The idea of a Jewish state is not new but is the " inevitable and foreseen consummation " , of the mandate , Dr. Weizmann said . " The main justification , the main necessity for a Jewish state arises from the facts and urgencies of life itself , " he continued , declaring himself in agreement with the Soviet representative that formal considerations of law and history were secondary at this moment . The venerable Zionist spokesman said the Jewish community in Palestine was a community with a great democratic spirit and a thoroughgoing democratic structure , confronting- another group that was in a different stage of development but was numerically superior . " The question before the assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed " he asserted . The three alternatives , Dr. Weizmann said , are trusteeship , Arab rule or rule by the Jewish community and the simplest analysis must lead to the conclusions of the majority report , putting aside the question of a mandate or trusteeship . ? The Jewish national home , " he added , must be independent or remain a minority subject to the will of the Arab majority . Those who have spoken against the report , he said , advocate a Jewish minority in an Arab state . The Jews who a'bcepted an international promise and made ' their I homes in Palestine did not do so to become " Arab citizens of Jewish persuasion , " Dr. Weizmann said . He added that he would not comment on the position of Jews in an Arab state , but would leave that to the Jews of Iraq , Yemen and Tripoli . He noted that disgarding of the mandate and rejection of minority status in an Arab state would leave only one possible condition , " partition and Jewish statehood . " In asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been conferred on the Arabs , Dr. Weizmann said . " Independence is not the exclusive right of the Arabs , " he continued . " We Jews have an equal claim to it . This Assembly can not possibly decree that the desire of the Arabs to possess an eighth state must obliterate the right of the Jews to possess a single center of independent national life . " Despite the views of previous speakers , Dr. Weizmann expressed confidence in the attainment of Arab-Jewish cooperation once a settlement " based on finality and equality has received the sanction of international consent . " Acceptance of the majority report would also provide a solution of the problem of displaced Jews in Europe , Dr. Weizmann said . The proposed Jewish state can provide homes for all through intensive agriculture and industrial development , he declared , and " the only hand of welcome extended to these Jewish survivors is the one which reaches out from our people in Palestine . " Dr. Weizmann asked that the committee consider modifications proposed by the Zionists in respect to Western Galilee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question how the decision of the General Assembly might be carried out , he said : " We feel , however , that the prospects of peace will be brightest if the Jewish forces maintaining security within our own state are accompanied at the outset by an international force to symbolize the consent and decision of the United Nations . " Supporting the views of other Zionist speakers , he declared : " But in all circumstances our people are prepared to make full provision for their own defense . " Dr. Weizmann closed his argument with an appeal to the " bar of the world 's conscience . " " A world which 151oes not hear us in this moment of our agony would be deaf to the voice of justice and human feeling , which must be raised loud and clear if the moral foundations of our society are to survive . " The Arab spokesman , on the other hand , had asserted that all committees of inquiry into Arab rising had agreed that the underlying cause of Arab violence was opposition to immigration and deprivation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zionist violence as intended to force the British to permit further immigration . The Arab spokesman flatly denied Zionist claims of economic benefit to the country from Jewish immigration . It was Arab initiative that reclaimed the biggest swamps , not Jewish , he declared . Arab agriculture is economically sound , he stated , but Jewish agriculture is not and he quoted the treasurer to the Jewish Agency to the effect that the Jewish Agricultural Settlement was $60,000 , - 000 in debt . He declared the Arabs " are determined to resist any attempt to frustrate their rights to self-determination in the same manner and zeal as any other people . " He said that the sword placed in the scales by the United States could chop off the last Arab head in Palestine , but he was confident the sincerity , ind intelligence of the American peoples " will see that it is neither to their interests nor consistent with their traditions to play the role of enforcing the decision of their Government in favor of the partition of Palestine . " Replying to Moshe Shertok , spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment that an offer by Iraq in 1910 to provide two divisions for the British Middle East Command if the 1939 White Paper was put into effect was rejected because of the ? influence of the Jewish Agency . The Arab spokesman said that the British commander had told the Iraq Minister that the proposal could not be accepted unless the Jewish Agency agreed , because of the great influence of that organization in the United States , whose help was then vital to Britain . On Monday the committee will begin discussion of the specific proposals submitted . Some of them are modifications of the majority report , which would partition the Holy Land into Arab and Jewish states ; others offer means of providing the police force that would be necessary to enforce any settlement decided upon by the United Nations , in view of Britain 's decision that she must withdraw from the Palestine mandate and will not undertake to impose any settlement unless it is acceptable to the Zionists and the Arabs .               @ @ @ @ @ @
