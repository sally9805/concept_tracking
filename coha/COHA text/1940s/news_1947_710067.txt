txt Conditions in the South and in India JEFF P. BEELAND . Letters to The Times Conditions in the South and in India To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read with interest the letter of Dr. Sundaram in your Dec. 26 edition relative to race conditions in the South . Dr. Sundaram has had the opportunity of a visit to the South . I have not had the pleasure of a visit to India . His statements of conditions here repeat the often-repeated tale of the sharecropper . While it is true two wrongs do not make a right , perhaps it would be revealing for Dr. Sundaram to bring to our understanding the wretched poverty , caste system and the Untouchables of India . How many races are there in India ? is segregation of classes or races practiced in India ? Are Untouchables or lower classes permitted travel , eat and attend all public functions on an equal basis ? Jr.a .. e P. BEELAND . Greenville , Ala. , Dec. 27 , 1946.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
