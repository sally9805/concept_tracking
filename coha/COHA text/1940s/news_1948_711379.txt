txt Looking at wholesale prices for commodities in their primary markets , it is to be expected that the pattern of change there is now to differ from that which has prevailed , with minor divergencies , since the beginning of World War II in 1939 . In general , prices for farm products have more than trebled during the period , while industrial products have Fallen considerably short of doubling in these nine years . It should be noted , of course . that their fall during the depression of the 1930s was not as great as the decline in the prices for foodstuffs and fibres . vita toe wars aamage to and displacement of current production being gradually overcome in many countries , the normal thing would be for all prices to recede from their war-made levels . But normal price movements are being Interfered with by a wide variety of government interventions . Apart from the old familiar tariffs and quota restrictions , we now have the added and powerful factors of Inter-government gifts and probably unrepayable credits , plus disordered currencies and the obstinacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foremost commercial nations wage workers have inherited from the war a political influence and an economic power which further interfere with the normal corrective action of completely free markets . Nevertheless there are signs that hereafter farm products prices may not be running ahead of those for industrial products as they have been doing . On the contrary . they seem likely to lag behind the procession to their tun. , on bile manufactured goods take the lead , either actually or relatively . Higher prices for the tatter are positively indicated by the round of wage increases now being completed , which appears not at all unlikely to be followed by another round of the same . But the output of foodstuffs and certain raw materials , cotton for example . is responding to the world 's great need and the price stimulus . Our own wheat crop premises to he the second largest in our history and the outlook for corn has much improved since planting began . Europe will raise more food this year than for many years past . Hence the conclusion that the pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years appears to be warranted . As far as the American farmer 's domestic markets are concerned , whatever depressing influences the year 's harvests bring to bear on them will be under restraint . Governmental price support is to continue through 1949 practically as is . The supporting levels are based parity ' - prices and these automatically rise or fall with prices for the things the farmer buys . And the latter are being marked up . For another thing , the Economic Cooperation Administration has decided that our bread gram exports to Europe are not to be diminished by any increase in Europe 's own production , on the ground that the average European diet should be improved . A considerable loss of steel production due to the coal miners ' vacation is now followed by a further loss caused by a strike in the " captive " mines owned by steel companies , with whom some other miners have been sympathetic enough to remain away from the pits . The captive mines will be idle at least until next Wednesday , the day set by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' e National Labor Relations Board for a virtual order that the strikers return to work in the captive mines . This and earlier losses of steel output aggravate a demand-supply situation which is one of the worst in the country , from the consumer 's point of view . It adds somewhat to the other pressures on steelmakers to advance prices . Apparently a more serious price factor in relation to steel and all the many forms in which it reaches the ultimate buyer is the industry 's abandonment of the basing-point system of quoting prices . This follows a Supreme Court decision against the similar practice of the cement manufacturers , which apparently will oblige a number of basic industries to alter their selling methods . Overthrow of this price quotation method will have mixed consequences . First . it will disrupt sonic buyer-seller relationships of long standing . Something like a scramble to place orders with near-by producers may be expected ; consumers distant from any producer will evidently pay relatively more than heretofore . It has been said that the ruling favors producers who are able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those located where mill capacity exceeds the local or regional capacity to consume , since it ends or greatly limits their freedom to compete in distant markets . It may be found that this prosecution of an asserted restraint of trade kills competition in some areas and fosters it in others . If the decision stands without later modification it may encourage the establishment of industrial plants in important consumption centers which have so far been without them Failing that , consumers distant from production areas will have to get along with less competition for their orders . ? ? ? Railroad engineers , firemen and switchmen who had set a nationwide strike for May 11 and so caused the President to put the rails tinder government control have settled their dispute on substantially the same terms proposed by a presidential board last March . It is worth noting that in this case the government 's representatives brought about a reluctant agreement without much raising their bid for peace . But the same organizations assert that they are already preparing another wage demand .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
