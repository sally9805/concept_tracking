And this man , " indicating Joseph Scott , attorney for his discarded mistress , is trying to make inferences as tho I 'm a monster ! " This was the high point of the day as Chaplin 's trial actually got under way before a jury of seven women and five men . It was so high and so violent that it evoked immediate response from Carol Ann Berry , the 14 month old baby whom Chaplin is accused of fathering . Carol Ann , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bright , brown eyes , cooed . - Afternoon of Clashes . Not that the clash ? was unusual . It was an afternoon of clashes between Scott and Chaplin , starting in a minor tempo when Chaplin , apparently poised , confident , and almost gay , took the stand . Soon the conflict gathered such momentum that everyone was shouting . After one of these episodes the baby , the nominal plaintiff in the suit , was taken from the courtroom wailing . Earlier in the day Scott and Charles H. Millikan , Chaplin 's attorney , made opening statements to the jury and Dr. Russell W. Starr , 48 , obstetrician who delivered Carol Ann , testified that in his opinion conception took place a few days after Dec. 13 last year . Miss Berry 's attorneys are seeking to prove that Carol Ann was conceived the night of Dec. 23 or the following morning .

Instead of that you break in here with the gun . . . " " And it was a one-sided speech ? " Scott asked again . She Seemed Inarticulate . " Miss Berry said very little because she seemed to be very inarticulate . " " After you lectured her ? " " I said much more than I am saying now ! " Chaplin seemed indignant ; " Do you want to hear the lecture ? " The courtroom snickered , but CHAPLIN BANGS WITNESS CHAIR , SHOUTS DENIALS Tells of His Relationship with Joan Berry . // as usual , giving him for a moment his sole resemblance to the shabby little clown he once portrayed . Judge Willis felt it necessary to tell the jury why Chaplin was there . He had been called as an adverse party by the plaintiff , permissible under the California civil code , but the plaintiff , the judge stated , is not bound by anything he might say , altho the plantiff can controvert it . - Scott , his questions spit out in rapid sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a date that meant nothing to the defend . ant until a gun was mentioned .

" Then where did you see her ? " Scott continued . Came to His Bedroom . " Miss Berry appeared in my bedroom , " came Chaplin 's careful , precise enunciations . " It was about midnight , and I was telephoning some one when my attention was attracted to the door that leads to my bathroom . " Here he began to act it out , his words and face directed always to the jury , emotion flitting across his countenance . " I looked . I saw . . . breathless pause . . . Miss Berry . She had . . . pause a gun . She circled around She had this gun . Then I spoke . What is she up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my house in order to create a scandal . That she was going to teach me ! That she was destitute . " Then I said . ' Why do you treat me this way ? When I have tried everything in the world to build you up not only : materially but spiritually , to teach you to act . . . pause because I believed in you ! " ? The fervor of this memory caused him to strike his fists against the railing before his chair . " I believed in that girl ! " he cried . Then , as tho he still were addressing her and not the jury , " - why do you conspire against me ? Why do you break into my house ? Why ? " " Just a minute , " came the cold , cold voice of .. Scott . " Was this a one-sided conversation , ? Mr. Chaplin ? " " No ! " hissed Chaplin . " I lectured her ! . . . " " Did n't she say anything ? " Scott asked , innocently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glared at Scott . " This is the sum and total . . . " He began . " The question before the court , " Scott rasped out , " " is what did she say ?

' And I said , ' How can you behave ? ' " Tried to Reason with Her . " What did she say ? " came Scott again . " I reasoned with her , " Chaplin went on . " I said , ' why are you doing this ? Why are you harassing Scott 's gruff voice was already tossing the next question in . " What happened after the lecture ? " " I said , ' You can not sleep here . ' " " And what did she say ?

But that inexorable voice merely said again , " What did she say ? " Chaplin never did remember . But he told of trying to persuade his " children " to go home asked their ages , he said both now are in the armyJ , for they had been aroused by the nocturnal visitation . Then he went back upstairs to Joan . Q. ? What happened then ? A. ? Then ? Then I went on lecturing . Q. ? What did you say ? I do n't know .

" Pardon his , " Scott mimicked , " I 'm sorry I hurt your feelings . " " I 'm used to it , " Chaplin replied . Laughter filled the courtroom and the judge admonished for several minutes . Q. To use the word " intimate relations " then , the last time was February ? A. A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember it was when she was going to school and studying the dramma . Q.

Is n't it a fact that she moved into the other bedroom because you ' were snoring so ? Millikan interrupted with , " I do n't think the witness is competent to answer that . How is he to know when he is snoring ? " Some people say they ca n't hear themselves snore , " the judge ruled . " Some say they can . " A. by Chaplin ? No , that is not a fact .

" Scott asked " She may have said a few things , " Chaplin replied , " but I don't. remember them . " " You did most of the talking ? " Always Helped Her . " Naturally .

I 'm trying to get the sequence of events . . the night before she was taken off my premises by the police . " What transpired that night certainly was not clear to any one in the courtroom today . About everything he said . . . . ' I 'm not sure . . . I 'm not sure . There are big gaps in my memory . " He was equally vague about the night he summoned the police to arrest her .

" The defendant milli prove to you that he is not and could not be the father I of this plaintiff child .
