Five days after Franklin Roosevelt returned to his desk , the German Foreign Office intimated that continued peace between the Reich and the U. S. hung in the balance . A Nazi spokesman complained of U. S. " pinpricks . " A warning to the U. S. came from the Rome press . The Axis , having for months ignored not only U. S. aid to Britain but the whole U. S. defense program designed to thwart its plans for world domination , had decided to try talking tough . <P> This change of tone suggested that perhaps Franklin Roosevelt had really touched the Axis ' quick with his increasing and increasingly pointed measures to strengthen the Axis ' great foe . It suggested even more strongly that the Axis had decided to take advantage of existing isolationist sentiment in the U. S. to divide and confuse the biggest " pluto-democracy , " in order to slow up aid to Britain at a vital moment in the war . <P> The President in this hour of urgency had two ends in view . One was speed to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Hitler may invade Britain . The other was to expand the whole U. S. economy into enormous productivity for the long-term struggle against a possibly victorious Axis -a project that was moving like a big river , so broad that the actual speed of the current was almost imperceptible . <P> Of these two ends , the first was more immediate . The President moved to answer criticisms of the Defense Commission , by a new organization . He turned laconic Commissioner William Knudsen into a pamphleteer to state the " terrible urgency . " plead with the U. S. to " roll up their sleeves . " <P> To London 's vital outpost , the Ambassadorship to the Court of St. James 's , he prepared to send no blundering politico but one of the ablest career diplomats in the Foreign Service , shrewd , handsome Norman Armour , now Ambassador to Argentina . Mr. Armour 's record was a quick index to his ability : posts at Paris ( twice ) . Petrograd , Brussels , The Hague , Montevideo , Rome . Tokyo , Port-au-Prince , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mr. Roosevelt went further . He outlined in general terms an entirely new form of aid to Britain . At a press conference , after telling newsmen that there was " no news today . " he held forth in monologue for 45 minutes . From it emerged the shape of his plan to aid Britain more directly without tangling in such political barbed wire as the Johnson and Neutrality Acts , for moves to amend either act would mean filiblustery months of debate in Congress while England was being bombed barren .
