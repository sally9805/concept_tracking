Mr. Dulles said he went to Washington in the hope and expectation of working for such legislation , " but the Democrats denied me that chance " and " if you send me back , I 'll make the chance . " Accusing President Truman of failing to make good his campaign promises , Mr. Dulles pictured his opponent , former Gov . Herbert H. Lehman , as the choice of " those who have broken faith with the people .

It went back for an indecent burial in the-4 McCarrancontrolled committee . " Mr. Dulles ridiculed his opponent for " posing as the great champion of human rights and implying that only through him and his party can civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to perpetrate the ( myth that the Democratic high command has a monopoly of all the humanitarianism and good-will in the World and that therefore they must be made all-powerful because only they are benevolent enough to administer power and to take care of us all . " Party Records Contrasted Terming this " a very silly thesis , " he went on : " Indeed , a man must be far gone in conceit to pretend in this State of ' New York that the Democratic party is alone concerned with civil rights . " The people of the whole nation ' had to - wait fen . New - York to blaze the way by enacting an Anti-Discrimination in Employment Law , and they had to wait until there was a Republican State administration to get that . They are still waiting on **29;384;TOOLONG . ' Mr. Dulles traced the case histories of three civil rights measures , a fair employment practices bill - introduced in 1947 , several anti-poll tax bills and an anti-lynch bill reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 6 " merely for.the record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out without any recommendation " when it was known that the Senate would recess in fortyeight hours . " The anti-poll tax bills , he added , were buried in Democrat-controlled subcommittees . " It 's a shameful record , " he declared . " It 's part and parcel of the dishonest business of luring votes by promises and then , when you get elected , forgetting them . Of course , if all you want are promises , then vote Democratic . No , doubt the promises will get bigger Iland bigger . Also , I 'm sure the performance will get littler . Has n't the time come for the voters to stop being suckers ?
