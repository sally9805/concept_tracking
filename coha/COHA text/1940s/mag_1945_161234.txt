Encouraged by the resounding success of the Army 's appeal for needed inventions ( TiME , Sept. 6 , 1943 ) , the Navy last week authorized the National Inventors Council to publish a list of 25 naval needs . Some of them : A shockproof , non-parachute aerial delivery container , cheap enough to be thrown away after one drop . A light to mark beaches , which will work on light weight rechargeable batteries , be visible from 5,000 yards at sea . A method of welding light-gauge aluminum , " of particular importance since aluminum lifeboats and rafts are currently of riveted construction due to lack of a satisfactory method of welding . " A chemical fire extinguisher , which , when used around electrical equipment , will not generate phosgene or other poisonous gases . A " non-slipping " shoe sole , " which will give good footing on an oily , steel deck of a ship rolling as much as 17. "
