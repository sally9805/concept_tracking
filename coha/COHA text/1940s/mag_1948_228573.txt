One minute the water was calm . The next , surging waves crashed against the piers , ships rolled at anchor . Then the stooping , kind-faced man leaned forward and pressed a button-and in a few seconds the water was still again . <P> Premier Robert Schuman , who had started and stopped the tempest in the model harbor at the French government 's new hydraulic laboratory at Maisons-Alfort last week , was pleased . " What control ! It 's uncanny , " he remarked . <P> High Winds . A toy storm was pleasant , for a change . All week Robert Schuman had been grappling with man-sized tempests . He badly needed a magic button to press-but nowhere in the jittery , confused National Assembly was there the solid majority which could provide it . <P> His first gale blew up when Socialists suddenly bucked at the idea of firing 150,000 surplus government workers-though Socialists in the Schuman cabinet were committed to the economy . The Premier demanded a vote of confidence and got it , 402-183 ( his ninth in nearly seven months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of his majority seemed almost a promise of sunny weather . <P> But the clouds closed in again . This time it was a group of the Assembly 's rightists , Radicals and Gaullists , who were after the government . They criticized the way the nationalized utilities were being run . When the matter was put to a vote , the government squeaked by , 294-288 . <P> And Schuman could see an even blacker cloud on the immediate horizon . The six-power London agreement to set up a provisional Western German government would soon have to be laid before the Assembly for ratification . The Communists , of course , were against it . Maurice Thorez had already called it " a national disaster . " And General Charles de Gaulle promised a public statement on the subject before the debate began . That De Gaulle would be critical , there was no doubt . If he were violently critical , Radical and rightist deputies would not vote the ratification . <P> Pressure Area . Moreover , there were signs that De Gaulle was stepping up his campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week closeted with aides . While bodyguards-husky youths in gaudy sweaters or black leather jackets - lounged outside the building , De Gaulle issued peremptory orders . <P> " Time presses , " he said . " Every day brings a loss of substance to the nation . Il faut en finir Let 's put an end to it . Parliament must be dissolved . . . and elections held as soon as possible . " <P> As for Robert Schuman , his storms proved more than figurative . On one of his solitary walks among the Left Bank bookstalls he was caught in a cloudburst , returned home drenched . His secretary scolded him . Said Schuman : " I suppose I have too much confidence . " After a pause he added : " In a manner of speaking , of course . "
