The last big chunk of the world 's unchartered airways-the trans-Pacific routes to the Orient-was finally portioned out last week by the Civil Aeronautics Board . Promptly approved by President Truman , the board 's decision will permit air travelers for the first time to go around the world on one ticket . <P> On the beam of its antimonopolistic course in the North Atlantic , CAB turned down Pan American World Airways ' bid to keep the whole Pacific to itself , followed the detailed advice of its examiners ( TIME , Sept. 10 ) to split it up with Northwest Airlines , Inc . Biggest pieces : <P> Northwest will fly the great circle route from New York , Chicago and Seattle via Alaska to Tokyo , Shanghai , Manila and points in eastern China , and in Manchuria , Russia volente . <P> Pan Am will extend its present mid-Pacific routes : 1 ) from Manila to Sagon , Singapore and Batavia ; 2 ) from Midway to Tokyo , Shanghai and Hong Kong ; and 3 ) from Hong Kong via Sagon , Bangkok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its North Atlantic route . <P> Pan Am , still lord of the South Pacific , will thus become the first airline to offer express service from the U.S. around the world ( probable price , around $2,000 ; time , four days or less ) . But even then it will have nothing exclusive . Reason : CAB also extended the North Atlantic route of Trans World Airline from Bombay to Shanghai . There T.W.A. will team up with Northwest to offer a joint one-ticket globe-girdling trip that is 2,000 miles shorter and more complete than Pan Am 's . ( Hustling to get the jump on their new rival , Northwest and T.W.A. announced that they plan to inaugurate the service within three months . ) <P> For Pan Am , CAB included some kind words which said that passengers ' fear of the cold , ice and snow of the north Pacific route and the lure of Hawaii as a way-point in the mid-Pacific route may well give Pan Am the advantage . What it mentioned scarcely at all is that the Northwest Passage will cut the flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Northwest also will do most of its flying overland , where reassuring emergency bases can be built . <P> Considering Pan Am 's big edge in established Pacific facilities , the competitive race of U.S. airlines around the world would be a close one , with no handicaps . <P> <P> * The circuit will be incomplete because Pan Am has no trans-U.S. charter .
