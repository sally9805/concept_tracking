The idyllic landscape above and the luminous nude at the left are recent paintings by the once bitterest satirist in modern German art . In World War I , in which he fought unwillingly-he was a pacifist-Berlin-born George Grosz conceived an emetic loathing for man and all his works . A magazine illustrator in Kaiser Wilhelm 's reign , he turned a ferocious drawing pen on post-war Germany , ripped at its vitals in thousands of drawings that resembled the scrawls of a shell-shocked child . His savage pictures , famed in art circles the world over , showed thick-lipped , cigar-chewing bankers leering at mincingly decrepit prostitutes ; mad-eyed , marble-jawed soldiers fighting crazily in corpse-strewn ruins ; scrofulous , consumptive veterans ( see cut , opposite page ) coughing out pointless lives amid degeneration and squalor . Of all Germany 's " degenerate " artists , Nazis numbered him first . In 1932 , despite his " Aryan " birth , Satirist Grosz wisely fled to the U.S. He became a citizen , got a Guggenheim Fellowship and a job teaching at Manhattan 's Art Students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirers : his scratching pen gave way to an affectionate , romantic paintbrush . In lush , vibrant color , curling brush strokes that recalled Van Gogh 's , he painted sunclean , little nudes in airy land scapes , glowing dunes and beaches of health and optimism . From the painter of Germany 's grim , Gothic , post-war Walpurgisnacht , George Grosz was converted in the U.S. to a German lyricist celebrating love and nature with the old-time fervor of a Franz Schubert . Now he confesses : " I had been too nervous , too vain , too ambitious , now I can sit in the dunes and feel humble and shy and say a little prayer . " <P> Today dapper , slick-haired George Grosz spends his time , between teaching jobs in Manhattan , with an amiable wife and two strapping sons , in a pleasant waterside home at Douglaston , L.I . A systematic painter , who works long hours , his favorite hobby is carpentry . He can not pass a hardware store without buying a saw . Only holdover from his macabre past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
