The hopes of two revolutions were near death in Mexico last week . The U. S. had sounded the end of both , appointing Vice President-elect Henry Agard Wallace as " special representative with the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary " to the Presidential inauguration in Mexico City Dec. 1 ( see p. 14 ) . When President-elect General Manuel Avila Camacho takes office on that day with the blessing of the U. S. , retiring President Lazaro Crdenas ' revolutionary Six-Year Plan will be over , the promised revolt of President-reject General Juan Andreu Almazn will be left as flat as a tortilla . <P> Mexico 's press reported Almazanismo dying in a flurry of blood and violence and trickery . Four Almazanistas said they had been arrested and tortured by Federal soldiers . More Almazn followers fled out of Rio Verde and San Luis Potosi to avoid persecutions of local caciques . Seora Higinia Cedillo Gonzales , who helped her brother , General Saturnino Cedillo , revolt and tried to do the same for Almazn , was reported kidnapped or murdered . Government men ransacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lopez . <P> Then the Government 's PRM ( Party of the Mexican Revolution ) came out with a fantastic story , which Almazan denied , of a Nazi-backed Almazanista plot to overthrow the Government . From a pile of swastika-sprinkled documents it said it had decoded papers accounting for 12,000 cases of ammunition and eight knocked down planes , smuggled in off a Nazi freighter . Maps were produced showing Almazanista military centres and broadcasting stations . Almazan 's strength was put at 250,000 men under onetime Labor Boss Luis M. Morones , backed by a Nazi warship and 14 more planes . Police uncovered plans to cut off the capital 's power , light and communications as a signal for armed attacks on the Presidential Palace and key public buildings . <P> Next day Almazanistas ambushed five Federal agents investigating the plot , killed two of them . The Government countered by starting a roundup of Almazanista leaders , jailed 100 within 48 hours . <P> More peacefully , but as relentlessly as geometry , the closing circle of Mexican politics was choking off the revolution of Crdenas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first non-militaristic Government . He began putting his dreams of Utopia into effect by redistributing land to the peasants , nationalizing the railroads , expropriating foreign oil concessions . But his espousal of the little man brought the full power of the militaristic Right against him . As he fought off the Right the militant Left crept in behind him . Vicente Lombardo Toledano , secretary of the CTM ( Confederation of Mexican Workers ) , began pumping Communism into the administration . <P> As the Left grew stronger with armed CTM and peasants ' militias it became lefter still . Crdenas ' fine dream began to tarnish . Workers started squabbling among themselves . The oil expropriations became a white elephant at home , upset Mexico 's international relations . Chicanery as well as well-meaning incompetence shackled Crdenas ' visionary plans .
