A new series of government posters sprouted last week on British hoardings , on the walls of blitzed buildings and behind the bars of village pubs . The series portrayed " Our National Heritage " with pictures of historical heroes-always bracketed with a companion picture of Winston Churchill . Political observers saw a certain significance : a newly glamorized Conservative Party digging in at the sources of political power . <P> The new Toryism asks Britons to entrust their future , as they had entrusted their great past , to individualism and private enterprise . Last week Tory Oliver Lyttelton , onetime metals magnate and now Minister of Production , told the Aldershot Conservative Assn. : " The great periods of our history were nearly always associated with an outstanding individual and not with a political system . We think of Queen Elizabeth , and Sir Francis Drake , or Marlborough , Pitt and Nelson and of the Duke of Wellington ; and it is on the ability to keep alive the spirit of adventure and to inject into public opinion new , fanciful and unorthodox ideas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ghastly than a uniform cowlike public opinion which is left willing to browse on artificially fertilized fields and chew the cud of common pasture . . . . " <P> Tails Up . The Tories had something , and they knew it . Their tails were up , and they were romping all around the pasture . They had the bulk of Britain 's private wealth . They controlled virtually all civilian war industries and Government boards . They had the ablest men in public life , ran the smoothest party organization . Now Winston Churchill could take a hero 's modest bow for the victories in North Africa , and his Party shared the political rewards . <P> If errors and ineptitudes had been fatal , the Conservative Party would have died in 1939 and 1940 . But the Tories survived and thrived . Early in 1942 , when Socialist Sir Stafford Cripps emerged as the white hope of a new deal , the Tories took him into the Government and then swallowed him up . Now Sir Stafford was useful to them . Last week , as Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Government 's seizure of inefficient Short Brothers , Ltd . ( Sunderland flying boats , Stirling bombers ) . <P> This arbitrary proceeding raised a rumpus in Britain , but the Government 's reasons were sound , and the Tories turned the incident to their political advantage . In effect , the Government demonstrated that it was placing national interest above that of private enterprise , took the sting from recent indications that Tory M.P.s were not interested in social reforms . <P> Heads Down . The Labor Party is in humdrum contrast . It has only a few able men , a lukewarm , badly battered Socialist program . Labor 's representation in the House consists mostly of ultraconservative unionists , of the type which long ago inspired the crack , " Commons is Labor 's House of Lords . " <P> When the war began , Labor joined the Liberals and Tories in a coalition Government . Now the Party is thoroughly enmeshed in the coalition web . Apparently , the Laborites are afraid to test their voting strength by ending the political truce which has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
