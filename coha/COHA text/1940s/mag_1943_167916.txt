MR . JUSTICE HOLMES-Francis Biddle - Scribner ( $2.50 ) . <P> One day in 1911 Mr. Justice Holmes of the U.S. Supreme Court welcomed a new secretary just out of Harvard Law School . " My son , " said Holmes , " my philosophy is divided into two parts , each equally important : the first-keep your bowels open ; and the second-well , the second is somewhat more complex and a part of your duties is to hear it during the next nine months . " <P> The secretary so humanly addressed was young Francis Biddle of the Philadelphia Biddies , now U.S. Attorney General . He has made an offering in the form of a biography to the memory of the man he thinks may come to rank with Washington , Franklin , Jefferson , Lincoln . Biddle 's vivid sketching reinforces a central impression of Holmes also to be had from the monumental Holmes-Pollock Letters ( TIME , April 14 , 1941 ) - that this giant of U.S. law will ultimately be valued as a phenomenally warm , wise , skeptical , humble human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerson , Lowell , Dana and others at the Saturday Club in Boston sat down one evening with a new novel The Sun Also Rises , by a new author , Ernest Hemingway . Wrote he to the friend who had sent the book , Owen Wister : <P> " It is singular . An account of eating and drinking with a lot of fornication accompanied by conversations on the lowest level , with some slight intelligence but no ideas , and nothing else-and yet it seems a slice of life , and you are not bored with details of an ordinary day . It reminds me of a reflection that I often make on how large a part of the time and thoughts of even the best of us are taken up by animal wants . ... But then this lad could write this book , which must be a work of art . It ca n't be accident and naivete . So let him survive . ... " <P> To a nation at war , Holmes has eloquent things to say . He was no stranger to war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1861 , with his eyes glued to the pages of Hobbes 's Leviathan which he had just borrowed from the Athenaeum , he felt a touch on his shoulder . " Holmes , " a friend said , " you 've got your first lieutenant 's commission in the Twentieth . " Holmes returned the copy of Leviathan , went off to war and a wound in the throat at Antietam . " As he grew older , " writes Biddle , " the thought of war came to mean ... a selfless surrender of individual comfort and ambition to some mystic faith that drew brave men together . " Said Holmes in a Memorial Day address : <P> " In this snug , over-safe corner of the world we need it war , that we may realize that our comfortable routine is no eternal necessity of things , but merely a little space of calm in the midst of the tempestuous untamed streaming of the world . . . . High and dangerous action teaches us to believe as right beyond dispute things for which our doubting minds are slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in the worth of heroism . "
