What will guide the guided missile ? Radio waves are dangerous . The enemy also has radios ; he might suborn the brainless invader into a rightabout turn . " Homing " devices , attracted by some quality of the target , are dangerous if used prematurely . The missile , perhaps confused by the enemy , might " home " on a friendly city . The earth 's magnetic field is a poor guide . It varies erratically , and a subtle enemy might bemuse the missile with false-face magnetism . What is needed for a really effective guided missile is a foolproof steering device that the enemy can not influence . <P> Last week Charles A. McPheeters , of the Navy 's Bureau of Aeronautics , told a little about one such device now under development : a gadget that watches stars like a human navigator and steers the missile by them . It identifies the proper stars ( from one to three ) by measuring their brightness or their " color temperature . " Then , guided by their relation to one another or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missile on its predetermined course . <P> This guiding method , said Mr. McPheeters , will probably be used during the middle leg of the missile 's voyage of destruction . Just after the take-off from friendly territory it can safely be guided by simpler means such as radio . When it finally nears the target , a homing device may take over .
