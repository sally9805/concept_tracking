In U.N . ' s pressroom last week , a telling diplomatic exchange took place . On their bulletin board , correspondents discovered a notice charging that some members of the press posed as delegates in order to get comfortable rides home in delegation cars . The offenders were requested to refrain from such tactics . Within ten minutes a retaliatory notice appeared : " It has come to the attention of the U.N . Correspondents Association that some delegates have been posing as reporters in order to ascertain what is going on in some committees . This practice must stop . . . . "
