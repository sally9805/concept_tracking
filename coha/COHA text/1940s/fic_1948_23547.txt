THE PURIFICATION OF THELMA A UGENSTERN A Story VICTOR WOLFSON T HELMA AUGENSTERN stood in the middle of her enormous living room and surveyed the rich expanse , turning first in one direction toward the mirrored dining room , then in the other toward the library . She was forty-nine years old , short and thin , and had the face of an eagle  --  an eagle shrunken , preserved in acids of anxiety and insincerity ; grown juiceless , yet appearing fierce still in a harmless , almost amusing way . She wore a tan velvet evening gown  --  more like an expensive sack than a dress . The shoulder straps were covered with rhinestones and beneath the hem the high-heeled slippers sparkled in what Thelma was aware of as an echoing note . Her face was ashen . Her clipped hair , straight and iron-gray , hung down on either side of her face from a path in her scalp , like an Indian 's . She resembled , a little , an Aztec clay figure . It was just before eight o'clock , the Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to dinner would be arriving at any moment . Her new husband ? they had been married scarcely four months  --  had been gone for an hour . He was calling for Avis Halliday who lived alone in a nearby hotel on Madison Avenue . Thelma had invited twenty people , the elite of their circle , to come in afterward at about ten o'clock . Several had thoughtit odd , had put it down to Thelma 's mild eccentricity that she should be having one of her evenings so soon after the large and splendid party over which she had reigned on New Year 's Eve . Most of them had accepted the invitation . T HE strange form which this Tuesday night gathering was to take had come to Thelma four days before , during a luncheon which she had had with her old friend Bessie Baumgard . The luncheon had taken place on New Year 's Day . Thelma had arrived early at the restaurant to find a message stating that her friend would be late . Thelma sat down alone amidst the empty , white-clothed tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her party the night before , but largely from a quickened sense of the futility of her life which no party , no activity seemed capable , any longer , of shaking off . It seemed to Thelma that her condition had been aggravated by New Year 's  --  one of those dreadful demarcations of time which made her doubly aware of the emptiness in and toward which she moved . Thelma smoked a cigarette . It seemed to steady her , and in the quiet , glistening restaurant , she had found herself thinking a little of her life . " Divorce again . . . it 's ridiculous . . ) , She had twice been married and di-vorced , had married for a third time and faced now another divorce . Not that she had given Lathrop an inkling of what was in her mind . Only Bessie Baumgard knew . " Something , " Thelma thought grimly as she mashed out the cigarette after a few puffs , " must be very wrong with me still . " She had been through several long and bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciple of Gurdiev , of D. H. Lawrence , of Jung , had tried Bahai , and had recently returned from a visit with Gerald Heard . Nothing had helped . " An empty pod . . . I am simply an empty pod , " Thelma said to herself , smiling , flicking an ash from the plump napkin on the table . She admitted defeat at last . She could attach importance to nothing , try as she might ; neither to the state of the world , nor to literature or art , nor to politics . From time to time she had affected zeal for various causes like " Free India " or " Aid to Political Refugees . " She had plunged also into fights against censorship and the suppression of civil liberties . But at bottom it had all been gesturing , the passion pretended . Int the acceptance of defeat Thelma was quick , almost eager to admit that she had failed too at every serious human relationship . Only a kind of limited friendship dimly flourished ; with a few men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they had shared childhood summer days on family estates around Lake Saranac . Or with several classmates like Bessie Baumgard , whom she had known at the Benjamin Littauer School of Music , where they both had studied the piano long ago . Several times , with the aid of her various husbands , she had swung out of this childhood circle into a vaster world where she experienced a certain nervous activity , and uneasiness , which she had thought of at first as the rich , full life . But she returned after the divorces with relief to the original sphere , only to find herself increasingly unhappy and discontented . Her first husband , Marshal Albright , after three years of marriage had as much as told her in a fit of sadistic hysteria ( which Thelma had brought on ) that he had married her for her money . The Augensterns had always had enormous wealth and it blighted all their relationships , causing the Augensterns to be suspicious of every new person they met and to question every gesture of affection made toward them . Thelma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was a thin flame burning feebly behind a shield of gold . Albright had been a writer , an editor of an avant-garde literary magazine . He was younger than she by some five years and was a drunkard , but considered by everyone to be talented and charming . It was he who had first brought Thelma out of her mother 's massive West End Avenue apartment , in 1923 , and had introduced her to the bohemian life . Thelma Augenstern , who at one time or another since then , had taken " a little house " in Capri , Taxco , Truro , Juan-les-Pins , New City , Taos , Majorca , Rockport , Acapulco , Sneden 's Landing , had never quite got over it . Her second husband , Duncan Oliver , was an art dealer , an ambiguous man , at once cruel and generous , sweet and passionate , with , unfortunately for Thelma , a passion which extended to several of his younger painters . These young men would be at the apartment continually , or during the summer Thelma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them on the estate at Saranac ( which she had inherited finally from her mother ) . Once she had traveled for a whole year through Mexico and Guatemala with Duncan and one of his painters . " Stupid , stupid . . . " she said to herself , pulling the brim of her hat lower to shade her eyes from the glare of the chandelier , " what a stupid woman they must have thought me . . . " And now there was Lathrop Hyde . Marshal , Duncan , and Lathrop  --  always these fine-sounding names evoking visions of stalwart , clear-eyed , pure-hearted men . " Why have I never been attracted to a Joe or a George or a Dave . . . no , no , never a Dave . . . " Thelma had turned quickly away from this reflection and gazed across the empty tables thinking that indeed the only peace she had known recently was that which she experienced by arriving early in a fine restaurant , before the vibrant hush was shattered . " It 's like surveying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat and cozy Bessie Baumgard when at last she arrived . " I feel like Eve in the Garden . " A s Thelma Augenstern stood surveying her own Garden four days later , on that Tuesday evening just before eight o'clock , she was struck with a vague apprehension . The yellow chrysanthemums in the tall silver vases were tightly curled and potent , the cushions on the sofas and chairs were fluffed and gleaming , the air was clear , the lamps glowing . Every object , from the cakes of scented soap in the bathrooms to the clean crystal ash-trays , seemed to be waiting . The great apartment was ready once again , as it had been a few days before on New Year 's Eve  --  and oh , how many times before that ! ? virginal , poised to receive guests , laughter , flirtations , clutter , viciousness , cigarette smoke , the clink of glasses , the stains , the butts , the burns . Thelma knew defilement was to be the destiny of her lovely garden , as , she thought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own life . What she had realized at the luncheon with Bessie Baumgard  --  it had brought about the strange resolution she had felt since then  --  was that during all of her marriages , throughout the years of bohemia , of travel , of the search for life and experience in high places and in low , her sense of purity and innocence had been continuously outraged . Her descents into various underworlds in Mexico and in Europe , her fabricated interest in abnormalities and perversities , even her intelligent chatter about art , literature , and music had been an attempt to hide from herself the frightful condition of the structure in which she dwelled . She saw it now as a hollow and lofty ruin , fragmented , complicated , full of moral twists and turnings , of double dealings and intrigue , with secret passages of corruption branching off everywhere  --  a crazy wreck , unrelated to any purpose , idea or belief . Thelma thought of herself now as wandering in the surrounding rubble with half the world , with withered men and women staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost the power to feel deeply about anything ; neither justice , nor honor , nor love or work or sex . Passion for these things had seeped away like blood from a mortally wounded creature . Only dry clot remained in the soul . Her world , she had once remarked to an ambassador she found sitting next to her at some dinner , was a reflection of that larger political universe in which it existed . A nasty little tumor within an enormous cancer , Thelma had remarked to the startled statesman . The fact of the matter was that at the center of the insincere coil Thelma was the proper , tidy , decent , bourgeois West End Avenue girl , still . Lusty Bessie Baumgard at luncheon had told her that it was nobody 's God-damned business how many times she had been or was going to be divorced . And Thelma had readily agreed with her . Yet she could not help feeling that it was the business of that shocked girl , the sensitive , talented , hopeful Miss Augenstern , student of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was listening to every word of their conversation . What seemed to Thelma so incredible at that moment before the arrival of her guests was that she still persisted in her resolve to thwart the trampling of her garden . She was determined to purify herself at last . She had thought that the resolution would have lost its power , would have been , dissipated in the activity of succeeding days and in the preparation for the dinner and the gathering afterward ; in the purchase of flowers , the selection of wines , in the bathing and the dressing . But no , none of the compelling attractiveness of the idea had diminished . It had indeed been heightened , for Lathrop had been gone for a whole hour , to fetch a young woman who lived just around the corner . The doorbell must have rung at last . She heard voices in the hall . Thelma Augenstern fixed a smile upon her small , sad face and went out to greet her guests . II T HE theater in America is . . . com- ment dit-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . THE PURIFICATION OF THELMA AUGENSTERN 257 " He has been in America for twenty years , " the Princess announced listlessly , laying her fork down for a moment . " You would think he would speak without resorting to French , which he does not know anyhow . " " Oui ! C'est vrai ! N'est-ee pas ? " the Prince shot back impishly at his wife , an aloof , withdrawn woman . She looked out at the world from enormous Byzantine eyes with an expression of weary defeat as if to say , " What is there that anyone can do now to rescue me , or even divert me ? " The Prince was laughing , throwing back his head and opening his mouth so that Thelma could see the pink roof and somewhere within a single gleam of gold . Hearing the accent of their voices in the midst of our American tones , Thelma thought as she fingered the stem of the wine glass , is like coming upon a mysterious oasis in the midst of a glaring desert . After she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , and a little atmosphere of uneasiness immediately closed down upon the table . Was it the ornate cluster of words which she always seemed to choose , or was it the studied manner in which they dropped out of her mouth which always dampened spontaneity and caused self-consciousness to sprout in the ensuing silences ? For a moment the small dinner party sitting in the glow of candle-light , and reflected three times in the three mirrored walls of the dining room , was still . " I think American voices are disgusting , " Avis Halliday finally said . " Oh , I do n't know , " Lathrop said , his glistening , chubby face looking excessively earnest and a little peevish ; " is there anything lovelier than a voice from Virginia , for instance ? Or anything more cultivated than a true Bostonian accent ? It 's the New York voice that 's so deadly . And everybody knows New York is not America ? " and he added , " thank God . " Thelma , across the table , smiled at her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile the old panic had swiftly risen . Had she been attacked ? So many of her race lived in New York , in her city . Did he mean . .. well , how could she ever know ? They were always so subtle , these people of this world , these Marshals , these Duncans , these Lathrops . . . " I 'm from Atlanta . Georgia , originally , " Avis Halliday said , " but you would n't believe it now , would you ? " " New York corrupts , that we know for certain , " the Prince announced brightly . " That is why everybody loves it so , " the Princess concluded while the others laughed . T HELMA watched Avis Halliday , whom she had seated between the Prince and Lathrop . She was a large handsome woman in her early thirties . Her oval face was flushed and several strands of blonde hair had escaped her coiffure adding excitement , a kind of childish abandon to the rich personality . Her white gown draped easily over her breasts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were having some trouble with it . She laughed , turning from Lathrop to the Prince and back again , fingering the strap meanwhile . She seemed to be welcoming them to an intimate view of the tiresome problems of her female world , of which the difficult shoulder strap was but one example . There were others , she seemed to suggest , far more complicated and interesting and amusing . She was an old friend of Lathrop 's , an interior architect she called herself , and since Lathrop was a successful builder of apartment houses this mutual interest was not difficult to comprehend . She " did " all his lobbies for him in brilliant tones , attempting to fight the melancholy hush which the architecture itself imposed . Thelma had supposed that before their marriage , Avis had been Lathrop 's mistress . A month after their marriage , when Thelma had finally asked the gnawing question , he had told her that her supposition was quite , quite correct . " Why then , " Thelma had thought at the time , " has he married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , more than four years older than Lathrop . It ca n't be that he loves me , I do not expect love , no perhaps affection , companionship , a little loyalty -- the things easily available . But can I return them ? Perhaps , we shall see . But why has he married me ? What does he see in me ? " The question had doomed this marriage as it had the others from the moment it was raised . W HETHER because of her character , or because of the set of experiences through which she , and indeed her entire age , had passed , Thelma could not imagine herself to be of much value in herself  --  not essentially . She was always amused by the quotations she read in the papers from time to time as to what price the human being would bring on the open market in terms of fat , calcium , phosphorus , and nitrogen . Why should a human being be valued at all , she had recently asked herself . Was not this notion a sentimental , half-baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there in anyone that could rightfully demand a place of importance in the world in which she lived , except as he represented this or that thing which her world considered important  --  position , opportunity , the satisfaction of appetite , power , prestige , wealth . . . these were the equivalents of the fat , the calcium , phosphorus , and nitrogen , and these they all understood . The rest was mystical slush . What , then , did Lathrop see in her ? Money ? He has money . Well , then he could always use more . The ever-present question had often goaded her into nasty , oblique quarrels , especially with her former husbands who had been poor . She hoped they might inadvertently , in a fury , answer the question ( as Albright had ) , exposing themselves , leaving her triumphant , clutching the foul knowledge . In her quarrels with Lathrop , however , the replies were never satisfactory , and she tried herself to answer the question in a jumble of psychoanalytic jargon : " You married me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You married me because you are a Gentile and I am a Jew , and something within me calls out to be beaten by you . I evoke it by my face , my body , my name , the way in which I move . . . /5 " You recognize in me the deep drive toward death . In me , in my race , the dark death instinct is piteously exposed . You can not resist being drawn to it  --  none of you can  --  and yet you hate it . . . . " And much more . But not even these answers satisfied her . Actually Lathrop had married Thelma because Avis , not loving him , had refused to marry him . Lathrop had turned in mild defeat from the vigorous younger woman , to the more cultivated and sensitive older woman , who was attractive in her own polished way , with a fund of bitter wit and sharp perceptivity , gracious , seemingly poised , oddly distinguished looking , and who was extremely well connected in circles which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . He had had no intention of returning to Avis when he married . It was Thelma who through constant application of the self-destroying question , had driven him back , and Avis , having affection for Lathrop and a good business head , had accepted him . S 1TTING opposite Thelma across the dinner table , Lathrop saw how intently his wife was regarding Avis . " She seems to know , " he thought , " that we are together again . Well , too bad . Ca n't be helped . I tried . God knows I tried . " " Lathrop , " Thelma suddenly said , turning to him and smiling benevolently , as though to suggest that there was no need for him to disguise the fact that he had been looking at her for a long time . She had known it , the small smile said , and she had been waiting for him to finish summing up the situation for himself before turning and possibly interrupting his thought . " Lathrop , " she said , " I lunched with Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil ? " Lathrop thought . It was strange to him , as it was to the guests at the thrice reflected table , that Thelma should suddenly insert this personal note . They sat back in their chairs , smiling vacantly , waiting for Thelma to proceed . Avis Halliday picked up a crumb and dropped it into an ash-tray . ( They were between salad and dessert . ) " Yes ? " said Lathrop . " What of it ? " " She says you and I must be divorced , " Thelma replied , pursing her lips in a wise and mysterious smile . ( How like a small THE PURIFICATION OF THELMA AUGENSTERN 259 Aztec figure she looked in the candlelight ? the black slightly protruding eyes , the pinched face , the curious inward smile , the severe cut of the hair . ) " Do you think divorce would help  --  whatever it is that ails me ? " she smiled . " Has she lost her mind ? " Lathrop asked himself . " No , it 's only that she knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , dear , " Avis Halliday thought , fussing with her shoulder strap , " there 's going to be a scene . This is that change of life business . . . . " " Divorce ? ! " the Prince laughed ; " yes , yes , divorce , that is the one way out for people nowadays , yes Natascha ? It will cure everything , they think , including bunions ! " His merry blue eyes looked at each of them , asking for approval . " Have I not saved this embarrassing little situation for you ? " they seemed to say . " Now , please , somebody carry on from here . I have done my bit . " " Divorce , " Lathrop said lightly , laughing , " well , perhaps we must . " " Listen to these men , Thelma , " the Princess said in a mocking , scolding tone , " they are always willing . " " Who will make me a virgin again ? " Thelma said quietly , smiling . " Who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Allow me ? ! " the Prince cried playfully , leaping from his seat and kneeling down before Thelma like a little knight , a role which he found , and in which he was , very appealing . Thelma , ignoring the Prince , stared at the others at the table who had turned toward each other laughing , and continued with sweet solemnity : " Will love burn away the incrustation and expose the ancient jewel once more ? " And again the others laughed . " And where will one find love with this potency any longer , when the ore itself has been exhausted ? " " Beppe , " the Princess said suddenly to her husband , " do n't be a fool ! Get up ! " The Prince , on his knees , looked up in surprise . " My dear Thelma ? " Lathrop said , with an embarrassed , superior smile on his face . " And even so , " Thelma said , cutting him off , speaking it seemed without consciousness , mindless , in a driving soft monotone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I can no longer love myself ? " The Prince , deflated and bewildered , rose to his feet with a foolish grin on his face , shrugged his shoulders , though no one was looking at him , and sat down at the table again . " And even so , " Thelma went on , " can love bear the whole burden . . ? Everything must change and who will start ? " No one answered . The guests simply sat in startled mortification and waited for something to happen , someone to rescue them . " We are in the final cul de sac and no one knows how to turn back or how to break out . . . . Do n't you think this is true , Lathrop ? " And she added , " Do n't you ? " Thelma 's voice had risen sharply , accusingly on this last , and she looked about , shattered and confused , at each of her guests as though she had not expected this to happen . " I hate the human race , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb is the salvation of the world . We deserve to be wiped out of the garden we have dirtied . " Then , in a strange , unreal , piercing voice , she cried : " Make room ! Make room for something better ! " " Hear ! hear ! " Lathrop suddenly shouted mockingly , " Job speaks ! " His eyes had a narrow , fierce light in them , but his mouth laughed . " All this Goddamned Ethical Culture stuff ! " he said . " Is there anything worse ? " he asked the guests gathered miserably at the table , speaking only to them , as though they were his comrades under attack , " is there anything worse than Jewish Puritanism ? " T HE maids came in and began to clear away the table . An anxious , intense expression covered their features . They went through the familiar motions quickly , nervously . The course of the dinner seemed suddenly to have stopped . No one had pressed the buzzer under the carpet and they were bewildered , frightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must he destroyed , " Thelma suddenly said out of the silence , " and you , Lathrop , you most of all with your dull , pretentious Park Avenue buildings which house such ? " Avis Halliday rose quickly from the table . " Excuse me , " she muttered and hurried from the room . " For God 's sake , Thelma , what is the matter with your ' " Oh , I knew it all along . But for shame ? fondling that poor girl in my bedroom on New Year 's Eve . Oh , I saw it , I 'm sorry but I did . Oh , I do n't blame her , nor even you , really . I blame myself , only myself . " The maids left the room in consternation and the sound of a giggle , strangled in mid-utterance , trailed back into the silent dining room . Suddenly Thelma lifted her shrunken eagle face and snorted : " Marshal , Duncan , Lathrop . . haha .. . haha ! How I fell into the traps ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife in Russian . " Be quiet , idiot , " she replied in Russian . Then in English she said : " Come , my dear Thelma , you must lie down awhile . " " And even Princes come to the house , " Thelma shouted derisively , thrusting the Princess ' hand from her arm , " Princes come to Thelma Augenstern 's house ! " She made fun of her own name , weighting it with a thick German accent . " Everybody comes here . " Her voice dropped abruptly , and she continued in an almost Hebraic sing-song , " the whole world comes here , but I do not know them . They sit at my table , but I do not know them . I see them with my outside eyes , but I do not know them . They use me and I do not know them . They use me and I do not know who it is that is using mc . I do not know myself . I do not know who I am , what I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lathrop thought , standing up . " For God 's sake , what shall I do ! " Aloud he said brightly , " Let 's all go into the next room , shall we ? " " Yes , yes . . " Thelma agreed , not stirring from her seat ; " all your friends will be arriving at any moment . " " They 're your friends too , Thelma ? " She shook her head like a child . " I know no one . " " Excuse me , " Lathrop said . He was determined to call a doctor , one of her former analysts perhaps . " Pour yourself a drink , Beppe , " he called as he left the room , " the brandy 's on the sideboard . " Thelma simply sat as before . She reached for a gob of candle wax flowing down and threatening to stain her table cloth . " I should have asked another man for dinner , " she said , rolling the wax between her fingers nervously , " but I did not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long . " She smiled strangely at the Princess . " Lathrop was very angry earlier this evening because of it . . . nevertheless he did take an hour to call for Avis Halliday . " She turned away from the wax in her fingers and peered suddenly into the Princess ' dark , oval , Byzantine eyes . " Poor Princess , " she said smiling faintly , with compassion , " we are both doubly exiled . " to Prince leapt from his seat , went to the mirrored sideboard and brought a thick crystal decanter back to the table . He emptied his water glass into that of his wife 's . Some of it spilled on the cloth and the Princess began blotting it up with her napkin , muttering angrily meanwhile , in Russian . The Prince poured himself half a tumbler of brandy . He had decided the dinner was over . The kitchen had stopped functioning . The maids were never coming back . " Excuse me , " Thelma said , pushing her chair back from the table . She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the Prince and the Princess sitting before the debris . Thelma crossed her fresh , unsullied drawing room and went out into the hall . She had caught a glimpse of Lathrop in the library , telephoning . She went upstairs to the bedroom floor of the apartment . As she passed her own bedroom , she saw for a moment , Avis Halliday applying lipstick before the brilliantly lighted mirror . Thelma continued down the hall and went into Lathrop 's bedroom . She hurried across the soft carpet to the wide glass doors behind the curtains . She opened the doors and stepped out on to the snow-covered terrace . It was dark and piercingly cold . Thelma J'OUVRE LEN'fliMENT was conscious of snow melting in the toe of her slipper . The hum and muffled clatter of the city , her city , rose up around her . " Oh , my city , " she said softly , " oh , fretful sleeper . . . turning , calling out , slumbering again . . . " There were no stars ; only below was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrace , and Thelma knew that the after-dinner guests were now assembling in her drawing room . She climbed up onto a tub containing a deadlilac bush and stood for a moment upon the little circle of frozen , snow-covered earth . " Am I really doing this ? " she thought , " Is it really me ? " and stepped up onto the concrete parapet which surrounded the terrace . The wind blew her dress and her hair , and she loomed upon the dark perch Iike some enormous migratory bird , resting in its long flight . There was a noise behind her and startled , she dived , dropping heavily and swiftly down , toward the light . j'ouvre Lentement To E. E.
