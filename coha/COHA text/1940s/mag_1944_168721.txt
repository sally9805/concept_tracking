An unarmed , national strike drove President Jorge Ubico , Tyrant of Guatemala , from office last week . <P> Students began the movement , but it quickly spread through the population . <P> Shopkeepers closed their doors . Railroad workers quit . The people used little or no violence , for this was a strike of " brazos caids " ( " arms down " ) . The life of long terrorized Guatemala slowed to a deathly standstill . <P> Ubico used plenty of violence . His police and soldiers ranged the capital , threatening , killing . But the strike did not lose force . Day by day , like a fangless constrictor , it tightened its coils around the encircled tyrant . <P> After a week or so , the tyrant yielded slightly and fired his strongest supporter , General David H. Ordoez , head of his Gestapo . The people were not appeased : they were after Ubico himself . At last , after twelve days , he handed his resignation to Congress , begged that his person and wealth be spared , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico City , Ubico delegated his power to a military junta . But the people wanted real self-government ; they had at least a chance to start their climb toward democracy . <P> Two to Go . Ubico 's downfall reduced the " Dictators ' Club " of Central America to half its former membership . Dictator Maximiliano Hernndez Martnez of El Salvador fell last May before a popular strike which set the pattern for Guatemala . The two survivors , Dictator Tiburcio Caras of Honduras and Dictator Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua , were seriously threatened by the wave of unarmed strikes sweeping Latin America . <P> Big-bellied Caras , elected President of Honduras in 1932 , twice extended his term without elections . Several times he put down revolts , left his prisons full of political enemies in spite of petitions from other Latin countries . Now he faced a growing storm of popular rebellion . Across the border of newly freed El Salvador , Honduran exiles were eagerly crowding , filling the free Salvadoran press with at tacks upon him . <P> " Tacho " Somoza of Nicaragua also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week he suppressed a demonstration of students and citizens by shooting a few and arresting over 200 . Across the Costa Rican border waited thousands of Nicaraguans , eager for a chance to invade their own country . Last week Dictator Somoza received 18 Lend-Lease airplanes from the U.S. They may aid him militarily , but can not help him against the non-violent but powerful pressure of a brazos cados strike .
