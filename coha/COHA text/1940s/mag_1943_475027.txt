organization of Chinese boys and girls ? students in uni. sabotage against the Japanese occupying forces w China . campaign . At the time of the first episode recounted here , pplies but had not attempted any killings. ? The Editors IN THE first Monday of May , 1939 , we had one of our regular weekly meetings . Everybody at the meet-ing reported the general conditions of the past week and problems were discussed . Almost at the end of the meeting Fan stood up , her face calm and full of confi-dence . I knew she was going to make an important proposal . " My department has found out all the important information about traitor Wong Wu-teh who was the head of the adminis-tration department of the puppet govern-ment of Peiping . He goes to his office every morning at nine o'clock . His car is black . The number is 38377 . " She stopped for a moment to see our reaction . We were very serious about what she was saying . Then she contin-ued , " He has only one bodyguard because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this old peaceful city . It will be very easy for us to send him back to his old home if two or three of our comrades wait for him at the turn of 37th Road at the right time , as his driver uses the same route every day . Do you consider that this is a aood opportunity for us ? " " Yes , but we have had no experience in doing this kind of job , " Kao answered . " I wish to do this work if the meeting will give the order , " I said . " You arc not going to do it , " Kao replied . " We do n't want to sacrifice any one of our members , for Wong Wu-teh has a guard and you have no experience . " " But we ca n't let our opportunity go ! " I said . " Why ca n't we hire some gangsters and let them do the work ? " suggested Chang . " A good idea , but how can we get in touch with them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fan said . " That is easy , " Chang answered . " I know they always stay in Jap opium shops for days or even for weeks . We can easily find them there . We can let them use our revolvers and pay them five hundred dollars when they have clone their job . " " We have n't that amount of money , " someone said . " Well , we can collect it from our members , " prompted Chang . " It does not mean everyone should pay in a certain amount but only arrnrciina to his own will . We have so many members it should be very easy to get this amount if everyone contributes one or two dollars . Is this agreeable to you ? " " Yes , " we answered . The decision was then made . I was appointed to help Chang with the job , that is , to find some gunmen . II SET off in the evening for some Japs ' opium shops . We had to pretend to be opium smokers , . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . We could not go into an opium shop and not smoke . We were surprised to learn later that after one entered an opium shop there were waiters to serve smokers . They did all the work ; the only thing left for one to do was to smoke . It was about nine o'clock in the evening and the streets were quiet , for the shops and stores were all closed . This was the usual state of things since the Japs had occupied Peiping . Under the weak street lights we walked along many turns and sharp curves in a small lane . There was no sound and no noise at all except the dogs who generally bark at strangers . We found a small house . On each side of the door was some poorly written Chinese : " Here is the ideal place to smoke , " on one side , and " Beautiful girls , " on the other . We knocked at the door . A middleaged Jap opened it . He bowed to us and then said , " Welcome , master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was so dark we could scarcely see anything . There were only two lamps . Each one gave a light like a candle . The whole room was filled with beds . Smokers were on the beds smoking , each one with a small oil lamp to burn his opium . It was here we noticed that there were servants who burned the opium for you while you smoked . The smell of opium made us dizzy . We almost started to cough , but we had to control it because it would show that we were not opium smokers . The kind middle-aged Jap invited us to lie on one of the empty beds . Only in their opium shops if you smoked andpaid cash could you have found the Japs so friendly with you . I looked but could not see any gangsters there . So I said to the Jap , " We came to join Mr. Wu but he is not here ; we had better go to find him somewhere else . Please excuse us . " The Jap did not show any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Please come back when you find Mr. Wu . " Then we walked out and he closed the door . Outside the room we both took a deep breath . The odor had made us feel so sick and dizzy that the ground was moving around us . We managed to walk off after a few seconds . We tried another shop ? still no good , and then a third one . Finally we found a gangster in the fourth one . This one was much better equipped and had private smoking rooms . There we found a slim man dressed in dark gray . We could tell by his face that he was undoubtedly a smart gunman . He occupied a double room and left one bed empty , so we got a chance to talk with him . " Good evening , brother , may we join you ? The rooms are all filled up , " I said . He lifted his eyes half open and looked at us for a moment and then said slowly , " Come right in . " Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokers always do . Our bed was opposite to his . We ordered the best opium to show we had plenty of money . The opium was soon served . Two Jap girls came in with trays , lamps , and the pipes . They put the pipes into our mouths and burned the opium until it was hot and soft , then put it on the pipes . We tried to smoke and be smart , holding their hands , talking some nonsense with them until we finished our first pipe . We let the girls go by excusing ourselves , saying we needed some rest . That was perfectly all right ; smokers always sleep there for half a day or so after smoking . We watched for a chance to talk with the gunman , but he kept on smoking and hardly opened his eyes , so we had to wait . I do not know how long it was after that smoking that I felt awfully bad and gave myself a rest . When I woke up , the gunman was ready to go . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip away , so I spoke to him . " Brother , why do n't you join us and have another pipe ? It is still early . " " Good . " A one-word answer . I figured out that his pocket might be empty , otherwise he would not leave the shop so early and join us so easily on my invitation . I handed him my pipe and opium and asked another question . " May I know your name ? Mine is Loo . " " Kwun is my name . " He Started to burn the opium . " Having a good business ? " " Not very good . " He closed his eyes , as he was falling into a beautiful opium dream . " This is really a bad year for our business men , is n't it ? " Chang asked . " Yes , I am deeply in debt and do n't even have enough money for smoking . " He said this without opening his eyes . I caught his words quickly , then I said , " Want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Five hundred dollars for just one gunman . We shall give you arms . " I lowered my voice . " Whom do you want ? " He blew out some smoke . " The head officer . " " I wo n't do it for only five hundred , and I ca n't do it alone . " " Well , how much do you want ? You can find someone to help you , " said Chang . The gunman kept on smoking for two minutes , then lifted his eyes again . " Three thousand at least , cash . " " Listen here , " I said , " we have all the information for you . You have only to do the shooting . I guarantee there is no danger . " " Three thousand . " He remained unmoved . " Well , we 'll give you one thousand if you really do the job , " Chang said . " All right , smart boys , I 'll do it for two thousand , because I need my brother 's help and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to use your own revolvers . We 'll supply them for you . You just have to pull the trigger . It is really an easy job . If you do n't take it we 'll find somebody else who will . " " Two thousand , and that 's my final word . " " Here , give you fifteen hundred , " I said , and I took out my purse and held fifty dollars in bank notes in my hand . " If you accept , you can have fifty right away . " The money had its effect and he changed his tone . " You win , brother . When are we going to do it ? " " As soon as possible . I think there is no reason for you to use more than three days , " Chang said . " That 's all right . Where and when can I get my revolvers ? " " To-morrow , here . " Then I handed over my fifty dollars to him , and reminded him to keep it secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a short time afterward we noticed to our surprise that the sky was not so dark , the stars had gone down . It was almost sun-rising time . We walked back as if drunk . The opium had us . III rrHERE is one thing you should know : you can always trust those gangsters . Once they promise you they never let you down . You do not have to worry that they might get your money and do nothing or run away . The next evening Chang and I went down to the same opium shop again . We tied one six-shooter and one automatic on our legs . It is a very popular way to carry guns for passing censorship . By midnight we arrived there and found Kwun was already there , enjoying his smoking . We had had some experience with smoking the night before and were not afraid of it any more , but I do not mean we liked it . Kwun hardly lifted his eyes and nodded to us . To our surprise we did not see his brother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the morning . " Then there was a long pause . We were all busy with our smoking . Kwun waited until the girls were through their work , then he waved his hand and let them out . " Do you have them with you ? " This time Kwun opened his mouth to ask us . The word " them " meant those revolvers of course . " We have two different kinds here ; we do n't know which kind you prefer . " We then untied the revolvers and handed them to him . He examined both the bullets and guns , then turned to us , " This six-shooter suits me . " " Good , then the other one is for your brother . They are both nice revolvers . Would you like to hear our plan ? " . " Go on . " " By eight-thirty to-morrow morning we 'll be at the corner of 37th Road and Wcn Hen Street . The officer 's car will turn there . Chang and I will wait for him on the opposite corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave our hands and by that time you must be ready . Generally when a car turns it slows down . I think that is the best time for you . " I took a photograph out of my pocket and handed it to Kwun . " This is the man . Look carefully . Be sure not to make any mistakes . Now , remember his car is black , the number is 38377 . " " You said he only has one guard . " " Right . " He did not show any excitement . Then again we fell to smoking . Five o'clock struck . The door of our private smoking room opened . A big strong figure appeared , wearing a hat so low that it almost covered half of his face . Kwun did not get up . " My brother , " he murmured . " Is everything ready ? " Kwun 's brother asked . He did not pay much attention to Chang and me , but only glanced at us . " Yes , " I said . " Only waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled at us . " Can you buy something to eat ? " " A very good idea . We ca n't go out with empty stomachs , " Kwun agreed . " Oh , waiter , " Chang shouted , ringing the bell . A waiter then came in and waited for our orders . " What would you boys prefer ? " I asked . " Oh , anything will do , better with some rice wine , " said Kwun 's brother . " Bring us your best food and some wine , " Chang ordered the waiter , who then bowed to us and went out . Ten minutes later he brought us eight dishes , two orders of soup , some rice , and two bottles of wine . The dishes were really good and we were hungry . The waiter set up the table , poured out the wine for us , then retired . I held up my glass after we sat down . " To your health , gentlemen . " " Same to you . " " Wish you luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine to the bottom and showed me their glasses . " Here is for your success . " Chang held up his . It is an old Chinese custom to drink three glasses of wine and say some lucky words to the soldiers who are going to war , and we adopted it for this occasion . We ate and talked until it was six . We had a little rest , then Kwun and his brother loaded the revolvers . By seven-thirty we were all set . Before we started off I told Kwun that I should hand him the money at the same place three days later . I paid the bill and we walked off . It was a beautiful morning , sun rising , birds singing , everything expressing the beauty of an old peaceful city . But we had no heart to appreciate this . There was already a murderous picture in my mind . Iv W ARRIVED at 37th Road by guarer-past eight . We still had forty-five minutes to wait . Chang and I walked up and down the opposite corner with beating hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps in front of a door . They seemed quite comfortable , smoking , talking , and laughing as if they did not know they were going to kill a man . Time passed slowly ; each time I looked at my watch the two hands seemed to have remained the same . More cars began to come along the street . Government cars ran by now and then , but the black car we waited for did not show up . Once more I looked at my watch . It was five past nine . If the traitor wanted to go to his office this was the time . Suddenly I saw a car moving toward us . It was black , its number was 38377 ? the right number . I waved my hand . Chang did the same . The car was now very close to us . I could see the traitor inside with one of his Japanese advisers . The car slowed down for the sharp turn ; it almost stopped . I saw Kwun and his brother jump up on their feet . Within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the front scat . His brother opened the other . Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! I could see the sparkling light of the revolvers . The traitor , the adviser , the guard leaned forward at almost the same time . Kwun and his brother started to run . They soon disappeared in a small lane . Policemen and Japanese M.P . troops soon gathered round the car . Chang and I began to walk off . There was no need for us to stay there . We hurried back to tell the news to our comrades . We told them no doubt Wong , the traitor , was dead ; we had seen him fall . But had we failed this time ? Reading the newspaper extra , we found that Wong had only hurt his arm slightly ; his Jap adviser had leaned in front of him to cover him . At first we did not believe it , but after several days Wong appeared at his adviser 's funeral , where he wept for his dear friend who had saved his life for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down to that opium shop again , carrying five hundred dollars . This payment almost put all of us into bankruptcy . Each member had contributed his share ; but since the cost was a thousand dollars more than we had planned , we were not able to pay it off all at once . I was worried about it . for the Kwun brothers had done their job , and if they had not succeeded it was not their fault . I felt I should be able to pay them as I had promised . I met Kwun there alone . He accepted the five hundred dollars and was willing to wait a week for the second five hundred and , a month for the third . But the money business kept us in a very bad position until we had paid them off a month later . V W E RECEIVED many letters from Ting and other members in Tientsin after that shooting . They expected us to send a member to Tientsin to tell them the whole story . The choice fell on me , and I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later I was in session with Ting and Lee and Shill and Hsia in Tientsin , and Ting was explaining the next job we were to do . " Now you would probably like to know all about this , " Ting said to me . " We have decided to shoot Dao Shan , the head of the police in Tientsin . He is a Chinese horn in Japan and married to a Jap girl , whose brother is now the commander-inchief of the Japanese army in North China . He likes nothing but money . He grabs money from the office and the people , especially the poor . Anybody who has not given enough money to satisfy him is turned in by Dao as a communist , and nine times out of ten is sentenced to death unless he then turns in an amount double what Dao first wanted . That is why we want to shoot him . It is not only that he is a traitor but also he disturbs the people too much . He would spend thousands of dollars on a dancing girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost all of his fortune trying to satisfy him . We want his life . He has no reason to live on . " " Have you got enough information about him ? " I asked . " Yes , " replied IIsia . " He has one bodyguard , who is one of his cousins . He dines at West Lake Hotel almost every night , then he dances there until after midnight . His wife is always with him . His car is a 1937-model Buick , black . The number is very easy to remember . It is G.00191 . " " As we have learned a lesson from our comrades in Peiping we are forced to act by ourselves , " Ting said . " It is too expensive to hire gangsters to do the job . We ca n't afford it . " Then everybody turned to me as Ting went on , " We are glad that comrade Loo is here . We both have been in the army and this will be a chance for us . " He looked at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gladly . " " That will be fine , " Lee cut in . " I hope you two can finish him . " " Is there any time limit about this ? " / asked . " We do n't give you a definite date , for in that case you may not have your work perfectly done , but we do expect you to do it as soon as you can , " Lec answered me , and that seemed to be their agreement . " All right , " said Ting , " we 'll go out tonight and look around the surroundings of West Lake Hotel ; then if we have time we 'll wait at the front door of the hotel to see if Dao comes . We do n't want to shoot until we make sure about the information we have . But before we go out we 'll study our maps and find the best way to run away . " After the meeting Ting and I studied some maps , had our supper , and went out to West Lake Hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road , and was magnificently built . There was a policeman standing at the door , but he had no pistol . His job was to open the car doors for ladies and gentlemen and to drive away beggars . So we did not have to worry about him . There were two more policemen at the two intersections of other roads , who had revolvers . According to the maps drawn by our members , there was a small path which led to the back of the hotel from a coal-ball factory , with a fork which led to Race Horse Road . Therefore , if we only could find that small path , we should be able to run away very easily , because the coal-ball factory was on the street back of the hotel , Hankow Road . If something happened on Race Horse Road the police down Hankow Road would know nothing about it . We walked up and down Race Horse Road several times , and could not find the path . Ting suggested we could go to the entrance of the factory first ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following it from the factory . We turned down Hankow Road and entered the factory . " What do you want ? " A big fellow blocked our way . " Beg pardon , is this the way to West Lake Hotel ? " We pretended that we had missed our way . " Yes , but to the back door ; the way to the front door from here is closed . " " We want to see some fellows working there . It 's better for us to use the back door . " " If you follow this path and turn to your left at the first intersection , you will find the hotel . " " Thank you very much . " " It was nothing . " We followed the path but we did not turn to our left at the intersection . We wanted to know the way to Race Horse Road . The path was very narrow . Only one person could walk along it at a time . Soon we reached the end . It was blocked by a piece of thin wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but finally I thought it must be an advertisement board , because I remembered we had walked by it several times on the other side without thinking that it might cover the entrance to the path . The board was thin and we could bend it down easily . So after a few minutes we decided to have another member stay back of the advertisement board . When he heard the shooting in front of the hotel he would bend the board down and let us pass through , and then put the board back before the police discovered it . We were quite satisfied with this small path . One more time we walked down Race Horse Road . As we approached the hotel we saw the traitor 's car there . It was new and beautiful , but it had been bought with the blood and sweat of our poor people , so that it was not truly beautiful but evil . About one o'clock in the morning the traitor came out with his wife . Both were very well dressed . His guard opened the door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exactly like the pictures of him that Hsia had collected ? short , dark , bald-headed , with a spot of a mustache . I should say he was a perfect Japanese type . Ting and I slept that night with lighter hearts . All we had to do now was to find another member to bend down the advertisement board . The next morning Ting set out to find another member . I was at home alone , amusing myself reading some stories . Ting came back with a young fellow about sixteen . His name was Ni . He was very steady and seemed quite suitable for the job , and also he was small and young , so he would not attract much attention . Ting instructed him over and over about his job , reminding him not to reveal it to others and not to run away from the path when he heard the shooting . Also we decided that we would do the shooting when Dao came out , late at night , when there would be few people walking on the sidewalk and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . We loaded our revolvers , each carried six more shots , and waited impatiently until the clock struck twelve . Then we set out . VI w iTH our hearts beating faster than a motor , we walked round the hotel . The car was there . Would to-night be Dao 's last one ? We waited . The time seemed to pass extremely slowly , and we thought everyone glanced at us with a suspicious eye . We could not keep the color of our faces from changing as time went on . If we kept on waiting we should faint before long . So Ting and I agreed to abandon our plan for that night . It was too dangerous for us to stand there with pale faces . We were not gangsters . We could not stand there looking like ordinary men . So we did not complete our task that night . We decided to find two more members and let them stay beside the hotel , unarmed , while Ting and I waited in a tearoom a block away , leaving our bicycles outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to tell the driver to start the motor , that would mean Dao would be out soon ; one of them would run down the street to tell us , and Ting and I could be there in a few seconds . That was a very good plan . We hoped it would work out all right . Five of us set out a little earlier than midnight for our next try . Ting and I with our bicycles were one block down from the hotel , and Ni again was in that small path so as to be ready to turn down the advertisement board . Ting and I waited and waited in the tearoom , drinking tea , reading newspapers , talking , waiting for our messengers . We did not remember what we were talking or reading about ; our minds were practically numb . Then after a long , long time , we saw one of the two boys who were waiting at the hotel come in andwave his hand to us . We knew it was time . We rushed out and mounted our bicycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arm . I was quite surprised and thought it was the police . But I was wrong . It was the waiter of the tearoom with the bill in his hzend . We had forgotten to pay for our tea ! There was no time for us to waste . Ting threw him a dollar and let him have the change . We were in a hurry . When we saw the car it was still about a hundred and fifty yards away , and the driver had already started the motor . We rushed over as fast as we could , but it was too late . The car was in motion , and there was no hope of catching up with it . We missed it by only a few yards . We were disappointed , but we had learned another lesson . We must pay our bill beforehand ; then when we wanted to go there would be no delay . The next night we went down again . It was raining bad weather for others , but good for us . For on a rainy night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were right but also wrong . Ting and I were drinking tea in the same tearoom again . The waiter , who got about two-thirds of the dollar Ting gave him as tip , served us very willingly . We paid our bill first this time and gave the waiter an extra tip . Time passed second by second until we saw our member come in and wave his hand . Time then passed too fast . We rushed down the street . I was a little ahead of Ting and arrived at the hotel first . Dao , the traitor , had already stepped into his car . His driver was ready to start the motor . I thought it was time , I held out my revolver . The rain poured down ; one could hardly see five feet . Suddenly I remembered Ting ? where was he ? I looked back and saw him lying on the sidewalk with his bike several feet away . What had happened ? I put my revolver in my pocket again . ( Luckily the rain had prevented Dao and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand just a few feet from their car . ) I went to Ting quickly . He had lost consciousness , The road was very slippery and when he had tried to get off his bike he had fallen , hurting his head on the sidewalk . We failed that night again . We had no time to shoot . We helped Ting back and postponed our plan for another night . Dao did not show up on either of the next two nights . It was on the seventh night that Dao went down to that hotel again and we went to the tea shop . The sudden appearance of Dao made Ting and me feel a little uneasy . We drank tea like water , cup after cup , and soon we felt full and could not drink any more . So we began to read the newspaper . After finishing a story we could not remember what it was about . Our pulses jumped faster and faster . could not stand it any longer . I called the waiter to bring us a pack of weeds . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made us feel a little nervous . Suddenly Ting hit me on my back . One of the members who had been waiting in front of the hotel had just come in . We rushed off . When we saw Dao 's car , Dao and his wife were already inside it . His guard sat in the front . What were they waiting for ? Why did not they start the ear ? Ah , his driver was not in , but where was he ? We had no way of knowing . I jumped off my bike . My heart stopped beating so fast . I forgot everything else and suddenly realized that I was not afraid . Ting opened the front door of the car and fired . I opened the other door . When the traitor saw me with a revolver and saw that Ting had fired at his guard , his mouth opened wide but no words or sound came out . Dao 's wife had already fainted . I pulled my trigger , once , twice ? until all the six shots were gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bikes quickly and began to pedal fast . We ran into each other and fell off . Then we got on our bikes again . We turned into the small pathbut did not see Ni there . ( Of course he had not run away , otherwise we should not have been able to get through . It was just the fault of our eyes that we could not notice anything . ) We hurried past the coal-ball factory , turned off two blocks down Hankow Road , and went directly home . Then we sat down our hearts almost leaped from our throats . We began to feel scared . Our faces turned pale . Our ears hurt from the noise of the explosion of the revolvers . They kept on singing like a bee all the time . We felt exhausted , as if we had no energy at all . We threw ourselves on the bed , lying there and saying nothing . About half an hour later we heard a knock on the door . Ting and I jumped up from the bed , holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afraid someone had followed us . I forgot my revolver was already empty . What could be the use of holding an unloaded revolver ? Then there was another knock on the door . " Who is it ? " Ting asked . " This is Ni . Are you all right ? " Both of us sighed , feeling as if we could see the sun again . I stepped forward to open the door . Ting still held his revolver in his hand . It was Ni . He gave us a smile . " What 's wrong , boys , do n't you recognize me ? " " Surely ! Come in . We were just scared by your knocking . It might have been somebody else . " Ni came in and closed the door , then he held out his hand , " Congratulations , boys , it 's done . " Both of us sighed again . We had done something at last . It was worth our time and our fears .
