txt The Japanese have made another landing in New Guinea . This one is at Milne Bay , on the southeastern tip of the island , and United Nations ground forces already are in contact with the enemy there . The landing was not a surprise to our ground forces . These facts were revealed today in a communiqu ? from General Douglas 's headquarters and by a headquarters spokesman . There is no word as to whether the ground action has assumed any significant proportions , but there is no doubt about the importance of the Milne Bay position to the United Nations forces . The bay is 225 miles southeast of Port Moresby , New Guinea , and about 400 miles from the big Japanese base at Rabaul , New Britain . A successful incursion by the Japanese would mean that they- would have a strategically located airfield from which to break up United Nations air raids on Rabaul , Also , they would have another strong point from which to attack the United Nations base at Port Moresby . The Japanese landed from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air force from low altitudes in extremely bad weather . Flying Fortresses sank one enemy transport , heavily damaged and probably sank one cruiser and damaged one destroyer . B-26 medium bombers and P-40 fighters heavily bombed , and strafed Japanese barges , supplies and troops who had got ashore . Many fires were started , the communiqu ? said , and six landing barges were destroyed . Move Was Anticipated This convoy was the one that had been attacked Tuesday night ' near the Trobriand Islands , about 100 miles north of Milne Bay . On that occasion our planes sank a Japanese gunboat and strafed two transports . This correspondent would like to emphasize the official statement that " our ground forces anticipated this movement and are in contact . " This statement should be compared with the situation when the Japanese made a surprise landing in the BunaGona area of New Guinea a month ago . The communiqu ? that told of the Milne Bay developments also reported a successful air attack on Buna , where the Japanese have established an air strip . Despite bad weather our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANDING IS COSTLY IN EAST NEW GUINEA // fighters that were caught while they were taking off . This was the second attack on the Buna field in two days , in which time nineteen Zeros were destroyed , with the loss of but one of our fighters . In this connection it is recalled that when the Japanese first took Buna , United Nations Headquarters issued a statement saying that it would be difficult for either side to operate an air base there because of its close proximity to enemy bases . As it is now , we hold the top of the Owen Stanley range , separating Buna and our airdromes1 in the Port Moresby area . Thus it is impossible for the Japanese to get warnings of impending raids until our planes appear on the northern side of the mountains , and from the top of the range to the Buna field it is , as one officer put it , " only a whoop and a holler . " Weather Helped Enemy is a fair guess that the concentrations of Zeros at Buna were meant to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese had more important help than air support . For several days the weather in that area has been the worst possible for it operations , with the ceiling ranging from 300 to 500 feet . Under such circumstances it is hard to find , let alone hit , a moving convoy . It is possible that the convoy had been waiting for just such weather conditions before attempting the landing . The bay on which the landing was effected is about twenty miles deep and is within twenty miles of what used to be the important island community of Samarai . The upper arm of land on the bayl ; shore is a long peninsula , along which the Owen Stanley Mountains form a high ridge . The territory south of the bay also is mountainous . Aside from the area about the farthest inland section of the bay , there is little room for troop movements . In general , the bay is fringed with a narrow stretch of swampy land . Down the northern arm there is a path that is passable in the dry season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese face the most difficult terrain conditions . This new Japanese move may well be a part of the enemy 's reaction to the Solomons battle . With the loss of the southeastern Solomons , the Japanese position in the northern Solomons is seriously threatened , which means that the important harbor and air base at Rabaul is much less secure . If the enemy had Milne Bay , Rabaul would be amply guarded against attack from the southwest and the forces there could concentrate on what we sent from the Solomons . Moreover , the Japanese would be , in a good position to knock out Port Moresby and force the entire United Nations air effort back to the Australian mainland . In view of the importance of Milne Bay , it can safely be predicted that General will . do his utmost to drive out the small Japanese force that has made a landing . There can be no retreat . In the northwestern sector United Nations bombers made another attack yesterday on the Japanese air base at Deli , on Timor Island , where fires were started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Broome , in Northwestern Australia , but no casualties or damage were reported . This raid may have been a reply to the series of raids we have been making on Timor .
