About a month ago , Sumner Welles wrote a few South American friends that he had resigned as Under Secretary of State , took a train for swank Bar Harbor . But Welles 's resignation has not yet been announced : no successor has been named . <P> Replacing Welles is as difficult an appointment as Franklin Roosevelt has ever had to make . To be successful , the new Under Secretary should be : <P> 1 ) A skillful administrator . Power-jealous Cordell Hull has been bringing more &; more under State Department control the many agencies that deal with foreign countries . Last week even Foreign Food Administrator Herbert Lehman , who has been mumbling resignation , gave in . <P> 2 ) A master of bureaucratic politics . When able Norman Armour , Ambassador to Argentina , was mentioned for Under Secretary , State Department officials shook their heads , said he would never make the grade . The reason : Armour is ' ' too friendly with everyone . " <P> 3 ) An able policy maker . Presumably Cordell Hull never again wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department is under heavy fire from U.S. citizens who believe that the management of U.S. affairs is bumbling , foolishly snooty toward liberal elements , unnecessarily solicitous of Fascists , insufficiently cooperative with the Russians and the Chinese . The sacking of Welles made him the darling of Hull 's " liberal " enemies-a good deal more of a darling than perhaps he ought to be on his past record . To replace Welles with an Under Secretary whose main virtue is that he is a Hull man would almost certainly release another critical barrage , and again seriously diminish U.S. confidence in the State Department . <P> Most frequently mentioned for the job thus far have been Breckinridge Long and Dean Acheson. now Assistant Secretaries of State ; Ambassador to Mexico George S. Messersmith ; James C. Dunn , political relations adviser to Hull ; and Wayne Coy , Assistant Director of the Budget . None of these would solve Franklin Roosevelt 's dilemma . Under the present organization of the Department , no one could be a really successful Under Secretary .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
