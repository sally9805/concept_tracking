txt Diversion of Tax Funds Regretted Apropos the news item in your paper of Feb. 1 that Supreme Court Justice Louis A. Valenti dismissed a taxpayer 's suit attempting to restrain the city from using the proceeds of the special occupancy tax for general city purposes , may I say that friends of public housing will be keenly disappointed with the ruling . I sponsored the enabling act in the 1938 session of the Legislature , and the late Councilman B. C. Vladeck had a similar measure repassed as a city ordinance in 1939 . I am certain that it was neither his intention nor mine that the proceeds of this special tax , which were intended solely for the purpose of subsidizing city housing projects , should be used for any other purpose . Justice Valenti 's decision appears to me a misinterpretation of the ordinance which , although not deliberate , will divert $500,000 badly needed for public housing to general city expenditures .
