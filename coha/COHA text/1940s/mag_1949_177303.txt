If teacher says flatly that fresh water always freezes at 32 F. under normal atmospheric pressure , she is wrong . Before it can turn to ice , water needs nuclei-minute particles , usually of some other substance , e.g. , dust . Last week , General Electric Research Laboratory announced that its scientists had succeeded in supercooling water to 39 below zero-71 lower than its normal freezing point . At that temperature , nuclei seemed to form spontaneously and the supercooled water finally became ice . <P> Metals act the same way . Mercury thermometers are of little use in Arctic winters because they freeze at 37.7 below zero . G.E . researchers kept mercury , free of foreign nuclei , in a liquid state down to an unearthly 109.7 below . Tin , which normally " freezes " in a hot oven at 449.4 , was kept molten down to 251 . <P> Nature long ago beat G.E . to the trick . Clouds often contain water which is below the freezing point , unfrozen because of the lack of nuclei . G.E . was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn such clouds into snow ) when it made its discovery .
