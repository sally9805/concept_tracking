Seldom in all its 57 years had Carnegie Hall been so jammed-and never so racked by such raucous music . The 200 fans on stage had the most tranquil spot : they were behind the brass . But out in front , the louder it got , the better they liked it . And no band yet had outblown Stan Kenton 's for sheer din per man . <P> It was n't swing : toothy Stan Kenton had already pronounced that " dead , gone , finished . " Some doubted that it was even jazz : it had a shifty beat ( and sometimes none ) , little-if any-form , and even less improvisation . Most of it sounded like Duke Ellington with the D.T.s . But when Kenton 's band got to pushing out such huge , screeching blotches of sound as Artistry Jumps and Message to Harlem , the fans ripped the place wide open . They listened to his newest and most pretentious masterpiece ; , Prologue Suite in Four Movements , in a state of glassy somnam-bulance . When Kenton capped it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard such yelling in years . <P> This week Kenton moved into Chicago 's Civic Opera House for a one-night stand ; the 4,200 seats and standing room had been sold out for two weeks , and 3,000 ticket-buyers had been turned away . ( It was no trouble at all to get seats in advance for the Metropolitan Opera 's famed Ezio Pinza that afternoon . ) <P> Band of the Year . Not since the first golden days of Glenn Miller and Harry James had a band 's popularity reached the proportions of a craze . What was all the shouting about ? <P> Kenton is a 6 ft. 4 in . Californian who at 36 has the same ambition Paul Whiteman had in the ' 20s : to marry classical music and jazz . In Whiteman 's case , what emerged was pseudo-symphonic-a blend of Tin Pan Alley and Tchaikovsky . In Kenton 's , it is a driving , nervous ( and technically skillful ) wedding of swing and Schonberg . Kenton started his outfit in 1941 , got ahead fast by getting up early to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit a new town . For the past two years , his musicians have been voted Band of the Year . <P> Stan Kenton considers his " progressive jazz " just what the psychiatrist ordered . Last month , he sat down with a Down Beat reporter ( Harvardman Mike Levin ) , gave him a 62-column interview that sounded sometimes like a seminar in psychology , sometimes like a talk with Father Divine . Said Kenton : " . . . The human race today may be going through . . . nervous frustration and thwarted emotional development which traditional music is entirely incapable of not only satisfying , but representing . "
