At one time , visitors who rang the bell at the door of Zppritzstrasse No. 46 in the little Bavarian town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen heard a recorded voice boom through a speaking tube : " Dr. Strauss is not at home . . . Dr. Strauss is not at home . " After awhile , when even tall ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) , ruddy-faced Dr. Strauss had tired of his crusty prank , visitors were merely asked by a servant to state their business . In most cases they were turned away . Last week , in Garmisch-Partenkirchen , a visitor called who would not be denied . Death came to Richard Strauss , 85 , one of the great composers of his age . <P> For Strauss it had been a lifetime of music . His first compositions were written when he was six ; he kept working right up to his final illness . But for music lovers , nothing he wrote after 47 came near what he had done before . He never again reached the heights of his great opera , Der Rosenkavalier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precocious , Munich-born Richard Strauss had written under the influence of Mozart and Brahms . But after about 1885 , Strauss 's contemporaries called his work " psychopathic music . " They railed against the brazen dissonances in his huge , Wagnerian tone poems ( Don Quixote , Thus Spake Zarathustra , Death and Transfiguration , etc. ) , the savage horrors of his operas Salome and Elektra , his general lack of taste in composition . But no one could overlook his genius : his unique gifts as an orchestrator , his penetrating power for illuminating character and for describing anything from the zany antics of Don Quixote to the bestiality of Salome . <P> A Touching Image . In some ways , Strauss the man mirrored the strengths and weaknesses of his music . Even to the late admiring critic , Lawrence Gilman , he was a composer who could " mold a beautiful or touching or heroic tonal image , and then distort it by scrawling a bad joke somewhere on its surface . " He was a man who composed a great symphonic poem about his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heldenleben ( A Hero 's Life ) . <P> He loved art , collected El Grecos , Tintorettos and Rubenses . A genial man , he liked to play cards ( skat ) and drink beer , but usually had to sneak away from his strong-willed wife Pauline to do it . His favorite opera , he always said , was one he finished in 1923 called Intermezzo , the story of a musician and his termagant spouse . <P> Even more , he loved to make money-and hang on to it . According to one story , he once invited Parisian celebrities to a post-premiere feast at Larue 's , ordered the finest food and wines . When the assemblage had cheered him , he had the waiter bring each guest a separate check . <P> A Final Clearance . He was a man who stubbornly insisted he could never take politics seriously ( " Ich bin Knstler " -I am an artist ) , but he let the Nazis make him head of their Reichsmusikkammer ( State Chamber of Music ) in 1933 . He resigned when the Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo von Hofmannsthal ( who had died in 1929 ) and Stefan Zweig . Last year , Strauss was finally cleared by a denazification court .
