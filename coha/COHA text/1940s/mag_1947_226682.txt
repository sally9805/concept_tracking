" The evidence presented to this committee clearly indicates that Senator Bilbo improperly used his high office as United States Senator for his personal gain in his dealings with war contractors . " <P> With this gloved haymaker , the Senate 's War Investigating Committee this week summed up its findings against Mississippi 's wily , ailing Theodore Gilmore Bilbo . <P> All in all , the Bilbo report was one of the stiffest condemnations of a Senator by his colleagues ever to be submitted to the upper house . Despite the evasions , gags and protestations of " The Man " and of pro-Bilbo witnesses during the seven-day hearing , the committee had found Bilbo guilty of accepting money or gratuities from at least half a dozen war contractors . " The donation or ... solicitation of political contributions from Government contractors , " said the committee coldly , " . . . is prohibited by a federal criminal statute . " <P> Unfortunately , the power to seat Bilbo or throw him out did not rest with the committee , but with the Senate itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club to cut off its festering member .
