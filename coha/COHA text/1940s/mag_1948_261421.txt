Billy Rose had already given five columns worth of detailed advice to the Metropolitan Opera Association on how to cure its ills ( TIME , Sept. 6 ) . Last week , he tossed off some parting general prescriptions , called them his " fond adieu to the fair land of Culture and Confusion " : <P> 1 ) " Junk the gingerbread monstrosity on 39th Street and build a modern opera house , equipped with the last word in mechanical , electrical and acoustical stage devices . . . <P> 2 ) " Tie a can to the so-called traditional methods of producing grand opera and stage it in terms of the present-day American theater ... If it seemed better show business to project The Ride of the Valkyries ' by means of a motion-picture machine than to do it with four girls on hobbyhorses , a motion-picture machine should be used . . . <P> 3 ) " Adapt and translate the librettos into the language Joe speaks-English . . . " Billy complained that when the average European goes to the opera , he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Joe Citizen in this country is shoehorned into a tuxedo , he feels that he 's going to a concert . Joe is n't interested in the plot because he does n't know what the plot is all about , and the stilted jabberwocky in the printed libretto only confuses him further . . . " <P> How much would it cost to build a modern opera house and restage the entire repertory ? Billy 's guess : $20,000,000 . His proposed test question for every Met production : " Will it interest a man in the first mezzanine who saw High Button Shoes last night and is going to see Mister Roberts tomorrow night ?
