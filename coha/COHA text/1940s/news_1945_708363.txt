txt Curb on Union Feather-Bedding ' By Musicians Is Asked of WLB Radical modification of the traditional contract policy of the American Federation of Musicians requiring employers to hire fixed numbers of its members regardless of the amount of available work , has been recommended in a formal panel report filed with the Regional War Labor Board , it was disclosed yesterday . The report , which contains a strong condemnation of union " feather-bedding " practices , and consequent waste of manpower , particularly in wartime , must , however , be upheld by the regional board and perhaps the national one , before it becomes an official WLB order . It was prepared by Dr. Herbert R. Northrup , a senior hearing officer of the regional board , who conducted a hearing in which radio station WOV , featuring Italian-American programs , sought to free itself from its present obligation to New York Local 802 of the union to employ a quota of twelve musicians . The current dispute dates back to last February , when negotiations were opened for a new contract . Dr. Northrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for a 15 per cent wage increase , based on the Little Steel formula , but said the station obviously had no need for twelve musicians , and recommend // ed a reduction of the quota to five . Sanford H. Cohen , attorney for the station , while expressing satisfaction with most of the decision 's contents , said he would have preferred the elimination of the quota requirement completely , and Dr. Northrup 's reasoning in the report indicated that he had almost come to this conclusion . Analyzing the background of the issues between WOV and Local 802 , Dr. Northrup said it was true that the musicians had had for a number of years quota agreements with radio stations , theatres , opera houses and symphony orchestras , and that for ten years Station WOV had operated under such a anota . He added , however , that the quota was accepted by WOV under protest , that as a result of the station 's resistance the quota was reduced from sixteen to twelve in 1941 , and that friction had continued , with the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr. Northrup , the quota system arose out of the union 's " wholly legitimate desire to further the employment of its members and to protect them from fluctuations in employment , " but coupled with the musicians ' recently won 2-cent tax on each record manufactured as a protection deleted 4 lines He quoted a recent decision written by Walter Gellhorn , vice chairman of the regional board , in which the statement was made that " no principle of law or economics or ethics warrants the preservation by governmental order of managerial power to deal unfairly with employes . " " Likewise it may be said , " Dr. Northrup wrote , " that no principle of law or economics or ethics war rants the preservation of unionism 's power to deal unfairly with employers by obsolete and uneconomic feather-bedding , ' pay-without-work rules . " If such is true at any time , it is true now . The War Labor Board can not act in a vacuum ; it is a creature of war and must never ignore that fact . We are today in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Feather-bedding ' without a doubt contributes to this shortage . It has no place in our war effort . " Nor can the union argue plausibly that its members are musicians , not factory workers . We have already found that unemployment among musicians is absent . If the musicians herein in volved can not , even in the present labor market , find employment in their trade , they will find ample opportunities in war work . " They can learn to perform new jobs just as 11,000,000 men and women in the armed services and many more millions in war work have done . To be sure , this is a harsh statement . But it is quite mild compared to the realities of war . " Harry Sacher , union attorney , who has seven days to file objections to the recommendation , said he was " morally certain " that it would not be upheld by the War Labor Board . " What the hearing officer proposes , " he added , " is that a decade of collective bargaining be upset by his fiat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union and station WOV has contained a clause requiring the station to employ a minimum number of musicians . " We are certain that the War Labor Board will not adopt a recommendation which exposes workers , to the loss of gains made in pre-war days because they are faithfully adhering to their nostrike pledge .
