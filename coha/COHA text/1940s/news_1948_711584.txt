txt Gov . Thomas E. Dewey told a capacity audience at Municipal Auditorium tonight that President Truman was running a tired and confused administration which was no longer strengthening the cause of America or of peace . What the country needed , the Governor said in a major address in Mr. Truman 's , home state , was a competent government , and the best way to achieve that , he implied , was with a combination of faith , hope and the Republican ticket . This speech and the social events that went ' with it were the highlights of a day in which the " Victory Special " rolled northward through the Ozarks and proceeded on tonight to Minnesota , where Mr. Dewey hopes to help re-elect Senator Joseph H. Ball . Mr. Ball , who restrained - his enthusiasm for Mr. Dewey 's candidacy in 1944 , is plumping for the Governor this time . Mr. Dewey 's thesis this evening was that the country was going through a critical period with a government which was " coming apart at the seams , " but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remedied by " good government " controlled by competent Republicans . What the " ship of state needs , " Mr. Dewey said , was " a rudder . " It could also use , he ' added , " a firm hand on the tiller , " for the nation , he concluded , was " at the crossroads " and needed " good government " if we were to " keep our appointment with our greatness . " " We know the kimi of Government we have now , " the Governor said . " It is tired . It is confused . It scolds and complains . It runs off in a dozen different directions at once . - It tries to frighten people . // It divides them . It is coming apart at the seams . Whatever may be its intentions the tragic fact is that it is not strengthening the cause of peace , and it is not strengthening America . " That was Mr. Dewey 's indictment . His remedy was to provide " good government , " and the keys to this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity and competence among those administering our affairs . Mr. Dewey had something to say about all these qualities : 1 . Unity  --  No job was too big for America , Mr. Dewey said , if the nation were united . The Republicans were looking ahead prayerfully and hopefully to a peaceful world and were determined to make that peace secure by the strength that came only from competent leadership expressing the will of a united people . 2 . Faith  --  Good government , he asserted , required faith . Its whole structure must rest on the belief that government was the servant and not the master of the people . That , said Mr. Dewey , took faith ? faith in our people , faith in America . Such faith , he added , was justified , for under the Republicans the future was " bright with promise . " Government Unity Pledged 3 . Purpose  --  To get good government , he continued , we must have an administration which knew not only what it was doing , but where . it was going . One body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time without splitting apart . " I pledge to you , " he declared , " that beginning next January 20 , we will have a national administration that knows where it is going and goes there all together and in one piece . " 4 . Integrity  --  A government without integrity , the Governor told his audience , was a demoralized government that could not at . tract capable , unselfish people to the public service . " Your next administration , " he pledged , " is going to bring to government men and women who are honest with themselves , and honest with each other . They will be truthful with the people and truthful in their dealings with Congress . We are going to restore integrity to the Government of the United States of America " 5 . Competence  --  This meant , he said , the " know-how " and the ability to do the job . The United States would have competent administration when the Government was manned by people who had ability , judgment and experience ? who were energetic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey did not attempt to reply to President Truman 's recent remark that unity , efficiency and competence were not necessarily good qualities unless- they were al .. lied to good policies . Mr. Dewey stuck to general themes , apparently on the theory that all he had to do to win was avoid any great blunder . The Governor told . Ms audience a story about a Truman Adminis.1 tration official in the Surplus Property Division who testified that he had a " petty cash " fund of " between eight and twelye million dollars " for which he could not account . Mr. Dewey said he thought that sort of thing ought- to be stopped , and the crowd seemed , on the whole , to agree with him . Kansas City gave Mr. Dewey by far the most enthusiastic reception he has had on this particular trip . Nearly 14,000 Republicans from this city and neighboring Missouri arid Kansas communities jammed the Municipal Auditorium , and while Mr. Dewey 's speech seemed to many persons to define objectives on which there was absolutely no disagreement , the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has/had such a remarkable career in the past decade . In the small towns where the train stopped , Mr. Dewey went out of his way to seek the election of all Republicans . This has been true of everybody from John Sherman Cooper , the liberal Republican Senator from Kentucky , to C. Wayland Brooks , the conservative from Chicago . The general impression on the train , however , is that while the Governor is continuing to protect a long lead in the Presidential campaign by cautious , general speeches , he has not had much influence on any of the Congressional contests in the four states visited on the trip so far .
