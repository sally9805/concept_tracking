Photogenic Faye Emerson Roosevelt and her husband ( the late President 's scatter-quote son ) last week paid Joseph Stalin a birthday ( his 67th ) visit in the Kremlin . Faye and Elliott reported that their host , who had been ailing at Sochi in the Caucasus , looked very well , as indeed he did in a highly retouched photograph ( see cut ) issued by Sovfoto , the official Soviet photo service . If Stalin imparted any immortal confidences and earth-shaking forecasts , Elliott has n't revealed them-yet . <P> But if the New York newspapers with astrology columns reach Stalin he can read horoscopes which make as much sense as many columns of weighty political analysis . On Dec. 21 the Journal-American 's Frances Drake advised : " You are sometimes too obstinate for the success that can be yours . . . . Correct the tendency to value material gain too highly . " The Daily News 's Marion Drew was still more specific : <P> " You have two more years ahead in which it will be hard for you to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests loom up . Most of these will be sudden and out of your usual run , but need not be difficult or unpleasant , since you are usually an adaptable person . Your health may cause a little alarm , but this will be largely nervous in origin , not constitutional defect , so do not worry . "
