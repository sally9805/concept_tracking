An Englishman these days must feel , in the words of Job , " full of trouble . " Each week brings its strains and shocks and this one will forever be outstanding in British history , for it has brought the final decisions to quit India and to pass the burden of Palestine to other hands . But the decisions are not entirely negative ; they do n't mean surrender ; they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those responsibilities that can be borne are going to be shirked . There was also the White Paper on defense last week to give proof of that . Great Britain is retreating , but she has retreated before and still won the last battle . Those who are today chronicling her misfortunes would be rash prophets to say that Britain is defeated when the British themselves do n't know it and do n't think so . Some Harsh Realities One can work up to this week 's announced abandonment of India and Palestine from some rather harsh realities . World War II was fought with Britain as an equal partner among three . To be sure , the United States and the Soviet Union were throwing greater weight at the end , but Britain held the lines alone at the beginning and history can well be expected to apportion credit for the victory fairly evenly . But then peace came , only to demonstrate that Britain was a mere shell of her former greatness . She had begun the war a very great and very rich imperial power ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must that Britain still possesses faith and courBRITAIIV 'S BEVIN The Daily News Chronicle ( London ) age , it still remains a fact that these are not commodities calculated to take the place of British naval supremacy , British financial domination , British investments abroad , British trade and everything else that went to make up British material Dower . These having gone , the grip upon India was bound to weaken and so was authority in Palestine , Egypt and the Far East . There is no need to seek profound or subtle reasons for this . Britain is weak . A weak nation can not maintain a great empire . Therefore the British are being forced to liquidate much of their empire , at least in its . present form . At the same time there is another aspect of these same problems that explains why they have taken their present form . They were soluble only by taking sides . Had Britain been willing to throw her weight behind either the Hindus or the Moslems in India , and either the Jews or Arabs in Palestine there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the British could never see either the justice or the practical value of that sort of solution . They have preferred instead first to try and find compromises or answers acceptable to the conflicting communities and , failing that , to place the responsibility where they think it belongs ? in India on the Indians and in Palestine on the United Nations . most of the British Government leaders felt was necessary to take . S.o long as the British remained in India , each community played for exclusive British support and neither faced up to the primary responsibility of getting together and building a strong political foundation for the future . With Palestine there was that same irreconcilability , this time between Arab and Jew , but the juridical and international position was such that the British could not toss Palestine overboard and say good riddance . The primary factors there were , first , inability to satisfy both Jews and Arabs ; secondly , strong American pressure and advice on behalf of the Jews ; and , finally , the problem of Empire defense which makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out somebody else has to do the defending  --  and who knows whether that somebody else might not even do more and fill the vacuum ? When the Marquess of Linlithgow was Viceroy under Winston Churchill 's government during the war he always worried about that vacuum and , like so many others , feared that the Soviet Union would fill it .. A Task for Indians Now it will be for the Indians to guard their own frontiers . They could not have done so during World War II when the Japanese drove right through Burma but the Indians can fight and can show discipline as well as courage , so it is hoped that before many years pass India will be strong enough to defend the independence that is going to be her 's by next year . Palestine is another problem of a similar sort and in this case it is for the United States to . do some worrying . So long as large British garrisons defended the Middle East , as they did in two world wars , there was not too much to be anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans have vast and vital oil resources in the Middle East . What is happening , in short , is a shift in the balance of power throughout the Middle East with a partial vacuum being created . The United Nations is not ready yet to fill it . The British are now concentrating on defending these parts of their empire that remain . It may seem a little strange at the end of a recital of the liquidation of the British Empire to talk of imperial defense , but it is well to do so because it provides the necessary corrective to excessive pessimism and denigration , As the White Paper on defense showed , Britain right now has more than a million men and women under arms with a labor force of 450,000 producing and servicing for them . This country is yielding what ground it must in foreign fields , but it has no intention of tossing away the fruits of seven years of intense war effort crowned by victory . Communications in the Mediterranean and Middle East will be safeguarded ; the British Navy , Army and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean , Malaya and Hongkong and the British Army will play its part in the occupation of Japan , Germany and Austria as long as is necessary . Security Council Backing The voice of Britain in the United Nations will be backed by whatever armed forces the Security Council requires . Above all , the links that bind the Commonwealth will be maintained . Looked at from the positive angle , rather than the negative , no one can deny the greatness of the British Empire even in its present weakened state , even without India and without the domination of Palestine and Egypt , even with its trade and economy crippled as they are today . " She has seen dark days before , " Ralph Waldo Emerson said exactly 100 years ago . " In the storm of battle and calamity , she has a secret vigor and a pulse like a cannon . " Liquidation Problems But one of the hard lessons that the British have learned in the last two years is that it is in some ways easier to acquire an Empire than to liquidate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestine remain , and it is conceivable that , as with Canada , Australia and New Zealand , they may yet prove stronger between free and sovereign states than between the imperial power and her dependencies . The background of this week 's developments provides the reasons for such hopes . India has been ruled by Britain for nearly two centuries . Her unity , culture , politioak ideas and economic structure are deeply impregnated with British elements . In the immediate future her finances , trade , security and place in international affairs partly depend on British guidance and support . These are the factors that explain how and why the Labor Government had dared this week to- announce that India is being left to the Indians . It is a tremendous gamble but one that
