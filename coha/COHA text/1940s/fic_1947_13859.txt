An old two-story white frame house is up for auction on a hot evening in the summer of 1945 in the city of Angels Aghast , California . The front of the house has been covered with circus and side-show posters , patent medicine advertisements , pictures of candidates for public office , lovers ' initials , and hand-painted mottoes of religious or amorous import . " The wages of sin is death , sayeth the Lord . " " Is not , Sayeth Harry . Sinned here , feel fine . " THREE YOUNG MEN stand nearby , watching : a SOLDIER , a SAILOR and a MARINE , in uniform . They might be angels , and they are certainly frequently aghast , as they witness all of the scenes of the play , standing to one side or moving in close to the action . They respond to what happens , approving or disapproving . They are now stiff and straight , and they carry miscellaneous weapons . Loud radio jazz of the summer of 1945 is heard , followed by applause so sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this national radio madness is evident on the BOY of thirteen who wears a red-white-and-blue striped jersey , white tennis trousers and white shoes , as he rehearses boogie dancing with his GIRL in the street . She wears the same model of jersey , white shorts , and red sandals which are laced high above the ankle . The fat AUCTIONEER , sitting on the steps , watches them with disgust , while the tall ADMINISTRATOR of the estate walks about on the porch , hawking and spitting as he goes . AUCTIONEER Get away from here ! Scat ! Scat ! ( The DANCERS hug and kiss as they dance ) Scat , I say ! You 're in public ! Boogie boogie boogie . The street is no place for the handsome likes of you . Get away ! Get away from here ! I 've got a rotten house to sell at auction . p. 3 THE BOY Ah , shaddap , fat man ! AUCTIONEER Scat , I say ! Off with you ! Boogie boogie boogie ! Off to the movies now ! Kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaddap ! ADMINISTRATOR ( Hawk-spit ) If you 've come to see the auction , please behave like ladies and gentlemen . THE BOY Shaddap ! The only way to get rid of that house is to burn it down . ( He strikes a match ; holds out the flame ) I 'll start the fire for you . ADMINISTRATOR ( Hawk-swallow ) Put out that match ! THE BOY Shaddap ! ADMINISTRATOR As the administrator of the estate , I 'll put you in the hands of the police . THE BOY Shaddap , shaddap ! He lights cigarette , inhales deeply , places the cigarette in the lips of the GIRL , blows out the flame , flicks the match-stick at the ADMINISTRATOR , and goes off with the girl . The TWO MEN fall silent as the nearby radio fills the evening with more madness . The AUCTIONEER stands and stretches . AUCTIONEER I 'm hungry . ADMINISTRATOR ( Hawk-spit ) They say the American people eat too much . p. 4 AUCTIONEER I do n't care what they say . I 'm disgusted and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit down and eat . I do n't eat with the rest of the family , you know . Ca n't stand the noise . I make them turn off the radio , too . The damn boogie boogie boogie makes me sick to my stomach . ADMINISTRATOR Is that so ? AUCTIONEER Yes , and how much longer do you want me to hang around this time ? ADMINISTRATOR Oh , we 'll have the house sold in no time at all . AUCTIONEER You 've said that every year since 1939 . Nobody ever comes to the auctions , and you know it . ADMINISTRATOR Do n't worry , we 'll have a nice crowd this year . ( Hawk-spit ) Houses are n't easy to find these days , you know . AUCTIONEER This one is . ADMINISTRATOR Yes , it is a landmark in Angels Aghast , famous from one end of town to the other . AUCTIONEER Famous as a haunted house . ADMINISTRATOR Only children believe the house is haunted . The house is famous as the mansion of Sam Ego . AUCTIONEER Proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long has poor Sam been in the lunatic asylum ? p. 5 ADMINISTRATOR Twenty-five years . I 've been the administrator of the estate twenty-five years . AUCTIONEER That long ? It must be a nice place . ADMINISTRATOR Last year they planted one of the biggest institutional Victory Gardens in the country . You may have eaten some of the potatoes they sold in the open market . AUCTIONEER You mean the lunatics planted the Garden ? ADMINISTRATOR Oh , yes . Not only that , the excitement of War restored the mind of a Brigadier General , whereupon he was put in charge of three divisions in Southern Italy . AUCTIONEER What about Sam Ego ? ADMINISTRATOR He 's still the same . Still shaking with uncontrollable laughter . AUCTIONEER The War did n't cure him ? ADMINISTRATOR No , just the Brigadier General . AUCTIONEER I do n't want to hear any more about it.They fall silent again while the nearby radio goes on with its monkey business . The AUCTIONEER suddenly leaps to his feet in a frenzy . AUCTIONEER I see a man coming ! For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll open the auction . ( The ADMINISTRATOR hawks and spits as he stumbles down the rickety steps of the porch to the street ) Ladies and gentlemen ! I am going to sell this handsome house at public auction to the highest bidder . Built at the turn of the century by Sam Ego , the house was designed for noble and gracious living . Although unoccupied for some time , the mansion requires only a few minor repairs to be as good as new.A lean , hard , hungry-looking man appears . p. 6 ADMINISTRATOR This is the house-mover , I 'm afraid . AUCTIONEER Oh . ( He sits down wearily . ) HOUSE-MOVER I came to study the problem . ( He looks under the house ) The rollers have sunk into the earth , I see , but if they have n't rotted my brother and I can get them out all right . He 'll be along in a few minutes . We have n't moved a house in six years , and we 've never moved a house this big . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty dollars is n't going to be enough . Have you sold the house ? ADMINISTRATOR The auctioneer will sell the house in just a moment . In the meantime , as the administrator of the estate , let me repeat that two hundred and fifty dollars is all the money I can permit to be spent on moving it . There is an out-of-town house-moving concern which is eager to accept the job , but of course I would rather keep the business here at home . HOUSE-MOVER Well , if we did n't have to move the house too far my brother and I might be able to do it for two hundred and fifty dollars . ADMINISTRATOR You would be legally responsible for getting the house to its new location in a reasonable amount of time , you know . HOUSE-MOVER Oh , we 'd get it there in a reasonable amount of time all right . It 's been sitting here forty-five years , six years on our brand-new rollers which cost good hard money when you offered us the job in 1939 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 ADMINISTRATOR A day and a half , perhaps ? HOUSE-MOVER No , a good deal longer than that . It 's to be rolled , you know , but it will not go as an automobile does . Very slowly  --  very slowly indeed , with my brother or myself under the house taking chances on getting squashed . I remember the foundations as having been well along in rot . Now , if they were to smash , moving the house would be more like dragging , which of course takes more time than rolling , and of course it 's a good deal more dangerous , too . We 've made a study of these things and understand the principles of physics involved . We know any amount of time we may take will be relatively reasonable . Mind you , I said relatively . Pay us enough to hire the horses , and then you may go home to bed , and the day after tomorrow see the house on its way down the street . That 's the long and short of it , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADMINISTRATOR At the most , how much time do you feel you and your brother would require to get the house settled on its new plot ? HOUSE-MOVER Where is the plot ? ADMINISTRATOR We do n't know yet , but assuming the new plot is at the farthest point within the city limits , how much time would you and your brother require ? HOUSE-MOVER The farthest point would be close to six miles , and six miles according to our experience might take a little time . p. 8 ADMINISTRATOR How much time ? HOUSE-MOVER A month perhaps . Two hundred and fifty dollars for a month of horses would not be enough . ADMINISTRATOR Surely you and your brother could do it in a week , and two hundred and fifty dollars for a week of horses would be quite adequate . HOUSE-MOVER We had imagined a profit of some sort might have entered into the matter . ADMINISTRATOR A profit of some sort does enter into the matter . It enters into the matter in your keeping your business alive , in not losing an opportunity  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate to the people of our city your skill at moving houses . Move this house and I 'll wager you 'll have more houses to move than there are horses in Angels . Aghast to help you do it , and that means enlarging your business ! HOUSE-MOVER My brother and I have taken into account the advertising value of this particular job , but as I say the proposition is n't much better than a challenge . A man requires a great deal of plain food if he is to roll a house like this six miles , and plain food  --  the very plainest food  --  costs money . When there is n't a house to roll , my brother and I are satisfied to have only a reasonable amount of plain food , but when the job is upon us , and we 're rolling , we 're called upon to eat enormous amounts of plain food , and by plain food I mean bread , beans , greens , and the cheaper cuts of beef which we know how to prepare . p. 9 ADMINISTRATOR Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOUSE-MOVER My brother and I will take it if you 'll let us have it in full when we shake hands , but of course you understand we 'll be doing it for advertising purposes alone . ADMINISTRATOR Agreed , House-mover ! When the house is sold , we shall shake hands , you and your brother shall have your money in full , I shall go home to bed , and the day after tomorrow see the house on its way down the street , is that right ? HOUSE-MOVER That is right . URGE pauses in the street . AUCTIONEER ( Leaping to his feet ) Here , now ! Here comes somebody else . Ladies and gentlemen , the auction is open . Make a bid for this house as it stand , moved to where you want it within a reasonable amount of time free of charge , and let us all get along with our private lives . ( Shouting desperately ) Make a bid , friend , make a bid ! URGE ( Looking around ) Who ? AUCTIONEER You , friend ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy the house . I 've only come to see it . It is a handsome house , but such a house is not for me. p. 10 AUCTIONEER How many of you are there ? URGE Oh , seven of us . AUCTIONEER Ah ! Now , let me ask , you have work , an income , and you are a family together ? The HOUSE-MOVER 'S BROTHER arrives . URGE Oh , yes . I have a place in Sundown Slums , but I could never buy a house like this and move it there . HOUSE-MOVER ( To his BROTHER ) Sundown Slums ? That 's at the very edge of the city limits . That 's more than six miles as the crow flies , and the crow would have to fly straight through the heart of the city . ( To the ADMINISTRATOR ) A route like that with people watching all the time would require an enormous amount of plain food . AUCTIONEER Now , I want you to know the man who just spoke is a professional house-mover . He and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate to move this house safely to the place within the city limits of Angels Aghast designated and owned by the purchaser . These men , these house-movers , both of them under the house now , as you see , studying the problem , will move the house to its new location within a reasonable amount of time . Now , let me ask further , you have in Sundown Slums  --  what ? URGE A small house  --  not a house like this at all  --  and a place of business . p. 11 AUCTIONEER What sort of business , let me ask ? URGE Junkyard . AUCTIONEER Ah ! Now let me ask , friend , this junkyard is sufficiently spacious to accommodate the house that I am auctioning off to the public , is it not ? URGE Oh , the yard is big enough all right , but of course a good deal of the junk in the yard would have to be moved . AUCTIONEER ( Warming up ) I understand perfectly . Some of the junk must be moved  --  piled , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to make a point : you and your family would want the house as a home of course . That is to say , you would make certain minor repairs  --  using an item here and an item there from the yard itself  --  and then move into the house lock , stock and barrel . I mean , you must understand that the estate is permitted to sell the house only on condition that the house serves as a private dwelling for people . I might add , you would be permitted to entertain guests , although not for profit . You understand , I trust . URGE Oh , I understand all right , I would like the house for my family very much , but my business is not large or profitable . I finished paying for the yard last year , after twenty years . The little house I built myself is paid for , I have a fair assortment of junk in the yard , but very little money . I came only to see the house . p. 12 AUCTIONEER Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house where you want it , facing any direction you like  --  am I right , House-mover ?  --  free of charge and within a reasonable amount of time ? Now , let me hear a bid , please . HOUSE-MOVER I hope you understand that by a reasonable amount of time , my brother and I mean a measurement of time consistent with the laws and limits of physics , horse-power , and quantity of food we eat on the job , with scarcely any regard for quality . AUCTIONEER Oh , yes , I understand  --  a reasonable amount of time . HOUSE-MOVER Through the heart of the city , and with many problems . Narrow streets to be avoided , spectators to be gotten out of the way , possible dragging rather than rolling . And of course my brother and I could not be responsible for any damage to the house during the night while we are at home eating and reading . AUCTIONEER ( Impatiently ) Yes , those are all definite  --  Now , my friend , you 've heard for yourself , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for a rainy day ? URGE Oh , I 've got eighty or ninety dollars in the bank , a few dollars in the cigar box at the junkyard , a few nickels and dimes in the teapot in the cupboard  --  but I have n't come to make a bid on the house . I 'm sure somebody else will buy it . p. 13 AUCTIONEER Let me put it this way ? What is your name ? URGE My name is Urge  --  Utmost Urge . Ridiculous , I know , but I was born and christened so . Urge is a common name among my people . Utmost was my father 's idea . AUCTIONEER And your friends , they have a nickname for you , Mr. Urge ? Utmo , or Ut , perhaps ? I want us to understand one another . URGE I do n't believe I have a nickname . AUCTIONEER The reason I brought up the matter of nicknames , Mr. Urge , was to carry us into a friendly relationship . I 'd like you to know that my friends call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of my size and shape  --  and if you 'll think of me not as an auctioneer but as a friend  --  as Fatso  --  I 'll think of you as  --  well , Mr. Urge . Now , then . Let Fatso ask you as a friend , Mr. Urge , how much money have you got in your pocket ? Call me Fatso . URGE Oh , I 've got a dollar and fifty cents . I 'm to buy some wine for Sunday dinner , Fatso . AUCTIONEER Now , about water at Sunday dinner instead of wine , Mr. Urge . Why not bid a dollar and fifty cents and have the house instead of the wine ? Understand , delivered to the junkyard within a reasonable amount of time free of charge . p. 14 URGE A dollar and fifty cents for this house ? You must be joking . AUCTIONEER I assure you I 'm not joking ! I have here the necessary authorization to make the sale , the necessary papers calling for signatures  --  and the necessary witnesses ! Make your bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents for Sam Ego 's house , Mr. Auctioneer . AUCTIONEER ( He strikes the porch railing with his hammer ) Sold ! Sold to Mr. Utmost Urge ! The railing topples over into the weeds , half the porch creaks , groans , and slowly sinks several feet , forcing the HOUSE-MOVER to scramble to safety from under the porch . The AUCTIONEER leaps down the steps to shake hands with UTMOST , while the ADMINISTRATOR shakes hands with the HOUSE-MOVER . The BOY and GIRL come up the street dancing boogie to the radio jazz . p. 15 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene II Now , about forty-eight hours later , the hind end of SAM EGO 's house sticks out around a corner and blinks in the hot glaring light of sunset . The house has escaped from Rich Angel Street where it has stood for forty-five years and has plunged down Infant Angel Street . The names of the streets are on signposts , and another sign pointing down Infant Angel Street says , Sundown Slums , 6 miles . The ANGELS are more relaxed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bayonet has been removed from it . Large and small billboards stop the eye from seeing more than the hind end of the house or any of the neighborhood . The largest billboard advertises AN INSPIRED PICTURE : BACELY DANDER IN THE DIRTY DOG , WITH ANNA MOLE , AND INTRODUCING MISS GAY MUCKAGE ( ALMOST RHYMES WITH LUGGAGE ) , now playing at the Infant Angel . Bacely Dander has turned his back but not his head ( his profile shows ) on Anna Mole who lies in negligee on a floor , weeping and clutching a man 's shoe , and on Miss Muckage who , wearing the costume of a chorus girl , sits at a table in a night club , counting a stack of currency . Part of the advertisement says , Buy Bonds and Help Win the War . A GIRL of seven or eight with a piece of red crayon draws a moustache on Miss Mole 's upper lip , after which she draws moustaches of various styles and sizes all over Miss Mole and revises the Treasury Department 's share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She then writes , I am a girl . Smaller billboards advertise lipstick , perfume , soap , diamonds , furs , cigarettes , smoking pipes , razor blades , canned pork and beans , chewing gum , beer , whiskey , the Marine Corps , airplanes , and the new cola , Publicola ( The Favorite of the People ) . In every advertisement there is one pretty girl , half-naked , so that the scene swarms with female flesh larger than life . A basketball basket has been attached to the house and two small GIRLS are trying to toss empty cans into it . THREE OTHER GIRLS , all of them no more than six or seven , are skipping up and down the steps of the back porch . FOUR BOYS of eleven or twelve arrive with a basketball , which they dribble and pass to one another as they come . They drive the GIRLS away without a word , pushing or shoving them if they are big , or walking slowly after them if they are little , and then start a game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , play smartly , and make the basket quite often . A MAN in shirt-sleeves smoking a pipe comes along , glancing at the girls in the advertisements , lingering an extra moment near one of them . He compares Bacely Dander with himself , watches the basketball game , lights his pipe six or seven times , and then sits down on the steps of the back porch . A GIRL of seventeen or eighteen , bathed and fresh in a summer dress , comes walking down the street , her buttocks rolling helplessly . The MAN on the steps watches her until a match burns his fingers and goes out , and the BOYS stop the game . FIRST BOY Who 's that ? p. 16 SECOND BOY Ah , that 's my sister . THIRD BOY Your sister ? FOURTH BOY Since when does your sister walk like that ? SECOND BOY Do n't ask me . Come on , let 's play . FIRST BOY Does n't she even say hello to you when she sees you in the street ? SECOND BOY Naah . THIRD BOY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how come ? Come on , let 's play . FOURTH BOY What 's your hurry ? Does she talk to you when you 're at home ? SECOND BOY Sure she talks to me when I 'm at home . Why would n't she talk to me when I 'm at home ? FIRST BOY If she talks to you when you 're at home , why does n't she say hello to you when she sees you in the street ? SECOND BOY For the love of Mike , if we 're going to play , let 's play . Maybe she does n't say hello to me in the street because she does n't want the whole world to know I 'm her brother . THIRD BOY Why not ? Is she too good to be your sister just because she walks that way ? SECOND BOY Ah , lay off , will you ? She ca n't help the way she walks . Things happen to girls as they get older . p. 17 FOURTH BOY I 'll say they do ! Wo n't say hello to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I had a sister like that I 'd beat her up . SECOND BOY Lay off , will you ? What do I care if she does n't say hello when she sees me in the street ? I did n't say hello to her , did I ? THIRD BOY That 's different . You were in the game . SECOND BOY Come on , come on , give me the ball and let 's get going.He tries to take the ball out of the hands of the FOURTH BOY , who hangs onto the ball and pivots . FOURTH BOY Take it easy . What 's the matter , ashamed to talk about your sister just because she walks like that ? SECOND BOY Who wants to talk about the way my sister walks , for the love of Mike ? THIRD BOY You must be blind . Have n't you ever watched her walk ? SECOND BOY What do I care how my sister walks ? FIRST BOY I never saw anybody roll the way she rolls . THIRD BOY You just know she knows everybody watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get a roll like that from sitting . FIRST BOY A roll like that just do n't happen by itself . p. 18 THIRD BOY You just know she knows she 's got a roll like that . FIRST BOY I once saw a colored girl with a roll that was n't half as big as that . THIRD BOY If I had a sister with a roll like that who would n't say hello to me in the street , I 'd catch her coming out of the bathroom some night and teach her some manners . FOURTH BOY What I 'd do to a sister like that who would n't say hello to me ! FIRST BOY Ever see your sister come out of the bathroom at night ? SECOND BOY Sure I 've seen her . We live in the same house . I 've seen her all my life . THIRD BOY Does she roll that way coming out of the bathroom ? FIRST BOY Do you see her naked ? FOURTH BOY I 'd teach her some manners if she came out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bathroom naked . She comes out in a bathrobe . I do n't have to teach my sister any manners . THIRD BOY Well , if you do n't , somebody does ! FIRST BOY Some day somebody 's going to teach a girl like that a lot of manners . p. 19 FOURTH BOY Beat her up good ! SECOND BOY You guys lay off my sister ! She 's got manners ! Just lay off her , that 's all ! THIRD BOY What are you getting tough about ? Who do you think your sister is anyway ? FIRST BOY Since when do you come around telling us what we can talk about and what we ca n't talk about ? FOURTH BOY Do you think your sister is somebody nobody can talk about ? SECOND BOY I said lay off ! THIRD BOY We do n't want to lay off . We want to talk about your sister . FIRST BOY What are you going to do about it ? FOURTH BOY Going to beat up the three of us for talking about your sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to beat the three of you up ! He swings at the FOURTH BOY , who ducks , pivots , catches him by the arm , while the THIRD BOY hits him from behind and knocks him down , and the FIRST BOY falls on him . The MAN on the porch stands and watches . FOURTH BOY ( As they fight ) Oh , yeah ? THIRD BOY We 'll teach you a little manners , too . p. 20 FIRST BOY ( Leaping on the SECOND BOY and laughing ) Poor little crying tough boy . Sister 's little lover . SECOND BOY ( Taking a beating ) I 'll show you dirty sons of bitches ! FIRST BOY ( Lifting him up ) Show us your sister coming out of the bathroom naked . FOURTH BOY ( Pushing the SECOND BOY 'S head swiftly many times ) Poor little crying boy , crying for his sister . SECOND BOY ( Kicking and crying ) I 'll get you sons of bitches , you wait and see ! THIRD BOY Wait till we get your sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can watch us do it .

FIRST BOY We 're going to teach your sister a little manners , too . p. 21 SECOND BOY I thought you sons of bitches were decent ! THIRD BOY Look whose sister 's decent ! FIRST BOY Poor little crying boy ! SECOND BOY I thought you bastards would want to be decent , the way any decent fellow would want to be ! FOURTH BOY ( Grabbing the SECOND BOY as he almost wrenches himself free ) Not yet , crying boy ! We 'll let you go home when we get good and ready !

( They struggle in silence . ) FOURTH BOY I 'll rest awhile . You two guys wear him down . ( He disengages himself from the struggle , lights a cigarette , smokes it casually. ) p. 22 SECOND BOY I 'll get you sons of bitches , you wait and see ! I 'll get every one of you ! ( He is almost exhausted , and his sobbing has almost stopped ) I thought you wanted to be decent . You 're decent when you play basketball . ( He stops struggling , and the OTHERS relax their holds a little . The excitement begins to wear away . The SECOND BOY looks down helplessly as he tries to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ) I thought you guys were my friends . I thought I 'd do anything for you guys , and I thought you 'd do anything for me . I 've known every one of you all my life , you dirty bastards ! I thought we were all decent . You guys are dogs , you dirty stinking yellow dogs ! If two of you guys jumped on one of us , I 'd fight against you . I would n't be a dirty dog like you dirty dogs ! ( The BOYS drop their arms . The SECOND BOY stands free . He looks up at the THIRD BOY , who is ashamed to look him in the face ) I thought you were my best friend ! THIRD BOY I 'm sorry .

He tries again , then stops and turns to the FIRST BOY ) All right , get in the game ! What 's the matter with you ? FIRST BOY I do n't feel like playing . ( The FIRST BOY watches the THIRD BOY walk off . The FOURTH BOY passes the FIRST BOY the ball very swiftly . He catches it and throws it away ) I said I do n't feel like playing , did n't I ?

He picks up the ball , as the HOUSE-MOVER and his BROTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear coveralls whose many pockets are weighted down with all kinds of working tools . The FOURTH BOY bounces the ball as he returns to the basket . He is about to try for another basket when he changes his mind . He walks off slowly . The HOUSE-MOVER and his BROTHER stand before one of the billboards and study the picture of the girl on it . They bring out cigarettes , light them , inhale , exhale , and begin examining the rollers on which the house rests . The MAN on the steps lights his pipe , puffs at it , gets up slowly , yawns , and goes off . The HOUSE-MOVER and his BROTHER get under the house . The little GIRL with the red crayon comes back and continues her drawing of moustaches . The HOUSE-MOVER and his BROTHER begin a duet of hammering under the house . The little GIRL turns and listens a moment and then prints the word Me on a billboard . The hammering takes on a rhythm which gradually grows swift , and acquires form . The other little GIRLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket , and dance up and down the steps of the house . It is almost night now . The BOY and the GIRL in the red-white-and-blue jersey sweaters come along and dance to the rhythm of the HOUSE-MOVERS ' hammering . The SECOND BOY 'S SISTER comes back on her way home , rolling her buttocks , followed by a YOUNG MAN who looks something like Bacely Dander . She carries two books which are obviously library books , and she looks straight ahead as she walks . HOUSE-MOVER 'S BROTHER crawls to the edge of the house to watch her walk . The YOUNG MAN brings his thumb and forefinger together for the BROTHER as commentary on the perfectly wonderful way the girl walks . BROTHER scrambles out from under the house to stand in the street and look , with his mouth open . The HOUSE-MOVER scrambles after his BROTHER and stands with him and watches . The little GIRLS stop playing and dancing . The LOVERS in jersey sweaters walk off . The HOUSE-MOVERS sit on the steps of the porch and once again light cigarettes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOUSE-MOVERS stare at the pictures of the girls in the advertisements . The street light comes on . Three radio programs come into hearing range simultaneously . One is a concerto for piano and orchestra ; one is a soprano singing ; one is a man 's voice in speech . The programs blend almost as if they were meant to do so . After awhile the man 's voice and manner of speech is faintly recognizable . He is saying something about Nagasaki . The HOUSE-MOVERS listen attentively . The soprano sings and the piano and the orchestra play . UTMOST , carrying a tool-kit , appears with EASY URGE , a boy of eleven or twelve . The father takes pride in the house , and EASY is amazed that it is now theirs . UTMOST opens his tool-kit and takes out a hammer and a handful of nails , and with them tightens a loose board . The HOUSE-MOVERS finish their cigarettes , take up their hammers , crawl back under the house , and begin hammering again .

Now a portion of one side of the house and just a little of the back porch is open to view , the remainder of the house being hidden by trees and the rear end of the church . Two windows of the lower floor of the house and two of the upper are in view , the panes of all of them broken almost to the frames . The window of the Minister 's study looks across to the upper windows of the house . All is dark and still , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church trees . The ANGELS are now in battle dress . Their faces are dirty and they are desperate and weary . The church SEXTON , a man of seventy or so with a gruff , casual manner as if he were always angry about something but not too angry , arrives at the back door of the church , unlocks it , enters the church , and a moment later lifts the lower half of the window of the Minister 's study to let in fresh air . He stands at the window a moment , looking out at the broken windows of SAM EGO 'S house , then disappears . When he is gone SAM EGO , the old man with the white beard who was seen by EASY entering the house , appears at one of the upper windows . He is shaking with what appears to be silent laughter , but he is not by any means a frightening man to see . He thrusts his head out of the window , apparently looking for someone . When the SEXTON reappears in the Minister 's study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEXTON leaves the study , closing the door behind him , SAM EGO reappears at the window again , thrusts his head out and looks around . EASY , the junkman 's boy , comes along carrying a full paper sack . EGO ( Whispering ) There you are , my boy ! But quiet now , there 's someone in the church . Be ready if he should appear in that window or down below there , like the sharp fellow you are . ( EASY nods ) You 've told no one ? ( EASY shakes his head ) I knew you would n't . Not even your father , or your mother , or the dearest person you know in all the world , whoever that might be ? ( EASY shakes his head ) You 're not afraid ? ( EASY shakes his head ) You know I 'm only an old man who 's done no more than come to his own house ? ( EASY nods ) Then come up with the food you 've brought , but quiet ! ( He motions ) Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning now and I 've been starved all night . Put the parcel in the place we know . I 'll get it all and take it where I go to eat and sleep and not be found , my boy . They 'll come looking for me soon , but only you and I know I 'm here , and only I know the place . I 'd tell you where it is , but plenty of time for that , my boy . Around the back , then , like the fearless fellow you are . I 'm famished and weak . You 've brought plenty of bread and a bottle of water ? ( EASY nods ) Up softly , then , and again tomorrow . Good-bye , my boy . ( SAM EGO disappears into the house . ) EASY looks around , then hurries to the back door , unlocks it , and goes in . The SEXTON comes out of the church with a broom and begins to sweep , as the light of the sun begins to make the day Sunday . The HOUSE-MOVER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 25 SEXTON ( Leaning on his broom ) Now , you 're not going to make a racket with your moving on the Sabbath , are you ? You 're not going to have the Sabbath a shambles of hammering and hollering at horses and creaking and groaning and not moving the house more than an inch the whole day , are you ? The Pastor needs a lot of peace and quiet when it 's time to give his sermon . You might have dragged the awful house another way , alongside the church of the Baptists , or the Episcopalians , or the Methodists , or the Catholics , or the Jews , instead of the First Presbyterian . The Pastor 's sensitive to noise and stops his sermon if he hears so much as a sneeze in a handkerchief . And where are the horses now ? HOUSE-MOVER They 'll be out front before long , brought by my brother . SEXTON ( Outraged ) Out front ? Out front to do what ? To drag this wreckage on the Sabbath ? Four sick and hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good health and well-fed . They brought the house this far , and my brother and I , we 've added two more to the team . SEXTON Oh , you have ? Well , the Pastor is n't going to like the noise of them . It 's no noise for the peace of the Sabbath . And what do you think you 'll be doing to the Sunday School classes ? p. 26 HOUSE-MOVER My brother and I hope to move the house a little before the Sunday School classes begin . SEXTON Oh , you do , do you ? And how do you mean to do it ? HOUSE-MOVER By the principles and laws of physics which we have studied . SEXTON Well , you 've had the house sitting here since yesterday morning at nine by the principles and laws of physics , have n't you ? HOUSE-MOVER We found a flaw in our system of ropes and pulleys , but we 've corrected the flaw and we hope to move the house a considerable distance before Sunday School classes begin . What time do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at half-past nine . And what about the choir ? Will they ever be heard ? Where will your hammering and hollering be in five hours when the choir begins to sing ? In Sundown Slums , I suppose , where you 're dragging the miserable house ! HOUSE-MOVER My brother and I estimate we can move the house to the next corner in four hours . SEXTON And is the Pastor so deaf he ca n't hear your hammering and hollering from there ? HOUSE-MOVER Only faintly . SEXTON Oh . And you 're right under the Pastor 's study , where he makes his notes and gathers his thoughts together . What thoughts is he going to be able to gather together with you and your brother hammering and hollering and your six horses thrashing about and slipping and falling all over the place ? EASY comes up from the front of the house and stands beside the HOUSE-MOVER. p. 27 HOUSE-MOVER The Pastor might gather together some thoughts about what will it profit a man if he gaineth the world and loseth his soul , as the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered , from what I 've heard about him . SEXTON And just what is it that you 've heard about him ? That he lost his soul ? I heard he lost his wits . And he did n't gain the world in the first place  --  not by a long shot . He was a lawyer and a good one , and before he lost his wits I knew him well . I knew him as well as I know anybody in Angels Aghast , as well as I know the Pastor I 've served these thirty years . Sam Ego and myself are men of the same age , allowing two or three years one way or the other , and so is the Pastor , God help him on this Sabbath day . HOUSE-MOVER He was a rich man to build a house like this , and being rich is what they mean by gaining the world . A mind lost is no different and no better than a soul lost . SEXTON Oh , is n't it ? And who is it says the soul needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? HOUSE-MOVER My brother and I believe the mind is the best thing to hang onto that a man has . We believe a mind hung onto and cultivated can fix a man up with a new soul  --  a better one than the one he started out with . We 're both men who live in the life of the mind . p. 28 SEXTON You 're both imbeciles ! What mind do you think it is that you live in ? What mind is there to a man who crawls under a house eaten with rot , hammering on the foundations and hollering to his brother ? HOUSE-MOVER My brother and I move houses in order to earn the few dollars we require for plain food . It 's honorable work and not beneath us because we 've strong bodies and live in the life of the mind . If the lawyer whose proud house this once was had n't pushed and crashed after the empty things of life and neglected his mind and the minds of his wife and children , perhaps my brother and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who is it says Sam Ego pushed and crashed after the things you say he pushed and crashed after ? You ? The man was overtaken , as any man might be . He was overtaken , Lord help him . ( Suddenly ) And this boy here who 's been listening all this time , who 's he , to be up and about at this hour of the morning ? HOUSE-MOVER This is the son of the man who 's bought the house at public auction . His name 's Easy . His father 's name is Urge . He 's a lively boy , with a good mind , and helps me under the house for the experience of it . SEXTON Is this the junkman 's boy ? p. 29 HOUSE-MOVER One of several . The others are in the Army , the Navy , and the Marines . SEXTON I 've met your father , boy . I 've been to his yard on errands for the Pastor , but why could n't he have taken the house to pieces where it stood instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Urge bought the house to live in . SEXTON Live in ? Has your father lost his wits too , boy ? ( To the HOUSE-MOVER ) The house is cursed , besides being filthy . A quarter of a century of lonely men and woebegone women have slinked in and out of it , in search of peace and pathetic privacy . No wonder no one bought the house all these years ! HOUSE-MOVER Mr. Urge and his boy here have gone to a great deal of trouble to sweep out the house , and my brother and I have gone through the house with them and found it clean and tight . It is old , and no doubt it has been visited by unhappy people from time to time , but the house itself , apart from local folk-lore , is still sound enough to be restored and happily occupied by decent people , such as Mr. Urge , his wife , and his children . The house will lose its fame when it reaches Sundown Slums . Having been built where vanity was all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but when the house settles down where vanity is nothing , they will not hate it  --  or themselves for rejoicing in the disgrace of that which they envy . The house will no longer be Sam Ego 's house and will no longer signify to the people the fearful end to which things pass . It will be the home of a plain family and the emblem of humble honor . My brother and I have talked at great length about all this , in the midst of our eating and reading , after work in the evenings . p. 30 SEXTON ( A little confused ) Oh . ( Pause , wanting to be right , or at any rate to seem to be ) I did not mention the awful ghosts that haunt the house . What about them ? HOUSE-MOVER I 'll not say there are no ghosts , and I 'll not say ghosts have never haunted this house , but if there are ghosts and if some of them have haunted this house , I 'm satisfied they 'll never care to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of people so reasonable as the members of the Urge family.A PAPER-CARRIER comes by with his loaded sacks and hands the SEXTON a paper , glances at the house , and goes along . SEXTON The Pastor 's Sunday paper , to help him prepare his sermon . I 'll put it on his desk ( Suddenly ) What 's this ? ( Reading the headline ) Noted Lunatic Escapes . ( He looks meaningfully at the house , at the HOUSE-MOVER and at the boy EASY ) The noted lunatic is Sam Ego of course , though he was never noted as a lunatic but as a lawyer . ( He glances at the paper and reads another line ) Sam Ego At Large Three Days . Poor Sam , he 's no more at large than any of us , he 's simply wandered away from the Asylum , as any of us would do . I 'd say he 'd got his wits back at last , to do that . He was never mad anyway , he just could n't stop laughing , and the Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , if he 'd cried , I suppose they 'd have decided he was perfectly all right . ( He reads some more from the paper ) Seventy-five-year-old former leading citizen of Angels Aghast , Sam Ego , for the past twenty-five years hopelessly insane , sometime last Wednesday night escaped from the County Lunatic Asylum where he has always been a model inmate , and is still at large . Mr. Ego 's affliction is characterized by trembling of the body as he apparently laughs to himself . He wears a fleecy white beard not unlike the one seen in photographs of the great poet of the people , Walt Whitman . Mr. Ego , although heretofore harmless , may now be dangerous , authorities at the Asylum declared last night in making formal announcement of his escape . Search for the lunatic has been secret and fruitless so far , but a city-wide search on the part of the entire police force , the fire department , and all troops of the Boy Scouts will begin early Sunday morning . Authorities at the Asylum are not sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches with which to set fire to the city . When questioned whether the lunatic had ever before used matches to set fire to any of the buildings of the Asylum , the authorities replied that he had n't , but that there was no telling what he might do . Mr. Ego 's famous house in Sunup Heights was recently sold at public auction at an undisclosed figure to an undisclosed buyer who was willing to comply with the terms of purchase established by Mr. Ego while he was still sane . Named Ego 's Rest by the lunatic when the house was built at the turn of the century , the house was renamed Eagle 's Nest by the people in 1919 when the lunatic 's son , just back from France in World War I , was killed in an automobile accident , Mr. Ego 's wife committed suicide , and his daughter died in child-birth , all of which unbalanced Mr. Ego 's mind . The famous building is now en route from Rich Angel Street in Sunup Heights where it has stood forty-five years to Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by a family of seven . The choice land on which the house has stood for so long is presently to be sold as a site for a moving picture theatre . Citizens of Angels Aghast have watched the moving of the house with curious interest , and may now find it not far from the First Presbyterian Church on Old Angel Street . p. 31 HOUSE-MOVER They should n't have said that . My brother and I do n't like a lot of people hanging around when we 're working because they always excite the horses . SEXTON The Pastor is n't going to like it , either . The whole Sabbath is going to be shot to hell with police , firemen , Boy Scouts , and you and your brother . Well , where is the man with the horses ? Get the house down the street to the next corner at least , before the whole city turns up . ADMINISTRATOR ( Running up , panting for breath ) I 'm an early riser , and I 've read the paper . Where 's Mr. Urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on the house and tear it to pieces looking for the lunatic . I 've got to have a talk with your father . Where is he ? URGE He said he would be here around six . ADMINISTRATOR Thank God for that . We 've got to act and act quick ! ( The AUCTIONEER shows up , running and out of breath ) I 'm sorry I had to get you out of bed , but thank God you 're here ! AUCTIONEER Has anyone seen him ? ADMINISTRATOR He 's on his way here . p. 32 AUCTIONEER You have n't seen him ? ADMINISTRATOR No , but this is his boy . AUCTIONEER Whose boy ? ADMINISTRATOR The junkman 's of course . AUCTIONEER Has anyone seen the lunatic ? ADMINISTRATOR Not yet , but we 'll be searching the house as soon as the junkman arrives . ( He turns to EASY ) You understand , boy , that we 'll be doing it in order to protect your father 's property from the mob when it arrives . They 'll want to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually they 'll be doing it for the devil of it . And while they 're at it they 'll tear the house down . Is that clear , boy ? Now , if we search the house before the mob arrives , we will be in a position to assure the police and the firemen and the Boy Scouts that the lunatic is not in the house , and thereby restrain them from destroying your father 's property . Have I made myself clear ? URGE I guess so . ADMINISTRATOR You 've been in the house with your father , I hope . You 've explored the rooms and the halls and the closets and every edge and corner in which a man might hide , and you 'll be able to lead us about in our search for the lunatic ? p. 33 HOUSE-MOVER The boy and his father know the house well , having given it a thorough cleaning from top to bottom . ADMINISTRATOR Good . But we 'll need all the strength we have if the lunatic 's in the house . SEXTON If poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a little humanity in your heart . Sam Ego made his fame as a lawyer defending the accused from the state . If he was mistaken in his sentiments about the guilt or innocence of law-breakers or about the responsibility of the state not to commit crimes against them , he was certainly never guilty of anything more foolish than soft-heartedness , and a respectable amount of vanity . Have you brought a rope with which to tie the poor man ? He 's been laughing since 1919 . Perhaps if you saw yourself and the rest of the people of Angels Aghast as he probably does , you 'd laugh too . ADMINISTRATOR That may very well be , but the paper says the man has matches and is dangerous . SEXTON The paper says he may have matches and may be dangerous . For a penny any man in the world may buy a box of matches , and no man  --  not even the Pastor himself  --  is not dangerous . It 's the bouncing Boy Scouts I 'm scared to death of , not Sam Ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mouth ) I 've got the horses out front if you 're ready to give the new system of ropes and pulleys a try . p. 34 ADMINISTRATOR Horses ! ? You 're not thinking of trying to move the house now , in face of the lunatic being at large and possibly in the house ? BROTHER What lunatic ? HOUSE-MOVER The man who built the house , Sam Ego . He 's run away from the Lunatic Asylum . BROTHER ( To the ADMINISTRATOR ) My brother and I are paying good money to the stables for the use of the horses , and I think my brother will agree with me that it is no affair of ours who 's at large or in the house . We 've got to move the house and we 've got to move it quick if we 're not going to come out of this thing hungry and in debt . ADMINISTRATOR Quite right , no doubt . Let me ask  --  you 've spent quite a bit of the two hundred and fifty dollars ? HOUSE-MOVER Eighty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than a mile . We 're glad to be doing the work of course , but we had n't figured on not using the horses when we 're paying for them . ADMINISTRATOR Fair 's fair , and what you say is fair , but a lunatic at large with the whole city likely to turn out after him , like hounds after the hare , and all of them headed in the direction of this house  --  what does that mean in terms of simple arithmetic ? Excitement , riot , and in all probability wreckage . p. 35 HOUSE-MOVER Wreckage ? ADMINISTRATOR Precisely . The precise point I 've wanted to make  --  wreckage  --  the whole house a shambles . As administrator of the estate I have a very important announcement to make . ( Slowly and over-emphatically ) The house must not be destroyed . If the house is destroyed , by whatever means , whether accident , act of God , vandalism , fire , or whatever , my annual fee is forfeit , along with all commissions from the sale of the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , for which I have received a very attractive offer , as well as all fees from miscellaneous and sundry other properties belonging to the estate , and so on and so forth . HOUSE-MOVER Oh . ADMINISTRATOR Let me put it this way . The house must safely reach Sundown Slums and be occupied by Mr. Urge and his family . That is the basic requirement of the estate , by which I am employed . BROTHER Which is exactly what my brother and I hope to do , with the help of the horses . AUCTIONEER Not to mention that this boy 's father is entitled to have the property he has bought at public auction and now owns protected from the mob . ADMINISTRATOR And as soon as his father arrives , we shall conduct our search of the house , declare it out of bounds , obtain adequate police protection for the house , whereupon you and your brother may proceed to move it to Sundown Slums. p. 36 SEXTON Why do n't you stop your jabbering and go on into the house , get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away ? The Pastor is n't going to like a demonstration during his sermon . ADMINISTRATOR If the lunatic is found , he will be returned to the County Asylum . If he is not found , I myself will obtain the necessary police and other protection from the Mayor himself , with whom I have already had a preliminary discussion by telephone.A speeding fire-engine is heard , its bell ringing and its siren wailing . The sound draws closer , skidding is heard , and THREE FIREMEN in uniform and helmets , each of them carrying crowbars and axes , come running . The terrified crying of horses is heard , and the stamping of hooves . FIRST FIREMAN Break the door down ! BROTHER The horses ! For God 's sake , the horses ! ( He jackrabbits around the house , followed by the HOUSE-MOVER . ) ADMINISTRATOR ( Screaming ) Stop ! There 's no need to break the door down . The house is not on fire ! SECOND FIREMAN ( At the back door ) Who says it ai n't ? ADMINISTRATOR I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door 's not locked . p. 37 THIRD FIREMAN Then let 's go in and put out the fire . ( They disappear inside the house . ) AUCTIONEER ( Stunned ) Boogie boogie boogie ! UTMOST comes along . EASY runs to him , pointing to the house , and they hurry to the ADMINISTRATOR , the AUCTIONEER and the SEXTON . Axes chopping into wood are now heard , and the creaking of boards giving way to crowbars . ADMINISTRATOR ( Screaming ) Quick , Mr. Urge , go into the house and stop them ! It 's the fire department chopping the house down . URGE The fire department ? What for ? THREE BOY SCOUTS arrive at a trot , look around , and run into the house . AUCTIONEER Boogie boogie boogie ! The church bell begins to toll crazily , like a public alarm . SEXTON Now who the hell 's ding-donging the God-damn bell ? ( He rushes into the church . ) HOUSE-MOVER ( Running around the house , followed by a bewildered BOY SCOUT who looks around , runs up the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The horses have run away ! My brother 's gone to bring them back ! We tried our best to stop them , but they 're scared to death ! A crowd of people 's gathered out front ! The fire department 's broken down the front door , and the people are running in with the firemen , the police , and the Boy Scouts ! p. 38 AUCTIONEER ( Disgusted ) Boogie boogie boogie ! ADMINISTRATOR We 've got to think fast ! We 've got to stop them ! HOUSE-MOVER I 'm awfully sorry they 're wrecking your house , Mr. Urge . URGE What are they wrecking it for ? I planned to paint the living room this morning . HOUSE-MOVER You 'll find no more living room in that house , I 'm afraid . ADMINISTRATOR ( Taking UTMOST by the arm ) Fast , fast , fast ! Come with me to the police ! You own the house and you have the right to insist on having them protect it ! AUCTIONEER Boogie boogie boogie ! ( Five more BOY SCOUTS arrive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of their eager faces and busy , small , uniformed bodies ) Good God Almighty , protect us ! ( The ADMINISTRATOR , the AUCTIONEER , the HOUSE-MOVER and UTMOST URGE hurry around the house ) If it 's not the boogie boogie , it 's the brave Boy Scouts ! ( The GROUP is met by FOUR more of them ) Oh , Jesus , have mercy on us ! They disappear . The FOUR BOY SCOUTS run about in silence , bumping into one another , while EASY watches them . Finally they disappear into the house , one of them suddenly blowing on a police whistle as they go . The SEXTON stumbles out of the back door of the church , shaking with silent laughter at what he has seen . The BOY SCOUT with the whistle appears at the second floor window , blowing the whistle with all his might . He sees the SEXTON shaking with laughter and takes the whistle out of his mouth . p. 39 BOY SCOUT WITH WHISTLE There he is , men ! I 've found the lunatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper said ! Go get him , men ! ( The stunned SEXTON looks up at the window , dives back into the church , locks the door behind him , as the BOY SCOUTS come out of the house and charge the door ) I 've found the lunatic ! He 's in the church ! URGE That 's not the lunatic . The lunatic 's got a white beard . BOY SCOUT WITH WHISTLE ( Screaming ) The lunatic 's shaved off his beard ! I 've found the lunatic ! He 's in the church ! The BOY SCOUTS beat on the door , as the SEXTON appears at the window of the MINISTER 'S study , terrified , but unable to stop shaking . One of the SCOUTS sees him in the window . BOY SCOUT WITH WHISTLE There he is , men ! Break the door down ! Capture the lunatic ! ( The SEXTON disappears . ) URGE That 's the church janitor.The SCOUTS break the door open and rush into the church , as more SCOUTS arrive and follow them . Churchbells , fire-engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crowbar creaking blend together into a kind of ridiculous and terrifying celebration of heroic imbecility . The SEXTON rushes out of the church , but is tackled by a HALF DOZEN BOY SCOUTS , who put him down and hold him , as POLICE and FIREMEN come running . p. 40 POLICE We 've captured the lunatic ! ( He blows his whistle . ) URGE That 's not the lunatic , that 's the church janitor . The SEXTON struggles to get free and more people , including GIRLS and WOMEN , come running to help capture the lunatic . p. 41 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene II Five hours later order has been restored , and the churchbell tolls peacefully and properly . A line has been established and a crowd of PEOPLE , including the ANGELS , now wearier than ever , is standing behind a rope , patrolled by THREE BOY SCOUTS . The SEXTON is sitting on a chair in the sunlight , still stunned and still shaking with what is certainly not laughter . The SEXTON 'S forehead is bandaged , his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with iodine . The PASTOR is trying to control himself , to look reverent , and to give the SEXTON his full moral support all at the same time , along with an occasional half-smile and half-nod to someone behind the rope he thinks has noticed him and nodded . A very small but efficient BOY SCOUT is swiftly putting a bandage on the SEXTON 'S left hand and arm up to the elbow . The SEXTON is trying his best to sit still , but the sight of the little BOY disgusts him . The worst of it is , the BOY knows what he is doing . Even so , every now and then the SEXTON slaps at him with his free hand , and once knocks scissors out of his hand . UTMOST and his son EASY are painting the house white , beginning with that part of the side wall which is within easy reach . They work peacefully and thoughtfully , as if they were at home , and alone . The PASTOR occasionally glances toward them and sighs ever so slightly , not approving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiving them . They work quietly , though , and the PASTOR 'S thankful for that . The HOUSE-MOVER is under the house working out a problem . Every now and then he does a little hammering , as little , it would seem , as possible , and as quietly as possible , whereupon the SEXTON gets to his feet and shakes and mumbles to himself , while the PASTOR looks upward and just barely tries to clear the inside of his head of something or other by pressing his hands against the outside . And then gently urges the SEXTON to sit down again . The Sunday birds in the church trees are busy warbling now , and the PASTOR accepts full responsibility for them each time they do so , his face brightening charitably  --  they are only unreasoning birds . He smiles and bows to somebody behind the line after a bird negotiates a rather complicated melody with almost perfect success . Presbyterian , the PASTOR 'S manner implies . The church organ begins to play just as the HOUSE-MOVER and his BROTHER begin to ask and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as you can ! Got it ? p. 42 BROTHER Got it ! HOUSE-MOVER Start the horses very slowly ! Do n't let them hurry ! Got it ? BROTHER Got it ! Giddap ! HOUSE-MOVER Easy , now ! Easy ! Easy ! Slower ! Slower ! Stop the horses , stop the horses ! BROTHER Whoa !  --  whoa !  --  hold on there ! HOUSE-MOVER No ! We 're not ready yet ! Be a minute or two more . Stay where you are ! Got it ? BROTHER Got it ! ( The HOUSE-MOVER begins to hammer just as the choir breaks into song . ) PASTOR ( Holding his hand out toward the HOUSE-MOVER ) Please , men ! The opening hymn ! The HOUSE-MOVER hammers louder than ever , as the whole congregation joins the choir in singing the opening hymn . Little by little the HOUSE-MOVER 'S hammering wears the choir and congregation down , the singing falters , then stops , and only the usual brave , hysterical soprano goes on alone a bar or two . When she stops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a rage he has to be bodily restrained by the PASTOR from charging under the house after the HOUSE-MOVER.The CHOIR LEADER , a lady of sixty or so , obviously maiden , comes out of the church in tears , angry and hurt , and beseeches the PASTOR to do something . The PASTOR comforts her , walking her up and down . The hammering stops , and the PASTOR sends the CHOIR LEADER back into the church . p. 43 HOUSE-MOVER ( Shouting ) All set here now ! Ready out there ? ( The organ begins to play again . ) BROTHER Ready here ! HOUSE-MOVER Drive the horses just a bit to the right , but easy ! Slowly ! All right now , take up the slack ! Slower , now ! ( Groanings and creakings are heard ) That 's it ! That 's just right now ! ( The choir begins to sing . The HOUSE-MOVER shouts at the top of his voice ) Hold on a bit ! Hold on , now ! No ! No ! Stop the horses ! Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time they are ready for battle and the volume of sound is so great that the HOUSE-MOVER can barely be heard , as the PASTOR smiles , holds his head on one side a moment , listens , lifts it heavenward , and then smiles and nods to a BOY SCOUT with pimples all over his face.UTMOST and EASY listen to the HOUSE-MOVER and his BROTHER , and when it seems as if the man under the house is not being heard by the man in charge of the horses EASY runs around to the front of the house , and UTMOST goes to look after the man under it . After a moment the URGES return to their paint and brushes and go on with their work.The PASTOR takes the notes for his sermon out of his pocket and examines them , his face filling with lines of thought . He strides into the church , to go to work and earn his poor living . The singing stops and all is relatively silent.The BOY SCOUT finishes his first-aid work on the SEXTON , stands at attention before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disgusted , infuriated and ready for murder ) What do you want ? BOY SCOUT WITH WHISTLE To serve my country , help maintain the peace , be a credit to my parents , and turn in more than my quota of salvage and waste fats . ( The SCOUT finishes the salute . ) SEXTON Ah , you make me sick ! ( He threatens the SCOUT with lifted arm , but the SCOUT stands firm and fearless ) By God , if it 's more trouble you 're looking for  --  you and your brave little friends in your neat little uniforms  --  I 'll give you all you want , old , wounded and trampled-on as I am ! Get away from me , the lot of you ! The SCOUT begins to back away , while the THREE OTHER SCOUTS watch with apprehension , drawing up to help . One of them puts a whistle to his mouth . SEXTON Blow that whistle , so much as breathe on it , and I 'll make you eat it ! You 've won the war , now get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddle ) No , no ! No council ! Just pick up your little bodies and go . I 'm not going to have any more of you.The huddle fails , and the SCOUTS begin to be more or less normal , more or less themselves , little boys full of doubt about themselves instead of charging heroes in a campaign whose righteousness is unquestionable  --  little boys facing the wrath of an angry old man , who somehow , alone and unorganized , is more right and mightier than their whole group , or any group , drilled , trained , organized , always together , and always safe but silly in their togetherness . He tugs at the bandage on his left arm , tears it off and uses it as a weapon with which to start the rout of the enemy . p. 45 SEXTON Get away ! Run for your lives ! The Pastor 's not here to stop me , you know ! Run home and ask your parents to be your parents instead of the imbeciles they are to let you run amuck in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . It 's one by one or not at all ! ( He takes down the rope behind which the PEOPLE are standing and throws it among the SCOUTS , who bolt and run as normal boys almost caught stealing apples do ) That 's right ! You 've made a beginning at last ! You may still turn out to be men ! ( He turns with scorn on the PEOPLE who have been standing behind the rope ) And what the devil do you mean standing there like cattle ? Go on , get away from here with your sheep 's faces , grown men and women of a free nation bullied every minute , and glad to be ! ( The PEOPLE turn and go , excepting the ANGELS , who obviously can not be seen . They fall down to sleep , exhausted ) It 's your children who make fools of you and themselves . Go home and think about it.The PEOPLE are gone now . The SEXTON surveys the scene , watches the URGES applying paint to the house , bends to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment to the organ , takes up his broom and begins to sweep , as if he wanted to sweep away the harrowing experience he has been through . A new BOY SCOUT , a late riser , walking alone , calm and unexcited and dreaming peacefully , comes by to have a look at the house . The SEXTON lifts his broom and swings at the SCOUT , who leaps like a startled deer and takes to the woods , with the SEXTON chasing after him part of the way . The SEXTON stands still a long time , apparently thinking terrible thoughts , then takes to sweeping again . The PASTOR appears at the open window of his study just as the organ begins the offeratory solo : a very sweet and touching piece , somehow intended to serve as the accompaniment to the passing of the collection plate and the dropping of small coins onto it . The PASTOR hists at the SEXTON , who stops sweeping and looks up . p. 46 PASTOR I shall preach now . Please ask the house-movers to be silent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attendance is very poor , scarcely more than two dozen . The ushers are taking the collection now . I 'm deeply distressed , for I have prepared a magnificent sermon , which I 'm afraid I must save for next Sunday , as it would be a pity to waste it . Instead , I 'll quote at random from the Good Book , and send the people home to Sunday dinner . ( He lifts his head , thinking , then recites ) Hearken unto this , O man : stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God . Job , thirty-seven , fourteen . There is much to ponder in that glorious line . ( He ponders some of it , then tries it again ) Hearken unto this , O man : stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God ! The URGES stop work to listen , and the HOUSE-MOVER comes around the house . HOUSE-MOVER Did somebody call me ? SEXTON No . The Pastor 's rehearsing his sermon . HOUSE-MOVER Oh , that ! He is about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything he 's got , almost . PASTOR God thundereth marvelously with his voice ! Great things doeth He , which we can not comprehend . ( The HOUSE-MOVER stops , turns and decides to listen a little ) God saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ! Likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain . ( The BROTHER appears , holding a stolid , half-asleep horse ) Out of the south cometh the whirlwind ; and cold out of the north . p. 47 BROTHER I believe this horse is sick of fear . HOUSE-MOVER The Pastor 's rehearsing his sermon ! ( The organ solo ends . ) PASTOR ( Plunging headlong into his work ) Dost thou know when God caused the light of His cloud to shine ? Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds , and the sky , which is like a looking-glass ? Though men see not the bright light which is in the clouds , His wind blows upon them , and fair weather cometh out of the west . BROTHER ( Softly ) Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Be still , man ! North or west , ca n't you see the Pastor 's gathering his thoughts ? PASTOR Wherefore , I pray thee , hearken unto my words . Behold , now I have opened my mouth . My tongue hath spoken in my mouth . My words are of the rightness of my heart . My lips utter truth clearly . The spirit of God made me . The breath of God gave me breath.The CHOIR LEADER stands behind the PASTOR fretfully , wanting to tell him the congregation is waiting for him to give his sermon , but afraid to interrupt him . She shakes her hands before her with exasperation , as if she were a little girl . PASTOR Behold , I am formed out of the clay . In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed , he openeth the ears of men , and giveth instruction , that men may learn the truth of themselves , that they are only men , but good things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all great and small , and full of eyes . p. 48 SEXTON To the pulpit now , Pastor ! Not here ! To the pulpit ! They 're waiting for you in the church ! PASTOR ( Alas , the PASTOR is off to the races , much aided by a failing memory ) Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ? They bow themselves , they bring forth their young , they cast out their sorrows . Their young are good looking , they grow up , they go forth , and return not . Wilt thou trust him whose strength is great ? The glory of his nostrils is terrible . He paweth in the valley , he rejoiceth on the hill . He mocketh at fear . He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he the sound of the trumpets . He saith among the trumpeters , Ha , ha ! Doth the eagle fly by wisdom to make her nest on high ? She dwelleth on the rock , upon the crag , in the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small coins on it comes out and stands near the HOUSE-MOVERS . He is followed by another USHER , and one by one by all of the PEOPLE in the church who are men , women , walking children , and babes in arms come out and stand in the yard . PASTOR Hearken unto me , O man : hold thy peace , and I will speak . Let us know among ourselves what is good , and who is virtuous . Let us know who drinketh up scorn like water . And who goeth in company with the workers in iniquity , and walketh with wicked men . Therefore hearken unto me , men of understanding : far be it from God , that he should do wickedness . And from the Almighty , that he should commit iniquity . The work of a man he shall tell him , and cause every man to find his way . God will not do wickedly , who hath given men charge over the earth , but if men dispose of it , cast down the whole world , deny his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men shall turn again into dust . If now thou hast understanding , hear this : Shall he that hateth right govern ? Is it fit to say to a king , Thou art wicked ? To a prince , Thou art ungodly ? God accepteth not the persons of princes , nor regardeth the rich more than the poor , for they are all the work of his hands . In a moment they shall die , and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and the mighty shall be taken away without hand . ( The HOUSE-MOVER nods to his BROTHER and each of them drops a small coin onto each of the collection plates ) His eyes are on the way of men , and he seeth all doings . There is no place where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves . He knoweth their works , and he overturneth them in the night , so that they are destroyed . He striketh wicked men in the open sight of others , because they send the cry of the poor unto him , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who then can make trouble , whether it be a whole nation , or one man alone ? ( A tired little GIRL is lifted gently by the HOUSE-MOVER and seated on the horse , and his BROTHER lifts a little BOY and seats him beside the GIRL , as if the back of the horse were a bench ) Behold , God is mighty , yet despiseth no man , but if thou art wicked , thy wickedness will hurt the man thou art . If thou art righteous , thy righteousness will profit thy son . He giveth songs in the night , and all things the beasts of the earth have not , and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven . He will not hear vanity . Hearken unto me , O man : say to thyself , If I have walked with vanity , then let me sow , and let another eat . If I have lifted my hand against the fatherless , when I saw my help in the gate , then let my arm fall from my shoulder and be broken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or have said to gold , Thou art my power , let thistles grow instead of wheat , and cockles instead of barley . Gird up thy loins like a man , saith the Lord . Clothe thyself with majesty . Array thyself with glory . Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath.SAM EGO appears at the window of the house , but is noticed only by EASY , who has been watching the window as if he believed the PASTOR were making his sermon to the man hiding in the house , and as if he were afraid the man might come to the window . EASY tries to motion SAM EGO back out of sight , but SAM EGO shakes his head , and EASY very quietly , as if the whole yard were church , makes his way unobtrusively to the back porch , and then into the house . p. 49 PASTOR Hearken unto this , O man : stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God.The PASTOR stops a moment to think , and EASY is seen in the second-floor window of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight . SEXTON ( Quickly to help restore order ) Amen ! And now , back into the church for the closing hymn and benediction ! The sermon 's over ! The PASTOR comes out of his trance , looks down with kindness upon the PEOPLE who , unlike himself , can not preach the gospel , and gently motions them back into the church , as if his doing so were a benediction . The PEOPLE dutifully file back into the church , the SEXTON bring up the rear , the HOUSE-MOVERS go back to work , taking the horse with them , and soon the organ is heard , and the choir and congregation singing . EASY comes out of the house with SAM EGO . They go to UTMOST . URGE This is my father . EGO ( Extending his hand ) Permit me to shake the hand of the father of this boy . My name is Sam Ego . Yes , I am the man . ( Pause ) Well , as I told your son upstairs , I 'll be going back now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stay . You need n't go back , and you need n't hide . You 've no affliction I can see . Stay in my home , and when this house reaches Sundown Slums , live in it , for it is your house . p. 50 EGO Oh , I am afflicted , there 's no doubt about that . URGE No doubt , but certainly no more than any of the rest of us . All living 's the same affliction , is it not ? Come with us to Sundown Slums . All my sons are at war , except this boy , and we can work together restoring the house . EGO No , it would n't do , though I must confess I am tempted , for I hoped to see a wondrous flourishing of life within this house , and my own  --  ( He shakes his head swiftly several times ) No , no , mine are all gone , and yours are only coming along . It would not do , though as I say I 'm tempted , tempted  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built this house and gave me hope to see a wondrous flourishing of life in it ? I never believed it was pride , but now I 've been so long among the caretakers of the mind , I do n't know . Now there is so very little I know . An hour ago if you were to have asked my name , I would not have known what to say , or would have said Eagle 's Son , or Sam Going , or something else thus tangled and blurred in the fading sound of things . I 've been cluttered by the caretakers , as you can imagine , and made feeble by the clawing of the eagle at my heart . I know my wit if not lunatic is surely light , but I think I remember that it was not pride that instructed me to build this house , nor vanity , nor being above anybody I ever knew . I swear to God , it was love ! ( He shakes his head very slowly ) Do you understand ? p. 51 URGE I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why I ask you to come with us to Sundown Slums , for there we may easily learn the way to be who we are . EGO Oh , I 'm tempted enough , the Lord knows that , and filled with fighting , the one side saying it 's proper to accept the good last chance you offer , the other side saying it would be wicked to name your charity my chance  --  and you must know  --  I must tell you  --  already I am filled with fretting for your sons . My only son came home from war and perished in the foolish streets , drunk from rejoicing , heedless with love  --  and killed for it in a fool 's accident . No , no , no ! The clutter , or the better wisdom I have learned from it , tells me that to fret is to compel , and already I fret for your sons ! To fear the worst is to create the worst . Worse still , to hope for the best is to soften the heart until fearing and fretting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in things ! Oh , I am cluttered , and would wish to be at your mercy , knowing that you would decide for me , but no , no , no , I must decide , and my decision must be to let you be ! I 'll be going along now . URGE ( Taking him by the arm and leading him around the house ) This is the way . A POLICE and TWO MEN come along , but do not see UTMOST and SAM EGO go into the house , as the SEXTON and the PASTOR come out of the church and meet the POLICE and the TWO MEN . p. 52 POLICE These men are from the Asylum . They want to search the house . SEXTON Oh , they do ? Well , the whole town 's already searched it , and knocked it to pieces . There 's no one hiding in the house . ( To the MEN ) If you want the lunatic , I think you 'll find him in the people of Angels Aghast , and in yourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the owner of the house , we 've come to ask permission to search it , although we have the necessary authority to proceed without permission . SEXTON I am not the owner of the house ! I 'm the sexton of the First Presbyterian Church of Angels Aghast , as I 've been thirty years ! The description of Sam Ego you gave the paper last night rang the bell in the belfry at six this morning , and had me assaulted by twenty small boys who if they did n't kill me , tried their best . You 've had Sam Ego twenty-five years . Must you have him longer still , if he 's not dead somewhere ? MAN He 's a patient and needs proper care . SEXTON And if he does n't want your care , as he 's clearly indicated , I suppose he 's got to have it , anyway ! MAN He may be dangerous  --  to himself if not to others . He 's not balanced . p. 53 SEXTON ( Furious ) Where the hell have you been except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of somebody somewhere in the world who is balanced ? Yourself , perhaps ? The HOUSE-MOVERS come around the house to see what all the shouting 's about . OTHER MAN ( To PASTOR ) Who is this man ? Who is responsible for him ? PASTOR ( Swiftly , scared to death of the long arm of the local Lunacy Board taking away his old friend ) I am responsible for him . SEXTON ( Blowing up ) Nobody 's responsible for me ! Do you take me for a child ? You 've both been Boy Scouts , I 'm sure ! PASTOR ( Swiftly ) He 's had a wretched ordeal ! He 's all right ! I 'm responsible for him ! He 's served me well for thirty years ! SEXTON I do n't need to be protected from these blithering idiots from the Lunatic Asylum ! MAN ( Nodding knowingly to the POLICE , then speaking to the SEXTON ) I want to ask you a few simple questions . PASTOR ( Taking the SEXTON by the arm and trying to go off with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He 's quite all right ! p. 54 MAN ( Stopping the PASTOR , who is now absolutely terrified , while the SEXTON is ready to fight ) It will be necessary . ( He nods to the OFFICER , who gets ready for trouble . The MAN looks up into the sky as he speaks ) Now , then . What is your name ? SEXTON ( Clenching his fist ) This is what my name is ! He swings at the MAN , catches him on the side of the head , knocks him down , and takes to his heels with the POLICE running after him , the PASTOR hanging onto the coattails of the POLICE with all his might . PASTOR He 's all right , gentlemen ! I 'm responsible ! He 's had an ordeal ! The POLICE blows his whistle . UTMOST and EASY quietly paint on the wall of the house , the HOUSE-MOVER stands over the MAN knocked down , while his BROTHER wrestles with the OTHER MAN from the Asylum . HOUSE-MOVER ( To the felled MAN ) My brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men teased . BROTHER ( Putting his MAN down while the HOUSE-MOVER helps his MAN up ) @x UTMOST and EASY URGE are on the roof of SAM EGO 'S house , which is now on an unimportant and empty side street in the heart of Angels Aghast , looking toward Sundown Slums . The roof is shingled and steep , but there is a flat area in front of a rather large attic window and it is from here that the URGES climb onto the roof and work . A good many old shingles have been removed from the roof and are lying on the attic porch , and a few bad spots in the roof have already been patched with new shingles . UTMOST is lying on the roof putting nails into the last shingle of a small patch of new shingles . EASY is standing on the attic porch , helping him . Only the heads of the ANGELS are visible over the top of the roof . It is a peaceful , summer morning with a deep blue sky . Only a handful of lazy , indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except for the roof and the sky , little else is open to view , although very far away the land and streets and houses of Sundown Slums are visible . The city itself , however , is felt to be all around , and near . The occasional bark of an automobile horn is heard . UTMOST finishes his work , hands EASY the hammer he has been using , slides down onto the porch and studies the work he 's done . URGE Well , it is n't much , but it 's finished , so if you 're as hungry as I am , and if you like the idea  --  bring up the lunch and we 'll have it here on the roof . p. 56 URGE I 'm hungry all right . ( He slips through the open attic window to the attic . ) URGE And of course ask Mr. Ego to join us.EASY disappears , and UTMOST refreshes himself , stretching and yawning slowly and easily . He tidies up the attic porch a bit , scuffling old shingles into a pile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up lengthwise for a chair . EASY and SAM EGO appear in the attic , and EASY slips up through the window and onto the porch with the lunchbox , while SAM EGO smiles and waves to UTMOST . There is little uncontrollable shaking in SAM EGO now , and he seems untroubled and at ease . He is wearing a suit of UTMOST 'S clothes . EGO I 'm just as starved as I can be , and I need the air and light ! There 's a sky to remember a minute or two ! Are you sure it 's all right for me to appear on the roof ? URGE ( Helping him through the window and onto the porch ) Of course it 's all right . In any case , if you 'll sit here , you 'll not be seen . But if you are , that will not change a thing . You 're free . EGO ( Sitting on the box ) I am free , is n't that the truth ? If you could only know the free sleep I sleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you bought my house , sir.The lunchbox has been passed around and they ALL have sandwiches . p. 57 URGE I scarcely bought the house . I accepted it as a gift , for the auctioneer and the administrator of the estate wanted it off the land and away . EGO A wicked , haunted house that no one wanted to buy , the house I built so long ago ! But even at that , you might have thought twice before buying it or accepting it as a gift , as you say . The house is loathed by everyone , in which I put the fairest hopes of living . You might have thought twice . Why did n't you ? URGE I wanted the house . A great deal can be done with any house , let alone a house so well-made , if anybody wants to bother , and as I 'll never see the house I dreamed I 'd one day have  --  well , here I am with another dream and this house . Still , dreams go on , fitting themselves to whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to make the dreamer lose his sleep . Here 's house enough for my rest and sleep , and new design and repair to my old dream . Dying fills me with the only hate I know , so I like to start things out again , which is in the line of my business , dealing as I do in things that others feel are finished . Among the junk of the yard I run in Sundown Slums , I 've had the time it takes to learn that nothing ends . People or things neither die nor finish but change and reach another order of being , and as I find great beauty in change , my work , though full of what appears to be debris , to me is full of beauty and surprise . p. 58 EGO Is n't that the truth ? Is n't that the truth , right here next the sky , free and at peace , eating our lunches ? URGE Old and new are bound together and part of the same thing , which is change , and why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fall to pieces , or steal away . The broken jug of clay is not death ; it is the child 's shovel or the world he must mend and manage . ( He places his hand on his son 's head ) The weight of this Easy head balances heaven and earth . ( He looks out at the sky ) You see what a sky does to a man who hates dying . Still , I say there 's no such thing . EGO Ah , you speak to heal me , and your healing lets me speak . Is n't that the truth ? You bought this house to give me back my own , I know . What luck to be here with you on the attic porch of my own house , free , easy , and a closer neighbor to the sky than I have ever been . These eight or nine days that we 've been in this one place have been the freest days of my life . Is it any wonder that I almost wish the journey would never end ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget . URGE We 've been here nine days if we 've come to Tuesday , as I believe we have . ( To EASY ) What are the facts , my son ? URGE The day is Tuesday the 14th , the month August , the year 1945 , and it is seven minutes before noon . p. 59 EGO Is n't that the truth ? Go on , my boy . URGE The house has been here , in the middle of Merry Angel Street , near the Center of Angels Aghast , several hours more than nine days . The house-movers abandoned the horses at that time and hired a tractor , which also failed to move the house . They then discovered that their rollers had sunk into the tar of the street , made soft by the hottest summer since 1919 . They also discovered certain flaws in the system they had devised , and went to work correcting the flaws . ( Pause . ) EGO Yes , my boy . Please go on . URGE Well , the Angels ' Herald has published daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding that the house be destroyed as a public nuisance , a cartoon showing the house blocking traffic , and the opinions of three dozen leading citizens , all in favor of destroying the house , except one . EGO And who was that ? URGE Judge Zodiac . EGO Now , is n't that just like a man I always thought was a charlatan to be the only man in town who 's not ? Is n't that the truth ? And how will it all end , I wonder ? URGE The matter is being considered by the city government , and it 's the main topic of conversation throughout the city . The Angels ' Herald has charged that Utmost Urge is hiding Sam Ego either in his home in Sundown Slums or in the Eagle 's Nest itself , or knows where Sam Ego is . ( Sudden noise ) And I think something 's happened ! ( The whistles of the city begin to scream one by one ) I think the War 's over ! ( He looks at his father and at SAM EGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 60 URGE I believed it would be one day . Well , that 's fine.UTMOST helps SAM EGO to the edge of the porch where UTMOST points to the celebrating people . The TWO MEN and EASY stand in silence and listen to the shouting of the people : " The War 's over , the War 's over ! " They are excited but unable to do anything but watch and listen . Steam whistles and automobile horns of all kinds and in all kinds of musical patterns cover up for the celebrating people their hysteria , or impel them into it deeper . The piping of a steam calliope weaves in and out of the high-pitched uproar , busy with popular songs and old favorites . MEMBERS OF A BAND appear to gather spontaneously , and begin marching through Angels Aghast , playing marches and dances . The band sounds as if it has about three big drums and three big horns too many . Every now and then a pistol or rifle shot is heard , and occasionally someone fires three shots in quick succession . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hum and buzz and cry of the whole sorrowful hullabaloo weaves itself together into something with the quality of an elegy or funeral march trying very hard to be a sentimental waltz.DANCEY URGE , a girl of fourteen or so who has been running swiftly for a long distance , appears at the attic window , climbs out , throws herself into her father 's arms , and helplessly stares with inexpressible joy at him , and SAM EGO , and EASY . URGE ( Shouting ) My daughter Dancey . ( To the GIRL ) Darling , this is Mr. Ego . ( DANCEY just barely curtsies , and SAM EGO makes a deep bow . UTMOST shouts to everybody ) No use trying to talk ! p. 61 EGO ( Shouting ) Is n't that the truth ? I 'll go to my room and lie down now ! I 'm glad the war 's over ! EASY slips through the window to the attic , his father helps SAM EGO through , and EASY helps from the other side . SAM EGO bows to DANCEY , nods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EASY soon reappears at the window and slips out . He goes to the edge of the porch to watch the people some more . UTMOST climbs onto the roof to return to work , while EASY and DANCEY stare down at the celebrators . When EASY hears his father hammering on the roof , he goes to help him , and after a moment or two DANCEY begins to dance to the music of the elegy . p. 62 Act 3 , Scene 2 Scene II The HOUSE-MOVER and his BROTHER are under a forward edge of SAM EGO 'S house during the End-of-War revelries of the people in Merry Angel Street . Where they are is seen as if the eye were a yard or two behind them , and what the HOUSE-MOVERS see is all that is open to view . They see the lower half of what appears to be hundreds of people , and what they hear is not the elegy-waltz that SAM EGO and UTMOST and EASY heard , and DANCEY danced to . The HOUSE-MOVERS hear feet . They also hear voices of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds . They also hear music , but it is not at all like the music that was heard from the roof . They are too close to the celebration to hear it well . They are sitting on what appears to be tar-paving , almost facing each other , but looking out to the street and the swarming half-bodies there . They are BOTH calm , and surely alive in the life of the mind . The ANGELS sit nearby and listen . HOUSE-MOVER Well , the War 's over , and the money 's all gone . ( He turns his wallet upside down . ) BROTHER And it 's still three miles to Sundown Slums ! ( He holds out three fingers . ) HOUSE-MOVER It 's these interruptions slowing us down all the time . p. 63 BROTHER First , the Boy Scouts , and now the End of the War . HOUSE-MOVER I 'd get married if I could find a girl who could cook , sew , sing , and carry on a decent conversation . BROTHER I do n't believe I heard you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over I 'd get married if I could find a girl who could cook , sew , sing , play the piano , carry on a decent conversation , and have children . BROTHER Cook , sew , sing and what ? HOUSE-MOVER ( Shouting ) Have children ! Have children ! BROTHER Yes . I 'd like a good wife myself . HOUSE-MOVER A pretty girl who knew her way about in a kitchen . BROTHER I 'd like her to bake bread . HOUSE-MOVER Nothing nicer-smelling than fresh home-made bread . BROTHER Yes . I 'd like a girl like that very much . HOUSE-MOVER Have n't smelled fresh bread since the War began . BROTHER And here it is all over with . HOUSE-MOVER We might have moved the house a little this afternoon except for all the people in the way . p. 64 BROTHER I never thought the War would end this afternoon . HOUSE-MOVER It did , though . BROTHER For awhile there I thought it was never going to end . HOUSE-MOVER Next thing you know , some afternoon we 'll be moving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to crawl under the house to get out of the way of the excited people . HOUSE-MOVER It started out to be a nice afternoon , but now I 'm half-ashamed of being a human being.They sit in silence a moment , listening to the noise and watching the half-bodies . A heavy YOUNG WOMAN in loose clothing sticks her head into the line of vision , to look under the house . YOUNG WOMAN Yippee ! The War 's over ! ( She gets down on her hands and knees ) Come on , girls , let 's crawl under old Sam Ego 's house ! The HOUSE-MOVERS look around in alarm . A half-dozen GIRLS and WOMEN of assorted sizes , all in summer dresses , all hysterical , get on their hands and knees and crawl under the house , headed straight for the HOUSE-MOVERS . The GIRLS scream and giggle as they charge . " Yahoo ! Wahoo ! Whoopee ! Wow ! The War 's over ! We won the War ! Oh , Nagasaki ! " And so on . The HOUSE-MOVERS squirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover or concealment , but the wild WOMEN are too fast for them , and the MEN are leaped upon , hugged , kissed , tickled , goosed , and generally driven far afield from the life of the mind . p. 65 WOMAN WITH HEADLOCK ON HOUSE-MOVER Oh , Hiroshima ! WOMAN PIGGY-BACK ON HOUSE-MOVER 'S BROTHER Oh , Nagasaki ! p. 66 Act 3 , Scene 3 Scene III It is almost three months later , a pleasant afternoon in late October , and for some time now SAM EGO 'S house has been on Poor Angel Street in Sundown Slums , restored and repaired inside and out , the home of UTMOST URGE and his family , and their permanent guest , SAM EGO . A triangular edge of the front porch , including steps and front door , is out into the line of vision , overlooking the URGE place of business , which is a spacious yard containing junk of all kinds so neatly arranged as to make a pleasant picture . Included among the junk are old-fashioned wood-burning stoves , framed circles and squares of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , copper kettles highly polished , kerosene lamps , dinnerware , silverware , jugs , bottles , beds , tables , chairs , pipes , faucets , washbasins , bathtubs , books , framed pictures , and all sorts of other objects . The ANGELS are not in sight . The porch and yard have been hung with decorations , to mark the home-coming of the three URGE boys , who are of course the Angels . DANCEY is sweeping the steps and dancing to the music of an old record on an old phonograph which EASY is winding . The phonograph has an enormous horn painted red . UTMOST and SAM EGO are standing in the yard , looking toward the street . MRS . URGE steps out onto the front porch , waves to her husband and SAM EGO that all is ready , and goes back into the house , leaving the front door open . The HOUSE-MOVERS come along , each with a WOMAN on his arm , selected from among the assortment which fell upon them under SAM EGO 'S house the afternoon the War ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 67 EGO Yes , and thank you both for coming . BROTHER Is anything the matter with the way we put the house in place , Mr. Urge ? URGE There it is , as it 's been for almost two months now . It looks to me as if it 's quite at home . HOUSE-MOVER It certainly looks the way it ought to look , Mr. Ego . BROTHER It always was a handsome house , Mr. Urge . Oh , excuse me . This is my wife . HOUSE-MOVER We both got married the day after we finished moving this house . ( UTMOST and MR . EGO smile and nod to the WOMEN ) The only thing we 've moved since that time , though , has been a small barn that was no problem at all . BROTHER We did it for nothing for my wife 's father . EGO I sent for you because until yesterday I was not in a position to thank you for your work as I had hoped to do . HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE We read all about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been an awful experience to be hunted down that way , and taken back that way , and examined by all those people that way , and asked all those silly questions that way ! ( HOUSE-MOVER stares at her with anger ) Well , I would n't like to be treated that way , teased and tormented the way they did to Mr. Ego , to keep him from getting back his own rights and belongings ! I would n't like it one bit ! p. 68 EGO Thank you very much for  --  OTHER WIFE They had their nerve trying to pull a dirty trick like that on you , Mr. Ego . ( BROTHER stares at her with amazement and despair ) A lot of tin-horn crooks and politicians trying to make a fool out of a man whose shoestrings they do n't deserve to tie , so they can put him out of the way and grab his fortune for themselves . EGO Thank you both for your kind sympathy . HOUSE-MOVER And shut up for a minute ! HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! HOUSE-MOVER Stop it , will you ? OTHER WIFE And healthy and wealthy ! BROTHER Stop it , now ! The TWO WOMEN look at one another with outraged pride , then at SAM EGO , who nods with understanding and sympathy , permitting them to feel that they have not talked out of turn and are just as nice and pretty and intelligent as ever , in spite of the rudeness of their husbands . URGE And very soon my three sons are coming home , and we want you to stay to dinner and help us welcome them . HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE Oh , how nice ! Where have they been ? p. 69 URGE One 's been in the Navy , in the Atlantic and in the Pacific . One 's been in the Army , first in Greenland , then in Africa , and finally in Europe . And one 's been in the Marine Corps , first in Australia , then in the Philippines , and finally in China and Japan . OTHER WIFE Oh , they 've been everywhere , and now they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIFE Home from the War to peaceful Sundown Slums ! OTHER WIFE How proud you 'll feel , Mr. Urge , when you see them in their uniforms marching up Poor Angel Street to the door of their handsome home ! HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE How proud Mrs. Urge must feel of her hero sons who volunteered to fight for our civilization and save our way of life ! URGE I 'm sure she 's going to be glad to see them after so long , but they did n't volunteer . They were drafted . OTHER WIFE ( Let down a little ) Oh . ( Pause ) Well , anyway , how proud we all are of our brave boys ! URGE Oh , I suppose they 've been brave enough in many ways . They were certainly brave enough to try to get deferments from their Draft Board , but of course the deferments were n't granted . p. 70 HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE How wonderful to have them home again at last , safe and sound anyway ! URGE Yes , it will be wonderful , though they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe they 've all been to the hospital many times . OTHER WIFE Weary and wounded and sick of battle ! URGE No , I believe the boy in the Navy got drunk and fell out of a taxi in Liverpool and broke his leg . The boy in the Marines was cut up in a fight in a saloon in Manila , and the boy in the Army had a nervous breakdown in Paris . HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE ( Almost disgusted ) A nervous breakdown ? OTHER WIFE ( Trying to be helpful ) Battle fatigue , the Army calls it . URGE No , I do n't believe it was that . My boy was a clerk in the Army . He sat at a desk all through the War . BOTH WIVES Oh . URGE And of course they 've had their share of the common illnesses that plague us all , but Mrs. Urge and their younger brother and sister are going to be glad to see them , and so am I. If you 'd like to join Mrs. Urge in the house while your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll be delighted.BOTH MEN eagerly disengage themselves from their WIVES , who go off in silence into the house , just as EASY puts another record on the phonograph . From the sound of it the record on the phonograph . From the sound of it the record is as old as the phonograph . SAM EGO hands each of the HOUSE-MOVERS a sealed envelope , which they put in their pockets , and the FOUR MEN stroll about the yard , looking at the handsome junk . After a moment EASY stops the phonograph , takes off the record , examines what is written on its label , and puts it back on the stack of old records . p. 71 SEXTON ( Comes into the yard . Almost shouting ) I 've come this Sabbath afternoon for two reasons . To shake the hand of Sam Ego , and to buy a pole for the Pastor  --  a flagpole of course  --  to replace the one that was broken by the Boy Scouts . ( He takes SAM EGO 'S hand ) Sam , it 's good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when this house stopped beside the church I serve as sexton . EGO ( Delighted , trying to make out who the SEXTON is ) Please do n't tell me ! I remember , only it 's been so long . SEXTON Yes , it has been a long time , Sam . EGO Ah , of course , of course ! Al Fable ! I knew you the moment I saw you ! For a time we were thrown together quite a bit at school . I 'm delighted to see you , Al . You know Mr. Urge . SEXTON ( He smiles and nods to UTMOST ) Of course I know him . EGO Well , we 're waiting for three boys who 'll soon be coming home after an absence of almost half a dozen years . Stay and help us welcome them . Have you met the house-movers ? SEXTON ( Waving to the HOUSE-MOVERS ) Know them well ! They saved my life one day . ( Almost shouting ) Have you found the wives you told me you hoped to find ? p. 72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROTHER ( He looks as disgusted as he can be ) They 're both in there . SEXTON Now , about the pole for the Parson , Mr. Urge . Do you have a pole ? URGE ( To EASY ) Do we have a pole put away somewhere for Mr. Fable to take to the Parson ? URGE I do n't think so . I think we sold the last pole we had to that new group that calls itself Patriots First , Last and Always , Incorporated , but I 'll look around . ( He goes off to examine what 's in the yard . ) SEXTON Imbeciles First , Last and Always is what they are ! They 're always the first to put a flag on a pole and threaten everybody with it . URGE They asked me to join their club and give them the pole for nothing . They said it would be unpatriotic to make them pay seventy-five cents for the pole , but I made them pay for it just the same . ( Pause ) No , we have n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , appear and stand nearby , watching . SEXTON Well , no matter . ( He suddenly discovers the house ) Sam , I saw that house built at the turn of this fierce and fateful century , but it never looked as real and right as it looks this minute . I must confess I never believed it was worth fooling with , but there it is , looking as neat and sharp as a brand-new apple on a tree you never thought would have anything but worms , and here I am glad to my boots to have been so mistaken . ( To UTMOST ) Now , how the devil did you do it ? You did n't call in the Boy Scouts , did you ? Lord help us when they 're called in . I 'm stunned by the beauty of it . ( A small WESTERN UNION MESSENGER arrives by bicycle in the yard and hops off . The SEXTON leaps for cover ) Good God , is that a Boy Scout ? p. 73 URGE No , that 's a messenger . MESSENGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys . It says , Ought to be home around four but do n't make a fuss . Signed , Inner , Outer and Ample . But I see you 're all set to make a fuss . Want the telegram as a souvenir , Mr. Urge ? ( He hands the sealed telegram to UTMOST and walks to EASY ) Have you got a good pair of handlebars for my bike , Easy ? The THREE YOUNG MEN stroll into the yard easily , just barely exchanging greetings with EVERYBODY , as people do who do n't know one another but are n't required to introduce themselves . FIRST YOUNG MAN I 'd like a nice comfortable chair if you 've got one . URGE Well , we 've got several kinds of chairs that are comfortable . Have a look at them and maybe you 'll find one you like . SECOND YOUNG MAN Is it all right if I look around for a nice old-fashioned bed ? URGE Go ahead . You 'll find the beds over there . THIRD YOUNG MAN I have n't decided what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , I 'll just wander around awhile . MRS . URGE ( On the porch ) Where are they , for Heaven 's sake ? URGE Toby just brought a telegram saying they ought to be here around four but not to make a fuss . It 's half-past four now . p. 74 MRS . URGE Well , let 's not make a fuss , then . I 'm going to sit here on the porch and rock . ( She takes the rocker and rocks . ) FIRST YOUNG MAN ( Sitting in a chair ) Now this is a good chair . I think I like this chair , but I 'll just sit in it awhile and make sure . SECOND YOUNG MAN ( Stretching out on the wire spring of an old-fashioned bed ) I think I 'm going to like this bed . THIRD YOUNG MAN Damned if I know what I 'm going to like . ( He wanders around , picking things up and putting them down . ) SAM EGO sets a chair down beside the FIRST YOUNG MAN 'S chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A steam calliope is heard as it moves along a nearby street . The WIVES of the HOUSE-MOVERS come tearing out of the house onto the porch . HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE Is it them ? OTHER WIFE Of course it is ! The TWO WOMEN run off toward the music . The HOUSE-MOVERS take long strides in the hope of catching up with their WIVES and stopping them from making fools of themselves . The SEXTON wanders around the yard with the THIRD YOUNG MAN , looking at the junk with him . UTMOST stands over the YOUNG MAN lying on the bed and looks at him a long time . p. 75 URGE I 'm afraid you 'll have to tell me which one you are . URGE ( Showing MESSENGER a pair of handlebars ) He 's Ample . URGE Well , that 's fine . MRS . URGE comes down the steps with DANCEY skipping after her , and they wander around the yard , looking at the THREE YOUNG MEN as they go . EGO ( To the FIRST YOUNG MAN ) If you 're wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what he 's doing here , he 's something like a friend of the family or a distant relative , and he 's boarding here . URGE ( To the FIRST YOUNG MAN ) You 're Outer , I know , although you 've changed a lot . Well , that 's fine . SEXTON ( To the THIRD YOUNG MAN ) Now , a book might be what you 're looking for . How about this one for size ? ( He hands the YOUNG MAN what appears to be the telephone directory of a large city . ) THIRD YOUNG MAN ( Opening the directory ) It 's a little big , but I think it 's just the thing I am looking for . URGE ( To MRS . URGE ) Well , it certainly is a beautiful day . I think I 'd like to sit down and eat a lot of roast beef , and then a lot of apple pie , and then drink a lot of coffee . p. 76 MRS . URGE Well , the roast beef 's ready , the pies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You let me know , and I 'll fix your place at the table . SECOND YOUNG MAN ( Sitting up on the bed ) I think I 'd like a place , too , if it 's all right . ( To the FIRST YOUNG MAN ) How about you ? FIRST YOUNG MAN I 'm hungry all right , and I 'd certainly like to see the inside of that fine house . ( To the THIRD YOUNG MAN ) You feel like a little food with these nice people , you with the book over there ? THIRD YOUNG MAN Yes , I believe I do . URGE Well , no hurry , but I think I 'll go in and sit down . ( To EASY and MESSENGER ) You coming , boys ? MESSENGER Thanks a lot , Mr. Urge . I 'll sit down a minute , but I 've already had my Sunday dinner.EASY and MESSENGER follow UTMOST into the house . FIRST YOUNG MAN ( Getting up and taking SAM EGO by the arm ) Well , no use putting off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . THIRD YOUNG MAN ( Taking the SEXTON by the arm ) I 'm just as hungry as I can be , and I hope you are , too.They go into the house . The SECOND YOUNG MAN gets off the bed and yawns long and easily as he looks the whole place over . While he 's yawning the music of the calliope fades away , and the HOUSE-MOVERS come back with their WIVES on their arms . p. 77 SECOND YOUNG MAN They 've gone inside to have Sunday dinner . HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE Are n't they going to wait till the heroes get home ? The HOUSE-MOVER gives her a sad look and just barely shakes his head with despair . OTHER WIFE I never heard of such a thing ! Three heroes coming home after years of fighting , and nobody wants to give them a decent welcome ! MRS . URGE ( On the porch ) Dinner 's on the table , everybody ! Wo n't you please come in ? HOUSE-MOVER 'S WIFE Are n't you going to wait till the heroes get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
