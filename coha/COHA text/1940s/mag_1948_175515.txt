( See Cover ) <P> Down from the rocky ridges and snow-choked gullies the guerrillas straggled last week . Some were barefoot , some wore slabs of leather tied about their feet with string . Two Greek government forces , catching the rebels in a pincers northwest of Mt . Olympus , had driven them up the slopes of Mt . Pieria , up beyond the snow line . There the guerrillas ' food gave out . Some ate their mules . By week 's end , after a month of fighting , over 800 had been captured or had surrendered . They left the corpses of about 800 more behind them on the heights . <P> The Contagion of Hope . The Greek army 's rout of these guerrillas , many of them untrained , ill-armed recruits for Communist Markos Vafiades ' army , was one of the few positive achievements that could be claimed for the Truman Doctrine after a full year . The battle of Mt . Pieria was neither great nor glorious . It was , however , important : for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to " contain " the guerrillas , had taken the offensive . Just as the U.S. had finally begun to crowd the Communists with political moves like the Trieste trump in Italy and General Lucius Clay 's tough stand in Germany , so the Greek army was no longer Content to sit back and wait for the next Communist threat . <P> The various anti-Communist moves throughout Europe were not part of a definite plan ; but they had a connection . Testifying last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee , Secretary of Defense James Forrestal had said : " The disease of despair is contagious , but there is a greater contagion in hope . " <P> The mass of the people in Europe and Asia wanted to be let alone . They did not want to fight for or against the Reds . The mass of the U.S. people did not want to fight , either . There was a strong tendency in the U.S. to wait for the Greeks , the Italians , the French and the Chinese to do it , and an equally strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both would be lost . <P> <P> The Big Ones . Since Truman had proclaimed the U.S. policy of defending Greece , most Greeks had asked themselves : Why not sit back and let the U.S. and Russia fight it out ? One young conscript , an Athenian grocer 's son , put it this way : " Why does America help us at all ? They have it all worked out , the big ones . We are just holding the position for them until they are ready . " <P> A TIME correspondent asked a Greek lieutenant , who had fought with exceptional bravery against the Italians and Germans , what had happened to the spirit of seven years ago . The lieutenant shrugged : " This war in Greece is a battle between the United States and Russia . It happens that it 's being fought here . That is our bad luck . But you ca n't expect us to fight your battle singlehanded-at least not with the old spirit . " <P> Reluctant Hunters . On the other hand , Americans , seeing more &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks did n't buckle down to the job and wipe out the Communist guerrillas . U.S. advisers have urged the Greek-army , scattered among its fortified positions , to get out on the offensive . Greek generals replied that they were not well enough armed .
