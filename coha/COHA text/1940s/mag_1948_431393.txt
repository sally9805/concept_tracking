 | Along with the day 's letters , bills , and magazines came a long , strikingly printed envelope from , shall we say , giving it a fictitious name , the Utopia Accident and Health Association , Inc. , Jesse James , president . If the letterhead had carried a company motto , it should have been : " Heads we win , tails you lose . " I had been expecting to hear from the Utopia . I had deliberately asked to . But it was still strange to hold in my hand concrete evidence that Uncle Sam is unwilling accessory to some of the most cruel swindling schemes ever invented . Phony mail-order insurance , promising but cynically failing to provide protection against financial hardships arising from accident , illness , and hospital bills , is a racket that no decent citizen or institution would care to abet Nobody with any moral sense could countenance exploitation of Mom 's worry about what would happen if Pop were laid up for a couple of months . Yet dail the United States mails carry hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in these . racketeers ' immoral and predatory interests Uncle Sam does not like being messenger boy for such doings . But so far he has been unable effectively to quit the job . Already knowing the score , I wrote simplesounding letters inviting the Utopia and some of its competitors to capture another victim . But it is quite another matter for low- or moderate-income families who fall in earnest for the fly-bynighters ' ingenious come-ons . CA family of five , for example , might pay the Utopia $42 a year for " protection " that will not protect . That money would have bought shoes for the whole family . And for all practical purposes , those bills might just as well have been snipped into little bits and thrown away . The worst is that probably at least $30 of those $42 go to buy luxuries for the people who run these rackets . Such an " insured " family may pay for years without occasion to find out they are being fooled . Now and again , it is true , the Utopia pays a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled checks and thank-you letters in its advertising . But chances are pretty small that trying to collect would mean much more than tragic disappointment The exploited family may have been on a mailing list the Utopia bought from a broker . Or , seeing the firm 's mellifluous advertising in an incautious newspaper or magazine , the father may have written , asking for trouble , as I did . The advertising sounds enticing : " No Physical Examination Necessary . . . Nobody Will Call . . . We give such values because we have no expenses for agents ' commissions and branch offices . . . "  | You can get just as gypped , however , by fly-bynight companies that send " bushbeaters , " as their fast-talking agents are called , into your neighborhood . But agents cost money , and the mail-order - ticket is a richer gold mine ? for the racketeer . I have been studying expert analyses of these heads-we-win policies , comparing advertising promises with what the policies actually offer . The fancy leaflet , with the picture of a wise old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utopia , says that this insurance is " comprehensive " and " pays liberal benefits . " That is a bald-faced lie , experts say . The actual policy is " extremely restricted " and ? extensively limited . " As required by the insurance regulations of the state from which it operates , the Utopia actually has overprinted the face of its policy in large letters : " This is a limited policy ? Read it care- fully . " But the smart fellows know there is little risk in this warning . The four pages of thick paper contain 4,500 words of the dullest reading in the world . Few persons would bother to hunt through its weasel phraseology for the tricks with which it is liberally sprinkled , or try to grasp the significance of all the things it leaves out ... Knowing the answers , however , makes the policy interesting reading . The leaflet promises " a large accidental-death " benefit " up to $2,000 . " The policy does , too but only if the insured is accidentally killed while riding as fare-paying passenger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle is wrecked in the process of killing him and he was actually inside it , or if he is accidentally poisoned by doctor , dentist , or nurse during an operation ; or if he is kicked by a horse or gored by a bull , or meets death in a few other such relatively rare ways . @#  | But if he is killed in any of the more frequent ways ? falls downstairs , gets run over , is in an automobile accident ? the Utopia owes the family only $200 instead of that impressive $2,000 adver-tised The family is n't too likely to get even that . Another joker buried in the verbiage cuts death benefits in half if the deceased is under 18 . A third pretty well cuts the ground out from under the whole proposition by stating that not a cent will be paid if " contributory negligence " of the victim can be shown . One of my experts regarded that clause with both incredulity and awe . " That one is hard to believe even when you look straight at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what most people want insurance against . " JOKERS are just as prevalent in the sickness-benefit part of the policy . The leaflet promises " up to $25 a week " for illness causing continuous houseconfinement under medical care . But wait ? that applies to only certain illnesses . Gravely the policy lists them , 53 of them , a solid mass of alarming words that would give anybody ? except a doctor ? the impression that it includes most of the ills that flesh is heir to , Here they are : " Pneumonia ( lobar ) , Cancer , Goiter ( when operated upon ) , Diabetes , Typhoid Fever ( by Widal test only ) , Scarlet Fever , Lichen Planus , Hives , Small Pox , Diphtheria , Spinal Meningitis , Sty , Erysipelas , Angina Pectoris , Acute Cerebral Meningitis , Abscess of Brain ( when operated upon ) , Varioloid , Mumps , Trichinosis , Tape Worm , Measles , Chicken Pox , Typhus Fever , Whooping Cough , Epilepsy , Chorea ( St. Vitus ' Dance ) , Vaccina Fever , Yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barber 's Itch , Lockjaw ( Tetanus ) , Hydrophobia , Ivy Poisoning , Acute Yellow Atrophy of Liver , Acute Lead Poisoning , Malignant Pustule ( Anthrax ) , Mushroom Poisoning , Hemophilia , Phlebitis , Charcot 's Joint Disease , Leprosy , Malta Fever , Trachoma , Noma , Psoriasis , Rubella , Varicella , Felon , Oak Poisoning , Encephalitis ( Sleeping Sickness ) , Paralysis Agitans ( Palsy ) , Embolism or Osteomalacia . " , CC What a money 's worth ! ' However , of the 53 , at least 6 , such as barber 's itch , are trifling complaints , which seldom confine a victim under medical care Another 6 are childhood diseases rare among adults , and a joker on page 4 of the policy says it " shall not cover any person under the age of 15 years . " At least 12 are infrequent to extremely rare in the United States-your chances of getting yellow fever are about the same as your neighbor 's of having sextuplets , all boys . And hundreds of diseases , including many that frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For them , instead of the promised $25 a week , you get a maximum of $15 , prorated through the first month .  | If you are lucky , that is . For the application you signed to get your policy has another joker , something like : " I certify I am not now suffering under any illness or disability . " Suppose your doctor finds you have diabetes and sends you to bed for a while , to get a good start on treatment , , and you claim your insurance . The company replies that you probably had incipient diabetes when you signed up . Thus obtained under false pretenses , the policy is void . If you break an ankle and try to collect accident indemnity , the company 's investigation reveals that you sometimes have dizzy spells , not mentioned on your application , and undoubtedly a dizzy spell caused your accident . Again n s indemnity . The neatest cynicism is to include hemophilia ? a hereditary disease passed through mothers but appearing only in males . It is very rare . The hemophiliac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including mother and daughters , is insured against an ailment impossible for women to have and inadmissible under the terms of the application . THE victimized policyholder can always sue . But the company knows that chances are very high he wo n't , because the **25;608;TOOLONG suit is obviously not worth while . For larger benefits , the victim finds he can not sue the company in his own state courts The Utopia is incorporated in a state many miles away , is not under jurisdiction of the victim 's state ; and federal courts have no jurisdiction The expense involved in a suit in another state and the poor chance of collecting ? after all , the company has followed the black-and-white terms of the policy ? are too discouraging No tricks are missed . The policies are usually cleverly drawn by crack lawyers whose legal footwork is skilful . The latest scheme is to cash in c- . public over-anxiety about infant : paralysis ( poliomyelitis ) : " This letter : s really important . . . To Your Peace : f Mind . . . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expatiat.r dismally on the long-term , heavy . ipense of polio . So for $3 per person per year these protectors of your peace of mind will pay " up to $5,000 " if po : : o strikes ? provided the insured is over 18 and gets only one type of the disease . This is really cruel . Four out of S Americans who get this disease are children under 15 . On a 5-year average only 16,000 Americans annually hart it in recognizable form . So the chances that a person over 18 will get it are only 1 in 43,750 . This policy takes your money at odds of 1 to 1,750 . Just SO a sporting proposition , your $3 should pay $131,250 instead of a mere $5.0:M Due to record-keeping and mailing overhead , no insurance company could pay that , of course . But these policies are fantastically out of line . Legitimate companies now try ' polio insurance , to acquire actuarial es . perience in what a polio rider on theme regular policies should cost , offer 55.000 at a nominal $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom risk is relatively high . That is the pay-off on how greedily racketeers exploit publicity about such good causes as the March of Dimes . EVER since Blue Cross hospitalization became well known , racketeers have been cashing in on Blue Cross publicity and reputation . They imitate the symbol ? a blue , equal-armed , thick cross with a central circle showing the organization 's coat of arms and motto , Some imitators merely make it a white cross on a blue square , which is confusing enough . But in one case the cross was blue and carried a central circle with a sketch of a nurse 's head . At three feet this was indistinguishable from the genuine Blue Cross . Others borrow phraseology from the genuine Blue Cross organizations ? " Associated Hospital " and " hospitalization plan " frequently crop up in their advertising of hospital-charge features in accident and health policies ) Protest to an ethical company thus infringing Blue Cross ideas often brings apology and withdrawal . But the sharpshooters go right ahead , serenely aware that , so far , the genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reputation . The very words " Blue Cross " can be exploited . Recently a company with an excellent reputation for honest dealing ran the following newspaper advertisement about a medical-expense policy : " Blue Cross subscribers and all other hospitalization policyholders can now have a plan to pay their Doctor Bills at home ? in the hospital ? or doctor 's office for any sickness ? accident or operation . Will pay up to $500 for all medical expenses . " The words " Blue Cross " and " Doctor Bills " and the figure " $500 " were large , and the advertisement layout displayed them prominently . To repeat , this is an honest company . But the effect of this typography surely is an effort in dubious taste to exploit publicity on Blue Cross medicalcare plans . The Blue Cross actually has been sued for using its own symbol : A commercial insurance company in New England had borrowed the blue cross for selling hospitalization insurance well before the real Blue Cross started organizing in that territory . When the real Blue Cross appeared , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights to the symbol . Decision on the case is still pending . Some non-Blue Cross hospitalization policies are a sound money 's worth . But those sold by chiselers distinctly are not ; they are full of dodges like those in gyp accident and sickness insurance . The advertising says the insured can go to " any hospital " ; the policy limits this to hospitals accredited by the American Medical Association or the American Osteopathic Association . The ' advertising promises payment of costs of anesthesia and blood transfusion ; the policy says only " expenses of administration " of anesthesia and @#  | only " expenses of equipment " for blood transfusions . Promised " medical expenses " boil down to a few dollars applied on the surgeon 's fee . And so forth . And then the usual list of happy policyholders in widely scattered places . One investigator swore to me , with names , dates , and places , that some years ago he encountered a policy that required , as condition of payment , that the insured call in person at the company head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment unless the bereaved family had had the insured buried northeast to southwest with an apple in one hand , a lemon in the other . Those conditions were in very small type , of course . But small type to put over a fast one , once widely used , is not so important os you might think . Many states now require that policies issued by companies they license ? all companies are licensed somewhere ? be printed in sizable type ; some require that limitations and exceptions be in blacker or still larger type . Such rules are well enforced . But they do little good , because , , as mentioned before , the sheer dreariness of the wordage discourages careful reading . PUTTING chiselers out of business is the hope of many a competent state insurance commissioner and of the United States Post Office ; also of legitimate companies , because every gypped policyholder gives honest accident and health insurance an undeserved public black eye . One honest company even advertises : " You do n't have to be gored by a bull to collect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warnings , and legal leverages are few and weak . Blanket condemnation of mail-order insurance , for instance , is unfair . Numerous fine companies do business by mail and give an excellent money 's worth . Some get accreditation in all states in which they do business . Others do not bother , because that means added expense and trouble . So whether or not a mail-order outfit is licensed by your state proves little . Ifact , if you live in a state where tie insurance commission does a poor je you may be better off with an unlicensed , on-the-level , out-of-state cornpony . Quality of advertising can be mislead . ing , too . An irreproachable company seeking maximum business may run cheap-looking ads that resemble the chiselers ' ads . However , they mean what they say . A company 's mailing address can be significant . Quality of state insurance commissions and enforcement of regulotions vary from bad to excellent . New York State and Connecticut usually mean legitimate operation . Fly-bynighters tend to set up shop in certain states ? Delaware and Indiana seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that other Delaware and Indiana companies are not very much all right . Financial soundness proves nothing . Due to the very greediness of their methods , the fly-by-nighters are usually gloriously solvent . This should be made @#  | clear , not only because it is ironically true , but also because it is rightly a criminal offense to impugn the financial standing of an insurance company . The Utopia probably collects a million a year while paying out only $250,000 in claims . The difference goes in " expenses " ? meaning the legitimate running expenses of any insurance company and the fat pickings to the bosses . But this high solvency is a rule of thumb that works fairly well in judging a company . If the " loss ratio " ? the percentage of premium money that is paid to satisfy policyholders ? is too low , suspicion is justified . Anything under 40 percent paid out , one expert tells me , does n't look good , A letter to your state insurance commission may get you figures to judge by , if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a door-to-door proposition . UNCLE SAM 'S grotesque position as unwilling errand boy is due to the fact that control of insurance is a state , not a federal affair , and from the immense usefulness to the racketeers of the federal mail system , over which states have no control . Thus in the middle , racketeers can get licensed in , say , the state of Wyandotte ( posting $25,000 as guarantee will do it ) and then carefully refrain from activity in that state ? while deluging the rest of the nation with mailed advertisements . Ten million pieces of mail a year were the output of one company recently under investigation . A state insurance commissioner can do relatively little except look grimly at a company 's annual report , which probably says " no business done " in that state . Theoretically the Unite States Post Office Department has a weapon : it can prosecute for using the mails to defraud . But fraud is extremely hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt , and gyp insurance companies usually have smart lawyers The liveliest Post Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indictment being found by a federal grand jury , can stand as sam-ple : The indicted company claimed in its advertising that its low rates and high benefits were possible because mail-order methods permitted cutting out expensive agents ' commissions . Uncle Sam hopes to prove that the company was actually paying heavy commissions on premiums to one of the company officers . And top benefits , as advertised , were so high that Uncle Sam hopes to show also that " in truth and in fact , as the defendants well knew , said Accident Policy combined such limitations and restrictions that the said sum . . . could not be paid unless under a combination of numerous specified conditions and circumstances which would rarely , if ever , exist . " That case has yet to come to trial . In the past , when the fly-by-nighter has been unusually indiscreet , convictions have been obtained . Jail for four years was handed the boss of a prewar outfit that took in $75,000 and paid out only $4,000 in claims ? a loss ratio of slightly over 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one man about to be sentenced for the fraudulent doings of his company , from which he had received $372,000 ? $10,000 more than was paid in claims during the same period . But as long as Uncle Sam has only the cumbrous fraud laws to work with , legal victories probably will be infrequent . For thirteen years the House of Representatives ' Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads , spearheaded by Representative Sam Hobbs of Alabama , has been working on a bill to prohibit use of the mails to insurance companies that fail to comply with the regulations of the states into which they send mailings . That might not kill , but it probably would cripple the fly-bynighters . Yet , as the protests of many legitimate operators have shown during hearings on such bills , this would seriously damage many honest outfits and fraternal and professional insurance schemes . This year Representative William J. Miller of Connecticut , also on . the Committee , asked the numerous expert insurance lawyers in his state to help draw up a formula that would maim the gyps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistry , about as exacting as a scientist 's efforts to find a drug that will kill a certain kind of bacterium without ' harming either the patient or his beneficent bugs . But the Hartford experts assure Mr. Miller that a feasible bill may be formulated . If such a bill does develop , chances are high that it will pass and do a great deal of instant good . There is also a good chance that , as the year progresses , the Federal Trade Commission will acquire legal powers to exert itself in this field for the first time . qN addition to federal action , society has local and private ways of acting in its own behalf . The national organization of Better Business Bureaus , taking a livelier interest , plans investigation and ' publicity in the right quarters to make these insurance rackets more uncomfortable . And many a state could step up the size and powers of its insurance commission and borrow from New York the tactics of forbidding licensed companies to issue policies , within or without the state , that fail meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't pay money on any accident , health , disability , or hospitalization policy until you have read every word with a sharp eye for the kind of tricks described above . And o n't fall for any phony Blue Crosses . + ( ' When you notice something suspicious , write a protest , giving chapter and verse , to the Better Business Bureau in your largest near-by city , to the state insurance department at your state capital , and to the Post Qffice Department , Washington , D. C. Someday , let us hope , the gyp insurance companies will be unable to carry on their fraudulent business .
