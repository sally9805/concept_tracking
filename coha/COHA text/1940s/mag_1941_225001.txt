By the 13th Century , the place called itself " Sovereign Great Novgorod " and its Kremlin was already about as old as any structure in the U.S. is now . The Kremlin 's newer stone walls were begun in 1302 . Through the years the city accumulated hundreds of priceless relics , such as the great Twelfth Century bronze doors of the Cathedral of St. Sophia . <P> But Stukas have no reverence for relics .
