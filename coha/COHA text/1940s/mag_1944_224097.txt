Across the jagged Badlands , over the rolling plains of stubble wheat , and even in Watford City ( pop . 1,087 ) , there were still solid patches of snow . But the miracle had happened . Throughout North Dakota , the big thaw had come . The hard-bitten men who farm the northern tip of the onetime poverty-stricken U.S. " dust bowl " had survived a decade of dust , drought . WPA , grasshoppers , mortgages . Now , after a three-year spell of war and golden weather , they could afford a little fun in town . <P> At the City Bar 's wide wooden counter , MacKenzie County farmers , their jeans heavy with cash , drank up 40 cases of beer a day . At Christensen 's hardware store they stripped the shelves nearly bare . They played poker , guzzled , loafed , had Doc Winter put gold in their teeth . <P> During the ' 30s , North Dakota lost almost everything but its weathered denims and its prized " elbow room . " Last year the state came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spring and durum wheat production , first in barley , second in certified seed potatoes . North Dakota farms ( average 1940 census value : $8,742 ) brought in an average 1943 income of $7,817 . <P> But the farmers of North Dakota had learned that they live in an exacting country of violent extremes . Withering summer heat ( up to 124 ) follows hard on paralyzing blizzards ( down to - 40 ) . To scratch a living , a man must be both tough and lucky . North Dakotans are also hardheaded . They know all about poverty . Wealth is fine while it lasts . But next year - or the year after-hard times may come again . While the present boom continues , practical citizens have paid off mortgages ( $33 million in the last four years ) , oversubscribed by 81% on " E " bonds in the Fourth War Loan Drive , and stuffed the state 's little , weathered banks with $300 million . <P> Last week in Watford City , its 95 government bins groaning with grain , its four elevators busily cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Lean , grizzled old Lawyer W. S. ( " Bud " ) Taylor sat back from making out income tax returns ( at $3 each ) and pulled on his pipe . " These boys are really rolling in dough this year . When the Lord gets around to raining on this land , it 'll raise anything . " <P> Dr. Harry Ulysses Winter , the country 's only dentist , was booked up solid for seven weeks . Running two " operating rooms " simultaneously ( with " lots of gold work " ) , he had his lunch brought in , worked in his laboratory at night . <P> Blaine Whipple , editor of the weekly MacKenzie County Farmer and Watford Guide , never had fatter advertising lineage or a bigger circulation ( 1,771 paid-up subscribers ) . <P> Farmer P. L. Peterson , 59 , had a record year . He hired a man ( at $7 a day ) ; paid $1,000 to have his combining done ; paid $1,000 in old seed loans , $800 in back taxes , $400 in income taxes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondhand Ford , an electric cream separator , a washing machine , an electric iron and a radio ; surfaced the road leading up to the highway . He still had money left to buy war bonds and plunk in the bank .
