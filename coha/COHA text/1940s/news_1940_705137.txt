txt Chicago aldermen have been making a first hand survey of the quality of service provided by the Chicago Motor Coach company . The bus company is an especial object of interest because of its part in the proposed transit unification . The compans owners are asking that 10 million dollars be paid for the properties by the prospective unified transit company . A petition charging that the company 's profits are excessive and that the 10 cent fare should be reduced is pending before the Illinois Commerce commission . Here Are Alderman 's Findings . The conclusions of one of the aldermanic investigators were that the bus service is poor and that it is not worth the dime it costs . In more detail the findings of Ald. Frank Keenan 49th , a member of the city council local transportation commit . tee , who surveyed bus transportation on the north side , were as follows : I. Too few buses are operated during rush hours . 2 . Fumes in the buses make them uncomfortable . 3 . The buses are jammed with riders beyond ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers is endangered by packing buses so full that the drivers do not have a clear view of street traffic . 5 . One man operation , used on all the company 's buses , slows up the service . 6 . Persons waiting at bus stops arc frequently passed up because the buses are overloaded . 7 . The company 's heavy buses tear up the streets , altho the company pays nothing for use of the streets . 6 . Ten cents is too much for the kind of ride the bus company gives . Teat Bus Elites Taken . Test bus rides on the north side , taken by Ald. Heenan accompanied by a Tribune reporter , began on a recent weekday morning . They boarded a Sheridan road limited " bus  --  a 72 passenger dote bie decker ? at 9 a. nt. at Devon ave . nue and Broadway , where a terminal is located . Altho the big downtown rush was over , all 72 seats were filled on the bus before it had traveled a mile . By the time it reached the Edgewater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleven of them were jammed in a huddle between the driver and the front entrance . These passengers prevented the driver from having a clear view to his right . At one stop a woman rushed up to board the bus . just as the driver was closing the doors . The driver 's vision was so blocked and he was so busy trying to make change and drive the bus that he neither saw nor heard her . Many Stand Most of Way . Passengers were still standing when the bus crossed the Michigan avenue bridge , and it was two more blocks before there were seats for all riders still aboard . It was then 9:40 , making a total of 36 minutes that some of the passengers had put in endeay. oring to keep their balance as the packed vehicle made its way to the loop . The trip from Devon and Broad ? ay to State and Jackson streets took 47 minutes . Aid . le:enan also rode a Sheridan road " limited " bus home from the loop in the evening . Accompanied by the reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at State and Jackson . At State and Madison streets , after a journey of only three blocks , all seats were filled , and before the bus reached Michigan avenue , 24 passengers jammed the aisle . Overloaded In Few Blocks . The bus was overloaded when it crossed the Michigan avenue bridge . Crowds of would-be passengers waiting north of the bridge watched the bus lumber northward . The ride to Devon and Broadway took 50 minutes . " I could have paid the same fare and reached the same destination in less than 30 minutes on the etcvated , " Aid . Heenan said . " My reaction is that the bus company overcharges and even then does n't give decent set-vice . " The motor coach company refuses to provide owl service In the morn . ing . By trying to economize with one men operation , it slows up service and endangers passengers . It could reduce bus fares and put on more buses and still make a reasonable profit .
