Lieut . Hans Strehl , 23 , and Lieut . Siegfried Schmidt , 25 , both Nazi airmen , both prisoners of war at the Fort Henry internment camp outside Kingston , Ont. , seem to have literal minds . Not long ago they apparently got a copy of Pickwick Papers from the camp library , and came across the passage in which Weller the elder suggested that the hero escape from his imprisonment in the Fleet with the help of a piano : <P> " Me and a cab'net-maker has devised a plan for getting him out . A planner , Samivel-a planner ! " said Mr. Weller , striking his son on the chest . . . . <P> " Wot do you mean ? " said Sam . <P> " A planner forty , Samivel , " rejoined Mr. Weller , in a still more mysterious manner , " as he can have on hire , vun as vo n't play , Sammy . " <P> " And wot ' ud be the good of that ? " said Sam . <P> " Let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back , Sammy , " replied Mr. Weller . " Are you awake now ? " <P> " No , " rejoined Sam . <P> " There ain'r no vurks in it , " whispered his father . " It ' ull hold him easy , with his hat and shoes on , and breathe through the legs , vich is holler . Have a passage ready taken for ' Merriker . The ' Merrikin gov'ment mil never give him up , ven they find as he 's got money to spend , Sammy . " <P> Lieuts , Strehl and Schmidt seemingly decided that old Weller , whose super-cockney sounded like their own German accent of English , had something there . They made their plans slowly . <P> Finally they asked their captors if they might throw a little party in Fort Henry 's recreation hall . The captors said yes . Might they rent a couple of pianos from Kingston for the party ? Yes . <P> The pianos came , the party was held . <P> Last week , the rental period having expired , truckmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to their truck , took it back to town , rolled it on to the platform of the C. W. Lindsay Piano Co . A few minutes later the company 's bookkeeper heard sounds inside the piano that were too big for mice , too small for snapping piano wire . He investigated , found a young man wiggling out from a half-opened panel . The bookkeeper , who in all his years around pianofortes had never seen one with a man in it , called the police . They found the young man had 25 feet of quarter-inch rope wound around his leg , carried vitamin tablets in his pockets . He was Hans Strehl . <P> Some one remembered that there was another piano to be fetched from the camp . He warned the guards . The guards looked at the piano . Siegfried Schmidt was in it .
