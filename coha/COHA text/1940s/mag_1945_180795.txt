A onetime driver of the crack Sydney-Melbourne express became Prime Minister of Australia last week . By a 3-to-1 vote , Joseph Benedict ( " Chif " ) Chifley was chosen by the Parliamentary Labor Party to succeed the late John Curtin . <P> In the 18 years since he left the engine cab for politics , Chifley has not lost his capacity for hard work or his liking for the dark suits all Australian engine drivers seem to wear off duty . As wartime Treasurer , he and his wife set Australians an example in austerity by living on $8 a week . A bone- &-marrow; union man , he regards capitalists as " ordinary blokes " who will embrace socialism of their own free will . With Chif at the political throttle , the Commonwealth looked set for another long haul on the leftist limited .
