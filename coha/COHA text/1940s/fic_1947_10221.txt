" You must understand , Hartley , " said the P.A. , " the last thing I was looking for was to get . a business on my hands . But until we have raised more money I carry the responsibility for this check . Will it be satisfactory to you if I allow you three hundred a month out of it ? " " And how much will you take ? " " I 'll be satisfied with two hundred at the start , " Lanny said . He had to take something , because he was supposed to be hard up . " You should have more , Hartley , because you will be doing more work than I. You know more about the subject , and besides , I have to do some traveling to keep my art business going . " " That sounds fair , " admitted the other , showing his relief . " We shall have to pay office rent , and we must find an office with a telephone , because , as you know , new phones are practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I should think a business manager , since I do n't suppose you want to bother with the details of getting literature printed and distributed . " " It seems to me , " objected Hartley , " you 'll be getting rid of the money in a very short time and leaving us on the rocks . " " We 're only getting started , man . I 'm going to introduce you to other people , and you 'll raise a quarter of a million before you finish . Moreover , I have in mind a man who will work without salary , at least until we get going . It 's quite likely that he 'll put in a hunk of money when he sees what fine work we 're doing . " Lanny told the wonderful story of his friend Tom Cartier , who hated this stupid war and had used his family influence to keep out of it . He was looking round for something to do that would satisfy his conscience , and he was ready to take Lanny 's word for it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartley , well fortified with wine , swallowed every word of it and exclaimed : " Righto ! If you can produce a piece of magic like that , O.K. " Lanny said he could produce that magic the first thing in the morning . The agreeable young Virginian had a grandmother who owned the better part of a county down there , and she was much the same sort of person as Miss van Zandt ; they might visit her before long and get another check . Also , Carder had an uncle who owned a lot of real estate in New York and might be persuaded to rent them an office with a telephone , a treasure almost beyond price at the present moment . In short , Aladdin 's lamp was at work and Lanny said : " Notice that everything has happened as I promised you ! "  |p201Next  morning the pair met by appointment , and they picked up Cartier and drove into the park again . They stopped at a quiet place by the side of a drive , where they could talk for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that Hartley had done on the previous evening . Cartier had been studying the Communists ; he had attended their meetings and even one of their conventions , and he said that they were planning the after-the-war conquest of the world . He had read a volume of Lenin and could quote verbatim what the master Bolshevik had said on the subject of revolutionary versus bourgeois morality : how the Communists must always think of themselves as soldiers in a war , using all the devices which soldiers use against enemies . " When there is need of it , we must know how to employ trickery , deceit , lawbreaking , withholding and concealing truths . " In short , the lively young Virginian was a perfect model of a crusader on behalf of the American system of private enterprise , slanderouslycalled " capitalism " by the " Commies . " He was as ready for a fight as they were , and was n't going to be fooled by any of their camouflage . Hartley , who might or might not have believed what he said to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him , and his rosy English complexion shone with pleasure when Cartier announced that he had already talked with his uncle , who would let them have a suite of three office rooms at the ceiling price and with no secret rake-off because of the two telephones . Later on they went to inspect the place , which was everything the most fastidious propagandist could have desired . One of the rooms was to be Hartley 's private office , and Lanny wondered , could it really be , as Post had told him , that the disk of the dictaphone was so hidden in the desk that nobody could find it without taking the desk apart , and the wires so wound in with the telephone wires that only an expert could have detected them , and then only by cutting into the wires . The dictaphone was legal , while telephone tapping was not . However , this was wartime , and against the enemies of the nation the F.B.I . would probably do what it pleased . Whether Branscome alias Hartley would be so indiscreet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to invite them into that office , were questions which only time could answer . Cartier felt quite certain that the blondined young lady whom he introduced as stenographer and secretary would be able to keep the susceptible Englishman busy at dinnertime whenever the government men desired to make another search of his apartment . THERE came a call from Washington , and when Lanny called back it was Baker , telling him that an engagement had been made for him to meet Dr. Braunschweig in Princeton early the following afternoon . The day after that he would drive to the small town of Thurmont in the western part of Maryland , where he would find Baker and be taken to another appointment . " Both are for Mr. Prescott , " said the President'sman , and Lanny did n't have to ask for an explanation . The much-traveled P.A. packed his bags again and said to his forewarnedwife : " It 's a Number One matter , darling , so forgive me . " She answered that she had a Number One matter , too , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby or the book . She thought she was a feminist , but after all she was a woman in love . Millions of women were sending their men off to war , but they were n't enjoying it . He had told her about developments in the Hartley matter , because that might fairly be considered hers ; but he was n't free to mention the awful subject of atom splitting , nor the town in the Catoctin Mountains , which he guessed contained the President 's hideout . F.D.R. had dropped a hint that he had such a place , since the Secret Service and the Navy combined had refused to let him enjoy his former recreation of yachting . Not even Chesapeake Bay could be considered safe in these days of triumphant submarines . Lanny took a bite of lunch early and set out . His route was the same as he had taken to Washington , and he had learned that you could n't count upon making speed on Highway Number i . He had been told to go to the Institute of Advanced Study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car down the street from this new Gothic building . He announced himself as Mr. Prescott to see Dr. Braunschweig , and in a minute or two he was seated in the modest study of the learned scientist . He was perhaps ten years younger than Lanny , but what he knew about the universe was appallingto a mere art expert . Over a period of two months in the previous summer he had tutored Lanny for an hour or two every day , and most of the time Lanny had had to learn words and formulas like a parrot , without being able to understand at all what they meant . He had come away with the feeling that this dark-eyed , rather frail , and extremely serious young physicist possessed a brain of a type wholly beyond the imagining of the ordinary man . Sir James Jeans had written that " the universe appears to have been designed by a mathematician , " and that sentence had stayed in Lanny 's mind . This time the tutoring would n't take so long , because Lanny would be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alston had said that would be all right , provided he kept them pinned up in an inside pocket and destroyed them before he left the country . Dr. Braunschweighad a list of data which had come in during the past ten months concerning German progress in atomic research , and what particular details might be useful to the Americans . It was pleasant to hear him say that they believed the Germans were far behind , mainly because the Parer did n't believe in the possibility of atomic fission and had put his top physicists at other tasks . Lanny might have said : " He is concentrating on jet propulsion , " but he did n't . He listened with all the faculties he possessed , and when he did not understand he asked questions . He was embarrassed because he had forgotten so much of what he had previously learned . The physicist comforted him by saying that it was not to be expected that a man should remember so many details wholly outside the range of his own interests . Lanny had it all to do over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell himself that it was the most important subject in the world at this time . If he could gather the smallest mite of knowledge and have it passed on to the men who were working day and night in his country 's laboratories  --  that might be the best contribution he had ever made to the cause of freedom . This " advanced study " continued without interruption for a matter of four hours . Then the teacher said : " We will resume at eight o'clock ,  | if that is agreeable . " Lanny went out and telephoned his friend Alonzo Curtice , who had fed and sheltered him during the previous sojourn here . The art expert  --  so he was known here  --  explained that he was passing through and had a couple of hours . It meant inviting himself to dinner , but they had fed him something like a hundred and eighty times , and he was sure they would n't mind once more . He drove to the estate of this Wall Street investment banker and was welcomed by the owner and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough for anybody 's dinnertime , and the couple could feel repaid for their hospitality . Back to the advanced study , and time passed quickly , as it does when one is too busy to think about it . At about half-past ten there came a gentle tap on the study door , and there entered what to Lanny was a vision of delight  --  although entirely different from the one to which the poet Wordsworth had referred . It was a gentleman in his middle sixties , short and well filled out , with a rounded cherubic face , a small gray mustache , and a floating mist of uncontrollable white hair . He came in with that mischievous smile and two hands outstretched , and then appeared to change his mind and put his arms around the visitor and patted him on the back with both hands . " Willkommen , Herr Budd ! It is good to see you still alive ! "  --  which showed that somebody had told him about the accident . Then he turned to Dr. Braunschweig . " You are cheating me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The young assistant , who lacked a sense of humor , appeared flustered . " I am sorry , Dr. Einstein . " " I forgive you , but no more tonight ! You must not cram this easygoinggentleman ! " Then to the visitor : " You have a little time in the morning , nicht wahr ? You can spend the night at my house , and we can play . " " That suits me fine , " said Lannv , for he loved this warmhearted great man , one of the simplest and most genuine people he had ever met . Albert Einstein was comically out of place in this elegant universitytown , whose freedom and informality were of a conventional Englishsort . The wives of the faculty members must have had a hard time deciding how to deal with a German-Jewish scientist who forgot to keep his hair cut and went about the streets clad in a white shirt open at the throat , a pair of baggy pants , sandals , and no hat . In cold weather , when he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar , just about the most plebeian article of apparel that an academic hostess could imagine.  |p205The  two friends strolled over in the moonlight to the old and entirelyunpretentious frame house which sheltered the discoverer of formulas which had changed the thinking and destiny of the human race . A wistaria vine , now loaded with blossoms , covered the front porch and filled the night air with scent . Apparently the door was n't locked ; the master just walked in and turned into the parlor , which had a piano and a good music stand , also a table and several chairs . " Any room will do to think in , " he had told Lanny , and apparently any room would do to play the music of Mozart and Bach . The professor picked out the violin and piano scores of Mozart 's sonatas and set the former on the music stand and the latter on the piano rack . He got out his fiddle , tuned it , and said : " Also ! We played the first three . Shall we start with four ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greatest mathematician in the world has room in his head for the numbers we played nearly a year ago ! " They played Number Four , which is delightful , and then they played Number Five , which is also delightful . The old gentleman apparently knew the scores by heart , for he played with his eyes cast upward most of the time and an expression of heavenly bliss on the rounded , cherubic face . He played well , for this had been his form of recreation since early childhood . He had been very poor and had had a hard struggle to get along in the world and to win an education ; he had been slaving for seven years as a clerk in the Swiss patent office when he had evolved the physical formulas which had revised the Newtonian conception of the universe . They played the proper allowance of three sonatas ; more would have been a dissipation  --  so the learned professor had said the first time and he repeated it . They sat for a while and talked about the bad state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made two cheese sandwiches , which they washed down with a pint bottle of beer divided between them . " Friendship is a delightful sentiment , and lends a glow to the most ordinary actions of life , " thus spoke the author of The General and the Special Theory of Relativity as he escorted his friend upstairs to a modest chamber . In the morning , or rather , later the same morning , he fed the guest a light breakfast and then said : " It will be better if you walk alone to the office , for it happens , unfortunately , that I am an object of some curiosity . It is as if people came to see the giant panda "  --  this with his shy twinkle . Lanny made his way back to the Gothic building and spent another three hours of the hardest kind of mental work . The lesson over , he said his thanks to the solemn young physicist . " You have taken a lot of trouble with me , " he remarked . A shadow seemed to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied , " I have a very special interest in what you are doing . The Nazi gangsters are every man 's enemy . They are doubly mine . I am a Jew . " They both knew that they were playing with the fantastic notion of an atomic bomb , and the issue at stake was whether a missile of such destructive power should land on Berlin before it landed on New York or Washington . The Professor wished to say good-by , so Lanny was taken into his office , or perhaps it was the seminar room , Lanny could n't be sure . It had a large table in the center and several leather-seated chairs . As any room would do to think in , so any pencil would do to jot down a formula , and any piece of paper to receive it . Lanny knew that Einsteinwas now searching in the recesses of his unfathomable mind for the formula of what he called his Unified Field Theory , which would reconcile his Special Theory of Relativity with his extension of Max Planck 's Quantum Theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recently he had thought that he had it , but it had n't worked out , so he had told Lanny sadly . Now he bade farewell to this agreeable guest . " Gluck auf , Herr Budd ! I know that what you are doing is dangerous , and I wish I had as much courage . " " Did n't it take courage to upset the entire scientific world ? " inquiredthe P.A. mildly . " Oh , that ! " replied the Professor . " That is not so much . I have a mathematical mind and it will not rest . It goes its own way into the far reaches of this mysterious universe and I can not hold it back . It finds harmony where chaos once seemed to reign . " The great physicist said that , and then a shadow darkened his face . " It is a dreadful thing that we are doing now , trying to unlock the secrets of atomic power for purposes of war . The future will hold us responsible for the use we make of that knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leben Sie recht wohl ! " Lanny followed the highway as far as he could and then struck off to the west through the rolling farm country of Maryland . Fields and orchards and woodlots and farmhouses were rolling by , but he withheldthe attention he ordinarily gave to such a panorama ; his mind wasp207absorbed with the subject of atomic fission and the means of producing it , and , more important yet , of controlling the process . It was something new and terrible in the world , and he never tired of speculating about the changes it might bring in human affairs . Gradually the land rose , and there came into sight the beautiful Blue Ridge mountains . Here , so Alston had told the P.A. , an area in one of the National Parks had been set aside for the use of a Chief Executive who could not walk and had been deprived of his recreations of fishing and swimming . Oddly enough it was the Navy which had taken charge of this forest preserve ; the crew of the presidential yacht Potomac and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the help of local mountain labor , and put in a paved road and a group of buildings for use as a rest camp . Now they guarded and ran it , and the President motored each week end from the capital , bringing officials and others with whom he desired to have conferences . Churchill had been here twice , and various generals and admirals , to consult with him ; but not a line about it had appeared in any newspaper . Lanny did not enter the little town of Thurmont , but telephoned from outside . He was told to be in front of the post office at eight o'clock that evening and he would be picked up iii the usual way . Meantime he parked his car in a grove of chestnut trees alongside a little stream and sat and studied his atomic notes . Later he found a roadsideinn and had a bit of supper , and then studied some more until it was time to drive into the town . Precisely on the minute he stepped into Baker 's car and was driven up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to the camp . It was ten or twenty degrees cooler here than in the sweltering city of Washington ; a gentle night breeze murmured through the trees , and fireflies showed their mysterioustiny lights . Lanny , who was worried about his great leader 's health under the terrifying strain of war , thought this hideout the pleasantest discovery he had made in some time . He felt free to ask questions on the three- or four-mile drive . Baker told him there was a massive lodge built of local timber , a number of smaller cabins , a swimming pool . and fine trout streams running through the area . One of these emptied into an abandoned quarry near the lodge , and this made a unique fishing place , well stocked with rainbowtrout from the government 's hatcheries . A feature of the main building was that one wall was on heavy hinges so that it could be let down like a drawbridge , making a ramp on which the President could be wheeled out in case of fire . Also , in the rear , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen mountain camps all the way from the Adirondacks to Bavaria , and many of them had cost more than the twenty-five thousand dollars this one represented . Also he was used to having flashlights turned upon his face , to make sure that he was the person expected . Baker had the right to bring anybody in , and no questions were asked . In the entrance hall , while they waited to be announced , Lanny surveyed a map of " Shangri-La , " as this place was called . He noted that here , as everywhere , Americans had to have their fun . This building , the President 's home , was labeled " The Bear 's Den " ; the laundrywas " The Soap Dish " ; the building set aside for the Filipino stewardswas " Little Luzon . " There was a row of cabins marked " Baker Street Urchins " on the map , and Lanny asked whether these were named after his escort . The reply was : " The Secret Service men get their names from Sherlock Holmes , not from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entered the President 's room . Roosevelt was resting on a couch by an open window , wearing tan-colored linen trousers and a soft white shirt ; he gave a welcoming hail , as always . Seated beside him was a man in his fifties whose featureswere familiar to all readers of newspapers . He was tall and thin , with deep-set , keen brown eyes , a sallow skin , hollow cheeks , and a prominent lower jaw . He was loosely put together , slouchy in his way of sitting , and informal in manner . He was a harnessmaker 's son from Iowa who had gone through college in the American fashion , by working his way . He had devoted most of his life to social service , first for the Red Cross , then for the Tuberculosis and Health Associationin New York , then as chairman of the New York State TemporaryEmergency Relief Administration . When the newly elected President had been faced with the worst financial collapse in the world 's history , he had given this man the enormous job of finding work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President above all other men , and hated by the President 's enemies to the same extent . In this war crisis he was working himself literally to death  --  he had had a perforated ulcer and now had a rare intestinal disease , and he looked rather ghastly as he lifted himself out of his chair to greet the new arrival . " Lanny Budd , this is Harry Hopkins , " said the President . And Lanny said : " I have never had the pleasure before , but I had plenty of timep209to look at you , something over a year ago , when we ' crossed on the same Clipper . " " I remember your face well , " said " Harry the Hop , " as his genial Boss called him . " I did n't suppose you were seeing anything on board , Mr. Hopkins , except the papers in your portfolio . I took the liberty of guessing that they contained the lend-lease figures . " " You were correct , of course . " " Later on , " added the ex-playboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had landed with only one shirt and no hat , and that you had had to go to work without having time to shave . " " I see that you move in the best circles , " was the dry reply . " My father used to complain that you were spending more money than any one man in the world ever did before . That was in the . old W.P.A. days . Now , doubtless , you are spending ten or twenty times as much , but my father does n't seem to mind it at all . " " He is getting so much of it himself , " put in the President , and all three of them enjoyed a laugh . They got down to business quickly , there being little time for joking these days . " I want you to know Harry , " said " the Boss , " as Harry called him . " He will be in London while you are there , and I should like you to report to him anything interesting that you may come upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine ! " said Lanny . " Churchill has told me about your idea of having a talk with Hess . That is interesting , and all right with me ; but I do n't want you to go into Germany . There are others we can send , and I ca n't spare you . " " All right , Governor . My wife will call that good news . " " There will be danger enough where you are going . I want you in Vichy France and North Africa . It may seem like treading in your old footsteps , but events are moving fast , and we need every item of information about the attitude of the big people there . Some of them are bound to be worried , and more so as the summer passes . Some will be ready to desert a sinking ship , and we want to know who they are and how we can use them . It 's going to be a dirty business , and you may have your faith in human nature greatly tried . But keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , which is to save the lives of American boys and win this war at the lowest price in blood . " " Yes , Governor , " replied the P.A. meekly . He took it as an answer to the objections he had been raising , as to the wisdom of dealing with the rats deserting the Vichy ship . " Remember our clear intention  --  the French people will decide the future of France , and we have no wish to do it for them . Our job is to put down the Nazis , and after that to see a free and fair election in every country we have entered . " " I get you , Governor . " It was the nearest to an order the son of Budd-Erling had ever received , and it pleased him because it relieved him of responsibility . He added : " Professor Alston wants me to go to Switzerland and meet my old-time labor and Socialist friend there . " " That 's all right ; Switzerland , Spain , Portugal , wherever you think there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . It is possible you might get some of your Nazi friends to meet you in Switzerland . What is the name of that musician ? " " Kurt Meissner . He would come if I asked him , but I 'd have to have something important to tell him , and something he could believe . It would be a dangerous game , because I 'd be attracting attention to myselfagain , and they might comb the world to find out about me . It would be pretty hard for me then to continue as an art expert . " " Does anybody really accept that since we 've entered the war ? " It was Harry Hopkins , his questions always direct and to the point . " I can never be entirely certain , " replied Lanny . " I suppose it varies with different persons . The French are polite , and they pretend to believe it . Nobody has accused me to my face , except some of my friends of the underground , where I got into a jam . I suppose the collaborateurswhisper about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely , and that helps . " The thin-faced chief of lend-lease nodded his head slightly . " That helps ! " he echoed . " I know ! " Lanny took the opportunity to bring in a subject that lay close to his heart . " The last time I saw Kurt Meissner I told him about a plot of some of our high-up business tycoons and Army people to kidnap the President and make him obey their orders . That made a tremendous hit with Kurt , and later on with Hitler when I saw him . I think I could still use that story , but I 'd have to report progress , and I might need to have some hint leak out here . But the Governor does n't seem to want that to happen . " Lanny was speaking to Hopkins , as if answering his question . Hep211took it for granted that F.D.R. 's best friend must know all about this affair , and Lanny wanted to know what the friend 's attitude was . This was not difficult , for Hopkins was an outspoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it was a subject about which he did n't want to talk , and then nobody could get a word out of him . Now he said : " So far those bastards have n't done anything but talk , and it 's one of the requirements of democracy that every bastard shall be free to shoot off his mouth . " " Even in wartime , Mr. Hopkins ? " " Even in wartime , Mr. Budd . The Nazis can liquidate people for talking , and so can the Communists ; but if we do it , we have lost the war before we fight it . " " And more than that , Lanny , " put in F.D.R. , " you must admit that it would n't help morale either at home or abroad to let people know that such a junta exists in this country . " " You are the boss , " replied Lanny . " I am just pointing out that this is the one way I can get any Nazi to warm up and talk to me as a friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their path . " " You do n't tell me ! " responded Herr Rosenfeld with one of his infectiousgrins . " Do this , Lanny . Tell them anything that will help to loosen them up , and when you come back report to me about it , and I may figure out some way to give you a bit of support . " Then , suddenlyserious , he pointed to papers on a table beside him . " Here is a stack of orders that I must sign tonight ; so you two fellows go into the next room and get acquainted . " Lanny had read much about this chief boondoggler and leaf raker who now made his home in the White House ; a greatly abused man , but he did n't seem to mind it  --  he had chosen his enemies carefully . He did n't believe in the system of monopoly capitalism any more than Lanny did , and he did n't care if his system of relief by public spendingbrought the profiteers nearer to their doom . He had been quoted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall spend and spend , and tax and tax , and elect and elect . " He had carried out this program to such good effect that his great friend and hero had become the first man ever to be elected President for a third term , and by all the political signs he might have a fourth term if he wanted it . Now the harnessmaker 's son had set out to put the Nazi-Fascists out of business by the same method of unlimited spending . Oddly enough , he had most of the big businessmen behind him in this , but that did n't either worry him or please him especially ; he had only two-thirds of a stomach left , and no time or strength for a superfluous emotion . He had reports to study , orders to give , quarrels to abate . He had to fly to England with the President 's instructions and guide the controversiesof high-ranking British and American staff officers , bringing them to an agreement as near as possible to what the President desired . He needed all the help he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair in the next room , sliding down into it until he was sitting pretty nearly on the back of his neck , he opened up . " The Boss said to me : Lanny Budd is one of us . ' And that is enough . I want to talk to you frankly . May I call you Lanny ? " " Indeed yes . " " Call me Harry ; it comes easier . There 's going to be what the Englishcall a good show in London this month . We have to settle definitelyupon the plan of campaign . The Boss wants very much to invadeacross the Channel this summer , but Churchill wo n't hear of it ; he insists that we have n't the air power for anything but a defensive attitude , and he wo n't have anything to do with an invasion . But meantimethe Russians are clamoring and , strictly between us , threatening to quit if we do n't come to their help with a second front . So we have to do something . Churchill wants us to go up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind . " " Of course . He wants us to be in possession of that territory when the war ends , and to keep the Russians away from the Dardanelles . " " And of course our military men are not going to tie us up in any balance-of-power game between Britain and Russia . We want to heat the Nazis in the quickest way we can , and the cheapest with regard to the lives of our boys . So I think the decision will be for some action in North Africa this fall . That would cut Rommel off and be a minor disasterfor the Germans . It would settle the control of the Mediterranean and save us the tonnage we waste carrying stuff around Africa . Also , it would enable us to take Sicily and Southern Italy . " " And have airfields from which to bomb the munitions plants of Austria and southern Germany , " ventured the amateur strategist . " I see that you have the picture in mind . I 'm not saying that will be the final decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . If you are in London when the decision is taken , I 'll tell you about it . You wo n't be free to tell anybody else , but it will guide you in your work . "  | " That suits me fine , " replied the P.A. " I have a little daughter in England whom I 'd like to see . " " I know about her . I met Irma Barnes once or twice in night clubs before you married her . I did a little playing round with the smart crowd in those days . I wanted to understand their minds . It helps me now . " " The same for me , " replied Lanny with a smile . " But I liked some of them a bit too well . " They talked for a few minutes about people they knew ; but the burdensof the time pressed upon them , and presently they were talking about the bleak outlook before the country . The Germans had taken Sevastopol , and their plunge into the Ukraine had reached the Don River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deserts of Egypt called El Alamein , but it was uncertain if their line would hold . Hopkins said : " If the enemy gets to Suez , it may set us back for a long time . But do n't ever doubt it , Lanny , we are going to get the troops and the weapons and win this war ! " He wanted to question the son of Budd-Erling and proceeded to put him through the same sort of grilling as Alston had done . He desired to know everything there was to know about conditions in UnoccupiedFrance and French North Africa . Not merely , did he have to consider what materials must be allotted for a campaign there , but he had to start guessing what foodstuffs and other supplies might be requiredlater . Lanny told him that the natives , who wore nothing but cotton sheeting , were pretty nearly in rags now , and what they would look like after the havoc of an invasion was beyond any P.A.

The competent Baker came and took Lanny back to the town . On the way he said that he had been instructed to provide Mr. Budd with a properly visaed passport , and when would he want it ? Lanny said in about a week , and Baker said he would have to be in New York before that and would deliver the document personally . Also he would provide a ticket for him on the Clipper . Lanny gave Baker his phone number , and that was that.  | The sensible thing would have been to stop at a hotel for the night ; but the breeze was cool , and the moonlight on this foothill country so lovely , that he decided he would rather drive and think out some of his problems on the way .

Lanny had identified himself with a cause , and he lived in that and for that , and it kept him busy most of the time . Only rarely did the thought occur to him that the cause might fail ; and those were indeed uncomfortable moments . In that case , he reflected , he would n't want to survive  --  and probably would not be allowed to . Back by the same road he had come , a dog 's journey , as the saying goes . West of Wilmington he picked up Highway Number t again , and it was n't so crowded at one o'clock in the morning . The great trucks were moving slowly ; the factories were blacked out  --  hut all of them full of activity . Night or day was the same in wartime , and Lanny knew that was the case all over this vast land . America was going into action , preparing to show the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The P.A. had been that night in the brain center where the whole project had been conceived and from which it was directed . His whole being was afire with the sense of living in a great period of history , of seeing the world 's future in the making . With Tennyson 's Ulysses he could say : Much have I seen and known ; cities of men And manners , climates , councils , governments , Myself not least , but honor 'd of them all . It was after three o'clock when he arrived at the apartment . He had a key and let himself in quietly . He undressed in his own room , and the first awareness Laurel had of his presence was when he slid into bed beside her . He said : " Go to sleep again . I am tired . " She complied , and when later on she opened her eyes at the normal hour she lay still so as not to disturb him . That was easy for one who had not made herself a slave of the coffee habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan the story she was going to write that day . Later they prepared the combination meal known as " brunch , " and afterward he told her the news that he was scheduled to leave in a week or so . She could not hide the look of distress which crossed her sensitive features , and he hastened to say : " I am one of the lucky ones , darling . I 'm not going to be in any danger . 1 am only going where Ip215have been before ; first to London , where the bombing now amounts to almost nothing ; then to Vichy France and Algiers , where there is no bombing at all . " " And when am I to expect you back , Lanny ? " " I ca n't be sure about that . It is usually two or three months . It will surely be before your confinement  --  if you take care of yourself and do n't overwork . " She made the promise , but he was n't sure that she would keep it . She , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Art , and sometimes she could n't be sure whether it was more important to produce a baby or a minor masterpiece . She was modest about her talents but quietly determined to make the most of them , and she was rebellious against the vegetative state her condition called for . " Listen , dear , " he said , to spare her feelings ; " there are interesting things that I would give anything to be able to tell you ; but I am under explicit orders . It appears that the military forces are especially afraid of wives . " This brought a sparkle of mischief into her brown eyes . " I grant you , I have known a few who would not be good keepers of secrets ; but I have also known men of the same sort . " He answered : " Professor Alston tells me that in one single project with which I am concerned there are thousands of wives who have no slightest idea what their husbands are working on . " " Misery loves company , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been putting two and two together  --  a good many twos . Be sure I 'm not saying a word to Agnes or anybody else , and I 'm not having my feelings hurt . Some day you will tell me all about it , and I promise to be interested . " It was the sort of wife for a P.A. to have , and he put his arms about her and made plain with many kisses that he knew what a prize he had drawn in the marriage lottery . Downtown there was the efficient Mr. Post , an executive with many problems on his mind , and just now a-smile on his face after the fashionof the cat which has swallowed the canary . " Hartley has talked over the telephone , " he said , " and has made appointments which he must have thought sounded innocent . We have picked up the people and I am awaiting more reports today . I think they are the men we are looking for . " Lanny said : " I have orders to leave for abroad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be within that limit . "  | " I think we have everything already , Mr. Budd . If you do n't mind , it will be better if you do n't say anything to Hartley until the day before you are going . No use to unsettle his mind . " " Quite so . I have a handy excuse  --  an important client who has given me a commission . I suppose it will be all right if I leave the propaganda business in charge of Cartier ? " " He is prepared to carry it on as long as necessary . Hartley wo n't like it , of course , but you can give him a raise in salary to salve his feelings . " " What troubles me , Mr. Post , is the fear that Hartley will get his mind fixed on me as being responsible for his betrayal . I do n't see how that can fail to happen . And sooner or later he or his associates will make their suspicions known to the enemy world . " " We mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budd . We shall not arrest any of these men until we are sure we have them all ; then we shall carefully prepare a story of how we came to detect them , and it will be a story which has nothing to do with you . " " It will be bound to get into the papers , will it not ? " " Unfortunately we can not avoid arraigning them in court , nor keep them from getting lawyers to represent them . But the account we give of the affair will reveal some clue which put us on their trail , one which will convince them and leave no reason for suspecting you . " " But if Cartier testifies against them , and I introduced Cartier to Hartley  --  " " Cartier will never testify . He will be arrested with them and arraignedwith them . He will be in a cell with Hartley and will pretend to be furious with Hartley for getting him into this jam . In the course of their arguments Hartley may reveal details of importance . If later on Cartier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gang , for they know perfectly well that Cartier was not in the secret of the diamonds and that his propaganda efforts were no crime . " " All that sounds plausible enough . But can Cartier afford to have his family name dragged into such a mess ? " " Cartier is not his real name , Mr. Budd . I apologize for not telling you that , but you know how it is , the less a man knows , the less chance there is that he may let something slip by accident . Cartier is a name for the occasion ; when he comes out of jail , he will be a martyr in the eyes of Miss van Zandt and people of her sort , and will he in an excellentposition to keep contact with them and report on what they are doing . " " That sounds all right to me , " declared Lanny . " I hope that amongp217those who will appreciate his martyrdom will be Mr. Harrison Dengue and the rest of the group who think so ill of President Roosevelt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared the F.B.I . man with emphasis . Lanny went up to the newly established office of the American Christian League , which so far consisted of three men and a secretary , unless you counted one elderly spinster on Fifth Avenue and her secretaryand companion . Things at the office were peaceful , but promisedactivity . Hartley had been to_the call on the spinster  --  without consultingLanny  --  and had brought back with him a manuscript which had been composed by a member of the numerous retinue which surroundedthis old lady and plied her with compliments day and night . It was entitled The Red Nightmare , and Hartley said that he had listenedcarefully to what Miss van Zandt thought of it , and then repeatedit all to her in more vigorous words , thus confirming her opinionthat he was a man of excellent judgment . He had asked if she did not think it would make a good opening shot for the new League , and she had assented . Lanny read the article and found it a collection of all the most uncomplimentarythings which had been said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he commented : " We could do better ; but if this is what Queen Hortensia wants , it is a command performance . " So they had something to do right away , and the efficient Tom Cartier had collected samples of other such propaganda literature and was in processof getting estimates for a first edition of ten thousand copies . Lanny said : " Let 's go easy on this one , because it 's really not very good , and if we send it to Miss van Zandt 's mailing list and put it on sale at a few meetings , that is all she will ever hear about and it will satisfy her . " " But we ought to be doing something at the office to make things look right , " said the Englishman . " I 'll make out a list of names and addresses of the right sort of people , and you and Cartier can get up a letter telling them about our work . " Lanny went back to the apartment where he had such a list , compiledduring the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dupes . He did n't in the least care how much money Bartley might collect , especially since he was hoping that the F.B.I . would scoop it all up in a few days . He told Laurel what he was free to tell her about it , and she helped by typing out the list . He said : " They wo n't get very far with it , because most of these people have their own movements and wo n't want any rivals ; but it will help to make it look like the real thing . " Next day Baker telephoned and brought the passport and the ticket for the Clipper , five days from date . Lanny took those precious documentsand put them in his safety-deposit box at the bank ; then he drove out to have lunch with his friend Mr. Vernon , who had just receivedthe shipment of the first mosaic from Algiers and was as happy as a child with a new toy . In truth there could be no jigsaw puzzle so fascinating ; all his friends had come in to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very rich , something entirely new . This countrygentleman , who had already paid Lanny 's bill in full , was now open to a proposition for a large and really beautiful Moorish fountain , used for ritual ablutions , which Lanny had observed on his last visit , but had n't quite had the nerve to buy . Mr. Vernon supplied the necessarycourage , and the art expert drove back to New York well content with his dap . It was n't that the money was so important , but he had a business letter to carry in his suitcase , to he read by all the spies and secret agents who would rummage through his belongings in the hotels of two continents . To his wife he said : " I think you have a holiday coming to you . Let 's have some fun before I leave . " So they packed several suitcases and stowed them in the car and drove on a warm summer evening through a thunder shower to the town of Newcastle and had a reunion with the Budd tribe . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open road . Next morning they set out along the little NewcastleRiver and into the Berkshire Hills ; from there northward to the foothills of the Green Mountains , and westward into the Adirondacks . Fine roads winding through endless pine forests , and vistas of mountains , tier behind tier , with rushing streams and blue lakes in the valleys  --  theywere reminded continually of southern Bavaria where Hitler had his eyrie , and where they had had their first adventure together . They had been in fear at that time and had n't been able to give much thought to scenery , but now by agreement they put all cares behind them and enjoyed their lives while still the little lamp shone . Freut end ) des Lebens well noch das Lampchen gliiht !  |p219They  had lunch at a summer-resort hotel , and Laurel slept for a couple of hours . Then they drove again , and toward evening came to the " camp " belonging to Lanny 's old friends the Murchisons . He had telephoned to make sure Adella was there , and on the way he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not won Beauty Budd in the carefree days before World War I , and how he had married his secretary on the rebound , and how Adella had taken Goya for her hobby and purchased several examples with Lanny 's advice . They had this comfortable camp on Saranac lake , and Adella was there with three women friends , enough to play bridge , but they were bored and glad to see company . In these days the men were all up to their ears in work in hot and smoky Pittsburgh ; so were most of the women , but Adella had overworked and the doctor had ordered her away , and she had brought with her three members of the " younger set " who were " expecting " and therefore had an excuse . Now Lanny had brought a fourth , and they could have a pleasant time sympathizing with one another 's symptoms while Lanny went fishing . In the course of his career he had caught a number of big political fish , but he did n't succeed in getting a single nibble from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Laurel was begged to stay and spend the summer in this cool delightful spot . But duty called her back to the sweltering city  --  she had to be near a library , so she declared . Adella said that Harry would be grieved at having missed them ; he might not get here more than once or twice in the whole summer . He had given his plane to the government , and it was n't considered patriotic to drive a car , and anyhow , you could n't get the gas . They all wanted to know how Lanny had got it , and he explained that the car belonged to his father , and Lanny was using a couple of months ' supply of ration coupons . Robbie , who had half a dozen cars , did n't have time to drive any of them except between his office and his home . They staved two days , and then set out again , through Keenc valley and past Schroon Lake , and so out of the mountains and down along a little river to Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Henry had been so disappointed not to find the Northwest Passage . In a couple of hours they were passing Krum Elbow , and Lanny said : " The Squire does n't have much time to look at his Christmastrees these days . " He said nothing about " Shangri-La , " and nothing about a P.A. 's duties ; but Laurel knew well what he was thinking . Her lovely holiday was over , and she was coming back into the world of suffering and danger.  |p220That  night , in their snug little nest , she said : " Let 's try one more seance . " They had held several , but always with disappointing results . Otto Kahn had talked only idle pleasantries and had reported that the " spirits " who made their appearance were persons of no social distinction , nor yet of intellectual ; he kept insisting that he knew nothing about the Holdenhursts and did not have the honor of the acquaintance of Laurel Creston 's grandmother . Now the time was growing short , for Lanny was to depart the day after next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anybody else . She had told her friend Agnes that sometimes she talked in her sleep , and not to worry about it if she heard it . They tried again ; and there was the genial banker , always on call . They could imagine him , dapper and elegant in his evening clothes , for surely he would not have appeared otherwise . He was ready to chat , but did n't have anything important to say . When they asked him to produce some of their friends in the spirit world he said that conditions here were difficult ; but he did n't explain why . He said there was a spirit named Hodges , who had been one of his  --  Otto 's  --  stockbrokers , but who was n't a very talkative man , especially where there was no ticker and no quotation board . There was tiresome old Sir Basil , as always ; and there was a lady who claimed that she had a special revelationfrom God . " You know how persistent these religious souls can be , " said Otto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " inquired Lanny . And the reply was : " How would I know ? " quite in the style of the New York sophisticates . When Lanny asked about Reverdy Holdenhurst and then about Lanny 's former wife Trudi , the banker said that he was feeling under the weather that evening , and his voice faded away . It was for all the world like a phonograph running down . Laurel came out of her trance and was told about all this . She asked , as she had asked before : " What can this fantastic thing mean ? " Lanny 's reply also had been heard before : " I 'd give a good part of what I own to anybody who could find out . " It was difficult even to talk to the average person about these phenomena . You might explain ever so clearly that you did n't pretend to know what these entities really were ; they called themselves " spirits , " and that was as far as you could get . The person would say " Spirits ! " and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and everybodyp221to whom he mentioned the matter would agree . But that would n't stop the phenomena from continuing , everywhere , all over the world . There were thousands of persons who had this mediumistic gift , and many who never made money out of it , and gave no signs of being " cracked . " The voices spoke and did their best to convince you that they were real , even to having their feelings hurt when they were n't believed . Laurel said : " The most amazing thing is that my subconscious mind should be full of such fragments of human personality of whom my conscious mind never can get direct knowledge , and that they should use my voice without my ever hearing it . If it is Otto Kahn really , why can he not speak to me when I am awake ? " " Ask him , " said Lanny , half seriously . The wife replied : " All right . " Then , after a moment 's pause : " Mr. Kahn , wo n't you kindly use my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere . " There followed a long silence ; no sound whatever , and Laurel felt no power tugging at her vocal cords . No , she would have to go back into that other kind of sleep , which she knew was different , although she could not say in what the difference consisted or how she managed to turn the switch that brought one kind instead of the other . " I suppose it 's a suggestion , " she said , " but how I give it I could not say . " " Do you know how you tell your muscles to lift you up from your bed or to let you down again ? You do n't know that , and the wisest scientist in the world can not tell you how a desire , or an act of will , can cause one of your muscles to contract . " There was another aspect of this subject pressing upon her mind . " Lanny dear , " she began , " there is something we ought to have an understanding about . You are going away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am really not going into any danger , darling . " " I know you have to tell me that , but I do n't want to fool myself . There is n't any safe place in Europe now , and everything will get worse before it gets better . What I want you to know is that if you should die , I wo n't be thinking about anything but trying to find you . Psychic research is just a curiosity now , but then it would become my life . Promise me you will try your best to come back to me ! " " Of course , Laurel ! "  | " I will go into a trance every night . Let us agree , exactly eight o'clock by New York time . You wo n't forget that ? " " Surely not . " " I will have Agnes sit by and tell me if you come . And if I do n't hear from you that way , I 'll go to other mediums and try . Do n't tell me now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tell them to me in the trance , so that later I can get Robbie or Beauty or others to verify them . " " Be sure that I 'll think up plenty of evidence , " he assured her , not without a smile . " Apparently I wo n't have much else to do . I ca n't find that the spirits ' ever seem to have any work . " " It 's curious ; they appear to be wandering about in a void , lost and bewildered . What little they do , they do n't seem to know how they do it . Let 's promise that , if we ever find ourselves in that world , we sha n't rest until we find each other . " " What else could interest us ? " " And when we do , we 'll get busy with some medium and devise a way to convince our friends on earth that it really is Lanny and Laurel and not just that old telepathy . ' " " It 's a bargain ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much good . Whatever the evidence might be , it would be embodied in one of the volumes of the Society for Psychical Research and gather dust on the library shelves . " He had become discouraged about trying to interest people in another world . It would have to wait until this world was a more decent place to live in . In the morning Lanny went to call at the F.B.I . offices . He found his reticent friend Mr. Post in a state bordering on complacency . " We have four men and one woman inside the trap at this moment and all we have to do is to shut the door . We are waiting for their chief , who is expected in the city tomorrow morning . Then we are ready to go into action . " " Good work ! " said the P.A. " Incidentally we have a story for the newspapers that will cornpletelycover you and lead them off the track . " " I have been thinking that over , " Lanny said . " I have a suggestion , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Imagine this for the moment . As soon as you give me the signal to/morrow that everything is ready , I rush into the League office very much excited . I tell Hartley I have just learned from the janitor of my apartment building that Federal agents have been there and ransacked the rooms in my absence ; that they have had my telephone wires tapped for weeks and have been getting the contents of my trash basket . I tell Hartley that I 'm going to bolt , and he had better do the same . I give him half of what is left of the money  --  or a little more . When he comes out of the building , your men nab him at the street door . Would n't that leave me in the clear ? " " The trouble is , Mr. Budd , he would n't bolt until he had telephoned at least one of his gang and told that one to warn the others . " " I have thought of that , too . You might have the telephone wires cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might not he possible to have his wire diverted in the exchange , or perhaps on the roof of the office building , and have a woman answer his calls ; and when he gives a number , sound the busy signal . That would make him try several different numbers , and it might be important for you , because  it might provide fresh clues . " " Let me think about that , Mr. Budd . " There was silence in the room for several minutes ; then the man said : " I ca n't see any flaw in that , and , as you say , it might bring us something new . But suppose you did n't find Hartley in the office tomorrow morning ? " " I have promised him a check today , and I can phone him and say that I am very much rushed and will see him the first thing in the morning . " " What hour will suit you ? " " The earlier the better ; I am taking the Clipper for England at noon . What time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive ? " " He is not going to arrive in the city ; we are going to take him off the train at a near-by stop , for fear that he may be intending to get off before he reaches the city and transfer his valuable baggage to somebody else . We can be ready for action at ten tomorrow , if that is agreeable to you . " " Exactly right , " Lanny said . " I 'll be packed and have my bags in the car . " I will phone you at nine if all goes well . I will say your name three times  --  Budd , Budd , Budd . That will mean that arrangements are completeand that you are to proceed to the League office and carry out your part . If there is a delay , I wo n't phone ; just wait at your place until I do . "  | " Do n't make it too late , " Lanny replied . " I have a really important mission and I ca n't afford to miss that Clipper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In case of emergency I could call the airport and arrange to have the Clipper wait for you . " Lanny chuckled . " I have thought myself important sometimes , but never that much ! " The P.A. went home and from there telephoned Hartley . " I have good news for you , " he said , " also some money . I 've been out of town , and I 'm crowded today , but I 'll see you at the office in the morning without fail . " That was that , and he set about writing letters to his clientsand making business arrangements for his trip . In the evening he took Laurel for a drive and told her what was in the wind . It was a relief to be able to tell her something , and this was an achievement in which she had a part . It seemed to her the height of melodrama  --  and so indeed was everything connected with this war . She was so excited that she wondered if she could sleep , so he took her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending every momenttogether that they could . When they came home , and she was undressed and ready for bed , she suggested : " Let 's try one more seance . " She lay down and closed her eyes , and Lanny sat by the bedside , waiting for any voice that might speak . But there came no voice , only the sound of gentle breathing , and after a while he realized that his tired wife had made the wrong mental connection , had got aboard the wrong train . He lay beside her , speculating over the question of how this had happened and what it meant . Had there been spirits waiting to communicate , and were they now disappointed ? Would they wake her up , or would they come to her in her dreams ? Here was the thing called sleep , just ordinary sleep , and yet what a strange thing ! In it his wife went off into a world of her own , often a completely crazy world of fears and adventures in which she was apart from her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fickle pensionersof Morpheus ' train . " Lanny was possessed by the thought of how little man knows of himself and his own mind . In the morning the P.A. finished his packing , and sat reading the papers , full of disturbing news which he could not think about con/secutively . His wife 's nerves were also on edge , for she had had bad dreams , she told him ; she was becoming what the world called superstitious . The phone rang ; it was Robbie to say good-by , and Lanny had to excuse himself : " I am expecting a call about an urgent matter . I 'll call hack before I leave . " Then silence again , and more waiting ; until at last came another ring , and the voice of Post , giving the signal : " Budd , Budd , Budd . " Lanny answered with " Roger , " which was part of the lingo of the war . " Start now , " said the voice . His car was at the door , and he took his bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the airport and would drive the car back to the garage . A girl from Robbie 's office would come and get it there . Robbie had offered to leave the car , but Laurel did n't want it ; she said that taxis were easier in big-city traffic . Lannv drove to the neighborhood of the League office and managed to find a parking space on a side street some distance away . He walked to the office quickly , so that he might have color in his cheeks . Once , years ago , when his friend Rick had been writing and staging plays , he had watched an actor behind the scenes working up excitement preparatory to bursting in upon the stage . Now Lanny did the same , and found no great difficulty , for he really was nervous , having thought of so many things that might go wrong . There was Hartley , waiting , and the little drama was played through convincingly enough . When Lanny told the bad news the Englishman leaped up , exclaiming " Good God ! "  --  this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to get out of there instantly ; but then he thought of his confederates and said : " Wait a moment ! " and took up the telephone , just as Post had predicted . He gave a number , and Lannv , standing near , could hear the busy signal . " Oh , hell ! " the man exclaimed , and gave another number . Lanny said : " I ca n't wait , " and planked a roll of bills down on the table . " This will keep you going . " And then : " When things have settled down you can write me in care of my father . Mark it personal . " He turned and bolted out of the room . And that was all there was to it . Lanny observed a dapper young man standing in the hallway , and two more down at the entrance of the building . He hoped they would n't mistake him for Hartley , and they did n't , He hurried to the car and drove to one of the East River bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaplane was resting in the water basin . On the way he told his wife about what had happened , and when they reached the airport he called up his friend Post and said : " This is the man whose name is pronounced three times . " The answer was : " Everything is jake , and we are everlastingly obliged to you . " Lanny added : " If ever I want to take up a stage career , I 'll come to you for a recommendation . " There was time to spare , so he showed his wife what a luxurious vehicle he was going to travel in . She did her best to pretend that it comforted her , but she had learned that he was flying north , by much the same route on which he had been wrecked before . Now and then her lips would tremble , but she said very bravely that she did n't want to make it hard for him and would go on and do her work , and learn to pray , after the fashion of his esteemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they strolled up and down until the last call carne . Then he gave her a long kiss , and with tears running down her cheeks she said : " Do n't forget , if anything goes wrong , I 'll still be waiting for you . " " Eight P.m. on the dot , " he answered , and forced a smile , because it is embarrassing to a man to have to wipe his eyes in public . He went aboard , and the great seabird glided out into the Sound and rose into the air and away . It was a warm and quiet July day , and all the prognostications were favorable . Lanny had plenty of things to read , and a good appetite  --  he told himself that he had helped with an important job and might help with others , and he could n't do any good to the Allied cause by worrying about it . No voyage could have been pleasanter . He was flown to Newfoundland , this time to the seaplane base of Botwood on a clear blue sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its many glaciers and boiling springs ; now many Yanks were there  --  or " G.I. 's , " as they were calling themselves , playing with the idea that they were " governmentissued , " like everything else they touched . The Icelanders had n't invited them and were making the best of a trying situation . Lanny saw few of them , for the plane paused only to refuel ; it sped on through the unbroken daylight , and set its passengers down in the harbor of Prestwick in western Scotland , now a great airport . When he presented his credentials he was concerned lest the P.M. 's secretarymight have overlooked the little matter of having a name taken off the blacklist ; but evidently it had been done . The official , speaking with a strong Scottish burr , bade him welcome to the United Kingdom.  |p227The  first thing Lanny did was to borrow one of those little sheets , made up of four half-size pages , which passed for a newspaper in a nationunder siege . There , under a modest headline and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Bureau of Investigationhad just arrested a group of five men and one woman charged with purchasing diamonds in America and smuggling them to Sweden , from there to be taken into Germany . Names of the gang were not given , but there was a dramatic story as to how the discovery of this conspiracy had happened to be made . It was narrated that a man walking on Broadway had been observed to draw his handkerchief from his pocket , and from it had dropped a rough diamond . The man who saw the incident chanced to be himself a " diamond man , " and he picked up the stone , intending to return it to the owner ; but first it occurred to him to walk ahead and look at - the man 's face . Diamond men are a small group and rather clannish , and they know one another ; but this man was a stranger . Realizing that it was wartime , and that diamonds were among the most important of war materials , the man had followed the stranger to his hotel , observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then had called the F.B.I . There had followed a patient and careful job of detective work , continuingfor several weeks . Lanny chuckled to himself as he reread the story ; he did n't begrudge the hard-working agents the credit they had taken  --  he surely did n't want any share of it for the son of Budd-Erling . He thought that the story put him " in the clear . "  | LANNY 'S first thought in England was of his little daughter . He had cabled Irma , and as soon as he reached London he telephoned the Castle to ask if it would be agreeable for him to call . It always had been , but he never neglected the formality . The relationship of a man to his ex-wife and her new husband is a difficult one at best , and the pair were trying to show what good manners could achieve in that field . Irma said : " Frances has asked about you every day for more than a year . " Lanny plight have made some joking remark about how trying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor was not Lady Wickthorpe 's strong point , so he replied : " I appreciate your patience . " Gone were the good old days when Lanny had been able to step into his car and run out to Wickthorpe Castle in less than a couple of hours . Now he had to look up a timetable , and get to Paddington stationon time , and be jostled by crowds that never failed to be there in spite of the government 's efforts to reduce travel . When he stepped off the train he found that the child had come to meet him , driving her pony-cart , with a groom riding behind . Fourteen months had passed , and he was amazed when he saw her  --  this tall , long-legged girl ! But when she flung her arms about him and kissed him , it was the same Frances , more demonstrative than her mother , more like her father in temperament , and having to be continually repressed . " Oh , Father , why did you take so long ? " None of the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Irma had always disapproved . The groom touched his hat , and tucked two suitcases under his feet and the typewriter on his lap , and the pony trotted off  --  a properly trained English pony who knew that the right side of the road was the wrong side and that the left side was the right side . And while the well-trimmed hedges of an English village glided silently past them ,  |p231Frances  plied this wonderful , rarely seen father with questions about where he had been and what had happened to him . Presently he told her that he would make a bedtime story of it ; now she should tell him about herself and what she was studying and how the family was . So the floodgates were opened , and he learned the latest news about a castlewhich dated back to the time of Shakespeare and Sir Francis Drake , and which was an important factor in the life of this blessed isle , controllingthe destinies of something like a thousand people . The estate could n't have been kept going if it had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paramount Barnes of Chicago , a disciple of Sir Francis Drake who had operated in the field of street-railway finance instead of on the high seas . The people of the estate knew all about her ladyship 's fortune ; the men all touched their hats and the women smiled and bowed to the little girl , and to her father , whom they knew at least by sight , for he had lived in a residenceknown as the Lodge years ago when he was still Irma 's husband . These proper villagers tried their best not to think of this as a scandal , but as something exotic , characteristic of the wild and woolly West , which they took Chicago to be . After all , Britain was an empire , and might receive a visit from the King of Dahomey , or the Akhoond of Swat , bringing not one extra wife but four , the limit permitted to Mohammedans . The Countess of Wickthorpe emerged from the " lift " which was a part of her modernization of the Castle . She wore a white housedress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Lanny 's first thought was that the monster of embonpoint had been licked by the war ; Irma appeared at least ten pounds lighter , and it became her well . She greeted him cordially , saying : " You have stayed away from us a long time ! " Apparently she had never learned that he had been put on the blacklist by B4 ; he did n't tell her , for the less gossip there was on that subject the better . He told her that he had found travel less easy to arrange . As on the last occasion , he was going to be put up in the cottage occupied by Mrs. Fanny Barnes , Irma 's mother ; and , as before , he said that would be perfectly agreeable . So many friends had fled the capital , Irma explained . Some of the refugee children had gone back to London , but they might be coming again any day  --  there were rumors of deadly new German weapons . Lanny said he had heard such rumors ; and so they got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict which was wrecking the modern world and could only end in the triumph of the Bolshevik terror . Conversation at Wickthorpe was n't very entertaining these days , for all roads led to Moscow . His Lordship came in from making the rounds of the estate . He was playing the role of country gentleman , having taken the increase of food production as the one rational thing a man could do in a mad world . He rode horseback , because petrol was so scarce . His erect figurelooked well in a riding suit and his blond hair shone when he took off his hat in the sunshine . He shook hands cordially with his old friend Lanny , asked after his health and that of his father and mother , and then fell to talking casually about the state of his crops . Such was his manner , and whether you had come back after fourteen days or fourteenyears would n't make much difference . Ceddy took life seriously , but rarely talked about it . The only place where he permitted the expression of emotions was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was deeply concerned about politics , both at home and abroad , but circumstances no longer permitted him to expound his ideas publicly . Once in the House of Lords , and then his duty was done ; people knew what he thought , and some day he would have the melancholy satisfaction of saying : " You remember what I told you ? " When he was among persons who agreed with him , he would speak freely , and few others were invited to the Castle nowadays . Lanny , in his role of near-Fascist , was one of these ; and in the evening , seated outside in the cool twilight , the wife , the husband , and the ex-husband enjoyed the luxury of complete agreement . Lanny , of course , was asked about his trip around the world and about his marriage in Hongkong . He said that his wife was a writer of magazine stories , but he did n't mention the character of her stories nor that her pen name was Mary Morrow . He answered questions about Hongkong and southern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited " Red " China , and said only that he had been permitted to fly out through Russia , but had had no opportunity to make observations . Much more interesting to the earl and his countess were his more recent experiences in Vichy France and North Africa . Ceddy , until recently a Foreign Office man , knew most of the appeasers in France and had done everything in his power to further their program . Now , apparently , it was too late ; Churchill was in the saddle , riding madly , and Britain was approaching a precipice , beyond which was the abyss of Bolshevism.  |p233Lanny  tried to be as cheering as he could . He said there was intense anti-Red feeling in America which was bound to produce a sharp reaction immediately after the war , however it ended . " How can it end , " asked Ceddy , " save in the ruin of Western Europe ? France will he a battlefield , and Germany completely exhausted . " When Lanny said that Russia would be exhausted , too , the other answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because those people breed like rabbits . And she will have all the border states , and China , too , and how long will it take her agents to stir up revolution in India ? " Such were the ideas which Lanny had always heard in this ancient castle . They were the ideas of the privileged in all the countries he visited , the people to whom class was more than country . Lanny hated the ideas , but it was his job to express agreement and listen , and find out what powerful persons were still spending week ends at the Castle and voicing these ideas and the latest schemes for putting pressure on statesmen to bring about a compromise peace . Lanny would go hack to London and type out a report and have it delivered to the American Ambassador . No doubt when F.D.R. received it he would tell some of it to Churchill over the transatlantic telephone , and sometimes it would be news to the anti-Nazi Prime Minister and sometimes not . When Lanny returned to London he phoned Rick , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration . Once a successful playwright , able to entertain even the carriage trade , Eric Vivian Pomeroy-Neilson now could n't think about anything except counteringthe intrigues of the Fascists and the near-Fascists all over the world . He despised the Cliveden and Wickthorpe sets and had been blasting them for years . For that reason Lanny no longer went to stay at The Reaches , Rick 's home ; the two men met in secret in a little hotel they had agreed upon . Lanny booked a room there , and the lame journalist and his sympathetic wife came and spent the day . What a time they had , catching up with fourteen months of personal history of two families , indeed of several more , for Nina and Rick knew both Robbie and Beauty and had to be told about them , and still more important , about Lanny 's marriage , and what sort of partner he had got . He had sent a photograph , and also the stories of Mary Morrowcut out of magazines ; but that was n't enough for Nina ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Laurel was living , and how she took her husband 's long absences.  | Lanny had to recite once more the story of his year 's adventures ; and this time he did n't have to hide anything , save only the name of President Roosevelt . He could tell Rick about China , and especially Yenan ; about Ulan-Bator and Kuibyshev and Moscow , and the twohourinterview with Stalin . Rick could make notes and could use this information in his writings , of course omitting anything that might point to Lanny as a source . The same was true for France and North Africa and other lands . For years before the war Lanny had been doing what he could to light the path of the British labor movement by bringing inside stories , forecasts , and warnings to this trusted friend , who would write them up and get them published , sometimes by a secret and indirect route . In return Rick would tell all that he knew about the course of events ; some of it inside stuff , for a baronet 's son had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share his political coloration but who respected him for his integrity and believed that the people had a right to know what was going on behind the scenes . In spite of all the Nazi atrocities , there were still influential persons who wanted to beat Hitler but not too badly , and who were dreaming of an agreement which would prevent the Reds from breaking into the Balkans and gaining control of the Dardanelles . Lanny told what he had heard over the week end at Wickthorpe , and Rick told what his father had heard among his associates in the Athenaeum and the Carlton clubs . Rick said there was going to be a big military powwow of the Allied staffs , beginning in a week or so , and he might be in a position to get some of the inside stuff . Lanny did n't say that Harry Hopkins had promised to tip him off on the same subject ; he just said : " Maybe I can learn something too . " Lanny 's arrangement with the Prime Minister had been that he was to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary , Mr. Martin . He did so , and received no direct answer , but next day was called to the telephone at his hotel , and a voice said : " Mr. Budd , this is Fordyce , whom you may possibly remember having met just before you left for home last year . " Lanny replied promptly that he would never forget . When the voice asked if he might have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Budd again , Mr. Budd said yes , and agreed to await the arrival of this representative of B4 , the ultra-secret British Intelligencedepartment ,  |p235Lanny  had acquired a great respect for this organization . They had done a perfect job on him , and as a professional he could appreciate it . When their representative was safely ensconced in his room and had started to present apologies , Lanny said : " Not at all , Mr. Fordyce ; you were perfectly correct , on the basis of the evidence you had . You understand , I was not at liberty to reveal to you for whom I was working . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion about it . Also , I could guess that you might be on your way home , anyhow . " Lanny chuckled . " That guess was correct , and you saved me trouble by arranging for my prompt flight . So all is well , and we are friends , I trust . " " Righto ! The Prime Minister has sent us a note , saying that you are to have everything you want . May I say , that is an unusual privilege in these times . " " The Prime Minister has his reasons , which some day I may be free to explain to you . Let me say straight off what I have in mind , and that is , to have a private talk with Rudolf Hess . " " I presume that might be arranged . You understand , he is an importantprisoner of state , and especially guarded . He is a difficult prisoner and has to be treated to some extent as a mental patient . We use great care not to excite him . " " Knowing him well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he thinks of me as his devoted friend and sympathizer , and I wish to continue in that role . If you were to take me to him , he would know at once that I had gone over to your side , and so he would close his mouth , or possibly even break into bitter reproaches . It is my idea to make him think that I am coming to him clandestinely , and without the knowledge of his captors . I should like to have a jailer smuggle me into his room in the dead of night , and I 'll tell Hess that I have paid that jailer , say , a hundred pounds . Hess is used to bribery and corruption himself and would have no difficulty in believing such a story . " " I see what you mean , Mr. Budd , and it seems to me a promising idea . " " You will naturally wish to know what I expect to get from the prisoner . I have no wish to keep matters secret from you , and if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right with me  --  rather better , in fact , because it will save me the task of having to remember what may be a long conversation . Rudi , who is supposed to be so reticent , is really a talkative fellow among his few intimates , and I do n't suppose he has seen any of these in the past year . "  | " Indeed not ; he is kept strictly , but he is fairly well informed as to the outside world , because he is permitted to have a radio set . " " You are indeed treating him well ! " " We are treating him according to his rank in Germany , and of course in strict accord with the Geneva Convention . We could not fail to do this , even if we wished otherwise , because they have many prisonersof ours upon whom they might retaliate . But of course Hess is not satisfied ; he argues that he came as an ambassador and should enjoy diplomatic status ; we consider him a military prisoner , because he is an officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him have had many wrangles with him on this subject . " " That I can imagine ; no doubt I 'll hear about it from him . You must understand that I have been posing as a Nazi sympathizer for many years , and have enjoyed the friendship of Hitler for about fifteen years , and of Hess about five . I can not guess what I may find out from him , or rather , I could guess a great number of things which might or might not come out in our talk . One thing , I ought to be able to learn whether he has ever had any message from Germany or has been able to send one . That I am sure would be of interest to you . " " Indeed yes , Mr. Budd . And there might be one or two other things which we could suggest that you give him a chance to talk about . " The B4 man went on to reveal that the Number Three Nazi had recently been taken to the Maindiff Court Hospital , near the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the accent on the third syllable ; then he explained that it was spelled Abergavenny , with the accent on the fourth syllable . It was in the county of Monmouth , close to the border of Wales , and was an old town ; near it was a twelfth-century Norman castle which appeared to exercise a spell upon the imagination of the unhappy prisoner . He was permitted to drive there , accompanied by an officer of the guard , and with other members of the guard following in the rear . He and his mongrel dog , called Hippo , would lie by the double moat of the ruined castle and watch the ducks on the surface of the water and the two golden carp which dwelt below . " We 'll be happy to motor you there , " said the agreeable agent ; and when Lanny objected that he did n't like to use up any of the nation 's precious petrol , the man said that it would n't take much , only about fifteen gallons , and what they might get out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest of B4 , " he insisted . When Lanny had talked with this middle-aged gentleman a year ago , Fordyce had given the impression of being well filled out ; now he was considerably slimmer , and his cheeks were not so rosy as they had been . That was the case with pretty nearly everybody in besieged London , and some of the people gave the same depressing effect as the ruins of the buildings . Lanny said : " I hope that you will confine discussion of this project to as few persons as possible , for I am still playing a dangerous role , and you know that there are always possibilities of a leak . " " No one knows about it so far except my superior , who got the order directly from the Prime Minister . The only other person who needs to know is the medical superintendent in charge of the hospital . He carries the responsibility for Hess 's welfare , and naturally we could not keep him in ignorance of a matter which will undoubtedly have an effect upon his patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sure . " Lanny assented to that , and added : " Wo n't you also have to tell one or more of the jailers ? " " I do n't see why they need know anything about it . If you are let into Hess 's room in the middle of the night , he will not see who lets you in , and will have to accept what you tell him . It had better be the medical superintendent himself , and then none of the men will question what is going on . " " Fine ! " exclaimed the P.A. He took out his billfold and from it extracted a folded sheet of paper which he opened . " Here is an idea , " he said . " Here are four slips of flimsy . On each I have typed the names Kurvenal-Siegfried . ' The first of these is the name of a character in Wagner 's Tristan , who is described as the truest of the true . ' It is the code name I gave to Hess so that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name that Hitler gave me so that if I had anything to communicate to him I could be sure he would know where it came from . " " You have indeed been playing a difficult game , Mr. Budd . " " I have had special advantages , which were prepared a long time before this war . Now it is my idea to roll each of these slips into a little ball , and get it to Hess in his food . Such a pellet could be pressed into a chunk of bread , or into an apple , or a not-too-soft pudding . He might fail to notice one or two and swallow them ; that is why I should try several times . It might be that he would n't eat that particular chunk of bread , and if so , we could put the pellet into another for the next meal . It would n't do any harm if he got several ; they would all mean one thing to him and one only , that I was on the outside and planning to help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide his excitement , and if this went on for several days , he would be prepared to have me appear in his room in the night , and to believe that I had really been corrupting his guards . We could talk in whispers and with all the atmosphere of melodrama . " " You Americans read detective stories , too ! " was the Englishman 's comment . Lanny replied : " It was Sherlock Holmes who taught us most of what we know on the subject . And let me remind you that I watched the process by which you chaps lured Hess to Britain , and if there was ever a rawer piece of melodrama , I have never come upon it in any of our whodunits . ' " An Englishman 's natural color came hack into the B4 man 's cheeks , and he beamed as he remarked : " It was rather good , we do admit . " He could n't refrain from adding : " Is whodunit ' an American word , Mr. Budd ? We are supposed to keep track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It would pain you to mutilate the language in that fashion , " replied the P.A. with his most amiable smile . Said the Englishman : " I understand that our two armies are now in process of dividing up the burden of learning a new language . They are listing the objects which have different names and are going halfand-halfon them . We are to agree that a spanner is a wrench , and you in turn are to agree that gas is petrol . So we hope to operate without confusion  --  except to the Hun . " The program they agreed upon was that Mr. Fordyce was to drive that afternoon to the town with the abbreviated Welsh name and have a confidential talk with the medical superintendent . If he approved , the pellets would be fed to the patient one each day , and on the evening of the fourth day Lanny would be driven to the place early enough to confer with the superintendent . At midnight he would be escorted to the prisoner 's room , and the guard who always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go outside until summoned again . Lanny said that was all O.K. , and he would spend part of the interim making up his mind what he wanted to say to the prisoner and what he would try to get from him . If Mr. Fordyce had other suggestions , he might give them to Lanny on the drive.  |p239So  it was agreed , and the son of Budd-Erling went back to the job of renewing his acquaintances in London and picking up ideas and information . Rick had given him the address of his elder son , Alfy , who got leave and came to town . Alfy had been taken out of his fighting job and put to training younger flyers ; that had come near to breaking his heart , but now that he was used to it , he had to admit that it was a better employment of his experience . The relief to his parents had n't lasted long , for now his younger brother had been stationed at " Hell 's Corner , " down at the southeast point of this tight little island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , but now was nearly all right again and ready for another go . How different appeared the situation of England since Lanny had last talked with this young , old friend ! Then it had been touch and go ; now Alfy was quietly certain that they had got the Hun down . The new Budd-Erling pursuit plane was tops , as good as even the newest " Spit . " That would tickle Robbie Budd , but unfortunately Lanny had no way to get the word to him until he , Lanny , got back home . The only thing that could change the situation now , said Alfy , was something completely new from the enemy . Lanny warned him about jet propulsion , and this slender , high-strung Englishman said maybe so , such bombs might make a bit of trouble , but before they could be produced in quantity the British would have them , too . " We 're working on them , day and night , let me tell you . " Alfy revealed other secrets of his dangerous trade , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a right to know everything . Blueprints and models and formulas of aerodynamics were all of first-rate importance , but nothing could take the place of actual combat experience , the things that men reported day after day as they came in from meetings with the enemy in which one or the other had to die . Alfy had had two full years of it , in addition to what he had learned in trying to help the Spanish Republic . He was only twentyfive , but had lines of care in his thin , sensitive features and a touch of gray in his hair . He slept very badly , but counted himself lucky to be alive and still to have something to give to his " Mother of the Free . " " We 're going to hold the fort for you , " Alfy declared . And his friend could assure him : " The Yanks are coming ! We 'll put enough weight on this little island to sink it ! " Said the airman with a smile : " We must get more barrage balloons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " When I call you on the telephone , I 'll talk about a golf game . " So , next day , he reported : " I have inspected the golf course and it 's in good condition . I think we can have our round in three days . " Two days later he called again : " Three of the four golf balls have been lost , and I think I know who found them . " Lanny chuckled and said that he would be ready to play off the match on the morrow . At two o'clock the next day Fordyce called for Lanny in one of those smallish Austin cars which were saving much precious petrol for Britain . Lanny , who had long legs , could just get them in . They drove by the road he had always taken to Wickthorpe Castle , and then on , slightly north of west , through Oxford and Gloucester , historic names . The Englishman told about his visit to the hospital and what he had found there . It was a fairly large place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a room at the extreme end of the " female wing , " opening onto a small lawn with iron railings . He was never alone , day or night . He would stroll about the countryside on parole . Being a wealthy man , with money in several banks in neutral countries , he could indulge his whims and was permitted to do so within limits ; he chose to dress himself in a blue sports coat , gray flannel trousers , and flaring yellow boots . " That is n't like the Rudi I knew , " said Lanny . " Then he wore a plain S.A. uniform . " " That was glory in those days , " replied the other . " Now he chooses to be an English country squire  --  but yellow boots rather spoil the effect ! The people of the neighborhood refer to him playfully as the Kaiser of Abergavenny . They are used to the sight of him on the roads , or sitting somewhere in the sunshine ; he will stay for hours painting or sketching . Time hangs heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He is a military student , Mr. Fordyce , and must know that victory for his side is a long way off . No doubt he fights against the realiza-tion . " " He fights against everything and everybody . He frightens the nurses with his scowls . He can not bear to take orders , and while he has never offered physical resistance , he has made it necessary to have a force of thirty men , mostly soldiers of the Welsh regiment , to guard him . I suppose that counts as a military gain for Germany . " They talked for a while about what Lanny might find out . It was ofp241great importance to know if Hess had any way of communicating with the outside , and it would be a master stroke if he could be led to name any confederate or agent in Britain . It was entirely likely that the Nazis , who had apparently foreseen everything , had established a systemfor meeting just such contingencies as now confronted their Nummer Drei . B4 would have paid a small fortune for the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were winding through the hills of Monmouthshire , with its tree-shrouded country lanes and gray stone cottages . In the fields the old men , the women , and the children worked from dawn to dark , growing food for the workers and the soldiers . They came to the town of Ross , and then by the " old road " to the small town of Abergavenny . " Aber " is Celtic for " mouth of , " referring to a stream ; there was an Abertillery and an Abersycha and others in the neighborhood . They were only a short drive from the great softcoalcenters of South Wales , where the miners were toiling long hours to provide fuel for the making of guns and shells . To the south lay the harbors of Swansea and Bristol , now crowded with war shipping . They drove to the hospital , a modern building beautifully set among shade trees . The guards knew the B4 man and passed him and his guest without questioning . Lanny was taken to the home of the medical superintendent and whisked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was in his early forties , rather tall , smooth-shaven , and wore horn-rimmed glasses . He had the rank of major in the British Army . Major Jones explained the peculiar responsibility which Rudolf Hess represented to his custodians . If Hess were to die , the Nazis would be certain to claim that it was the result of mistreatment , and they might take the lives of hundreds of the British officers whom they had at their mercy . Therefore the hospital was scrupulous in welcoming the Swiss Neutrality Commission which was charged with enforcing the Geneva Convention . They came whenever they wished and talked with the prisoner and made sure that he had everything to which he was entitled . Because of the fear that he might commit suicide in spite of the utmost watchfulness , the guardians babied him considerably , allowinghim harmless little indulgences which were surely not in the convention . " As a rule he does n't have much appetite , and he has lost weight in spite of our best efforts . " Said Lanny : " I can understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to imagine that he would want to live if the Nazi cause goes down . " " That is what we fear , Mr. Budd , and why we have to be so careful in handling him . He is liable to fits of depression which may last for weeks . " " You need not fear any result of that sort from my visit , Major . It has always been my role with the Nazis to be optimistic and admiring  --  that is how I have got them to trust me and to talk . You may be sure that your patient will have hope after our meeting . Of course , he will have disappointments later , but that is inevitable  --  since I am assuming that his cause will fail . " " It 's damn well going to fail , " said the medical man . He added that he thought Hess must have received at least one of the code messages , for he had shown signs of restlessness during the past two or three days . Of course he would not speak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They discussed the program to be followed . There was no need to wait until midnight , for in order to save electricity they all went to bed with the chickens . After ten o'clock everything was as quiet as could be , and the Major would take Mr. Budd to the prisoner 's bedroom and slip him inside without a sound . At the same time the guard who sat in the dimly lighted room all night would move out , as he always did when the Major entered . That was all . The two secret agents drove to an inconspicuous inn and had supper , and then , since there was time to be passed , they paid a visit to the ancient Norman ruin called Whitecastle , of which Hess was so fond . He was n't there now , so they got out and strolled around , and Lanny saw the ducks , and one of the two golden carp . A woman custodian showed them about . They climbed the well-worn stairs and inspected the defenses of the castle , which included many slits for bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the maximum field of vision . " Herr Hess was greatly interested in this , " remarked the custodian . Later they sat by the double moat and watched the twilight settle over the beautiful scene . Fordyce told the inside story of how he and his fellow agents had lured Hess to England by getting up a conspiracy of pretended Nazi sympathizers . Lanny told how puzzled he had been when Hess had revealed this conspiracy to him , and for some time Lanny had been unable to decide whether or not it was real . He told stories about the secretary and disciple of the Nazi Fiihrer who had risen to become a Reichsminister and party chief ; about the countryp243home he had maintained near Berlin , and Klara , the lean and by-no -- means seductive lady he had married . She believed in psychic phenomenaeven more ardently than her husband , and had discoursed learnedly to Lanny about the mystical books of ancient India . Promptly at ten they returned to the hospital grounds . Lanny sat in the car until Major Jones came out and led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where the prisoner lived his strange solitary life . The medical man carried a small instrument case and requested Lanny to carry it into the room and out again ; the guards were being told that he was making some observations of the prisoner during his sleep . The Major apparently had complete authority ; he spoke a whisperedword to the two soldiers at the door , and to the one who sat at the door of Hess 's bedroom . The Major opened the door  --  it had no knob on the inside , so he had told Lanny . The latter stepped quietly in , and then moved out of the way of the man who had sat on duty inside , and who rose immediately and came to the open door and out . Lanny stood in silence , looking about the room , which was plain , as became a hospital . There was a dim light burning , well shaded . There was a chest of drawers and a couple of chairs ; by the starlight outside Lanny could see that the windows were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man wearing striped pajamas . Lanny waited until the door had been closed , then he stepped softly to the bedside and whispered : " Rudi . " Evidently the man had not been asleep . He sat up instantly . " Is it really you , Lanny ? " he whispered . " Yes , Rudi . You got my messages ? " " I got one , but could hardly believe it . " There was a chair by the bedside and Lanny slipped into it . The rest of the conversation was carried on in the lowest audible whispers ; in English , which Hess knew as well as German , having been born in Alexandria and educated there . " Lanny , " he said in a tone of great stress , " have you turned against us ? " The P.A. was prepared for the question , and put pain into his reply . " Can you ask me that , Rudi , after all these years ? " " But how can you be admitted here ? " " That is a long story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid in cash this night . "  | " Herrgott ! They are that venal ? " " A nation of shopkeepers , Rudi . " " Who has taken it ? " " I had to give my word not to tell . Suffice it that the right man got the money . It has taken me three weeks of making friends before I could drop a hint of what I wanted . " " And what do you want from me ? " " First of all , to see you , and to hear your voice . To let you know that you still have friends . How are they treating you ? " " Well enough , so far as food and shelter are concerned . But it is an outrage that I should be a prisoner . I came here in good faith , as a diplomatic representative . I am convinced now that I was trapped . " " I believe the same thing ; but I did not find it out until it was too late . Did you get my messages ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorily . " " There it is ! We can not depend upon anybody ! I sent you detailed accounts of my talks with the persons you had told me about . There was a man who gave me the name of Branscome , but I could never feel sure which side he was on . It has been very difficult for me to work in England . " " I ca n't see how you manage to do it ! " " I use my father 's influence . I am supposed to be helping him . He used to be on our side , you know , until our government offered him so much money . " " American money is making it very hard for us , Lanny . Everything is going the way I feared and tried my best to prevent . " " You are not getting discouraged , I hope , lieber Rudi . Your armies hold all the vital points in Europe , and it would take decades of fightingto expel them . " " Do you really believe that ? I try hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory that will count in the long run , it will be air power , and you are building more of it . " " Do n't say me , Rudi , say American big business . I have never been their man , not even in my boyhood . " " You are a true friend , Lanny , and I believe what you tell me . Have you been in Germany since you saw me last ? " " No , I have been crippled ; I was in a plane wreck and had both legs broken . I have only recently been able to get about freely , and my first thought was of you . Tell me , is there anything I can do for you ? " " I do n't know what it could be  --  unless you could figure out a way for me to escape . "  | " Believe me , I have been thinking about it day and night . There are many circumstances which might favor the plan . In Newport there is a large camp for German war prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could get into touch with them and tell them where you are and how you are guarded . " " But what could they do in England , Lanny ? The whole countrysidewould be up and after them . " " The action would have to be co-ordinated with what the British call a commando raid , say from Cherbourg . Later , when the nights are longer , there will be time for speedboats to come and go in the darkness . Parachutists might be dropped at this place , and bring you out , and the two forces might meet . " " That is possible , I suppose ; but what could keep the British Navy from getting us on the return trip ? They swarm in the Channel and claim it as their own . " " That would be a job for your airplanes . Surely they could provide a cover for the three or four hours it would take speedboats to get back to the French coast . Think what a colossal prestige stroke it would be to take you out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be in any doubt about that ! " " Yes , Lanny , but it would not have much military effect , and I am afraid that is what he is forced to concentrate on at present . I would fear to burden his mind and distract his attention for my benefit . " Lanny 's eyes , growing used to the faint light , roamed over the features of this man leaning from the bed and not more than two feet away from him . A strange square face , with a stern mouth that made a straight line , and bushy black eyebrows making another . Lanny had known him at the height of his glory , a grim , implacable man in the service of his cause , but genial enough with the few friends he trusted , and oddly credulous when it came to the mysterious underworld of the " spirits . " Now he was thinner ; the bones stood out in his face , and the black hair was growing sparse . He suffered from gastritis ; it might be due to British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that his hands trembled when he made a gesture ; he was obviously moved by this visitation out of his triumphant past . " Listen , Rudi , " began the solicitous friend . " You are n't by chance worrying over the idea that the Fiihrer may have misunderstood your flight to Britain ! "  | " No , I am sure he knows me too well for that ; he knows that I could never have any thought but to help him . All that troubles me is that I failed . It was an enterprise that had to succeed , or it was nothing . " " We can all fail , lieber Freund . Even the Fiihrer has failed more than once . He has n't been able to invade England , and he was n't able to take Moscow last autumn . " " Yes , Lanny , but that is a cold sort of comfort . What tortures me is the bombing of our beautiful German cities , and the awful slaughter of our best youth . Day after day I listen to news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers and radio lie , I can not suppose they invent whole campaigns . " " It is dreadful , and I share your heartache . I am troubled by the thought of your loneliness . Do you have no communications from the outside ? " " They permit me to receive letters from Klara , but of course if she said anything about political or military matters they would cut it out . There is not much else to say nowadays . " " You mean that you have not been able to get any communication from the Fiihrer ? " " Not a word . I am far too carefully watched , and I have not the large sums of money that it would require to bribe anybody . " " It is dreadful that you should be so neglected , Rudi ! Surely there must be many agents in this country ! " " Yes , but they have more important matters to work on than to bring birthday greetings to a prisoner of war . " " It is worse than I imagined . Would you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would indeed . " " I was able to have Switzerland included in my passport . As you know , my mother lives in Unoccupied France , so that I have a good pretext for a trip . If I were to get word to the Fiihrer that I had a message from you , he would surely send somebody to get it . " " He would do more than that ; he would make it possible for you to come to him , if you were willing to take the risk of having the fact leak out . " " I can not think of anything that would please me more . It might be that I could bring out some message to his friends abroad which would help to terminate this blind and cruel fratricide . " " I am afraid he has few friends in the so-called democracies now , Lanny. "  | " Many more than you think , take my word for that . But tell me , what message do you wish to send ? " " Tell him first of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never wavered for one moment in that , and never shall . " " And what else ? " " I should have to think , Lanny . I am quite overwhelmed by the idea of being able to send word to him . I think of so many things that ought to be done , and that I might suggest to him if we could speak , but none that is important enough to send as a message . Quote him the English saying that the darkest hour is just before the dawn . Remind him of the glorious example of Frederick the Great , who was beaten more than once but refused to recognize it . Tell him that I lie here in the solitude and darkness and try to send him courage and hope by the secret channels of the subconscious . " " He will be deeply touched , Rudi , as I am . You have no concrete news of any sort for him ? " " What can a poor wretch in what is practically solitary confinement have to tell ? Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for him to bring me deliverance . And of course if he can send me help without too great risk of loss to the Fatherland , I will do what I can to fight my way out . " Lanny kept on giving leads and hints until he satisfied himself that he was n't going to get any information of importance from this NumberThree Nazi ; either the Nazi did n't have it , or he was no longer trusting his American friend . Lanny had had no part in the scheme of B4 to lure Hess to Britain , but Hess , brooding over the matter in his too abundant leisure , was likely to have hit upon the possibility that Lanny might have been in on the plot . Or he might have decided that all Americans were enemies now . Anyhow , what he wanted was to get information , not to give . He wanted to ask about Lord Wickthorpe and others who were supposed to sympathize with his cause , and after that he wanted to tell his troubles , to repeat the complaints he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had visited him not long ago . Lanny decided that the once vigorous master of the N.S.D.A.P.  --  National Socialist German Workers ' Party  --  had become a querulous neurotic and a bore . He said : " Rudi , I am allowed only one hour here ,  | and I promised not to overstay . Tell me frankly , do you want me to see the Fiihrer for you ? " " Of course , Lanny . " " Well then , give me something to prove to the Fiihrer that I was here . I hardly need to point out that he will not trust anyone from my part of the world . " Lanny took from his coat pocket a small writing pad and pencil . " Will you write me a few words for him ? " When Hess said " Surely , " Lanny went on : " Write it as small as you can , in one corner of the paper , so that I can cut it off and conceal it in my clothing . If it were found , I should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hess wrote a few words in one corner of the paper . " This wo n't look much like my handwriting , written so small , " he commented . " Is there some talisman you could give me ? Something the Fiihrer would know ? " " I will give you my wedding ring . " Hess took from his finger a plain gold band . " The Fiihrer gave me this , and he will remember the inscription . To make it more sure , repeat to him what he told me when he put it into my hand : Dies wird des Lastertnaul zuzn Schweigen bringers ! ' " Lanny knew what that referred to . In the old days of political strife the enemies of the Party had accused Adolf Hitler of improper intimacywith his devoted secretary , and they had had a nickname for the secretary , Das Fraulein . The story had it that Hitler therefore had ordered Hess to marry his Klara . " This will shut the mouths of the scandalmongers ! " Lanny took the ring . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I will put it into the Fiihrer 's hands , and when the victory has been won , he will return it to you . And now , Lebewohl ! Take care of yourself , and keep up your courage . Every moment you give to doubt and worry is a moment wasted . Remember what Goethe said : Alles in der Welt liisst sich ertragen . ' " They exchanged a firm handclasp , and Lanny picked up the Major 's little bag and went to the door of the room and tapped gently upon it . Almost at once it opened , and Lanny stepped out and a guard stepped in . Lanny left the bungalow and walked to the Major 's residence , in front of which Fordyce was waiting with the car ; the B4 man offered to take the bag inside , which Lanny understood to mean that he was n't expected to make any report there . " Tell him that everything went off well , " said the P.A. , and that was enough.  |p249They  decided to drive home that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complete except that he said nothing about the scrap of writing and the ring . If B4 had had a recording device installed in the room there would be no harm done , but otherwiseLanny would keep that secret . He said he was sorry that he had n't been able to get anything more important out of the prisoner . His guess was that Rudi had been telling the truth , that he did n't have any contacts with the outside world . The agent professed himself well pleased , but in his heart he must have been disappointed , for if he had helped to uncover a conspiracy it would have been a bright feather in his cap . Churchill had suggested to Lanny that he would be interested to hear the outcome of the talk with Hess . But now Lanny told the agent : " I am guessing that I did n't get enough to make it worth the Prime Minister 's while . Will you tell him , or shall I ? " " My senior will report to him , " replied Fordyce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have no doubt of that , " said the other . " I understand that importantdecisions are being taken . " That was as near as either of them would come to mentioning the fact that the top-flight American staff officers , the commanders of the Army , the Navy , and the Air Forces , had been flown to Britain a week or so previously . When they got to London , Lanny bade good-by to his escort and went to his hotel room . There he took out the pad of paper . He read the fine script : " Mein Fuhrer : Ich bin es . Rudi . " Literally translated the sentence means " I am it , " but in English the words are reversed , and people say " It is I , " or more commonly , " It 's me , " against which the grammarians fight in vain . Lanny took his nail scissors and cut off the bit of paper , about two square inches ; he folded it once , and carefullysewed it into the lining of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card . He put the ring on his finger  --  he , too , being a married man . It was his idea to go hack to America soon and use these magical objects  --  the Ring and the Tarnhelm !  --  to persuade F.D.R. to let him go into Germany again . The news of the military conference then going on was a closely warded secret ; but the newspapermen knew it , even though they could not give the least hint of it in print . Rick had told Lanny that the party included General Marshall , Chief of Staff , and Admiral King . Already in London was the newly appointed Commanding General of the American forces in the European Theater , whose name was Eisenhower . Lanny had never heard this name until the appointment was announced ; he had to take it for granted that F.D.R. and his advisers knew their man . " General Ike " had set up headquarters in some " flats " in Grosvenor Square , one of the fashionable districts of London , and the playful Americans had taken to calling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke of fate that the new " C.G. " should be of German ancestry and carry a German name . The words mean " iron hewer , " and the word " iron " has been through the centuries a favorite of all military-minded German poets and orators . Now a hewer from the prairie state of Kansas had come to hew the German iron , beginning with the " blood and iron " of Bismarck and including the " iron soul " of Adolf Hitler . Among the arrivals from Washington was Mr. Harry Hopkins , with the Army physician who labored to keep him alive through the strain of eighteen-hour-a-day conferring . The party had put up at the Dorchester , which was why Lanny had n't been able to obtain a room there and had gone to the Savoy . After the trip to Abergavenny Lanny got some sleep , and then he called the Dorchester and asked for Mr. Hopkins 's secretary . To that functionary he pronounced the magic word " Traveler , " which had been given to Hopkins . It had the same effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . " Are you going to be in town for the next three or four days ? " he inquired , and Lanny answered that he had meant to spend the time with his little daughter at Wickthorpe Castle , but would come to town in response to either a telegram or telephone call . " Fine ! " said Hopkins . " You 'll hear from me . " Lanny called Rick , and they took a bus out to Hampstead Heath , and strolled by the ponds near the Vale of Health , where John Keats had lived ; and then on to the ancient Spaniard 's Inn , haunt of many poets . They had dinner in a place where no one knew them , and then sat out on the heath , discussing the future of the world , now being decided in town . Rick had attended a press conference given by the " C.G. , " and reported him a straightforward and democratic fellow , a beneficent example to the brass hats of Britain . " The only thing is , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't worry , " Lanny assured him . " Our fellows are really going top251fight . I am told that our maneuvers in the Louisiana marshes were quite terrific . " " I know , " agreed Rick . " They are drilling like all-possessed in North Ireland and practicing landings all round our coast . The Germans send in a tip-and-run plane now and then and get photographs . They ca n't find them very reassuring . " Lanny could n't say " Roosevelt told me , " but he could say : " I am told that Roosevelt is determined that American forces shall go into action somewhere this year . If it 's not to be across the Channel , then it must be the Mediterranean , or we 'll change our plans and concentrate first upon the Japanese . I do n't suppose your people want that . " " Hardly , " said the baronet 's son . " But from all I hear Winnie is dead set against any more Channel crossings until we have overwhelming forces . So I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the better it will suit our Tory leader . If he could invade through the Balkans he would consider that he was killing two birds with one stone , winning two wars with one expedition . " " The Second World War and the Third , " replied Lanny with a smile . They did n't need to say more , for they had both been in Paris early in the year 1919 when the descendant of the Duke of Marlboroughhad come there and labored mightily to persuade the Allies to undertake a holy crusade to crush the cockatrice of Bolshevism , just emerged from its egg and not yet having had time to develop its poison fangs . " Winnie has n't had a new idea in a quarter of a century , " said the " Pink " journalist . " He would n't get another in the next quarter of a millennium . " Lanny thought that was extreme , and replied , " He was a consistent supporter of the League of Nations , and of collective security . " Lanny took an evening train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elderly dragon lady who had once been his mother-in-law and now was his co-parent , so to speak  --  he an ordinary parent and she a grand one . She was a grand lady in her own estimation , also in physical aspect . Lanny had no doubt that in her secret heart she disliked him ; how could she have any other attitude to a man who had failed to appreciate the magnificent Irma and the equally magnificent Barnes fortune ? But he had over her a terrible power ; at any time he might choose to take the little Frances away for a holiday ,  | even to America , and if he chose to keep her there , who could guess what the law might say about it ? The result was that Fanny Barnes the haughty was polite to the point of obsequiousness . Lanny 's room in her cottage was kept inviolate , and the place was silent while he slept or read or pecked on his typewriter . Poor old Uncle Horace , ex-manipulator of Wall Street securities , was rudely forbidden to bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a bridge four , but left it for him to confer that favor if he chose . So Lanny lived a life of ease , roamed the estate , played tennis and bowls with the little one , played the piano for her , and danced with her to the music of radio or phonograph . They lunched with the grandmother , and dined at the Castle with mother and stepfather and whateverguests might be on hand . The child was old enough for that now ; she was perfectly behaved ; her mother was a strict disciplinarian , and Lanny could find no fault with the upbringing of a future heiress and bride of some British nobleman . He would have liked to teach her some of his ideas , but his role forbade that . He could only hope that events might do it for him . He lived this elegant and expensive life , in which even the play was formalized , and all the time he was thinking : " The future of the world is being decided ! " Not a line about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you could n't have dreamed that the directing brains of the American Armed Forces were in London . But the Earl of Wickthorpeand his countess knew it , and imparted it to Lanny as a state secret , and he was duly grateful for the favor . The guests speculated as to the probable decisions , and of course they expected to hear what a much-traveled art expert thought . Lanny could make a good guess , and did so , for it was important to him to keep the respect of the " Wickthorpe set . " He might have need of it again ! Early on the morning of the twenty-fifth of July there came a telegram reading : " Can see you this afternoon . Urgent . Harry . " So Lanny bade farewell to this life of a country gentleman , and to his dear little daughter , who could not be told why her father had to leave so soon and never knew when he would return . Always a new heartache , wherever he was , in Connecticut or New York , in Buckinghamshireor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain in a few days , but all he could say was : " I 'll write you , darling ; and I 'll come back as soon as I can . "  |p253The  President 's right-hand man , clad in a pair of shorts on a hot sunnier afternoon , looked like a very sick man indeed ; but apparently he had learned to live with his diseases , and they did not inhibit his cheerful manner . He offered his visitor a drink , and when it was declined , remarked : " I am on a , schedule , too . " Then : " Excuse me if I stretch out , " and let himself down on the bed . He signed Lanny to a chair alongside . " You wo n't mind if I come right to the point , Lanny . These have been strenuous days for all of us . " " Indeed , I am surprised that you remembered me . " " The Boss told me to remember you . This is the result of the conference . The British refused positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say we could n't force the Germans to divert anything from Russia , because the Germans have enough forces in France to withstand anything we could put ashore this year . And another defeat would be a catastrophe . " " That 's about what you expected , is n't it ? " " Yes , but we had hopes . Now we have to change all our plans . It 's to be the Mediterranean . Churchill , of course , wants it to be the Balkans ; he fought like a tiger for that . You should have been there  --  it was quite a drama . The first time he saw me he gave me the devil because I had talked to some of the generals before I talked to him . That 's not protocol , it seems . He gave me to understand that he was the master of the British Empire , and that he , not any of the generals , is running the British part of this war . He grabbed the law book in which this is written and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were making a speech in Parliament ; when he finished each passage he ripped the page out of the book and threw it on the floor . A good show , as they say . " " I hope you stood up to him , Harry , " ventured the P.A.The harnessmaker 's son looked intently at his visitor . " Listen , brother , " he said . " You are a plutocrat , I take it , and Churchill is an aristocrat ; I 'm only a democrat , and with a small d . ' But I had to learn to stand up to our business tycoons in the old W.P.A. days , and even before that , in Albany . They want the earth with a blue ribbon tied round it , and when they ca n't have it they roar you down . The Boss told me to talk back to Churchill from the beginning , and I did , and he took it like a good sport . "  | " There is a thing that he calls lease-lend , ' " remarked Lanny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not in this case . We ca n't go it alone , or even threaten to . We agreed to compromise . We gave up the Channel and the P.M. gave up the Balkans . We 're going to invade through French North Africa and put Rommel into a sack . " " Oh , good ! That 's been my hope from the beginning . " " You understand , this is top secret , and for your own use only . " " The Governor seemed to mean that I would be free to share it with one or two persons who are working on the spot . " " If he said that , it goes , of course . But be sure they are persons you can trust to the death . You know what it means to be caught spying on the Nazis . " " Indeed I know . I have visited their dungeons ; and Goring once put me in one . It was his idea of a joke , but I got all the feelings .

We may take Dakar or Casablanca on the Atlantic , or Oran or Algiers on the Mediterranean . We leave the enemy to guess . Between you and me , it will be all , or most of , those ports . " " I see . And the time ? " " Nobody knows the time yet . We have to change a million details , and it depends on when we can be ready . But it will be this year  --  that is the agreement . You will be going there immediately ? " " Vichy is my first goal . " " You have transportation arranged ? " " I have to cable Baker . " " That is not necessary . Let me attend to it for you .

I have commissions to buy paintings in Vichy France , also a very fine fountain for ablutions in Algeria . " " Harry the Hop " broke into a grin . He started to get up , but Lanny saw that it was an effort and said : " Stay where you are . Thanks , as ever . "  | " I have to get up . Our train is leaving tonight . You may be interested to know that I am flying back to Washington to be married in the White House . " " You do n't say ! Congratulations ! " " I have found a woman who is willing to take care of these tired bones . I understand that you have recently been married also . Good luck to you and yours , old man . " They exchanged a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing well that they might never see each other again . Very often they did n't , and then they were not supposed to wreck themselves with grief . As Goethe had said more than a century ago : " Everything on the earth can be endured . " Lanny had quoted it to Hess . L I S B O N was still in its safe berth by the River Tagus , and still pleasanter from the air than from the ground . Portugal was making money out of both sides in the war , and , as always , the rich were adding to their hoards while the poor discovered the meaning of inflationand that wages never kept up with the stealthy increase in the cost of food . The city was so full of spies that they tried to work on one another , and , of course , the arrival of an American art expert via London was not overlooked . Lanny was glad that he had to spend only a few hours telling ladies and gentlemen with assorted foreign accents that he was an esthete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , that he never lent money , no matter how sad the story . In Madrid he had to stay over until the next day , and he did n't mind that , for he could spend the evening at the home of his elderly friend General Aguilar , and be internally drenched with copitas de manzanillainEnglish , cups of camomile tea . This white-whiskered old aristocrat with the many medals , which he wore even at home , was one of the few Spanish Fascists who were interested in the outside world and made a pretense of culture  --  meaning , of course , the kind that cost money and was elegant and exclusive . He listened with interest to Lanny 's account of the wonderful art collection which Reichsmarschall Goring was assembling in Germany . " A man out of the old times ! " he exclaimed admiringly , and went on to reveal the fact that a year or two ago this conquistador had assembled more than three hundred of the largest guns ever made in the world , with the intention of taking Gibraltar . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spain , which was supposed to be a neutral country , and that they were aimed at the property of Britain , which was supposed to be a friendly country , troubled the military commander of Madrid so little that he did n't mention it and probably did n't think of it . " I suppose those guns have been taken to the eastern front now , " remarked the art expert casually . " No , they are still there , " said the General , who was in a mellow mood , having listened to much flattery . " They serve a useful purpose in protecting the neutrality of Morocco . " He did n't say Spanish Morocco , but Lanny knew he meant that ; he was refusing to acknowledge the existence of French Morocco . " Do you mean , " asked the American , " the guns are powerful enough to be effective across the Strait ? " " They might be ; but I mean that our ability to take Gibraltar will exercise a restraining influence upon hostile forces that might wish to land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of such expeditions , " remarked Lanny , " but of course a civilian never knows whether it is something real or just a smoke screen . From what I can gather , the most likely place for a landingappears to be the Vardar valley in Greece . " Said the Spaniard : " It is a never-ending source of wonder to me , how you Americans continue to let yourselves be persuaded to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the British . " " I do n't think it is going to go on much longer , my General . There are signs of an awakening . Just before I left New York I had a part in the founding of a new organization called the American Christian League . I was amazed by the extent of the public response . " Lanny reached into his pocket and took out one of the leaflets which he had taken off Hartley 's desk . The Red Nightmare  --  he translated , Le Cauchemar Rouge , for they were speaking French . The document suited the old General 's ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money that had been collected and the mass meetings that hadp257been held . In return he talked freely about the " Blue Division , " which represented the first installment of El Caudillo 's promised million men to help the Fuhrer put down the Red demon . These " Blues " were volunteers , in the same sense that the Germans and Italians who had come to fight in Spain had been  --  that is , they could volunteer or be shot . They had been meeting with heavy losses in Russia , but now the Axis armies were advancing rapidly toward the oil of the Caucasus , and it looked as if the dawn were breaking at last . Too had this victory could not have been won by Christian armies , instead of by the Nazis , who were not exactly cordial to Holy Mother Church ! But Marshal Petain had the word of the Fuhrer that the Church would be restored in France as a bulwark against the Reds . They talked about the old Marshal for a while ; Aguilar had come to know him intimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of the Sitzkrieg , before the German invasion of France . The fact that Lanny had been received by Petain here at that time , and had been able to visit him in Vichy , was one of the reasons that the commandant of the Madrid district trusted him completelyand talked to him freely . Lanny was n't a Catholic and could n't pose as one , but he could cite the names of wealthy Americans who recognized the Hierarchy as the chief means of holding down the labor unions and keeping the Reds and the Pinks out of power . Lanny had discussed this subject with Mr. Hearst and Mr. Henry Ford , and what these great men had said on the subject was heard gladly by generalsand admirals as well as cardinals and archbishops throughout Europe . In Vichy a free-spending American was an old friend by now . A landlord would vacate his own room for him , and maitres-d'hotel would greet him by name . He could look up important ministers of state and tell them what their friends in Washington and London and North Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of his travels . To M. Benoist-Mechin and others of his set Lanny could explain that the present depreciation of the franc offered unusual opportunities to do business in old masters . American collectorswere attracted by the prices which Lanny reported to them ; and while this would represent a loss to French culture , the French might consent to look at it from the international point of view and be willingto assist in uplifting the American hinterland . When the matter wasp258put thus tactfully , any statesman could agree , and would tell friends who needed ready cash , and Lanny would be invited to inspect art works in elegant country villas ; mostly they were third-rate , but it cost him nothing to say : " Very interesting , and I 'll be happy to report it to my clients . " Meantime he invited important persons to lunch or dine , and was invited to soirees where the elite of this miserable government displayed their shoddy splendor . " A banana republic without any bananas , " some wit had called it , and yet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Intrigue , jealousy , and hatred appeared to be staple foods at Vichy buffets . Lanny had never been in any place where secrets were so ill kept ; you could hear all the crimes of all the world , except of the person who was talking to you , and you might hear about him from any of his associates . Bourgeois France was falling to pieces , and Vichy was the garbage can . First of all Lanny sought out his friend Chariot de Bruyne . Here was one man who still believed in his creed and was willing to make sacrificesfor it . Lanny felt pity for him and would have liked to say : " Wake up , jeune bonnie ! You are in the middle of the twentieth century , not the eighteenth . " But of course he could n't speak such words ; he had to go on with his role of superspy , which he had not chosen , but which had chosen him . What he did , the first thing , was to tell Chariot about his older brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an officer , and he had received Chariot 's messages of love with the same affection that had prompted them . " But so far as concerns his political opinions , I 'm afraid there 's nothing to be done , Chariot . I argued with him , but it was useless ; he is not to be moved from what he believes . " " What does he believe , Lanny ? " " He believes that General de Gaulle is a great man , a prophet and all that sort of thing . And of course it 's a very dangerous opinion for an officer to hold ; it wo n't further his career. , All we can do is to recognize the fact that he is sincere , and respect him for it . " But the younger brother could n't leave it there . The times were too critical , the feelings too intense . Men were killing each other , and not even brothers could be spared . Lanny had to take refuge in his ivory tower , the stairs of which were getting badly worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Chariot , you must n't expect an American to take part in French politics . " " But your President is doing just that , Lanny ! He made a radio speech in the French language , denouncing our present government ! "  | " It was in very crude schoolboy French , Chariot , and can hardly have made any impression on your intelligent public . Do n't blame this old friend for anything that any politician does . Let me stay au-dessus de la melee , and continue to work at my profession . " Lanny asked about Chariot himself and what he was doing . He was working hard at organizing and training his Legion Tricolore , for the purpose of repressing the traitor enemies here in France ; they were expectingan Allied landing somewhere and planning to aid it , and Charlotwas planning to put them down  --  yes , even if it proved to be his own brother ! There was no keeping away from subject of Denis , and Lanny saw that there could n't be any peace or reconciliation between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed his practice of not seeking out the higher-ups but letting them seek him . This increased his importance and at the same time laid him less open to suspicion . What Lanny did was to tell Monsieur le Ministre Jacques Benoist-Mechin that he had recently come from New York , where he had been instrumental in organizing the American Christian League , and what great encouragement this group would offer to Christian France . Later on , he asked after the health of Admiral Darlan , and expressed his great admiration for that sailor-statesman , knowing that Benoist-Mechin was the Admiral 's man , or had been until lately . The next time Lanny met the ex-journalist he was told that the Admiral had expressed the hope of seeing M. Budd before he departed . Lanny telephoned promptly and an appointment was made . What did this pipe-smoking Commander of the French Fleet want of an American dilettante and playboy grown up ? First , to offer him some of his favorite Pernod Fils brandy ; then to chat politely , asking about the visitor 's mother and father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then to state how deeply he had been hurt by the Americanattitude toward Unoccupied France since the formation of the Laval government . He wanted Lanny to tell his father and his influentialfriends how Frenchmen had been compelled to choose between Red anarchy and White law and order . Also , he had felt his personal honor impugned by the suspicion , so generally expressed in America , that he , Commander of the French Fleet , might somehow be persuadedor intimidated into letting that Fleet come into the possession of the Germans . " Jamais , jamais , jamais ! " exclaimed Jean Louis Xavier Francois Darlan , and he said it several times more in his discourse . It just was n't going to happen . But of course if the Americans should be so misguided as to put troops ashore upon the soil of France , ' the French would have no choice but to defend their patrie and their honneur . Did Lanny think the Americans were preparing to do this ? The Frenchman had heard rumors and was greatly worried . Lanny said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell you . I hear this and hear that , and I wonder , does anybody really know ? This I can tell you : My father expects it will be Salonika and the Vardar River . He talks learnedly about reaching the Germans in their unarmored back , and I get the impression that he has got it from some of the military men who come to Newcastle to supervise the fabricating of fighter planes . I can tell you only of my sincere hope that none of those planes will ever be flying over French soil . " " The British have flown over it , as you know . They recently bombed the Renault plant , near Paris , and I think the bitterest experienceof my life has been the discovery that there are Frenchmen depravedenough to have rejoiced in that bombing , and to welcome the murder of their fellow citizens . " " I have never met any such , mon Amiral , but I have heard that it is so . I am told there are clandestine papers being published and circulated , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true at the time , but it did n't remain true . That very evening , strolling to his room after a soiree , Lanny was passed on a dark street by a man wearing the blouse and cap of a workingman . This man put out a hand to him , saying : " Pour la France ! " Lanny saw that he had a leaflet and took it automatically . He had n't far to go , so he ventured to keep it till he got to his room , and to read it by the dim light that was permitted . A leaflet , entitled Le Temoignage Chretien  --  The Christian Witness  --  it gave the text of a manifesto issued by a group of Catholic priests and Protestant pastors who had come togetherto protest against Fascism and Nazism in the name of freedom and the dignity of the individual human soul . This discovery warmed Lanny 's heart , for he knew that there was another side to Christianity than the defense of capitalist property rights , and he was glad to know that there were humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hierarchy . He mentioned this leaflet in the report to his Chief , which he wrote and sent through the Embassy.  |p261Darlan  was important because he commanded the Fleet , and the Fleet might command the Mediterranean . Of second importance was Pierre Laval , who would hardly have dared to interfere with the Admiral . He , the fripon mongol , commanded the Army ; but if the Allies could keep their hold on the Mediterranean they could deal with whateverarmy the Germans had allowed to the French in North Africa . With the Premier , Lanny pursued the same waiting tactics ; an Americanart expert went about his business , while the word spread among members of the government that he had been to London and met the " Wickthorpe set , " and to New York , where he had founded a powerfulnew organization in support of the Axis . Just as he was making his plans to leave , there came to his humble lodgings one of the Premier 's undersecretaries , bidding him welcome to Vichy and saying that the Premier would be pleased if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation was a command , and Lanny said it was also a pleasure . He took an ancient horse-drawn cab  --  taxis being nonexistent  --  and drove to the Hotel du Parc , where the Mongolian rascal had the royal suite . It was , Lanny thought , the hottest day he had ever known in France , and he found the head of the state in his undershirt amid the best French gilt and rococo . The visitor was invited to take off his coat , and did so , hanging it carefully on the back of his chair and never forgetting it . There were two treasureshidden in it , one of which would have lifted him to glory , and the other of which might have caused him to be hanged . The son of Budd-Erling was n't going to be taken out to Chateldon this trip ; relations with his country were too bad , and it would n't do for the head of the State to exhibit too much intimacy with an American . But in the privacy of his office was another matter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budd-Erling were an ambassador , able to swing the destiny of nations . Pierre Laval said that he was desolated by the situation between the two countries , and by the blind , unreasoning prejudice which President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull showed to his harmless self . He said that he was firmly resolved never to break relations with America ; if that calamity occurred , it would be Washington 's act , not his . Having said this , Pierre proceeded to " fish . " What was Lanny 's own attitude in the present calamitous situation ? Surely he could not have weakened in his abhorrence of the Red Terrorists ! When Lanny said that he was the same friend of order and property rights that he had always been , Pierre appealed to him as a personal friend to tell him what he knew about the mechancete which the Allies were preparing to inflict upon Europe . Lanny in reply explained that he was not well informed , for the reason that the ruling people in America knew his sentiments , and the only place where he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion seemed to be that the Allies were planning an invasion through the Vardar valley . " A safe distance from France , " he commented . " Vraiment , " said the Premier , " mais queue ivresse ! They really imaginethey can conquer the whole of Europe ? They will make a shamblesof it , and what they leave the Reds will finish ! " " Perfectly true , cher Maitre . The only question is whether our peoplecan be awakened in time . " " Look at the situation , M. Budd ! The Germans are almost at the Volga and the Caspian Sea . When they have reached those goals they will have cut Russia in half , and will stop her oil supply and bring all her machinery to a halt . And Rommel is at the gates of Alexandria and Suez , and then of what use will the Mediterranean be to the Allies ? They will have to go all the way around Africa , and what means will they have to keep the Panzer forces from penetrating to India and meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cher Maitre ; the situation is the most encouraging we have yet seen . " " May I talk to you in confidence , mon ami ? " " Indeed so ; I shall feel honored . " " As you must know , I have never had any heart for this or any war . I am a man of peace , a lawyer and no killer  --  even my worst enemies will tell you that . As a French statesman , I am by no means pleased that one nation should he gaining too great power on this old Continent where we all have to live . " " I understand that , and you are right . " " What I desire to know is whether , when Russia has been forced out of this war , Britain and America can not be persuaded to listen to reason , and to make a settlement with Herr Hitler and myself , whereby a peace can be established in Europe that will last for the lifetimes of our grandchildren . All that any of us want is to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining a government in Russia that will respect the rights of private property and will not carry on propaganda of social revolution throughout the rest of the world . I have the personal word of Herr Hitler that that is all he desires , andp263that he is willing to respect and to guarantee the rights of both the British Empire and of the United States . Surely that is statesmanship , M. Budd ! " " It is , and also it is what I have been urging upon my friends . " " Here is what I have in mind , mon ami : would you be willing to takethat message to the public men of Britain and America for me ? " " Helas , cher Maitre , I do not have access to such persons ; nor do Ihave confidence in my own ability as an envoy . " " That last statement is surely a mistake ; you have the ability , and I should be glad to give you a note stating that I have authorized you to speak for me . The time to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , and before their armies have advanced into territory which they might not be so willing to give up . " " Everything you say is wise , cher Maitre ; and I promise you this  --  I will do my best to make contact with men of influence and present your views to them . " " When do you intend to return ? " " I wish to see my mother on the Riviera , and then I have several art commissions to carry out , one of them in North Africa . I hope to return to New York by way of Britain , where I have a little daughter whom I try to see as often as I can . " " If it is because of business reasons that you do this work ; M. Budd , let me make it possible for you to postpone it , and attend to this far more important commission for my government . " " Thank you for the kind offer , but I do not need money , and would not consent to take the money of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me assure you , cher ami , there is no service that would be worth so much to the people of France as to get them peace and nationalunity once more . For that they would authorize the payment of half the contents of our treasury . " The pair had a little debate over this proposal . Pierre Laval simply could n't believe that any man was actually turning down money ; it was contrary to human nature , and to good manners if not good morals . He was sure that the son of Budd-Erling was holding out for a high price , and first he offered half a million francs and then he offered a round million , to be paid in dollars in New York , and strictly on the quiet . " We know how to handle money , M. Budd . " Lanny saw that the matter was serious , and he had to be careful or he might awaken suspicions . He said that he had lived most of his life in France , and that Marianne was his fostermother ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day he might receive a medal for it , but no money . He would be willing to drop everything and go to her aid , but his recent talks with British and Americans of his way of thinking and Laval 's convinced him that the time was not yet . Let the Germans get to the Volga and across it , let them actually divert the oil of the Caucasus into the tanks of their Panzers , and then there might be a chance of putting some sense into the heads of Roosevelt and Churchill  --  or possibly of replacing them . Lanny brought encouragement to the soul of Vichy 's Premier by telling of the conspiracy of high-up Americans to do just that , and the pair shook hands warmly and parted on the basis of friendship and trust . Of course the fripon mongol would n't really trust anybody , but he would tell them that he did , and with the manner which the French call empresse . A train which needed repairs and did not run on time conveyed the P.A. to Cannes . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as he had dubbed the family buggy . The steed was thinner , it seemed to him , and so was the driver ; he congratulated her as he kissed her , and she said : " I am getting so that I can not eat when I know that so many other people are hungry . " He assured her that it was the way to live longer , and she answered that it was the way to make wrinkles deeper , and to shudder every time you caught a glimpse of your own throat . At home everything was peaceful , as much so as was possible with a World War in the newspapers and radio waves , and in the atmosphere , too , for guns were heard out at sea now and then , and military planes large and small passed overhead . Parsifal Dingle refused to let himself be troubled by the war ; it was God 's plan , otherwise it could not have been . Beauty insisted that whether it was God 's plan or Satan 's , the lovely little Marcel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become one of the rules of the household . One of the first items of news Lanny got was that his half-sister had gone back to Berlin . " Oskar crooked his finger , and she went , " said Beauty . " He wrote her , and she would n't even show me the letter . " " Perhaps he neglected to be polite , " ventured Lanny . " Or maybe he was a little too frank as to the nature of his interest . The Nazis are that way . " " Love is a terrible thing to a woman , Lanny . Marceline does not trust her man , I do n't think she even respects him ; and yet she goes to him . "  | " My guess is that snobbery has much to do with it . Oskar is an aristocrat , and she takes him at his own valuation . The more arrogant he is , the more she admires him in her secret heart , even when she herself is the victim . You brought her up wrong , Beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , making a French gesturewith the shoulders . " The world is more powerful than any person in it , and what the world admires is what a child desires . I must admit that I have looked at Marceline with surprise most of her life ; she is so self-centered , and so quietly determined . " " Why not start over again with this new one ? Let him set out to be useful at once , and let him understand that all his life he is never going to get anything without earning it . " " What strange ideas you have , Lanny ! I believe you are just as much a radical in your heart as when you were young ! " " Say that to me , but never to anybody else , " replied the son . He listened to his mother 's account of what Marceline had been doing before her departure . She had got an engagement to dance at the International Sporting Club in Monte Carlo . A fantastic story . The Italian Army was respecting the independence of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villas were packed with wealthy refugees from every country in Europe . Gambling at the Casino was going on from noon till daybreak , and hundreds of millions of francs changed hands every evening . Marceline had been paid a hundred and fifty thousand francs per week , but she had n't been happy because of the crowding  --  people sleeping even in the chairs and on the sofas of the world 's most famous gambling palace . To Lanny the place meant Sir Basil Zaharoff , who had owned it , and whom Lanny had met there as a small boy . He was moved now to try another seance with Madame , and heard the old munitions king of Europe lamenting the breakdown of the world , especially those parts of it which he had possessed and had been reluctant to leave behind him ! The Golfe Juan was still blue in the deeps and green in the shallows , and the sun set each night in glory behind the red Esterel Mountains . The oleanders along the hedge were masses of white blossoms or pink , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bees made an endless humming in the flowers , and a new half-grown puppy tumbled over himself trying to follow Marcel about . The Midi displayedall its midsummer lusciousness , and the playfolk , as distin- guished from the working folk , went about in bathing suits all day . if anybody wept for the million and a quarter young Frenchmen who were prisoners of war in Germany and were being worked as slave labor , they did their weeping alone and kept a face of courage in public . Of old , Lanny had come here to rest and to refresh himself with happy memories . But this time he came as a disturber , a herald of bad tidings . A day or two after his arrival he went into his mother 's room and shut the door . " Old darling , " he began , " we have to have a confidentialtalk , the most important ever . " " Yes , Lanny ? " she said , and a scared look came upon her face , for his tone was even more grave than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing her best to repair the ravages of time . Now she put down her tools , and he seated himself on the side of the bed , facing her . " You must have been doing a lot of guessing about your son during the last few years , and you have been very good about not talking  --  or so I have believed . " " Never a word to anyone , Lanny . " " This time is the most important of all . Here is something about which you are not to breathe the faintest hint to anybody on earth . It might cost me my life , and more important yet , it might cost the lives of a great many American boys . I really have n't the right even to speak of the matter , but I am trusting to your tact and good sense . You have to take yourself and Parsifal and the child away from Bienvenu . " " Oh , neon Dieu ! " she exclaimed . " The war is coming here ? " " You must never breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lady of the leisure class , and you have n't had any sort of trip or vacation for many years . You have a whim to see some new part of the world , some place where food is not rationed . " " Where is the place ? " " I have been trying to think of one that is n't too far away or too difficult to reach . I have decided that French Morocco would be highly suitable . " " But Lanny ! such a fantastic place ! And I keep hearing that the war may come there ! " " Trust my judgment , dear mother . Marrakech is one of the most fascinatingspots I ever visited . It is high up and reasonably cool in summer . There are elegant villas there , and you might find one to rent , and play the social queen if you have a mind to . Also , there are good hotels . It will be expensive , but do n't try to save money at this time . "  | " And when do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know the date , and if I did I would n't be free to tell it . But you have time to make your plans and build up a propaganda among your friends . It will be O.K. if you are out of France by a month from now . " " It is going to be so hard to make anybody believe that I am really interested in a trip to Morocco ! " " Put it on my account if you like . I have been there , and am going to be there again , perhaps for months . I have found a gold mine there  --  I mean , figuratively speaking . I have interested American millionaires in the marvelous fountains and floor mosaics which are in that country ; they have become quite a fad in New York , as fascinating as jigsaw puzzles . You can say that I made several thousand dollars in a single month out of them , and that I want you to help me , inspecting and overseeing the packing and shipping . That 's business , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next person . I have a book about Moroccan art , and you can pick up a few phrases and become an expert . I have photographs you can show to friends , and a letter from a millionaire ordering a fountain . With a little practice you can get yourself all steamed up . " " I suppose I could . What shall I do with Bienvenu ? " " Pick out some trustworthy French couple and put them in charge ; pay them to take care of the place . " " And the paintings , and your library ? " " We just have to take our chances with all those things . If you started packing them it would certainly look like a flight , and that would be absolutely fatal . People would say , I have just been here and have told you something to frighten you . Do n't take anything but what you would naturally take on a trip . Be a tourist , think like a tourist . " " What shall I tell Parsifal ? " " Tell him what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he is . There are many mosques in Marrakech , and he will study the Mohammedan religion and find out if they have anv psychic experiencesand what they make of them . Tell Parsifal that you have seen so little of me during the past few years , and I am going to be there off and on during the next few months . " " Shall we take Madame with us ? " " That would be too much of a burden . No one will harm an old woman here . But take a maid , of course . " " And what about Emily ? Should we not warn her ? "  | " That is a painful decision . I simply dare not take the chance of havingher leave at the same time that we do . Emily is an old woman , all but bedridden ; the worst that can happen is that her home will be taken by the military and she moved into one of her cottages . I am sure she would not be interned . " " Oh , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody can say who is coming , dear . Only a foolish person would attempt to guess the result of the clash of forces . What I have tried to do is think of some place where there is little chance of your being caught in any fighting , or of being shut up in a concentration camp for the duration  --  and this war may have a dreadful lot of duration ! It happens that I have special knowledge , and you must trust me . Play the game according to my rules . " " All right , I will take your word . One question more . What am I to do about that money I buried in the garden ? " " The best thing will be for me to dig it up and use it , and send a check for your account in your New York bank . It so happens that I have use for a lot of money in small bills , which can not be traced because of being new and having consecutive serial numbers . " " Lanny , I have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous ! " " Others are doing far more dangerous things , Mother dear . Let it rest here , that I am doing something that counts , and that some day I 'll tell you a lot of interesting stories ! " Next morning the P.A. called his old friend Jerry Pendleton on the telephone . First he inquired : " How 's business ? " and when Jerry gave the expected reply : " Rotten ! " Lanny said : " I have to go to Geneva to get a painting . Can you fix me up for the train tomorrow night ? " The travel bureau man promised to attend to it , and Lanny added : " How would you like to play some tennis this afternoon ? " They played three sets , and then went for a swim from the rocks below the estate . Sitting in the hot sunshine , with the insurgent waves drowning his low voice , Lanny opened up : " Do you suppose your wife could run the bureau for a while , Jerry ? " " A child could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the French call a petit bourgeois , and the Americans a small businessman ; by either name his situation was unpromising . Lanny looked at this good fellow who had once been his tutor , al/though only half a dozen years older . The Army had claimed him in World War I , and he had risen to be a lieutenant ; but he had n't bothered to come home , he had stayed and married a French girl and a pension , or so he had said , in his playful fashion . Now Lanny observedthat Jerry 's hair was turning gray . He remarked : " You are worrying , are n't you ? " " Well , " was the reply , " it 's hard to run a travel bureau when people ca n't travel and to run a pension when the cost of food goes up faster than the boarders ' incomes . " " Have you thought about the danger of staying on here ? " " Of course ; but what can I do ? I ca n't afford to drop everything and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an idea to suggest . I have come onto a fairly prosperous business , buying mosaics in Morocco and shipping them to New York . I told Beauty about it , and she has taken a notion to go in with me . She thinks she 'd like to see Marrakech , and Parsifal wants to study the Mohammedan religion . " " Jeepers ! " exclaimed the ex-tutor . " Is n't that a sort of dangerous place to be in ? I keep hearing talk about our Army coming to Casa-blanca . " " Well , suppose they do ? The fighting will be at the coast , and Marrakech is a hundred miles or so in the interior . From what I 've learned of the French Army there they could n't stand up against us very long even if they wanted to , which I do n't think they will . And when they give up , any Americans who are there will be in America , and without the expense of crossing the ocean . " " You know the situation better than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there than here when the fighting starts ; for it 's certain that if we invade any French territory , the Germans will move here . They have to do it , not merely to keep us from landing here , but to keep the French from helping us . " " Yes , and their first move will be to intern all the Americans , especially the able-bodied men . " " This is what has occurred to me , Jerry . You know Beauty  --  she has all the social gifts and can help by getting introductions and oiling the machinery , but she 's not much good at the details of a business . I thought you might travel with the party as a sort of secretary , and when you get there , I could put you to work for a while and pay you enough to get along and have a bit to send back home . " " That 's very handsome of you , Lanny . What is it , just kindness ? " " Not at all . I 'll promise you plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put only one condition on it , that you do n't say a word about it until I tell you to come , and then you just tell Cerise that you are helping Beauty on the trip . When you 're safe in Morocco , you can write her that you 're staying a while longer . You understand , Cerise wo n't be in any danger here because she 's French , and the Germans are behaving correctly . But if you were to tell her about it now she might be tempted to tell her aunt , or one of the servants might overhear , and I ca n't afford to have my name talked about in this connec-tion . " " Mum 's the word , " replied this dependable friend . And then with a grin : " I wonder who Mum was . " The art expert was retracing his footsteps of the previous spring , except that he visited Geneva ahead of Toulon . Among the conservativedisciples of John Calvin he set to work to make his presence known to art dealers and collectors ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at the address which he had stowed away carefully in his memory . " Just a line to let you know I 'm in town . Bienvenu . " He went to the public library next afternoon and made connections with Monck in the usual cautious way . In the evening they took a long walk , and rested as before on the steps of the League of Nations building , a mausoleum to them , the tomb of their hopes of past years . The German had a lot to report . Colonel Donovan 's organization had sent a man to him , a young college instructor of German descent , a man of keen intelligence with whom Monck was especially well pleased . The agent had given him money , and later had produced some apparatus . Monck did n't say what it was , but Lanny could guess that it was a radio-sending outfit . There were hints that several other people had gone to work ; Monck did n't know the details , but he said that it was encouraging to have such competent support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been drained almostdry ; but now a new aqueduct was being constructed , and soon a mighty new stream would be flowing in . Monck talked more freely than he had done before ; it was as if he . were preparing to come out from underground . Lanny had to warn him not to become too confident ; it would be a long time yet before an American army could enter Germany . But they would be fighting somewhere before this year was over , that much a P.A. was free to tell his friend in confidence . Fresh from a visit to the Budd-Erling ;  |p271|plant  , and from driving on Highway Number i , he could testify that the sleeping giant overseas was stirring his limbs and getting to his feet . " As sure as tomorrow 's sunrise , the Nazis are going to be knocked out . " The old-time labor man and Social Democrat replied that these were the most pleasant words he had ever heard . He reported on the results of his own inquiries . His " contact " had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany was makingor preparing to make schweres Wasser . Indeed , the physicist had seen the blueprints of a very ' elaborate plant , but unfortunately he had never been told where the plant was to be located . " It is dangerous to ask questions in Germany nowadays , even of one 's intimate friends . " Oddly enough , the man went on to say , he had got some information about conditions in America , where there existed only a few quarts of " heavy water " ; it was one of the scarcest products of the new physics . The question of jet propulsion was not so ultra-secret , not because the Nazis did n't want it so , but because the job was far advanced and therefore had to have workers sharing the secret . There were a number , both Communists and Socialists , who had joined the Nazi party as a means of surviving , but who still kept the old faith buried in their hearts . Every day it became plainer to the workers that they were going to have to face a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World ; if only the Russians could hold out through this summer and autumn , many of the German workers would become desperate and would risk their lives to tell what they knew . Said Monck : " I have sent out the call , and I 'm waiting for echoes to come back . It is n't something that can be done in a few days . I hope and trust that people are working on it , and that some day I 'll get answers , and possibly even the blueprints . " Lanny had no right to complain . He was n't risking anything , but was staying in a palace hotel , the Beau Rivage , and strolling about looking at objets d'art . In the lining of his coat was a tiny oblong of paper with six words written on it , and this burned inward all the way to his heart ; he longed so to use it , and was sure that if he were to address a note to Fuhrer Adolf Hitler at the New Chancellery in Berlin , a telegram would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bring him to the Hauptstadt , or to the Fiihrer 's Hauptquartier , wherever it might be . But what could Lanny accomplish , so far as concerned either atomic fission or jet propulsion ? He was an enemy alien now , and would be watched every moment , no matter how plausible his story and how charming his manners ; very certainly he would not be permitted to chat with any nuclear physicists or designersof supersonic projectiles . And anyhow , F.D.R. had said no , and until he said yes , Lanny would have to go on traveling en prince in neutral lands . The best he could do was to pump this ex-sailor and ex-capitan completelydry of information concerning conditions in Germany and Switzerland . It was a mild night , and they were in an open place where no one could steal up behind them . They kept their voices low . Monck told about some of the comrades who had been helping him and who now were gone  --  these were the only ones he could mention . Some of them had been Trudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now seemed a hundred years past . " What fools we were ! " remarked the Social Democratic leader . " We actually believed that the great cartelmasters would let us organize and vote them out of power ! " " And we thought the workers would stand by us when it came to a showdown ! " responded the American . " We gave them credit for too much intelligence , Monck , and the capitalists for too little . " " Hider is a cunning knave , you must remember . " " Part knave and part genius , Genosse . " " I suppose we have to admit that . It would seem as if some devil had constructed him especially to hoodwink the German folk and lead them to utter ruin and despair . " " The Pied Piper of Hamelin town ! " said Lanny . Just before leaving Bienvenu the P.A. had stopped in Cannes and rented a typewriter of German make ; at home he had spent several hours producing a document labeled : " Professor Zimmermann 's Examination Questions . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Lanny had received instructions from the young Jewish doctor of science . They represented the matters concerning which American physicists wished to ascertain how far the German physicists were informed ; each question was one which Lannv had learned by heart and had kept reciting to himself ever since leaving the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton . Several of the questions read : " What is the significance of the formula "  --  and then followed one of those assemblages of mathematical symbols which , so far as the layman was concerned , might as well have been ancient Hittite or modern Gujerati . Each formula contained carefully studied errorsp273which would lead the German scientists astray if it fell into the wrong hands ; but any scientist who redly knew the advanced steps toward atomic fission would correct the errors . Dr. Braunschweig 's last words had been : " Do not tell even your trusted agent that the formulas are wrong . The errors are a means of testing what comes back to us . " Coming from Bienvenu , Lanny had carried this document pinned to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he unpinned it and laid it in Monck 's hands , also the pin , and saw the German make it safe in the same manner . Lanny explained : " Professor Zimmermann is a topflightphysicist who happens to be an especially ardent Nazi . If this paper should come into possession of the Gestapo , they would call upon this learned gentleman to explain for whom his examination questionswere intended , and this might cause at least a temporary slowing up of German progress in nuclear science . " Monck said : " I will put my man to work on it . " Lanny gave his comrade some of the money he had dug up from under Beauty 's yellow oleander ; after which he went to his hotel room and slept well . In the morning he typed out a report on what he had learned and took it out and dropped it into a postbox  --  he was n't afraid to trust the mails in this six-hundred-year-old republic . He spent the day visiting his art friends , and purchased a portrait by Mary Cassatt of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Mrs. Fotheringay , his client in Chicago who had a mansion full of painted babies . Having thus established himself as an art expert and no spy , Lanny took the night train back to the Riviera . He had only a few duties left : the first , to pay a call upon Emily Chattersworth and do what he could to cheer her up . This was n't easy , for she said that her world had come to an end . And indeed it was so , the world that she had known and enjoyed was gone , probably forever . Beauty had n't yet told her about the harebrained plan of buying mosaics in Morocco ; Lanny did n't want to have to discuss the idea with Emily ; he was n't sure he could make it sound plausible to her shrewd mind . To flee and leave this old friend behind seemed cruel ; but , on the other hand , to take a semi-invalid with them would be telling the world that Lanny had special information about events in the making . He visited several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the proceeds of their sale . Sooner or later the funds would be running low ; and this was a cruel world , in which , when your funds were gone , nobody brought you any food , nobody preparedit for you or served it to you , and your friends had a tendencyp274to cross to the other side of the street , for fear that you might start trying to borrow from them . But Lanny would be on hand and would say tactfully : " If you would care to put a price on that Ingres , I know a gentleman in New York who might be interested . " Then he would say , even more tactfully : " I am sorry , but I fear that is much too high . I do n't think I could advise my client to pay more than half the sum . " Lanny had written to " M. Guillaume Bruges " at Toulon , saying that he would soon arrive to inspect the sketches about which M. Bruges had informed him . There was a train that ran along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the villas that you feared it was going to hit them . If you were rich and could afford premiere classe , you could be comfortable . Lanny with his carefully packed suitcases and little portable typewriter boarded the morning train , and a couple of hours later descended in Toulon and was driven in an old-style fiacre to the Grand Hotel . All hotels were crowded , but " there was always room for a gentleman who was known to be-a friend of the military commandant of the port . Lanny made it a point to inquire of the hotel clerk what sort of transportation he could get to the mansion of the D'Avrienne family in the suburbs ; he had come , so he said , for the purpose of giving further study to an art collection of which the city was proud . He had dropped a note , requesting permission , and now there was a reply awaiting him at the hotel , and he did not fail to refer to it . Also , he asked whether any new art dealers had set themselves up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for them ; and it was pure chance that he happened to be passing the bookstore of Armand Mercier . It was chance , also , that he happened to see on the stall in front of the shop a book that interested him . It was natural for a clerk to come out to see if he wished to make a purchase ; and nobody heard the words which the clerk murmured : " Twenty hours , at the statue of the Genius of Navigation . " Lanny moved on , and inspected paintings in the shops , and admired them even though he found them commonplace . He inquired about old masters and made note of where some might be found ; he did all this , knowing that rumors would spread and help to make him persona grata . The law required all foreigners to register with the police , and Lanny went and reported himself as on the way to Algiers ; he was stopping by for a couple of days to find out if there was a possibilityp275of obtaining examples of the art of painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excel all the rest of the world . The statement that " fine words butter no parsnips " had originated in England and would surely never have occurred to anyone who had been raised in the Midi ! Promptly at the hour set , Lanny made contact with his friend , and they strolled in obscure streets , taking pains to make certain that no one was following . Their destination was the beautiful gardens of the hospital , out on Cap Cepet which forms one arm of the harbor . They found a quiet spot , in the open , there being sufficient moonlight so that no one could approach without detection . Speaking in low murmurs the ex-schoolman revealed that a man had come from Colonel Donovan'soffice , and that the little group of the underground were well pleased with what he had brought them and had promised . Raoul himself had n't met the man . " You know , Lanny , the fact that I am a Spaniard and worked for the Republican government makes me vulnerable . If ever the flics should take my fingerprints they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid the rafles , the round-ups in which they collect slave workers for Germany . I make friends among the workers , and listen , and try to pick out the honest comrades from the police agents and spies . It is dreadfully difficult these days ; you have to guard every word you say , every gesture , and every expression of your face . " " I know , " Lanny answered . " I worry about you ; but we greatly need your help . " " You want to know about the Fleet . There is a civil war here , as everywhere in France . Partly it is the class war  --  three-quarters of the marins are for the Allies , whereas three-quarters of the officers are for tradition , that is to say , for obeying orders whatever they may be . Of course the situation is complicated by what the British did at Mersel-Kebir ; a good part of the men hate them heartily for that ; but few hate the Americans , and if the common sailors could have their way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command . " " That is unlikely , of course . The question is , whether they will let themselves be put under German command . " " That surely can not happen , Lanny . There would be a mutiny on every ship . "  | " What is the truth about the Germans being taught how to run the machinery ? " " That is being done to some extent . The officers claim they can not refuse to comply with German demands . There is an underground war going on over the issue . Wherever the Germans come , our nzarins of course know it , and they get together and agree to teach them wrongly as far as possible . They know what the Nazis want and hate their very guts . Naturally we make the most of the situation . I have written three leaflets that have been printed ; many of the men have had a chance to read them . That is one of the ways your Intelligence man has been able to help us , with money , and now he has promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you yourself need money , Raoul ? " " I can use some always ; and so can Julie . She , being French , is not in as much danger as I. Believe me , I remember the months I spent in a concentration camp . The French are a grand people in many ways , but their treatment of the politically suspect  --  well , I 'd get out of this country if I did n't see so much to be done . " " The critical time is near , Raoul . I do n't know the day or the place , but I can tell you this much ; the Americans are coming to the Mediterranean , and it will be this year . " " That is great news , of course ; but it wo n't satisfy our little group ; they want to see the Army here tomorrow ! The fortifications of Toulonare powerful , but they do n't extend very far to the east or the west , and landings could be made and the port surrounded . " " No doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your friends have to do is to save the Fleet , or at any rate keep it out of German hands . No one could exaggerate the importance of that . So long as the Germans do n't have it , we can command the Mediterraneanand can land at any place we select . The day we land on French territory , you can be sure the Germans will come down here in force , and they will use every stratagem they know to get the ships . That is when you must act , and put in everything you have . I probably wo n't be here , so I 'm telling you now : get ready for the day . The fate of the war might depend upon it  --  at least for years . " Raoul urged his friend to tell these things directly to the leaders of his group . There were differences of opinion , he explained , but allp277three had been tremendously impressed by that little engraved visiting card with the name of President Roosevelt on it . Lanny said : " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered , what would they make of the other bit of paper which was sewed up in his coat ? An appointment was made for the following evening , and Lanny returned to his hotel . He discovered that his baggage had been gone through , not very skillfully . He had left his correspondence conveniently on top , his address list and his data on Moorish and Arab art . Nothing had been taken . In the morning he inspected the D'Avrienne treasures again , and visited more art dealers , and took the trouble to get permission to see another collection about which he had been informed . In the evening he dined upon fish , newly caught in that old sea which had fed so many human tribes for so many thousands of years . Then he went for a " constitutional , " and stopped to look in shop windows , and out of the corner of his eye made certain that nobody else was stopping at the same time . When at last he picked up his Spanish friend , they walked separately around a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dark alleyway . In the same dingy room were the three comrades to whom Lanny had told his life story : Jean Catroux , the Communist , who wished to he known as Zed ; Soulay , the docker , tough and weatherbeaten ; and the mysterious young woman who had first been Mlle. Richard and now was Mlle. Bleret . Zed was either the leader , or else the more talkative ; he said : " Bonsoir , Camarade Zhone . Asseyez-vous , s'il vous plait . " Comrade Jones took a vacant chair , and the spokesman continued : " We have met the agent you sent to us , and everything is satisfactory . We do n't know whether you know this man , or wish to know . about him . " Lanny 's reply was : " I do not know him , and I much prefer not to share any secret that is not necessary to my work . I only want to be sure you have got what you want . " " We have , and we thank you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will repeat for your benefit , that there is to be an American invasion of the Mediterranean area before the end of the present year . There was a conference of the general staffs of Britain and America last month , and that was the decision . I have it upon the highest authority , and you may accept it as settled . The exact place and date are still to be determined , but your duties are the same in any case . You are asked to do everything in your power to make certain that the French Fleet does not fall into the hands of the Germans . That is the one absolutely vital thing that is within the field of your efforts . " " We have been told that , Comrade Jones , and we are doing our best and hope to do more . " " You should try to win the confidence of individual sailors and persuadethem to organize so far as it can be done ; you should also try to win officers ; there are many who understand the principles of the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely the sailors , but the arsenal workers , the dockers , the whole labor force of this port must be prepared to rise in a mass movement , to seize arms , and to make every building at the harbor a fortress to keep the Germansaway from the ships . " " You are perhaps aware , Comrade Jones , that the Germans have compelled our commanders to reduce the fuel in the tanks , so that the ships can not make their escape . " " I have been told that , and if that is the situation when the crisis comes , it will be necessary to sink the vessels . Men must be found with courage enough to open the seacocks , and then stand by and defendthe ships while they sink . There have been such heroes in French history , I know , because my stepfather , the painter Marcel Detaze , was shot down in an observation balloon and had his face burned off ; nevertheless , in the last desperate days of the second battle of the Marne , he took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We know that story , comrade . " It was the woman speaking , and Lanny turned toward her . She had been gazing at him intently out of her fine brown eyes , something he had observed on the previous occasionswhen they had met . She was an extremely attractive young woman , so Lanny had thought at the beginning , and he still thought it : slender and graceful , with sensitive features and an ardent expression . He had been interested to make her acquaintance ; but now the circumstances had changed and he was a bit afraid of her . All his life he had been made aware that ladies " fell for him " easily , and he knew the world well enough not to attribute it altogether to his personal charms . He had n't been more than six years old when Robbie had pointed out to him that he was the grandson of an American millionaireand might some day be the son of such a godlike being ; the ladies would find that out , somehow or other , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or old  --  he would have to be aware of that special danger . Now , desiring no entanglements , he remarked : " Let me tell you , comrades , that a few years ago I was married to a German artist of talent , a Socialist who did not give way to the Nazis.  |p279She  was seized by them and tortured to death , but she did not betray any of the secrets with which she had been entrusted . She used to quote to me the words of a German poem , supposed to be spoken by the Tirolese hero , Andreas Hofer : TI'ir sired all des Todes eigen , ' that is to say , Nous appartenons tour a la mort . ' Such is the spirit in which we have to work in these tragic days , men , women , and even children ; we all belong to death . That is true of me , and also of my wife , for I have recently been married to an ardent comrade who would be here with me tonight , except that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of this statement upon the mademoiselle , Lanny turned his eyes to the sturdy dockworker with the well-browned skin and leathery hands . " It would be well , ComradeSoulay , if a few of you enfants de la patrie could get hold of some sticks of dynamite and plant them under the vital machinery of the arsenal before the Germans arrive . It would be better yet if you would study some of the bridges and tunnels and wreck them to delay the enemy 's approach . This one thing you have to get clear , and do n't let anybody persuade you otherwise  --  the instant they get word that an American soldier has set foot upon French soil , whether here or in North Africa , the Panzers and the parachutists will set out for Toulon . So do n't let anything delay you ; be ready to act the first night , because that may be the only night you have . " " Que vows avez raison ! " said the horny-handed enfant . FROM Toulon to Marseille is another short train journey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Budd on the same steamer which had carried him to Algiers the previous time . The great " midland sea " was still and the air was hot in midsummer , and again Lanny spent the night on deck . Late the next afternoonthere loomed up that shining white city on the steep hillslopes ,  | and once more a bus took him on the boulevard which runs along the shore , ascending slowly , and then turns and comes back in the opposite direction , still ascending . The bus continued into the suburbs until it came to a high , level spot which had been made into a beautiful garden , and here was a hotel prepared to provide a collector of mosaics with every comfort , provided that he could pay the high price . The faithful Hajek had been notified and was on hand . He had been seeking new art treasures , and soon the visitor was immersed in those elaborate negotiations which he found amusing . They were the custom of the country , made him a great gentleman , and provided protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ordering a cup of coffee or a glass of wine you had the right to sit and read all the newspapers in the place , so by bargaining over several fountains for ablutions and buying one of them Lanny could have the right to hold secret conferences with as many conspirators as he could find in Algiers . Capitaine Denis de Bruyne came to the hotel and they sat under an arbor , conversing in low tones . Lanny told about his meeting with Charlot , and it was sad . Denis was not so bitter against his brother as the brother was against him . Denis took the position that Chariot was a strayed lamb whom he yearned to bring back into the fold . But Lanny could n't hold out any hope ; he had to report that Charlot had completely committed himself to the collaborateurs and could not be brought to hear reason . The older brother sat with his lips pressed togetherand the knuckles showing white in his clenched hands . " If only I could talk to him ! " he lamented . Lanny replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You will have to leave it to events to change his mind . " " What events will do is to get him shot ! " exclaimed the brother . Lanny gave an account of his visits to Washington and London , and , of the decision taken by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff . Denis , a man of honor , could be trusted with the great secret . Lanny told him that it was certain to be North Africa , and hardly possible that Algiers should not be one of the first ports taken . It was to be an invasion in force , and the troops would come to stay . " It is most important for us to be sure of that , " said the younger man . " We shall be staking our lives upon it . Our friends have been terribly discouraged by Dieppe . "  |p281He  was referring to an event which had just been reported , of course with the high coloring the collaborationist press gave to all German successes . Some five thousand troops , mostly Canadians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold portions of the harbor for half a day . They had been forced to retire , and if you could believe the Algiers papers , they had lost several vessels of war , a great fleet of planes , and more than half the men who had taken part . The Germans had given them a bloody lesson and vindicated the claim that the Channel coast was invulnerable . Lanny said : " It was a commando raid , Denis ; a big one , but still a raid . It had to be undertaken because the Canadians were so impatient . What I am talking about is an invasion , with force enough to take and hold all French North Africa . You know how the Americans came last time , and the job they did ; they are coming again , and in far greater force . We are building an army of eight million men , and the decision has been taken to open up the Mediterranean , destroy Rommel'sarmy , and build air bases to put Italy out of the war . That is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they can stop tomorrow 's sunrise . " The other replied : " I am ready to stake my life on my faith in you , Lanny ; but you can understand how hard it is for a Frenchman to believe in success any more . For almost three years we have seen nothing but defeats , all over the world , and we have got the habit of despair . " " That is because you have to see the war through the enemy 's spectacles . We in the outside world see it differently . The siege of London has certainly not been a defeat for Britain , and the sieges of Leningrad and Moscow have not been defeats for the Soviet Union . I am told by friends at home who are close to sources of information that we destroyedsomething more than a third of Japan 's most highly trained flyers at the Battle of Midway , and we are destroying more every day in the struggle for the Solomons . Those things do n't show up in the daily reports , but they are bound to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seems far off to us , Lanny . Here in North Africa we contemplatethe fact that Rommel is only seventy miles from Alexandria , and that reinforcements and supplies are being poured in by way of Funis and the other ports so close to Italy . I have been told that in Cairo there is a trac , a panic . The well-to-do residents are packing their belongings into their cars and preparing to flee to Palestine or to wherever they can go . " " That may be , Denis ; but it is not the well-to-do residents who fight battles , and it may be they are encouraged to take themselves away and relieve the food situation by that much . What you do not hear about are the convoys we have been sending around South Africa and up through the Suez Canal . ' We have a new tank called the General Sherman that is believed to be good , and we have a self-propelled antitankgun that the Desert Fox is n't going to . like a bit when he hears it go off . Do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of Africa , and we are sending all kinds and sizes of planes to Cairo . I have no idea when the British will feel strong enough to attack , but I do know that they have been bringing up forces from all over the Middle East , and you can be sure that Rommel will have to do a lot more fighting before he gets to Alexandria , to say nothing of Suez . " Lanny was taken again to the apartment of Professor Aboulker , and had another session with him and the two Royalists , D'Astier de la Vigerie and the Jesuit Father Cordier . Lanny did not reveal to these three that he was positive about the Allied decision ; he contented himself with saying that he had checked upon and verified his previous information , which was that the big attack was to come by way of the Mediterranean and was to be this year . Since Algiers was the most important French city in North Africa , it was fair to assume that it would be included in the program . Lanny was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this group ; the news pleased him greatly , for it meant that " Wild Bill " and his miscellaneous crowd were missing no openings . The Frenchmen professed to be satisfied with what they had got ; the Americans were a wonderful people . When this group learned that Lanny had been in London , they wanted to know if he had visited General de Gaulle . The truth was that he had kept as far from the French Joan of Arc as possible , for he had got the impression both in London and New York that the headquarters of this movement was beset with spies , intriguers , and publicity seekers . But he could n't say this to Frenchmen in exile , who knew the General only by his radio eloquence . When they asked why President Roosevelt did not at once espouse this great leader 's cause and place him at the head of the expedition , Lanny answered tactfully that the President was doing his best to distinguish between the winningof the war , which was the American task , and the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in which Americans had to exercise care to avoid even seeming to interfere . France was anp283ally , and all Frenchmen would be friends , save only those who had chosen to be friends of the Nazis . This statement pleased the group , and Lanny could only hope that when the Army came it would have some advisers who understood this touchy people . Here in this apartment were five Frenchmen determined to work like all possessed for the occasion which the Americans oddly called " D-day . " Their movement was spreading rapidly , and the different groups were at one in their desire to make as much trouble as possible for the enemy . Lanny promised to let them know what was coming and when ; but they must understand that the Germans had many submarines , to say nothing of dive-bombing planes , and these constitutedgreater menaces than anything likely to be encountered on shore . Therefore every effort must be made to deceive the enemy as to the destination of the great convoy , and the friends of the cause must not expect definite information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sound so good to the conspirators , and M. d'Astier remarked : " If our Chantiers de la Jeunesse take the key points of Algiers and then your troops do n't come ashore , hundreds of French lads and all their leaders will be shot . " Lanny replied : " I will explain the situation to Washington , and no doubt Mr. Murphy will do it also . A code must be arranged , and you must know exactly what steps to take at every stage of the landing . " The visitor inspected several fountains and made himself conspicuousas an art expert , telling about his achievement in starting a new fad among the American rich . This would have the effect of increasing the prices of what he hoped to buy , but under the circumstances he did n't mind that ; his client , Mr. Vernon , would be making a contributiontoward saving the lives of American soldiers . In the salons of the Algerian nabobs , in their town houses and their magnificent estates at the foot of the mountain range , Lanny discoursed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to appreciate ; he rallied them because they were content with butchers ' calendars for paintings , while the wealthy of New York were sending an agent to North Africa to snatch ancient Moroccan masterpieces from under their noses . In one of these soirees he ran into the vegetable-oil king , and that gentleman , professing friendship , was hurt because M. Budd hadn't looked him up . Lanny went to lunch again at the Golf Club , and let himself be pumped dry concerning what was going on in New York and Washington , London and Madrid , Vichy and Cannes . He did n't mind it , for he told only what could do no harm , and he charged a good price for the service . M. Lemaigre-Dubreuil was a fountainhead of information about the leading personalities of Algeria , both French and German , to say nothing of American . He was a man to encourage , for he had great power and was ready and eager to make a deal for his own safety . The son of Budd-Erling was the sort of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the policy of the American Army and administration to French capital in these colonial lands . He had heard so much about " That Man , " and his dangerous prejudices against all " economic royalists . " Lanny explained that F.D.R. was doingwhat he could to cut the ground from under the Communists by persuading the super-rich to part with some of their excessive gains . His New Deal was a milder set of measures than the British Tories had introduced two or three decades ago . This statement comforted the representative of the " two . hundred families , " now preparing to seek shelter under the Stars and Stripes . Members of the haute bourgeoisie of Algiers were making money fast . They had found secret ways to undermine the Nazi system , by bribing individual officials of the Reichswehr , the Partei , or the various commissions which were looking out for German interests . " Some day the war will be over , " a French high bourgeois would say to a Nazi big or little wig , " and then you will have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common sense to lay a little by ? " This would enable the Frenchman to get hold of a block of stock in some bank or industry that was being acquired by the Germans , and then to transfer the shares to a newly organized holding concern in Switzerlandor Sweden , Spain or the Argentine . They whispered about these stratagems among themselves , and when they had come to know the son of Budd-Erling well enough they let him hear the whispers . They even offered to let him in on some of the good things , going fifty-fifty , of course . Lanny would smile amiably and say that whenever he had any money to spare he put it into his father 's business ; and he offered to let them in on that without any commission whatever . Some took him seriously and asked questions about Budd-Erling stocks ; they had the most exaggerated ideas about the earnings of airplane shares , and equally exaggerated fears as to what would happen to such shares when the fighting stopped !  |p285Lanny  listened attentively and learned new things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could shake a stick at , or even a whole bundle of sticks tied together with a cord and with an ax in the middle of them . Such had been the symbol carried before the ancient Roman lictors , proclaiming to the world their authority to flog backs and to chop off heads . The fasces , the bundle was called , and Mussolini and his gang had taken it over and used its name and its threat . Now Il Duce 's sticks were falling apart , and if you could believe the big-business emigres of North Africa , the Fiihrer was struggling in vain against the same forces of disintegration . Every American knows the phrase , " Business is business , " and every Frenchmanknows " Les a f f aires sont les aft aires . " The Germans had their version : " Gescha f t ist Gescha f t " ! A rather amusing episode arose out of Lanny 's dealings with the vegetable-oil king . The latter said : " I mentioned you to Mr. Robert Murphy , and he expressed a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny had been carefully keeping away from the Counselor and his twelve vice-consuls  --  one of whom , according to the gossip now going the rounds , had fallen under the spell of a French woman who was revealed to be a Nazi spy ! Lanny , a spy himself , did n't want to have anything to do with any of his fellow workers , whether German , French , or American . But he could n't very well say that he was unwilling to make the acquaintance of the man who was his country 's ambassador to this colonial world . He told Lemaigre that such a meetingwould give him pleasure , and Lemaigre offered to arrange another luncheon . Lanny protested that it ought to be his turn , but the other answered that it was such a small matter they surely did n't have to talk about it ; some day they would meet in America , and then it would be the American 's turn to feed the Frenchman . Lanny gave thought to this meeting in advance . He had heard about Mr. Murphy wherever he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a super-important person . Many of the farseeing French were looking upon him as soon to be consul , not in the modern commercial sense , but in the ancient Roman sense , the civil governor of a province . He was a person acceptable to the French because he was a Catholic , and also because he was genial and friendly , a democrat in the human sense of that word . The Americans had sent such a representative to France in the days when the young nation was striving to be born ;  | his name was Benjamin Franklin , and he had made a hit with the liberal elements of France both rich and poor . It was very probable that Mr. Murphy had read about this eminent predecessor , and would try in a modest way to follow his footsteps . Lanny was bound to assume that Mr. Murphy , a career diplomat in Paris prior to the war , was nobody 's fool . He could hardly have failed to have suspicions concerning a fellow countryman who traveled about so freely in wartime . Mr. Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Traveler , " and he had orders to forwardthese promptly in the diplomatic pouches , which couriers bore by way of Tangier , the Azores , and Brazil . Could the Counselor have failed to note the fact that these letters ceased when Mr. Budd left North Africa and were resumed when he came back ? Could the thought have failed to occur to him that his Chief had set somebody to watching him and his twelve subordinates ? Mr. Murphy would have been less than human if he had not been curious about such a person ; and he would have been less than a shrewd diplomat if he had not " pumped " the vegetable-oil king on the subject and hinted that a meetingmight he brought about in a way that world not seem too obvious . Lanny had been told by Roosevelt that he might reveal himself to the Counselor if he saw fit , but he had decided not to see fit just now . What the P.A. had on his mind were those six words which Hess had written on a scrap of paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany . If that should come about , the less he had had to do with American agents in North Africa , the better for him . He knew that the place was swarming with agents of the enemy 's ArmisticeCommission . Now and then one of them sought out Herr Budd , who talked volubly about the charms of Arab and Moroccan architecture , and the wonders of Timgad which he had seen and of Volubilisabout which he had been told . He expressed also the conviction that war was a sad and cruel thing , with which an art lover could not possibly have anything to do . And he was careful not to let any one of them get him alone in a dark alley . The career diplomat came to the Golf Club ; tall , handsome , comfortablydressed , but not at all " high-hat . " He was an agreeable talker , and Lanny liked to listen , but knew that he had not been invited there for this purpose . Presently the Counselor mentioned having been told that Mr. Budd had had the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation , and Lanny talked about the personal characteristics of Numbers One , Two , and Three , and told illustrative anecdotes . Mr. Murphy asked the art expert 's guess as to the circumstancesunder which the war might end . When and how would the Nazis give up ? To this Lanny said that Hitler was a fanatic and would die fighting like a rat in a corner ; Goring , on the other hand , was a practical man and had sound military judgment ; he would know when victory was no longer possible . Lanny smiled as he said : " I think he would be willing to surrender all Germany , provided that he was allowed to keep his castles , and the money he has deposited abroad , and above all , his art collection . " They commented upon that curious psychological complexity , a genuine love of beauty combined with monstrous greed . The Frenchmantold a story about a refugee of his acquaintance , a German Jew who had been a great capitalist and had owned fine paintings . For a moment Lanny thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was another man , who had lived in Nurnberg . He had been put under house arrest , for his own good , he was told , to protect him against the anti-Semitic mobsters . The person who came to give him advice and to aid his exit from Germany was none other than the fat Marshal 's wife . " Emmy Sonnemann , the actress , " Lanny remarked . " I had the pleasure of meeting her several times . She is a really kindhearted person and tried to help a number of the Jews . " " Maybe so , " replied the vegetable-oil man . " The way she helped this particular Jew was by telling him that he had to sell his art works , his palace , and his shares in several big German companies , all for a few thousand marks . Emmy 's husband was the buyer , and I have often wondered if Emmy got a commission on the deal . " " My God ! " exclaimed Lanny . He was astounded , for he had thought that this stage star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought so , too ; she was built on a generous scale , the very archetypeof Nordic blond beauty , praised by Hitler under the name of " Aryan . " Lanny said : " I did n't think there was anything more for me to learn about the Nazis , but I see I was naive . " In his mind was the night which he and his father had spent in Karinhall , and in their bedroom Robbie had written on a scrap of paper , being afraid that the room might be " wired , " a warning to his son not to be too cordial in manner to the Reichsmarschall 's wife . Goring was known to be of a jealous temperament , and Robbie was afraid that he might resent even the ordinary social courtesies.  | When the time came for the luncheon party to break up Lanny decided to make a brief " pass " at the Counselor . He remarked : " My mother is living on the Riviera , and she is talking about coming to Morocco this fall to help me in selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what to advise her . Can you tell me whether it is likely to be safe ? " There were only three in the private room , and certainly there was n't any reason for caution in the presence of the vegetable-oil king . In his talks with Lanny this man of great affairs had made plain that he knew what was coming , and Lanny suspected that he had got it from his Irish-American friend . But perhaps Mr. Murphy did n't realize that Lanny had got that far with the French collaborator . What he answeredwas : " I wish I could tell you . I hear many reports , but I really could n't say . " Lanny recognized this as the kind of skillful answer he had been taught to cultivate from his youth on . Mr. Robert Murphy had n't made any false statement . No doubt he " wished " that he could tell , just as he wished many other good things  --  that the war was over , and that the world was a better place , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he heard many reports and read many , and he " could n't " say  --  because he had been told not to . ( He had just come back from a flying visit to Washington and London . ) Lanny took a plane to Casablanca , leaving the faithful but too talkativeHajek to follow by the slower method of the rundown railroad . The P.A. had already written a note to General Bethouart , at military headquarters , saying that he was coming and hoped to have a chance to inspect the especially fine mosaic which the General had told him about . The General had n't told any such thing , but Lanny guessed that he would n't be too dumb , and he was n't . There came to the hotel a note making an appointment for the next day ; and when the pair met they did n't talk about objets d'art , but about the American agents who were now at work in " Casa , " and when was the Army coming , and in what force ? There were several key persons whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons whose help would be invaluable , but who would not move until they were certain that the great Army overseas was no dream . They were ready to climb onto the bandwagon , but not until they heard the music ! Beauty had written to Algiers , and now she wrote to Morocco.  |p289Lanny  had warned her not to say a word about her reasons for coming , or to ask any questions , and to this she carefully conformed . She said that good old Jerry had offered to escort them , not even asking for his expenses . Of course she was insisting upon paving these . " As you know , " wrote this playful mother , " I have never failed to have a man to lean on ' if I could get him , and usually I could . Parsifal , I fear , will not be much good for travel , because he is absent-minded and is apt to be saying his prayers ' while the train conductor is asking for his tickets , or while the cusstoms man is going through ' his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epistolary style that she used a great many quotation marks , seeming to have the idea that they served for emphasis . Also , she was not strong on spelling , and the small dictionarywhich Lanny had bought for her always got covered up by other things . When he called her attention to errors , her answer would be : " Gertrude Stein writes as she pleases and gets away with it , so why should n't I ? " Anyhow , she was coming , and on a baking hot day Lanny went by the four-hour , overcrowded , dusty train to Marrakech and made hotel arrangements for the party . Incidentally he renewed acquaintance with the Moorish caid who owned an oasis and had presented him with a mosaic . Lanny had sent him in return a snappy chiming clock with bright-colored figures which came out and danced the hours . This gift was appreciated immensely , so Lanny had to attend another of those overwhelming banquets . He could n't mention to this host that he was seeking a fountain , lest it be taken for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very soon the word spread throughout the city , small in population but large in acreage . Partly it was an " old town , " and partly a retreat for the rich , both native and foreign , with large estates planted in orange trees and date palms . They had very little interest in their native art and spent immense sums of money upon the crudest and gaudiest objects produced in Europe and Americafor colonial markets . In this great center of Mohammedan piety , ritual ablutions were common , and fountains for that purpose were everywhere . Lanny inspectedmany and picked out one he wanted . He directed Hajek to start negotiations for half a dozen , and did n't tell the paynim Sancho Panza which one he really meant to purchase . The elaborate negotiationswent on day and night , and meantime Lanny collected military information and stowed it away in his mind , for he would never trust the mails of French North Africa . When the negotiations were completed , the fountain had to he taken apart and boxed piece by piece ,  | an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived so that the efficient Jerry could replace the somewhat bungling Mohammedanat this job . The family arrived , decidedly worn after four days and nights on three trains and one steamship in hot weather . Beauty had brought her Provencal maid , grandniece of her old-time cook , to take care of little Marcel ; she had also brought Madame Zyszynski , which had not been according to plan . " I just could n't bear to leave her , " the mother explained . " The Nazis have been so cruel to the Poles . It was n't such a difficult trip after I had once made up my mind to it . But the visas were hard to get . It took a lot of drag . ' " Lanny told the old woman he was delighted to see her , for to have done otherwise would have broken her heart . And besides , he could try some more experiments . Living here was going to cost the family dear , but Lanny hoped it need n't be for too long , and , as he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might lose your life . Beauty had a thousand dollars a month which Robbie 's secretary mailed to her New York bank accounton the first day of every month unless it was Sunday ; and she had sums which Lanny 's colleague , Zoltan Kertersi , kept adding to that same account for the Detaze paintings he was authorized to sell . Also , her man of God had a small income from investments he had made back in the State of Iowa ; God had protected them as per request . So they could afford four thousand francs a day at the Hotel Marnounia , and the incidental expenses which were necessary to the happiness of a one-time " professional beauty . " It did n't take them long to get settled . Beauty had never failed to find people she knew in whatever part of the world she visited , and soon she was in the " social swim , " which would n't completely stop its splashing for any wars . She was delighted with this unique Mohammedancity : the mud walls , the tall towers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Atlas Mountains . It was cold at night and hot by day ; and strolling on its streets you saw not merely all the tribes of North Africa , but refugees from all Europe , French Syria , and even Indo-China . As for Parsifal Dingle , he sat in his elegant room , sipping tea with various Mohammedan devotees who came to call , astonished and delighted to find an American gentleman taking a genuine interest in the technicalities of their Prophet 's faith . So the two parents both hadp291what they wanted ; and Lanny could only hope that his judgment had been correct , and that Marrakech was a safer place for Americans than Juan-les-Pins . He believed that the fighting in North Africa would be on the beaches , and he knew that this city of mosques and millionaires was not equipped to stand a siege , even if the French had been minded for it . Of course if the " Yanks " were repelled , the Wehrmacht would come here , but the situation would be no worse than on the Riviera . Lanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left himself free to continue the gathering of information . Also , he had a little time for play , and took Madame to his room and seated her in a well-stuffed chair , where she could rest her head back and go into one of her trances . He had decided that her powers were waning , if not entirely gone , but he had to indulge her once in a while because she had adopted him in her heart as a son and must not be made to feel that she was put away on the shelf . Perhaps it was that travel had stirred up her faculty . Whatever the reason , she gave a demonstration that reminded him of the old days . There came the familiar voice of Tecumseh , the Amerindian chieftain who said he had been an Iroquois , and much superior to the one known to history . What he actually was Lanny had never been able to decide , but he talked in character and his voice was sometimes like Madame 's , sometimes not . For thirteen years the Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice only what other people had told her ; she had never heard it in her life . " So here you are again , young man ! " boomed the " spirit . " " Where have you been keeping yourself ? " That a man of stone-age culture two centuries dead should be using modern slang was something you just had to guess about . " You ought to know as well as I , " bantered Lanny . They had reated each other in this fashion through the years . " I am not nearly so much interested in you as you are in yourself . What is it you are looking for ? " " Nothing in particular , Tecumseh . Just the pleasure of a chat with you . " You know you do n't believe in me and never will . You just want lo sit and make a lot of notes , and then what do you do with them ? " " I study them diligently , old friend . "  | " To what purpose ? A ten-year-old child would know more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such long words . " Then , abruptly : " There is a man here , a foreign fellow . He speaks English badly , word by word . Why ca n't people learn a sensible language ? I am tired of these queer ones who come crowding around you , always in trouble . " " I have lived most of my life in Europe , Tecumseh , and met all sorts of people . Ask the man his name . " " He says it is Hoo-go . Is that right ? " " I knew a man by that name . " " Is he an Indian ? He gives the name Bear . " " He is a German . They spell it B-E-H-R . I remember him well . Ask him how long he has been in the spirit world . " " He says eight years . He says he went suddenly . " " No man could go more suddenly , " declared Lanny , who held the event as one of the most vivid memories in his life . He had been drivingthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had driven up from behind , ordered Hugo out of the car , and shot him in the face , scattering his blood and brains over the pavement of a Munich street . Such things had been going on all over that city and also Berlin  --  it was part of the dreadful Blood Purge at the end of June and the beginning of July 1934 . Adolf Hitler had become Chancellor upon a program of fundamental economic reforms , and after a year and a half his most sincere followers had realized that he had sold out to the cartelmasters and had no idea of abolishing " interest slavery " or breakingup the great landed estates . Adolf Hitler was getting ready for war , and the first thing he had to do was to rid himself of those " old companions , " the Sturmabteilung men who had helped him to power and were clamoring for their reward . " National Socialists , " they had called themselves , and they wanted the " Socialist " part , while their " Adi " was going to give them only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behr had been hurled suddenly into the spirit world ; and now here he was , stammering poor English , trying to find out if Lanny Budd remembered and understood what had befallen him . Lanny answered yes to both questions , for somehow he did n't feel it necessary to continue his P.A. role in this strange limbo . Tecumseh said there were tears running down the German 's cheeks as he lamentedwhat was happening at present ; the spirits were arriving byp293the thousand every day , and it was a most dreadful calamity , the murder of a whole race , the best in the world . It was that two-front war which all the military men had held to be the one inexcusable blunder ; but Adolf Hitler , the ex-corporal or less , thought he knew more than all the trained minds of the Generalstab . " Send him over here , Lanny ! " exclaimed the SA man . " What would you do with him ? " inquired Lanny , ever curious about this mysterious half-world . But Hugo was vague , like all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some hate him , " he declared . Apparently the German limbo was one vast clamor of controversy ; all the spirits who had n't been allowed to say what they thought on earth went at it eagerly now , and the German colony was what Germany itself might be expected to be when the Germans had been beaten  --  as Hugo said they were surely going to be . When Lanny asked how he knew this , Hugo said , painfully through the mind and lips of Tecumseh , that his world was full of mentality in the same way that radio waves filled all space on earth . When Lanny asked why Hugo had n't come to him before , he said it was like the problem of finding a receiving set on earth . He said that Madame was a battery that ran down quickly , and then there was no more power . He said it two or three times : " Keine Kraft nehr , " his voice dying away . There came silence , and then a sigh from the medium , and little moans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it good ? " she asked , and Lanny told her it had been wonderful . He went off by himself to speculate , as he had been doing for years . Was there a fragment of the Hugo Behr personality floating about somewhere in space or out of space , in some universe of consciousness of which all our minds are part ? Or was this an elaborate process of fictional creation which went on in the subconscious minds of some living persons , perhaps of all ? Lanny had n't thought of Hugo Behr for a long time , and there was no special circumstance connecting him with North Africa or with Lanny 's present activities . Was this interview the product of Lanny 's own subconscious fictionizing , and had some force in the mind of Madame dipped into his mind and taken this story , which surely he had never told to her or in her presence ? Madame 's mind had tied it up with her own subconscious fictionizing , which had to do with a stone-age man from North America . Was that man made out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or picked up in some medium parlor which she had visited while in process of discoveringher own gift ?  | This much could be certain , and only this : there were forces in our minds of which we had only the vaguest notion , and these forces went on creating mindstuff , in the same way that plants went on creating plants and animals creating animals . The process never ceased while life lasted ; and whether it ceased then was a problem about which we had better keep our minds open  --  while life lasted . When the fountain had been packed and shipped , Lanny took his old friend Jerry for a walk and revealed to him the carefully guarded secret that for the past five years he had been working as a secret agent of the United States government . He was prepared to be told that his ex-tutor had guessed it , and this proved to be the case . " I never for a moment thought that you had lost interest in everything but buying paintings , Lanny . I knew it must be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . " " That 's fine , Jerry . And now here is the situation . The American Army is coming to North Africa before the end of the year , and it seems to me most unlikely that the Germans will fail to move into the Riviera . I was pretty sure you 'd rather be in American hands than in those of the Nazis . " " I guessed that , too , and I 'm very much obliged . I take it that Cerise and the children wo n't be in too great danger , for the Germans have shown that they want to conciliate the French . They 've confined their murdering and raping to the eastern front . " " Exactly so . And here 's the point : I have been authorized to pay out money to persons who are worthy of trust ; and that means you . You know the French , and you can do first-rate work as an Intelligence man . You will have to keep up the pretense that you are working for me , and I have figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half your salary out of my own funds and half out of the government 's . I do n't know what Intelligence is paying , but I can find out . Meantime , would ten dollars a day and expenses seem right to you ? " " Very handsome , indeed ; but I 've no idea how to earn it . You 'll have to tell me that . " " Do n't worry ; you 'll be kept busy . The word is that the invasion is to be this year , and we have only three months before bad weather . I will tell you as much as I have already learned , and you can start from there . It will be your job to meet people who have information , and find ways to get it out of them . Of course if you have to pay them ,  |p295that  is O.K. , and I will honor your account . My basic instruction is that we are trying to save the lives of our boys , and not to save money . The Nazis are printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want maps , we want photographs , everything of that sort . We want to know where military goods are stored , where the big guns are and their caliber , where the Germans have built their flak towers , every sort of military data . We want to know what is in the minds of the men , of the officers , the dockers , everybody . " " I 'll do my best , Lanny , but I 'm utterly lacking in experience . " " Nearly all our people are lacking , Jerry . We have to start from scratch . There will he other fellows working , and more and more of them coming . No doubt there will be a lot of duplication , but that 's all right ; what one man reports will check the next man 's . And do n't forget that wherever you go you are looking for mosaics and fountains and beautifully carved doorways  --  you are really looking for them , just as I am really buying them . If ever it happens that you get caught and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must swear that I employed you in good faith in connection with my art business , and that I have n't the slightest idea that you have been thinking about anything else . " " Sure thing , Lanny . All that goes without saying . Wild horses wo n't drag anything out of me . " " And one thing more , old man . Keep watch who is walking behind you at night , and do n't let anybody lure you into a dark alley . " So there was another secret agent , and it did n't take him long to get the hang of the job . A couple of hours questioning Lanny , and he was ready to go out and talk with Frenchmen and French-speaking natives , first about art works , then about politics and about the defenses of Casablanca . He would come back to his boss to report , and it was n't many days before he had an interesting story . " Have you been to Volubilis ? " he inquired . " No , " replied Lanny . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are much the same . " " I 've met a chap who has been studying Volubilis . He calls himself an archeologist and comes from Chicago . " " Name Faulkner ? " inquired the other . " Oh , then you know him ! "  | " I came over in the plane with him , the trip before last . Nice chap , I thought . " " Funny about him , Lanny . He 's been to Volubilis , all right , and knows all about some new excavating the French did just before the war ; but he is n't doing anything with his information so far as I can make out . ' What he does is to hang around and gossip with dockworkers. and fishermen and people like that . He seems to have no end of time to make friends . " " I guessed that he was an O.S.S. man , Jerry . Our State Department is n't letting anybody over to study ancient ruins these days . " " He picked on me because he found I had lived half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've an idea he does n't trust himself any too well . Seems shy . " " Another one who 's lacking in experience ! " remarked Lanny with a chuckle . " He 's been trying to find out everything I know , and of course I 've been trying to find out everything he knows . We had a fine time talcingin each other 's washing . " " Well , you might combine forces , once you 've made sure he 's all right . He struck me as being very much the gentleman and scholar . " " I 've a feeling that he 's about ready to open up and propose somethingof the sort . I wondered what I should say . " " Let him do the talking . Tell him you 're a patriot , of course , and would be glad to help in any way you can . But do n't tell him you 're an agent till you 're absolutely certain of him , and do n't ever let on that I know about it . Let it be that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that you could turn in your information through him , or he could put you in touch with his superior . I have to go back to New York very soon , and while I 'm gone you might come on something that was too hot to keep . " " Just what I have been worrying about ! " said Jerry Pendleton . Once a week Lanny had been writing a letter to his wife . He told her about the art works he had inspected and about the scenery and the weather ; he said that he was well , and so were the other members of the family , and that he loved her , and thought about her often , and hoped that her literary work was progressing , and that she was n't overdoingit . All that , but not a word about the war , or politics , or anythingapproaching thereto ; nor any strange words or mysterious state/ments which might excite the suspicion of a censor . Laurel , carefully warned , did the same ; she informed him that she was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she moved slowly ; she said that the weather was not troubling her ; that she had been to visit his family , and also her own people in Baltimore ; that the book was not so good as she had hoped , but she was trying to improve it . Assuming that the anonymous censor would be a human being , she had the boldness to add : " Marriage is a dreadfully bad habit ; I miss you so ! " By the beginning of October Lanny felt that he had got as heavy a load of information as he could carry in one head . It was a question of flying back to Algiers and having it delivered to the office of Mr. RobertMurphy or of taking a trip home . Really there was n't much difference , or so he told himself , and added that he could do better work if he had a chance to bring his mind up to date with that of his Chief . In the back of his head was the notion that he might win the Chief 's permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offeringto bring him a message from his most loyal secretary and friend . In addition to all this was the desire to see Laurel , although he sternly told himself that the service of the country must come first and that his personal interest must never take precedence . Of course , if he could manage to make the two kinds of interest coincide , he would be glad to see a wife whom he missed as much as she missed him . Things had worked out neatly in the matter of Jerry Pendleton . He had had a showdown with his Dr. Faulkner . ( The archeologist had a Ph.D . from the University of Chicago , but was thinking of dropping it in Morocco because the natives knew the meaning of the word " doctor , " or thought they did , and while he was measuring the dimensionsof ancient Roman dwellings they would bring him cases of trachoma to be treated and tumors to be cut out . ) Jerry had told this earnest scholar-turned-spy that he had a good salary as assistant to an art expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him in the collecting of data useful to an army . So now Jerry had a way to turn in information and have it reach headquarters promptly , for Faulkner reported to one of the vice-consuls who had a concealed radio-sending set . Lanny gave Jerry several items which might be urgent , and Faulknerwould get the credit for these and of course be made happy . This arrangement set Lanny free to take wing with a good conscience . His procedure was to cable Robbie that he was ready to come home . A message to his father on such a subject would seem natural to any enemy agent who might have bought or exacted the right to inspect cablegrams out of French Morocco . Robbie would pass on the word to a man in Washington , about whom he knew nothing except the name , Baker , and a telephone number . The result was that a couple of days later a messenger from the consulate called at Lanny 's hotel , informinghim that a place had been reserved for him on the plane from Tangier to Lisbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of the Azores and Bermuda . So " Traveler " packed his belongings , leaving a bundle of summer clothing in his mother 's care , it being no longer summer in New York . He wrote a few letters having to do with the business of art , letters which he wanted to come from Marrakech for the effect upon the clients , and also because he wanted censors and enemy agents to have a chance to read them . He bade good-by to the friends he had made and took a dilapidated train into Spanish Morocco . Two days later he went on board one of those luxurious flying boats that have nearly all the American comforts . It was shoved off from the Lisbon pier , its propellersbegan to whirl , and it went racing down the River Tagus . The waves slapped its underside , shaking it , and presently there were no more slaps and it was airborne , heading into the west , a crossing which in I492 had taken the little caravels of Columbus a matter of seventy days , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a day . Such a difference when two numbers exchanged positions ! This flying boat was playing safe , and stopped at the Islands of the Green Cape , which the bold navigators of Portugal had taken long ago and which now the timid dictator of Portugal had rented to the Allies for a high price to save them the embarrassment of having to seize them . From there on to the still-vexed Bermoothes , which now had become an American naval and air station , to the embarrassment of staid citizens who had hitherto refused to recognize the existence of motorcars . Lanny 's baggage was politely searched by the British authorities , also his clothing . He held his breath , wondering if they were going to find those two scraps of paper sewed up in the lining of his coat , scraps which were so oddly contradictory in their content ! But the search was not that thorough , and whatever the name of Budd meant to the officials they gave no sign . The Clipper was put down on the water of Long Island Sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first act was to step into a telephone booth . He had been debating , in the words of ap299poem which schoolchildren learn : " Which shall it be ? Which shall it be ? " He had decided for duty instead of love ; but as it happened , duty 's telephone line was busy , so love had its chance . He heard the dear familiar voice and said : " Here I am , safe and sound ! " She cried : " Oh , Lanny ! Lanny ! " There was a catch in her voice . " Everything 's jake ! " he told her , " and I 'll be home in an hour . Do n't make any preparations , for I may be flying to Washington today . " Such was the fate of a P.A. 's wife , who did n't even know what a P.A. was ! He telephoned Baker and was told as usual to call back in three hours for an appointment . Then to a taxi , and in due course he greeted the familiar elevator girl  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her a dollar bill so that she would be as glad to see him as he was to see her . He had left his key to the apartment with Laurel , so he had to ring the bell . Here she came , and what a spectacle ! The bright eager face was the same , but the rest of her so different ! He took her gently in his arms and told her it was grand and that he was tickled to death , and so on , and of course he was . Thirteen years had passed since he had been through this same experience . Irma had been brought up in smart society , where the young women of the twenties had done what they damn pleased and said it in that and other four-letter words . But Laurel had come of a Southern family and was old-fashioned in spite of calling herself a Socialist and feminist . She blushed when she saw her husband glance at that large protuberance , and as they sat on the couch , his arms about her , oldfashionedtears of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Oh , do for God 's sake get this awful war over ! I ca n't stand it much longer ! " She had almost three years more of it yet to stand ; but her husband did n't know that and could n't tell her . The wisest men in the world could have given her only their guesses  --  " all different and no two alike ! "  |p302ROOSEVELT  was at " Shangri-La , " and Lanny was told to be there the following evening . This suited him well , giving him a chance to see his wife , and also to have Robbie send in a car . He had a lot of fun preparing a supper in that " kitchenette , " smaller than anything he had seen in his amply spaced life . The process was retarded by his stopping every two or three minutes to kiss his wife , and tell her how glad he was to get home , and how he hoped to stay at least a week . A woman expecting the ordeal of motherhood has to be absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not show any signs of irritation or impatience or other characteristics which the male animal so distressingly develops . Lanny laughed a lot and romped a little and cheered her up before the meal , and while they were eating he told her stories about a strange part of the world which she had never seen . Afterward he settled down in an easy chair to read three months ' production of manuscript  --  another kind of baby in process of gestation . It was a much better baby than she had led him to expect , so he was able to tell her , and that made his homecoming a complete success . In the morning he went down to see Mr. Post , to make sure whether or not any of those German agents in the hoosegow had given any indicationof laying the blame upon the son of Budd-Erling . He was assured that they had not ; they had swallowed the story of the diamonddropped in the street , and since they had no chance to communicateone with another , they were left to lay the blame each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over to his own government , and what they had done with him was something that might not be known till the end of the war . The son of Budd-Erling said : " O.K. by me ! " The car was brought to the door , and Lanny packed a bag and took his warm overcoat , prepared for an October evening in the Catoctin Mountains . He drove the familiar hundred miles on crowded Highway Number 1 , and then the same distance through the lovely farmlandsp303of Maryland , where all the trees by the roadside and along the hillslopeshad put on their brightest autumn colors , which were really a burial shroud for that year 's departing glory . Sudden gusts of wind brought the leaves down upon the car and over the roadway. " 0 wild West Wind , thou breath of Autumn 's being " ! Toward sundown , approaching the little town of Thurmont , Lanny stopped and got supper , then drove into the town , parked and locked his car , and was picked up by Baker in the usual way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years , and winding up the mountain road with the car lights wandering here and there over vistas of trees , they talked about the war , the past , not the future . They agreed that the Russians were fighting like tigers , and the Americans were holding on marvelously in the Solomons . " How they can hit a ship ten miles away in darkness is certainly a miracle , " said Baker , and Lanny contented himself with commenting : " It must be a new invention . " Maybe the President 's man had heard the magic word radar and maybe he had n't ; in any case , Lanny would n't speak it . Some of the " brass " had been consulting with the President , and they had stayed for dinner , so Lanny had to wait . He sat in the entrancehall and chatted with a young lieutenant ; neither of them said what he was there for , but they talked about the war in the quiet professionalway of men who were taking part in a job and neither hated nor loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Nobody would show fear , nobody would show horror , and grief only in extreme cases , and for a few moments . Millions of men were trying to live up to those standards , and most of them succeeded ; the few who could n't were no longer called white-livered cowards , but were spoken of professionallyas " shock " cases . F.D.R. was sitting in an easy chair in front of a log fire , welcome in this mountain climate . His wheel chair had been placed out of sight , and when he desired to move he pressed a button attached to a cord and hung on the arm of his chair ; the attendant would bring up he wheel chair , and the President with his powerful arms and shoulders would lift himself from one to the other . That was the way he got about , except when he wore the steel leg braces , which were heavy and which hurt . With such a handicap , he carried the burden of a nation 's destiny  --  indeed it would not be too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face never failed to light up when he saw a friend ; he made every friend feel , just as Lanny felt , that it was a special happiness . Few men gave themselves more freely to friends , or got so much from them . " Welcome , world traveler ! " he exclaimed , and with his large hand outstretched he shook Lanny 's hand and then sort of guided him to a chair alongside . " I received all your reports , and read them , and they helped me . " " That 's what a P.A. lives by , " returned Lanny . " I had an easy time . I took your advice and kept out of danger . My conscience troubles me , Governor . " " Do n't let it . You are under orders , and that is enough for you . " " Theirs not to reason why ! ' " quoted the agent . " You are to do but not to die , " retorted the Boss , who was quick on the uptake . " Now tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come ashore ? " " They will get a mixed reception , Governor , different in different places , depending on the commanding officer , and on subordinates who may or may not obey completely . Some will join us , others will wait to see what happens ; some will fight , at least until their sense of honor is satisfied . That means a great deal to a Frenchman , you know . " " How many of their men have to be killed before their honor feels satisfied ? " " There seems to be no schedule set . General Nogues , in Morocco , is more determined on resistance than any of the officers in Algiers , many of whom have been deprived of command and are out of uniform . You understand , there are such things as salaries and pensions , and army officers have to eat like all other men . " " That is why we are sending seven divisions , Lanny . " " If you send that many , and if the officers know it for sure , their honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy will fight harder than the Army . You know that their officers are as a rule much more conservative ; they have their own little world , and they rule it by divine authority . " " Indeed I know it , Lanny . I have some Navy officers of my own , and you should hear the ideas they put before me ! " The confidential agent was subjected to a long inquisition as to Vichy and Toulon , Switzerland and Germany . There were many things that Lanny had n't been willing to put on paper , and now he toldp305them . In general he had only good things to report about American officials abroad , and an overworked administrator was glad to hear that ; he received mostly complaints , he said , and it was so hard to find competent men for unfamiliar jobs . So many thousands of things to be administered and to think about and try to understand ! The lines of care showed in the once-so-jovial face ; his hair was growing thinner , and age was creeping on him noticeably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , or heard one , such as that about the stage queen of Germany manifesting her tender sympathy for a Jew in distress . Lanny had not written an account of his interview with Hess , for there was no war information in it . But it was the kind of story that gave Roosevelt delight , and Lanny had a purpose in telling it fully . He showed the ring and the scrap of paper , which he had unsewed from his coat for this occasion . He left it for the other to ask : " What do you expect to do with that ? " " I am hoping , Governor , that I can persuade you to let me go into Germany . If I should write Hitler from Switzerland that I have had an interview with his most trusted friend , he would surely invite me to come and would probably send a plane to Friedrichshafen or some other place at the Swiss border to take me . " The President 's face became suddenly grave . " What would you expect to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to know in advance . I have a feeling that I can tell a lot by looking at Hitler , listening to his voice , and watching his manner . He is a reckless talker , and when he gets going , nobody can predict what he will say . He will ask me what I have been doing to help him bring peace to Europe , and I will tell him , and he will tell me what proposals he wants me to take to the Wickthorpe set and to Henry Ford and Mr. Hearst and the others he believes are his friends here . " " But we do n't care a damn about any of that , Lanny . We are going to knock him out and not argue with him . " " Yes , Governor , but you say you want to save lives ; and if you know what is in your opponent 's mind , it is easier to figure out how to break him . I have never met Hitler that I did n't come away with valuableinformation , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer have any contacts with him and hardly know what anybody in Germany is thinking . " " But they would watch you like a skyful of buzzards . Nobody would talk frankly to you or peril of his life . Do you imagine for a moment that you could gr. about in Germany as you used to do ?  |p306What  's in the back of your mind , to trf , ke contact with some atomic physicist ? " " I just ca n't be sure , Governor . I would have to watch for my chances and take them . " " And walk into some trap they had set for you ! If any person came to you , even an old friend , pretending to be a sympathizer , that would certainly be a plant . " There was a moment 's pause , and then the President burst out : " I do n't want you to do it , Lanny ! I need your services too much to risk them in harebrained adventures . And besides , I have something else for you to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with your father and have him cable you to return . " " Well , of course , Governor , if that 's the situation , there 's nothing for me to do but forget my little scheme . " " Our North Africa expedition is all but ready . I do n't know the exact date  --  it depends upon winds and other factors  --  but our armada should be at sea in a fortnight or so . " " That 's big news indeed , Governor ! " " You bet your life ! And behind it is the biggest story of human labor in all this world , I believe . Some day when we have more time , remind me and I 'll tell you what was going on the last time you were in this building . Winston had just told me the terrible news that Rommelhad succeeded in trapping and destroying the greater part of the British tank forces at El Alamein , and the British were almost helpless to defend Alexandria and Cairo . It was just a question of days before Rommel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked : What could we do ? ' " " What did we do ? " Lanny knew this overworked great man , who was still part boy ; he wanted to tell a story , even though there was n't time . " We had just got our new tank-killer in production , a 105 mm. gun , self-propelled , mounted on an M-3 tank chassis ; it can do thirty-five miles an hour and hit a target at seven miles . We sent out telegrams to plants all over this land where guns and carriages and engines and parts were being made , and men and women gave up their Fourth of July week end and worked ten-hour shifts , two a day , and foremen and superintendentsworked eighteen-hour shifts , living on sandwiches and soda pop and sleeping in the plants . Believe it or not , in nine days we had enough destroyers and tanks at the docks to fill a whole convoy , and the stevedores worked day and night to load them . Those vessels sailed around South Africa and the subs got only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important of all , we sent more telegramsp307and the factories duplicated their feat ; we put the stuff on a fast vessel that traveled alone and reached the convoy before it got round the Cape of Good Hope . General Alexander has everything he needs now , and if you 're watching the news you know that Rommel is a cooked goose . " " I 'm glad to hear you say it , Governor . Remember , I 've been getting mostly Axis news . " " People for the most part judge military situations by advances and retreats . But in that Egyptian desert there has been desperate fighting for weeks , and we are satisfied with the fact that Rommel has been nailed down . We are pouring more stuff to the Eighth Army all the time , and we do n't know when Alexander will be ready for his push , but I 'll bet on his not waiting after we land in the west . " Lanny had come to understand this genial man well after five years of service . It was possible to divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lanny might have heard a collection of inside stories , just by dropping hints ; for example , by saying a word or two in praise of American labor . F.D.R. , an aristocrat by upbringing and temperament , loved labor , and it was n't just politics ; he idealized labor , imagined the best about it , called for the best from it , and got that . Lanny had the same attitude , and would have enjoyed an evening hearing about miraclesbeing wrought by miners and steelworkers , builders of ships and guns and planes and every one of the quarter-million items which were on the purchasing lists of the U.S.A. , the U.S.N. , and the U.S.M.C.But one of the ways by which the son of Budd-Erling had kept his favor at this court was by being considerate and never wearing out his welcome . So now he said : " Governor , I have no right to keep you from your job . Tell me what mine is . " " We are going to send out the greatest flotilla of ships in all history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds , some of them never seen in the world before , built especially for this occasion . We are going to take Casablanca on the Atlantic coast and Oran and Algierson the Mediterranean . We would like to take Tunis , but we are afraid to come that close to Italy and the German airfleets . Our ships of all sorts will have to lie off the ports for several days while men and cargo are being put ashore ; and we wo n't have any land-based aviation , withthe single exception of me base at Gibraltar which the enemy could knock out in an lion , . if they knew what we were doing . It 's a tough situation , and I lie awake nights thinking about the German U-boats . You know how they will gather , a hundred of them at least , and with all the defenses we can muster we sha n't be able to keep them from getting at our ships . " " I 'm afraid not , Governor . " " A horrible thing to think of those loaded transports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a small part of the troops . My heart aches for those boys , Lanny , and I have racked my brains trying to figure out a way to protect them . I have discussed it with everybody who might have suggestions , and it comes down to this : we have to find a way to make the enemy think we are coming to Dakar . That is the one port we are not coming to , because it is too far away from the Mediterranean ; but it should be easy to make the Germans think its our objective because it 's nearest to us and would be impossible for them to reinforce . They are very contemptuous of us and would expect us to distrust our own powers . " " Yes , Governor . I have heard much talk of Dakar among the French and reports of it among the Germans . " " All right . We want to have their wolfpacks gathering off the peanutcoast , while our armada is a couple of thousand miles to the north . I wo n't be satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certaintyin the minds of the German command that Dakar is our goal . I 've tried to recall all the spy stories I 've ever read , and I 've invented some new ones , but none is good enough . Somebody will have to get some German drunk  --  what 's the fellow 's name , their head diplomatic agent ? " " Theodor Auer . " " Do you know him ? " " I have seen him . He 's somewhat halfhearted about the Nazis , I 'm told . He not only gets drunk , but he 's a homo . " " Well , some American might get drunk with him and spill the secret . Somebody might be selling out , or some document might be stolen ; somehow or other Herr Auer must be convinced that he has the inside dope , that Dakar is the goal . Of course the Germans know that we are preparing a fleet , and we can hardly hope to keep their spies from finding out that it is sailing and then their getting a wirelessmessage across . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny . There was quailing in his heart , but he would n't for the whole world have let any sign of it appear . Keep a stiff upper lip ! " I discussed the matter with Alston a few days ago , and he sug/gested it might be a job for you . I do n't mean that you personally should do it , but find the right man and work out the right device . You know the Germans better than we do , and you know the ground . " Lanny was thinking hard . " Listen , Governor , " he said ; " why can not your plan be dovetailed into mine ? What 's the matter with my going into Germany right quick and telling Adi himself what I have learned ? " " Would he believe you ? " " I ca n't be sure , but I have manage &; to make him believe everything I have told him so far . " F.D.R. knitted his brows over that one . " I thought you told me he was bound to have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . But after my talk with Hess I believe I could get away with anything . I could tell the Fuhrer that I talked with Stalin in order to come and report to him what Stalin said . Hitler has known for many years that I have an uncle who is a Communist , and it would be a conceivablething for me to use that Red connection as a part of my serviceto the Nazi cause . He knows who my father is , too , but that has not kept him from believing that I am a Nazi devotee . " " And how would you get out of Germany ? " " I would get out the same way I had got in ; Hitler would send me , with important messages for this one and that . " " But suppose he had his doubts , and suppose he were to offer some polite pretext for keeping you in Germany until after the landings in North Africa had taken place ? " " That would be awkward , I admit . " " You would die by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those tiny glass capsules which Professor Alston gave me the last time he ordered me into Germany . It would be one life for many thousands , and , as wars go , that 's a good bargain . " " It just so happens that I want to keep you , Lanny . I need you in North Africa after the invasion , to watch how things are going and give me the straight dope . Later on , perhaps , I 'll be willing to consider your idea , but now I want you to return , as fast as you can , to Casablanca , or to Algiers as you think best . And I want you to find some way to get this job done without risking your life . There are plenty of men to do the fighting and dying ; when I have one whom I have tried and tested , who has special knowledge and whose judgment I trust , such a man is not expendable . Your orders are to take care of your life and your health , and come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " O.K. , Governor , " said the P.A. , " and thanks for the compliment . My wife will appreciate it even more than I do ! " Lanny drove to Washington that night , and when he tried to find a hotel he was told that people were sleeping in the chairs of the lobbies , and he could see it . Simpler to him appeared to be a parking lot for his car ; he locked himself in and slept fairly well . The war was doing a lot of things to America . Families by the million were being uprooted or lured away to new places  --  the shipyards , the airplane plants , the factorieswhere the war goods were being made and the biz wages paid . People were living in their cars , in trailers , in made-over sheds and chickenhouses , anything that would keep off the rain . They were eatingwhatever they could find . Meats and fats , canned goods and sugar , were rationed . You went shopping with little books , one for each member of the family ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of tiny red and blue disks . F.D.R. had suggested that Lanny should consult with Colonel Donovan , and so he spent the morning with that outfit . C.O.I. had been their initials , but now they were O.S.S.  --  Office of Strategic Services . They had a wonderful machine that made a record of what you said on a thin wire which rolled off one spool and onto another ; that could be run again and again , without limit . Lanny told them all he had learned in the places he had visited , and answered half a hundred questions . In return he asked a few , and one had to do with that young Dr. Faulkner . In the public library in New York , Lanny had looked in the Chicago University catalogue and had found him there ; now the O.S.S. men said that he was all right and a capable fellow . They offered Lanny a letter to him , but Lanny said he did n't carry letters and was sure that he could arrange what he wanted , or rather , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and they fell in therewith . They all showed respect for the son of Budd-Erling , for most of them were tyros , whereas Lanny had been on the job for years . All the way to Washington he had been making up spy stories , and all the way to New York he was trying them out in his mind . Always the villain of the story was Herr Theodor Auer , and the hero was sometimes Lanny himself , sometimes the director of a travel bureau in Cannes , and sometimes an innocent-appearing archeologist from the Windy City , the Hog Butcher of the World . Many of them werep311fantastic stories ; but , try as he might , their creator would never produceone too fantastic to happen since the rise of Nazi-Fascism . The quarter century between the years 1920 and 1945 would become the reservoir and repository of all melodramas and movie plots , spy stories , murder mysteries , crime-and-punishment fiction , to the end of time . " Cloak and dagger boys , " the wits of New York had dubbed the Donovan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . They had all read and written so many stories that it was hard for them to believe that fiction had suddenly become reality , and that they were in it . Lanny told them : " The first one of you who falls into hands of the Nazis will learn that there is nothing funny about it . " They answered gravely : " It has already happened , Budd . " Back in the great crowded city , Lanny told his wife the bad news . it He had only two days and a half with her ; his plane reservation had been made and his ticket and passport would be delivered to him . Hesaw Laurel go pale and then clench her hands and set her lips together . She had promised him , and promised herself , that she would nevermake things harder for him . Over and over again , she repeated it. 1 " Darling , " he said , " I truly wanted to be with you at your confinement , but I have no choice in the matter . I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can guess it , " she replied . " All I can do is to hope and pray foryou. " it " It will comfort you to know that one of my orders is to live . When the shooting starts , I am to be in the background . I am one of those important persons who are not expendable . ' " " Well , Lanny "  --  she tried to force a smile  --  " do your best to obey that order . If I get a telegram , my heart will stop beating . " " You have your job , dear , a double one . Do n't you think you had better go and let Robbie and Esther take care of you while you have the baby ? " " I have my doctor , and my hospital arrangements are made . Agnes will be here to take care of me when I come home , and the baby will have your room until you come home again . How long will it be ? " " My orders are to return every two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it two . It depends upon events of which nobody in the world can know the outcome . You will read it in the papers . " " I have my guesses , Lanny , but I know that it would n't be proper to ask . I want you to know that I have n't any trace of hurt feelings ; I realize fully that if all the wives knew , the enemy would know a lot more quickly . Be sure that I am with you heart and soul . I know that this Nazi horror has to be destroyed , and I would risk my life for the task if it would do any good . " " You did risk it , dear , " he told her . " And do n't forget that your stories about the Nazis have been read by hundreds of thousands of people , and they now have a better understanding of the enemy as a result , and are more willing to stand by the government and make the necessary sacrifices . Knowledge has its way of spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind are slow , but they happen , and we wake up and discover that we are in a new era before we thought possible . " " God grant that we get out of this one quickly ! " exclaimed the author of The Herrenvolk . She was in her last month and had made up her mind not to go out in public any more except for a stroll with her woman friend in the evening . But now her time with Lanny was so short that she decided to throw out her old-fashioned notions and permit small portions of mankind to see her in what was known as an " interesting condition . " She put a maternity cape about her and went down to the car . She let Lanny drive her to Newcastle , where they had dinner with members of the family . Lanny spent an evening talking with his father and his two half-brothers , telling them things that would be useful to them in the turning out of faster and more deadly fighter planes . Meantime Laurel absorbed the wisdom of the Budd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their experiences and conclusions , but unfortunatelythey did not agree . The couple spent the night in the Budd home , and in the morning , drove to the estate of Lanny 's client Mr. Vernon . It was always important to have more commissions and keep up his camouflage . When the client learned that the wife was sitting in the car , he of course wanted her to come in , but Lanny explained that her condition was too interesting ; so a well-bred gentleman kept away and parted with his art expert inside the house . Thus people of the old school avoided getting uncomfortably close to the facts of life and left it for the younger generation to work out a better technique if it could.  |p313They  had lunch in a roadside tavern , and afterward the wife had a nap in the car while the husband read . Then they drove to Mr. Winstead'splace , and Lanny reported to him on art works he had come upon . They saw beautiful country estates , which gave the impression that America was a most delightful place to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that impression from the cinema screen , and dreamed of some day coming to this land of peace and plenty . The couple knew that there was another side to the picture , but on this brief holiday they were content to feast their eyes upon the colors of October landscapes , and the hedgerows and beautifully tended lawns of " show places . " Laurel had been hoping to finish her novel before the baby 's arrival , but the work had grown beyond her original conception . She was telling the story of an American girl , daughter of a college professor who had received his Ph.D . in Germany , and the daughter went there to follow in his footsteps . She became a boarder in the home of a German professor whose son and daughter had been brought up in the Hitler Youth movement . The drama of the story lay in the contrast between the old Germany and the new , as it was revealed bit by bit to an American girl . The German lad fell in love with her and expected her to behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't ; instead she argued with him , and not merely about sex , but about the true meaning of freedom and about the dignity of the individual soul . The Nazi had never heard of such ideas , but was tempted by them , and the result was a split personality ; he was no longer sure what he believed , or what he wished to do with his life . His sister , a Hitler fanatic , raged at the American , and the father looked upon this domestic strife with only one thought in his mind , that if he were to speak some indiscreet word , his daughter might betray him and he would lose his position , to say nothing of being shipped to a concentration camp . The end of all this would be the tragic breakdown and suicide of the German lad . It would he a grueling thing to write , and Lanny , who was no artist himself but had watched Rick in the throes of creation , tried to persuade his wife that the baby came first , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fully recovered , and by that time she might find that she had a clearer vision of it and new forces to record it . Meanwhile they spent their spare time going over the manuscript . There was nobody Laurel could find who knew the Nazi system  --  body , soul , and mind  --  better than her husband , and he answered her questions and gave her the little details which are revealing and are not always easy to find in the books . It was going to be a real novel when it was done . The holiday was over , and the P.A. boarded another Clipper . Men were flying back and forth across all the oceans and the continents , and no longer thought anything of it ; they read the papers , played pinochle , or swapped stories . Lanny looked out of the window , to where the wrinkled sea beneath him crawled ; he thought again what a great quantity there was of it , and how in this war crisis men were beginning to take the mineral treasures out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Langley of the Smithsonian Institution , who a half century ago had worked out the mathematical problems of flight and had constructed a machine in conformity therewith ; something had gone wrong with the launching , and the machine had plunged into the Potomac River amid the laughter of the world . Some six years ago Alfred Pomeroy-Nielson had been learning to fly , and had mentioned how monotonous it was , going round and round in the air to make up his required number of hours ; his father had been moved to construct a couplet addressed to Samuel Langley : A mighty dream you dreamed , your hopes were mocked by a swinish crew ; And now young men of fashion are bored , aloft with nothing to do . There came a cry from one of the passengers who was looking down toward the sea and pointing . Everybody rushed to the windows of the plane , and there on the wrinkled sunlit sea was a long thin shape , longer and thinner than any cigar ever made . Great excitement , for it was bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the U-boat was taking no chances on that ; already it was diving , and in a fraction of a minute there was nothing but a streak of foam on the water . TJe apparition caused much excitement , and the passengers talked subs , the damage they were doing and the remedies against them , for hours thereafter . The Clipper would radio the position of the sub , but no one on board would know the outcome . Most of the time Lanny Budd sat with his eyes shut , pretending to be sleeping , but thinking spy stories as hard as he could . There were so many , and each might succeed , but again it might fail , and to estimatethe chances of them all would have required the services ofp315Samuel Langley or perhaps of Albert Einstein . Lanny wanted help , and when he arrived at " Casa " by train from Tangier , he got a hotel room and set out without an hour 's delay to find the dependable Pendleton . They took a walk into the suburbs , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the G.I. 's would be swarming . Lanny said : " I promised to keep you busy , Jerry , and here it is . " He told the story from beginning to end , because the time was short and somebody had to be trusted . " This comes straight from the President , and he told me it would be the most important thing he had ever put up to me . I do n't want to appear in connection with it , because I have an idea of getting permission to go into Germany later on , and I do n't want the Germans here to spot me as an agent . I was told to find somebody , and tag , you 're it ! " Lanny began telling one of the spy stories he had thought up all the way from Shangri-La to Washington to New York to Casablanca . In the first place , Jerry was to go to Dr. Faulkner and speak the word " Tutor . " Lanny had fixed it up with the right man in O.S.S. that Faulkner was to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that when " Tutor " appeared , he was to drop his other work and follow orders . The next thing , Faulkner was to arrange with the vice-consul to fire him , Faulkner , in disgrace ; the vice-consul would tell his friends that the Chicago doctor was no better than a Nazi , that he had spoken with contempt of the New Deal and its founder , and had declared that the American agents in North Africa were a bunch of Communists and Jews . Faulkner would make such statements to the people he knew , and would move into a cheap lodging , saying that he was broke and that he had been shamefully mistreated . " What I am figuring , " explained Lanny , " is that before many hours have passed the Germans will have this story , and somebody will approachFaulkner and sound him out . He will be in the dumps , and will pretend to get drunk with the German  --  " " Look , Lanny , " put in the other . " This is a very moral young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt if he has ever been drunk in his life . He would pass out cold before one of the Germans got started . " " All right , let him do what he can ; let him be on the verge of suicide , and some Nazi will come to cheer him up . "  | " They have already made his acquaintance , and he has a couple who try to pump him now and then . " " All right then , that is time saved . We have only two or three weeks to work in . But wait for them to come to Faulkner ; do n't let him go after them . They give him money and he starts giving them secrets . We 'll have to work this out carefully , because they must be real things he gives , things that wo n't do us too much harm , but that will convince the enemy he still has a pipeline into the consulate . He will have an old codebook that he will sell to the Germans , and the vice-consul will send some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and decipher them , and they will be in heaven . " " For Pete 's sake , Lanny , " said the ex-tutor , " did you dream this , or did you get it out of E. Phillips Oppenheim or Sherlock Holmes ? " " That 's what the cloak-and-dagger boys are forever asking themselves . They say : Is this Washington , or is it Ruritania ? ' The joke of it is , they really are working a number of schemes that came out of spy stories . And why not ? The mystery writers spend a lot of brainwork thinking up devices , and they have to be plausible or the editor would say N.G. ' I 've no doubt that some crime editor will say that this one of mine is an old one . All I know is , I thought it up driving to Washingtonjust after my talk with F.D.R. If you can think of a better one , I 'll be glad . Meantime I told the O.S.S. that if the vice-consul radios the words : Send transfer , ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Faulkner will sell one of them to the Germans at a good price . The vice-consul will send some messages in that code , and the O.S.S. will understand that these messages are phony . They will mention things that the Germans already know , and a lot of other things that would do harm , only they will deal with the future and wo n't come off . Does this sound too crazy to you , Jerry ? " " No , but it 's complicated , and will take a gosh-awful lot of plan-ning . " " Well , you asked for it . Everything in war takes planning , and we have to do more of it and better than the enemy . The O.S.S. fellows gave it their O.K. , but it 's understood that you and Faulkner are to do the job , and you 're to be guided by circumstances always . That 's the way they 're working , each team is an individual unit and has a code name . This is Operation Tutor ; I figured that nobody would know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm hoping to keep out of it . I 'll probably be in Algiers when the invasion comes off . I told the O.S.S. people what I knew about you , and they are taking my word . "  | " Thanks , Lanny , and I 'll try my best not to let you down . Do I understand that we 're to plant the Dakar idea by means of these radio messages ? " " I would say that you should be guided by circumstances . You can begin to talk about Dakar , orders for Dakar , secret agents to be sent to Dakar , and so on . Or maybe that would be too obvious , the Germans would think that we would never name the place , even in code . The real name of the operation is Torch ; but let us invent an imaginary name , say , Operation Cornucopia . Let 's talk about that in the fake code ; keep talking about it , and the Nazis will all be saying : Cornucopia , what is Cornucopia ? ' They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will charge them a good price , so that they 'll think they are getting something , and he will come to them in triumph , telling them that Cornucopia is the invasion of Dakar . He will offer to find out the sailing date , and when he gives it to them it will be the correct date . It will have to be , not merely because we could n't keep secret the sailing of such an immense convoy , but because we want their U-boats to be gathering near Dakar at the very time that we are making our landings . The distances from our ports are about the same . " " Lanny , I believe you have it ! " exclaimed the ex-tutor . " I 'll get after Faulkner right away . Do you want to meet him ? " " Not if I can avoid it . And it will be better if you are not seen in public with Faulkner , because you are known as my man . You may be one of those who tell the world that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nazi for your taste . " " If he stands for that he 'll be a game kid , " opined Jerry Pendleton . As it turned out , the young archeologist was game . He was , according to the travel-bureau man , a sensitive and romantic soul , scared to death by the job into which he had been dropped , but at the same time thrilled to death by the excitement of it . How he would manage to survive this double death was a problem , said Jerry with a grin . " When I said to him , I am Tutor , ' it was as if I had said , I am Jesus Christ , ' or at the very least General Marshall . ' He listened to the program as if he were four years old and it was the story of the Three Bears . He has a capable mind ; I made him recite it all over to me , and he did n't miss any details . He 's gone to talk it over with the new vice-consul . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Strickland. "  | " But Strickland has been here for some time ! " " He 's still called new . ' There 's a funny situation here , as Faulkner explains it . There was a complete consular outfit in Casablanca , under the jurisdiction of the American Legation in the international zone of Tangier . They were all career men , and did the regular things that consuls and their clerks do  --  issuing visas , putting stamps on bills of lading , telling unfortunate refugees why they ca n't get into America . Then we made a deal with Vichy France to let French North Africa have a certain minimum of oil and other supplies . You know about that , no doubt ? " " There 's bitter criticism of it at home , I found . " " People do n't understand ; the agreement gives us the right to overseethe distribution of the stuff , and so the gates are wide open to our underground work . During the past year all kinds of mysterious new consular employees have been appearing , not taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and doing things that scare their nominal superiors out of their wits . Faulkner says the old vice-consul begs him to keep quiet , to keep out of sight , not to let the Germans get any idea of what they are up to . He 's afraid the Germans will demand that the French order us out of the country . General Nogues sends for the charge d'affaires at Tangier and complains , and how can a mere charge stand up to a general with a front covering of medals ? " " How does he ? " " He promises , but ca n't keep the promises , because the agents have their orders from higher up . Under the trade agreement they have a right to go anywhere in the country ; and besides that , under the treaty between the French government and the Moors , the Sultan has a semi-independent status and he can let us in here if he wishes . " " I know about that , Jerry . But take my advice and do n't trust any of the Moors . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top . " " Quite so ; but recently it has begun to get through their heads that that might be us . I have been surprised at how the news seems to be spreading ; everybody has heard that the Americans are coming , and soon . The Germans are bound to know it . " " Yes , Jerry , but they have no means of being sure . They know what rumors are , they have been in the business of spreading them wholesale years before the war actually started . They would take it for granted that if we meant to take Dakar , we would be doing everything in our power to spread the idea that we were coming to Casablanca and Algiers . "   " On that theory it might be well for me to talk Casablanca out loud . " " Why not ? " replied the P.A. " The more openly they hear it talked , the more certain they will be that the truth must be something dif-ferent . " Lanny spent the next three days with Hajek , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had become rather tired . Now and then he would excuse himself  --  he had told the Mohammedan scholar that he had a lady friend , and this gave him the right to be secretive . The " lady " wore trousers , American fashion , and Lanny would go to her room , making sure that he was not being followed , and Jerry Pendletonwould lock the door and tell him in whispers the latest developments in their conspiracy . The call for the codebooks had been sent and acknowledged , and Mr. Strickland , the " new " vice-consul , would get these by air pouch . Meantime the young archeologist had retired to his " doghouse , " where Jerry saw him only by night , and after the most elaborate precautions . The story of his disgrace was all over the bazaars . Hajek brought it to Lanny , and that was one of the tests . Lanny played the role of incredulity , and the dark brown man assured him solemnly that " all Morocco " knew it . Then Hajek wanted to know if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moors had got along very well with the large Jewish population along the North African coast , and only now , under the steady pressure of Nazi propaganda , were beginning to realize that the Jews were much better traders than the Moors , and had perhaps been accumulating more than their share of money , land , and business . Lanny said , as he had said a thousand times during his secret career : " Such matters do not concern me . I am interested in art values , which are not subject to the influence of wars and political changes . " Lanny 's guess that the Germans would not overlook the bait which Faulkner had set before them proved to be correct . First to come to the disgraced archeologist was an Austrian refugee artist who had struck up an acquaintance with him some time ago . Now he came as to a friend in misfortune , and it speedily developed that he was n't a refugeeat all , that was camouflage . He fished around to find out how bitter Herr Faulkner was , and Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had made an offer to relieve the American 's financial distress , and next day he brought a bull-necked and shaven-headed Prussian with him to the " doghouse , " obviously so that an important Nazi might sound out the American renegade and judge what he was worth . Faulkner told some of the secrets of the consulate , and his offer to furnish one of the codebooks , now being used , for the sum of fifty thousand francs , less than five hundred dollars , certainly seemed moderate . The books had come promptly , and Jerry brought Lanny a list of messages which were to be sent to Washington in this stolen code . Jerry , Faulkner , and the vice-consul had worked out the messages , and some were true and some false . For example , they would say that the freighter Lucy J which had just sailed for Halifax was in reality bound for Sydney ; that was n't so , but the Germans would n't have any way of knowing it for a couple of weeks . On the other hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and must have more at once was true , and must have been known to the enemy without any code . The statement that the agent Faulkner had been dischargedfor insubordination and indiscreet talk , and that he was now being closely watched to find out the reason for his meeting with Germans , would afford the Germans some amusement , and they would warn Faulkner and thus provide a check on the code . Every word of these messages had to be studied carefully , and every item of informationgiven to the enemy had to be weighed for its cost as against the greater gain hoped to be collected . There was a lot in the messages about Operation Cornet ( the name had had to be changed because there was no " Cornucopia " in the code book ) . The town was full of rumors about Operation Cornet , the Germans were doing their best to find out about Operation Cornet and had tried to get consulate clerks in their pay  --  and this was all true . The consulate begged to be informed of the date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler recently returned from the site of Operation Cornet expressed the opinion that it would cost a full division in casualties , and that it could not be undertaken with fewer than four divisions ; and so on . The conspiracy was going smoothly , and Lanny thought that the farther away from it he was , the better . The longer he stayed in Casablanca , now a spy center almost as active as Lisbon , the more he would draw attention to himself and cause the Germans to wonder if he had anything to do with this and that . So he hired the same charcoal-P321powered car as before , and had himself and his Hajek driven to Marrakech . Delightful weather there , with sunshine rarely ceasing , and the immensely high Atlas Mountains making a snow-white background to brick-red mosques and marabouts . Plenty of mosaics , fountains , and doorways to be looked at , and therefore plenty of camouflage for a secret agent . Lanny found a room at the elegant Hotel Mamounia , on the same floor with his family . He met Parsifal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their religion was another form of the Semitic revelation , strictly monotheistic and fundamentally spiritual ; it had fallen victim to various forms of corruption , just as Judaism and Christianity had done , but in its pristine form it was worthy of respect . From this discourse Lanny would go to drink tea  --  real tea , brought in from Tangier  --  and chat with some of Beauty 's ultra-smart friends . There were wealthy refugees from many parts of Europe , and regardless of their political views they were polite to one another . The war would be over some day , and then they would play together again and consider that they were helping to rebuild civilization . This suited Lanny 's role , to be everybody 's friend , provided that it was some person of the " right " sort . They tried not to talk about the war , but of course that was the subject uppermost in everyone 's mind . There were people who liked to pose as being on the " inside , " and who could not resist the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of " the sex , " and so , as Laurel had said in New York , when the wives knew it , the enemy knew it soon . The Hotel Mamounia had become a spy center , just as were the souks , and , in Casablanca , the walled restricted quarter outside the city . It was one world , for the rich had servants , and these knew what the ladies were doing ; they reported it in the underworld , and brought back to their mistresses the gossip of the underworld , and the gossip about other ladies . So Lanny in Marrakech was interested to learn that in Casablanca one of the American secret agents had been fired because he had been discovered to be in secret league with the Germans . Some said that he had had a wireless set and had been reporting the sailing of Allied vessels ; others said that he had been shot , and others that he had been deported to the States . In fact , you could hear almost anything about him , including the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corruption among the Americans pleased the Germans , because it fitted in with what they hot ! been taught about democracy . What interested Lanny especially was to hear fashionable people , includingP322Americans , whispering to one another that the obvious invasion place was Casablanca , and that it was Dakar , and then Tunis , and then the Vardar valley . Beauty Budd , wealthy widow of a famous French painter , had been a social success in Berlin during the twenties ; and now came her urbane and cultured son , who had traveled all over Germany since childhood and knew " everybody . " Among the Germans here were half a dozen of the old kind , who had been good Europeans in the past and who looked forward to the return of those more tolerant and agreeable days . They could n't do anything about it , but they would talk about it in low tones when they were in the right company . Some of them would tell you that they had come to French Morocco because it was a way to get as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience to Lanny was his meeting with Herr Theodor Auer , the German political agent in Morocco . Herr Auer was an important person in his country 's diplomatic world , and also in its industrial world , being the fortunate heir of the great Auer Chemical Works in Cologne . In North Africa he had under his commanda couple of hundred Reichswehr men , many in uniform . It was their business to make sure that the French Army was properly disarmedand stayed that way ; also , of course , they had an elaborate spy system , watching everybody and everything that might threaten Germanpower . Lanny met a young officer of the very stiff and korrekt sort at one of the tea parties in the hotel , an officer who reminded him of General Emil Meissner as he had been in the old days . He mentioned this , and Leutnant Schindler was pleased . He invited Lanny to meet the Chief , and Lanny said he was honored , and was taken upstairs to the great man 's suite . Red-faced and blond-haired , Herr Theodor Auer looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those upper-class Germans who , before the war , and still more in the days of Kaiser Wilhelm II , had aped the British aristocracy and aspired to an alliance with them . Unfortunately King Edward VII had n't liked his German nephew , who was jealous of him , so there had been a French alliance instead . The greatest war in the world 's history up to that time had been partly due to the fact that two chartered libertines with enormouslyinflated egos had been unwilling to yield precedence to each other . P323Here was the son of a great chemical magnate , also with an inflated ego ; and like so many of the Kaiser 's intimates , he was a homosexual . For some reason he was choosing to be cordial to the American art expert , son of a man who was making deadly weapons to be used against Herr Auer 's fellow countrymen . Lanny was invited to have a drink ; and immediately afterward Herr Schindler pleaded that he had an urgent engagement and discreetly disappeared . Lanny wondered if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had . The German began asking questions about where Herr Budd had been in the Fatherland , and whom he had met . So Herr Budd knew Kurt Meissner , the great Koynponist , and his older brother , General Emil Meissner ! A wise and really competent professional soldier , and it was Germany 's tragedy that the advice of such men had not been taken during this war , and even before it , by keeping out of the war . And Herr Budd knew Hilde , Furstin Donnerstein ! She was an old friend of the Auer family . The tragic death of her son at the hands of Russian partisans had broken her heart and she was said to be in poor health now . But what a delightful companion , so full of wit and charm in the old days ! And Graf Stubendorf  --  he had been wounded two or three times ; Auer had not seen him for years , but of old they had been fellow members of the Herrenklub and the Kaiserliche Automobil Klub . Had Lanny visited the Schloss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was a small boy . That was when he had learned to love Germany ; he had gone there one Christmas after another , and two dreadful wars between Germany and France , which had been his home , had cast a black shadow over most of his life . That was the right sort of talk , and presently Herr Auer asked to be allowed to speak in friendly confidence . When Lanny said that he might , he proceeded to explain that he was no Nazi and never had been , but what could a German diplomat and businessman have done when that storm of madness swept over the Fatherland ? Now he was in a devilish position , because he was supposed to direct this Armistice Commission , but he was not a free agent ; the Nazis , distrusting him , had an SS agent watching his every move and the moves of all his subordinates , many of whom felt as he did and not as the Nazis . Herr Budd could be assured that there were many Germans of the better class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path their country had taken and were anxious to save it from the ruin which was now falling upon it out of the skies . P324The son of Budd-Erling had to be extremely careful in meeting such an approach as this , for he had no means of knowing whether the speeches were genuine or just a subtle scheme to trap an enemy agent . Lanny said that as a lover of art he hated all war and did his best to keep aloof from it . This satisfied the talkative German , and he went on to explain that he had become sure the Americans were coming to North Africa , and what he wanted was to unbosom himself to some reputable citizen of that country , who would testify to the fact that he , Herr Auer , was no Nazi , but a friend of law and order in Europe . This friend even hinted that when the Germans here fell captive to the American Army , their head would like to be recognized as a supporterand given his passports so that he could go to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew that Herr Budd 's father , an industrialist like himself and a man of influence , would understand such a situation ; and so on . Lanny explained with the utmost tact that his father had no influence , having been a vehement political opponent of the Administration . As for Lanny himself , he had never had anything to do with politics , because his clients belonged to various nations and schools of thought . " Of course in the event you anticipate , I 'll be glad to do anything in my power . I have cherished all my German friends , and I hope to number you among them , and you may be sure that what you have revealed to me will never be mentioned except as you may request it . " They parted with mutual protestations of esteem . But , as fate willed it , they never laid eyes on each other again . When the Americans took Morocco General Nogues smuggled most of the Armistice Commissioninto Spanish Morocco , and Herr Auer was flown to Berlin . Lanny heard a grim story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treason as well . They found him guilty , and took him out into the courtyard of the building , removed his coat , tied his hands behind him , and made him kneel down and place his head on a large wooden block . A sturdy Henker , dressed in ceremonial black swallow-tailed coat and top hat , took a large broad-bladed double-bit ax , and with one swift stroke chopped off that well-shaped head with the rosy cheeks and the crown of properly barbered blond hair . This spoiled forever Herr Auer 's idea of escaping to the peace and quiet of the Western world ; but it also spared him many worries which the fates were preparing for his countrymen during the next decade and perhaps longer .   LANNY received a letter from Jerry , saying : " I have come upon an especially fine old mosaic , which you ought to see as soon as convenient . " This was code , and Lanny packed his few belongings and had himself transported back to Casablanca . His Moor followed , since the French did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " lady friend , " and was informed that the plot was succeeding well . Items of information had been deliberately planted , and these had been mentioned by the German who was dealing with Faulkner . Jerry said : " They are all hopped up over the mystery of Operation Cornet , and they have offered Faulkner two hundred and fifty thousand francs if he will find out about it . " " Well , " said Lanny , " let him tell them that he has got it and that the price is five hundred thousand . They will appreciate it more . " " That part is all right ; but I do n't see how we can go ahead without having some idea as to the date of the invasion . The thing is apt to go stale ; the Germans will become suspicious , they may find ways to check on the story , and anyhow they 'll no longer feel sure . Can you imagine a pack of U-boats lying off Dakar for a month ? " To this Lanny could only reply : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come this year . " It was then mid-October . " I have been listening to some of the fishermen and others who know this coast , " added his friend . " They say that the swells from the Atlanticmake it impossible to land most of the time . They say it would be only by a fluke that we could have several days of good weather , and that after the middle of November it would be impossible . Nobodybut a bunch of amateurs would try it . " " Well , we have plenty of amateurs in the Army , Jerry , but I think our weather men and our Planning Board know their business . There 's always an element of luck , and we shall have to take our chances . " Jerry had learned through Faulkner and the vice-consul about Mr. Robert Murphy 's recent air journey to Washington and from there to London ; he had returned to Algiers , and all the Americans were agog , believing that this meant action  --  and oh , how tired they were of waiting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign against Rommel 's forces , an indication that there also an attack was impending . Lanny came to a decision : " I have several matters to attend to in Algiers , and I will put the situation before Murphy and see what he advises . I will write you a letter from there , saying that you may expect me back in Casablanca to look at a mosaic on such and such a date . That will be the date which Faulkner is to give the Germans as the date when the convoys will be leaving the United States . If I say that I have already seen the mosaic in question , it will mean that the sailings have begun . " " I 'll remember , " promised the ex-tutor . He repeated the words , to make sure . In Algiers it was still summer , hot and sultry ; the rainy season was soon due , but it was hard to see how the air could carry any more moisture . The white office buildings and apartment houses on the hill slopes gleamed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air or the sea , but not so pleasant when the hot pavements and walls were giving you a perpetual Turkish bath . Lanny shut himself up in a hotel room and typed out a report about conditions in Morocco . He addressed an envelope : " To the President . Personal from Traveler , " and put the report in the envelope , but did not seal it . Instead he went outside to a telephone and called the AmericanCounselor . When he heard the friendly Irish-American voice he said : " This is the party whom you met at lunch with LemaigreDubreuil . I have something of first-rate importance to tell you , but there are reasons why I should not come to your office . Would you be willing to come to my room in the St. George Hotel . " " Why certainly , Mr.  --  " the Counselor stopped just in time . " I 'll be sitting in the lobby waiting , and if you will follow me into the elevator , the visit will not attract any attention . I will explain this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , and Lanny went back and waited . When the pair were safely shut up in his room , LannyP327took the envelope from his pocket and put it into the other 's hands . The Counselor glanced at it , then stared at the giver . " Where did you get this ? " " I wrote it , " Lanny said . " Well , I 'll be damned ! " exclaimed the other . " So you are Traveler ' ? " " Did n't you have any idea of it ? " inquired Lanny with a grin . " To be frank , I did ; but I could never feel sure . Why are you tellingme now ? " " The President left me free to tell you some time ago , but I make it a rule never to tell anything unless it is necessary . Even my parents and my wife have not been told . " Lanny took from his pocket the visiting card which he had unsewed for the occasion . Murphy took it and read : " My friend Lanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed the card back , remarking : " Of course that settles it . What can I do for you ? " " First , transmit this report to the President . I have left it open so that you may read it . " " There is no need to do that . " " There are items in it which may be of use to you , and anyhow , I wish you to know what I am saying . I have to explain that the President sent me here to do one particular job . Did he say anything to you about it ? " " He did n't mention you . " " I 'm not sure whether you saw him after I did , or before . Anyhow , here is the story . " Lanny told about Jerry Pendleton and Dr. Faulkner and the stolen codebooks and other devices . Murphy listened attentively , and when he had heard it all he said : " Very ingenious , and of course if we can succeed it will be tremendouslyimportant . I heard about this Faulkner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the trouble to report the truth to me . " " I doubt if anybody in Algiers knows the facts , and it is n't a matter to be entrusted to a letter . I hope you wo n't feel that I have been buttingin on your vice-consuls . At the President 's suggestion , I talked it over with the O.S.S. outfit in Washington , and they gave their approval- " The Counselor held out his hand and shook Lanny 's . " Here is a bargain , " he said . " You need never worry about protocol . What I want is to lick the Nazis , and everybody who can help is my friend . Keep me informed as much as you can , so that we wo n't be treading on each other 's toes . " P328It was by dealing with men on this heartwarming basis that Robert Daniel Murphy had risen from a humble post-office clerk to a position of responsibility for his country 's affairs in a territory of nearly two million square miles and containing some seventeen million inhabitants . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his job . Lanny was prepared to be fond of him , and he in turn did his best to make this possible . They agreed that for reasons of secrecy they had better not adopt the American custom of addressing each other by their first names . Each would trust the other with the information necessary to success , and if either had any fault to find with what the other was . doing , he would have it out face to face and not behind the other 's back . This career diplomat had come up the hard way ; he had been born in Milwaukee , and his father had been a railroad sectionhand ; he was , as he told Lanny , " sod " Irish , not " lace-curtain . " He had worked his way through college and law school , an experience which fills some youths with rebellious egalitarian feelings , and others with respect for the privileged classes and a desire to join them . Lanny had already made up his mind that the genial Bob Murphy belonged in the latter group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career in the most snobbish branch of the United States government on any other basis . Lanny had had opportunity to watch this phenomenon from boyhood . Whenever he had met an American diplomat or consular official he had found a gentleman who called himself " conservative , " and believedwholeheartedly in the " free enterprise " system , as it had come to be called ; to Lanny it was the " capitalist " system , but that was a term rarely heard among respectable people . Under that system Americahad become the richest and most prosperous country in the world , and when a diplomat talked about making the world safe for democracy , he meant safe for that system , and was certain that it was the destiny of his country , under God , to establish and maintain it throughoutthe world . That was why Robert Murphy could get so much help from Lemaigre-Dubreuil and others of that sort ; Lemaigre was capable , he was accustomed to command , and he was quite sure that men like himself would be restored to their property and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day he would find himself in opposition to Robert Murphy 's policies in North Africa and elsewhere ; but that timeP329was not now . First , the Nazis had to be licked , and for that purpose this genial yet determined Counselor was a tower of strength . What the diplomat 's heart was set upon was keeping the French Army and Navy from fighting the Americans , and for this purpose he needed the support of the " best " people , the people who had influence in a colonialcommunity , those who could entertain Army and Navy officers and persuade them that the Nazi-Fascists were not the only people who knew how to hold down the Reds , that the Americans had a method at once more polite and more permanent . Look at Mr. Murphy and his twelve vice-consuls , such fine gentlemanly fellows , all of them admirers of French culture , and surely not one of them offering any threat to the established social order ! The railroad sectionhand 's son talked frankly about these matters with the son of Budd-Erling Aircraft . It never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any views different from his own ; and of course Lanny gave him no reason for questioning . Laney was a lover of the beaux arts , who had been picked up by the President of the United States and put to work for his country , just as thousands of others , indeed millions , had been picked up and given jobs in this desperate emergency . Lanny was " right " in every way ; he knew the " right " people , and could be trusted to say the " right " word and do the " right " thing , whether it was winning a war or merely holding a knife and fork . The problem they had to settle at present was what Faulkner was to tell the Germans . Murphy said : " The date of D-day is the most precioussecret in the world . We are n't telling it even to the Frenchmen who are helping us . Surely we ca n't give it to the Germans ! " Lanny countered : " On the other hand , the President has given me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I have to tell them some date to be there . We ca n't just say , go and stay until somethingconies along . " They discussed this dilemma from various angles . Lanny admitted that he should have thought to put this question to the President ; he wondered now if he would have to fly back to Washington and have instructions sent to the Counselor in code . He was afraid to let Murphycable the details and ask for instructions . Roosevelt had mentioned to Lanny that the expeditions to Mediterraneanports were sailing from Scotland , while those to the Atlantic ports were sailing from America . " I suppose that means New York ,   Boston , Baltimore , " Lanny said , and Murphy replied that it might also mean Savannah and New Orleans , the railroads were heavily taxed . Lanny added : " I suppose they will have different sailing dates and meet at sea . Does it seem possible that all those convoys can sail withoutthe German agents getting some message through by way of Spain or Sweden or Switzerland ? " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued : " Then suppose we give the Germans an approximate sailing date . I do n't mean necessarily the correct one , but one which would put the convoy close to Dakar at the time we want the subs to be there . " But , really , it would be the date ! Distances from American ports to Dakar and to Casablanca were not so different  --  about four thousandmiles  --  and the speed of convoys could be estimated ; it was always , of necessity , the speed of the slowest vessel . Lanny was prepared to have Murphy give a flat no to his suggestion . After all , it would be possible for a crook to have a visiting card engraved with the name " Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt , " and to imitate that important person'shandwriting . But Lanny was a " gentleman , " and the genial Bob assumed that he was behaving as one ; the Counselor assumed the same thing about Jacques Lemaigre-Dubreuil , and about that gentleman 's Man Friday , who had been notorious in Paris as a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men who had records as partisans of the cartels , the Two Hundred Families , the royalist pretender  --  andall looking to Mr. Murphy for their future . Lanny wanted to say : " Watch your step , Bob ! " Lanny sent the code letter to Jerry , giving him the date . Then he dropped a note to young Denis de Bruyne , and they had one of their quiet meetings and long talks . Lanny told about his visit to the States and about his father and his mother , both of them known to the Frenchman from boyhood . Lanny could n't say anything about the scheme he had cooked up , but he could say that the Yanks were coming , and before the end of the year . Denis said : " I hear a lot of talk about Dakar , Lanny , and that worries me ; it is too far away to do us any good . " Lanny could only answer : " It might be that we would feel it necessary to keep the Germans from getting that port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had news . He and his group had been diligently working and had made a great deal of headway . Many officers , as well as many influential civilians , were coming to the opinion that thingsp331would be better if the Americans came ; this was true even from the business point of view , for , while the Germans took all the products of French North Africa and paid high prices for them , what could you buy with the money ? The Germans sent no goods , and very little could be sent from France because the Germans bought the French goods , too . People were beginning to say that if the Americans came , trade would be open , and the soldiers would spend money  --  no French man or woman would ever forget those wonderful free-spenders of World War I.The really important news was about the French officers . The continuedkilling of hostages by the Nazis in France was troubling their consciences , while the stand the Russians were making at Stalingrad was impressing their professional minds . A deadly battle had been waged on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not keep the truth about it from spreading . If now the British could actually drive Rommel out of Egypt , and if the Americans would actuallycome and not talk just about it , Frenchmen might be able to hope again . General Juin , commander of what was left of the French Army in North Africa , and General Mast , who commanded under Juin in the region of Algiers , were both now committed to welcoming the promised invasion . Denis was exultant about this , because he had been working on these top men . " You understand , Lanny , " he explainedmodestly , " in military terms I am a mere capitaine , but because of my father 's position I enjoy a sort of civilian rank . " The art expert was again invited to the home of Professor Aboulker , and here he found the same atmosphere of eagerness mixed with anxiety . There was a half-open conspiracy to turn Algiers over to the gay legions of the New World ; but it was a tremulous conspiracy , for if the Vichy elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the past they had recalled Weygand ; they might send some of their terrorists over to take charge and jail all the disaffected ones and submit them to torture . " Sister Anne , Sister Anne , do you see anybody coming ? " had been the cry of Bluebeard 's wife in the fairytale , and that was the mood of the anti-Nazis in Algiers . What were the Americans waiting for , and why would nobody set a date so that people here could make plans ? And what was this talk about Dakar , and how did they expect to get to any place from a peanut port down near the equator ? All that M. Budd could say was : " You will have to believe , gentlemen , that the Joint Chiefs of Staff know what they are doing , and that it takes time to turn peacetime industry to war production . " P332Lanny received a note from Jerry , saying that he looked forward with pleasure to showing his friend the wonderful mosaic on the twenty-first inst . That meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny had nothing to do but wait . He was by this time so tired of mosaics that he wished never to see another ; but he had to go and view some in Algiers , and to start Hajek at some nego-tiations , JJeven though he had no more purchasers in sight . He devoted a couple of days to this , and then came a note from Denis requesting to see him . The arrangement there was that Lanny would be at a retiredspot in the showy gardens of the hotel , and Denis would stroll through , first having made sure that he was not being followed . In such a spy center as this it was likely to happen at any time , and Lanny had thought once or twice that it was happening to him . Denis had a lot to report about the success of the underground work that he and his friends were doing . He said that everyone he talked to kept repeating one word : " When ? When ? When ? " Saying it in French , " Quand ? Quand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the " qu " pronounced as " k , " it sounded exactly like the cawing of crows ; but Lanny had no food for these hungry crows and could only say : " I wish I knew . " The capitaine had one truly exciting bit of information . Said he : " Here is something you must keep absolutely to yourself . Some of your top Army officers are coming secretly to meet Juin and Mast in the next day or two , to work out plans for letting the Army in without resistance . " " That is indeed news , " replied the P.A. " How did you come to hear it ? " " In a very simple way . It is D'Astier de la Vigerie who was asked to arrange a meeting place . He recalled a house on the coast , beyond the town of Cherchell , a lonely spot . One of our friends , an ardent Gaullist and former mayor of Algiers , owns the house ; it is off the highway , on a bluff almost over the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will show you that our officers really mean to cooperate . You see , they are afraid that the Germans may come first , and that Franco may help them . Also , I think it means that your Army must be coming soon , or they would n't take such a risk . It would certainlymean shooting for our Army friends if the Laval gang should get wind of the meeting here . "   " Do you know who the American officers are , Denis ? " " We have not been told that . We only know that they are coming in a submarine , which will surface after dark and put them ashore . The water is deep in front of the house I speak of , and I suppose the sub will bring little boats . " " That is surely an important story if it is true , " said Lanny . His old friend assured him that there could be no doubt about it , the French generals had this appointment and were going to this rendezvous . Whether the Americans would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fly to Gibraltar and board the submarine there . Lanny prepared another report for F.D.R. , this time on conditions he had observed in Algiers . He left it unsealed , as before , and called the Counselor 's office . He had another nom de guerre now , " Mr. Merriweather " ; Murphy , who liked to make jokes as much as the President of the United States , had assigned this name on a particularly hot and muggy day . He would instruct his secretary that when Mr. Merriweathertelephoned , the call was to be put through to him at once . Lanny would say : " I have some cigars , " and Murphy would come to the hotel . Since his car was so well known in the city he would park some distance away , take a stroll , enter the hotel l ) y an inconspicuous door , and come up the stairs , not using the elevator ; he would come directly to Lanny 's room and enter unannounced , and he would leave in the same quiet way . The relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rivals for the favor of a prince , and that through all history has been a cause of poisonings and the play of rapiers and daggers . Lanny did n't want any such play , and had been relieved to discover that the genial Bob was not of a jealous and suspicious nature . Lanny had the advantage in the relationship , in that he dealt directly with the President , whereas Murphy dealt through the State Department , which meant the aged and tired Mr. Hull ; Lanny could go to see the Presidentat any time , whereas Murphy had gone only when he was summoned . Lanny had descended upon the Counselor , literally out of the clouds , and he might fly away again to his home on Mount Olympus , and who could say what thunderbolts he might cause to be hurled down upon a helpless mortal known as a career diplomat ? There was a still more embarrassing element in the relationship , the deadly thing known as snobbery . Lanny was to the manner born , while Bob was the son of a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was awed by the elegance and serenity which inherited wealth confers ? Lanny had observed this phenomenon in the case of Charlie Alston , who had been a " barb " at Yale , earning his living by waiting table , while Robbie Budd had been a splendid aristocrat , a shining football hero . All his life that attitude had lingered , deep in Alston 's soul ; he had told Lanny about it in a laughing way . When the time had come that his official duty had required him to browbeat Robbie , he had done it , but it had taken greater moral effort than if he had been born to wealth and had learned to browbeat people from infancy . So , naturally , Lanny wondered whether that same situation might exist here . Did Robert Murphy consider the son of Budd-Erling a socially superior person ? Lanny was embarrassed to have such an advantageover any man ; but he could n't say it to this one , because it might sound like Pink doctrine , or even outright Red . All he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time wonder whether this might wear the appearance of condescension . He would have liked to say " Call me Lanny , " but they had agreed that that would be dangerous . So they would just go on doing their job , and Budd would convince Murphy that he , too , had only one thought in the world , to knock out the hateful Nazis . Lanny handed his report to Murphy , who read it and said he had no changes to suggest . Looking at him with a slight quizzical expression , the P.A. remarked : " I do n't suppose you want me to put in anything about the Cherchell meeting . " Utter consternation on the other man 's face . " What the dickens ! " he exclaimed . " Do n't blame me , " smiled Lanny . " It is my business to find out things . " " Would you mind telling me what you know ? " " Surely not . I am told that several top American officers are coming in a sub from Gibraltar , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet them in a house on the coast a few miles beyond Cherchell . " " Well , Budd , you have me down . Understand , I do n't object to your knowing , but who told you ? I am terrified at the thought that others may be talking about this ultra-secret matter . "   " Do n't worry , my friend . The person who told me will not tell anyone else . " The amiable Irishman got over his panic , and the blood came back to his usually rosy cheeks . He studied the son of Budd-Erling through a pair of bright blue eyes , and suddenly he opened up : " See here , Budd ; since you know about this , how would you like to come along ? " It was Lanny 's turn to be taken aback . " I had n't thought of the possibility . How could I take the risk of meeting a bunch of French officers ? I have carefully caused . them to think of me as an itinerant art expert . " " You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't propose to introduce you . " " What use would I be , then ? " " Let me explain . You may have difficulty in believing this  --  " " I am going to believe anything you tell me , Murphy , " Lanny put in quickly . The other flushed with pleasure . " Thank you . I thought several times of the idea of inviting you . The only person who will ride with me is Knight , one of our vice-consuls , a man of integrity and discretion . If I told him that you were my friend , and that your name was not to be mentioned , now or later , he would obey orders , I am certain . " " That I do n't doubt . But what good could I do ? " " You must understand that we are going into a really dangerous adventure . I do n't want to sound stagy , but we are in the enemy 's country ; the Vichy crowd command here , and they would like nothing better than to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would do to Americans and British whom they would call spies I can not be sure , but it would make a terrific international scandal . " " I had not been told that any British were coming . " " The party will come in a British submarine , because there is no other available . As a concession to French feelings , an American will command it , but it will be British commando officers who will put the party ashore , and they will have to stay in the house while the conferencegoes on . It might happen that they will stay for some time , if a storm should come up and they could not launch the boats . You can see that all this presents a lot of worries to a civilian official who has never played a part in a melodrama and thought that all spy stories were made in Hollywood . " " I can understand that , Murphy . And if I could help without jeopardizingmy own position  --  "  | " This is what has crossed my mind . Both Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer questions ; and we ought to be free to have our minds on that . If in the meantime I were sure that there was someone keeping watch outside who would know how to handle any situation which might arise , it would be a great load off my mind . Understand , I do n't mean that you should serve as an armed guard or anything of that sort ; if it comes to a fight the commando men and the American officers will not need any help . The head of the expedition will be General Mark Clark , who is General Eisenhower 's next in command , and is to head all our invasion forces in North Africa . You will not need be told of my intense anxiety to protect such a man . " " Indeed yes , Murphy . I am surprised that he should be taking this chance , or series of chances . Tell me exactly what you imagine I could do . " " You know French , Budd , and you know the French people . You understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess that happy gift called savoir-faire . I ca n't imagine that you would lose your head in any emergency . I would tell both the Americans and the French that I had brought a personal friend , who was going to keep watch , and you could stay out in the darkness , unidentified . If any personsapproached the house you would know how to greet them and answer their questions and allay any suspicions they might have . I hope and pray that nothing of the sort will happen , but there are many things that might happen , and I would be grateful to be relieved of anxiety so that I could put my mind on the problems of the confer-ence . " " What story would I tell anyone who came ? " " We should have to talk that out . There are many details I would need to tell you , but there is no use bothering your mind unless you mean to come . What do you say ? " " What I say , Murphy , is that this is n't the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is an emergency , and if you feel that you need me , I wo n't say no . I put it up to you , however : you have to take the responsibility of asking me to come . " " I ask you , " said the Counselor decisively . " All right , then , " said the P.A. " I will come . " The meeting was set for the day after next , or rather for one o'clock in the morning of the day after that . Meantime Lanny attended a ses-P337sion with Murphy and the vice-consul named Knight , an American who had been a wine salesman in France for so long that his English had a French accent . These two had already visited the house , and they described it as extensive , of Moorish construction , two-storied , and white , like most houses here . It stood out conspicuously , the only building for several miles of the coast ; at the hour appointed there would be a light burning in a second-story window facing the sea , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were woods on the property , which might serve as a place of escape in case of emergency . There were two Moorish fa  --  ies who farmed the land , and the owner had arranged to pay these and let them take a holiday during the time of the conference . The three conspirators set their wits to work to imagine all the things which might go wrong , and it was astonishing how capable their imaginations proved . The submarine might be sighted by somebody , or the trail of the boats when dragged ashore might be noticed . The plan might have been betrayed by one of the French officers , or by a wife or a mistress . Spies might follow them , or observe them as they entered from the highway . Someone on the highway might have a flat tire , or get into a wreck and come to the house to use the telephone . The Moorish families might have had their curiosity excited , or they might take some whim to come home  --  they were an undependablepeople . And so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate , would have to say in each of these situations had to be thought out and discussed . The most serious possibility was that something might bring the French police . Murphy said it was a safe guess that American staff men and British commando men would not let themselves he taken without a fight ; if there were any prisoners , it would he the French , and there would be a jolly time getting them out to the sub in the sort of tiny boats that a sub could carry . And always hanging over everything was the possibility of a storm , or even an ordinary wind from the north , that might keep the invaders helpless on the shore for a week ; also the fact that the place was only about seventy-five miles from Algiers , not much more than an hour 's drive in a fast car . Yes , there were plenty of troubles to be imagined ! The host was to provide food and wine , to be paid for by the consulate ; undoubtedly the French would bring wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pocket flasks at least . If all that were set up on a table it would make quite a show of liquor , and possiblyit would n't be long before some of the bottles were empty . P338Murphy said : " If the police should come , I think our best story would be that I am giving a wild party for some of my friends , and it would be very rude of the police to interrupt . Unfortunately I 'm not sure that I know just how to give a wild party . Do you , Mr. Budd ? " Lanny answered : " I once got two Nazi officers drunk and got some information out of them ; so I could play a part in such a scene . But I have n't the right to , for reasons that you know . " The Counselor agreed that Lanny was not to come into the house under any circumstances . Lanny 's job was to stay outside and use his savoir-faire , his bonhomie , his insouciance , his bel esprit  --  all the social qualities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dissuade anybody from approaching the house . If the person insisted , Lanny was to let him come , and the Counselor would be the one to deal with him . There was a courtyard and a gate , and Lanny 's post would be just outside ; in the daytime he could sleep in the servants ' quarters , or hide himself in the woods and read a book ; Knight would see that he got food and whatever liquid he voted for . Lanny said : " I suppose it would n't do any harm if during the day I strolled out toward the highway , and if I saw a car turning in , I might stop it and put my arts to work out there . " This permission being given , a man who was expecting his forty-third birthday in less than a month , and who had been playing the role of Prince Charming since the age of three or four , spent a good part of the next two days imaginingall the different kinds of people who might turn off a route nationalsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade them to turn back . Before he got through he decided that he had invented a new kind of parlor game . On the appointed evening , which happened to be the twenty-first of October  --  the day when the Germans had been told that the convoys i would be sailing  --  the consulate car was loaded , and Lanny Budd was picked up while strolling on the street at twilight . A beautiful drive , because French roads are always good , and mountains looming into a starlit sky make a landscape that affects the subconscious mind with a sense of awe , even while the conscious mind is occupied with treason and stratagems . As the car sped into its own bright beam the three men rehearsed their little dramas . They knew they were heading into adventure , and might be making history . The house was not far from the highway , but was hidden by pineP339trees . The elderly French owner welcomed them ; all his servants had been sent away , so they carried their belongings themselves . The owner showed them around again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . There was a good path down to the beach , impossible to miss . The place seemed made to order for smugglers , and in past times it had been used for that purpose . Lanny , introduced under the name of Merriweather , was shown a place where he could sleep , and Murphysuggested that he should sleep now if he could . His vigil would not begin until the submarine gave a signal ; after that it might be long . Lanny slept , and the fleas were not too bad  --  he could tell himself that it was wartime and the G.I. 's would have far worse to endure . He did not waken till dawn , and then sat up with a start , wondering if he had been failing in his duty . But no , the others told him that they had lighted the window on time and had kept alternating vigils , but there had come no signal from the sea and no boats . What had happened was beyond guessing , but now , obviously , it was too late , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might sleep some more , or have his breakfast and take a walk . The French officers were expected by motorcar at seven in the morning . After they had arrived , he might keep watch out near the road if he did n't mind  --  thus the polite and considerate Bob Murphy . Lanny did n't mind at all . He had picked up in a bookstall a wellthumbedand marked-up copy of Palgrave 's Golden Treasury , which some tourist had left behind . In boyhood Lanny had learned a good deal of it by heart , and now to reread it was to relive the happiest of his days . In between Sir Philip Sidney and Thomas Campion he would take glances at the highway , on which very few cars passed , only patientlyplodding donkeys , overloaded and cruelly mistreated , in Mediterraneanfashion . None of this traffic showed any wish to turn toward the lonely house on the bluff , and none paid any attention to an Americangentleman sitting in the shade of an acacia tree , reading a small book bound in dark blue cloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that it had arrived at four o'clock in the morning , and those on board ' ' had seen the light ; but it was judged too late to get ashore and hide the boats , and anyhow , there had been a misunderstanding as to the date . Now the sub was out there under the water , and for a while it poked its periscope up so that one of the commandos could make sketches ofP340the shoreline , something that would be useful to them later . Then it went down again , and all on board were in a miserable situation , for there were eight extra men on board and that was an overload ; the air became so foul that a struck match would not burn . Everybody had a headache , but they stuck it out until dark , and then the little vessel surfaced and came as close to the shore as it dared . They had four tiny collapsible boats on board , called kayaks , after the craft of the Eskimos . They were made of board and waterproof canvas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for two men , facing each other and curling up their legs . It was a beautiful clear night , but a high sea was running , and it was a job to get those little walnut shells off . One capsized and had to be pulled on board and started again , badly cracked ; but all four made the beach , and five Americans and three Britishers stepped ashore . The first was Colonel Julius Holmes , who was General Eisenhower 's Political Adviser on French Affairs ; stumbling up the path in the darkness , he was pleased to hear the voice of Vice-Consul Knight , and to learn that they had found the right place . Lanny stood on the bluff at one side of the path , out of sight in the darkness , and learned that all was well . Then he went back to his post at the gate and stayed there all through the night , which seemed abnormallylong . Sometimes he paced up and down , sentry fashion , and sometimes he sat propped against a tree , reciting to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day . The soul of Britain seemed near and dear to him in these days when the Mother of the Free was being tried as never before in her long history . Her fate was bound up with that of all her children , including her wayward and overgrown child across the Atlantic . Now and then the watcher dozed . There was no harm in that , because he was sure that no one could approach the gate without his awakening , and his job was not military but diplomatic . Neither friend nor foe appeared , and when daylight came , Knight , who brought him breakfast , reported that the French and the Americans were still in unbrokenconference ; the three Britons were asleep in an upstairs room , making themselves inconspicuous to the resentful French . The viceconsuladded with a chuckle that their pants were still wet and wet pants were uncomfortable . Lanny 's imagination was busy with what was going on inside that house . He could guess that the French generals had not summoned theP341Americans unless they meant business , and he could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later on , when Murphy told him what had happened , he knew that they had really been making history . The new allies had given data beyond the dreams of any superspy : a complete set of military maps of all French North Africa , showing the ground , the elevations , the beaches , the airfields ; charts of the waters , with soundings , and facts concerning military installations , fortifications , storerooms , and supplies ; figures as to the airports , the length of the runways and materials of construction ; figures concerningtransportation , the number of engines and cars . Most important of all were complete plans for an invading army , including the various forms of co-operation the French might be able to give  --  the blocking of fortifications from the rear , the seizure of radio stations and airports , newspapers , public buildings , and records , and the protection of water power and transmission lines in Morocco . All that was surely worth collecting , and a solitary watcher sitting out by the highway could be sure that his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and whenever a car came along , which was rarely , he watched it , prepared to step out if it should turn in toward the house . Shortly after Lanny finished the box lunch that was brought to him , there came a peasant cart , hauled by one forlorn donkey , which turned into the road . Lanny hailed the man , and discoveredthat he knew only a few words of French . But one of these was poulets , and he drew back a cover and revealed sixteen dressed chickens , undoubtedly intended for the visitors ' dinner . Lanny would get his share and be pleased ; but orders were orders , so he walked beside the cart to the gate and called the master , the proper one to handle this situation . The P.A. returned to his post . In the middle of the afternoon came another interruption of Wordsworth and Shelley . This time it was a large cart drawn by two mules and containing an assortment of Moors of both sexes and all sizes . One middle-aged man spoke a voluble if confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a stranger . These were the farmers who lived here and had been sent away for a holiday ; they had come back early because they were worried about the care of their stock . This was an emergency which had been foreseen by the Americans , and Lanny faithfully tried all the diplomacy , all the arguments , everything that had been planned , and more . But the Moors were as stubborn as the mules they drove ; this was their home , they did n't want any more holidays , they did n't want any more money , they wanted to come home and make sure their livestock was not suffering neglect . Lanny followed them up to the gate and called the owner . There was a delay in finding him , and meantime two of the younger fellows leaped off the cart and started toward the tenant houses . Lanny called to them , but they started to run and he had no way to stop them . Presumably their curiosity had been aroused , for one of them went to the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the submarine was not in sight . Later on he learned that there had been something else in sight . The British officers , who had hidden the boats in the brush , had brought up the damaged boat and repaired it , and then had decided that it would be wise to bring the others up into the ample kitchen and dry them and make sure there were no cracks . The owner came out , and he had authority ; also , he could speak Moorish . He gave each of the farmers money , and the cart was turned about ; the two youths were called , and the whole outfit drove away again , but not without grumbling . What the master had told them Lanny did n't know , but he could guess that the town of Cherchell did n't offer much in the way of recreation , and that an undesired holidaypaid for with unaccustomed sums of money must have seemed a strange phenomenon to primitive-minded peasants , whose cows and ducks and chickens were the most important things in the world to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look good . Murphy replied that the Americans would go as soon as it was dark . Lanny added : " If they can . " Heavy swells were rolling in from the sea and pounding on the beach ; the chances of launching those tiny kayaks in such a surf appeared extremely slim to a man who had lived a good part of his life on Mediterranean shores and had played in boats of all sizes . Back to his post of duty . Lanny was worried now , and did not think about poetry . The Counselor had said exultantly : " We have got treasuresbeyond price ! " And Lanny did n't have to be told how important it was to get those treasures on board the submarine . He watched the highway to the east , from which trouble was to be feared . Meantime the sun sank lower behind the hills to the west . Being no more than human , he thought occasionally of roast chicken , and wondered who was going to cook it . The three Englishmen , who had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to him , or would he have to wait until darkness had fallen and he returned to the gate ? The alarm , when it came , was not from the highway , but from the house . There was a telephone line to it , and Lanny could guess that somebody had called and given warning . He heard loud voices from the courtyard , and a minute or so later the gates were thrown open and two cars came roaring out without lights . It took them but a few secondsto reach the highway ; there they had to slow up to make the turn , and in one quick glimpse Lanny saw that the occupants were French officers , one of them , a gray-mustached and pudgy person in his underwear . Lanny was later told that in the excitement the old gentleman had taken off his uniform and rolled it into a bundle , thinkingthus to escape recognition . But he was riding in a car with other officers who had their uniforms on ! The cars turned to the west , which told Lanny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody , whether police or military , was coming from the capital , and the officers were getting away . Where the officers would go was their problem ; where Lanny went was to the house , as fast as he could run , and through the open gate . The courtyard was empty , the front door open , and lights burned brightly . He had been forbidden to enter , but he knew that the French were gone , and he was willing in an emergency to be known to the Americansand the British . So he went to the doorway and looked in . There were Murphy , Knight , and two young French lieutenants in uniform ; in one glance Lanny took in a large living-room , with several tables put together in the center . No doubt they had been covered with maps and papers , but these had been swept up and put away , and now there were bottles of all kinds and sizes , empty or full . " Murphy ! " Lanny called , and the Counselor came quickly . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar whiteness which so many Celts show . " Come outside , " Murphy whispered , and they moved out of the light . " A terrible thing ! A telephone call to the owner , the police will be here any minute . " " Where are the Americans and the British ? " asked the P.A. " We have put them down in the wine cellar , and we must keep the police from lifting the trapdoor . The boats are in the kitchen and that is locked ; we must keep them out of there also . Remember , it 's a wild party , and it has to seem real . " " I 'll do my best , " Lanny promised , and Murphy went back into the house and closed the door . Lanny went to the gate , drew it shut , andP344took his stand in front of it , not without palpitations of the heart . He had faced many dangers and difficulties in his career , but at the momentthis seemed to top them all . Mentally he rehearsed his lessons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need a lot of it this time ! Car lights appeared on the highway to the east , speeding rapidly . When they came to the entrance road , they slowed up and turned , and the two lights made a wide quarter-circle and came to rest , both of them precisely on Lanny Budd 's face , or so it seemed to him . They became larger and larger , brighter and brighter , and he faced them as if they were the eyes of all the world , or at any rate of all Nazidom and all Vichy collaboratisme . He stood his ground , and the car stopped within a few feet of him . From it descended a cozmnissaire de police and a couple of his men . The driver remained in the car . They would be armed , Lanny knew ; but he was pleased to notice that what they had in their hands were flashlight torches . With the politeness acquired in the best social circles Lanny said : " Bonsoir , Messieurs . " The official replied with the same politeness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What is it that it is that is going on here ? " So began the long duel of wits which had been so carefully prepared . Lanny explained first that he was a friend of Counselor Robert Murphy , and that this American official had leased this house for the purpose of giving a party to his friends . " It happens unfortunately , Monsieur , that my countrymen do not always content themselves with the good wines of this district ; they have to have distilled liquors , and they get into a state of frenzy . It happens that I prefer good wines , and I do n't like to stupefy myself , so I came out to get a little fresh air and look at the stars which should make all drunkards ashamed of themselves . " This with Lanny Budd 's best drawing-room grace , and a commissairede police could have no doubt that he was in the presence of a gentleman of elegance and wealth , even if his linen suit had been rumpled by sitting out under trees . " So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , and Lanny replied that that was precisely what it was . " It causes me regret to say , " announced the official , " that it hasbeen reported to us there has been black-marketing going on here . " Black-marketing , Monsieur ? But it must be that some enemy is tell-P345ing you the tale . The American Counselor and staff are surely not black-marketeers . " " It is reported that men have been seen carrying heavy bundles up the path from the sea . " " Oh , ca ! " exclaimed the gentleman , hardly able to keep from burstingwith laughter . " That is a tale which you will enjoy telling to your grandchildren . There were three of the guests at the party whose drinking was not to be controlled , and for fear that they would kill themselves we carried them down to the sea and doused them in the water . It had an excellent effect and they are now peacefully sleeping . I am sure that if you had seen us struggling to get them up the path , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some reason the officer was not eager to share this merriment . " Is this party still continuing ? " he demanded . " It is our very bad rule that parties go on so long as anybody wants to drink . Most of the guests now are sleeping , and I trust that you will not have to disturb them . But , of course , if you wish to join the party , we should be most happy . " " I am on duty , Monsieur . " " We have good wine , as well as English whisky , and it is no violationof duty to enjoy one glass . I am sure that if you care to come , the Counselor will welcome you . I am happy to tell you that the etiquette of American parties requires the host to remain in possession of his senses . " It would have been bad tactics to try to keep the men from entering , and much better to invite them than to wait for them to make a demand . Lanny pushed back the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps they noticed that there was only one car ; if they had commented on it , Lanny was prepared to explain that the guests had come to stay for some time . This was a wild party to end all wild parties . Lanny led them to the front door and opened it , and there was a sight to shock the eyes of any guardian of public morality : a long table with plates and remnants of food , and not fewer than thirty bottles of every description , some of them empty and some full , some upset and dripping . Many glasses , some broken , and a dozen or more ash trays , full of ashes and cigar and cigarette stubs . At the table sat Vice-Consul knight and the two French lieutenants in uniform . These latter were risking their lives to play this part ; they had taken the de-P346cision on the spur of the moment , and were now doing it very well ; their eyes were half shut and their heads were drooping and they were singing " Madelon " in droning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counselor , tall , slightly stoopshouldered , a man close to fifty and with thinning hair  --  surely he ought to have known better than to conduct such an affair as this . Lanny , who had made up on the spur of the moment the story about the dousing of the drunks , wanted his friend to be prepared , so he entered the room laughing gaily and explaining : " These gentlemen have come to investigate the place . It has been reported to them that we have been engaged in black-marketing . The men we doused in the sea and carried up to the house were taken for heavy bundles . You can certify how heavy they were ! " The three drunks at the table broke into maudlin laughter , and Murphy , suave and dignified , smiled pleasantly and assured the commissairethat neither he nor his government were engaged in cheating the government of France . The inquisition began all over again , and the commissaire revealed that he considered it his duty to search the house . At this the diplomatic official became very dignified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourtesy . He was greatly embarrassed because his guests had drunk too much , but now he had got them to bed , and he would certainly resent having them disturbed . During the time of this ceremonious discussion the eight raiders were crowded into an ancient winecellar , dry in two senses of the word . Everything was covered with dust , and they had disturbed it . The dust got into the throat of a British captain , and he had to struggle with the impulse to cough . In his desperation he all but choked himself , and he gasped a request to General Clark for a piece of chewing gum . Clark gave him a piece , and he chewed it and managed to suppress the cough . Later Clark whispered to him , asking if the gum had helped , and the Briton replied that it had n't much flavor . Clark said : " I had been chewing it for an hour . " This was considered to be hilariously funny , but not until later . They could hear the voices overhead , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered to crouch close against the walls , with the idea that if the trapdoor were lifted they might escape notice . Clark had whispered the order : " If we have to fight , shoot to kill . " But they all knew that that would he a calamity and might entirelyP347defeat the purpose of their visit . They could only sit still , and pray if they knew how . Up in the main room the controversy had reached a point where Lanny judged it advisable to point out to the commissaire that Americanwild parties sometimes involved the presence of ladies , and it would be extremely embarrassing to these to have their privacy disturbed by a police search . The Counselor inquired : " What would you think if you were to read in the newspapers that Frenchmen in America , giving a private party , had had their home invaded and searched ? " " But this is not your home , Monsieur , " objected the official . " When I have leased it , it becomes legally my home , " was the reply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not realize that I enjoy diplomatic immunity , and that you are standingupon the soil of the United States of America . " " But this is wartime , Monsieur ! " " It is not wartime between my government and yours . My government is doing everything in its power to preserve peace and friendship with your government , and it is you who have committed a hostile act . " That rather stumped the police official ; at any rate , he did n't know what to answer , and Lanny , with his best society smile , took the chance to intervene again . " Come , come , Monsieur le Commissaire , let us not prolong the argument unduly . You have the word of honor of the representative of the American government that there has been no black-marketing or smuggling here . You have my word , and you might have the word of these French officers . " The two lieutenants had sunk their heads in their arms on the table and were supposed to be in a stupor . Lanny went over to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the commissaire that there have been no contrebandiers here . " " Contrebandiers ? " echoed the other . He started up , swaying slightly and looking dazed . " Oft sont les contrebandiers ? " Lanny said : " They think that we are contrebandiers . " " Who thinks that we are contrebandiers ? " The young officer was ready for combat . " Tell the commissaire that there have been no contrebandiers here . " " Non ! Pas de contrebandiers . " The officer was as emphatic as could be desired . " You see , Monsieur le Commissaire . These gentlemen are officers in your country 's Army . Surely you can not wish to push this matter further . "   " I am not sure that I have the authority , Monsieur . I shall report the matter to my superiors . " " And so shall we , Monsieur . In the meantime , let us drink to the welfare and friendship of our two countries . " He went to the table and picked out a bottle of burgundy . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and handed it ceremoniously to the commissaire . He poured for the others , and proposed a toast , and they all drank . After that there could be no more argument , and the three policemen retired to their car . In the doorway the reluctant official served warning : " My superiors will come , Messieurs . " He did n't have to say that , and the thought flashed through Lanny 's mind : Can it be that he has guessed correctly , and that he is on our side in the situation ? The car turned , and drove to the highway , and its lights disappeared to the east . Lannv did n't wait to see the raiders come out of their hiding-place , but closed the gate and resumed his vigil outside . He stayed there , a faithful Cerberus , the whole night long , and this time did not sleep . Afterward he learned what had been happening . The raiders had wanted to get away with their precious freight at the earliest moment , and had lugged their collapsible boats down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had a powerful blue torch with which they signaled the submarine , and the order was : " Come as close to the shore as possible . We are in trouble . " The first to make a try was General Clark . He took off his outer clothing and rolled it into a bundle , and he and a British commando captain walked out into the surf . Clark , a powerful man , six-feet-three , got into the frail walnut shell ; the other man followed , and they began paddling like mad . A tall comber came sweeping in , seized the tiny boat , turned it up on end , threw it over and back toward the beach . " Save the General 's pants ! " somebody shouted , and the reply was : " Hell , no , save the paddles ! " This they managed to do ; but the pants were gone , and somewhere in the boiling surf was a musette bag containingsix hundred dollars in gold . When this story reached the newspapers , the amount had been increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a quantity of gold would weigh about sixty pounds and would have been rather difficult to transport in a kayak . P349They saw that nothing could be done with that surf . Clark decided that they would not trap themselves in a cellar again ; they would hide the boats in the underbrush and themselves in the woods . There was a new problem in military etiquette : the commanding officer could n't be left without pants , so the next in rank gave up his , and this politenessran down the line until there was left a forlorn lieutenant who had to wrap himself in a blanket . The night was chilly , and now they were hungry and longed for the chickens . They sat in the darkness with carbines or tommy guns on their knees and debated what to do next . At eleven o'clock came the lights of another car , and Lanny gave the alarm . This time higher officials had come , and the whole farce comedy was played over again . In spite of all protests , they insisted upon searching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , but the wine cellar was found empty and there were no boats in the kitchen . Murphy stated that his guests had departed , and that was all there was to that . The police , of course , knew that there were woods close by , but they could n't have done much searching at night . They stated that they would return in the morning ; and again Lanny wondered , did this mean that they did n't want to find out too much ? Anyhow , it was notice to get out before day , and the raiders hiding in the woods were shivering with more than cold . One of the Britishers , trained to amphibious operations , roamed the beach and found a spot where there appeared to be a riptide , and he persuaded General Clark that an attempt might succeed there . So once more the tiny boats were made ready ; the submarine was ordered to come still closer , and this time the commandos tried the method of posting themselves one on each side of the General 's kayak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , and then giving it a parting shove . By this means the little craft got enough headway to surmount the first comber , and it disappeared into the darkness . The second boat was overturned , but it got away on the next try , and the other two managed it with the help of Knight and the young Frenchmen . Out by the submarine one boat was smashed to bits against the side . This presented a new problem , for it had contained uniforms and a bag with papers , and when these and the boat fragments were washed ashore it would be a dead giveaway . The sub signaled to Murphy to clean up the beach , and he and the vice-consul got the boat fragments and other debris , tore them to pieces , and buried them in the sand . They did not find the gold , but they did find General Clark 's pants , and wrung them out and wrapped them up and locked them in the trunk of the consulate car . When they climbed the bluff , Murphy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of thorns and cuts . They were just in time , for Lanny gave the alarm again ; there were cars coming , two of them this time . The Americans had done their job , and a high diplomatic official felt justified in standing upon the dignity of his office . " Gentlemen , " he said , " since I am not free to entertainmy friends without repeated annoyance , I retire from the field . The house is yours , and I am going back to Algiers . " The other two Americans were already in the car . The French lieutenants had betaken themselves to the woods . Once out on the highway , Robert Murphy wiped from his forehead the mixture of perspiration and sea salt . A religious man , he permitted himself to exclaim : " Thank God ! " As for Lanny Budd , he could hardly keep awake , but he ventured the opinion that what had been done in the last two nights would be told in the history books along with Paul Revere 's ride and that of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ! " LANNY wrote a report to the Chief about French co-operation and the various details that he had picked up in Algiers . He told him that the general belief was that there would be an expedition to Dakar ; also , that the Vichy-controlled newspapers were predicting a Mediterranean expedition , having as its aim the taking of Crete . There was also a lot of talk about Norway , and what purported to be an inside story , that newspaper correspondents in London were providing themselves with fur coats and mittens . When Murphy read that he smiled and said : " They really are , you know . They have been told it 's Norway ! " Lanny added in his report that the French had apparently settled in their minds that D.day was to be the end of November . WhenP351Murphy read that he remarked : " Nobody here knows the date but myself , and I am under orders not to tell anyone until the proper time . " Lanny 's reply was : " I much prefer not to know any fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Counselor asked what Lanny was intending to do now , and the P.A. said that he had in mind to fly to Casablanca and ascertain how his Dakar scheme was going . He said : " I 'll have to come back here to file a report , as I do n't care to trust the mails . How long shall I stay ? " That was a " leading " question , and the other might have said that it was for Lanny to decide . Instead he smiled and replied : " I would n't stay more than a week or ten days if I were you . " Lanny did not fail to make note of both the words and the manner . " I 'll tell you something interesting , " the other continued . " The plans which the French had prepared for a proposed invasion of their territory correspond almost exactly with those which our Allied CombinedChiefs of Staff had worked out . General Clark did n't tell them that , of course . There was only one important difference : they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to take Oran , and then backtrack on land . " " That is exactly what General Bethouart suggested to me , " replied the P.A. " I find very few who think that we can land on the Atlantic coast , because of the surf . " " They do n't know the new devices we have prepared . They will be surprised , and so will the Germans . " " I was told about the landing craft by my half-brothers , back in Connecticut , " said Lanny . " I am waiting on pins and needles . " " We have all been waiting more than three years , " remarked the Counselor . And Lanny exclaimed : " I have been waiting ever since the day Hitler took power , and that lacks only a couple of months of being ten years . I am indignant when I think how that man has dominatedmy life ! " The plane to Morocco went via Oran , and it flew along the coast , over the town of Cherchell , and almost directly over the house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it as if it were a map , one drawn in indelible ink on the tablets of his memory . He looked down on the gray thread which was the route rationale , and in his mind were yet other images , stamped by that faculty known as imagination . He saw that sixteen-foot-wide highway crowded with tanks and trucks , and with long thin files of G.I. 's marching at the side . And they were n't backtracking to Casablanca , no indeed ! On all the roads of French North Africa their faces were turned toward the rising sun . They would n't be aiming to occupy two million square miles of territory ; they would be heading for Tunis , the great German supply base , and for the armies of General Rommel , intending to smash them and surround them and force them to surrender . Lanny did n't need to ask any military man about that ; he had learned the technique of war by watching the Germans , who had done it in a couple of months in France , and had been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had come to Stalingrad ! In Casablanca , Lanny sat down with his old friend Jerry , who was in a state of delight over the job he was doing . He had disliked the " Heinies " in World War I and now he heartily loathed the " Krauts " and enjoyed a chance to thwart them . He reported that the Chicago archeologist had done a perfect job ; he had been accepted as a Nazi sympathizer and spy , and was feeding them whatever the vice-consuls wanted them to get . " Of course there 's no telling till the showdown comes , but if the German wolfpacks are n't heading for Dakar I 'm a lobster and ready to be boiled . " Jerry had a mass of information which he himself had collected ; most of it had been turned over to the vice-consuls and had gone to Washington by the diplomatic pouches . The conscientious Lanny made mental note of a few items which he thought might be of special interest to the Governor . Lanny had adopted the practice of numberingthe items , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over them in his mind . If he forgot one he would be greatly distressed , and would give powerful commands to his subconscious mind to returnit to him . Hajek always followed , for the Moor was not only perfect camouflage , but also an errand boy and a fountain of gossip . It was permissiblefor an American gentleman of wealth and nothing special on his mind to be interested in all the rumors that were circulating in the souks . Not all of them were true , but a large percentage were , and the rest were what the different governments were giving out ; it was important to see what effect they were having . Everybody " knew " that the Americans were heading for Dakar , and it was generally expected that the U-boats would sink most of their ships ; everybody " knew " about the Sahara railroad heading for that port , and " knew " that it was about three times as near to completion as it actually was . Everybody " knew " that the British and American warships were already at Gibraltar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P353The pair were driven up to Marrakech , and Lanny made sure that his family was getting along contentedly . Beauty , too , had heard about Dakar , but she was n't so sure , having lived through some seven years of war and forty years of propaganda on the old Continent of Europe . She wanted Lanny to tell her , but he said that he did n't know , and if he did he would n't be free to say . He had a seance with Madame , to see if the " spirits " had anything to contribute ; but the only " spirit " was old Zaharoff , getting the two World Wars mixed in his mind and being blamed for them both . Lanny looked at some mosaics and some fountains , and had another private chat with Herr Theodor Auer and a couple of his friends . Oddly enough , he discovered that the souks knew that this gentleman was at odds with his own government and was not averse to being captured by the Americans if they did n't delaytoo long . Lanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and played the piano for some of Beauty 's friends who enjoyed it . With his Moorishfriends he drank many more cups of mint tea , which most white people considered a horrid concoction . Then he went hack to Casablanca , and after another conference with General Bethouart , returned to Algiers . He wrote his report , and the Counselor came as usual to read it . Lanny said : " Murphy , I am thinking of following this report personally . I am supposed to return every two or three months . And I have a personal reason , too : my wife is expecting a baby , and I 'd like to be at her side . " " Of course you are the one to decide , " replied the nervous and overstrainedofficial . " But you will want to consider the news which I am now free to tell a few of our most trusted people : D-day for OperationTorch is next Sunday , and H-hour is one A.M. " Lanny said : " Holy smoke ! " Of course the news knocked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but write a letter of apology to Laurel . That was Thursday afternoon , so Lanny had some fifty-six hours of suspense to pass . He was told the names of the men who had so far been trusted with the secret : General Juin , and his subordinate Mast , who , because he was very thin , was known in the American code as " Flagpole . " Lemaigre was " Crusoe , " and his henchman Rigault was " Friday . " Lanny was told that he might impart the secret to his friend Denis de Bruyne . It was being released to persons who had specific jobs to do in advance . One of the vice-consuls , Kenneth Pendar , had set out on an automobile expedition through French Morocco to impartit to officers of the French Army and Navy who were known to be on the Allied side . Murphy said : " We figure there wo n't be time for submarines to come up from Dakar now . " " Do n't forget the planes , " warned Lanny , and the other exclaimed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our last convoy to Malta . But fortunately their bases are not so near to our landing points . " " Unless they fly from Spain , " warned the P.A.He had an interesting contribution on that subject . Just before leavingCasablanca he had got into a chat with a Spanish consular official who was obviously desirous of pumping him . Lanny had taken his pose of old-time Fascist sympathizer , a friend of General Aguilar ; so the Spaniard had talked and revealed that El Caudillo was being pulled this way and that by his advisers , as to whether the Spanish armies should seize the moment to march into French Morocco , block off the Allies , and take the rich territory for their own . So simple it seemed , and then they could take the Rock , with German help if necessary . Some of those magnificent big guns which Marshal Goring had set up had been sitting there idle for more than a year , covered with grease and with their muzzles plugged ! " What have they decided ? " inquired the anxious Counselor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that they will wait and see the result of our efforts . If we are thrown back , it will be the chance of a lifetime for them . " " We are not going to be thrown back , " declared Murphy . He was an American , and so was Lanny , and Americans have the habit of thinking that their country can never fail in what it sets out to do . Battles can be lost , mistakes can be made , long delays can occur , but once America gets going she will not be stopped . Once that huge armada had set out from her many ports , once the sealed orders had been opened and read , the tremendous job would be put through , in spite of everything that Vichy French and Nazi Germans and Franco Spaniards could do . The turn of the tide was beginning , and not only in Algeria . Murphy confirmed the fact that the British had won a tremendous victory at El Alamein . Lanny had been afraid to believe it ; he had been disappointedso many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand miles of African coastline . But the new tank-killersP355had really killed ; the German armies had been routed and were in full retreat out of Egypt , harried day and night by swarms of British and American planes . The Desert Fox himself was n't there ; he had gone to Berlin to be feted and have decorations pinned on him . By the time he got back , he would have only part of an army . The P.A. heard with delight about the war bulletin which the Nazis had published , stating that " Rommel 's forces are advancing westward according to plan and without opposition " ! Also , the Russians were holding at Stalingrad ; they had been backed up against the Volga on a long front , and were clinging there desperately , reinforced and supplied across the river by night . The city and its giant factories were one vast line of ruins , extending for twenty miles along the west bank of the Volga . The discovery had been made in this war that concrete and steel buildings , hammered into ruins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while bombardment is going on , and when it stops they come up and hide behind steel girders and concrete blocks and defend their fortress with rifles and machine guns and grenades . They can fight in tropical jungles , too , in a tangle of vegetation so dense and so full of thorns and diseases and poisonous insects and snakes that it had been thought no man could penetrate it . But soldiers could camouflage their clothing and faces and hide there and fight . The Americans were proving it in New Guinea , which was a way of defending Australia ; the handful of marines that had been put ashore on terrible Guadalcanal were holding on in spite of Japanese bombing every night . Lanny had been there , just a year ago , and had learned about " Solomon sores , " which were all but impossible to heal ; half of the G.I. 's had them , but they were sticking it out , and the ships in " the Slot " and the flyers overhead were fighting deadly duels night after night . . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the greatest assemblage of ships in the world 's history was approaching the shores of Africa , to establish bases for an attack upon the " soft underbelly " of Europe . The Russians declared that they would refuse to consider this a " second front , " and that was their privilege ; to the Americans it was a " first front , " the first American front . It was their first large-scale action , and they would learn here , and making their mistakes in places where they would not be so costly . By the time they had conquered North Africa they would be veterans and would no longer make mistakes . That had been the decision , the result of the meeting of many minds , both British and American . Now came the time for action , for the carrying out of the unimaginably elaborate plans . The Americans who shared the secret were like children who can hardly bear to wait for Christmas morning . Lanny would have liked nothing better than to throw off his camouflageand take part in this high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had to keep out of the way , and meet secretly with his friend Denis and learn from him what the conspirators were doing . Denis would pop in- like a jack-in-the-box , so excited that French words rolled off his tongue like bullets out of a tommy gun . He wanted advice , because he had looked up to Lanny from boyhood , and besides , Lanny knew the Americans and what they would be apt to do in this or that contingency . The center of the intrigue was the home of the Jewish professordoctoron the Rue Michelet . He was seventy-eight , a big man , with a leg hurt in World War I ; he could not get about without a cane . he was wise , and had money , and also courage , so the others listened to him . Robert Murphy had come there and imparted the secret to a dependablehalf-dozen , and they had agreed upon all the things that were to be done on the Saturday night before D-day . As it turned out , a great part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who hated Vichy to the point where they were willing to risk their lives to get rid of it . The reason was the odious anti-Semitic laws which the Nazis had forced upon Vichy and which Vichy had forced upon all France , including the colonies . Professor Aboulker was President of the Jewish Federation of Algeriaand also a professor of medicine at the university ; he was allowed to continue at this post because he was a wounded veteran , and thereforewas exempt from the laws which excluded Jews from the professions . Prominent also in the movement were Aboulker 's sons , the sons ' cousins , and a couturier by the name of Cohen , who in business used the name Elie Calvet ; short , dark , and energetic , he owned a dressmaking establishment in Paris , and had shops in the four principal cities of French North Africa where he sold his products . So far he had been able to hold onto the business ; he was counting the days before he would have it safe under American protection . Denis , wearing civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without attracting attention . He was in touch with the French officers , and reported that Admiral Darlan had arrived unexpectedly in Algiers . P357The stocky commander of both Navy and Army forces  --  under Petain , but no one else  --  had made an inspection trip throughout North Africa , including Dakar , which all Vichy now expected to be attacked . He had returned to Vichy , but because of the serious illness of his son he had been flown back to Algiers . Lanny wondered , had he been " tipped off " to what was coming ? Denis did n't think that was the case . Another item of information : the Americans were planning to use General Giraud in their efforts to avoid bloodshed here . This aged hero of both world wars had escaped from a German fortress into Vichy France ; then he had gone to the Riviera , and from there had been taken in a submarine to Gibraltar . As soon as the Americans were ashore he would be flown to Algiers , and would invite the French to accept him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny asked ; and the reply was : " It seems to nie a bad guess . " Lanny did n't ask any further , for he knew that Denis , a Gaullist , would not accept anybody but his Joan of Arc . The capitaine was greatly upset because the Americans were not bringing De Gaulle from London ; but when Lanny pinned him down he admitted that the tall radio orator had very little following in North Africa , and that most of the French military regarded him as a British tool . Lanny considered De Gaulle a Jesuit imperialist , but all he could say was : " You know , Denis , I am no politician , and I 'm not in the confidence of our military men . I can only guess their attitude , that they will do anything on earth to avoid having to shed French blood . Whoever can best help them in that may become civil governor of French Africa . " The actors in the coup for Algiers were for the most part the Chantiersde la Jeunesse , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Algiers with the boy scouts . These youths  --  up to the age of eighteen  --  had been provided with American small arms and had buried them . Now they were told to dig them up and to report at their assembly places at eleven o'clock on Saturday night . Lanny went out to see the show , and discovered that the people of this " African Paris " were enjoying themselves after the fashion of all Mediterranean peoples , who turn night into day as far as they can . The radio had reported an immense Allied convoy , first leaving Gibraltar , and then moving eastward through the middle of the Mediterranean , the established route to Malta and the strait of Sicily . It was assumed that this meant another effort to reinforce the most bomb- battered spot in the world . No one could observe in the darkness that this convoy , due north of Algiers , made a right-angled turn to starboardand was now heading straight for the city , whose harbor and beaches had been photographed and reproduced in replica and studied until everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own back yard . The band was playing in the park down by the waterfront , and the Rue Michelet , the principal street , was thronged with sightseers . All the shops were open , and there were lines in front of the movie houses ; American pictures were barred , of course , but the crowds took what they could get . Here , as all over the world , any movie was better than no movie . Groups of the Chantiers in their green trousers strolled past , but nobody paid any special attention to them . H-hour was one in the morning . At that time the ships were supposedto be as close to the shore as possible , the landing craft launched , the men on board , and the craft with engines idling , ready on the second to begin the race to the shore . Ten thousand men were coming , not into the harbor , but to beaches just west of the city ; they would march in by the roads . Some of the conspirators were at the beaches , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of all the important points of the city : the post office , which contained the telegraph and telephone offices ; the power stations , the radio stations , the Prefecture de Police . They were to hold these and permit nobody to come or go until the American forces arrived . Lanny stood in the crowd outside this last all-important place and watched what was happening . He learned once more the lesson that events of historic moment are frequently poor shows to the spectator . He watched , and nothing happened , except that young men with revolversin their hands stood in the doorway , looking very solemn and determined . He did not learn until later that inside the building the chief of the secret police was down on his knees , trembling and pleadingwith tears in his eyes that he should not be shot . He well knew what he deserved to get from anti-Fascists and Jews . All kinds of political opinions were represented in these groups , but they all hated Germans and friends of Germans . Lanny strolled from one place to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the pro-Allies . Planes flew close overhead , and showers of leaflets came fluttering down ; Lanny picked one up and found that it had the American flag on it , but was printed in Arabic . Shortly afterward he stood in a crowd and listened while a man read aloud one that was printed in French ; it was a proclamationp359by General Giraud , calling upon the Army to make no resistance to their American allies . A little later the P.A. had the strange experience , while walking on the Rue Michelet , of hearing from an open cafe the sound of a familiar voice , booming with tremendous volume from a radio set . All activity had come to a halt , and the Algerians listened to Franklin D. Roosevelt , assuring them in careful college French that the sole purpose of the American Army was " to liberate France and the French Empire from the Axis yoke " and to " bring about the early destruction of our commonenemy . " This was from a recording , and Lanny heard it more than once during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Eisenhower . That , too , sounded strangely familiar , and he realized that it was a voice he had heard from the underbrush near Cherchell . It was Colonel Julius Holmes , doubling for his overworked commander ! But where were the Americans ? He was told later that there had been a mistake , and that in the darkness the landing craft had hit some beaches farther away from town . Maybe that was true ; anyhow , some of the officials who had n't been caught in the coup had warned the French troops in the suburbs , and these troops now came rushing in with motor transport . In the next hour or two several of the proAlliedgroups were under siege in the buildings they had taken . They were outnumbered , and the troops had artillery , so a few of the insurgentswere killed and others had to surrender . So much for amateur war-making ! It was n't quite as bad as it appeared that morning , but Lanny was greatly upset . There was nothing he could do about it , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been burning confidential records and codebooks all day Friday and Saturday , as a precaution against just such a mishap . Sooner or later the Army would get here , and if there was fighting to be done , the Army would know how to do it . Meantime the one clear duty of a P.A. was to keep out of sight and out of range . An exhausted art expert went back to his hotel and fell asleep to the sound of several kinds of gun fire . That was just before dawn , and he slept for two or three hours . He was awakened by a tap upon his door , and when he opened it , there was Denis de Bruyne , haggard , redeyed , and in a terrible state of depression . He had been in the battle at the Prefecture , and had made his escape by jumping out of a back window . Since then he had been roaming the streets , not daring to goP360to his home . So many of his friends were in the hands of the enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save that they would all be shot . Lanny brought him inside and locked the door , and they discussed the situation in low tones . Lanny did n't think it could be as bad as his friend feared . " They know the Americans are coming , Denis . " " But where are the Americans ? " burst out the other . " You have n't seen any of them ? " " Nobody has seen them that I can find out . They are shooting some guns , but they do n't march . " " You may be sure they have their orders , Denis . Their first objectiveswould be the airports , and the installations of heavy guns . As a military man , you know that they would make certain of such objectivesbefore they started marching down a city boulevard at night . " " That may be true ; but then , they should not have told us to go into action at midnight . " " Murphy told you ; and Murphy is not a military man . The commanderswill necessarily be guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting from the direction of Maison Blanche . " This was the larger of the two airports of Algiers . " I heard it also from the Blida airport . I suppose the defenders would have to fire a few volleys to satisfy their sense of honor . " " How many Americans do you think they will have to kill in order to satisfy their honor , Denis ? " It was an unkind question . The capitaine , in a state of extreme exhaustion , made no attempt to wipe away the tears which welled into his eyes . " Lanny , you know how I feel about it . I am in despair , because I am so impotent . Several times I have been on the verge of going to the authorities and pleading with them . Every decent Frenchmanhas a love for America buried somewhere in his heart , ever since your war with England when we helped you in good friendship . But these Vichy people have the hearts of rats , and they would probably throw me into jail . " " Whom did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darlan . " " Darlan ! " echoed the astonished P.A. " Of all men ! " " He is the one who can prevent a war , or stop it if it has started . " " You do n't think . Giraud can do it ? " " Not a chance in this world . I have talked about him with scores of our officers , and they all say they would pay no attention to him . " " And Juin can not control them ? "   " Juin would never dare to give an order contrary to Darlan 's . Darlanis his superior . " " It goes entirely by rank , then ? " " It goes by rank in every army , Lanny . If a man defies his superior officer , he is a mutineer and he is shot . " " But you , Denis , you are a Gaullist ! Is that mutiny ? " " It is revolution , at least , and De Gaulle would be shot by the Vichy crowd if they could get him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Certainly . " " And yet you would appeal to Darlan ! " " I would be appealing for the Americans , Lanny . You do n't have to deal with the question of French legitimacy , you only have to considerAmerican lives and how to save them . What I am trying to do is to save the lives of those Chantiers who are now in the hands of the Garde Mobile . Tomorrow may be .00 late . " " You understand , Denis , if we were to make terms with Darlan he would certainly demand control . He would remain at the head of the French Army and might even dominate the civil government . " " I would n't worry about any of that . Once the Americans have their armies in here and are firmly settled , they could give orders to Darlan , and if he did n't obey them they could kick him out . " Lanny found this one of the strangest developments in this complexityof greeds and jealousies and fears . A fighting Gaullist recommendingone of the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Darlan is not for Vichy . Darlan is for Darlan ! If you brought him such an offer , he would think of just one thing , what forces you were bringing and what chance you had of staying . If you stay , and he is against you , he is a prisoner of war ; but if he helps you , he becomes the governor of an immense province , and perhaps  --  who can say ?  --  of all France . " " And you are willing to take that chance ? " " What I wanted , Lanny , was for you to bring General de Gaulle here with your armies and put him in authority . But for some reason your President does not understand our great General and does not trust him . Even so , I trust your President . If the selfish and cynical Darlan can bring it about that the American Armv will fight Germans instead of Frenchmen  --  all right , I am willing , and I will take my chances that in the end the people of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that will be De Gaulle ! " The P.A. thought that over for a while , and then said : " I 'll go and talk with Robert Murphy . " He bade his friend to lock himself in this room and have a sleep . Lanny would hang the " Do Not Disturb " sign outside the door and Denis would be all right , even with the headquartersof French Naval Intelligence in this same hotel ! The P.A. went out on the streets of Algiers on a beautiful Sunday morning . The European shops were closed , but you could n't exactly say that it was quiet , with guns large and small going off at the harbor and now and then in the suburbs . Crowds of people , both white and brown , had come out to see what was happening , and there were swarms of soldiers of the Garde Mobile . Lanny observed that they were still besieging the post office , which had refused to surrender . A small British war vessel had forced its way in during the night , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the harbor , he saw the first of the long-awaited American troops , a company of commandomen , making their toilsome way up one of the steep streets . All of them were heavily camouflaged , with hands and faces black except around the eyes . The Moors stared at them in wonder , no doubt taking them for some new and strange kind of savages . Soon afterward Lanny saw a column of infantry marching in from the west . They had had difficulty in getting ashore in rough water , and they looked exhausted after a long march with heavy packs . They plodded along , manifesting little interest in the sights of a strange city . Few cheered then , for who could know if it was safe to do so ? Frenchmenremembered Dieppe , and before that St. Nazaire . High and low had the same idea : better to wait and see how things turned out ! Lanny went to the home of Professor Aboulker ; he found nobody there except one American official who had imbibed too heavily amid the excitement of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and claiming to have been the first soldier to enter the city . Lanny used the telephone to call the Counselor 's home , but Murphy was n't there ; he tried the British Consulate , which was opposite the Admiralty building , but Murphy was n't at that place either . Lanny spent a lot of time looking for him ; and in that time he saw three Allied planes bombing targets in the harbor , and large fires starting up . It was all very confusing to him , and even more so to other people . Certainly that was true of the G.I. 's with whom he chatted as they rested in the park . " Some frog soldiers give us wine , P363some give us black looks , and some shoot at us . Tell me , Mister , is this a war or what is it ? " Toward noon Lanny decided to see what was going on at the Prefecture , so he strolled on the Boulevard Boudin . There he happened to see a parked automobile which he recognized  --  there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited , and presently from the building came Vice-Consul Pendar , a Harvard man whom Lannv had met at a social affair , and with whom he had got along very well because of Pendar 's interest in art . Now Lanny greeted him , saying : " How are things going ? " The answer was : " I would tell you if I knew . " When Lanny said that he could n't make heads or tails of it , the vice-consul replied that it appeared to be mostly tail and very little head . Lanny explained that he had been trying to get in touch with Murphy , and the other 's response took him by surprise : " Murphy is a prisoner of General Juin . " " Prisoner ! " Lanny exclaimed . " In heaven 's name ! " " Do n't take it too seriously . The town is a madhouse . When the French think that our troops are delaying they arrest us , and when they hear that our troops are ashore they turn us loose , and we arrest them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times since midnight . Just now I have a pass from Commandant d'Orange , Juin 's aidede-camp , but I do n't know how long it will be good . " When Lanny said that he had a message for the Counselor that might be important , the other said : " Why not telephone him at Juin 's villa ? " When Lanny expressed surprise at this suggestion , he was told that the diplomatic head was busily carrying on negotiations , just as Juin had been carrying on negotiations while he was Murphy 's prisoner . An odd melodrama indeed ! The vice-consul explained that he could n't stop for a chat as he was on an important errand . " You might ride with me if you like . I 'll be seeing Murphy in the next hour or two , if that 's not too late . " Lanny stepped into the car , and as he drove Pendar explained the errand on which he had been hurrying about town ; he was trying to find Admiral Battet , who had been taken prisoner by the insurgents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adviser , " said the viceconsul , " and Darlan refuses to negotiate without him . " " Oh ! You are negotiating with Darlan ? " inquired the P.A. " Naturally . He is in our hands and he knows it . At least , he 's coming to know it . " Lanny did n't say : " That is what I wanted to talk to Murphy about . " He had long ago learned to let the other fellow talk when the other fellow was willing . Said he : " Do you think that the Admiral came to Algiers for that purpose ? " " I do n't know . He is supposed to be here on account of his sick son , but it is possible for a man to have more than one motive . He must be ' aware that the Vichy ship is foundering . Murphy has been arguing with him until both of them are worn ragged . All this shooting is because he ca n't make up his mind which way the cat is going to jump . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no question about that . All the French officers consider him their military chief . He is Petain 's deputy , and they are prepared to be told that Petain is Hitler 's prisoner and is not a free agent . Darlan 's word will stop the resistance , not merely here but at Oran and Casablanca , and it might even get us Dakar and the French Fleet . " " You are indeed playing for high stakes , Mr. Pendar . " " Indeed yes , " said the vice-consul . " Bob Murphy never asked for this and he was n't trained for it ; he 's been dropped into the middle of a cyclone . He 'll tell you he 's scared stiff , but so far he 's handled himselfvery well . He acts as if placing admirals and generals under house arrest was an everyday affair in the lives of American career diplo-mats . " In the course of this drive Lanny heard the story of what had been happening to the American diplomatic corps that night . They had been dealing with French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crisis appeared to be hysterical . General Juin , for example , commander of the troops in all North Africa , had promisedsolemnly to support the landing ; but he was also under oath to the Germans not to bear arms against them ; and suddenly Darlan had appeared , and a mind trained to authority was paralyzed by the fact that Darlan was his superior and a representative of the revered old Marechal . Moreover every French officer quailed at the thought of another commando raid ; the raiders would depart in their ships and leave their friends on shore to lose , not merely their jobs , not merely their necks , but their military honor . The Americans had kept the time of their coming a secret , very unfair indeed ; and who could know how manyP365ships they had , how many men , and how serious was their purpose ? No doubt they were exaggerating their forces . Pendar smiled as he admitted : " We are exaggerating them not more than three times . " The bewildered Frenchmen argued and changed their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they became more nervous . They scolded and screamed and even wept  --  behavior that AngloSaxonswere supposed never to indulge in . Soon after midnight Murphy and Pendar had gone to Juin 's home , the Villa des Oliviers , in a high suburb of the city , called El-Biar . Pendar was sent to bring Admirals Darlan and Battet , who were stayingat the home of Admiral Fenard . This he did , and then stayed out in the garden , keeping watch . Presently there arrived a troop of insurgents , sent by someone , Pendar did n't know whom . They posted themselves about the house and announced that nobody would be allowed to leave , save only Pendar , whom they knew . When the mighty admirals and generals made this discovery they were naturally indignant and unwilling to accept the word of Murphy and Pendar that they had no idea who had sent these gun-toters . When the American troops did not show up , the same thing happenedat this villa as in town ; members of the Garde Mobile rushed into the garden and captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porter 's lodge with their hands in the air and were thoroughly searched and had their papers taken . They were rescued by Commandant d'Orange , and General Juin ordered them brought back into the villa where the debate was resumed . Admiral Darlan had written a telegram which he wanted sent to Petain , and Pendar was assigned to take it to the Admiralty . Members of the Garde Mobile escorted him there , and on the way he made the extraordinary discovery that the guards had been told that it was Germans who had surrounded the villa and Germans who were attacking Algiers . At the Admiralty another admiral , Leclerc , refused to believe that the signature was Darlan 's , so Pendar was a prisoner again while Leclerc sent to the Villa des Oliviers to make sure . The Admiralty is down near the harbor , so the young gentleman out of Harvard spent
