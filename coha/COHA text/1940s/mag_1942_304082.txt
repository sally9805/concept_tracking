To destroy the last tough remnant of U.S. resistance in the Philippines the Jap was willing to pay dearly . So last week , the sixth of the Battle of Luzon , he lashed fiercely at General Douglas MacArthur 's tough little Army . MacArthur 's men , holed up in the mountain-wild Bataan peninsula with an anchor below on the island fortress of Corregidor in Manila Bay , gave better than they received . <P> The enemy banged hardest at MacArthur 's right flank , apparently to grab a toehold on the highway leading south on Bataan 's east shore . He was hurled back with heavy losses . Meanwhile he stabbed tentatively through the mountains on the west shore , and near week 's end he reported landing seaborne forces on Subic Bay . If he was telling the truth nothing immediately came of it . Douglas MacArthur was able to report that " enemy pressure ... in the Bataan peninsula has lessened . " <P> No one thought that the Jap had quit . No one thought seriously that MacArthur 's men were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the U.S. Army Forces in the Far East were on their feet the fight would go on , blackly determined in action , flecked with the fine gold of good American humor when it got a breathing spell . <P> In all except the front-line areas , the worst nuisance and the most pregnant occasion for levity were intermittent bombings by the Jap . " Keep ' em falling " became the anti-aircraft gunner 's slogan . Melville Jacoby .

Sometimes we sense planes coming before the alarm sounds . Then a shout echoes from dugout to dugout : ' Tojo 's coming . ' <P> " On the ground everyone except the gun crews takes cover , but everybody watches the sky . Everyone is keyed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear sky . They sound like tearing sheets or crackling fire . Then it 's time to duck . As you duck you think of what the soldiers say : ' Do n't be worried about the bomb that 's labeled with your name . The ones to worry about are the ones labeled To Whom it May Concern . ' <P> " The sound of exploding anti-aircraft shells is music to soldiers ' eafs . They say they 'd rather hear it than Tommy Dorsey 's band . USAFFE headquarters issues a daily news bulletin which features ' Today 's Scoreboard , ' telling the number of planes shot down to date . " <P> At week 's end , Douglas MacArthur reported to Washington that six weeks of hard fighting had made veterans of his U.S. soldiers and Filipinos : " Their training in the difficult school of actual combat and their battle experience have steadied them and developed their initiative and resourcefulness .
