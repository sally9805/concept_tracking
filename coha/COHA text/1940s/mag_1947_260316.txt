What ought a Christian to mean by " the church " ? Speaking before the Chicago Church Federation , TIME &; LIFE Editor Henry Robinson Luce joined the growing ranks of Protestants who are raising this pertinent question . This week , the Christian Century published Layman Luce 's speech . Excerpts : , " Between us and the early church is the obvious difference that we Christians have become a great thing in the world . They were the leaven in the lump ; we have become the lump . ... If today the laws of human society are not in conformity with the will of God , we can not say that it is because God has not given us enough votes ! ... To have such power and not use it is certainly to be wicked and unprofitable servants , good for nothing except to be cast into outer darkness ; to have this power and use it is certainly to become involved in sinful corruptions ... <P> " It is , I think , precisely by facing this dilemma that we can begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what it necessarily must be . The church on earth must be a church that can cope with history . . . . <P> " How does the church cope with history ? . . . The first and everlasting mission of the church is to bring continuously the knowledge of God into the world and to bring the world to the knowledge of God . As men come to the knowledge of God , and especially as they come to the knowledge of God in communion with one another , they learn to distinguish ever more sharply between God 's will and man 's will , and they cope , powerfully and dramatically so many people were inquiring , sincerely , whether any knowledge of God exists or can exist . This is the incredibly great opportunity which now confronts the church of God . . . . <P> " First , Protestantism requires a stronger and better theology . . . . And we may give thanks to God that there is now rising mightily in the Protestant churches a stronger and more valiant theology . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades was a non-creedal , nontheological , nonecclesiastical Protestantism . It found many passages in the Scriptures to support its intellectually fuzzy , morally weak good-willism . It relied heavily , for example , on the thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians . If Protestants know anything , they know that thirteenth chapter-'But now abideth faith , hope , love , these three : and the greatest of these is love . ' But our attention ought also to be directed to the fourteenth chapter . In the fourteenth chapter of First Corinthians , following right after the glorious hymn to divine love , St. Paul is terribly concerned about order in the church-not so much ecclesiastical order as intellectual order . And in that chapter he makes this striking announcement about God : ' God is not the author of confusion . ' . . . "
