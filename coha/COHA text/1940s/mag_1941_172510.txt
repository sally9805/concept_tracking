Protesting against " the levity and lesemajest " of an editorial in the London Times about the late King George V 's spelling , an eminent Briton whose notions are always news wrote a letter to The Thunderer : <P> You have failed to appreciate . . . the laudable and sensible attempts of our Sovereign 's royal father to spelg the English language as it ought to be spelt . . . . The English language can not be spelt , because there is no English alphabet . We make shift with a Latin alphabet . . . . <P> Our attempts to make a foreign alphabet of 26 letters do the work of 42 are pitiable . We write the same vowel twice to give it a different sound . . . . We also double the following consonant ... or make two consonants represent simple sounds . . . for which the Latin alphabet does not provide . . . . Those who think this a satisfactory solution overlook the stupendous fact that it takes twice as long to write two letters as to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that your leading article contains 2,761 letters . As these letters represent only 2,311 sounds , 450 of them were superfluous and could have been saved had we a British alphabet . The same rate of waste on the 465,000,000 letters printed annually by the Times gives us 94,136,952* superfluous letters , every one of which has to be legibly written . . . read . . . set up . . . cast . . . and machined . . . . <P> The King has to spend an appreciable part of his time in signing his name , which should be spelt with three letters . . . with a result so equivocal that Herr Hitler speaks of him as King Gay Org . My surname has two sounds ; but I have to spell it with four letters . . . . What chance has a Power that can not spell so simple a sound as Shaw ? . . . <P> Yours truly , <P> G. Bernard Shaw <P> <P> *The mathematical calculations appear to be off by 4%.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
