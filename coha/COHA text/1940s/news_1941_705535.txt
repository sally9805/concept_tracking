txt Cause of National Headache On Page 1 of the May 4 issue of THE TIMES you quote from Lindbergh 's St. Louis speech : " Not only is the performance of some of our vital types of service aircraft inadequate , but our total air force in the United States today , including both Army and Navy , both modern and obsolescent types , is not more than Germany can produce in a few weeks . " Same page , same issue , right next to the foregoing you quote Colonel Knox : " In another ninety days the nation will be producing more war equipment than any other country in the world  --  including Germany . " If the country is wabbly today , it is such contradictions as these that have people wondering where the truth is . It is too bad that there is n't some organization that people can believe , but there seems to be none . Here is our confusion , our headache . FRANK W. . New York , May 6 , 1941.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
