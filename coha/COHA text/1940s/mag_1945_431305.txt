 | America 's World Chance By Eric : Johnston Presidnt of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States The last half of this century can and should be the most re-splendent economic era in human history ? the era of the industrialization and modernization of backward peoples . The profit to the United States would be prodigious . Industrialized countries are by far our best customers . Britain has a population of only 47,000,000 . In the last year of world peacetime prosperity -1 929 ? our exports to Britain were $841,000,000 . China has a population of 450,000,000 . In 1929 our exports to China were only $124,000,000 . Main reason : Britain is industrialized and has a relatively high income per person . China is unindustrialized and has a wretchedly low income per person . More than half of the world 's population ? more than 1,000,000 , - 000 human beings ? live in a state of miserable industrial backwardness and poverty . That is an immense challenging new frontier for modern economic audacity and development . At the outset , let me point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . If these seem fantastic , remember that I am not blueprinting the proximate future . I am looking beyond that , to a world inhabited by the generations which will follow us . To them , the limitations of the 1940 's will seem as unreal as those of colonial America seem to us today . For instance , if people everywhere used as much cotton per person as we use in the United States , the world 's production of cotton would have to be trebled . If people everywhere used as much soap per person as we use , production would have to be quadrupled . The United States has some 27,000 , - 000 telephones . It would be necessary to manufacture 350,000,000 telephones to bring the rest of the world up to the American standard of telephone use . The United States has some 57,000,000 radios . It would be necessary to manufacture 600 , - 000,000 to equip the rest of the world equivalently . One of America 's greatest opportunities for its own pocketbook lies in the promotion of world-wide wealth and welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its backwardness . Our fellow American William D. Fawley of the Intercontinent Corporation recently built India 's first airplane plant . A committee of inquiry had reported that Indians were not yet able to do such work . Mr. Fawley said he would train them to do it . He got together some 400 educated Indians , many of whom held degrees from universities in Britain ,  | the United States , Germany , France , " They took to aeronautical engineering , " says Mr. Pawley , " like ducks to water . " The American members of the staff numbered only 38 . The Indian employes ( engineers and workmen ) were ultimately 14,000 . They established India 's first real assembly line , and came to rival American records of production per man hour . At present the plant ? Hindustan Aircraft ? is used by the U. S. Army Air Force for the repair and maintenance of its aircraft in India . " My experience in India , " says Mr. Pawley , " has convinced me that India is destined to a tremendous industrial development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples are mentally and physically capable of doing higher work and more remunerative work than they are doing now . What they need first is capital . They all have some , but not enough . And where is capital most plentiful ? In the United States . IN THE United States we have surplus capital . One of the basic criticisms of our economic situation during the last two decades has been that we have surplus capital that remains idle . The backward countries are calling for it . I 'm not talking about gifts . Nor am I talking about loans . In loans the money gets spent by the foreign borrower with little or no control over it by the American lender . I am speaking of what is called direct investment . I am speaking of American money that goes into a foreign country and builds a plant which remains substantially under American direction and is operated with Amer-i lean skills of engineering and management . This is better for us becans then we can watch our money . It i better for a backward country because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital but of American know-how . At the outbreak of the war we Americans had almost $10,000,000 , - 000 in such direct investment abroad . I am convinced that this sum can I e multiplied advantageously many times in the near future . Every Latin-American country has a " Commission of Inter-American Development " preparing projects devised to be attractive to capital from the United States . The Joint Mexican-American Commission for Economic Cooperation has approved projects which in Mexico alone would require a capital expenditure of some $400,000,000 . On behalf of China the Chief Engineer of the U. S. Foreign Economic Administration , Alex Taub , has compiled a list of some i000 projects ? in mining and manufacturing and other fields ? offering an investment in China of approximately $1,000 , - 000,000 . The Chinese Government itself has projects which it believes could profitably use an investment of $4,000,000,000 in each of the ten years after the war . That sum seems huge , but it would have to be multiplied many times to give the Chinese as much industrial equipment as we Americans have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports to China in that year , instead of being $124,000 , - 000 , might have been over $8,000 , -  | , o , 000 . I see profit in that thar hill , , ' en if it should rise only to one half c one quarter of that height , profit for the dividends of American investors and profit for the wages of merican workingmen . But all this can happen only on one condition . No longer can surpluscapital countries , whether Britain , France or Belgium , the Netherlands , Sweden or the United States , invest in undeveloped countries and then suck out all the dividends . That kind of " economic imperialism " is everywhere either dying or already dead . The industrially backward countries resent it and will no longer tolerate it . What they want now ? and what they should have ? is a partnership of their local capital with foreign capital in the risks and profits of new enterprises on their soils . The change thus indicated is one of the most momentous in all the world 's long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exploitation " of backward countries is closed . We move into the age of cooperative effort by advanced countries and undeveloped countries together for mutual profit . I am happy and proud to say that this principle is already recognized as cardinal in the future economic development of the Americas . It is a principle which is already in broad action . For instance , the W. R. Grace Company of New York , famous for its pioneering work in transportation and trade along the west coast of South America , now has textile mills in Colombia , Peru and Chile , vegetable-oil and paint and sugar plants in Chile , and flour and cement mills in Bolivia . But these enterprises are not simply United States enterprises . They are also Colombian , Peruvian , Chilean , Bolivian enterprises . In all of them there are substantial stockholdings by local investors . In some of them , though the Grace Company provides the managerial direction , the local investors own a stock majority . These enterprises are not just transients from abroad . They are rooted in the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint enterprise with the local Chilean chemical company , Sanitas . In Mexico , Pan American Airways is operating through a local company in which the manager is from the United States . Mexicans hold 45 percent of the stock and occupy eight out of 11 seats on the board of directors . In Argentina there is a large glass company owned jointly by the Corning Glass Works , the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company and Argentine citizens . Dividends therefore go to citizens of both countries . But the big point I want to make here is not dividends but wages . The glass company 's 3800 employes , with the benefit of North American machinery and management , are earning roughly 6o percent higher wages than they ever earned before . What then ? Then they can buy more Argentine goods ; and then they can also buy more imported United States goods . Is this a matter of " profit-seeking " American business ? It is . Is it a matter of " profit-seeking " American labor ? It is . American labor leaders are interested in expanding American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed in-  | dustries , and tend to pay the highest wages . Outstanding illustrations are motorcars and rubber tires and machine tools . Labor leaders know that when we expand our export trade we increase the number of our best-paid workers . The investment of our surplus capital abroad enlarges our exports in two ways . First is what are called " producers ' goods " ? machinery and equipment . This wave of exports to undeveloped countries could go on for many decades . But it is the second wave that brings real human welfare with it for the peoples of these regions . This second wave almost instantly overlaps the first . As soon as the people of an undeveloped region begin to get the higher incomes that industrialization generates , they begin to buy more " consumers ' goods " : clothing , furniture , kitchen appliances , automobiles , radios and all the " gadgets " of modern living . We Americans are good at manufacturing both producers ' tools and consumers ' gadgets . We shall therefore profit handsomely on both waves of exports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands to win most out of an energetic industrialization of the total world . So MUCH for exports . Now for imports . They are essential . The foreign world can not get the dollars with which to buy our exports unless we pay dollars to the foreign world for imports . I then make two points . The first is that world-wide industrialization will increasingly diminish our fear of imports . What makes that fear ? " Cheap foreign labor . " But industrialization abroad , as we have seen , raises wages . As foreign wag are raised step by step toward the American level , we shall move u step by step out of our fear of imports The second point is that we nee numerous raw materials from abroad to go into the products we manufacture for export . We shall export more telephones . In every American phone there are 18 materials from foreign countries . We shall export more automobiles . In every American car there are 300 materials from 56 foreign lands . We lack certain raw materials Others , which we have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been one of the world 's greatest iron-ore countries Now , though , we are building the world 's biggest and fastest iron-ore -- carrying ships to fetch us iron ore all the way from Chile . Our export of manufactured products will compel us to import larger and larger quantities of copper , lead , zinc , petroleum , and many other materials . I make no " idealistic " approach to the problem of imports . I thin that in the coming decades we shall take more and more imports not at all because we ought to but because we shall need to and want to in order to promote our own prosperity . This policy ultimately will move the millions of backward people forward . And in the process let us not forget that we are helping ourselves , not only in the matter of profits and jobs and wages but in the matter of international good will and cooperation . Americans are going to be more genuinely and realistically interested in international affairs when they have more international interests .  | BuT the road ahead is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am referring to the inclination of many contemporary governments , including our own , to intrude themIves unnecessarily and excessively 1,1 to international investments of capit al and exchanges of goods . This inclination , if unchecked , would turn every government into a bitter economic competitor of every other government . It would change all the private trade contests of the world into contests between nations . It would change them into contests not of intelligence but of force . World development , if it is to be peaceful , must be accomplished by private effort . The capital of the investing countries should go abroad imply as personal private capital , not as an arm of nationalized economic aggression . A private risk is personal , hut a government risk involves a whole people and their national honor . Behind every diplomat stands the soldier , the sailor , the flag . Negotiations between governments are negotiations between rival arrays of national pride , prestige , power . The world has suffered enough from power politics . It could not possibly survive power economics . That road is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolishment of all " spheres of economic influence . " American capital should be welcome in Burma , even if over Burma floats the Union Jack . British capital should be welcome in all the American Republics , even if over them floats the Monroe Doctrine . In world development for human happiness let us operate not as nationals of this or that country but as human beings . Thomas Jefferson is reported to have said : " The less intercourse we have between governments , and the more between peoples , the better . " As usual , he used extreme language . As usual , he reached through it toward a great truth . Peace must spring from the state of mind of peoples . All the things that I propose in this article are by and for peoples . These proposals are economic steps toward world prosperity . Without them , I am convinced , no political steps can ever lead us to assured world peace . Peace can come only when peoples walk the ways of work and wealth together . The future is ours . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reluctantly , stumblingly , backs first . Or we can go into it chests first , with our eyes on the golden sunrise of a new day . I contend that the most intelligent and most manly and most profitable way is chests first and eyes forward .
