Cancer Fight Sir : <P> . . . TIME is worth its weight in diamonds for such articles as the cancer cover story ( TIME , June 27 ) . <P> <P> DWAYNE THORSON <P> New York City <P> Sir : <P> . . . Every American should read your article , it 's . . . very understandable . <P> MARVIN MORRISON <P> Kansas City , Mo . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Thank you for that perfectly wonderful article regarding the work that Dr. Rhoads is doing at Memorial Hospital . <P> I thought you might be interested to know that I was so touched by it that I have just sent my personal check to him to further the great work he and his associates are doing . <P> <P> H. F. GIBSON New York City <P> Sir : <P> Was it merely coincidence that the cover of Dr. Rhoads appeared when the sign of Cancer ( June 22-July 21 ) was in the ascendancy ? <P> <P> REBECCA A. HARMON San Francisco , Calif . Merely. - ED . <P> Unforgettable Afternoon <P> Sir : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of Bread Loaf School of English , special kudos on the timely article " The Intolerable Touch " <P> TIME , June 27 , which was a masterful commentary on a masterful poet . <P> For those of us who have attended Bread Loaf School about a mile up the road from Homer Noble Farm , the article and picture served as a sort of reunion with both that lovely mountain-girt country and the remarkable Robert Frost . . . My friends and fellow students of other years at Bread Loaf will long remember his puckish wit and astounding erudition on any subject . An afternoon talk with Frost in his tiny cabin set up the hillside from the Noble house , his shepherd dog Gillie lying by the fire and appearing to listen as his master talks of a variety of subjects including baseball , politics , education , 14th Century anonymous carols , farming , and the metaphysical Poets Donne and Marvell-this is an unforgettable experience . . . <P> <P> JOHN EDWARDS AKER New Orleans , La . <P> <P> Lost Loot <P> Sir : <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Schloss collection , which was seized by the Nazis and which in part is now being sold at auction in Paris . <P> Instead of sending their loot to the Alt Aussee mine , their great art repository , the <P> Nazis kept the 259 paintings in the Fhrer-bau of Munich for the sole reason of pleasing Hitler whenever he visited the city . When the end came , and the SS guards had fled . . . the people from the neighborhood , joined by D.P.s and liberated inmates of the Dachau camp , stormed the party buildings in search of scarce items . When all the food and liquor , and much of the furniture , had been carted off , they broke into the air-raid cellars where the paintings were stored , climbing over stacks of Panzerfaust grenades . . . <P> Of the 259 paintings , 96 were recovered . .. The Jan Steen ( Effects of Intemperance ) mentioned in your article . . . had been sold to a Munich businessman , a strange character who in two years had risen from nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon learning that Military Government was looking for the Jan Steen he hid it in a garage . There , behind a false wall , it was discovered . <P> Some of the still missing paintings are , I feel sure , tucked away in the slum dwellings around the Fhrerbau.
