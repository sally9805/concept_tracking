Among the hard-boiled mountaineers who came from Kentucky and West Virginia to work in the automobile plants , there was never any love for straw bosses . As a West Virginian called Short Laig remarked : " I aim tew get that baster who be my fore-main . " <P> Last week Short Laig got his wish . The independent Foreman 's Association of America , which had struck the Ford Motor Co. in the confident belief it could close it drum-tight , was getting the worst thrashing in its six-year career . And it was being given by Short Laig and his C.I.O. brethren . The C.I.O.-U.A.W. workers had walked right past the picket lines of the foremen , some of whom were elderly , prosperous-looking men in decorous blue serge suits . Even their signs had a decorous , plaintive ring : " What Has Happened to Human Relations ? " <P> A Day 's Work . For seven days A.F.L. teamsters had refused to drive truckloads of parts through the foremen 's lines . So the company brought them in by boxcar and the C.I.O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the teamsters to go through the lines . Student foremen and nonstriking supervisors worked 14 hours on the skeleton supervisory force . Some F.A.A. members of the 3,800 who had walked out went tack to work . Help also came from U.A.W. shop stewards . They knew that U.A.W. members could not afford to be laid off . And Ford had promised to keep running only if production remained high enough to be profitable . When one department fell behind , threatening a shutdown , a shop steward growled : " Look , you lazy bums , let 's do a day 's work for a change . " The department soon caught up . <P> " . . . Not Until . " With Ford auto assembly unhurt , pink-cheeked , balding Robert Keys , the ex-Ford foreman who had formed F.A.A. in 1941 and still heads it , telephoned Ford Personnel Chief John S. Bugas , and asked what Ford had to offer . Answered Bugas crisply : " I 'll be very happy to talk to you when the men go back to work-not until . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikers together to see what should be done . He confessed that he had been wrong-along with many industrialists-in his belief that a foreman 's strike could shut down a mass-production plant at once , but he hoped another week might turn the trick . The strikers had little hope of winning their demand for exclusive bargaining rights for supervisory employees not now F.A.A. members . Nevertheless , they voted to stay out for fear , as one said : " If we go back without a contract they 'll weed us out one at a time . " This week , in tougher mood , they blocked the cars of scab foremen until police cleared the gates . <P> Keys ' union , which had grown to over 35,000 members , found itself in a precarious spot . The labor bill now pending in Congress denies foremen the protection of the Wagner Act ( in effect repealing the Supreme Court decision of March 10 which put them under it ) . The only other club against management-a strike-had proved a slender reed . Furthermore , the union 's greatest source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract at
