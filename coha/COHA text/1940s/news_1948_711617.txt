txt Gov . Thomas E. Dewey charged tonight that his Democratic opponents had reached " a new low in mud-slinging " and , in a desperate effort to win another term in office , were spreading " fantastic fears among our people . " Coming into the Chicago Stadium just twenty-four hours after President Truman declared there that a Republican victory might lead to dictatorship in America , the Republican Presidential nominee revised his prepared Chicago text to reply to the Chief Executive . Police sources estimated 125,000 persons turned out to greet the candidate on his arrival here in mid-afternoon . The stadium , which holds 24,000 , offered standing room only as the Republican nominee made his final bid for Illinois ' twenty-eight electoral votes . There were thousands more outside .

It was instead " a campaign to strengthen and unite our country to meet the challenge of a troubled world , " he said .

The answer to President Truman came at the beginning of Governor Dewey 's speech , and the New Yorker then reverted to his announced theme of the interdependence of labor , agriculture and business and outlined some of the policies his administration would follow with regard to each . Chicago is one city where the Taft-Hartley Labor Act is a burning issue , with organized labor mobilizing as it never has before to defeat Republican members of the House of Representatives who enacted it . But Governor Dewey did not duck this issue in talking to his Chicago audience , to which , , - he was introduced by William F. , president of the Building Service Employes Union , AFL , and one of the few top labor men backing the Republican nominee .

" It wants to go back to the days when jurisdictional strikes could throw thousands out of work , and when Communist-controlled organizations could command the help of the Government of the United States . " Those reactionary propositions for which this present Administration is fighting are against the in-I terest of the American people and more particularly against the interests of American labor .

" He pledged a long-range price-support program to the farmers , and claimed for the Republicancontrolled Eightieth Congress the credit for enacting the AikenHope bill , which , he said , would be " a cornerstone of the agricultural policies of your next Administration . " Among the speakers preceding Mr. Dewey , Senator C. Wayland Brooks drew an ovation when he attacked President Truman 's remarks last night on the displaced persons bill . He said the President " borrowed from the demagoguery of poverty " when he called the bill anti-Catholic and antiSemitic . En route to Chicago the New York Governor had scheduled no rear-platform appearances , but when the train made an operating stop at Elkhart , Ind. , a few hundred persons gathered about his private car . He came out and talked briefly with them . Arriving in Chicago on his " Victory Special " at 4 P.
