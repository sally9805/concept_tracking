Since Sept. 3 , 1939 , little Britons in pubs and big Britons in clubs have debated whether the whole German people are to blame for Nazi Germany and World War II , or whether only evil , powerful men and their dupes are responsible . Last week , in a House of Lords debate , smooth , grim Lord Vansittart restated his familiar view that all Germans are accomplices and that , whatever happens to them as individuals , Germany should be destroyed " utterly and forever as a military power . " Winston Churchill 's grey advocate and Lord Chancellor , Viscount Simon , promptly made it clear that on this issue the British Government has other views . Said Viscount Simon : " I can only say now in plain terms on behalf of the Government that we agree with Premier Stalin-first , that the Hitlerite state can and should be destroyed , and second , that the whole German people is not , as Dr. Goebbels has been trying to persuade them , thereby doomed to destruction . " <P> Said the London News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the Government is making a rational and a constructive approach to the problem of Germany 's future . It shows too that upon at least one vital issue of the war our policy is in line with that of Russia . . . . "
