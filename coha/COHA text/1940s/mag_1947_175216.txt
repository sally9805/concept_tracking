Heart specialists in Atlantic City reported progress against heart disease , the No. 1 killer : <P> A Smooth Flow . Most dreaded and suddenly fatal of all heart ailments are those due to bloodclotting , e.g. , coronary thrombosis . For reasons not yet perfectly understood ( too little exercise , poor metabolism , infection ) , blood cells sometimes begin to stick together to form a thrombus ( a stationary clot ) . But the thrombus grows , may eventually let loose daughter clots ( emboli ) which swim on to lodge at vital bottlenecks in the blood stream . A thrombus which lodges in a coronary ( heart ) artery , blocking off the blood supply to the heart muscle , can kill within a few minutes ; a clot in the brain causes a stroke . <P> Against coronary thrombosis and embolism attacks , doctors used to be fairly helpless ; standard treatment was to dope the patient , give him oxygen to relieve the strain on the heart and a drug to relax the blood vessels . In most cases , patients survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the specialists reported last week , is no longer so dreaded . In the past two years investigators have had notable results with two anti-clotting drugs : heparin and dicumarol . Heparin is a substance in the liver and lungs first isolated in 1916 ; dicumarol is found in spoiled sweet clover ( its anti-clotting property was first discovered when it was found that cattle feeding on it sometimes bled to death ) . Both drugs prevent clots from forming . <P> Heparin acts within a few minutes , but it is expensive and has to be injected every few hours . Dicumarol is cheap and easy to take ( in pills ) , but it takes 24 hours to work . Doctors combine them : heparin for the emergency , dicumarol for longer-range effects . <P> Dr. Irving S. Wright of New York 's Post-Graduate Hospital reported that he had successfully treated more than 300 patients . Dr. Edgar V. Allen of the Mayo Clinic had used the two drugs in nearly 700 attacks of pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis . Under previous treatments , by normal expectancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one death . <P> A Pleasant Smoke . A sacred creed of most doctors-that smoking is bad for diseased hearts-was disputed by Dr. Robert L. Levy and a group of colleagues at Columbia 's College of Physicians and Surgeons . Dr. Levy 's group found that patients with various heart diseases who smoked two cigarets in succession showed no harmful effects . Smoking raised their blood pressure and heart rate , but no more than their usual daily emotional experiences . <P> Dr. Levy 's conclusion : moderate smoking is all right for many heart patients and helps promote " emotional stability " in smokers . But patients with such diseases as congestive heart failure , active rheumatic heart disease and acute heart damage , should let tobacco alone .
