At Lake Success last week , forlornly huddled at one end of a vast committee room , the Atomic Energy Commission held its first meeting since September . It set up a control committee to go ahead with the ' " majority plan " ( the U.S. plan ) , blueprinting the structure and operations of an international control body , even down to financing . Russia 's Andrei Gromyko , the deadpan diplomat , did not vote against this project , but he scorned it . Since Russia 's current line is to do nothing and to blame the U.S. for the fact that nothing is done , Gromyko did not want people to get the idea that the AEC was gaining ground . <P> Any impression that progress is being made , he said , would be " a wrong one . " He added : " I do not consider that it would be in the interest of the peoples of our nations to create such a wrong impression . " <P> While the AEC stood still , military staffs and armchair strategists toyed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atom . One current and quite plausible notion of how to keep the Red Army from seizing Europe : drop intensely poisonous atomic dust to form a barrier between the U.S.S.R. and the land to the west of it . Such a cordon might last for years ; it would not , however , prevent the Russians from developing bacteriological weapons , possibly more deadly than the atom ( see MEDICINE ) , which could be sent across the barrier . <P> The AEC is supposed to work out control of germ warfare , too . It will get around to that when &; if the Russians ever agree to atomic control .
