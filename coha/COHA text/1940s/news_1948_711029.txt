txt As Boston City Hall Departments ( tally their 1947 scores , it is evident that the Assessing De ; partment 's tax abatement cases will surpass previous years in number and amount . City records indicate that the city abated at least 85,000.000 in taxes , most of which were billed before 1947 , This figure is more than double the amount the city believed should be set aside for such contingencies . At the Assessing Department , Peter 3 , Allen , Commissioner , commented that " more cases have been settled than ever before . " He said that more than 5,000 cases had been adjusted up to Dec. 1 and the total for the year would probably exceed the 6,000 of 1946 . He explained that the Assessing Department was cleaning up accounts of long standing . including several ' very large ones . Based on its research activities . the Civic Department of the Boston Chamber of Commerce estimates that abatements in 1947 will be from $6,000,000 to $7. - 000,000 when finally totaled . In 1946 the same type . of deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining the 1947 abatement problem , the Civic Department noted that abatements in excess of what is anticipated must be raised in 1948 , either from taxes or available funds , " Until next . March or April . " it was noted . " it will net be possible to ascertain how much , if any , surplus revenue will be available to finance these deficits : It will depend upon such factors as excess of 1947 income over estimates , 1947 appropriation balances , the amount of taxes covered to tax titles . " It is reasonable to assume that some surplus revenue will be available , but it is not yet safe to assume that the city can make available for this purpose any larger amount than the $2.300.000 allowed in 1947 , Hence , a large amount ( $4,000.000 or more ) would find its way into the 1948. tax levy .
