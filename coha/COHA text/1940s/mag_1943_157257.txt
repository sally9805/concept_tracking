The Supreme Court upset this week the conviction of George Sylvester Viereck , self-assured German propagandist whom a Federal District Court jury last March found guilty of failing to tell the State Department all about his doings . <P> Grounds for the Supreme Court 's action were technical : under amendments to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 , the Government had tried ex post facto to bring the German-born American to account for political activities . Viereck , author and journalist , was sentenced to prison for two to six years , fined $1,500 and costs . Now his case is remanded to the lower court ; he is under indictment on charges of sedition and conspiracy to undermine the morale of the armed forces . <P> Chief Justice Stone , who wrote this week 's five-to-two* decision , sharply scolded the prosecuting attorney for his conduct during Viereck 's trial . Said Stone : " In his closing remarks to the jury he ( William Power Maloney , Special Assistant to the Attorney General ) indulged in an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could only have been to arouse passion and prejudice . The United States Attorney . . . is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law , the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer . . . . But while he may strike hard blows , he is not at liberty to strike foul ones . . . . " <P> *Dissenting : Justices Black and Douglas ; not participating : Justices Jackson Rutledge.
