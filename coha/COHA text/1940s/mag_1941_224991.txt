Strange and viciously unseasonable was U.S. weather last week . Snow came , heat came , drought came , wind came-in all sizes : little capfuls that scuttered leaves along a million autumn sidewalks , breezes that sailed or deadened thousands of punted footballs ; squalls , gales , tempests ; a hurricane , a tornado . <P> Snow . Along the Rockies , from Montana through Idaho into Utah , whirled the season 's first far-spread snowstorm . Neither a blizzard nor the light , quick-melting flakes of the first autumn snow , it was a heavy , impartial snowfall over many &; many a mile of still-green valley land . <P> Hurricane . Howling out of a dull sky , a hurricane jumped from Nassau to the skirts of Miami , curved out into the Gulf of Mexico , wheeled and ripped back across Georgia and South Carolina out to sea again . In its wake were eleven dead , 20 missing . <P> The storm had begun by pounding over Watling Island in the Bahamas-probably the San Salvador which was Christopher Columbus ' first landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen were drowned when the deep boiled like a pot . Near Moultrie , Ga . a schoolgirl was killed when she stepped on a storm-whipped live wire . At Dinner Key the wind blew 123 miles per hour at the Pan-American Airways base . Houses crumpled , boats swamped , streets flooded . Part of the metal dome of the State Capitol at Tallahassee was torn off . <P> Flood . The biggest flood in the memory of eastern Arizona 's old settlers poured down the Gila ( pronounced hee-la ) River . Ignoring midnight flood warnings , 100 families of the farm village of Duncan ( pop . 887 ) saw their adobe houses crumble in the swirling brown waters next afternoon . <P> Tornado . Out of a darkened sky in Kansas swept a savage downpour of rain . In eastern Kansas City the rain suddenly became a sky-high funnel , black-dirty , twisting , swerving , diving , hopping with aimless , deadly ferocity . By the time men yelled " Tornado ! " the wind was past . Three people were killed , at least 135 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a newly built church converted into rubble , trees , streets , power lines ripped and broken . Men &; women who knew the dreaded roaring noise threw their children to the floor , themselves on top of the children , as their roofs were blown away . Some houses were wrecked into splinters . One house was blown 700 feet . Mrs. Dorothy Lucas and her 18-month-old baby , Diana , were ripped out of their frame house , blown 500 feet to death , their bodies stripped of clothing . Doorjamb of the Lucas house , still bearing the small metal numerals of the address , was torn from the rest of the wreckage , jammed upright in the ground near Mrs. Lucas , like a grave marker . <P> Witnesses tried to describe the peculiar sound of the tornado . Said one : " ... A loud slapping noise , as if a truck was running down the street with all four tires flat . " Like " the rumble of a train , " said Joe Parker , 12 .
