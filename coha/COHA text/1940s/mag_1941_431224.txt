 | DARK had fallen with the sudden intense blackout of a starless tropical night . The candle reached feebly into the darkness with wavering fingers of yellow light , revealing a disordered array of shiny , grinning skulls . The silence was complete save for a single sound , coming at us from all directions at once ? a shrill , persistent hum which seemed to penetrate our very eardrums . The dim light of the candle flickered in the humid breeze , and the hollow eye orbits of the skulls seemed to wink above the filed white teeth . A hand reached out . Slowly and with extreme care it cradled the nearest skull and lifted it up . A pair of eyes gazed intently , and suddenly the silence was broken by a voice . " Dolichocephalic , I 'd say , but this deformation makes it hard to tell . " Phil held the skull away from him in a Hamletlike pose and studied it some more .

" Our regular evening session in the screened house at our Cerro de las Mesas camp on the Rio Blanco in southern Veracruz , Mexico , was drawing to a close . We had completed a somewhat more productive day than usual on the archeological dig and had to sit up late , cleaning and varnishing the day 's haul of fragile skeletal material . Phil Drucker , Mrs. Stirling , and I were aided by Miguel and Pedro , our Mexican assistants of three years ' standing , on the National Geographic Society ? Smithsonian Institution Archeological Expedition to Veracruz . We had been wielding our probes and brushes for three hours and were relieved to see the last bones laid down .

One of our temperamental gasoline lanterns had failed us again , and he found a new job awaiting him as soon as he had hung up his last negative to dry . When at last the lanterns were in working order and the Duco , acetone , and brushes put away , it was almost midnight and we each had still a 15-minute task of thoroughly searching ourselves for ticks before we could go to bed . In thus starting with the end of the day instead of the beginning , I hope I may disillusion those who picture archeological field work as a large-scale picnic outing . After supervising the laboring crew all day , the work of the field staff is but half over , as the evenings must be spent in cataloguing , writing up notes , cleaning , repairing , and packing specimens .

Skeletal Clues to Lost History Human skeletal material is one of the most important media with which the archeologist works . In reconstructing the history and ethnology of an archeological site , it is highly important to know the physical type of the occupants themselves . If new people moved into a site , the change in physical make-up may reveal this fact , and these types may then be related to known types in other areas , hinting at the direction from which the people came . The pathology of bones sometimes reveals diseases with which they were afflicted . Cultural traits , too , may appear with skeletal material . At Cerro de las Mesas , for example , we found that the custom of artificially deforming the head in infancy by applying pre --  sure pads to the skull was practiced by the later occupants of the site , but not by their predecessors ( Plate III ) . These later Indians also had the custom ornamentally filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inlaid with semiprecious stones . These practices were not followed by the first inhabitants . In the lowlands of the American Tropics bones rarely are sufficiently well-preserved be of use . At Tres Zapotes scarcely a skeletal material remained .  | At Cerro de las Mesas , on the other hand , where the climate is less humid and soil conditions more favorable , we recovered a considerable quantity of skeletal material . The proper care and preservation of it , however , was a tedious and time-consuming task . During the winter of 1939-40 , our second season at Tres Zapotes , we had made a brief reconnaissance trip to the Rio Blanco and had selected the site of Cerro de las Mesas for investigation during the season of 1940-41 . The Rio Blanco , with its sources in the snows of Citlaltepetl ( Orizaba ) , flows in an easterly direction into the Bay of Alvarado ( map , page 283 ) . In its upper courses it is a swift mountain stream plunging through deep gorges until it enters the comparatively level coastal plain . The fertile alluvial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest times the Mixtequilla , suggesting a former Mixtec occupation of the region . In pre-Columbian times a large population existed here , as shown by the almost continuous succession of big mound groups ex- tending from Piedras Negras to beyond Ignacio de la Llave . The Cerro de las Mesas group , almost in the center of the area , is the largest and most imposing of all . Excepting for a single large and crudely carved stela at Cerro de Gallo , two miles distant , Cerro de las Mesas has the only stone monuments in the region and was probably the ceremonial center for the entire Mixtequilla . The central feature of the site consists of a rectangular plaza , bordered on the north by two huge pyramidal earth mounds and on the south by two somewhat smaller mounds . Between the latter is a fifth mound . The principal monument plaza lies between this mound and the one forming the southwest corner of the main plaza . Here we made our most interesting discoveries ( page 284 ) . At Tres Zapotes we were comparatively isolated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since a very bad road runs to Cerro de las Mesas , we luxuriated this year in a station  | wagon .

Blessings of the Drought As in previous years , I ) r . Drucker had been sent in advance to start construction of t h e camp . A site was selected in a beautiful tropical setting , in the midst of the principal mound group , and on the edge of what had been a small lake the year before when we had visited the site i Plate VI ) . This year for the first time in the memory of the oldest inhabitant the lake was dry . The crocodiles had migrated to the river and , we hoped , most of the mosquitoes as well . The unusual drought proved a blessing to us in other ways , but principally because it enabled us to sink our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have permitted ( page 318 ) . When Stewart , Mrs. Stirling , and I arrived , the camp was half-finished , and we spent a busy week in the midst of palm thatch , gravel for our cement floors , and hordes of spectators from the near-by village of Paso del Vote . Our first archeological work was at the near-by monument plaza . Before we could excavate the stones , we had to clear away the dense second-growth jungle which covered most of the area containing the stones . A crew of ten men with machetes and hooked sticks accomplished this formidable job in two days , and we were ready to begin the heavy but interesting task of upending the fallen stelae and half-buried monuments ( page 285 ) . At TresZapotes the monuments were scattered over a wide area ; at Cerro de las Mesas the majority were confined to a space not more than 50 yards square . In all , we found here 15 stelae and eight other monuments . This season we deciphered a second early Initial Series date at the site and discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statuette and other interesting monuments . Stylistically , the stones appear to fall into three groups separated by a considerable time period . In excavating beneath the stones we discovered a rectangular enclosure which had evidently at one time contained several of the  | monuments . This consisted of a thick earth wall covered with white stucco , which still retained traces of the red , green , and black paint with which it had once been decorated . Subsequently , we observed that a stairway led from this enclosure to the summit of the mound which lay just to the east of it . Mystery of the Whistling Fat Man In excavating the interior of this enclosure we encountered numerous intrusive burials of children , usually accompanied by jade beads . Beneath one of the monuments we found a plumbate whistling jar in the form of a fat man seated , holding a spouted vessel on his lap . This ware , finished with a lead glaze which gives it a metallic luster , occurs most frequently in El Salvador and Guatemala . This particular example , made with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spout , is probably unique in Mexico , although this device was fairly common in ancient Peru and one example has been reported from Honduras . Near the northeast corner of the main plaza and close to the large mound bordering it was a relatively small flat-topped mound , selected for our first mound excavation . This excavation , Trench 30 , turned out to be , except for Trench 34 , the richest of the season . A cross-section trench 15 feet wide and 36 feet long demonstrated that the entire structure was only 81 feet high . It consisted of  | a low primary mound two and a half feet high , covered with a floor of baked clay . Over this subsequently had been erected another mound which added six feet to the original height . In excavating through this upper mound , numerous burials were encountered , many of which had with them rich offerings of jade and fine pottery . Five pottery vessels were buried separately , each of which contained the neatly sawed-off face of a human skull . On reaching the lower or primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain the remains of a single individual , a personage of prominence in the community . The body had been tightly flexed and laid on its side in the exact center of the mound . It had been decapitated and the skull placed face down in a large orange-colored marine shell filled with red paint . The exceptionally wide jaw had been detached and placed alongside the skull . The skull was large and thin , with extreme fronto-occipital flattening , giving it , to our eyes , a grotesque appearance , but one undoubtedly admired as most aristocratic by its possessor 's contemporaries . To complete the picture of aboriginal beauty ,  | the incisors and canine teeth were carefully and neatly inlaid with circular pieces of pyrite . Around the skull and shell was a string of 56 massive shell beads an inch in diameter , still lustrous . In each was utilized the natural color of the shell from which it was made , so that half of each bead was colored a rich orange hue and the other half a creamy white . In the shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large pearl , two jade beads , and a cleverly carved monkey head of jade . The skull was flanked by a pair of beautifully polished and matched jade tubes , each about six inches long . Resting against the back of the skull were two large disk-shaped shell ornaments with scalloped edges , perforated for suspension . They were made from the same kind of shell as that containing the skull , as were also the large shell beads . " Refined as a Dentist 's Inlay " One of these disks had several holes in it , made by marine borers . These holes had been neatly filled with carefully fitted shell plugs of the same color and material . The workmanship was as refined as a modern dentist 's inlay . Also behind the skull was a turtle shell covered with an elaborately engraved design representing a plumed serpent . The design had been emphasized by rubbing red paint into the incisions . This shell is one of the finest art objects which we have discovered during three seasons of work in Mexico . Inside the turtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which still retained their luster and beautiful mahoganybrown color patterns . By the knees of the burial was a deposit of eleven handsome pottery vessels , all inverted . Some of these were tall , graceful vessels of polished black ware decorated with tasteful incised designs ; others were jars coated with white stucco and painted with designs in rose , green , red , blue , yellow , and black . A foot to the north of the , skull had been placed a highly polished stone yoke , one of those mysterious stones found rather frequently in the State of Veracruz and much more rarely in other parts of Mexico and Central America . These yokes are among the finest examples of the stone carver 's art from aboriginal America . Beside the stone yoke and facing the burial was a beautiful seated female figurine of polished red and buff ware , holding on its lap a small red-painted human figure of archaic type . @#  | The workmen had been joking about our seeking the tomb of El Rey , and when this burial was discovered they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we had been in camp about three weeks , we had the pleasure of a visit for several days from Miguel Covarrubias and his charming wife Rose , an artist in her own right ( Plate I and page 323 ) . Covarrubias would be known as one of the best-informed men on Mexican archeology and ethnology were it not for his fame as a painter , caricaturist. and writer . He spent a busy time drawing the designs on the stone monuments . His detailed knowledge of aboriginal Mexican art fitted him for his task , and his enthusiasm reinfected all of us . While in camp , he spoke of a site with stone monuments , well known locally but only casually visited , in the This Fine vicinity of Tapachula , State of Chiapas . This site , located on the " Lands of Izapa " near the Guatemalan border , had been inspected a few years ago by Karl Ruppert and Dr. A. V. Kidder . Covarrubias said that photographs he had seen reminded him somewhat of the stone sculpture at La Venta . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . Permission from the Mexican authorities to clear and photograph the monuments was readily granted . Stewart , Mrs. Stirling , and I took the train at Piedras Negras for the long trip , requiring two days and a night , to the extreme southwestern corner of Mexico . We spent a week at Izapa , which turned out to be an interesting and imposing site with numerous large mounds and curiously carved stelae with altars . The heat was intense while we worked during the most strenuous week we spent in the field . However , we located more than 30 stelae and altars and felt well repaid for our efforts ( pages 280 , 327 ) . Tehuantepec , a Woman 's Country Returning , we stopped over in Tehuantepec and Juchitan on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . Again following a suggestion from Covarrubias , we located in the village of San Blas , a suburb of Tehuantepec , the last Indian pottery maker of the region who retained the art of modeling pottery figurines . Here we spent three days in photographing the stages of this survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XIII ) . Tehuantepec is indeed a woman 's country . Men are not allowed to compete with the women in the markets , and one is scarcely aware that the Indian men exist . The handsome women , with their erect carriage and colorful costumes , are everywhere ( Pl . XII ) . The town of Juchitan , less famous , is just . is vivid as Tehuantepec . Here are manufacured colorful braided palm-leaf hats and mats ( Plate XVI ) . The owners of the principal establishment courteously allowed us to watch all of the manufacturing processes . Leaving Juchitan , we again took the train across the Isthmus . Approaching Piedras Negras , we viewed with misgivings the evidence of the recent norther in the mud and pools of water along the roadbed . We wondered if Phil would meet us . As we pulled in we saw the station wagon , plastered with mud from top to bottom , with Phil and Pedro standing by . They had spent five hours making the trip which usually took us one and a half , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride back to camp was wild and rough . Our return had been anticipated as an event of social significance . The girls and Miguel , who had been left in charge , announced that a huapango , the sprightly dance popular throughout Veracruz , had been arranged for the next day ( Plates IV and XV ) . The Finding of the Skulls Three and a half months had elapsed and the time of the expedition was drawing to a close . In our absence Phil had continued excavation of the trench back of the monument plaza , and also had begun excavations in a mound near the northern edge of the site . Deep in the latter was a burial accompanied by a lacquer bowl . The gourd comprising the bowl had disappeared , but the lacquer design was intact . By patient and careful work it was exposed and photographed . An apron on this mound was then selected as a site for excavation . Three feet beneath the surface a cement floor was encountered . A foot below this was a second cement floor , and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors , placed in double rows , were 52 pottery vessels of hard red ware , almost identical in size and appearance . Each contained the skull of a young adult with two or three vertebrae attached , indicating that  | the heads had been severed and placed in the vessels . The skulls had been artificially flattened and in many of them the front teeth were ornamentally filed with notches , giving them a serrated appearance . Here was a fine archeological mystery . The way the burial urns were placed showed that all had been interred at one time . The pots had been placed upon one cement floor , covered with shallow inverted dishes , and then the entire floor covered with earth to a depth sufficient to cover the pots . They were sealed by another cement floor laid immediately above them ( Plate III and page 288 ) . The fact that the vertebrae were attached and the jaws in place indicated the probability that all of the heads were collected at one time . Possibly these heads represented a mass human sacrifice performed upon some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians of Middle America had developed a system of pictorial writing . Artists made books , drawn in color on parchment or paper made from maguey fiber . These books contained their histories ? records of war , migrations , and other events . Another group recorded astronomical calculations used for prophesying coming events and for determining lucky dates for undertaking various enterprises . First Pre-Columbian Book Excavated Because they were intimately connected with the religious life of the natives , zealot Spaniards destroyed all of these books found in the possession of the natives . Thus was lost a record of incalculable value of the civilization of the New World . Nevertheless , a few of these books survived and from time to time have been discovered in archives of Europe  | and of Mexico . None had ever been found during archeological excavation . In Trench 34 we found the remains of one of these books , but the ravages of time made it possible to see only small portions of it . The book had apparently consisted of twelve or more pages . The material comprising the sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been covered and the painted designs remained bright and fresh . The colors were red , green , blue , and purple . The different layers of sizing with their colored pictures were virtually welded one against the other . To separate them would be an exceedingly delicate if not impossible task . Finding this document in place with the types of pottery and other artifacts belonging to the same period makes it a discovery of much archeological interest . To a certain extent archeologists are able to regulate their success in digging by a knowledge of the habits and customs of the ancient peoples whose remains they are seeking . However , Lady Luck is also a factor , and no archeologist is ever convinced that he did not miss the most important specimens by an inch or two , or stop his dig just a foot before the big discovery which never came to light . A good illustration of the way such things can happen was afforded us at Trench 34 , the big cross section cut through the mound facing the monument plaza . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been enlarged from time to time and that a stairway had formerly led from the monument plaza to its summit ( opposite page ) . Numerous cylindrical vessels were each half filled with sea shells , coral , marine fossils ? and always a jade bead . We discovered that a deep trench had formerly existed at the rear of the floor on top of the mound , and this was filled with human bones , piled in without order , as if they had been dumped over the rear edge of the mound from the temple floor . Clearing the earth from the upper part of the buried cement-covered stairway , we found  | a pile of hollow arms and legs of pottery figurines . In this odd assortment was a clay figurine of a woman holding a dog under her arm . Directly under the heap was a circular enclosure two and a half feet in diameter , composed of upended arms and legs of a life-size clay figure . In the middle of this circle was a large pedestal in the form of a short truncated cone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and painted red . Under the pedestal and partly inside it was the life-size headless torso of a pregnant female . Around the waist was a bright-red belt with a bow in front . In cleaning the earth from its hollow interior , the bones of an infant were found in the abdomen . Lady Luck , and a Satanic Face The principal surprise , however , was vet in store for us . In clearing away the earth from below this figure we uncovered as emerging in birth a magnificent life-size head of a bearded figure wearing red-painted ear plugs . This head , with its curiously striking Satanic leer , reminds one strongly of the similar bearded figure discovered last season near Tres Zapotes ( Plate II ) . Alongside the large pedestal was a smaller rectangular inverted pedestal . When lifted , this was found to have under it a fine clay mask in the form of an anthropomorphic jaguar face , with a lolling tongue having four spikes projecting from it . As the wide trench grew deeper , it became necessary to remove the dirt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of the trench , up which the dirt could be wheeled . The season was almost finished , and most of the crew were occupied in filling and leveling the excavations . We decided to save this excavation , which was our largest , until last , as it was adjacent to our camp and we wished to get as deep as possible through the earth structures in the middle of the mound , which was now exposed to a depth of 18 feet . In one more day the remaining excavations would be filled . I determined to continue digging in the big trench during this day and then to put the entire crew to the task of filling it . Miguel was in charge of the digging crew while the rest of us were packing . About the middle of the morning he sent one of the men to bring me to the excavation . On arriving I saw that Miguel , for some reason best known to himself , had ordered the workmen to remove the wheelbarrow ramp in the lower north corner of the trench . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement and some heavy fragments of an incense vessel . Sensing that this deposit might be an interesting feature . Miguel had taken over with his trowel and cleared the earth from the top of the pile . Jade , Jade , and More Jade ! On one side a red-painted stone proved to be a large and well-carved anthropomorphic monkey , while on the other side was a similar but smaller red-painted stone in the form of a turtle . Carefully working around the edge of the potsherd deposit , the earth fell away from a thin circular piece of polished jade . In attempting to clear this , the trowel encountered another , then another , and it could be seen that they were large ear ornaments . At this point Miguel had sent for me . It was evident at a glance that this was discovery of exceptional importance . Apparently the large potsherds , the chunk of cement , and the stone figures formed a protective cover for a huge pile of jade . Carefully we worked around the deposit until we had revealed its complete extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornaments , beads , and jade tubes which comprised the top of the pile we could get tantalizing glimpses of the corners of carved plaques , curious pointed implements , and sections of human figures . Apparently the best material had been placed first in the deposit , and then these were covered with the beads and ear ornaments . Working slowly , it required the rest of the morning to clear the earth completely from around the pile . With three of us working continuously , it required a half hour to take out all of the jade ? 782 specimens in all ! ( Plates VII , VIII . ) Why was this cache ? a treasure of inestimable value in the eyes of the Indians ? placed where we found it ? One thing is apparent : it did not accompany a burial and therefore in all probability it constituted tribal property rather than the possessions of an individual . It might have been an offering at the dedication of a temple or an enlargement of the mound . The fact that it was placed in the mound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the entire site , would lend weight to this theory . On the other hand , it is possible that on the approach of a conquering people , possibly the Aztecs themselves , the treasure was buried to conceal it . If so , the secret was well kept . The variety of material and art styles represented gives special scientific interest to the find . The jade comprising the individual pieces apparently came from widely scattered  | sources . The workmanship , too , appears to represent different sections of the country . One interesting piece is a gorget which had been reworked from an older specimen . When its polished back is held so that a crosslight falls upon it , the delicately etched profile of an elaborately costumed Maya priest is revealed , underlying the present design . In addition to sectional differences in style , a considerable time period seems to be covered , as both early and late styles here occur together . Apparently many specimens had been treasured for centuries as objects of art . Notable among the older examples are three magnificent pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . One of these is the replica of a canoe with two typical Olmec faces engraved on the flat projecting stem and stern ; another is a curious pendant carved in the form of a macaw . This has two lateral perforations and was probably the central piece for a double necklace of beads . The third is a realistically carved infantile figure , which in workmanship and quality of material is not only the finest piece in the collection , but is undoubtedly one of the finest jades ever found in Mexico . Whence Came the jade ? The source of the jade used in ancient Mexico has always been a mystery . No mines are known where the material exists in situ . Apparently it was found in the form of pebbles or boulders in stream beds . These pieces were then patiently worked into beads and art objects by special craftsmen . The ancient Mexicans did not classify the different types of stones related to jade according to the chemical constituents , as do modern mineralogists , but all were grouped under the term chaichihuitt . Undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones . At Cerro de las Mesas the color of the stones ranged from porcelain white through shades of green to deep blue . Two cache specimens were of translucent green alabaster . The type of jade usually found in the earliest localities is of a rather gray-green color , but capable of taking a high polish . Emeraldgreen jade probably originating in the mountains of Oaxaca was apparently not used until a few centuries before the Spanish Conquest . In the early accounts of the conquest are many episodes which indicate the high value which the Indians set upon jade . When Cortes landed near Veracruz in 1519 , the native governor sent word of his arrival to Montezuma . The ambassadors of Montezuma later returned bringing a great treasMasterpieces of Carved Jade 301 ure of gold and other native objects of art . After elaborate preliminary formalities , the gift was spread out before Cortes and his officers on a mat . The objects comprising the treasure are impressively described by Bernal Diaz del Castillo : " The first was a round plate , about the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest gold , and of the most beautiful workmanship ; a most extraordinary work of art , which , according to the account of those who weighed it , was worth about 20,000 gold pesos . " The second was a round plate , even larger than the former , of massive silver , representing the moon , with rays and other figures on it , being of great value . " The third was a helmet , completely filled with pure grains of gold , as they are found in the mines , worth about 3,000 pesos , which was more to us than if it had been ten times the value , as we now knew for certain there were rich gold mines in the country . " Among other things , there were also thirty golden ducks , exactly resembling the living bird , and of splendid workmanship ; further , figures resembling lions , tigers , dogs , and apes ; likewise ten chains with lockets , all of gold , and of the most costly workmanship ; a bow with the string and twelve arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those used by the justices , all cast of the purest gold ; further , they brought small cases containing the most beautiful green feathers , blended with gold and silver , and fans similarly worked ; every species of game likewise cast in gold . " There were alone above 30 packages of cotton stuffs , variously manufactured and interworked with variegated feathers . He wished very much to see our great emperor , who was such a powerful monarch , of whom , although residing at such a vast distance , he had already gained some knowledge , and he would send him a present of some valuable stones ( jade ) . " Cortes sent the messengers back with another present for Montezuma , and they in a few days returned with another royal gift , " consisting in ten packages of mantles , richly worked in feathers ; further , four chalchihuitls , a species of green stone of uncommon value , which are held in higher estimation with them than the emerald with us ; lastly , there were also all kinds of gold trinkets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four chalchihuitls , they observed that those were intended as a present to our emperor , as each of them was worth more than a load of gold . " After Cortes reached Mexico City and Montezuma was being held as an honorable prisoner of war , Cortes had required him to  | order collected from all of the provinces under Mexican control a treasure of gold for the Emperor of Spain . Montezuma complied with this order and turned over to Cortes a golden loot valued at more than 600,000 gold pesos . " Worth Two Loads of Gold " Upon giving it to Cortes , the Aztec emperor said : " When you transmit this treasure to your emperor , you must say in your letter , this is sent you by your faithful vassal Montezuma . To this I will also add a few jades , of such enormous value that I would not consent to give them to any one save to such a powerful emperor as yours : each of these stones is worth two loads of gold . " Later , when the legions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tremendous loss of life from the capital city of the Aztecs , the gold-hungry Spaniards , in spite of their peril , attempted to carry away with them as much of the gold as possible . Bernal Diaz , who participated in the famous retreat of the Noche Tr ste , attributes the saving of his life to the fact that , instead of burdening himself with gold , he brought with him only four jade beads , which treasure later enabled him to be cured of his wounds and to obtain everything he needed because of its negotiability among the Indians . The conquistadores succeeded pretty well during the 16th century in cleaning up all of the visible wealth of the Indians . Many are the legends of treasure hidden to conceal it from the Spaniards ' eager search . In past years occasional finds of aboriginal wealth have been made , but they are not common . There have been the unsupervised discoveries of gold hoards in Ecuador , Colombia , and Peru , and the scientifically excavated treasures of Cocle in Panama . Most interesting of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomb 7 at Monte Alban , near Oaxaca City , Mexico . The jade cache of Cerro de las Mesas must have represented a tribal ransom to those who buried it . The reason why it was concealed will probably never be certainly known . Esthetically and scientifically , it has added materially to our knowledge of aboriginal Mexico . In any event , it represents the largest find yet made of the most precious substance known to the ancient civilizations of Mexico .
