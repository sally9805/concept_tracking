The night was drizzly and starless , but in the last hours of June the forecast was for clearing weather . By July 's first dawn , the blacktopped , coral runway of Kwajalein islet was ablaze with lights . It was Able-day for Operation Crossroads and the explosion of the world 's fourth atomic bomb . <P> Overhead was the roar of planes . But all eyes , mostly red from lack of sleep , were focused on a glistening B-29 Super-fort , Dave 's Dream , * which stood apart at the south side of the strip . <P> Alongside the plane was a tent in which Manhattan District engineers had assembled " The Thing . " A mobile crane had hoisted it from the tent to a trench beneath the plane 's open bomb bay . Hidden by canvas from all but a superselect few , The Thing was drawn up into the bay . All that could be told about it was that it was big enough to have a foot-high picture of Cinemactress Rita Hayworth pasted on its side . The Thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The bomb bay was closed . In the purpling east , cumulus clouds bumped heads in a huddle . As Major Woodrow P. Swancutt pushed the throttles all the way forward , a rainbow shone overhead . Dave 's Dream gathered speed , then rose slowly into the easterly wind . It was 5:54 a.m . <P> To the north , 240 air miles away , was Bikini , once one of the least-known and most peaceful of Pacific island groups . In Bikini 's 200-sq. - mi. lagoon was an anchorage about five miles in diameter . In a space where the Navy would normally have only 14 ships ( or five in a cruising formation at sea ) , 73 vessels had been jampacked for the test . <P> The air above was cut by fourscore planes , many of them pilotless , radio-controlled drones flown from Eniwetok or the carriers Shangri-La and Saidor . Worker planes kept these in their appointed rounds . <P> Then to the rendezvous came the queen bee . Dave 's Dream 's weaponeers , two 26-year-old ensigns , David L. Anderson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes after takeoff . Soaring at 30,000 feet above the polka-dotted lagoon , Dave 's Dream made a dry run into the northeast wind . Bombardier Major Harold H. Wood-known to his crewmates as " Lemon Bar " because of his success at officers ' - club slot machines-twirled the knobs on his bombsight , tried to line up the target ship Nevada with the cross hairs of his eyepiece . Topside , the Nevada had been painted a livid orange , striped with white . She wore her campaign ribbons painted on big boards-among them the Purple Heart with two stars ( one hit at Pearl Harbor , two at Okinawa ) . <P> Duck Talk . The word was passed , " Thirty minutes to go . " Around the world ordinary men &; women , who would be the casualties in an atomic war , bent their heads and cupped their ears to radio sets to catch this preview . <P> Operation Crossroads had been ballyhooed as the greatest laboratory experiment in all history . To the listening world , it sounded like an animal circus at feeding time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen Donald Ducks quacked endlessly and often pointlessly . <P> Through it all , announcers asked listeners to concentrate on the tick of a metronome placed before an open microphone on the abandoned Pennsylvania . When the ticking stopped , it would be because the bomb had gone off , and the microphone with it .
