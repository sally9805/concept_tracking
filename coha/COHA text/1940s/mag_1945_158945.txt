The good , grey New York Times , which prides itself on printing the news ( if it 's fit and proper ) at full length , last week did it again. * It published the entire 130,000 words of the Army &; Navy 's Pearl Harbor reports . It was quite a job . The Times flew the texts up from Washington , piled up 80 hours of printers ' overtime in setting it , tossed out four pages of advertising , dipped into its paper rations to boost its average midweek 155 columns of news to 283 columns , and hit the streets with the full text seven and a half hours after getting it . <P> <P> * The Times printed the 55-column full text of the Versailles Treaty , Einstein 's own ( and almost universally incomprehensible ) explanation of his Field Theories , old and new , in four columns .
