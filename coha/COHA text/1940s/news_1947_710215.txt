txt Financing Small Business To THENDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have read with interest . Ernest G. Draper 's letter in your issue of Feb. 18 and your editorial of Jan. 31 . I have read Congressional reports and Congressional hearings . I have listened to the radio , to debates and to lectures . But none ' has answered the question of what is small business . Nor do any distinguish between working ' capital and equity capital in small business . I am a small-business man . I am in commerce and not in manufacturing . I have no need for equity capital for permanent " fixtures , " such as buildings and machinery . My funds are in goods in movement . Turnover is rapid . I need loans to finance the turnover . Theoretically , banks should be hungry for my business . Practically , banks want none of this business . My experience has been that banks are primarily interested in the equity inyestment of a firm and they loan Una* funds on this basis . The expression " commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reasons for the establishment of the Federal Reserve System was to develop a market for selft liquidating commercial paper . Tha system has failed in this duty and the chief sufferer has been the small-bustness man and small business , whatever that is . HYMEN I. MALATZKY . ; New York , Feb. 21 , 1947.
