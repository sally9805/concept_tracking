txt CITY WORKERS SEEK $50,000,000 IN RISES Report Favoring an Increase for Transit Men to Bring Rush of Union Demands By PAUL CROWELL Publication of the recommendations of Mayor O'Dwyer 's transit advisory committee , favoring substantial pay rises , improved working conditions and stabilized labor relations for the 32,000 employes of the city 's unified transit system , will be the signal for a flood of demands for similar concessions to other city employes , it was indicated yesterday . Labor organizations representing many thousands of city employes outside the Board of Transportation are preparing demands for substantial pay rises , on the strength of the strong upward trend of living costs since the 1946-47 budget was adopted in June . An informal estimate placed the total increase to be demanded at a minimum of $50,000,000 . One estimate set the figure close to $100,000,000 . These totals were exclusive of the $15,000,000 to $20 , - 000,000 of wage rises that the Mayor 's committee is expected to recommend for the transit workers . Advances to be Retroactive Arthur S. Meyer , chairman of the Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall by the end of the month , perhaps this week . Although not bound to accept the recommendations , the Board of Transportation is expected to go along with the findings , while making clear its position that the city must look outside the revenues of the unified lines for funds to meet the increased payroll . Charles P. Gross , chairman of the board , has indicated that any pay rises approved by that body will be retroactive to July 1 , " so far as practicable . " The American Federation of Labor , the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the Civil Service Forum are among the labor organizations that will press demands for higher wages for city employes other than those of the Board of Transportation . The CIO unions are planning the most aggressive campaign and will link it with a strong recruiting drive in which the success of the Transport Workers Union in forcing the city to recognize the demand for more // money for transit workers will be fully exploited . The demands of the unions for pay rises for city workers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the present . Several unions will seek immediate rises , over and above those already incorporated in the 1946-47 budget . A move in this direction has already been made by the AFL unit in the Department of Sanitation , which has asked the Mayor for a 35 per cent increase . The CIO unit in the same department is pressing the Mayor to order Commissioner William J. Powell to enter into negotiations for pay rises , shorter hours and better working conditions . The intention of the labor groups to press for substantial wage increases , with the- recommendations of the Meyer committee as a springboard , has been called to the Mayor 's attention . During informal talks with union representatives and personal advisers in close touch with union plans , the Mayor has indicated his personal sympathy with their demands , his appreciation of the rising cost of living and his belief that city workers , even with the increases granted in the 1946-47 budget , are receiving inadequate pay in general . He has made it clear , however , that he must give full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgetary limitations . The limitations imposed by the City Charter and ' 1 e State laws affecting municipal finance , the union representatives have been advised , make it all but impossible for the city to grant any substantial rises before the next fiscal year . Even now the Mayor 's financial aides are wrestling with the problem of financing the rise that the Meyer committee will recommend for the transit workers . Since the revenues from the unified transit lines will exceed operating costs only slightly , virtually every dollar of the increase must be met from some other source . There is some doubt whether the city can do anything but resort to budget and tax notes to raise the necessary funds . The City Charter and the State laws on municipal finance , it was reported , do not provide enough leeway to raise the amount needed . There is a possibility that the Legislature may be asked early next year to provide additional machinery to enable the city to carry the load .               @ @ @ @ @ @
