In a deadly green valley on Guam , a Marine in mottled battle dress worked slowly forward , Garand at the ready . Ahead of him crept another mottled figure : a brown and black Doberman pinscher with ears acock . Now and again the dog stopped ; the Marine hand-signaled to it and the dog moved on . Then suddenly the Doberman stiffened . The Marine raised his rifle and the valley echoed with shots . From a tree ahead a Jap sniper tumbled and lay still . <P> In the Pacific , as they had in Italy , U.S. dogs of war were proving themselves . On Bougainville , where the dogs got their first combat test , many a Marine took a dim view of them . Said one : " The damned things would get loose and they would go around biting hell out of everybody . " But by the time the Marines got to Guam , dogs as well as handlers were veterans ; the Marines were more used to them . <P> The Meaner the Better . Guam 's fighting kennel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherds , a few other breeds . Their skill at ferreting out snipers terrified the Japs there from the beginning . One dog chased four Japs into a cave , where they committed suicide with grenades rather than fight it out . All the animals are trained to attack and kill on signal . Said a sergeant handler : " They are mean dogs and we make them meaner . " <P> Some are trained as messengers , taught to trust only two handlers . They will carry messages from one of these men to the other over all kinds of terrain , against all kinds of odds , avoiding anyone else , attacking anyone , Jap or American , who tries to stop them . On a test through heavy jungle one dog covered 1,600 yds. in four-and-a-half minutes . It took a Marine runner eleven minutes to cover the same ground . If necessary a dog can carry 150 rounds of ammunition in a saddle pack . <P> At night , while star shells , flares , bomb flashes flicker across the Guam sky , faint barks can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sentries , ready to give warning if the Japs try to work into the Marines ' lines . <P> Three dogs have been killed on Guam , one wounded ; one is missing . Luckiest dog was Tippy , who was guarding a foxhole when a mortar shell hit . One Marine was killed . Tippy was blown six feet into the air but suffered only a stiffened rear end .
