Colonel Philip Bracken Fleming is a small , good-humored and efficient man who pounds around Washington on steel-capped heels . The colonel , who is 53 , a West Point graduate and an Army engineer , loves poker , good company and a moderate amount of good liquor . Logical , simple and direct , he despises ostentation . When he was coordinator of the Resettlement Administration , he got sick of Administrator Rexford Tugwell 's bright young men who loved to sit around the conference table waggling their Phi Beta Kappa keys . One day the colonel marched into conference , casually threw back his coat and exposed , on a heavy brass chain , a souvenir hotel key large enough to choke a horse . Last week the colonel scored another point , just as quietly . <P> Since February 1940 , Colonel Fleming has administered the controversial wages &; hours act . He has administered it with precise efficiency . Recently the act , which requires industry to pay time and a half for overtime over 40 hours a week , has come under attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of General Motors Corp. , who recommended that the " penalty for overtime should be canceled during the emergency to encourage a longer work week . " Colonel Fleming , like a good military tactician , waited until he was ready to counterattack . First he got Mr. Sloan 's opinions in writing . Then he got a good radio spot . Last week he replied . <P> Counter-Attack . Said the colonel : " If I found that the overtime penalty was interfering with defense production , I would report my observation to the President just as fast as a sentry reports the presence of the enemy . ... I have found no such thing . Defense industries have not been asking to be relieved of the overtime penalty . ... I have had no complaints from the airplane industry . " * <P> Colonel Fleming countered Mr. Sloan 's argument that paying overtime was a step towards inflation , by pointing to General Motors ' last annual statement , which showed a total pay roll of $386,000,000 , profits of $183,000,000 . Said the colonel : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% was realized in profits . ... I wonder if that old inflation bugaboo looks in the window at businessmen when they are confronted with profits - and scares them just as he does when they are confronted with wage increases . I called it a bugaboo because inflation does not begin until production capacity , through a shortage of machines , raw materials or workers , can not meet increased demands . " He declared , overlooking the fact that there are already serious shortages in several vital industries : " We are a long way from that point . " Said the colonel finally : " Labor must be dealt with in good faith if we are to enter this dangerous New Era with national unity . " <P> Crossed Lines . Ideally the rearmament program should be progressing in three neat parallel lines of administration , management , labor . But last week the lines were wavering , crossing , occasionally colliding head on . Congressmen raised longer and louder cries for legislation outlawing strikes in defense industries . The President himself had said : " The nation expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lockouts . " Among the crossed-up lines last week :
