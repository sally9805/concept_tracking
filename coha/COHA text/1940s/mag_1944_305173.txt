" Sure , I get $7 a day , but I only work half the year . " <P> The peacetime fear of layoffs , tarnishing the luster of high U.S. wage rates , has already begun to haunt thoughtful war workers looking ahead to war 's end . But when C.I.O. United Steelworkers launched their attack on the Little Steel formula , their demand for a guaranteed annual wage was generally regarded as a mere bargaining point to be dropped when the going got rough . By last week , however , this anemic talking point had grown into a full-blooded issue . In a flurry of lusty Washington argument it had spread far beyond steel , threatened to involve most of U.S. industry . <P> Taxes and Workers . U.S. Steel 's President Benjamin F. Fairless , opening the industry 's counterattack before a WLB panel , last week asserted bluntly : " It is both impractical and illusory . ... The demand for such a revolutionary change becomes fantastic unless the eventual insolvency of the steel industry is desired . " <P> Next day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Senator James Murray 's War Contracts subcommittee . He wanted Congressional blessing for the annual wage ; not compulsory legislation , but approval of the principle . He felt that this would help unions get annual-wage provisions written into contracts , thus provide a safeguard against postwar layoffs . His argument : industry has been guaranteed postwar profits for two years through " carry-back and carry-forward " tax provisions . Farmers have been guaranteed 90% of parity prices on crops . Why should not workers be guaranteed a full year 's pay for a full year 's work ? <P> Surprisingly Georgia 's conservative Senator George , chairman of the Senate 's Postwar Committee , substantially agreed . Said he : " What we have tried to do in our agricultural and tax legislation is quite capable of application to the worker . . . . I think we ought to lean toward something like the annual-wage idea . " <P> But if U.S. industry were to institute an annual wage , how would it work ? How could it be made to work ? <P> Soap and Shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But only a trifling number of U.S. companies have been brave enough to try it out in fact . One of the first was Procter &; Gamble ( Crisco , Ivory Soap ) , in 1923 . Its socially conscious president , the late William Cooper Procter , felt that the " outstanding evil " of the U.S. economic system was its in ability to provide steady employment , decided to guarantee all P. &; G. workers 48 weeks of work a year . Working out such a plan was not simple . Although the consumer demand for soap is year-around , wholesalers bought spasmodically and P. &; G. production paralleled their orders . President Procter overhauled his sales system , leveled out production . The changes cost $3,000,000 , but P. &; G. has since repeatedly hailed the system as well worth it . Ten thousand employes in P. &; G. 's main plants are now covered by it . <P> In 1935 Milwaukee 's Nunn-Bush Shoe Company set up a " 52-pay-checks-each-year " plan at small expense . It has been handsomely repaid in increased worker efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan are shoe indus try 's highest paid . Estimated income ( excluding supervisors ) last year : $2,300.
