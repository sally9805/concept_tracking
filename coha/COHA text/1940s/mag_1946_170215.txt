For half of his 65 years , John James Audubon did not appear to be destined for anything in particular . The bastard son of a French sea captain and a Santo Domingo Creole , he grew up in France when Jean Jacques Rousseau 's back-to-nature notions were the rage . Sent to America to seek his fortune ( as overseer of his father 's estate near Philadelphia ) , young Audubon looked and acted like an absentminded candidate for the horsy set . <P> As he remembered it ( in his journal ) : " I had no vices but was thoughtless and pensive , fond of shooting , fishing and riding ... as active and agile as a buck . " He married a girl named Lucy and opened ' a general store in Henderson , Ky. , which flopped from the first . Audubon had to go hunting to fill the cupboard . <P> Reality on Wires .
