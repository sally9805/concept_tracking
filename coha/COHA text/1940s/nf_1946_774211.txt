txt  | develops an attitude of group exclusiveness and jealousy toward other institutions , government included . Another factor explaining the growing power of pressure groups is that government has become so large and strong that pressure groups need adequate reporting and surveillance devices if their interests are to be protected and their influence is to be registered . This observation applies particularly to the federal government and the larger state governments , where the multiplicity of programs is sometimes confusing even to one familiar with the government information manual . Weekly or monthly reporting services , such as that of W. N. Kiplinger , and the referenda methods of interest groups , such as that of the United States Chamber of Commerce , are among the most valuable means whereby groups keep constantly informed and are enabled to swing into action through their paid lobbyists .

The public interest , says the lobbyist , is the program that gets support and keeps it . Government is neutral , something to be used ; it has no morals because it is merely a tool . This is the widespread view of government as broker , summarized by Jay Gould of the Erie Railroad who once told a legislative committee : " In a Republican district I was a Republican ; in a Democratic district I was a Democrat ; in doubtful districts I was doubtful ; but I was always Erie . " Most lobbyists assume that their organization stands for principles while the soulless government has none . The prevailing opinion seems to be that we should use the government because we must , but that we should not become attached to it . Samuel Gompers , the Grand Old Man of the American Federation of Labor , once said : " We must be partisan for a principle and not for a. party . Labor must learn to use parties to advance our principles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is the language of almost every interest seeking favors or noninterference from government . The Election of Safe or Friendly Candidates When powerful interests enter the political arena to back and elect their own candidates , they become a far more serious threat to good government than when they merely use political parties to purchase action and immunity . Either is serious enough , but the practice of " owning " legislators and executives is dangerous . Sometimes an interest group finances the campaign of one of its own officers or employees ; if he wins he is sure to be more than cooperative . In this case , however , the connection with the interest is so obvious that footnote Quotal in M. Ostrogorski , I ) i'n , nrrdry and Mc Oi 4rrni nt/lin n l'nlitirdl l , riie , ( Jrw Yrn ' 1 ; ,  | the successful candidate may not prove as valuable as another .

They are constantly sponsoring or opposing something that affects their group . Touch their sensitive points and they immediately react . The testimony of a New Jersey legislator is applicable elsewhere : " A new member of the legislature , " said he , " soon grows to learn from their actions that certain members speak for the banks , for the insurance companies , for the physicians , and so on . " Fortunately for democracy , this situation is not widespread . Whenever the number of those who can be definitely labeled as spokesmen for particular interests exceeds 5 or 10 per cent of the membership of the legislature , it is time to be seriously worried about the future of liberal democratic government . The Lobby Writes Its Own Ticket A large percentage of the bills introduced in the legislature emanates from lobbies . Sensing that legislation on a particular subject is inevitable , the interest group may draft its own measure , in the expectation that it would be more favorable than a bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors or immunities from government , a friendly legislator may suggest that the lobby write its own ticket and he will introduce it as his measure . Oftener than not , however , the collaboration is between lobby and administrative department rather than between lobby and individual legislator . A department of agriculture in conjunction with the Grange , the Farm Bureau , or the National Farmers Union ? perhaps all three ? will collaborate in drafting a bill ; or the American Federation of Labor and a department of labor ; the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Department of Commerce ; the American Legion and the Veterans Administration ; the National Education Association and the Office of Education ; or the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America and the Federal Security Agency . For each major grouping there is likely to be a corresponding executive agency of the government , and between them much legislation is drafted . Studies of the Ohio Senate made by Professor Harvey Walker at ten-year intervals , 1929 and 1939 , indicated that nearly three fourths of the bills introduced were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of the two . Only one fourth seemed to be the independent work of the senator sponsoring the legislation . Some lobbies maintain research staffs that make those of the government appear insignificant by comparison . The difference is likely to be more pronounced when the comparison is with the legislature , however , than with the executive departments , because in general the legislature is understaffed in the field of research . Moreover , when it comes to drafting bills of its own or  | pointing out the holes in those pending before a legislative committee , a wellfinanced pressure group can afford to purchase the best legal talent available . FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF INTEREST CROUPS In a chapter in The American Political Scene , edited by Edward B. Logan , Harwood Childs cites an example of the funds available to major pressure groups . Of the figures that follow , not all of the money was spent on political activities per se , but directly or indirectly a large percentage was accounted for in that way : figure  | A good picture of expenditures before a state legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It shows the major lobbies which operated , and the expenditures of each , during the 1925 ? 1926 sessions of the Massachusetts legislature . One reason the legislatures commonly spend so little on their research staffs is that the pressure groups would rather do the work for them . If the legislatures are to have more adequate staffs , therefore , for both research and bill drafting , the civic pride of the population as a whole must be relied on to bring it about . And , unfortunately , it is just these interests ? civic and consumer ? which are least organized and least influential . METHODS USED BY LOBBIES TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION The techniques of lobbying have changed considerably in a generation . Bribery of officials or their outright control has been found a costly procedure . It is likely to boomerang . Many an executive has said , " When we spend money directly to control legislators , they usually end up by blackmailing us ; the business can not stand this kind of adverse publicity . " Dinner parties of the kind made famous by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the buttonholing of legislators and threats of what the pressure group would do to them ? made famous in the fight of the Antisaloon League ? are today frowned on by the skillful and successful lobbyist . He has become more suave . He is more interested in the long pull , the underlying good will , and less disposed to use bludgeoning methods . In the biography of Uncle Joe Cannon , written by L. W. Busbey , we are told that " the old-fashioned lobbyist no longer cuts any figure in Washington because for him we have substituted what may be called politics by propaganda . The way to secure legislation and escape all suspicion of ulterior motive , is to form an association and proclaim its object as moral . " The next step is to constitute a front committee of names ? respected citizens whose motives will not be impugned . But the paid lobbyists do the real work , for it is they who have the finesse . They haunt the corridors of the legislature , keeping a finger on the pulse of Congress at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providing data . They make friends in the legislature they can rely on , and size up those who are doubtful or hostile . Meantime , the strategy is to manipulate propaganda in favor of or against particular measures . In this it must be made to appear that the people back home arc expressing themselves spontaneously , without artificial stimulation from a central headquarters , although in fact such expressions are often spontaneous . Some of the more common methods of present-day lobbyists are these : To stand in well with the party leaders . During a Congressional investigation of the Sugar Trust in 894 , the president of that organization said , " Wherever there is a dominant party , wherever the majority is very large , that is the party that gels the contribution , because that is the party that controls the real  | matters . " But to play it safe , one should contribute to both parties as , in fact , many prominent people do . To analyze the members of the legislature . To get a clear idea of how they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many lobbyists now maintain a card catalogue , classifying the members of the legislature as friendly , doubtful , or hostile . Some interest groups even go so far as to send out questionnaires to candidates in advance of the election , asking for personal data and their reactions to particular public issues as well as to specific problems in which the lobby is interested . If the group is thought to influence a large number of votes , the candidate will feel it unwise to refuse the invitation to fill out the questionnaire , however reluctant he may be . Once he is on record his commitments hang over his head , pledging him in advance to a certain course of action if he is elected . Lobbyists then use these statements to advantage w ' ' ten bills in which they are interested come before the legislature of which he is a member . To influence the choice of presiding officers , committee chairmen , and appointees to committees affecting the group 's interests . A Senate investigation brought to light a letter from the files of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We are making a very serious effort to get some friends on the next Rivers and Harbors Committee of the House . A great deal of important legislation will be referred to that committee dealing with waterways and particularly the operation of the Federal Barge Line . " c To draft legislation and provide information and friendly counsel . This area of activity has been covered in the preceding discussion . To present testimony at committee hearings affecting the interest group and to attend others of related interest . This is the most open and aboveboard method the lobby can use . Sometimes the paid lobbyist attends and testifies in person , but more often prominent members of the group are brought in from distant points . Hearing from the folks back home usually has more effect on legislators than testimony by paid lobbyists . To confer with legislators in their offices or in the lobby of the legislature . This also is an open method and much used . Some lobbyists have a regular beat similar to that of a professional newspaperman . Naturally they concentrate on members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually each lobbyist has one or more key men on his string , legislators on whose confidence and sympathy he can rely . If he works for a farm lobby they will be from farm states ; if for a labor lobby , from industrial centers in which organized labor is strong ; if for a war veterans ' organization , the legislator probably will turn out to be a veteran himself . Letters and telegrams from constituents back home . The work of the lobbyist , like that of the successful executive , is largely a matter of skillful timing . He must know when to turn on the heat . As the bill in which he is interested footnote ' Qunirl by V. O. Krv , l ( ; n , np ; , ? I , . ri ( . , p. 216.  | moves through committee and proceeds to the floor and finally to a vote , the flood of letters and telegrams to legislators will increase until it reaches a peak just before zero hour . The most potent pressure group , says columnist Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest number of letters and telegrams . " This is doubtless true . Telegrams are like votes ? they measure power and influence , and to ignore constituents who send them is to court defeat at the next election . However , it is a method which must be used with care , for much depends on the manner in which it is employed . If all the telegrams in a Iparticula campaign are identical they are less persuasive than if they reveal  | some spontaneity . Moreover , many independent legislators are more annoyed by such demonstrations than influenced by them . A recent development in the program of the United States Chamber of Commerce has been the organization of national affairs committees ? the N.A.C. ? for the purpose of making congressmen so aware of the local businessman that the political effect will be positive and sharp . " Certain minority groups with anti-business leanings are stronger and fiercer than ever before , " says the handbook of the N.A.C. " Business can no longer sit back and merely hope that Congress will act wisely and well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress does about them . " The program of the N.A.C. includes organizing active local units , sending congressmen letters of appreciation for their " good votes , " sending them " fine large pictures of native scenery . . . for their offices , " as well as " some local food product which they can have served to their colleagues in House and Senate restaurants . " The handbook of the N.A.C. concludes with the admonition that " stereotyped form letters wo n't give a senator courage , or information , or insight ? or even the willies . But 1,000 individual letters , written from information provided by the N.A.C. , can head in , smoke out or buck up any man who votes on Capitol Hill ! " 7 A Washington representative of a large farm organization once boasted that " he could have delivered to Senators more than 150,000 telegrams in forty-eight hours , favoring or opposing any pending measure , whether it dealt with agriculture or not . He candidly admitted that most of the telegrams would be synthetic , inspired , directed and paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective for that . " S Lobbying has become big business . To the telegraph companies it must be almost as lucrative a source of revenue as horseracing . Friendship , social activities , dinner parties . Many lobbyists are chosen because they are good mixers . In recent years this factor has played an increasingly important role . In the vicinity of Washington , for example , certain lobbyists have established attractive country homes where on almost any week end while Congress is in session members of that body may be found mixing socially with the host and his carefully selected friends . Riding , fishing , mint juleps , and other diversions are on the list . Outwardly , these week-end dates are merely social . Usually no " business " is discussed at such times , but later the genial host may feel assured of an open door and a friendly welcome when he makes his legislative rounds . Propaganda techniques . Propaganda methods , widely used by interest groups , may be immediate or long range .

In the famous public-utility investigation of 1928-1929 , which laid bare the most ambitious lobby this country has ever seen , " everything but skywriting " was employed , to quote Odegard and Helms . The attempt here was to influence the fundamental beliefs and preferences of the American people : " We are going to their the legislators ' ) constituents which is our constitutional right , " said the lobby . " We are going to depend upon the back fire . " There was a back fire , but not the kind the lobby expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , there was virtually no limit to what the " educational " campaign of the utility lobby might attempt . One advertising agency was paid $84,000 a year to supply " canned " editorials on utility matters and claimed to have secured over 65,000 pages of space in four years . Clubs were furnished with speaker 's handbooks . Special public-utility research bureaus were financed in universities , and professors were paid high salaries for allowing their names to be used in connection with this activity . It was an advertising man 's dream . But like so many public relations stunts , it was oversold . When the federal government investigated the power lobby and publicized the results , ' the public conscience was shocked . The people are in no danger of losing their sense of morality and fitness , even if some of the lobbyists are . It takes legislators of integrity and stamina to stand up against the aggressions of modern lobbies . If one technique does not work , the lobbies will use another . Fortunately , there is less outright corruption of public officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for this we can be thankful . Professor John D. Hicks , author of The Populist Revolt , in commenting on the domination of state governments in the West by lobbies , remarks : " It is not unfair to say that normally the railroads , sometimes a single road , dominated the political situation in every Western state . . . . For a long time ... by fair means or foul , their wishes in most localities were closely akin to law . " The late Senator Hiram Johnson of California , who in his early career was a Progressive supporting Theodore Roosevelt , got his early reputation as Governor of California by smashing the Southern Pacific Ring . When he established a regulatory commission for railroads , one of the railroad officials remarked , " So they are going to regulate the railroads , eh ? Well , then , the railroads must regulate the regulators .

The lot of the public-spirited legislator is not an easy one . Political scientist Charles E.

" Is it any wonder that Teddy Roosevelt believed the best fight for red-blooded men to be in the field of politics ? PRINCIPLES RELATING TO PRESSURE POLITICS If popular government does not remain free and independent , it will ultimately be converted into something else . Interest domination and popular control mix no better than oil and water . At the same time , the right to argue for individual interests and to state the case publicly is equally essential . A free government should hesitate to impose prohibitions on pressure groups even when they attempt to importune legislators . Freedom of the interest group to petition the legislature is akin to freedom of the press and freedom of assembly . There can be no question , therefore , as to the right of interest groups to organize and to express themselves , but this does not mean that their methods should not be questioned . Certain principles of legitimate lobbying may be suggested : Lobbying should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attempts to influence public opinion should be acknowledged by the group sponsoring the propaganda , and the public has a right to expect that dummy organizations will not be used . The public also has a right to demand that the integrity of its legislators will be respected at all times . Hence bribery should be severely punished and bludgeoning methods made impossible by the force of public opinion and legislative disapprobation . If Congress and the state legislatures would crack down on arrogant lobbyists in the way in which they sometimes put cocky administrators in their place , the problem would be half solved . Former legislators should not be permitted to take advantage of their privileged positions to become lobbyists and hence exercise undue influence . And finally , the ultimate solution is to improve our education of future public leaders so that they will have a higher sense of morality and a finer consciousness of what constitutes the public interest .  | ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE LOBBYING Congress and more than thirty of the states have attempted to regulate lobbying through legislation of one kind or another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation is registration , designed to satisfy the requirement of openly acknowledged sponsorship . This is a particularly vexatious problem , and if it could be solved , the question of lobbying also could be largely solved . For example , in the course of an investigation of railroad holding companies , Senator Wheeler said : " There are too many of these organizations going around the country claiming they represent , we will say farmers in one case , or security holders in another case , or somebody else in another case , when as a matter of fact they are being financed by somebody who is vitally interested in the pending legislation . Frequently it is a case of misrepresentation to the Members of the Congress of the United States ... " Legislation regulating lobbies was passed in 1928 and again in 1936 , and because Congress annually seems more concerned with the problem , it is possible that these are but initial steps . Present provisions are aimed at specific difficulties , however , and are not general . Utility lobbyists , for example , are required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are required to file detailed statements . In some of the states lobbies are required to register with the legislature or the governor . Massachusetts in 1890 and Wisconsin in 1899 pioneered in this field . To Wisconsin belongs the credit for enforcing its law more satisfactorily than any other state . Registration regulations among the states customarily require all " legislative counsel and agents " to be registered by their employers with the legislature . After each session a statement of expenditure must be filed . Sometimes a statement must also be made as to the measures the lobby is interested in and the amounts paid in salaries . Lobbyists are forbidden to appear on the floor of the legislative chamber . In recent years there has been an extension of provisions of this kind but the greatest fault is lax enforcement . Legislatures also attempt to control lobbying activity by the publicity derived from special investigations . Congress has often investigated the evils of lobbying . Especially notable were the inquiries of 1913 and 1935 , but the probing of tariff lobbies runs back to the beginning of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , especially when the abuse was serious . The investigation of the power lobby in Congress in 1928 ? 1929 is a case in point . The present provisions of Congressional law grew out of special investigations of utility lobbying and shipping contracts . At the state level a few of the states have gone much further than others in imposing penalties for improper lobbying activities . Some state laws have forbidden lobbying or have provided a punishment in case of misrepresentation.  | Georgia has dealt with the matter in her constitution , in which lobbying is declared a crime when it consists in a misrepresentation of interest . Alabama makes lobbying for or against a measure a misdemeanor . Moreover , to attempt to influence legislation " corruptly " is a felony . In Louisiana , any attempt influence legislation except through " an appeal to reason " is punishable b fine and imprisonment . These are real teeth , but enforcement is a different matter . The interpretation of terms is not easy . What is meant , for example , by " an appeal to reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? All of law and government , unfortunately , are filled with words which have many and confusing connotations . In the end the control of lobbies comes down largely to a matter of enforcement . When the law of Ohio specifically prohibits the appearance of lobbyists in the legislative chamber , but they are nevertheless allowed to appear in large numbers , it is not surprising that regulation has not been more effective . An Official Third House of the Legislature ? Instead of attempting to regulate the aggressions of the pressure groups , why not recognize their inevitability and . even their desirability ? Why not create a third house of the legislature in which representation would be functional by interest rather than geographical by district ? Such a plan has been seriously urged . This would constitute a sort of national council of business , labor , agriculture , the professions , and all the other major groupings . Each would be free , it is argued , to advocate its own interests . An atmosphere of mutual criticism would encourage a fair give and take . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups might be more moderate than at first . At the conclusion of this process Congress could then legislate with more wisdom and assurance . It is held that this arrangement would take the heat off Congress and the state legislatures and permit a lot to go up in the air during the debates in the Third House . There are plausible features in such a plan . If a force can not be discouraged or redirected , the only recourse is to give it official status . In the past this has proved a sound rule of government . In their book outlining a plan for the socialist commonwealth of Great Britain , Sidney and Beatrice Webb advocated two national chambers ? the present Parliament to deal with political and strictly governmental affairs ; and a coordinate body , to be created , to deal with economic matters such as national planning and stability . But where would the dividing line come in such an arrangement ? Is any realistic line of demarcation feasible ? It would seem inevitable , furthermore , that eventually one or the other of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would gain the upper hand . It would also seem certain that the inevitable overlappings and ronllict Nvoul1 result in a dangerous situation leading to vacuity  | and drift . Further , is it wise public policy for the government to formalize and encourage selfish interests , or should government concentrate on reconciling and blending conflicting interests for the sake of the public interest ? Questions such as these provoke interesting speculation . WHERE DO PRESSURE POLITICS LEAD US ? The underlying philosophy of pressure politics can become a philosophy of government , but not the philosophy of popular rule . If we assume that men and the groups they form are so selfish that civic interest can not rise above special interest , that government is to be callously exploited rather than supported , and that economic groups should go their own way without reference to government or the public welfare , then we may expect an eventual change in the democratic form of government . Pressure politics rely on the kind of philosophy which underlies guild socialism , fascism , and philosophical anarchy . Guild socialism , like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of production . The distinctive feature here is emphasis on nonpolitical groups , the guilds or economic interests , with a resulting diminution of political organization and activity . Under guild socialism , there is provision for the type of functional representation of special interests in legislative bodies here described . Italian fascism , as it was developed by Mussolini and his Black Shirts from 1923 to 1944 , was also based on the idea of functional representation . Capital , labor , and agriculture , along with all other group interests , were organized into corporations , and representation in the legislature was by means of these groups . The corporative state did not permit representation by individuals or by geographic areas , so that the legislature became as dead as the dodo . The corporations were stage property and had no real power or influence . A single party , with a dictator as the head of the state , ruled unassisted . And finally , under philosophical anarchy , the emphasis is on the absence of government and its restraints and interferences . It is largely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were cooperative ? if life could be kept simple , groups kept small and close to the people ? then large , artificial institutions such as government would not be necessary and men would be happier . This , at least , is the theory . It is not suggested that an intensification of guild tendencies would lead us inevitably to one or another of these forms of society . New forms of government are constantly emerging from the peculiar circumstances of a people ? witness Italian fascism , German nazism , and Russian communism in the recent past . They are difficult to classify under Aristotle 's threefold design of monarchy , aristocracy , and democracy.10 But since government is the product of all the forces and all the institutions of which a society is comprised , permutations and modifications of basic patterns arc to be expected . footnote ' " Scc ( ' h.ti uc 53 , " ' I'hc Future of Popular Govcrnmcnt in the UM ! , ti States . "  | William Allen White , as noted above , called attention to the changes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? changes more profound than those resulting from constitutional amendments . Unless we can substitute a more public-spirited attitude for the philosophy of selfishness and power ? paying greater heed to the strengthening of leadership and responsibility in political parties and legislatures and moderately but effectively regulating the lobbies ? we may expect these changes in our system of government to proceed at an accelerated pace .

John Stuart Mill , Jeremy Bentham , and others referred to as the utilitarians were among the first to recognize the necessity of emphasizing policy equally with machinery , or process . We have tended to forget this guiding principle of statecraft . The study of government has come to be considered by many writers as a study merely of power , influence , and leadership . This is all right as far as it goes , but it does not go far enough . John Stuart Mill saw more deeply into the wisdom of statecraft when he said , " Power is a means to an end . " It is not enough to know how law is made and what the pressures and institutional difficulties are which attend that process .

This is not the exclusive task of the economist , the sociologist , or the lawyer . It is equally ? and perhaps even more peculiarly ? the responsibility of the political scientist . The founders of political science , Plato and Aristotle , conceived of statecraft as the integrating science of society , with branches dealing with ethics , law , family life , religion , wealth , and the contributions of the physical sciences to the general welfare . The utilitarians and the founding fathers of the American constitutional system had a similar view . We moderns can not afford to think in lower and more segmented terms . Legislation is the life of the modern community . What are its objectives and priorities ? what Bentham called the agenda of the state ? What are the areas of public policy which we , along with the nation 's lawmakers , should be thinking about ? In this chapter a discussion of the bases of popular government precedes the study of the extension of governmental activities and the influence of technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public business , and the role of government in the areas of economics , social NvuIIarc , and  | international relations . The chapter concludes with a brief summary of the science of legislation . THE BASES OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT The bases of popular government which are to be emphasized especially here are the widely shared acceptance of public values , a cultivation of public morality , a proper balance between government and particular groups in the interest of the public good , and the reconciliation of freedom and restraint . Widely Shared Public Values For its stability and progress popular government relies on values and appreciations which are widely shared among the people . So do other forms of government such as aristocracy and monarchy , but not to the same degree nor for the same reasons . In minority governments , power is concentrated in the hands of a few . Having the power of the government and the media of propaganda at their command , the rulers are in a position to sharpen objectives and manipulate the people to their own ends . But where everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public policy , the agreements reached must grow up freely and be widely shared or society will be characterized by confusion bordering on anarchy . The grand strategy of a democracy is to widen these areas of agreement by education , discussion , and mutual accommodation until at length both the values and the means to their attainment are clear . John Stuart Mill , in his essay on Liberty , stated this need in a passage which deserves attention . " As mankind improves , " said Mill , " the number of doctrines which are no longer disputed or doubted will be constantly on the increase : and the well-being of mankind may almost be measured by the number and gravity of the truths which have reached the point of being uncontested . " In this statement Mill did not counsel a fundamentalism excused from the necessity of further investigation , modification , and improvement . Rather , his point was that democracy depends on widely shared values and consents , for they alone are insurance against domination and enforced compliance . This is a truth which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also depends on widespread civic morality . If all interests were narrowly selfish and all officials willing to sell their influence to the highest bidder , our shared participation in government would hardly last a lifetime . Machiavelli was perhaps the first political scientist to teach that government is amoral . You must flatter the public to prevent it from overthrowing you , he told the Prince ; but otherwise you must rely on power and manipulation to gain your ends . Machiavelli thought that morality was needed in private but footnote J , I ; , ? ? I a , ? shins . l lc aunt ( l that gov &; rnntcnt is inherl ? mtly power aUl  | domination , and hence does not need to be moral . He did not attempt to explain this inconsistency ; he merely assumed it . The utilitarians were wiser . They realized that the state is simply the totality of its individuals and that if individuals are expected to be moral , the state also must be moral . Most people today would subscribe to this belief , as attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . If a man enjoys living in a free society , it is good business for him to have ideals . Public morality , like private morals , must often be acquired , as John Stuart Mill pointed out in a passage in his essay " Utilitarianism " : " If ... the moral feelings are not innate , but acquired , " said Mill , " they are not for that reason the less natural . It is natural to man to speak , to reason , to build cities , to cultivate the ground , though these are acquired faculties . The moral feelings are not indeed a part of our nature , in the sense of being in any perceptible degree present in all of us . . . Like the other acquired capacities . . . they are capable , in a certain small degree , of springing up spontaneously ; and susceptible of being brought by cultivation to a high degree of development . " With this preface to morals , we turn now to the concerns of the lawmaker , the chief architect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter on lobbying pointed out that the relation of political government to other governing groups ? labor , agriculture , and business , for example ? is a central problem of modern life . On its skillful adjustment depends , to a considerable extent , the future of popular government . This has been graphically stated by Charles E. Merriam in Recent Social Trends . Summarizing the principal governmental problems that he foresees , Professor Merriam underscores " the wide ranging and paradoxical tendency to boycott government as a general instrument of social control , while utilizing it as an agency of personal or group profit . " ' The boycott of government ? If a boycott implies nonutilization of services , then boycott is the wrong word . Not boycott , but an attitude of cynical disregard for government ; an inadequate appreciation of the duties and opportunities of citizenship ; a lack of proper appreciation and support for the services rendered . What can be done about an attitude of this kind ? Must it simply be concluded that it is part of the frontier tradition and that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible to change it now by an argument which takes two main lines . The first is an appeal to the intelligence ? to the intelligent self-interest of the citizen : government should be supported because interest groups find it to their advantage to support it . Interest groups have one function ; the government has another . Interest groups can not govern the country and deal with foreign powers ; the government can . Interest groups prosper only so long as the nation prospers ; if government is not free , they will not be free . footnote Rrrr , i Social Trends ( Vrw York , M ( raa-11111 Rook Cowan 103 ; 1 , i ) . 1516. p 416 The intellectual argument is strong but incomplete if not accompanied by an appeal to the sentiments . The loyalties of the average man and woman are broad , including within their scope the family , the church , economic attachments , and the nation . Both the group and the government , therefore , must be served and respected . This is our duty and our privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also our interest , because so long as government serves human ends ? and these are identical with the public welfare ? men should support government cheerfully because its ends are their objectives . John Stuart Mill 's treatment of this subject is unexcelled . What are the guiding considerations that the moralist and the legislator ( in this period the two were generally linked ) should keep in mind ? The ultimate sanction of all morality , says Mill , is " the conscientious feelings of mankind . " Selfishness is the chief foe of society ; lack of mental cultivation is next . There is no necessary conflict between private and public interest . Ethics involves a sense of duty , but most of what we do is from other motives . We act on the basis of " utility , " which is a combination of right thinking and right sentiments . It is a matter of education and environment . " Genuine private affection , and a sincere interest in the public good , " says Mill , " are possible , though in unequal degrees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Freedom and Restraint In society , freedom and restraint are equally necessary . " The only freedom which deserves the name , " says Mill , " is that of pursuing our own good in our own way , so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs , or impede their efforts to obtain it . " And the necessity of restraint ? the control of government over individuals and groups ? is equally convincing . " All that makes existence valuable to anyone , " says Mill , " depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people . Some rules of conduct , therefore , must be imposed , by law in the first place , and by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law . " Note Mill 's argument on these points : Everyone who receives the protection of society owes it a return for such benefits . There are certain indispensable rules which must be observed . The first of these is avoiding injury to the interests of one another ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second is particularly interesting in the present context , as it consists in " each person 's bearing his share ( to be fixed on some equitable principle ) of the labors and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation . " Society , says Mill , is justified in enforcing these conditions at all costs on those who do not willingly cooperate . The basic principle is that as soon as any part of a person 's conduct prejudicially affects the interest of others , society has jurisdiction over it ; and the question whether the general welfare will orb mill not be promoted by interfering with it becomes open to discussion . II is h ( S'nnd the Scope ( 1I this deiptcr to go eXICnsive ? ly 1111 ( 1 the pr.irtic , il  | applications of the principles of legislation and morality brought out here . Later in the book that will be attempted . " Nor is it proposed to tell the reader what he should think about controversial issues . The sole purpose of this chapter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hoped thereby to raise questions so compelling that further investigation will be stimulated . The questions of the relation of government to interest groups , and of public to private interests , form the nexus around which many problems of legislation revolve today . To mention but a few , there are tariffs , subsidies , crop loans , the limitation of monopoly profits , and the right of labor to organize . To quote again from Recent Social Trends , " How shall we blend the skills of government , industrial and financial management , agriculture , labor and science in a new synthesis of authority , uniting power and responsibility , with vivid appeal to the vital interest of the day , able to deal effectively with the revolutionary developments of our social , economic and scientific life , yet without stifling liberty , justice and progress ? " 3 EXTENSIONS OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITY Clashes between rival groups always add to the responsibilities of government . The farmers wanted the railroads regulated ; the railroads called for the control of the trucking companies ; the truckers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle . Government is a referee between competing groups ; during times of intense activity , therefore , the expansion of governmental activities may be expected to proceed most rapidly . In a democratic government there are likely to be many social conflicts , because in a free society they are allowed , whereas under the rule of the dictator they are not . Social conflict leads to added public expense and effort , but it is justified on the ground of preserving freedom . ' Although government as general coordinator and referee is situated above other groups , most of its functions are determined by their pressures and needs . Government appears sometimes to be dominant , but actually it is always the servant , so far as at least one section of society is concerned . Government 's functions ebb and flow with the motion of constituent groups . When dangerous tensions exist , government must step in . When private resources can not take care of vital needs , the government must meet them or pave the way for others to do so . To the extent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities stand still or decline . But to the extent that other groups can not make such provision , or in so doing create additional problems , then public responsibility expands . There is a time lag , however , between the emergence of a social problem footnote " Parts Nine through Twelve , dealing with our principal domestic and international problems as a nation and as individuals . a Loc. cit. , pp. 1540-1541. 4 See Walter Lipp:muur , The Good . Bonnet , ( New York , I'I i I.  | and the move by government to deal with it . Hence we find that much of the demand for legislation by interest groups is due to the effect of social lag . It takes time for incipient problems to become so acute that someone starts a campaign seeking legislation . It takes more time to propagandize and organize public opinion , and to interest the appropriate committee of the legislature . At this stage , things have gone so far that there is usually some opposition , leading to further delays . And finally , the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles . By the time a bill is finally enacted , therefore , the opportunities for preventative action are gone and the cure is more difficult . Technology and Social Change Invention has had a greater effect on modern government than any other factor . Technology is invention leading to increased power and production , to laborsaving devices , to the need for large capital investments , to standardization and the division of labor , to large corporate organizations with rules and procedures not unlike those of a national government . The steam engine and electrical power produced modern industry , caused people to congregate in cities , and created new problems of ownership , distribution , investment , economic balance , labor relations , housing , health , and welfare . A change in any part of society affects every other part , and since government is so central in all of life , it receives the cumulative force of all these factors that stimulate social change . The extent to which modern society is influenced by technology is illustrated in the number of corporations in the United States having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 419 ) . Of the many implications for government in the development of technology some of the more important will be mentioned here . Large-scale private enterprise concentrates economic power in the hands of a few , as shown in the following list of billion dollar corporations . If , as usually happens , concentration leads to new demands on government to act as regulator and referee , then corresponding concentrations are likely to occur in political power . Consequently , the problems of legislation and internal administration multiply . Large-scale private enterprise usually results in the separation of ownership and control.5 There are literally hundreds of thousands of small stockholders participating in the ownership of many of the corporations listed in the following schedule , but individually their control stands at zero . Who , then , is responsible ? It is much like the problem of placing responsibility in government where control by the people is also diffused . The technicalities of legislation , administration , and adjudication multiply ; government increasingly becomes a job for experts . So is the giant corporation . Large size has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See A Toll Berle and Gardiner Means , The Modern Corporation and Private Properly ( New York , 1013 ) , Brinks 1 and -1 .  | figure the need for bureaucratic rules . Society is remolded along increasingly artificial lines . There are more followers and fewer leaders . The temper of democracy is affected . Power politics among competing interests and between the government and the interests are intensified . Size also affects the balance of population , which is attracted to cities , away from rural areas . Farming becomes mechanized . The duties of urban government skyrocket ? housing , slum clearance , transit , city planning , schooling , sanitation , all the communal services of a modern metropolis . People rely increasingly on government , but the problems multiply so fast that efficiency is hard to maintain . Constitutional grants of  | power , furthermore , are not given up without a fight , with the result that while the population and the problems come to be concentrated in the cities , much of the power remains geographically located in the rural areas . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sometimes bewildered when they face such complexities ? WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES OF THE PUBLIC BUSINESS ? The danger arises that government will be called on to do so much ? often of an emergency rather than a preventative nature ? that other essential pro- grams will suffer through lack of attention . A business can usually pick and concentrate on its own activity , taking its own time where it chooses . But in popular government , overburdened legislators and administrators may be forced , as a result of pressure , to take on additional work at the expense of neglecting that which is at least equally important . Domestic programs , for example , always suffer in time of war . The legitimate public business comprises the agenda of the state . The agenda of the state means the irreducible minimum of things the government must ) do to maintain a vital community . Individuals have differing ideas as to just what the agenda of the state should comprise . In licntham 's opinion it was  | very little . But as a result of increasing complexity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government may not always coincide . There can be little doubt , however , as to what government actually does . The figures tell one side of the story . The accompanying charts show the increase in federal government appropriations and the increase in the public debt of the United States over a period of seventy-five years . Other figures are equally illuminating . In 1944 the federal government spent $87 billion on war activities and $3.5 billion on nonmilitary activities , exclusive of interest on the public debt . Of these nonmilitary programs , the Agricultural Conservation and Adjustment Administration , the Veterans Administration , and the Social Security Board were the major beneficiaries , in that order . Other major expenditures were for river and harbor works and flood control , public roads , reclamation projects , and the Farm Security Administration . Out of a total expenditure of nearly $5 billion in 1943 by the forty-eight states , nearly $2 billion were spent on the operations of the government . Of this sum , the largest single item was more than $500 million for public welfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the handicapped ? in that sequence . In addition , a total of more than $822 million was turned over to local subdivisions as state aid to schools , plus $372 million spent  | on state aid for highways . With public welfare , schools , and highways heading the list of state expenditures , here is evidence of the welfare state . And finally for the cities , the figures for 1943 show that of a total of nearly $2 billion spent for operation , $466 million went for public safety and only slightly less for schools . Following these came public welfare , health and hospitals , sanitation , and highways . Here also is evidence of the welfare state . The top expenditures from the federal , state , and local analyses show that military costs , including payments to veterans , outrank all others . But in the nonmilitary category , public welfare and social security come first by a wide margin . Then follow such programs as aid to agriculture , flood control , schools , public safety , and highways . Are these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , do not tell the whole story . The dollar expenditure on foreign relations , for example , is extremely small , and provides no indication of the importance of this nation 's world relationships . The protection of persons and property has long been considered an indispensable function of government , and yet judged by expenditure totals it scarcely deserves mention . Jeremy Bentham long ago expressed a view of its importance that has been re-emphasized . " The business of government , " said Bentham , " is to promote the happiness of the society , by punishing and rewarding . " According to the modern version of this statement , government should act as protector and in some cases as regulator , but beyond this it should not go . GOVERNMENT 'S ROLE IN MAINTAINING ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM An increasing number of citizens , including some conservative businessmen , would say that the most important function of government has yet to be mentioned . It is the duty of the government , they believe , to keep the economy on an even keel. ? Being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to this group , government should concentrate on maintaining economic and social equilibrium . This view was discussed in the chapter on public finance . When individual profits are too high , the government may take the excess in the form of taxes . When new investments are needed , the government may encourage them by favorable tax and profit policies . When the stock market tends to get out of hand , the Federal Reserve System and the Securities and Exchange Commission possess the authority , in part at least , to step in and attempt to prevent a disastrous inflation . When labor and capital can not work together harmoniously , labor relations laws and agencies must be improved . When foreign trade is desirable both domestically and internationally , it is the business of government to encourage repicrocal trade agreements and similar measures . When housing is insufficient and poor , the state should stimulate private building and , if necessary , supplement it with programs of its own . These are examples of what is meant by government as stabilizer . When balance in the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stabilization I'nograinl ul Governmcnt " and " Planning , Stabilization , and F.coII r ' cIlarc.  | tips too far in either direction , it is the job of government to restore it to an even keel . According to this view , the government itself should directly administer only those things that are absolutely necessary . Since the first priority is maintenance of equilibrium , the people and their pressure groups should not encumber legislative halls and executive departments with demands for numerous and unrelated activities . If government allows this to happen , the central job of maintaining an equilibrium must suffer or fail . Of course , government acts as stabilizer today , but does it do so consciously enough and deliberately enough ? Many people , including Beardsley Ruml andHenry Kaiser , apparently think not . Business and Government The main areas of legislative decision with regard to economic equilibria lie in the middle border between business and government . Can business leadership and government leadership work harmoniously together in the public interest ? An antigovernmental policy on the part of business would make such collaboration impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of representative government ? The answer will depend largely on our ability to secure cooperation and consent from the parties of interest . Because representative government depends on voluntary collaboration , the failure of all such groups to work together spells the decline of popular government . What are the alternatives to politico-economic collaboration ? Laissez faire ? It is hardly more than a name , although many people still believe in it . Socialism ? How would it work ? National planning ? What is involved ? Is there a promising intermediate region between laissez faire and socialism ? These questions will be considered in later chapters . The basic problem with regard to economic welfare has been well stated in Recent Social Trends . Comparing the relative shortcomings of government and business , Professor Merriam explains that " if business is closer to technical mechanical efficiency , it is farther from the sense of social responsibility equally important to mankind . Industry as well as government suffers from disorganization and lack of direction , from conspicuous waste and profitable fraud . In the application of modern science and technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial order as well as the government has its tragic moments ? poverty to match war , unemployment to set against extravagance . " 7 Businessmen have the technical skills of production but they are lacking in industrial and governmental statesmanship . It is for this reason , says W. N. Kiplinger in Washington Is Like That , that so few businessmen succeed in high governmental positions . A representative government depends for its success on statesmanship widely distributed among all groups that wield power , footnote 7 rn. , ; f .. p. 1537.  | pressure groups as well as those that are strictly political ; hence it becomes increasingly clear that our country needs large amounts of statesmanship in business , labor , and agriculture ? in all the main segments of the economy as well as in government itself . The American Economic Association has formulated a list of questions illustrative of the difficult and important decisions that must be made in the area of political economy ? the area of government 's responsibility for economic welfare . The questions and their replies are found in the Papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most comprehensive question was this : " In the postwar period , should the United States ( as a matter of long-run policy ) be a nation ( 1 ) of predominantly free private enterprise with relatively little public control ; ( 2 ) of predominantly free private enterprise with substantial control ; ( 3 ) in which public control is predominant ; or ( 4 ) in which public ownership and operation predominate ? " A critical person might find this question difficult to answer when it is stated in this abstract form . What are we to assume ? How much need is there for varying degrees of public regulation and control ? That is the rational , the pragmatic approach . If you and I were to vote our preferences the decision would be easy , but if we were to decide on the basis of practical necessity , the result might be quite different . This question was included in a questionnaire sent to professional economists ; their replies are interesting . Seven times as many voted for the second choice ? predominantly free private enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . The number of those voting for the first and the third alternatives ? little public control or predominantly public control ? was almost exactly equal . Public ownership as the solution received little support . Let us now consider some concrete problems . From your present knowledge and on the assumption that you are at least partially familiar with the problem in each case , how would you answer the question of appropriateness or inappropriateness for each of the functions listed below ? Functions of Government in the Postwar Economy : Appropriateness or Inappropriateness of Function Provide military defense . Maintain law and order . Adjudicate private disputes . Attempt to stabilize the general price level . Assume responsibility for control of business cycle fluctuations . Stabilize prices of particular commodities . Limit corporate profits .

Guarantee cost of production .  | Participate in international agreements to secure stabilized currencies . Provide financial aid to foreign countries for relief and development .

Carry on the existing or proposed projects ( government ownership ) . Reduce tariff barriers . Impose limits on immigration . Take action favoring special groups . Prevent labor abuses .

Source : Papers and Proceedings , 1945 , American Economic Association , pp. 426-431 . Here again , many of these questions are difficult to answer in the abstract . Or perhaps it would he more accurate to say that most of us would want to know mere about the conditions giving rise to these problems before we could favor a particular solution . In the field of public policy it is ha ; ' ; ardotts to vote  | one 's preference unless it has been tested by the particular state of affairs creating the issue to be settled . Such a list does show several things , however . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation that must be decided ? and the complexity of many of them , even for professional economists and political scientists . It shows the extent to which a decision in any one area is bound to affect several others , and it illustrates the need for choosing between alternatives to form a grand strategy of economic welfare . GOVERNMENT AND WELFARE The areas of public policy are as numerous and complex as all of modern life . When , as has been seen in an earlier chapter , government acts in five major capacities ? protector , regulator , assister , operator , and diplomat ? most of human activity is comprehended therein . There is the whole field of foreign policy as well as of domestic policy . Having considered the area of economics , we turn now to that comprehensive and expansible field , the welfare activity of government . Government the world over has become positive instead of negative . It is no longer content merely to protect people , as important in every way as that function is . Governments , especially those controlled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , physical fitness , living conditions , unemployment relief , recreation , and so on . The list of chapter titles in Recent Social Trends ? that comprehensive survey of American life made for President Hoover by a group of distinguished social scientists ? shows that all are related to government and that most have a bearing on the welfare activities of the state . Consider these subjects : Problems of physical heritage ? land , minerals and power ; problems of biological heritage ? quantity and quality of population ; the influence of invention and discovery ; agencies of communication ; shifting occupational patterns ; education ; changing social attitudes and interests ; rural life ; status of racial and ethnic groups ; the vitality of the American people ; the family and its functions ; activities of women outside the home ; childhood and youth ; labor groups in the social structure ; the people as consumers ; recreation and leisure-time activities ; the arts in social life ; changes in religious organizations ; health and medical practice ; crime and punishment ; privately supported social work ; public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for three fourths of the chapter headings in this study . In some fields , such as education , government already has a large financial and organizational stake . Others , especially the social security function , are expanding rapidly . What are the main areas of social policy in which large issues and decisions await solution ? Education is one . How much assistance , for example , should government provide for higher education and research ? What part should the federal authorities play in promoting educational standards ? Popular government depends in large measure on educational opportunities for its continued  | vigor . Today 's problems are so complex that only knowledge ? as contrasted with tradition or preference ? can guide the determination of major decisions . Our schools must go further than the three R 's , and teach our children the meaning of democracy and the public interest . In World War II as in World War I , we Americans discovered that our physical condition is shockingly low . What to do about it raises issues of public policy , in another major area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? Do we need more health education ? Should regulation prevent the destruction of vitamins in the processing of foods ? Should preventive medicine be expanded , the number of hospitals increased , and free clinics established ? How can medicine better serve the masses without losing the valued personal relationship between doctor and patient ? Housing is yet another field in which momentous decisions must be made . Housing is related to the most important concerns of society ? family life , health , individual ownership and pride in home , stimulating pride as citizen . Our city slums are a disgrace . There are not homes enough to go around . The cost of new housing is high . What should we do about it ? Some interests say we can trust unassisted private initiative . Others argue that the government must help finance , but should not become landlord . Still another group believes the public itself must do the job of providing decent housing or it will not be done at all . All of the problems of welfare can not be discussed here because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other points . The next part , for example , will deal with the whole question of court organization , which leads into a host of social problems . For many generations in Western Europe and the United States , the prevailing thought in this field has been that welfare is a personal or religious matter . Spinoza in the seventeenth century and Thomas H. Green , an English political scientist of the nineteenth century , for example , contended that anything affecting the spirit of man ? such as charity , religion , or social service ? should be kept outside the proper realm of state activity . But with the growth of factory towns , mass unemployment , social disease , epidemics , and crime waves , these ideas have changed . We now emphasize the unity of life ? the relation between the body and the spirit ? the entire man . Today the field of welfare is a joint responsibility in the charge of both private and public agencies . How this balance will evolve in the future is one of the most intriguing questions in social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international community will be the subject of several chapters later in the book.8 This section , therefore , will merely raise some questions of capital importance in that area as a means of rounding out this survey of the agenda of the state . footnote " Part " 1'rn , " Isi reign 1 ' . , li V and International Relations  | To what extent , if at all , are we our brothers ' keepers ? If we were to solve our own difficulties and every other nation were to do likewise , it would seem that there could be no serious problems remaining . But in fact there would be , even without the question of the control of atomic energy . How important , for example , is national sovereignty ? Which is the best policy in the long run , national self-sufficiency or free trade and interdependence ? What is to be done about the so-called backward peoples ? About colonies ? About the right of national self-determination ? About financial assistance to areas and peoples of the world where such aid is desperately needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures . Our national government is a union of once independent states . It has been seriously suggested that world organization and world security can learn more from the political experience of the American people and our underlying principles of government than from any other source . If so , a study of American government will serve a double purpose . THE SCIENCE OF LEGISLATION In a field as vast as all of public policy , we have , of necessity , confined ourselves to the high spots . If it has created some understanding of how difficult and diverse are the problems of the legislator , our main purpose has been accomplished . If the appetite has been whetted to know more about these subjects ? the military and protective activities , the relations of business and government , the welfare state , or the nation in the international community ? so much the better . Underlying these concerns is the vital need of combining intellectual analysis with healthy sentiment if the state is to prosper .

Shotwell , The Great Decision ( New York , 1945 ) .  | Politics as a Career EVERY YEAR , hundreds of college-trained men and women go into the government service . Most of them are attracted to the administrative branch , where the demand is greatest , where almost every kind of vocational specialization is needed , and where security and tenure are , on the whole , well established . Another group of college graduates , next only in size to the administrators , studies the law and then fills the numerous positions available in the judicial branch : attorneys ( considered officers of the court ) , judges , city , county , state , and district attorneys , police officials , sheriffs , bailiffs , marshals , clerks of the court , and special police officials such as those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service . The career opportunities in government administration and in the judiciary are dealt with in separate chapters in later parts of the book . ' The third career area , comprising political and legislative leadership , does not afford so large a number of opportunities as administration or law , but the appeal in some ways is greater . This is the subject of the present chapter . POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS It has been seen that the legislature is the center of political gravity , that political parties supply the executive leadership in the legislature , that the jobs of the administrative and judicial branches are largely cut out by the decision-making powers of the legislature , and that the statesmanship that a complex society so badly needs is required in legislation more than in any other field of government . The number of college-trained people in legislative assemblies at all levels municipal , state , and federal ? has shown a marked increase in recent years . Legislation is a complex business and those with special training in the basic fields of public policy ? political science , economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare ? are best able to deal intelligently and penetratingly with the vital problems of the day . But here a caution is necessary . Formal education alone does not suffice ; two other requirements are essential . First , one 's formal education must have developed a deepening of philosophical insight and intellectual penetration . The prospective legislator or political leader must not have merely memorized basic facts ; he must also have learned the techniques of study and analysis . When college-trained men and women lack these qualifications , the self-educated per- footnote ' Chapters 39 , " Administration as a Cvcur , " and ; 2 , " Judicial Office as a Career . "  | son may have more to contribute to leadership and the resolution of social problems than he who has merely acquired a university degree . The second requirement is that one must also possess certain human and social characteristics in order to be prepared for the rough-and-tumble of political life , where leadership is not merely a matter of intelligence but also of appealing to and working with people . The political leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hard knocks and disappointments . He must delight in struggle and in matching wits with opponents , whether they be from the pressure groups or from the other side of the political fence . If he seeks security above all else , the political arena is no place for him . He must love adventure and pioneering . He must know what it is to live by his wits , his ideals , and a rugged integrity . The Prestige of Political Service in Other Countries Great Britain , like the United States , is an industrial , capitalistic nation in which attention might be expected to center largely on business . And yet there the public service from time immemorial has drawn the best-qualified leaders from the universities . How is it possible to account for the attitude prevailing in that country compared with the general indifference toward politics that has become traditional in the United States ? For one thing , prior to the establishment of Parliamentary supremacy in England in 1688 , the men whom the king thought were best qualified were customarily commanded to assist him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended on an aristocracy drawn from among the great landowners , churchmen , schoolmen , and the merchant adventurers . With the advent of Parliamentary supremacy and the development of the cabinet system , electoral reform , the widening of the franchise , and more democratic educational opportunities ? which began early in the nineteenth century and accelerated in the twentieth ? the tradition of aristocracy in the public service continued . There was greater democracy in elections and education , but - the best-trained future leaders still came from the privileged classes . Thus , " In spite of these numerous modifications of the electoral system , " says Professor K. Smellie in the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , " the House of Commons remained predominantly aristocratic in character . Since the Revolution of 1688 it had been the social center of London , and as late as 1860 it was still the custom for a great peer to devote at least one of his sons to the service of his country and the defense of his order in the House of Commons . . . . In the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near relatives of peers . " 2 This was the situation despite extensive electoral reforms , including the abolition in 1838 of the property qualification for membership in Parliament . Nevertheless , continues Professor Smellie , " aristocratic control tended to persist by reason . of the expense of elections and the importance of influence , cor- footnote 2 v ? i . V. , x.:370.  | rupt or social . " Bribery was not seriously restrained by legislation until 1854 , and not effectively until 1883 ; the secret ballot was not adopted until 1872 . Is an aristocracy of education a necessity in any form of government ? There seems to be some support for such a contention . Referring to the long-continued dominance of British politics by a social aristocracy , Professor Harold Laski has pointed out that if the British Labor party is to gain power and keep it , the number of leaders trained in constitutional law and practice must be notably increased . The leaders must know what needs to be done and how to do it , government being as intricate as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , much less the general public . American Politics Has Lacked Trained Intelligence Compared with Great Britain , political and legislative leadership in the United States has not drawn as successfully on the trained intellects of the country as it should . In many countries , political leadership is considered the highest calling to which the ambitious and capable can aspire . Our record is good but not as good as it should or needs to be . The crisis of the Revolutionary War called forth a group of leaders unexcelled in human history ? Washington , Jefferson , Franklin , Madison , Hamilton , Henry , and Adams ? to mention but a few . They came from all walks of life ? agriculture , law , publishing , and business but all had in common the fact that in the colonies they stood out because of their intellectual attainments , their moral fervor , and their devotion to the public welfare . The following period , from the first Congress up to the Civil War , saw the rise of legislative giants such as Daniel Webster , Calhoun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of stalwarts since then , with James G. Blaine , William Jennings Bryan , Robert M. La Follette , Sr. , George Norris , and others . The record has been admirable . But as we consider the staggering problems of the present and the future , we would be less than realistic if we failed to ask for more . Theodore Roosevelt , who loved the rough-and-tumble of politics , used to complain that American youth ' must be timid or effeminate , else larger numbers of the best would venture into leadership on behalf of the people . This criticism has often been heard . The highest qualified among our citizens shy away from politics . Why has a career in politics not been more popular in this country ? It is certainly not for lack of training . In the United States , democratic educational opportunities have been superior to those in Great Britain ; hence this can not be the determining factor . On the other hand , it is true that we do not have as long established a public service tradition , nor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes as in Great Britain ? although this difference has tended to diminish in recent years . The divergence of attitude in Great Britain and the United States stems barfly from the fact that ours has been a " huSln ( 'S11,111 S t ivilivatiMn " iii which  | large fortunes awaited the able and the aggressive . Business was filled with adventure and the same kind of struggle found in political life . Since opportunities in this field appeared before a tradition of a career in public service had been established , the American people naturally turned to business , and politics was neglected . In addition , until fairly recently , government has been considered a necessary evil . It was something to be endured rather than respected and ministered to by those best qualified for the job . It was the hope that if government was given a cold shoulder by the " best people , " it would somehow shrivel and subside . These same people have now learned that quite the reverse is true . Government interferes as much or more when ignored as when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility , the danger of minority control increases along with the loss of basic freedoms . The way to keep government within proper bounds is to nurture and attend it . Neglect leads only to more government of the wrong kind . Another factor is the problem of financing oneself in a political career if an assured income is lacking . Legislative salaries are not high , especially at the state level . Congressmen receive $10,000 a year . This is a fair-sized income , but it should be more . It does not begin to compare with salaries of from $50,000 to $1,500,000 which some businessmen , film producers , and financiers have earned . In this respect , however , a change has already set in . Taxes take so large a percentage of high incomes that they considerably narrow the disparity between public and private salaries . This economic factor , therefore , may make a marked difference in the financial aspect of the comparison . Furthermore , the indications are that the salaries of Congressmen will be increased in the near future . But what happens when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many a promising college senior has said , " I 'd like nothing better than to go into politics , but I have to earn a living . If I 'm a lawyer and am defeated , I can go back to , private practice ; if I 'm a businessman I can return to business ; or if I 'm a farmer I can retreat to the land . But how can I start young in politics and stay in it ? Wo n't I have to wait until I 've made my pile ? " Until the legislator is recognized for his true social worth and political parties have been able to afford careers to the promising , most individuals will have to assure themselves of other means of livelihood to fall back on . Nevertheless , as the United States has matured as a nation and the American people have come to place a more realistic evaluation on governing ability , politics as a lifetime career has become more common than formerly . But we still have a long way to go before political leadership is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks of life . WHO ARE THE LEGISLATORS ? A commonly suggested reason for the decline in the prestige of legislatures in Ame ! ie:nt life is that nowadays we do not have the forensic s'i:utis of the past-  | the Daniel Websters or the Henry Clays , let us say . A partial answer to this criticism is that formal oratory is not as prized as formerly . As we have seen , the real work of legislatures is accomplished in committee . By present-day standards , therefore , the fair question is , " How much statesmanship does Congressman Smith demonstrate in his consideration of legislation ? " There is much reliable testimony to show that American legislators today are better than the public apparently thinks they arc . The report on The Reorganization of Congress , for example , comments : " We have been most favorably impressed with the integrity and intelligence , the conscientiousness and courage , of the members of Congress with whom we have conferred in the course of our inquiry during the past four years . They compare very well indeed with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large legislative assembly , to be sure , has its quota of duds and dullards , of old gentlemen in their dotage , of windbags and time servers .... " The conclusion was that " regardless of statistical comparisons between the composition of Congress and the electorate ... our national legislature today is made up of substantial , conscientious , hard-working , well educated men and women who are better qualified for their great tasks than is sometimes supposed . " 3 So much propaganda has been aimed at belittling government that the actual facts might well be more favorable than the public appreciates . Additional light is thrown on this subject by Professor Lindsay Rogers in The American Senate . Professor Rogers has the reputation of being a caustic realist and hence his testimony is doubly significant . In his article on Congress in the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , he concludes that " in general , Congress adequately represents the country , that under strong Presidents who furnish real leadership it is complained of less frequently than under weak Presidents , and that on the average its collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average President . " 4 Formal Qualifications of Legislators Only at the federal and state levels of government are constitutional requirements set forth concerning members of the legislature . And even in these cases they are not extensive . The American people have deliberately sought a representative cross section of the population , not paragons of intellect and culture . Indeed , we have always preferred to elect legislators having the characteristics of the " common man , " rather than run the danger of encouraging class consciousness and snobbery . Article I of the federal Constitution deals with the qualifications of congressmen and senators . Age , citizenship , and residence are the only formal requirements : " No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty-five years , and been seven years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that State in 3 P. 82. 4 Vol . V , p. 365.  | which he shall be chosen . " In the case of senators , " No person shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of thirty years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States , and who shall not , when elected , be an inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen . " In both the House and the Senate , therefore , the language and the requirements are similar , with differences only as to age and length of citizenship . In addition , however , the Constitution specifically states that " no person holding any office under the United States shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office . " Moreover , the qualifications of members may be neither added to nor reduced save by constitutional amendment . Each house is the judge of contested election returns and the qualifications of its own members , and may expel members for cause on a two-thirds vote . Similar provisions are found in most of the states . In the states , the rules regarding qualifications are very simple . In most of them it is provided that any person qualified to vote for members of the state legislature may become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of twenty-one years is imposed , the top minimum being thirty years . As in the United States Senate , the members of some state senates must be ' older than candidates for the lower house . Early state constitutions often included religious or property qualifications , but as a result of the democratizing influence of the nineteenth century such requirements were dropped . The only other qualification commonly imposed today is an injunction against dual office holding , particularly the holding of federal in addition to state office . In city and local governments generally the only requirement common to most of them is that of residence . All council members must be residents of the city in which they serve . Large cities which use the ward or district system may also stipulate that candidates shall reside in the district in which they run , a requirement that reflects the geographical and single-member district emphases characteristic of American politics . The Upper Chamber ? Age as a Conservatizing Factor As previously noted , the upper house of the legislature has been traditionally regarded as the more conservative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged radical proclivities of the more numerous and popular assembly . Historically , since the time of Rome , it has been the stronghold of men of property and station . This is traditional also in Great Britain , where from the outset the House of Lords was the bulwark of the peerage and the higher clergy , even after the House of Commons grew in power and influence . But with the rise of the Labor party in Great Britain prominent members of that group , such as Sidney Webb , have been elevated to the peerage and tend to dilute its conservative exclusiveness . Today , therefore ? both in the United States and in Great Britain ? wealth and social position are not the dominating characteristic of upper chambers that they once were . Age , however , is still regarded as a eonscrvatiriug factor . It is assumed that  | experience makes men cautious , while inexperience tends to make them radical . Analyzing this aspect of the French Parliament , for example , Professor Roger Soltau has remarked that " while the minimum age limit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in fact a youthful complexion , the Senators must be at least forty years of age . This venerable body , composed of gens arrives , stands out in marked contrast to the Chamber , which under the Third Republic has drawn its membership from a constantly widening range of social classes and includes many of the upper working class . " 5 Yet , in Europe , as in Great Britain , the popular branch of the legislature is more powerful than the upper chamber . In the United States , the average age of both representatives and senators has tended to increase since the Civil War . From 1869 to 1871 , the average age of first-termers was 41 years , while in 1925 it was 47 and the upward trend has continued . In 1945 the average senator was 59 years old , compared with 43 years for the adult population of the country as a whole . This indicates that the adult population under 40 years is underrepresented in the Senate , while those over 40 years are overrepresented . This is also true in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average length of service in Congress was barely more than one term ; today it is two and a half terms . If a higher age is desirable for upper chambers , then why not raise the minimum age for the lower chamber as well ? Or is age desirable ? How much real correlation is there between age and experience , age and wisdom , age and statesmanship ? It might be argued that the older a man grows , the more he is likely to be influenced by a particular pressure group , and that in consequence he is less able to emphasize the interest of all . What would be the effect , for example , of electing a large number of returning war veterans ? between the ages of 25 and 30 , let us say ? to our legislatures ? Would they be more radical than older men ? Would they be more determined to discover what constitutes the public interest , or less so ? It is an interesting question . The Vocational Composition of Legislative Assemblies " Occupationally , " said the report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . is in no sense a mirror of the nation . " The so-called talking classes , especially lawyers , are overrepresented . Women are underrepresented , being one half of the population but having only 1.5 per cent of the membership of Congress in 1945.6 Labor , numerically the largest group in the population , had only one member . Minority parties , such as Socialist and Communist , had none , in striking contrast to many other countries , especially those in Europe . Congress is , and long has been , predominantly middle class . Its level of formal education , however , is considerably above that of the population as a whole . s Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , V , 376 . It is interesting to note that in 1945 , when French wonun were allowed for the first ' inn . to run for ofliec and to vote , 5 per cent of those elected to the l , iihameni were women .  | With regard to the skills represented by legislators , lawyers are the most numerous vocational group in Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal training and experience peculiarly fit a person to deal with legislation and to get himself elected to office . He has studied law , he has learned something about how the law should be made , he has argued his clients ' cases before juries ? all lessons which should teach him how to win votes . There seems to have been something of a cyclical tendency in the influence of lawyers in Congress . At the outset , when Congress was smaller , it included only 26 lawyers . Then they increased , and for a long time almost two thirds of the members were lawyers . But in 1945 they had dropped to 58 per cent of the membership . The trend seems to point to a decline in the proportion of lawyers and to a relative gain for other skill groups . A possible explanation will be offered later in the chapter . Other vocational groups in Congress in 1945 were represented in the following order : businessmen ( including contractors and manufacturers ) were second only to lawyers , with 56 members , constituting approximately 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third with 33 members or more than 6 per cent ; educators came next with 23 members or over 4 per cent ; the farming community followed with 16 , or 3 per cent . These were the five largest groups . There were also 9 bankers , 7 medical men , 3 dentists , 3 social workers , an architect , an engineer , a clergyman , and a housewife . In the state legislatures , although lawyers are in second place because farmers still constitute the largest single group , their influence is greater than even that of the farmers . Often they hold the top committee chairmanships . Because of their special training and aptitudes , they usually succeed in running things even when outnumbered . In other respects the vocational composition of state legislatures is similar to that of Congress , although these bodies are generally more representative of various economic segments of the population . Thus , for example , labor is fairly well represented in some state legislatures by its own members , whereas in Congress labor has had few spokesmen . In terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state or federal legislatures . Organized labor , for example , has taken an active interest in city politics . The Labor party in Great Britain grew from local government beginnings and it is possible that we are witnessing the early stages of a similar evolution in this country . Milwaukee , Bridgeport , and a few other American cities have had Socialist mayors . From the strength shown by the American Labor party in New York City we may perhaps expect more from that group at the national level than is now evident . The vocational complexion of the city council or county board depends on the dominant economic interest of the locality . In farming communities , farmers naturally run things pretty much their own way . In large cities the vocational groupings arc more diverse ? business and labor are prominent . But at the city ; Ind county level , as elsewhere , the legal fraternity enjoys much  | power , in influence if not always in numbers . Nevertheless , the role of the lawyer is considerably less prominent in local government than in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional and its present influence , however , the legal profession seems to be losing ground in American politics . Why is this ? Lawyers have a natural edge over other groups when it comes to political office seeking . In addition to other advantages mentioned above , the ability to return to private legal practice after a term or two in the legislature is an advantage . Besides , public recognition through service in the legislature has been found a good way of attracting clients , so that such an experience is an asset in the legal profession . is it possible that this is the explanation for the somewhat lowered influence of lawyers today ? To quote from the essay on the " Legal Profession and Legal Education " in the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences : " In the early history of the United States there was a tradition that lawyers were fit material for politics or statesmanship . They occupied a dominant ethical position analogous to that of clergymen and received a social recognition not given to the business classes . . . . With the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . . . leadership was shifted to the captains of industry and finance ; and the influential leaders of the bar became adjunct of this group rather than an independent influence . Traditions of public service , such as are found in the medical profession , insensibly disappeared ; the specialized learning of the lawyer was his private stock in trade to be exploited for his private benefit . This is roughly the position of the profession today . Intellectually the profession commanded and still commands respect , but it is the respect for an intellectual jobber and contractor rather than for a moral force . " ' This analysis throws additional light on the questions of pressure politics , legislative independence , and the quest for the public interest . If the legal profession is to continue its traditional influence in American legislatures and politics , then legal training must be less narrowly vocational . Rather , it must prepare men and women to understand and to deal with the most difficult economic , social , and governmental problems of the day . The law schools largely fail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume its former role , as described in the above quotation , so as to constitute a moral force serving the public interest rather than a skilled adjunct of special interests . It should also be noted that although a lawyer 's training and practice fit him for political leadership in most respects , there are several ways in which he is handicapped . Lawyers as a group are generally conservative , and hence likely to resist change and experimentation . In addition , they are contentious . They are trained to argue the merits of their client 's case irrespective of 7 IX , 344.  | whether they believe in it or not . In legal representation this is necessary , but is it a proper part of statesmanship , when that term is defined as the determination of policies benefiting the public as a whole ? Here some doubt arises . Sound public policy requires a broad view ? a blending of many diverse interests ? not the special pleading of a particular group . Furthermore , lawyers usually lack administrative experience . A sound law must be administratively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislators of how the executive branch of government operates , what difficulties are in the way of enforcement , how the human aspects of organization and personnel must be fused to make the program successful . Unfortunately , legal training is deficient in the field of administrative experience and understanding . Not only do law curriculums generally neglect problems of public administration , but few lawyers are able to secure administrative experience after they begin their professional careers . This aspect of the matter , however , might be corrected ? and politics made more attractive ? if those entering it could look forward to administrative service at times when elective office is not open to them . The problem of having something to fall back on and the question of staying indefinitely in the government service would then be solved . Such an interchange has the further advantage that it would be beneficial to both the legislative and the administrative bodies themselves . The fact that the latter would acquire a better sense of public relations and responsiveness would lessen the evils of bureaucracy , while the legislators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , careerists in government may look forward to both kinds of service so that it is possible to remain in government for a lifetime . In Great Britain , for example , rising political leaders customarily undertake tours of duty in administrative departments , followed by full-time membership in Parliament . Switzerland , as Professors Carl J. Friedrich and Taylor Cole have pointed out in Responsible Bureaucracy , is outstandingly successful in the use of this kind of interchangeability , and so also is Sweden . When a promising man fails to be re-elected , why should not public administration be an alternative to private legal practice ? It is a suggestion worth considering and will be discussed again in the study of public administration later in the book.8 One thing seems clear : if the legal profession is to serve the government as brilliantly as it once did , the lawyers of the morrow must learn more of the problems of public administration than they have in the past . THE SINGLE-MEMBER DISTRICT AS A DETERRENT TO LEGISLATIVE OFFICE The single-member district system , combined with the requirement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is the fact that it Sec Chapter 3 ' 1 , " Administration as a Career . "  | discourages those who wish to enter government as a lifework . A candidate must be elected from his residence or he can not be elected at all . But if he were allowed to run for office wherever a majority of voters favor him , his prospects would not be so limited . The House of Representatives and our state legislatures have suffered because of the essentially local basis of representation . It is hard to emphasize the general national interest when one is elected to reflect the parochial interest . The Constitution stipulates that a representative must be an inhabitant of the state from which he is chosen . It does not say that a resident in one Congressional district may not run for office in another , so long as it is in the same state . But rarely has local residence , as an additional requirement , been relaxed in practice . By long-continued custom the idea has grown up that the local residence requirement is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of such constitutional or customary requirements has strengthened party responsibility and leadership and has tended to safeguard the country against a too intense localism . The level of ability in the House of Commons has benefited in consequence . After consultation with his party leaders , a man running for the House of Commons may " stand " in any district he chooses . If there is a surplus of able candidates in one district and a dearth in another , the imbalance can be corrected . This freedom has contributed greatly to making politics in Great Britain the highest ambition of the ablest university graduates . Drawbacks of the Single-Member Election System The basic objections to the parochial system of electing legislators are important enough to be repeated . First , it limits career opportunities . In addition , it forces the legislator to lower his sights by keeping them on his own area ? he must spend a large part of his time keeping his political fences in repair . " Living in the shadow of his constituency , " says Lindsay Rogers , " he can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in his district . " If he does not go along when the farm lobby cracks down , for example , he may face political oblivion . The single-member district system also creates unduly large legislative assemblies because rather than redistrict ? entailing a possible reduction of membership ? legislators demand new districts , which means a larger membership . At the state and local levels this practice often means election districts that are too small , thus restricting leadership potentialities . Another result is flagrant inequalities in representation . If the United States Senate were recruited on the basis of population , for example , with no state having less than two senators , New York , in comparison to Nevada , would he entitled to 270 . The single-member system also leads to gerrymandering and fails to do justice to centers of concentrated population , as in the cities . And finally , it militates against majority rule . Even if discouragement to lcgi'slativc careers were the only consequence , localism would still he a serious matter . But  | with so many important issues at stake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a major problem of American government . A Summary of Possible Solutions There must be solutions to the problems created by the use of the singlemember district system . What are they and which ones could be combined to produce a happier situation ? General ticket system . An earlier chapter suggested combining the singlemember and general ticket systems , making some legislative positions elective by districts and putting others on a city-wide or state-wide basis . There are three principal objections to such a plan . For one thing , the voters demand that a candidate be peculiarly their " own . " In addition , candidates can not easily cover wide areas , such as a whole state , although this is not a particularly valid objection because senators and congressmen at large find it possible to do so . And finally , populous centers such as the large cities are likely to have a disproportionately heavy influence compared with the rest of the state . Limited voting . This is a system by which the voter may register his choice for only a certain number of candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seats to be filled . The voter may cast all of his votes for one candidate or for several candidates as desired , and party leaders usually advise their supporters how to concentrate their votes to the best advantage . The scheme is designed to encourage minority representation and to emphasize discrimination in voting . Cumulative voting . In this case , the voter has as many votes as there are places to be filled , but he may cast all of them for one candidate ( hence cumulative ) , or he may distribute them among two or more candidates as he pleases . This plan has been used particularly in Illinois , where members of the lower house of the state legislature are elected by this method . It is sometimes called the " plumping " system . It resembles limited voting , but more votes are available . Proportional representation . PR is the system best designed to encourage an accurate representation of the electorate because it widens the area of choice , gives minority groups their share , and provides for transferable surpluses of votes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main alternatives to the single-member district system which exist in the United States today . Does any one of them eliminate parochialism ? The general ticket system probably comes nearest to doing so . Other combinations are in use and in some cases have proved useful , but no system alone , apparently , meets all the necessary requirements . This summary suggests another possibility : to relax the local residence tradition and permit outsiders to run for election . Nothing stands in the way of this reform so long as the candidate is a resident of the state in which the district  | for which he runs is located , but tradition has so obscured this fact that such a reform would probably have to be effected by law . TENURE AND SALARY Most able people dislike to interrupt a busy life to run for public office , but many who now hold back would probably come forward if they could anticipate a longer term of service . The length of tenure in legislative assemblies and the possibilities of re-election , therefore , are elements to be considered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts ? The longest tenure provided for in the nation is the six-year term of the United States senator . One third of the members of the Senate come up for election every two years ( staggered terms ) , in consequence of which there is a two-thirds turnover during a single presidential term . Members of the House of Representatives , on the other hand , are elected for only two years . The fact that senators serve three times as long as representatives doubtless helps to explain the relatively greater influence of the former . At present , salaries for congressmen are set at $10,000 a year , plus additional allowances for travel . The chances are that these will be increased , however , and that they may reach as high as $20,000 a year . In the state legislatures the usual tenure for members of the lower house is two years , although in some it is four and in New Jersey it is one . In state senates the usual term is four years , although in some it is two , and in New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be remembered that in most cases they convene only once in two years . The exceptions are New Jersey , New York , Rhode Island , and South Carolina , where the sessions are annual . In addition , most state legislatures meet for a short period only ? averaging perhaps not more than three months . A career as state legislator , therefore , can more easily be combined with a private occupation than can a career in Congress . The salaries of state legislators average about $10 a day during the session , plus allowances for travel , postage , and the like . The members of city councils and county boards usually serve either two- or fouryear terms , with a trend toward the longer period . In this field if a salary is attached to the office it is a nominal one . For more than a century there has been a tendency to increase the length of legislative service . The original state constitutions usually provided for annual elections , but it was soon recognized that terms should be longer , and hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressmen . In local government the same trend has occurred . Has not the time now arrived when our whole electoral system should be revised , making the fouryear term the rule instead of the exception ? The arguments in favor of longer terms are compelling . They would encourage legislative leadership as a career ; they would lessen the expense incurred by candidates and the public , which must pay for elections ; and a four-year terns would mal:c it financially feasible for men to run for office who now feel  | they can not afford the cost for so brief a reward . Another argument is that a term of one or two years is hardly long enough to learn the legislative ropes . Legislators do not become valuable nor can they really be tested in so short a time . We would not think of limiting our business or professional leadership to one- or two-year terms in office . An additional factor is that with longer terms of office , members might be more independent of local and interest group pressures , to the advantage of the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home and more on matters of broader import . Of all the arguments for lengthening the terms of legislators , however , perhaps the most important is that legislative and executive terms could then be made to synchronize . Responsible government , as an earlier chapter noted , is an essential aspect of good government . When members of the legislature are elected in the middle of the four-year term of the executive ( the off-year elections ) , a disastrous stalemate may occur if control of the legislature is captured by one party while control of the executive branch is retained by the other . Public affairs are so vital that government by obstruction can not be tolerated . And yet this is just what occurred in the middle of the Taft and the Hoover administrations , and in the middle of the second Wilson term . In state governments , also , it has become a constantly perplexing problem . On the grounds of both efficiency and responsibility , therefore , the American people should take steps to prevent the occurrence of this stalemate . Synchronized terms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these arguments in favor of longer terms of office is the greater responsiveness to the public which comes from more frequent elections . Also , if the voters make a mistake in the choice of a particular lawmaker , they can more quickly rectify it under the short-term system . But are these two arguments sufficient to overcome the opposing points ? If members of the legislatures were elected for longer terms , as voters we might be more attentive to our civic obligations and prove more discriminating in the use of the ballot . Length of Service That politics has increasingly become a career in the United States is evidenced by the average length of service of our legislators . This trend can be seen at all levels , but the following statistics relate chiefly to Congress . In 1941 , Senator Norris , whose biography linked his name with the word " integrity , " had served continuously for 29 years . Representative Sabath of Illinois , chairman of the powerful Rules Committee in the House , had been returned to office for a total of 35 consecutive years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen 33 years of continual service in the Senate . In the House , li members in addition to Representative Sabath , had served 30 years or more . Generally speaking , long service is more common in the House than in the Senate , despite the shorter term ; the size of the body is larger and the area of the constituency smaller . In the Seventieth Congress , out of a total of 4i5  | members in the House , only 53 were newcomers . A striking revelation , this ! We are so close to the picture that we hardly realize how rapidly careerism in public office is catching hold in the United States . In the Sixty-ninth Congress , on the other hand , one half of the senators were serving their first term . SHOULD LEGISLATORS BE MERELY JUDGES ? We come now to an important point . Can the prestige of legislators be restored to its former place in the people 's esteem ? This must be brought about if representative government is to endure , because if prestige is lacking it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career in public office . It is they alone who can provide the leadership that we so badly need . Have the preceding chapters on the lawmaking process assumed more for legislative influence and control than we can look for or even hope for ? These chapters have said that the legislature is the center of political gravity , or ought to be . Is that statement wrong ? Some thoughtful people are convinced that the executive should formulate all legislative programs and that legislatures should then merely discuss , revise , and approve them . It is argued that legislatures should not attempt to initiate the grand legislative strategy of society . Others go even further and say that under modern conditions , where definite and prompt action is indispensable , legislatures should be little more than stage setting . " The legislator , " says Harvey Walker in his Law-Making in the United States , " needs only to act in a judicial capacity . " Professor Walker is not one of those who would have legislatures abdicate . On the contrary . But he apparently realizes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pressure groups and the executive branch . He argues that the power of pressure groups and lobbies ? added to or working with the administrative departments of the government  - -  accounts for the major part of bill drafting and policy initiation . Professor Walker concludes , therefore , that the function of the legislator might as well fall in with this tendency . The legislator would weigh in the balance the arguments pro and con , as presented in briefs and evidence prepared by the research departments of lobbies and administrative departments . Then " if he deems that the public 's interests have not been adequately represented , " says he , " he may turn to a legislative reference bureau which will prepare for him a brief on the subject . " Without wishing to disparage the important function of the judge , we may well ask if this is all that may be expected of American legislative assemblies in the future . Woodrow Wilson was perhaps nearer to political wisdom when he said that legislative assemblies are of necessity , in a free government , the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status it is the work of political science to see that they redeem it . It will be a good omen for America 's future when promising men and women in our colleges say as confidently as they now do of business or professional careers , " I expect to go into politics . "  | THE CENTER OF POWER : PARTY LEADERS Legislators have influence , but party leaders have even more . Party leadership , therefore , should increasingly become the ambition of those who have had the best educational opportunities . This , however , will take time . Party leaders do not enjoy great prestige in America today . Rather , they are linked in the public mind with boss rule , spoils , shady practices , graft , and corruption . This is particularly true of the local boss , but even state and national party chieftains lack the public prestige to which their power and influence should properly entitle them . Here is where Theodore Roosevelt 's counsel applies most strikingly : If a man has good red blood in his veins and is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess an irresistible appeal . The political party , as noted before , not only controls the election laws and the choice of candidates ; it also directs or should direct the course of public policy . Some men are " born politicians . " They like people , they understand human motivation , and they like to lead . They can engage in intrigue and manipulation without losing their integrity and their ideals . These are the political leaders that America needs . The political type , at its best , represents an ideal that is hard to surpass . Read , for example , some of the biographies mentioned at the end of this chapter . The politician is tolerant and understanding . He loves people ? the unwashed as well as the well scrubbed ? or he could have no influence with them . Behind his seemingly calloused exterior there is often a warm heart filled with compassion for his fellows . The trouble with many such leaders is that politics to them is only a game , played for the interests that pay them and keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the position they occupy in the structure and functioning of society . They are not " self-conscious . " If the qualities of old-time politicians could be combined with a rugged idealism , and integrity ? such as that of George Norris or Robert Wagner , let us say ? the desired blend would be effected . Politics is and always has been among the highest arts which man may acquire . The question now is , will the challenge be heeded ? SUPPLEMENTARY READING 1 .

There is a question , therefore , of which field should be dealt with first , public administration , or the scope of judicial institutions and procedures . There are arguments for either sequence . In the governmental process , administration follows legislation ; on the other hand , the influence of the courts is a major factor in the drafting of the law . Indeed , the control of the judiciary over the shaping of public policy is greater in the United States than in any other country in the world . This is another of the so-called distinctive features of the American system of government . These are compelling reasons for dealing first with the judiciary , and this is the course which will be followed here . Following the present chapter on law and legal institutions , the discussion turns next to the judiciary as policy maker , to judicial administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the judicial office as a career : Law is one of those words in the social science vocabulary which is susceptible of many definitions . In that respect it is like such terms as " state , " " sovereignty , " and " democracy . " Indeed , it would not he hard to collect a hundred or more definitions of law . Aristotle , for example , defined law as " whatsoever the ruling part of the state shall enact . " To Hobbes , law was the command of the sovereign . T. E. Holland , in Elements of Jurisprudence , held law to be " a general rule of external human action enforced by a sovereign political authority . " J. C. Carter , in Law : Its Origin , Growth , and Function , says , " Law always has been , still is , and will forever continue to be custom . " A. V. Dicey , on the other hand , holds law to be simply the aggregate of rules ? including statute law , constitutional law , and custom ? enforced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps one of the best definitions of law is that of Woodrow Wilson , who believed law to be " the will of a state concerning the civic conduct of those under its authority . This will may be more or less formally expressed ; it may speak either in custom or in specific enactment . . . . Law is that portion of the established thought and habit which has found a distinct and formal recognition in the shape of uniform rules backed by the authority and power of the government . " 1 f Woodrow Wilson , The State ( New York , rev. rd. , 1898 ) , p. 587 . For discussion , see F. M. ti. it , Political Inrtuwionr ( New York , 1 ' 938 ) , pp. 158 ( 1 .  | Generally speaking , definitions of law may be divided into two main groups . First there are those of the analytical school , which emphasizes authority and compulsion in accordance with the formal rules of society . Second , there are those of the historical school , which emphasizes rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine these two elements because law is both . It will not be far wrong , therefore , to say that law consists of that body of written and unwritten rules of human conduct which are enforced in society by express or customary sanction . It is important to note , however , that while law covers all of society , it has a special relation to government . Thus law is that element found in all three branches of the government which sanctions and enforces the customs and formal rules of society as they apply to individuals and groups , including the government itself . We can not think of government without thinking also of law . Law to government is like the circulatory system to the human body . The legislature makes it , the executive enforces it , the judiciary interprets it , the constitution contains some of its formal provisions , and society itself makes and changes it through custom , interpretation , public opinion , criticism , and advocacy . Law , like politics , reflects the differences in economic systems in various parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be primitive or complicated , individualistic or collectivistic , democratic or autocratic . In all systems , however , there is always one thing in common ? law is the means through which groups seek influence , governments secure control and compliance , and individuals look for protection . Law , therefore , becomes a central concern , because law and government are interchangeable . If government is to keep pace with the problems of society , it must be through law . This chapter takes up the rise of legal institutions , the form of law , and the differences between . the civil and the common law . It concludes with a discussion of the content of law , including public , private , and criminal law . THE RISE OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS In his article on law in the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , Professor A. R. Radcliffe-Brown defines law as " social control through the systematic application of the force of politically organized society . " But in connection with this he makes the rather surprising statement that " in this sense , some simple societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by sanctions . " But is custom not law ? In the broad sense in which law has been defined here , it is . No definition can change the fact that law , as an instrument of government , grew out of custom and depends in large measure on custom today . Legislation sometimes changes custom , but more often it merely reinforces the values and concepts which , through custom , predominate in society . Through the coercive power of the police and the courts , government sometimes ion In eserci.se compulsion , but i1 any political organization attempted  | to rely on compulsion alone ? ignoring the aid of custom ? that regime would not long endure . Custom and compulsion go hand in hand . The simpler the society , the more of customary sanction there is likely to be ; the more complex the society , the more of formal governmental sanction we may expect . In a complex society , written codes of law are likely to be more in evidence ; legislation becomes an important factor ; an elaborate court structure comes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other fields . Custom arises , as Carter has pointed out , through the interplay of men and their environment . Men adjust themselves and respond to the stimuli of their surroundings . Survival , convenience , and other factors cause them to form habits . An implicitly acknowledged attitude grows up with regard to the rightness or wrongness , the fitness or inappropriateness of particular actions . In a simple community , public opinion is usually the only sanction needed to enforce conformity to basic understandings and taboos . Working with public opinion , however , pressures of other kinds come to be exerted . One of these is economic . Property rights , for example , were early emphasized in primitive societies and continue to be emphasized today . Sex and family life are central among the interests of the individual and are among the first to be protected . Together with other pressures that appear as the community matures , these are the materials out of which law is gradually compounded . The manner in which law originated and grew should help us to understand it today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or nothing to do with it . Government was not needed ; the family and religious organization took care of the simple needs of the community and were the two principal institutions influencing custom , which at length became recognized as law in the formal sense . The settlement of disputes between individuals was a private matter . In both Rome and England various methods of self-help were used . If two men quarreled over the ownership of a horse , for example , they fought it out and the stronger took the horse . However , if it became noised about that he was not entitled to the animal , he might find it uncomfortable to remain in the community . As family control in a simple society gives way to the rule of a recognized political chieftain whose influence is clue largely to the need for common defense , the community begins to interfere increasingly in private disputes . The chieftain is consulted as to what the customary rule is on a given point . He is appealed to when the loser fails to carry out his agree.nent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eventually public opinion decides that it would be a good idea if the community made the rules and required individuals to follow set procedures in certain groups of cases . All of this takes time and develops gradually . There is no set pattern for all cultures , but there are a good many similarities . Legislation comes relatively late in this process . At first it is rare and usually takes the form of edicts from the kint , or ruler , rather than laws emanating  | from a legislature . Later , however , the legislature assumes control and thereafter becomes the chief source of law . In Athens , the influence of the citizen assembly was so great that legislation became prominent in the Greek city-state long before it did , relatively speaking , in Rome or England . In Rome the legislature never reached its full stature because the executive always remained the stronger of the two branches of the government . In England , on the other hand , the evolution was completed by 1688 , when Parliamentary supremacy was established . Adjudication Grows Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world today are derived from either Roman or English origins . There are many resemblances between them , however , in their early development , due in part to Roman occupation of the British Isles , although the origins of English law antedate this occupation . In both instances , law evolved out of custom into a governmental responsibility . Both systems relied on self-help methods . Both made use of ritualistic formalities such as the " laying on of the hand " to denote ownership ? the religious influence . Both developed fastest under social pressure from a dissatisfied class of citizens who insisted on formal agreements , on rights expressly written down , and on administrative machinery to hear controversies where the stronger attempted to impose on the weaker . Both evolved their courts and primitive judicial machinery from the administrative offices of the realm . In Rome , the governor of a colony was called a praetor . He was an administrative official , the chief executive of a province . When a dispute arose it was his responsibility to determine what law applied . Should it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) us gentium ) of the conquered country ? Rome wisely decided to recognize the latter wherever possible , realizing that local custom is stubborn and should not be interfered with unless clearly necessary . At length the praetor became so busy with his administrative duties that he could no longer hear all the disputes coming before him . He needed an assistant , a hearing officer . This official was called a " judex , " the root of our word " judge . " Over a period of time , as the volume of work increased , the praetor had increasingly less to do with judicial matters . The judex not only heard cases but used his own judgment in applying the law to them . In general outline this is the manner in which the English judicial institutions also evolved . The Lord High Chancellor ? member of the king 's household and responsible for legal matters ? became so overworked with the affairs of state that delegations of authority were necessary . The division of labor and specialization of function grew increasingly essential . The king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities through the sheriff , the justice of the peace , and eventually the county courts . At first , of course , there were no formal courts as we know them today . These evolved into their present form just as legislation , a rival of custom , developed over a period of time .  | The fight for judicial independence in England and for the rule of law was part of the people 's contest with the king for Parliamentary supremacy . It gathered force in the latter part of the sixteenth century and came to a head in the seventeenth . By 1688 the judiciary was secure from royal domination , just as Parliament was secure . There would be no more Star Chamber proceedings by means of which the king applied his own law in his own courts for his own purposes . The right of trial by jury and indictment by grand jury had been fought for and won . The " rule of law " had become an essential part of the English constitution . As Coke and Blackstone explained it , the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or low , governmental or private , rich or poor , was above the law and immune from the courts ; second , that there was only one body of law ? the common law ? for all classes and cases . THE FORM OF LAW : CODIFICATION VS . PRECEDENT The civil law , derived from Rome , is codified . It is written down in codes by main classes of subject matter , with principles applicable to every field of dispute or question . All that the public , the lawyers , and the judges have to do , therefore , is consult the code as they would a handbook . Anglo-American law , on the other hand , is not primarily codified , although steps in that direction have been taken in recent years . Rather , it is based on common law and on precedents made up from the so-called leading cases which the judges are supposed to follow when a similar controversy arises . These are the main differences in form between the civil law as derived from Rome and the common law which grew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the dangers of overemphasis on the differences and of failure to recognize the similarities . The civil law , for example , also makes use of precedents , and this tendency has increased in recent years , just as gradual codification is taking place in Anglo-American law . Both systems of law rely heavily also on custom and legislation . Thus , although there is an important difference in form in each case , the sources evidence much in common . Roman law got its impulse in the direction of codification as early as the Twelve Tables ( 451 ? 449 B.c . ) . This writing down of the law on stone tablets was primarily due to the plebeians who , in their long struggle with the patricians , wanted to secure their property rights , the right of intermarriage with patricians , and the right to be admitted to the highest legislative and executive offices of the state . In the Twelve Tables they did not get everything they demanded but they got a start , and so did codification . The work of Roman law codification was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the famous codification of the Emperor Justinian . By that time the barbarians had invaded from the north , Rome had fallen , and Justinian ruled over the Eastern Empire at Constantinople . But before Roman government faded out of the picture she left a Corpus Juris Civilis , in four parts , which formed the basis for the growth of the civil law in European and other countries . France became the chief transmitter of the influences of Roman law , which according  | to Professor J. Declareuil , " was nowhere more completely naturalized than in France . " In England , a separate and less formal body of law , the common law , had grown up . It was never codified . But as the influence of Roman law was diffused , the common law became a notable beneficiary , especially in the fields of wills , estates , corporation law , admiralty , equity , and family relations . The common law was also supplemented by the canon law , developed by churchmen in the Middle Ages . At first the canon law applied only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church spread in secular and temporal matters , the influence of the canon law also became diffused . Influence of the Jurists The student of law has played an outstanding part in the growth of both civil and common law , although his influence is greater in the Roman than in the English field . The codification of Justinian could not have been accomplished without the work of centuries of systematization and commentary by legal scholars . Cicero , one of the first of these , emphasized the Stoic idea of equality before the law , justice arising from natural law , and the law of peoples ( jus gentium ) which has been so influential in the development of the natural law tradition during the eighteenth century and the growth of international law in more recent times . The English common law system was established as early as the thirteenth century , but a later period of growth was due to the work of commentators . Coke was one of these . Blackstone ( 1723 ? 1780 ) , who wrote his Commentaries around 1765 , was the greatest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English law . In this country , Kent ( 1763 ? 1847 ) and Story ( 1779 ? 1845 ) are the principal legal authorities deserving of notice . THE CIVIL LAW AND THE COMMON LAW Each people has had its own law because each has had its own customs . There is Egyptian , Jewish , Greek , Chinese , Islamic , Japanese , or Hindu law , to mention some of the older bodies of that discipline , but it is the Roman and the English bodies of law which have had the greatest influence in terms of the diffusion of their concepts in other countries . Most of the world is divided between them today . The common law system which grew up in England is now found in England and Ireland ; in the United States except Louisiana ; in Puerto Rico ; in the Philippines ; in Canada except Quebec ; in Australia ; in New Zealand ; in India with certain exceptions ; and in the British colonies other than those settled originally by the French or the Dutch . For the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . The civil law of Rome covers an even greater extent of the earth 's surface than the English common law . Generally speaking , the ambit of the civil law includes the European countries which were once part of the ancient and  | medieval Roman empires , along with their past and present colonies . The civil law also spread to Russia but has been greatly modified there since 1917 . It claims Scotland , Louisiana , and Quebec ; it forms the basis of the legal system of South Africa ; it has even influenced the revised legal codes of Turkey and Japan . The civil law is also the legal system of South and Central America , including Mexico . With the exception , therefore , of parts of Africa , the Mohammedan Near East , China , and Japan , the civil law of Rome and the common law of England have overrun most of the world . In those parts of Asia which have been mentioned , the peoples have their own systems , although japan has borrowed much from the civil law . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , but actually they have been molded and remolded by every nation that has come in touch with them . In the diffusion of the Roman and the English bodies of law , the distinctive customs and formal rules of a people have combined with them to form a new blend in each case , consisting of both the indigenous and the borrowed . As a result , there are many differences of doctrine and procedure within both great legal systems . For example , the common law of the United States branched off from that of England in the first part of the seventeenth century ; whereafter important modifications began to be made and are still in process . During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries farreaching changes also occurred in the law of England itself , as interpreted by English courts and established by Parliament . Thus today there are notable differences between the English and the American bodies of law , although we give the combined legal system the shorthand title of Anglo-American law . The sources of our common law in the United States are listed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions and English books of authority prior to colonization and , second , English statutes prior to colonization and in the intervening period before the Revolution . He also mentions the law merchant , or the universal custom of the commercial world which was absorbed by both the common ( English ) and the civil ( continental ) law . Then there are the canon law developed by the church , and international law , the law of war and peace among civilized nations , which became a part of the common law . And finally , there are customs ? to which might be added the basic documents of freedom such as Magna Carta , the Petition of Right , and the Bill of Rights . Some of the more important differences between the English common and the continental civil law may now be listed : In the development of the common law , the influence of the judges has been greater than any other , because of the extent to which the common law relies on precedent . In civil law , the influence of the jurist or commentator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the codifications possible . tirr Ins articlr rntitlrrl " Common T.iw " in tic Farti ? rIof'cILr of the Snrill . Giraree , IT , 50-56.  | Next to Justinian 's codification , that of Napoleon , which appeared in 1804 , has had the most influence in civil law countries because it constituted a finished product on which others could draw . The main parts of Napoleon 's code deal with civil law , 3 procedure , commerce , criminal procedure , and forestry . Work is now in process on labor and rural codifications . Codifications are brought into being by legislation ; hence legislation constitutes an important source of the civil law . The common law , on the other hand , is primarily judge-made law , which today , however , must be combined with statutory law . Nevertheless , as Dean Pound and others have pointed out , because of their tradition , judges tend to prefer common law to statute law . Consequently in their interpretations they unconsciously think of statute law in terms of common law doctrines ; this proclivity has had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Legislation is as important a source of law in Anglo-American countries as in civil law countries , but because of the precedent nature of our common law and its generally noncodified form , judges have a greater influence here in interpreting legislation . Another difference between the civil and the common law is that in civil law countries , the judge dominates the proceedings and often interrogates witnesses , whereas in Anglo-American countries , attorneys perform this function . Our method of court procedure has been characterized as the method of the cockfight , the civil law method as the inquisition . In our procedure the attorneys fight it out , using legal technicalities , impassioned appeals , or other means designed to secure a favorable decision . In civil law countries the parties are represented by counsel , but the judge himself tries to bring out the pertinent issues and facts as expeditiously as possible , asking questions and restraining counsel when necessary . It is interesting to note that this same tendency on the part of judges has increased in the United States . Judges in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask questions from the bench . In civil law countries , cases are heard in collegium ? that is , by three or more justices sitting on the same case ; Anglo-American countries have the singlejudge tradition . But here again , the difference tends to disappear , and it is increasingly customary in both the state and the federal courts of the United States to have several judges , rather than one , on the bench . In civil law countries , a formal distinction is made in the codes between private and public law . But in common law countries no such formal division is made . In common law countries , therefore , the difference between public and private law is found only in classifications used for teaching and research purposes . footnote a It will be seen that the term " civil law " is used in two senses . The first is a comprehensive sense to denote the law of Rome and the countries adopting her jurisprudence . The second distinguishes civil cases from others , notably criminal cases . This dual usage is so old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two principal subdivisions of public law are constitutional and administrative law . As Frank J. Goodnow once said , constitutional law deals with the anatomy of government , administrative law with its physiology . Constitutional law relates to the general powers and organization of government , while administrative law deals with the powers and organizational procedures of those who administer . Administrative law is law in action.4 THE CONTENT OF LAW The classification of law in the United States includes public , private , and criminal law . The government sanctions all three kinds . Public law regulates the organization of government , the powers and duties of its departments and officers , and its relations with individuals . Public law depends almost entirely on the formal provisions of constitutions and legislative statutes . Private law may be most simply defined as that body of rules and principles which regulates the relations of individuals with each other . Private law , in common law countries , is a combination of ruling case law and statutes .

A legal fiction is something assumed for legal purposes , whereas in fact it may be something quite different . The assumption that a corporation is a " person " is a legal fiction . The public and criminal law sections of the civil law have been substantially modified by the form of government in each country . This is less apparent in the case of private law , but even here there is a tendency for the demarcation line between public and private law to fade . In an article on civil law , for example , Professor J. Declareuil tells us , " Indeed , the civil law is undergoing a marked transformation in the direction of socialization . Civil law in the sense of private law is in danger of disappearing . Private legal transactions , because of their socialization , are on the verge of being absorbed into public law . " j This may be an overstatement , but there can be no question that such a tendency exists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A generation ago Dean Pound pointed out that business and labor relations had become the concern largely of administrative tribunals outside the regular court structure , with the result that the base of the common law was constantly narrowing . With the adoption of codes of fair competition , trade association agreements , collective bargaining agreements , and the like , the line separating private and public law tends more than ever to shrink . a Dealt with in Chapter 38 , " Holding Administration Accountable . " 5 Article on " Civil Law , " Encyclopedia of the Social Scicnccs , II , 508.  | The Criminal Law In the field of criminal law , crimes such as murder have apparently always been a matter of concern to the commonweal , even among preliterate peoples . There is a striking uniformity in all ages and countries in the offenses considered proper subjects of criminal law ? with murder , robbery , and burglary among the first . Since the Industrial Revolution the number of criminal offenses has grown with the addition of petty crimes of the acquisitive type.6 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special commissions were set up to investigate individual offenses . From Rome , in the later development of Roman law , came two basic principles that have been generally followed throughout the Western world : first , every crime must be defined in advance by legislation ; and second , the enforcement and prosecution of the criminal law are the responsibility of the state itself . In England , criminal law was based on the legal conception of the king 's peace , by means of which both the private and the criminal law were extended . Main thoroughfares , for example , could be designated the king 's road and any offense committed on them against the body or property of an individual was an offense against the king himself . There are two main categories in criminal law . The first is felonies , usually involving a penitentiary sentence of a year or more ; the second is misdemeanors , involving a shorter jail term or a fine . In order to protect society against harsh and undefined punishments ? which were common as late as the early nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty , involving the predefinition of the crime and the establishment of proof . This is perhaps the major principle in criminal procedure . Due process of law and individualization of treatment are also primary principles of justice in this field . Substantive Content of Law If the body of law at any period of time or in any country is examined , it will be found that the largest part of it deals with property rights . This is natural . To the primitive person his canoe , bow and arrow , his coconut tree , and his shack were virtually all he owned . They meant prestige and influence in the community as well as security . In the life of today , property is a much more complex conception , and the categories of law dealing with it have expanded accordingly . Most of the early law of Rome dealt with property . The patricians and plebeians were both concerned that it should ? the patricians in order to insure their privileged position , the plebeians to safeguard what they had and to lay the foundation for securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land and chattels , by a fiction , were considered to inhere in their owner . The law of contract " Sr , t'h.il , trr S1. " 1'lu ( : nunninit ' Safrh ' : urJ Sr , cial 1'm'irnn111r11t.  | was early emphasized , as it is today . An obligatio ( obligation or contract ) was a binding agreement between two persons , but it was not long before it came to be viewed as a res ( thing ) ? something with a separate identity and having an existence distinct from the parties to it . These two illustrations show how the law , largely by means of fictions , grows and develops over a period of time . Another example of a fiction of law is the corporate organization . The corporation was first used by the Romans prior to the birth of Christ . It was a subsidiary private group chartered by the state for a particular purpose ? almost any kind of purpose including business , education , religion , municipal government , the guild , and so on . Under the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a fictitious person with a separate personality , identity , property , perpetuity , and similar characteristics apart from the individuals who actually formed and constituted it . The significance of any such doctrine is obvious . The manner in which the Supreme Court of the United States , making use of this fiction , applied the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the business corporation has been described . How can something that is based on a fiction , something that is not real , be regulated and held to accountability ? This is an example of the difficulties arising in the realms of law and administration . The number of doctrinal differences in the common and civil law systems is not particularly great . In a few cases , however , the differences give rise to misunderstandings ? even to international incidents . A notable case of this kind arose in the long-protracted dispute between United States and Mexican interests over the expropriation of American oil properties in Mexico by the Mexican government . It started in 1920 and lasted for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsurface title to minerals , and other elements such as petroleum , shall vest in the government and can not be alienated ; persons and companies may merely be licensed to exploit them at a rental fee . But our common law , being more individualistic in this respect , provides that subsurface rights may be owned outright in perpetuity by the owner of the land above . In Mexico the two concepts came into conflict . The question of which is the better rule depends on one 's view of basic economic and social policies . Fortunately the number of such areas of disagreement is not large . IMPORTANCE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL MACHINERY If the law can keep pace with human needs and desires , the role of government will be much easier . People will then be content and at ease , rather than dangerously tense in the face of obsolete restrictions . If equal justice can be done in every case , the people will respect their officials and will be more fairminded themselves .

James Mill , in his essay entitled " Gove " rnment , " observes that " the executive functions of government consist of two parts , the administrative and the judicial . " Basically , therefore , governIhent has but two aspects : the making of policy and the execution of policy . The doctrine of the separation of powers to the contrary , each of the three branches of government shares in both processes . Thus the legislature regards administrative surveillance and control as one of its primary duties . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as will be noted later , even relieves the courts of substantial areas of quasi-judicial work . This is especially true in the numerous fields of public control represented by such agencies as the Interstate Commerce Commission or state workmen 's compensation commissions . For their part , the courts assist in the administration of the law , deciding disputes as they arise in the course of enforcement . They also exercise a strong influence on the legislature through their powers of interpretation and judicial review . There is a distinction between the judicial interpretation of the law and the judicial review of legislation . In the case of interpretation , the courtslarifies the meaning of the law But in the case of review , the court must decide whether there was an authority to sass the law in the first place . Between interpretation and review there is a practical re ation which has been emphasized by Professor Charles G. Haines , the foremost authority in the United States on judicial review . In his American Doctrine of Judicial Supremacy , Haines points out that " the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . constitutions primarily in courts . . . and the dominance of judge-made law in accordance with common law standards and principles , constitute the bases of what may appropriately be termed the American doctrine of judicial supremacy . " 1 Laws are set down in words . These words convey meanings that must be interpreted both by administrators and often by the courts . As between these two groups of public officials , the judges have the final determination . Moreover , when it is realized how , of necessity , the language of modern legislation is technical and involves the use of vague terms such as " fair and reasonable , " " due consideration , " and " public interest , " it becomes clear how influential this final determination may actually he in shaping public policy . This is no new I ( ( . cit. , p. 27. 461  | development . Over two centuries ago Bishop Hoadly remarked , " Nay , whoever hath an absolute authority to interpret any written or spoken laws , it is He who is truly the Law-Giver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first wrote or spoke them . " The good bishop was referring to the divine law rather than to statutory law , but his observation is equally pertinent . One of our great chief justices , Charles Evans Hughes , spoke of the problem of interpreting the law in his book , The Supreme Court of the United States . " The court , " said Hughes , . " is the final interpreter of the Acts of Congress .  --   --  - Statutes come to the - judwial ts ... with respect to their true Importand a ederal statute n a means what the Court says it means . C=ongress voluntari y leaves muchtothe courts : ' 2 ( Ita Ics added . ) This fact of interpretaionby the courts is important of itself , but it becomes infinitely more imporrant when combined with the op vet to review legislative and executive acts and to hold them null and void . This chapter will start with a brief reminder of the different kinds of law in order to facilitate an understanding of the process of judicial review . It will then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other countries , and discuss the extent to which it has been used here , the process involved , and the social and legal effects . Next comes a discussion of the wide use made of the power of judicial review in connection with cases dealing with the state police power , as well as with the federal police power . Finally it takes up the various proposals which have been advanced to limit the power of judicial review . THE KINDS OF LAW Common law is the great body o$ ' private law which judges have interpreted in the Anglo-American legal system and which today forms one of the bases upon which our jurisprudence rests . The common law is grounded on decided cases which become precedents . Obviously , therefore , when old rules must be applied to new situations , the power of interpretation becomes crucial . Even in their interpretations of constitutions , judges are greatly influenced by the lore of their profession , the common law . Equity is a remedial branch of justice that grew up alongside the common law , broadening and liberalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common law have been merged . In large measure , equity is judge-made law because it involves the use of discretion and " the rule of reason " where the remedies of the common law are not adequate or where , if literally applied , such remedies would not result in substantial justice . Statutory law consists of the laws enacted by legislative bodies . This type of law has become so extensive that today it applies to almost every realm of human conduct . It is written by the legislature , but in case of dispute it must be interpreted by the courts .  | Constitutional law is the written or unwritten law dealing with the powers and organization of the government , the relation of each part of the government to the whole , and the relation of government to the citizen . Even when written down in one place , as has been noted , constitutional law still gives rise to an infinite variety of decisions in interpretation . When judges have the last word ? as they do ? their influence on social policy is unexcelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judicial interpretation . As interpreted by the courts , they tend to blend with each other . Constitutional law is a reflection of common law . Statutory law is replete with both common law and constitutional law . Judges may pick and choose , within limits , as to which kind of law shall be used in deciding each case . No judge in American history exemplified this practise more strikingly than Chief Justice Marshall of the Supreme Court . THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF LEGISLATION ? When the Supreme Court of the United States invalidates an act of Congress or of a state legislature on the ground that it is not in conformity with constitutional powers and provisions , it is exercising its power of judicial review . Chapter 9 showed how this power was enunciated by the Supreme Court , speaking through Chief Justice Marshall , in 1803 ( Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 ) , how the power then lay dormant until after the Civil War except for the Dred Scott decision , and how it has been widely used since the adoption of the Fourteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of law clause . judicial review is the examination by the courts , in cases actually before them , of legislative statutes and executive or administrative acts to determine whether or not they are prohibited by a written constitution or are in excess 0 powers granted by it . Innthe case of Marbury v. Madison Chief Justice Marshall argued that a written constitution , Which is declared to be the supreme law of the land and what ? the jZtd-ges ate  --  batted - by oath to uphold , makes the power to declare acts-of legislatures unconstitutional an inevitable d frd of jucICial authority . KlarsfialI s Interpretatlol was wicTeIy Isagreecwit at t e time an ? has seen challenged by prominent writers and large sections of the public ever since , 3 but there is no question that today it is deeply entrenched in our governmental system . The number of people who would defend judicial review exceed those who would eliminate it . a This , however , does not keep the question of judicial review from remaining a live issue . The appointment of new judges to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated , but sooner or later it is hound to rise again . Moreover , with a few exceptions which will be noted , the power footnote a Sec Edward S. Corwin , Court over Constitution ( New Haven , 1934 ) , Charles G. Haines , The Amrruzut Doctrine of Judicial Supremacy ( Berkeley , Calif. , 2nd ed. , 1932 ) , Chapter 1 , or Kohut K. Carr . Thr , t'ulrrrvue Court and Judicial Revuiv ( New York , 1912 ) , Chapter 11.  |p464  of state supreme courts to declare state legislation unconstitutional is also in full vigor today . As students of government we may favor this power or wish to modify it , but in either case we should understand that the existence of a written constitution does not necessarily involve the power to declare laws unconstitutional . Judges may interpret constitutional provisions ? just as they interpret the comIT1011 la'w ? Wit out possessing all authorl to Ill ? . . a e t e aw t ey interpret . The practice of other countries illustrates this - poifif- Ti is only when one assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of judicial review that the practice of overturning legislation becomes a necessary logical consequence . In Great Britain no such assumption is made . Great Britain has a constitution ? although in comparison with ours not so much of it is written down in one place ? and there the courts do not have the power to declare acts of Parliament null and void . Parliament is supreme . France , like the United States , has a written constitution , but the power of the courts to pass on the constitutionality of legislation has never been recognized there except in a very limited way . Why the difference ? For one thing , it is because in Great Britain Parliament is supreme . Equally important is the fact that the British and the French courts can not claim the power to uphold a " higher " law because none exists . Constitutional law , statutory law , and the common law ( or in France the civil law ) are all merged in a single body of law . Furthermore , if by interpretation the courts place a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature 's authority to clarify its intention in future cases will be respected by the courts . On the other hand , the power of the courts to review administrative acts , as distinguished from legislative acts , is as widely recognized in all countries as it is in the United States . Consequently , without calling into question the legislature 's authority to pass the law in the first place , administrative officials may be held to have acted in excess of their power or to have failed to give individuals their procedural rights . In short , in other countries there is judicial review of administration , but not of legislation . - In the United States , the Supreme Court is not the only tribunal possessing the power of judicial review . The other federal courts ? ninety district courts , and ten circuit courts of appeal plus that of the District of Columbia ? share in this power . But the Supreme Court makes the final decision in case of appeal . State courts also enjoy the power of judicial review in cases relating to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state appellate courts . Similarly , the state courts may interpret the federal Constitution and statutes , but when a " federal " question is involved , the federal courts on review will insist on conformity to the " higher law " of the federal Constitution . When a state law is in conflict with a federal statute or with  |p465  the federal Constitution , a state court decision may be reviewed by a federal court and a decision rendered there regarding constitutionality . Extent of Legislation Declared Unconstitutional ? In the century and a half since the Supreme Court of the United States began to function , approximately 80 acts of Congress , in whole or in part , have been declared unconstitutional . The issue has been increasing . In the first seventy years , for example , only 2 cases of unconstitutionality arose ; but in the four years between 1933 and 1937 , 13 federal and 53 state acts were declared null and void by the Supreme Court .  --  - The Supreme Court 's review and invalidation of state legislation has been far more extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been true since shortly after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1868 . The Court 's interpretation of the " due process of law " clause in the Fourteenth Amendment , says Professor Corwin , " today confers upon the court a practically discretionary veto power upon every state legislature . " 4 Between 1868 and 1889 , a period of twenty-one years , 71 cases involving judicial review of state legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment went to the Supreme Court . But between 1890 and 1901 , a period half as long , the total numbered 197 . Thus did judicial review accelerate after a slow start . In 1937 the " Court-packing " dispute arose between President Roosevelt and Congress . A substantial amount of New Deal legislation had been invalidated and there had been no occasion to alter the personnel of the Court . The President lost the battle in Congress but won the final victory . His proposal to add a new judge for each judge who failed to retire within six months after reaching the age of 70 , was turned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to white heat . It was admitted that Congress had the authority to take such action , but the method was criticized on the ground that it jeopardized the independence and integrity of the judiciary . But , replied the champions of reform , are we to allow the Supreme Court to emasculate the New Deal program under the guise of judicial review of legislation ? It was not long before the issue was solved , although not in the way the President and his supporters had originally sought . Vacancies arising in the Supreme Court 's membership were filled by justices known to be not opposed to New Deal legislation . Remaining members voted more often in favor of the constitutionality of Congressional measures and soon the decisions were typically 5 ? 4 or 6 ? 3 in favor of disputed acts instead of against them . Then followed a period during which more precedents were overturned than at any time in the history of the Supreme Court . The Process of Judicial Review ' There has been some misunderstanding on the part of the American public as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accord- footnote ' I'dw . Id S. C.r win , " Judicial Rcvicw , " linrwlnpedia of the . Soria ! Scienrec , ii1 , 1688.  |p466  ing to one mistaken view , every act of Congress and the forty-eight state legislatures must be reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States before it becomes law . This is not so . American courts review only those cases which come before them in the course of a dispute with regard to enforcement . Nor will the courts render advisory opinions . They will decide concrete cases or controversies placed before them , but they will not tell the legislature in advance what it may or may not do . The steps in judicial review are as follows : First , two parties to a dispute come before the Court . The decision turns on the provisions of a particular statute . The Court studies the provisions and if it finds them to be invalid , it is either because the legislature had no authority under the Constitution , or because the provisions conflict with a limitation contained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever the decision , the consequences reach far beyond the case involved , because it either confirms or invalidates that law in every similar case . It might be said , therefore , that unconstitutionality proceeds from the particular to the universal . Rules of Interpretation Followed by the Supreme Court Nowhere in the Constitution is the Supreme Court expressly authorized to declare legislative and executive acts null and void . There does , however , seem to have been some precedent in the powers of state courts . Why , then , if it was intended that the Supreme Court should have this authority , was it not so stated ? The Supreme Court itself has assumed the power of judicial review and , if it chose , could divest itself of that function or partially circumscribe it. - 5o many surprising reversals of precedent have occurred in recent years that attion of this kind would not seem to be entirely out of the question . The Court , for example , could hold that the due process provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution were never intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to human beings . So selfdenying an ordinance would be astonishing but it is not inconceivable . The Court has already adopted several rules indicating a desire to avoid policy decisions as much as possible and to confine itself to strictly judicial matters . The most important of these rules of judicial construction are the following : The presumption is in favor of the constitutionality of legislation , and the Court will so find wherever it can . This the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated . The benefit of the doubt rule , according to which , if there is any doubt on the point , the decision will be in favor of upholding the legislation . Cases are preferably disposed of on nonconstitutional grounds . If the issue of the constitutionality of a law can be avoided and justice secured , this will be done . footnote 5 Oliver 1 ' . Field , The 1 ( Jrrt of an Unconstitutional . Shrhdc ( Minncap , lk , IrriSi.  |p467  A statute that is constitutional on its face will be upheld . Such a statute will not be invalidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principle of separability . Where part of a statute is considered uncons'itutional and the remainder is not , the valid section will be sustained if it s ' ands by itself . The court will not decide so-called political questions . In this context , a ( political question is one which , in the Court 's opinion , should be determined 1 by the political branches of the government ? the legislative and the executive . An example of this is the question of what constitutes a republican form of government , guaranteed by the Constitution to every state . As a rule , the matter of whether a question is political or nonpolitical is something to be decided by the Supreme Court itself in each case . These are the main self-limiting rules the Supreme Court has imposed on itself . The extent to which the Court observes or merely pays lip service to them in the leading cases is a fascinating study , because in a large measure the outcome has depended on the membership of the Court at the particular time the issue arose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is more certainty than in others . In some sections of the common law the rule is fairly clear , but in other areas of law the rules are more vague . Because of the complexity of modern society , furthermore , no two situations are exactly alike . The words themselves are ambiguous ; the " necessary and proper " clause of the Constitution is a case in point , or the " due process of law " clause which judges say can not even be defined . Accordingly , the less certain the rule and the wider the discretion , the greater becomes the policy-making influence of the judge . Constitutional law more than any other is characterized by these broad areas of discretion .

A decision adversely affecting one group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , favoring a different economic bloc , is roundly applauded . Hence , for better or for worse , the Supreme Court is in politics . Public criticism is as legitimate as it is inevitable . And , as Mr. Dooley once said , the Supreme Court follows the election returns . This is not the customary situation of a judicial tribunal , to be sure . But is there any escape save the relinquishment of the power of judicial review of legislation ? Pressure groups use one set of methods on the legislature , another on the administration , and still a third on the courts . The public is aware that in close cases involving social issues , it is policy and not law in the strict sense that the courts are deciding . Mr. Justice Holmes , one of the fairest and most intelligent judges this coun-  |p468  try has ever produced , summarized this situation in his Collected Legal Papers . " I think it most important , " said Holmes , " to remember whenever a doubtful case arises , with certain analogies on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is before us is a conflict between the two social desires , each of which seeks to extend its dominion over the case , and which can not both have their way . The social question is which desire is stronger at the point of conflict . " ? ( Italics added . ) The English legal historian , A. V. Dicey , once said in a Harvard Law School lecture that " the Courts or the judges , when acting as legislators , are of course influenced by the beliefs and feelings of their time , and are guided to a considerable extent by the dominant current of public opinion .... " Of the influence of judges on policy , Dean Roscoe Pound of the Harvard Law School comments that " it is not what the legislature desires , but what the courts regard as juridically permissible that in the end becomes law . Statutes give way before the settled habits of legal thinking which we call the common law . Judges and jurists do not hesitate to assert that there are extraconstitutional limits to legislative power which put fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 The Legal Effect of Judicial Review . An act of the legislature that is brought to question before a court will be held either constitutional or unconstitutional . If it is upheld as being within the constitutional power of the legislature which passed it , the law does not possess any more legal effect than it had before , but people are more likely to respect it . This is particularly true where business , labor , and other interests are directly affected by such legislation . We Americans are so accustomed to the x factor of constitutionality that we often keep our fingers crossed until a test case has gone before the highest state or federal court and has been decided one way or the other . If the Court holds that a particular law is inconsistent with the C ii , that law h as n rther effect . If is as fhougli t act lia d lever been gassed in thfirst place . It does not follow , however , that everything t at was done between the passage of the act and its invalidation is retroactively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general rule is that rights vested by an act later declared unconstitutional may , in some cases , be respected when otherwise they would affect adversely " innocent third parties " ; but wherever the situation can be unscrambled without such damage , the court usually orders retroactive application . Two contrasting hypothetical cases will illustrate this point . In the first , a state public-utility commission restricts the profits of a utility enterprise on the basis of a particular valuation theory , or method by which the value of the footnote " Loc. cit. , p. 239. 7 " Taw in Books anti Los ' in Action , " American Lair Rrrrrtr , NI.IV ' ( fan. - Pelt. , I'H111 ) 27.  |p469  utility is computed . The utility company starts a suit and in the meantime part of its earnings is impounded by court order awaiting the outcome of the suit . The court declares that the valuation basis used is unconstitutional . The impounded funds thereafter belong to the utility . In another case a city condemns a farmer 's land , pays him for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the city relies to uphold its authority is declared unconstitutional . ' But the court will protect the farmer by allowing him to keep the money paid him for his flooded land ; otherwise an injustice would be done to an innocent third party . There are two factors to remember when assessing the effect of judicial review . First , a judicial veto is like a stone dropped into a pool of water . The impact spreads out in circles . An adverse decision may cause Congress and the state governments to give up attempts to enforce laws similar to the one declared unconstitutional , or it may effectively discourage them from passing new laws in the same field . Many examples of this could be cited . For one , Professor Walter F. Dodd has pointed out that when the Supreme Court held that the states lacked the power to regulate private employment offices ( Ribnik v. McBride , 277 U. S. 350. 1928 ) , the effect was not confined to New jersey , where the case arose . At least twenty other states were deterred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal to nationalize the employment office business and transfer it from private to public hands . The second point to remember is that not only is the enforcement of similar laws impeded , but the federal and state governments , discouraged by judicial vetoes , may also be less willing to pass social legislation , regulatory measures , and other laws thought to be in the public interest . In the United States we probably pass too many laws , but not too many of the right kind . We sometimes fail to legislate when we should , or we take action too late to be of any use . It is here that the generally deterring effect of judicial review may work a real harm . But the importance of this factor is not always general . It sometimes happens that when all or part of a statute has been held null and void , the judicial veto excites the sponsor 's determination to frame a modified measure that will pass judicial muster . An example of this is the modified Agricultural Adjustment Administration Act passed during the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mr. Justice Holmes once made the comment that the American political system consists of forty-eight insulated laboratories where each state is free to experiment with the social laws and policies it chooses . If a policy turns out to be successful , it is usually imitated by other states ; and if it fails , the harm has been less than if all states had adopted it in the first place . This ability to experiment is the essence of popular government . So , also , is the power and footnote " I t . Jt with in Chapter I . " ' I'hr Problem , of Agriculture "  |p470  responsibility of the people 's elected representatives to carry through programs required by social change . The nullifying of an important piece of social legislation , therefore , is a serious matter . Adverse decisions on constitutionality may cause a serious social lag , or they may even aggravate the original difficulty . Pollock v. Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company ( 158 U.

The effect of the adverse decision was to retard for a generation a tax policy that is now considered indispensable . When the Supreme Court turns down a group of major enactments representing the policy and program of the party in power , the effect on party leadership may be serious . Uncertainty may cause a virtual legislative stalemate . In the period following World War I , says Professor Robert Carr in The Supreme Court and Judicial Review , " one can hardly deny that the invalidation of the child labor laws , an important portion of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act , the National Industrial Recovery Act , the Railway Workers ' Pension Act , the Farm Mortgage Relief Act , the Bituminous Coal Ac , and the Municipal Bankruptcy Act has definitely affected the program of the national government . " ' A deadlock between any two branches of the government is an invitation to social drift in which anarchy threatens if it is allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter noted that according to a provision of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution , intended as a protection to Negroes released from slavery , no state shall " deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . " It was not long , however , before the Supreme Court had interpreted this wording to include protection to an artificial person , the corporation . Thereupon cases of judicial review began to turn on the question of whether the exercise of the police power of the state deprived corporations of " life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . " This marked the beginning of the period in which judicial review of legislation was to become a basic and perennial issue of American politics . The police power ? which is the reserved powers of the states to legislate concerning matters of public safety , welfare , health , and morals ? deals almost exclusively with matters of social legislation . In a succession of cases the courts have had to decide whether social legislation or due process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , due process of law can not be defined , the role of statesmanship that the judges themselves have had to assume in the interpretation of the law has been a heavy one . In general , state power has been still further restricted while that of the federal government was expanded .  |p471  Liberty and Property One of the points raised by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution concerns the definition of the words " liberty " and " property . " What is liberty ? Liberty has been interpreted by the courts to mean many things . In one case it is the freedom of employers to fix the wages of their workers without interference by the state in the exercise of its police power , unless the Supreme Court considers such interference as reasonable . This issue appears in the case of Lochner v. New York ( 198 U. S. 45. 1905 ) , where the state of New York attempted to . limit the hours of bakers on the ground that their work affects the public health . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived the employer of his liberty of contract protected under the Fourteenth Amendment and that it was not , therefore , a regulation which could be sustained even on the grounds that it was an exercise of the police power of the state . It is interesting to note that in this case Mr. Justice Holmes entered a vigorous dissent to the majority opinion of the Court , in the course of which he said , " It is settled by various decisions of this court that state constitutions and state laws may regulate life in many ways which we as legislators might think as injudicious or , if you like , as tyrannical as this , and which equally interfere with the liberty of contract .... Every opinion tends to become a law . I think that the word liberty ' in the Fourteenth Amendment is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion . . . . " ( Italics ours . ) What is property ? The answer is one of the most difficult in the field of the social sciences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , not merely the property itself . Cases concerning the regulation of public utilities abound in this area . What , for example , is a fair valuation of public-utility properties to be used as the basis of determining the rates that may be charged ? Is it the original cost of the enterprise including plant , wiring , rails , rights of way , and so on ? Is it the cost of reproducing the property years later ? Or is it the " prudent " investment , meaning the financial outlay that men of business acumen and good judgment would approve ? This is the kind of question with which the Supreme Court has had to deal . See , for example , the case of Ohio Water Company v. Ben Avon Borough ( 253 U. S. 287. 1919 ) . What rate of return shall be allowed on the investment ? Shall it be 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , or 7 per cent ? In the case of United Railways and Electric Co. of Baltimore v. West ( 280 U. S. 234. 1929 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent on a street railway , but the Supreme Court decided it should be 7.44 per cent and that anything less would be " confiscatory . " The Range of Social Questions The range of questions which come within the area of the police power and which must he decided by the courts is of unequaled economic and social  |p472  import . May working hours for women be limited ? If so , in what occupations and to what extent ? May the working hours of children in industry be kept to a minimum , and if so , in what industries ? How about floors under wages , adult male as well as female ? How far may the government go in protecting the consumer against fraud and misrepresentation as related to advertising ? What kinds of business may be regulated and which ones may not ? Why should the milk business be subject to extensive control 10 but the ice business exempt ? 11 And why should the resale price of theater tickets 1 ' ? and the charges of private employment exchanges Y3 not be subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public " and what is " private " ? Should the highest court of the land exercise the final judgment on these questions of social policy ? This field will be dealt with more extensively at a later point . The illustrations given here are only to show the breadth and complexity of the judicial decisions that must be made . When two undefinable concepts clash , what happens ? The police power is supposedly expansible and incapable of precise definition . It widens as the range of social problems grows . The concept of the due process of law is similarly lacking in precision . Of it , Professor ( now Mr. Justice ) Felix Frankfurter once remarked that the due process clauses as found in the Constitution are " in words so undefined , either by their intrinsic meaning , or by history , or by tradition , that they leave the individual Justice free , if indeed they do not actually compel him , to fill in the vacuum with his own controlling notions of economic , social , and industrial facts with reference to which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of the federal police power , the problem of judicial interpretation is akin to that found in connection with the police power of the states . Making use of its commerce and taxing authority , Congress , as noted in another chapter , has assumed an influence in social legislation deserving of the term " police power . " But Congress is not always successful in asserting its alleged authority any more than the states are . Can the products of child labor , for example , be excluded from interstate commerce by Congressional legislation ? Impure foods and drugs have been . Lotteries were . The transportation of women for immoral purposes has been made a penal offense . Oleomargarine colored to look like butter may be taxed at an excessively high rate and the Supreme Court will not look into any motive other than revenue . The products of prison industries footnote 10 Nebbia v. New York ( 291 U. S. 502. 1934 ) . 11 New State Ice Company v. Liebmann ( 285 U. S. 262. 1930 ) ; see particularly the Brandeis dissent . 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this case is notable for the Holmes dissent . 13 Ribnik v. McBride ( 277 U. S. 350. 1928 ) . 14 Cerro and Politics , ed. by Archibald MacLeish and F. F. Prichard , Jr . ( Ness ' York , 1919 ) , p . I J.  |p473  may be excluded from interstate commerce . Congress has regulated the liquor traffic . Indeed , Congress has scored numerous and telling successes at the hands of the Supreme Court , but it has also met with difficulties . Twice within four years the Supreme Court ruled unfavorably on federal attempts to regulate child labor . In Hammer v. Dagenhart ( 247 U. S. 251. 1918 ) , Congress relied on its power over interstate commerce to keep the products of child labor out of the stream of commerce , but the Supreme Court held the act unconstitutional . The link between child labor and interstate commerce , said the Court , was so slight as to be virtually nonexistent . Four years later , in the case of Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Company ( 259 U. S. 20. 1922 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of existence was called into question , and again Congress was thwarted . The Court said that the levies appeared to be penalties rather than bona fide taxes . Parenthetically , how is it possible to square this with the attitude of the Court in refusing to look into the motives behind a tax on oleomargarine colored to look like butter ? 15 A generation went by during which , as Dean Edith Abbott has put it , " an army of children had come and gone from the mills and factories and lumber yards . " Finally in 1941 the Supreme Court expressly overruled its former decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart . In the case of United States v. Darby Lumber Company ( 312 U. S. 100. 1941 ) , the Court held that the authority of the commerce power was sufficient to deny the facilities of interstate commerce to producers who failed to abide by labor standards prescribed by Congress . The decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart , said the Court , was a " departure from principles " which " should be and now is overruled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social legislation is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in a close decision ? a 5 ? 4 decision , let us say ? then popular resentment sometimes lasts a long time . Moreover , when the issue of judicial review has been a constant problem for almost a century and a half , and has increased in intensity within the past fifty years , it seems clear that the matter is far from settled . Several moves have been made to restrict judicial review . Some of the states have limited the power of their supreme courts to hold acts unconstitutional . Ohio has passed a constitutional amendment forbidding its highest court to hold an act null and void if two or more judges consider it valid . Except where the decision affirms that of the next lower court , this means that six of the seven judges must agree . Similar provisions are found in Nebraska and North Dakota . The states , therefore , have taken the lead in dealing with the difficult question of limiting judicial review . Proposals to limit the power of the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' r.ry . I ' S. ( IOC IT . S. ? 7. 1q(Ti).  |p474  declare legislation unconstitutional are numerous , some dating back to the early years of our history . The principal ones are these : A two-thirds vote . A two-thirds vote of the Supreme Court would be required to declare an act of Congress or of a state legislature unconstitutional . This would rule out the 5-4 decisions ? which unfortunately have been all too frequent ? and would make the requirement 6-3 . Other suggested ratios are 7-2 and even 8-1 . This reform could be accomplished in one of three ways . The simplest , if the judges favored such a plan , would be by a rule of the Supreme Court itself . It could also be done by an act of Congress ( which the Court might or might not uphold ) , or by constitutional amendment . Legislation to this effect was introduced in Congress as early as 1823 , and in view of the continued currency of the idea this method may have the best chance of ultimate success . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marbury v. Madison in 1803 , but it seems quite unlikely to be used . Congressional abolition of courts . The Supreme Court is the only tribunal specifically provided for in the federal Constitution . Congress has created all of the other federal courts and presumably could abolish them if it chose . But this hardly seems an appropriate procedure for getting constructive action . Limited jurisdiction over cases . Except with regard to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court , the Constitution has given Congress the power to determine what classes of cases the federal judiciary shall hear . The use of this power to limit the courts might be helpful , but there are objections to it if it interferes with the independence of the judiciary . Congressional overriding of a judicial veto . It has been proposed that Congress be permitted by a two-thirds vote to repass measures invalidated by the Court . This plan , advanced by Senator Robert M. La Follette , Sr. , in his 1924 presidential campaign and revived by Senator Burton Wheeler in 1937 , would require a constitutional amendment ; otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At present a basic principle of the judiciary is that court decisions must be final , that they can not be reviewed or overturned by another branch of the government . Increase in the membership of the Court . This is the so-called Court-packing idea . It is the club that the House of Commons successfully brandished against the House of Lords in 1911 . Congress has full power to alter the membership of the Court at any time ; in fact , on several occasions the number of justices on the Supreme Court has been increased or decreased . Once as low as five and another time as high as ten , it has been nine since 1869 . The purpose of the increase , of course , would be to appoint members to the Court who would look favorably on the particular legislative program of the administration in office . Compulsory retirement of judges . The retirement age usually suggested is seventy . Compulsory retirement has become common in industry and the professions , hut in the courts retirement is optional at a given age , usually seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a plan would require a popular vote ? by placing the question on the ballot at election time ? in cases where the Court 's decision was objected to by the people . President Theodore Roosevelt once considered this idea . Modernization and clarification of the federal Constitution at vital spots . According to this proposal , the Constitution would be overhauled to make it clear that the reserved powers of the states should not be judicially restricted , that the Fourteenth Amendment was never meant to apply to corporations , and that judicial review of legislation was or was not intended . Although there is much to commend the idea , once they were made the clarifications themselves would have to be judicially interpreted . Constructive criticism by the public , the press , and other organs of opinion . So long as the Supreme Court remains sufficiently sensitive to public opinion so as to follow the election returns , it is argued , there is nothing fundamentally to be feared in the judicial review of legislation . It is true that the Court must sometimes make policy decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every area of the law , and it is the function of the courts to decide such questions . That constructive criticism is a good and normal thing is indicated by the fact that the Court has been the target of criticism since its origin and presumably it will continue to be . So runs the argument . ' s But Someone Must Have the Final Determination Most political scientists agree that in every governmental system the world has ever known , the final decision has resided in one of its three branches ? legislative , executive , or judicial ? or in the people themselves . All three branches of government have an opportunity to interpret the law and to help mold it , but the final determination must rest at a particular point , universally recognized . According to the supporters of judicial review , in determining the meaning of constitutional provisions , legislative enactments , and executive actions , the Supreme Court has no more authority than one or another of the three branches has in the government of every other nation . Where parliamentary supremacy exists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a dictatorship , executive is supreme . Li a pure democracy such as that of Athens or the Swiss cantons at an early period , the people themselves are the ultimate authority . In our government that final power is exercised by the highest court of the land . By the training , temperament , and qualification of its personnel , it is argued , the nation 's highest court is best equipped to make the final determinations in matters of statesmanship . Furthermore , it is held that the Constitution is safer in the hands of judges Than in those of either of the other two branches . And ultimately , if the people footnote ' " I'r , r a full devclulmunt of these hrolxrsak , sec Robert K. Carr , The Supreme ' Coma and /t. ? iri rl krricn ' ( rw York , 1r 12 ) , l " , i , ur , r r I I  |p476  disapprove , they may exercise their power to change the Constitution by overriding the decisions of the Supreme Court as they did in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true . But according to this viewpoint , conservatism is the best policy in the long run . Respect for law is the basis of free institutions ; judges presumably have more respect for law than any other group . And , as Mr. Justice Holmes frequently said , " the life of the law is not logic , but experience . " Yes , comes the rejoinder , but what if the questions are policy decisions and not of a legal nature in the strict sense ? That raises the age-old question : What is law ? SUPPLEMENTARY READING 1 .

F. Willoughby observed that political scientists had devoted less attention to judicial administration than to any other major field ; that while lawyers and judges also had neglected it , this was largely because they do not think in administrative terms , whereas political scientists have been trained in this discipline and might have been expected to show more interest ; and that " of the many tasks confronting the modern government , none exceeds in importance that of the administration of justice . " In fact , Professor Willoughby went so far as to claim that this is " the primary function of government . " Many of us never become litigants , fortunately ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mean a great deal to us . The present unfavorable situation in the administration of justice in the United States is consequently a matter of concern to all . This chapter , therefore , will give a brief comparative summary of judicial organization in other countries , which will be followed by separate discussions of the federal , state , and local courts in the United States . And finally it will consider some over-all principles of judicial administration and suggestions for improving the system at the several levels . The Need for Constructive Reform Our American courts ? like every other part of government ? have been overwhelmed with the flood of business arising from the complexities of our modern society . There is probably no function of government , says Professor Willoughby , performed with less efficiency and economy than the administration of justice . " Both our system of courts and their methods of procedure are almost universally recognized as unsatisfactory . " And he quotes leaders of the bench and the bar in substantiation . " In their practical operations , " continues Professor Willoughby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to litigants . They perform their work with great dilatoriness , and miscarriages of justice are frequent . " This is no theorist speaking from his ivory tower . Prr , : , fessor Willoughby was trained as a lawyer himself . He had minutely investigated his subject , and was quoting members of the profession . William Howard Taft enjoyed the unusual distinction of being successively both President of the United States and ( Thief Justice of the Supreme Court . No man in American history has done more to improve the organization of  |p478  federal court structure and administration . " If one were asked , " said Chief Justice Taft , " in which respect we had fallen furthest short of ideal conditions in our whole government , I think we would be justified in answering , in spite of the glaring defects of our system of municipal government , that it is in our failure to secure expedition and thoroughness in the enforcement of public and private rights in our courts . " Dean Roscoe Pound of Harvard , in an American Bar Association Report , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure behind the times . Uncertainty , delay and expense and above all the injustice of deciding cases upon points of practice which are the mer:z etiquette of justice ? direct results of the organization of our courts and the backwardness of our procedure ? have created a deep-rooted desire to keep out of court , right or wrong , on the part of every sensible business man in the community . " There has been some improvement since these two leaders of the legal profession uttered these words and since Professor Willoughby wrote his book . But many of the basic problems ? such as duplicating federal and state jurisdictions , overloaded calendars resulting in expense and delay , excessive technicalities and formalities , the multiplication of special courts at the municipal and other levels , lack of an integrated court structure , and the shortcomings of the justice of the peace courts ? are still with us today . If the student can understand what some of the central problems are , his investigation of structure and functioning is likely to be more meaningful . Judicial Administration in Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the efficiency of judicial administration ? Seventy-five years ago the problem in Great Britain was worse than our own . Dissatisfaction had been acute ever since the Napoleonic Wars but reforms were postponed on that account and others . The organization of the courts was so complicated that it did not make sense . The king 's exchequer , for example , was exercising court functions in determining the validity of fiscal exemptions and in enforcing debts due the crown . Another difficulty arose from the fact that the king 's courts were superimposed on manorial courts . Then special courts ? such as those dealing with admiralty ? were created . By the middle of the nineteenth century it was next to impossible to know in which court a case really belonged . Attorneys , as in the United States today , would seek the jurisdiction and the judge that seemed most likely to favor their side of the case . And there was nothing approaching uniformity of procedural requirements . The Judicature Act of 1873 , which went into effect two years later , attempted to solve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two divisions : the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal . A year later , in 1876 , the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords was regularized and improved . Perhaps the most important part of this sweeping reform was the creation of it judicial council to survey problems of judicial administration  |p479  for the realm , to integrate the court structure , and to recommend the transfer of judges where the load was heaviest . In France and on the Continent generally , the administration of justice became " a bureaucratic judicial system of higher and lower courts " much more quickly than in England . As early as the thirteenth century , for example , the so-called Parlements ( judicial rather than legislative bodies and having no lawmaking function ) successfully claimed the right to review many classes of cases originating in the manorial courts . By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the tendency toward integration at the national level became apparent , and the process was accelerated when the Revolution of 1789 swept away much of the old . Napoleon , famous for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a form it has retained ever since . The present system includes courts of prirnary jurisdiction , a second layer of intermediate or appeal courts , and a supreme court ( Court of Cassation ) topping the pyramid . Alongside these civil courts is a separate hierarchy of administrative courts dealing with administrative matters such as claims , the excessive use of power , and so on . And at the pinnacle of both systems , settling conflicts of jurisdiction , is a special Court of Conflicts , created for that purpose . The following diagram illustrates this type of court system : France , Germany , and most other European nations have long had more symmetry and integration in their judicial as well as in their legal systems than either the British or ourselves . The difference is due in part at least to the influence of the orderly codified Roman civil law that prevailed on the Continent , as against that of the less systematic common law which grew up in England , and from which we inherited our own system , the bad with the good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in Anglo-American jurisdictions ? that the courts are an integral part of governmental machinery . As Professor Max Radin has remarked , l the constitutional struggles of seventeenth-and eighteenth-century England " allowed the lawyers and judges to grow into something like a separate estate of the realm and to assume an unrivalled independence and power . " The chief difference , therefore , is between the orderly growth of legal institutions on the Continent and their spontaneous , independent development in England . FEDERAL COURT STRUCTURE IN THE UNITEI ) STATES In an effort to deal with the problems of judicial administration that we in herited and then aggravated , a movement has developed among lawyers and students of government to centralize and unify the court structure in the United States . This movement is most pronounced at the federal level , but it is also marked in approximately a third of the states . In the federal government there is a hierarchy of three kinds of courts : the district courts at the Nt.n R.ulin , " C'nurt , , " Iinrvrlopedi , r Of air . Sori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts of appeals above them , and the Supreme Court of the United States at the top . But it was not always as simple as that . The trend toward integration has been growing since 1891 , when Congress abolished the old circuit courts and established in their place the circuit courts of appeals . The key word in the designation of these courts is appeals , for since that time they have dealt exclusively with appeal cases and have had no primary ( original ) jurisdiction . The distinction between original and appellate jurisdiction is essential to an understanding of judicial reform . Original jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases in the first instance . It is where a case is begun . If neither party takes an appeal , that is the end of the matter . Appellate jurisdiction is the authority of a court to review and decide cases or controversies on appeal after they have been acted upon by inferior tribunals . In the federal court structure , district courts deal exclusively with original jurisdiction . The circuit courts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily an appeal court , but it has original jurisdiction as set forth in the Constitution in cases involving ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , and those in which a state is a party . figure We have taken four main steps in attempting to unify our federal court system . ' The first was the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of 1891 . This important enactment , as has been noted , made the intermediate level of courts exclusively appeal tribunals . In so doing , Congress took much of the appeal load off the Supreme Court and moved the original jurisdiction down to the primary level . This simplified the whole federal court arrangement by placing particular functions at each level : original jurisdiction at the bottom ( except for the special original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court ) , appeal at the intermediate level , and final settlement , where that was necessary , at the top . footnote See Felix Frankfurter and lames Landis , The Business of the Supreme Court of the United sat , c ( Ni Yolk , I " : ' 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coordinating administrative mechanism ? the annual conference of senior court officials in 1922 . This brought into being an administrative device similar to the judicial council that Great Britain adopted in 1873 , and that a third of our states have also put into effect . Officially known as The Annual Conference of Senior Circuit Judges , it holds a meeting each year in Washington at which the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides . Each of the senior judges in the ten circuits reports on and discusses problems common to all ? the need for more judges , the assignment of judges , problems in court procedure , in appeal cases , in administrative organization , and in the personnel of the courts . Thus , in effect , the senior circuit judge now holds a supervisory relationship to the district judges in his circuit . The conference , which affords judges an opportunity to discuss and compare their problems , has been responsible " for many concrete reforms . Needless to say , it has a standardizing effect on the whole federal court structure . A third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William Howard Taft and Charles Evans Hughes did much to lay thr groundwork for the passage of this important measure , which is the clearest indication we have of the responsibility assumed by judges for the administrative improvement of the courts . The matter is interestingly dealt with in a book by Frankfurter and Landis , The Business of the Supreme Court of the United States . The Judge 's Bill was drafted and passed in order to solve a serious problem arising from the fact that the Supreme Court was swamped with work . At the end of the judicial session each year many cases were still unheard . The Supreme Court was considering too many unimportant matters ? common law instead of public law cases . Some means of confining the attention of the Supreme Court to questions of constitutional law had to be found because these were of the greatest moment to the country . It was concluded that there must be fewer cases and more significant ones . The solution was to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court . Appeals that were formerly matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , since 1925 the Supreme Court will , in most instances , take a case on appeal only when it " reaches down for it " ? the technical term is certiorari . The rules of appellate procedure will be further explained in the following section . The latest and most significant move in the direction of greater unity and efficiency in our federal court structure was the creation by Congress in 1939 of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , headed by a director . This logical implementation of the judicial conference created in 1922 gives the Chief Justice and the federal court officials the assistance of a full-time administrator . He is mainly concerned with the business administration of the courts , including finance , organization , and materiel , and with procedural studies and the compilation of statistics as a basis for policy decisions and the adoption of improved methods . The creation of this office marks an enormous stride forward . Indeed , since 1801 the federal judiciary has come a long way  |p482  in clarifying jurisdictions , tightening up organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court at Work The Supreme Court of the United States occupies a special place in our federal court system , as well as in that of the states . The Supreme Court sits annually from October to May and hears about a thousand cases each year . The majority of these cases result in memorandum decisions on which extensive opinions do not have to be prepared . Its decisions and opinions are published in the United States Reports . Original jurisdiction . The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court , as fixed by the federal Constitution , applies to " all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers , and consuls , and those in which a State shall be a party . " There has been a modification , however , with regard to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in cases in which a state is a party . Since the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution in 1798 , no state may be sued , even in the Supreme Court of the United States , unless it consents to such a suit . The case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided in 1793 , wherein the Supreme Court allowed a citizen of South Carolina to sue the state of Georgia , gave rise to this constitutional restriction . Suits against the dignity of a sovereign state were regarded at this time as totally objectionable and the resulting Eleventh Amendment ( the first after the Bill of Rights amendments ) was speedily pushed through . It excepts from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court ( and all federal courts ) any case brought against one of the states by a citizen of another state or of a foreign state . The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court may not be enlarged by act of Congress because , as stated in Mcarbury v. Madison , that would be tantamount to amending the Constitution in an unauthorized manner . Appellate jurisdiction . Most cases coming before : : the Supreme Court are appeal cases , either from the inferior federal courts or from the highest state courts . The Supreme Court has no trouble in controlling the matter of which cases shall be appealed from the federal district and circuit courts of appeals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the court of appeals ; but where there is a certificate of division ( inability to agree ) from the lower court , or if the Supreme Court wishes to grant the writ of certiorari , a particular case may be taken from the circuit court of appeals to the Supreme Court . Only rarely , as in the case of some of the federal regulatory commissions , does Congress provide for a direct appeal from the district court to the Supreme Court , thus eliminating the court of appeals stage . With regard to appeals from the decisions of the highest state courts , the situation is different in important respects . In all instances in which a federal circuit court of appeals declares a state law unconstitutional , the case automatically goes to the Supreme Court . Again , as guardian of the Constitution and of national supremacy , the Supreme Court must hear cases involving these  |p483  interests . In controversies coming from the highest state courts , these " federal question " cases are of two principal kinds . First , there are those in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court has denied or ignored rights vested under the Constitution , the laws , or the treaties of the United States . Second , there are those in which a state constitution or statute is alleged to be in conflict with the Constitution , the laws , or the treaties of the United States . State courts may decide cases involving the federal Constitution and federal laws , and in some instances Congress has encouraged them to assume such jurisdiction as a means of relieving the federal courts , but the Supreme Court sees to it that all such interpretations are in conformity with its own interpretation of the Constitution , the laws , and the treaties of the United States . But even allowing for these " federal question " cases where appeals are mandatory , there remain a large number of miscellaneous cases ? involving private disputes under the common law , criminal cases , many types of regulatory cases , and the like ? and in all of these the Supreme Court uses its discretionary power to determine which are sufficiently important to be heard and decided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the limitation of the right of appeal to the Supreme Court in 1925 , it has been possible to allow a more extensive oral argument before that tribunal . Decisions by the Court are accompanied by written opinions ( facts , issues , decisions , reasoning ) , some of which are of great length and constitute state papers of enormous value and influence . Justices who disagree may write a dissenting opinion . These minority opinions are significant because they often become the majority viewpoint at a later date . A few dissenting opinions , such as those of Holmes and Brandeis , contain some of the finest utterances in the English language . Any statements not essentially related to the argument at hand are called obiter dicta ( statements over and above ) . These do not have the force of law but , like minority opinions , they frequently assume great importance at a later date , and are frequently cited as indicating the Court 's opinion on a particular subject . THE ORGANIZATION OF STATE COURT SYSTEMS As is to be expected , the forty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal hierarchy . Possibly a third of the states have been as progressive as the federal government . It is the remaining two thirds that are largely responsible for the opprobrious designation , " dark continent of political science , " which is often applied to judicial administration . No state has yet established a completely unified court system , taking in courts at all levels . But a third of the states have created judicial countifls. judicial council is an advisory body of judges and practicing attoe sometimes of judges alone , set up to study the organization and rules c1 cedure of the courts and to recommend improvements to the judicta , legislature , or both .  |p484  Wisconsin pioneered in this direction when she created a Board of Circuit Judges in 1913 , although she did not actually use the term " judicial council . " Massachusetts created a judicial council in 1919 ? 1924 ; among the other states which have followed are California , Connecticut , Kansas , North Carolina , Ohio , Oregon , Rhode Island , Virginia , and Washington . Thus all sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there remains a good deal of territory to be covered . In about a dozen cases , including Louisiana , Michigan , and Wisconsin , the state constitution contains provisions laying the basis for extensive judicial selfimprovement , but the use that has been made of the power varies considerably . In the states mentioned , for example , the state supreme court is given a " general superintending control " over all inferior courts . Such provisions , if greater use were made of them , would seem to justify a reasonable degree of coordination or even unification . Other states lack specific constitutional authorizations , but legislative initiative is open to them and may be used to accomplish piecemeal reform . State and Federal Judicial Hierarchies Compared In contrast to the federal judicial system with its three layers of courts , there are in the states typically four or five layers . The differences between the two systems may be shown as follows : figure No attempt will be made here to explain the organization and function of each of these courts . In the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . Some of the lower courts , however , will be singled out for special attention . Equity The equity courts , which occupy a special place in our legal system , are of English origin . In the United States they exist in both the federal and the state systems , although they are important only in the states . In line with the tendency to simplify and combine jurisdictions , equity and law courts- have  |p485  been combined in the federal system and in all of the states save six . Then exceptions are Alabama , Arkansas , Delaware , Mississippi , New Jersey , and Tennessee . Equity was originally a rival of the common law and as such helped the latter to grow and become less rigid and formalized during an important stage of its development . Equity emphasizes justice as against technical rules , informality of procedure , the presentation of the whole case , and the use of remedies other than those found in the common law . Equity , therefore , has constituted a dynamic , living influence in the molding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving a multiplicity of suits and cross suits , and usually involves controversies for which remedies are not available in the common law . When equity and common law jurisdictions are combined , the same judge in the same court generally presides over both classes of cases . Municipal Court Unification With the rapid growth of American cities there has naturally been a concentration of judicial business in urban centers . Because the existing court structure was unprepared for such a diversion of emphasis , the result in most cases was a proliferation of municipal courts , overlapping the jurisdiction of county and state courts and without much rhyme or reason . There are police courts , night courts , traffic courts , juvenile courts , rent courts , domestic relations courts , and so on . Among the large cities , Chicago pioneered in creating a unified municipal court system . Constitutional authority was secured in 1904 . The Chicago municipal court created in 1906 has since been a model for other large cities . There is a chief justice and numerous associate justices . The total judicial business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice . In addition , a judicial council with effective powers was created . According to the enabling act , " the Chief Justice of the municipal court , in addition to the exercise of all the other powers of a judge of said court , shall have the general superintendence of the business of the court ; he shall preside at all meetings of the judges , and he shall assign the associate judges to duty in the branch courts .... " Additional responsibilities of the chief justice include the preparation of calendars , the distribution of cases , and the duty of receiving monthly reports on business transacted . This Chicago municipal court , established even before federal and state reform , is a model of judicial organization today . It has since been followed by several other leading cities including New York , Detroit , Cleveland , and Baltimore . County Courts A principal reason for strengthening county government is the position of the county court as the backbone of the sotto system . Almost cvcrv  |p486  one of the 3,050 counties in the United States has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal action , frequently , and especially in the less populous states , it has unlimited jurisdiction . The county court has a great deal of original civil jurisdiction , and it also acts in an appellate capacity on civil cases coming up from justices of the peace and other petty courts . The existence of these county courts is possibly one reason why county government has continued to play any kind of role at all in many parts of the country where the importance of county governmental functions has steadily declined . This is particularly true in the New England states , where , without the court function , the counties would become little more than geographical units . justices of the Peace A perennial problem of state judicial administration is the justice of the peace . The office of the J.P. , as he is often called , is older than the common law . In the United States there are thousands of these officers , who are usually laymen without legal training . As a rule , too , they are elective officials within a minor civil jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps they are best known for their authority and willingness to perform the civil marriage ceremony . But as a rule , they may also try petty civil and criminal cases . And in some states they conduct preliminary hearings in cases of crime and fix bail for appearance in court . J.P . ' s are hard to dispense with because they make quick justice widely available . Justices of the peace are criticized because , being laymen , they are not trained craftsmen of the law . They usually live on a fee basis instead of on a salary , which too frequently takes the blindfold off the eyes of justice . They are likely to be politicians first and to have slight regard for the reputation of the judiciary . And they contribute , possibly more than any other factor , to the difficulties of creating an integrated , consistent court structure in the states . Because of the J.P . ' s usefulness in many directions , however , it would seem wiser to reform this institution than to abolish it . SPECIAL TRIBUNALS TO RELIEVE THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may wish they were . The products of a highly specialized training , they can not expect to deal successfully with the wide range of problems confronting the modern community . When they do attempt it , society may be the loser because of unintentional shortsightedness or a too close regard for a socially obsolete rule . For these reasons , therefore , and because most judges are aware of their limitations in certain fields , there has been a tendency to create special courts for special purposes . Desirable as they may be , they nevertheless complicate the problem of judicial organization and administration . The principal examples of specialized courts are the following : Juvenile courts and domestic relations courts . These courts deal with the  |p487  intricate problems of family life including orphanage , adoption , juvenile delinquency , divorce , and dependency , which are and always have been among society 's most difficult problems . Often these problems can not be solved by the application of strict legal formulas and procedures . They require a sympathy and understanding akin to that found in equity . Specially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a knowledge of welfare activities and social work , are recruited for these special courts . Many of them operate with marked success , but a great many more are needed . Small claims courts . These courts deal with cases where small amounts of money are involved . Because recourse to them is not expensive , they make justice available where otherwise it would be denied . Court of Claims . The most famous claims court is the United States Court of Claims , created in 1855 for the purpose of making recommendations on claims cases and empowered in 1866 to decide cases . It deals only with cases of claims against the federal government , but not with all of them . Through its unified and specialized process it has provided much-needed relief to heavily burdened courts and administrative agencies . Administrative tribunals . The quasi-judicial agencies of the executive branch have already been mentioned ; they will be discussed further in later chapters. ; These agencies , which do an enormous amount of work that would otherwise fall on the courts , include state public utility commissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Federal Communications Commission . Conciliation and arbitration . The business community makes wide use of special bodies of conciliators and arbitrators , usually set up for labor relations purposes in a particular trade or industry . The so-called czar of the suit and cloak industry receives a salary of $25,000 a year ? more than the Chief Justice of the United States . Business finds conciliation and arbitration cheaper , faster , and more likely to safeguard good-will than battles in court . The base of the common law , said Dean Pound , tends constantly to shrink as substitutes are found for formal courts of law . But perhaps this is a good thing . A specialized society requires specialized mechanisms . Until we have strengthened the organization of the still overburdened courts and have enabled them to hear and decide cases with greater dispatch , we should not think of adding to their work . If a court does not take sufficient time in the exercise of these functions , justice may be denied . Overloading the courts , therefore , defeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION The federal court scheme is fairly simple . But in the states , the lines between jurisdictions , especially at the local levels , are confused and certainly not uniform . Two remedies have been suggested . The first is a proposed model system Chatttet 3 6 , " Goccrntnent Rrttrganization. " and Chapter 16 , " Bt , incss and G ttlerontrm ...  |p488  of state courts . The other would combine the state and federal courts into a single system . Proposed Model State System The reform of our state court systems has been the subject of a good deal of study and debate . A plan suggested by the American Judicature Society , outlining a model court structure for the states , describes a system which would seem to be both simple and workable : Court of Appeals Supreme Court Division Other divisions : three judges each Superior Court Territorial divisions County Court Territorial divisions Metropolitan Courts ( Combining superior and county courts in metropolitan areas . ) Under this plan , the entire framework would be called the General Court of Judicature and would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago or the British system created under the Judicature Act of 1873 . There is much to recommend it in simplicity of organization , dispatch of procedure , and economy of operation . Should the Dual System of Federal and State Courts Be Combined ? Another reform proposal that has been widely considered by leading authorities on judicial administratio , including Professor W. F. Willoughby , would combine the state and federarcourts into a single system . Under this plan , the federal courts would deal exclusively with appeal cases , with cases involving federal power , and with those entrusted to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States . All other cases of original jurisdiction would be left to the state courts . It is true that at present there is much duplication of jurisdiction between federal and state courts . Frequently an attorney can decide whether to take his case to a state court or , by invoking the " diversity of citizenship " provision ( where the parties are from different states ) , to place it before a federal district court . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdictions ; certainly there is a choice as between judges . The decision he makes , therefore , is an important one . It is also true that our present dual system divides authority , complicates the administration of justice , and adds considerably to the expense of judicial administration . I1 we were starting out afresh , would we favor a dual system of courts ? It is not a necessary adjunct to a federal form of government . Germany prior  |p489  to World War II was a federal government in which the national courts confined themselves to appeal cases and those involving national power . Canadian courts operate under a similar system today . In the United States , a separate federal judiciary contributed greatly to the growth of national power , but this power has now been securely established . If a single court organization for the United States were thought desirable , there are two main alternatives . Either we could extend the federal court system down into the states , thus virtually eliminating the state courts , or we could allow the states to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal district courts ? thus separating jurisdictions and dividing the work load . As between the two , most people would probably prefer a division of the load . For one thing , this would lighten the burden on the federal judiciary which is now so busy with the flood of cases coming from the regulatory and administrative tribunals ? such as the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Communications Commission ? that the assumption of more work without an extension of the court system would seem unthinkable . Why not , therefore , turn over all common law cases and those involving federal power to the state judiciaries ? This would confine the federal courts to the most important questions of constitutional law and administrative regulation . The proposal is worthy of serious thought , although it hardly seems likely that so drastic a measure could become a reality at any time in the near future . Principles Applicable to Judicial Organization and Administration This chapter has tried to indicate something of the great diversity in the state judicial establishments and their practices . In trying to discover some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the application of formulas that may serve well in populous states but prove impractical in less populous ones . In an excellent article entitled " The General Structure of Court Organization , " 1 Professor Charles Grove Haines has suggested the important factors which should be emphasized . He places first the need for flexible constitutional provisions governing court organization . In this respect the provisions of the federal Constitution at present are superior to those of most of the state constitutions . Next , Professor Haines would like to see statutory and constitutional provisions making possible a certain degree of centralization and general administrative control in the distribution of jurisdiction , the assignment of judges , and the making of rules of procedure . This involves a wider use of masters ( that is , specially qualified persons to collect evidence for the court ) , together footnote4 Charles G. Haines , " The General Structure of Court Organization , " The Annals , 167 ( May , I933 ) , 1-I1 . Reprinted in A. N. Christensen and E. M. Kirkpatrick , The People , Polities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judicial assistants , in order to dispose of the preliminary business before the trial stage is reached . This is a system which has been used with great success in England . Third , there should be flexible administrative arrangements to permit specialized treatment in cases where peculiar techniques and methods are indicated , as in municipal courts , family relations , and commercial arbitration . In our court system there is now a clear need for flexibility in organization and procedure to meet the demands of an urbanized and industrialized society where change affects the judicial establishment . as surely as it does the legislative and administrative branches . " These formulas , " says Professor Haines , " can be carried out with a limited amount of central supervision and control , and with the placing of greater responsibilities on local communities for the conduct of judicial administration . " In an understandable desire to correct the looseness and complexity of our present judicial methods , we must not swing too far toward what Professor Laski has characterized as " the inherent vice of centralized authority . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of the judicial branch of government as consisting merely of judges and courts . It is much more than that . The administrative personnel in the judiciary far outnumbers the judges . There are police officials , sheriffs , coroners , clerks , and a host of others who will be discussed in a later chapter . ' For the present , however , it will help to round out the picture if the principal instrumentalities of justice , other than the courts , as suggested by W. F. Willoughby , are listed here : i Adjuncts to the Court System 1 . The chief executive , in the exercise of his constitutional duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed 2 . The Department of Justice or Office of Attorney General 3 . The Office of States Attorney or Prosecuting Attorney 4 . The police or constabulary 5 . The grand jury 6 . The office of coroner 7 . The penal institutions 8 . Special agencies such as public defenders , public trustees , and so on . Diversity of Law and Complexity of Organization Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the law in the country , and several titles are already complete . The reason for this project was the wide diversity in the law of the forty-eight states and the federal government . It is as though there were that many separate bodies of common law in the United States , in addition to the law of the footnote ' Chaff to SI , " Thr Cnnunnnit ' . ti.iL t ? , and Srial Pncir.nment. "  |p491  federal system . In the field of contracts , for example , there are two competing rules ? the New York rule and the Massachusetts rule ? both of which stemmed originally from the English . The Western states have adopted one rule or the other , depending on whether New York or Massachusetts settlers had the greater influence in the new community . The conflict of laws is a subject which has become a leading course in many of our law schools . " In the economic order of today , " says Dean Pound , " unity and harmony are necessary in law and administration , whereas a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today state lines rarely coincide with economic lines . " Dean Pound argues that a regime of local legal units , pulling in different directions , is " wasteful . " A course on the Conflict of Laws attempts , therefore , to tell us what the rule is when a problem cuts across state lines . So long as there are significant doctrinal differences in the law , the problem of administrative simplification must surely be complicated . In the law , as in many other fields , we run into the question of what we are willing to pay for greater efficiency . How high a price will we pay in return for the right to be different ? The reconciliation of liberty and efficiency is common to all basic problems . The Human Factor in Law Law is much more than a matter of organization and rules , as essential as both of these are . Law deals with living things , with human beings . Therefore some pertinent questions arise in the administration of the law . For example , how much popular influence should be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Pound tells us that " as to trial by jury , it may be admitted that the civil jury seems to be slowly dying out in England while signs that it is moribund are not wanting in America . " Are civil liberties growing weaker and is popular vigilance lagging ? These questions will be the subject of the chapter to follow . But there is another human problem which also ties in closely with the administrative problems we have been considering . " The use to which judicial machinery is directed , " says Professor Max Radin , " will always depend on the persons who direct it . " A chapter on law as a career , therefore , follows the one on civil liberties and concludes this section of the book . SUPPLEMENTARY READING 1 . Court structure : The best general reference is C.

And freedom is by no means the result of a simple formula , for both the planning and the execution of the conditions to assure its continuance require the highest kind of social intelligence . All the principal factors in our common life , and nothing less than these , must be brought together to produce the desired resul. , the setting in which freedom may exist . There is , first of all , a physical basis of security and contentment that is indispensable . Men at all periods of time have been more willing to work together peaceably when well-fed , and to drift into violence when their stomachs are pinched . Men are law-abiding and confident when they feel secure , and conspiratorial and rebellious when convinced of deep-seated injustices which could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect the liberties of others more highly , and are prepared to defend them more actively , if they have had to struggle to win or to hold the liberties they themselves possess . If the underlying sentiment of the community is one of equality and respect for human personality , and if it is reinforced by social , economic , political , and religious tradition , then the factors conducing to the security of our civil liberties appear in their proper relationships . OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES Our freedoms , like our law , are a composite of custom and formally prescribed guarantees . Our freedoms rest on community understandings , some of which are formally incorporated into constitutions or rest on legal decisions . But many of our freedoms also depend on a sense of fairness and equality evolving through custom . Ultimately , both kinds endure only when they are and remain a part of the mental and emotional fabric of a people . Although the temper of a people is controlling , the rights that are written down and the power of the courts to enforce them give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty is threatened in concrete instances , it is the judges , relying on written statements of right , who must maintain society 's balance and rebuff the forces of intolerance . This is why a leading authority on American government has said , " No one can understand clearly the status of individual liberty in this country without bearing in mind the place occupied by the judiciary under our constitutional system . " 1 1 J. Allen Smith , The Growth and Decadence of Contlitu/ional Governrnen/ ( New York , llolt , 1930 ) , Chapter 14.  |p494  This chapter will attempt to define and classify civil liberties , and will discuss them as they appear in the provisions of the federal and state constitutions . Civil Liberties Defined Civil liberties are the basic rights of men and women in a free society . They are positive , as exemplified by freedom of speech , assembly , petition , and press . They are protective , limiting the threatened aggressions of public agencies or private individuals , as illustrated by the requirement that private property may not be taken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are protected by law and the courts . In a real and comprehensive sense , civil liberties are the natural rights to which public opinion agrees all men and women are entitled . This is not a simple definition . The difficulty is that if it emphasizes only a limited aspect of civil liberties , the resulting definition is incomplete and misleading . From a purely legal standpoint it would be correct to say that civil liberties are the " personal and property rights guaranteed by constitutions and laws against infractions by governments and individuals . " But civil liberties are more than that . They are what tradition says they are ; they are what public opinion succeeds in enforcing . Civil Liberties Have Roots in the Past The Greeks believed that no man should be condemned without trial . The Romans felt just s strongly that no man should be condemned to death for the murder of another without a trial by his peers . Men in all ages have recognized certain immunities of the individual and certain procedural and substantive rights to be thrown about him for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fairness but there was also the fear of encountering dangers oneself . At times ? as in the case of the Twelve Tables in Rome or legislative enactments in both Greece and Rome ? these rights were written down . In time of conflict between rival forces , they were almost sure to be . The great documents of English constitutional history are examples of the writing down of basic rights . When King John was forced to assent to Magna Carta in 1215 , that document referred to the lex terrae ( law of the land ) ? rights which preceded the advent of kings and which the people now proposed to make express . Magna Carta pledged the king to refrain from certain clearly arbitrary acts . In addition it forbade the sale of justice , and stipulated that no man should be deprived of his property , or imprisoned , or banished without the llegal judgment of his peers and in accordance with the law of the land . Two other great documents of English liberty which became part of our common heritage also grew out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill of Rights . Both were written during the seventeenth century , which saw the overthrow of royal authority by the Parliament . The Petition of Right was signed in 1628 by Charles I , very much against his will . It pro-  |p495  hibited the billeting of soldiers in people 's homes , the trial of offenders by martial law , the collection of loans or taxes not sanctioned by Parliament , and the imprisonment of any person without specific charge and orderly trial . Here again , as in the case of Magna Carta , customary or inherent rights were relied on , rather than newly established ideals . The third great charter of liberty was the Bill of Rights signed in 1689 , when , it will be recalled , James II had been deposed and William and Mary were brought to the throne as figureheads . With the supremacy of Parliament finally established , another cataloguing of traditional rights seemed appropriate . Its most important provisions were the denial of royal authority to dispense with any law ; the affirmation of the right to petition the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing armies in peacetime without Parliamentary consent ; the denunciation of excessive bail in criminal cases ; and the requirements that elections to Parliament be free from royal control or influence , that they occur frequently , and that the members of Parliament have complete freedom of speech and debate in that body . Added together , these civil rights make an imposing list . They became our inheritance . Many were written into our state and federal bills of rights . To these , notably in state constitutions , we have added special provisions of our own . BILLS OF RIGHTS EMBODIED IN OUR CONSTITUTIONS The American practice of embodying a section on civil liberties in the constitutional frame of our governments ? where rights can be changed only by the difficult method of constitutional amendment ? was one of our distinctive contributions to government . The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and our own Bill of Rights set an example which has been followed by most of the subsequent framers of constitutions . The fact that a right is written down in a constitution , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at some later date . Constitutions themselves may be scrapped . The provisions of the bill of rights in the Weimar Constitution , for example , were extensive and enlightened , but when the liberal government succumbed to the Nazi dictatorship , the bill of rights became as meaningless as the rest of the document . Constitutional provisions and judicial safeguards relating to bills of rights , therefore , are a bulwark but not an absolute guarantee of inviolability . Ultimately if public opinion weakens and popular government fails , then no formal sanctions will suffice . What are the rights guaranteed us by the Constitution of the United States ? It will be recalled that a Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution by amendment after it had been framed . It is a simple statement , however , and nowhere near as extensive as in most of the state constitutions . The first ten amendments to the Constitution comprise the Bill of Rights . The first eight amendments deal exclusively with the rights and immunities of persons . The Ninth makes it clear that no complete enumeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
