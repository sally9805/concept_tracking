Hitler 's dismissal of von Brauchitsch and his as ? sumption of command of the army , combined with the warnings by Goebbels that this is going to be a long , hard war in which Germany may not always be top dog , have started rumors that Germany is cracking and speculations that she may not be able to carry on a major campaign this winter . That something had to be done about morale in the Reich is not a surprise . The people had accepted the war but have never been enthusiastic about it ; reliable reports indicate that they are suffering from weariness under the long strain and have been shocked by the terrific losses on the eastern front . Combine these influ ? ences with the obvious facts that the promises to win this year are unfulfilled , the campaign against the Soviet Union has failed , costly defeats have been suffered in Africa and the United States has entered the war , and you have sufficient explanation for the shift in com ? mand and the efforts to prepare opinion for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow these developments to influence our vigor in prosecution of the war . It is just as true as when Adam Smith said it a century and a half ago that " there is a lot of ruin in a nation . " Hitler 's production of weapons is still superior to that of the Allies , and he is in command of millions of well trained effectives . The nearer to desperation he is , the harder he will try to retrieve his fortunes . Even if Germany were cracking it would be our cue to deal her the strongest possible blows . The mistakes made in drafting an army of 2,000 , - 000 men , between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-eight , can not be repeated in drafting one of 6,000,000 or more , between twenty and forty-four . There is now far more danger of taking for military service those who are indispensable in civilian life . There is also greater danger that persons with special skills will not be sifted into the appropriate military duties . It was relatively harmless , when the selectees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to pick a man here and there who might better have been left at home , or not to make the best use of the men taken . Now more care must be exercised . It is a question whether , under these circumstances , local draft boards should be given as wide a discretion as they have had heretofore . One point at which much better performance is necessary is in the medical examination of selectees , especially on the psychiatric side . Even epileptics and psychotics have not , in some cases , been sifted out . And it is reported that hospitals are rapidly filling up with severe cases of neuroses from the camps , suscepti ? bility to which might have been discovered through relatively brief examination by trained psychiatrists . Veterans ' hospitals have for years harbored many thou ? sands of victims of war neurosis , each of whom , it is estimated , has cost the government an average of $30 , ? 000 . Prompt attention to this problem is indispensable . The same cautions apply to any use which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the interruption of our supply of crude rubber from the Netherlands Indies , strict rationing is the only possible course . But the rationing calls for the utmost possible intelligence , and new sources of supply must be made ready at the earliest moment , if this one is not quickly regained . We still have a hangover from the period when automobiles were re ? garded as a luxury . As a matter of fact , an America without tires for civilians would be an America with production cut in half . There is , for many millions of workers , no other means of transportation between their homes and their assembly lines . Farmers can not conduct their business or reach their markets without tires . Nor can doctors see their patients . And rubber is required for hundreds of essential uses , aside from these , of which we seldom think . It is as much a staple of our life as bread or iron . Unless we are greatly mistaken , rationing of rubber for civilians can not go on very long without rationing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useless , no matter how well equipped , unless supplies could reach them . The authorities should at once make sure that neither is tying up more of this precious com ? modity than it actually needs . We could not afford , for instance , to fill great storehouses full of rubber goods , as we did in the last war with shoes , blankets and other supplies , that the army could not possibly use in a decade . As the retreat in Libya continues we watch the names of the German-evacuated coastal towns flick past like the floor numbers in a falling elevator ? Bardia , To ? bruk , Derna , Apollonia , Bengazi . At such a time we should turn from the fanfare of the headlines to con ? sider the less obvious moves made in the same area by both sides in the past few weeks . The Germans are pouring through Bengazi , presumably headed for Age ? dabia and Tripoli : this reminds us of the flying col ? umn of Imperial troops which , in the opening days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agheila , some two hundred miles south of Bengazi . Was it sent only to harry Rommel 's reinforcements coming from Tripoli , or was it strategically placed with enough force to block just such a retreat as is now in progress ? Has it been in contact with the British cruisers and destroyers recently reported by Rome to be present in the Gulf of Sidra ? These are questions which will probably be answered soon ; there remain others which belong to a more distant future . One con ? cerns the rumor of a few weeks back concerning the Vichy Minister of War 's trip to Tunisia . He had been sent there , it was said , to see if French forces along the border of eastern Tunisia were strong enough to delay a British drive to the west until reinforced by the Germans . And if such a plan is in the offing we are left with another question , perhaps the most serious of all : have the British sinkings of Axis supplies in the Mediterranean made it impossible for the Axis to or ? ganize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Africa via Spain and Gibraltar ? It is of the highest importance that any continuing source of hard feeling between the United States and our Latin American neighbors should be swept away . A few weeks ago , we made an agreement with Mexico which in principle removed one of the most trouble ? some of these questions , the matter of payment to the American owners of oil and mining properties which were confiscated by Mexico 's government under the terms of her constitution . It remains to determine the amounts of money involved . To this end , President Roosevelt has just appointed Morris Llewellyn Cooke as American expert to cooper ? ate with a Mexican representative in regard to the value of petroleum properties . The choice is an excel ? lent one . Mr. Cooke is a widely known engineer , of broad interests , who has served the government use ? fully in a whole series of posts going all the way back to the last war . ( New Republic readers know him as a frequent contributor to our pages on problems of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put very large valuations on their former properties in Mexico . Figures as high as $400,000,000 are some ? times mentioned . We should not be at all surprised to find , when an examination is made of the books of the companies , which were impounded by the Mexican government at the time the properties were seized , that the actual investment in Mexico is a great deal smaller . Some reports suggest that it may be only I0 or i 5 percent as large . In any case , the country can now look forward confidently to an end of this long continuing dispute across the border . On the surface the agreement between the United States and Martinique on the West Indian island 's neu ? trality looks like a continuation of the State Depart ? ment 's discredited policy of appeasement . There are , however , some distinctions to be noted . Not the State Department but the Navy Department negotiated the agreement , and one may assume that practical consid ? erations of strategy rather than of dubious diplomacy were uppermost . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Hitler 's thumb . Admiral Robert may be a Petain man , but geography and the American navy put Martinique at our mercy , not Hitler 's . The only alternative to accepting Martinique 's neu ? trality was blockade and an expeditionary force . The victory would unquestionably go to us , but in the fight ? ing we would lose men and materials urgently needed elsewhere . Obviously the navy ought to keep a sharp eye on Martinique , a precaution that we hope can be taken for granted . In addition , pressure should be brought for the release of those 25o planes which have been held on the island ever since France collapsed . We need all the planes we can get . Byron Price , formerly executive news editor of the Associated Press , undertakes a tremendous responsi ? bility in becoming Director of Censorship . He must see to it that as little information as possible that is useful to the enemy is disseminated by the press , the radio , or any other means of communication . At the same time , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the information about our war effort on which helpful national self-criticism can be based . It would have been tragic , for example , if the govern ? ment had tried to conceal indefinitely the amount of damage at Pearl Harbor instead of facing the facts and removing the military commanders in charge of opera ? tions at that point . We are told that the new censorship will be partly mandatory and partly voluntary , which should go without saying . The , overwhelming major ? ity of all American periodicals , radio stations and other media for communication are eager to do what they can to help their country win the war . Mistakes on both sides are more likely to be caused by overzealousness than anything else . We take it for granted that Mr. Price will welcome fair-minded and reasonable criticism of his activities when and if it seems necessary . The New Republic , for one , will do its best to supply criti ? cism of that type . As in World War I , a number of colleges in various parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through summer sessions and other devices , they hope to give four years ' work in three . The curricula are also being modified to keep up with the problems that war has brought . These are both moves in the right direction . Long before the war began , the colleges had been criticized for their lei ? surely tempo , a charge that some of them had met by introducing the four-quarter system . Even though the same members of the faculty and student body are not continuously in residence , there is no good reason why this tremendous physical plant of our educational sys ? tem should stand idle one-fourth of the time . As things are going , it seems likely that for some time to come a large proportion of the normal body of undergradu ? ates will be in the armed forces of the United States before reaching the customary age for graduation . There is every reason for giving them as much of the entire academic course as is possible , before they go . New Yorkers visiting Washington these past six months have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big city . The noise , the confusion , the inability to get a hotel room , the crazy traffic , the packed bars made New Yorkers sigh , " Washington is a fine place to visit , but it 's no place to live . " Last week the White House reached a similar conclusion and announced that by July , 1942 , some 40,000 federal employees are to be sent out of the capital . An initial batch of 1,400 are to come here , and we extend a somewhat timid hand of friendship . New York is much as it has been for years and years . Except when Mayor LaGuardia goes on the air , we do n't hear a great deal about our city 's relation to the war . Wall Street at high noon is quieter than Pennsylvania Avenue at midnight . Cabinet members and dollar-a ? year men are seldom to be seen in our hotel lobbies . Our autograph-seekers are compelled to put up with a few movie stars straggling in from Hollywood . We are a pastoral people , linked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press and the radio and thus lit ? tle different from Helena , Montana , ' or Paducah , Ken ? tucky . But once they get used to the quiet , the Wash ? ington refugees may like our little town . The Chamber of Commerce will do its best to make them happy . The traditional holiday observances were something of an anti-climax , since everyone understood perfectly that a new year and a new era had begun on Decem ? ber 7 , beating the calendar by three weeks , and that it was a page that would never be turned back . Those who received Torchy Perfume , Triple Threat Glamor Stockings or Readinjacks , the clever Christmas gift for a convalescent if he is recovering from a cold or loves to read in bed , looked upon them with unaccus ? tomed affection , wondering how much that sort of thing would be missed next year . Those who received home-made sweaters which wrapped the back of their necks in three wrinkles of wool and did n't come down to their stomachs in front felt kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one former member of the The New Republic 's staff came in with a beard , like a lovely red balloon , slightly frayed . Many even experienced a changed attitude toward Christmas cards . The process of working the new idea of national unity into a recognizable shape went along in the ex ? pected manner . Mr. Willkie said sensible things about the necessity of increased production , along with a foolish taunt at the administration for having " spent our substance in public expenditures , " instead of build ? ing planes , ships and tanks nine years ago . Mr. Willkie , being human , is still thinking about that Southern and Commonwealth affair . Most of his fellow citizens , when they think of it , are thankful that the resources of Tennessee power are being expended for public , rather than private advantage . . . . " Heptisax , " who writes a Sunday letter for The New York Herald Tribune which expresses the furthest reach of the Re ? publican mind , explained that President Roosevelt 's approach to big problems is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop playing politics . The official Repub ? lican line is apparently to be that anything which does go wrong on land or sea this year is the result of politics . A T THE START of the new year we are deep in war . We have felt the losses of war ; we recognize that there will be no easy victory . In another two years we may come to rely on our superiority in weapons ; today we must rely on strength of spirit as Britain did when she rose to her finest hour . We can not turn to hope of initial success . Immediate success may come , but we must not count on it This year may be one of the hardest of all years to face , not for lack of food or shelter , though we must lack many comforts , but for the lack of any vision of victory which success could bring . Every day our endurance will be tested by doubts and discouragements . We shall see our families broken up , our security destroyed , our friends lost ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we shall come to know what it means to live in fear . At every moment , our courage and our patience will be on trial . As the war sets in , and the going becomes heavy , voices will rise in America to exploit our hardships . They will offer an end to the war by compromise , and though they offer an end , not to the war , but to life itself , their voices will be heard . In this year many of our men may be scattered throughout the world , fighting wherever democracy fights , relying on our store of common experience to sustain our will . More than ever , we shall need a sense of a binding force ; we shall want new rules to live by in wartime . For 1942 The New Republic offers six such rules : x . W e must never underestimate the enemy . ? Every disaster that has been suffered in this war stems from underestimation of the Axis . France and Britain under ? estimated Hitler 's ambition ; so France fell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German armies ; so Hitler was freed to crush Norway and Greece . We , in turn , underestimated the scope of German strategy ; so we were caught unprepared . We and the British underestimated the craft of the Japa ? nese ; so today the Pacific is in danger . Still we have not learned the lesson . We are , fighting the cruelest , most ruthless powers cn earth . We must meet , with our armed force , the strongest armed force ever created . We must match with our war effort a nation whose organization for war is immensely superior to our own . Never again must we underestimate its power if we look for victory . 2 . We must never tolerate any barrier to our utmost effort . ? Today there are many such barriers ? barriers of jealousy and fear of executive power in Congress ; of tradition andbureaucracy in the armed forces ; of selfish interesCin industry ; of short-sightedness and incompetence in administration . In all fairness to men whose lives are at stake we can not afford any longer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be vigilant . ? Our rela ? tions with one another demand that we achieve unity ; but it must be formed around ends , not men . We may hope , but we can not assume , that forces which a few weeks ago acted on a belief in the victory of the Axis are now acting in the service of democracy . For a few hours the weight of the disaster which they have brought upon America , and which itself has united our people , has silenced them . But their voices will rise again . In every corner of America we must watch for them and recognize them . 4 . We must never fear our own people . ? " Con ? fusion , indecision fear ? these , " Hitler said , " are my weapons . " Today we are no longer chained by our indecision ; we are ridding ourselves of our confusion ; our fear remains , the last weapon in Hitler 's hands . Fear the growing power of Russia as Hitler is driven back ; fear of our fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn are strengthened . That fear is based , not upon the power of the Ameri ? can Communists , but upon fear of our inability in the future to fulfill the hopes of the American people through our democratic institutions . If by our failure those institutions are discredited , then the American people will find their own solutions in their own ways . Once we fear our own people , then all hope of victory dies . 5 . We must never compromise the principles for which we fight. ? These equalitarian and libertarian principles are our weapons of war without which we shall never win . Because the peace that follows victory will be determined not by the principles which we have lived by in the past , but by those which govern our actions at the war 's end , they must be kept in force throughout the conflict . 6 . We must never lose faith in ultimate victory . ? For the peoples of all the world , America 's entry into war has meant the end of all doubts of the coming victory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomparable resources . They know that these resources , of youth , of will and of materials are so great that whatever initial mistakes we make , what ? ever defeats we suffer , we have the power , if we use it , to win the war .
