The gas company of Gardner , Mass , ( pop . 20,397 ) has a shiny new truck , a new office on the town square at the corner of Vernon and Parker Streets . It also has a new president and owner : comfortable , pipe-smoking Harold Emerson Greenwood . More than all these it has a new legend for thrifty Gardner folk : how 45-year-old " Bob " Greenwood bought the whole works-the silvered storage tank , the grimy plant down by the Boston &; Maine tracks , the mains connecting with 800-odd Gardner homes . <P> Last week Gardner people who cook with gas were able to hear the legend firsthand . They heard it from Bob Greenwood , who had taken over a job that few public utility presidents ever thought of adding to their administrative duties . <P> With a flashlight stuffed in his coat pocket , he set forth to read meters . His objects : 1 ) to save expenses , 2 ) to get closer touch with the customers of Gardner Gas , Fuel &; Light Co . <P> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gardner Electric Light Co. has been slowly running the gas company out of business . But big New England Power Association felt bound to keep the gas company going because it also owned the light company and wanted to keep everybody 's good will . To keep it going , N. E. P. A. poured $297,700 into the gas company . Its gross fell from $76,439 for 1930 to $37,215 last year , and its annual net deficit ranged between $8,464 and $17,834 . <P> Popeyed and incredulous was Bob Greenwood when New England sought him out six months ago and offered a deal : the whole works for $1 , with a king 's ransom in debt ( $388,427 including interest ) completely wiped out , no strings attached . How New England happened to pick him , Bob Greenwood says he still does not know . But townspeople can guess : onetime furniture manufacturer , onetime chairman of the town Public Service Committee , Bob Greenwood was about as popular a businessman as there was in Gardner , and had had no steady job of late . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. asked approval of the deal . He was on the witness stand for seven hours convincing the Public Utilities Division that he had nothing up his sleeve , was no stooge for N. E. P. A. <P> " How long Greenwood will be able to continue the operations of the company is conjectural , " wrote SEC in giving its doubtful blessing to the sale . <P> But sanguine new President Greenwood did not see how he could lose . For in addition to the physical assets of the plant , which have a possible salvage value of around $11,000 , he has also taken over $11,715 in quick assets-$6,324 in cash , the rest in receivables , materials , prepaid accounts . If gross could be increased , debt-free Gardner Gas might yet become a fair moneymaker for its president , his five employes . To do that , Bob Greenwood had an idea on which ( between meters ) he worked last week . He went looking for off-main customers in the country who might buy bottled gas for cooking , to be delivered by Gardner Gas 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
