Representatives of eight Atlantic , Pact nations emerged from a two-hour-and-20-minute conference and stepped into a reception room on the fifth floor of the U.S. State Department , as pleased and smiling as though they had delivered a bouncing , 8-lb. boy . The Belgian ambassador , Baron Silvercruys , gave out a verbal bulletin : " It 's all fine , agreed and everything . " <P> All of the home governments had been informed of the text of the agreement , and all were believed ready to sign . Publication of the text was held up until this week , while the French went through some last-minute formalities in Paris . Foreign ministers of the eight* ( plus Denmark , Italy and Iceland , possibly Portugal ) were expected in Washington for signing ceremonies early in April . <P> Denmark 's Foreign Minister Gustav Rasmussen arrived in Washington , and was closeted with Secretary of State Dean Acheson , who told him the facts of life as related to peace for the Atlantic community-and also , probably , gave him an estimate of what Denmark could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week , Iceland 's Foreign Minister Bjarni Benediktsson arrived for a similar briefing . <P> The treaty will go into effect , for 20 years , when a majority of the signers have ratified . The framers of the pact labeled it a defensive alliance , permitted by Article 51 of the U.N . Charter . Western Europe had been eager to learn the extent of U.S. military commitment , in case one or more of the pact nations should be attacked by " an aggressor . " The commitment ( Article Five ) provides that if one or more of the treaty nations should be attacked by an aggressor , each of the others will , individually or collectively , take whatever measures it deems necessary against the aggressor " including the use of armed force . " <P> It might be said ( and undoubtedly would be ) that this was only a " moral " commitment . But since there exists no supranational agency capable of enforcing commitments by sovereign states , all treaties rest on moral commitments . The European nations seemed to be satisfied-and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearmament of the Atlantic Pact nations is not included in the pact 's terms , but such aid will go forth as part of the same moral bundle . The Administration bill aimed at Congress includes Greece , Turkey and some Latin American states , as well as the Atlantic nations . Estimated overall cost to the U.S. ( in addition to Marshall Plan economic aid ) : $1.5 to $2 billion . The cost-and the risk-of the pact was more than balanced by the feeling of Western cohesion , the assurance that peace of the Atlantic community was indivisible .
