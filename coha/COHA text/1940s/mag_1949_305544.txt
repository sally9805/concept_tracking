With other moneyed political innocents ( and some toughened professionals ) , he plunged eagerly into the Fusion movement which made Fiorello La Guardia mayor of New York in 1934 . The Little Flower made him his secretary , later gave him a couple of city posts , until the two reformers had a falling out in 1940 . <P> Noisy &; Hopeful . Not until two months ago did Clen Ryan return to New York politics . This time his entry was noisy and his ambitions were high ; he might even be a mayor-maker again . <P> Ryan dumped $500,000 into something he called the National Foundation for Good Government . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He railed at Governor Tom Dewey for not investigating Mayor Bill O'Dwyer 's administration . He trotted down to City Hall with ten questions for O'Dwyer . Their substance : Is Slot Machine Tycoon Frankie Costello the real boss of New York City ? <P> Bill O'Dwyer contemptuously snorted " crackpot . " Ryan was undismayed . He chirped back : " A question a day might keep Costello away . " The next morning , resplendent in pearl-grey Homburg , Ryan was back at City Hall . This time he nailed to the front door of the Hall photostats of some old ( and generally discredited ) grand jury charges that O'Dwyer had been grossly lax as district attorney of Brooklyn . Ryan happily held every pose the photographers yelled for , withdrew the nail , and went away . <P> The Wild Plot . Then the pros-Bill O'Dwyer and Tammany Hall-looked Clen up &; down without great passion , spit on their hands and went to work . Before they were even half through they had made Clen Ryan look bad . In the dead of night Bill O'Dwyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiretapping story to hit the town since Justice Aurelio was overheard thanking Frankie Costello for his nomination ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) . <P> A jaunty , 6 ft. ex-city detective and wiretapping expert named Kenneth Ryan ( no kin to Clen ) had been picked up . The mayor himself had broken him down in his City Hall office ; $10,000 worth of telephone and tapping equipment had been found in the detective 's Yonkers home . A plot was afoot , said O'Dwyer , to listen in on the telephones of several score of city officials ( including his ) and some big wheels in the Midwest . A prominent someone had given Ryan $100,000 to do it . <P> At 7 that morning , after long questioning , Tapper Ryan asked permission to use a ladies ' washroom near the mayor 's office . Leaving his hat and coat on a chair , the tap expert beat it out a back window of City Hall and got clean away . While the cops bayed after him , Mayor O'Dwyer brought in the " someone " named by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private eye named John Broady , who , as it happens , works for none other than do-gooder Clendenin John Ryan and years before had gathered evidence for Ryan 's annulment from the Countess Marie Anne Wurmbrand-Stuppach.
