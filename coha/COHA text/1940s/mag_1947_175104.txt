In the Mayflower Hotel 's gilt-trimmed ballroom , the cheers and applause were unrestrained . There were even a few joyous rebel yells as Harry Truman appeared in the doorway , flanked by Mrs. Truman ( in green ) and Daughter Margaret ( in pale blue ) . Harry Truman grinned and waved happily to the 2,000-odd Jefferson Day diners. * He could well remember the dismal days last fall , when all that Democrat bigwigs wanted of him was to keep out of sight . <P> Fresh in every mind was the cheering news of the Democratic comeback in Chicago ( see Political Notes ) ; the thought gave added zest to the diners as they pitched in to their $100-a-plate dinner . Over coffee and cigars , Gael Sullivan , the Democrats ' national executive director , served up the main political fare . Said he : " In front of us today we have a leader-tested and triumphant .

Last week , stuffed with terrapin soup , lobster newburg and filet mignon , Democrats nodded approvingly . <P> Top Subject . Harry Truman did not let them down . His speech brought cheers and applause between nearly every paragraph . He started where he was strongest - with a firm restatement of the Truman Doctrine and a rawhiding of Russia without ever , mentioning her by name . Then , as the head of a political party speaking at a purely political dinner , he launched into politics . <P> He seized the chance to announce officially that the 1947 fiscal budget will be balanced , and even show a surplus . " That , " he said , " was done without any Republican help .

" When a man is earning good wages ... he is wise if he uses his excess income to pay off his debts . He would be shortsighted if he cut his income just because he was not spending it all at the moment . " <P> The President was feeling his oats . For the first time since last November , he was , politically speaking , on the attack . <P> <P> * Conspicuous among the guests were Florida 's Senator Claude Pepper and Elliott Roosevelt , frequent Truman critics . Conspicuously absent : Henry Wallace . A few hours before dinner time , he had left town for New York , explaining that he was too busy getting ready for his departure this week for Europe .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
