The U.S. Communist Party , often surprised by the turns of history , had another little surprise last week . <P> The Party had ganged up on the Book-of-the-Month Club 's choice for May , Mark Aldanov 's novel The Fifth Seal ( Scribner 's ; $3 ) . The Daily Worker opened the attack with a letter demanding that the club withdraw the novel as " subtly and viciously anti-Soviet . " Then the machinery started turning whereby the Party gets a wide assortment of innocent bystanders and fellow travelers to forward the assassination . Labor unions , civic groups and authors received unsigned memorandums , urging protests ; many obliged . Protests were made by Sculptor Jo Davidson , Artist Rockwell Kent , Poet Alfred Kreymborg , Poetess Genevieve Taggard . They were joined by many simpler admirers of the Russians who frankly admitted that they had not read the novel . <P> The Communist campaign progressed nicely until last week , when the B.O.M . Club suddenly gave the New York World-Telegram the club's-eye view of the gang-up . The club revealed , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sent a telegram to Jane Benedict , president of the protesting Book and Magazine Union . Said Mr. Morley : " Assume principal objection is to chapter where Commissar Dlugash , Georgian renegade , makes his burlesque of Stalin . " Miss Benedict wired back : " Other passages equally objectionable as one you mention . " The curious thing was that The Fifth Seal contained no such episode . <P> Poet William Rose Bent and Authoress Marcia Davenport said they had read the novel in galley proofs , and denounced the " political " campaign . In no time at all the Communist drive to suppress The Fifth Seal had turned into a fine publicity boom .
