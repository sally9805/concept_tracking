' Yes . 1 ) o you knew him ? ' I nut . him once , ' he told her . Quinton was almost fat , almost bald , almost middle-aged ; and Harland wondered what common ground these two could have found . We were both fishing the Upsal ( luitch . IIe came downstream , stopped to eat lunch , then went on . ' Quinton had been in ill-humor that day , and Harland had not liked the man , had not liked what Leick afterward told him about Quinton . ' Ile was a friend of my father 's , ' she said , and father liked him , and Mr. Quinton wished we might be engaged . But I will never marry him . ' Harland felt his heart quicken , as a horse quickens at the faint warning touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paid for a moment no attention to the movement far up the canyon . Something , probably some of Robie 's cattle , had drifted out of the shadows of the trees into the sunned open there , but he hardly saw them . Iler quiet words had carried an astonishing impact . She wore Quinton 's ring  --  but she would never marry him ! A turbulence possessed Harland , but then he realized that those cattle up the canyon were very dark , almost black ; and as his eyes and his mind focussed upon them , he said in a low whisper : I see turkeys ! ' She did not move , still watching him . How far away ? ' she asked . Quarter of a mile at least . They 're so big I thought t hey were cattle . ' From the corner of his eye he saw her head turn , very slowly , till she too could look that way . Big gobblers , ' she said then . Six of them . ' One of the tremendous birds made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured : ' at citing grasshoppers . They 'll work down this way . Be very still . Co111plctely still . ' Harland obeyed her , and they lay motionless , watching theslowly approaching birds . Now and then she whispered some word almost soundlessly ; and he answered , hardly moving his lips , feeling his pulse pound , at once completely conscious of her beside him and yet trembling with the keen tension of this waiting . The turkeys seemed gigantic . Lying prone , looking up the canyon toward them as they approached , Harland 's vision was to some degree distorted , so that the birds appeared to be larger than they were , and very near ; but when at last he slid his gun a little forward , she whispered warningly : No , wait ! Let them come as close as they will . ' And she added : I 'll tell you when to shoot . ' And a little later she said : Watch the one that 's second from the right , now . Take him when you shoot . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eye on him . ' Harland muttered an assent . His hand was tight on his gun and he felt it slipping with sweat and released his grip to wipe his palm dry on his trouser leg . The turkeys , moving straight towardwhere they lay , came within fifty or sixty yards ; but then Harland thought the birds saw them . Certainly he and Ellen were by that time in plain sight , and certainly the actions of the turkeys were subtly modified . They changed course , and instead of coming on they drifted nearer the border of the woods and , keeping the same distance away , described a third of a circle around the two watchers . Harland wished to shoot , but he waited till Ellen whispered : Careful ! Now ! ' He swung the gun 's muzzle slowly toward the birds , and at that cautious movement they stood for an instant in motionless attention . In that instant Harland fired . The turkey he had chosen fell ; the others fled like speeding shadows . As he leaped erect , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running toward it , fired again , knocked it down again . Before he reached it , it was up once more , and once more Harland shot it down . It was still struggling when he caught its neck , smothered the great beating wings , gave it a quick quietus . Leave Her to HeavenAnd he thought then suddenly that his chest was about to explode ! The violent exertion through these few seconds at this high altitude had called on his heart and lungs for an extraordinaryeffort . When Ellen , coming more slowly , reached him , he was lying flat on his back , breathless and helpless , his hand clasping the softly feathered neck of the dead bird . She knelt , beside him , quickly understanding . Just rest ! ' she said . I should have warned you . You 're not acclimated to the thin air . We 're up nine or ten thousand feet here , you know . ' Then she cried , looking at the turkey : Oh , what a pity ! One of your bullets cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Harland , grimly amused at his own distress , thought he himself was in a fair way to become a splendid specimen ! He tried to sit up , but she bade him lie still . Wait , ' she insisted . You 'll be all right presently . ' He did not protest . He was content to stay passive till his laboringheart slowed to a normal beat again ; content even then to sit with her while they admired the big gobbler on the ground between them . Its wingspread was wider than his gun 's length would span , and she guessed the bird would weigh twenty-five pounds . It 's bigger than the best my father killed , ' she said . I 'm sorry the beard 's spoiled . I might have saved the skin and mounted it in the group he made last winter , out of turkeys he killed here . ' Do you still do that sort of thing ? ' I have n't , but I could . I 've kept his workrooms as they were , in Boston and at Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ' Do you mean to  --  go on with his work ? ' Her eyes met his . I do n't know what I mean to do , ' she said quietly . Then with a quick movement she rose . Stay here . I 'll bring the horses . ' ' I 'll go . ' You should n't move around much for a while . ' Her solicitude at once flattered and compelled him , and he felt a momentary rebellion at her assured domination ; but she was already movingLeave Her to Heaven 43away . When she returned , herself mounted and with his horse on lead , under her direction he loosed the yellow slicker bound behind his saddle and wrapped the turkey in it and secured it on the horse 's back . Then they turned homeward , jubilant together , talking much and laughing easily . There was a like intoxication in them both , and every thought was amusing , every word provokeda shout of mirth . On the crest of the last ridge they paused to watch the level sun dip below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like bathers venturing into the sea at night , they descended into the cool dusk which filled the canyon ; and Ellen began to sing a doleful song : Are we almost there ? Are we almost there ? Cried the dying maid , as they drew near her home . Are them the slip-per-y el-lums that r'arTheir proud green forms ' neath Heaven 's blue dome ? ' He laughed in amused appreciation . Where 'd you get that ? ' Charlie Yates taught it to me when father and I were here two years ago . ' It 's a classic ! ' He began to sing it with her , and when he erred she corrected him . Not " slippery elms " ! ' she protested . ' " Slip-per-y el-lums " ! Soulful and woeful ! Try it again . ' So they began afresh , and their singing voices went before them as they neared the lodge , and their shouts of triumph summoned the others out to see their prize.  --  viHarland before he slept that night planned eagerly to spend next day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to go looking for wild horses and he could think of no ready pretext to escape . Tess decided to join them , and shortly after breakfast , lunch in their saddlebags , the others on the veranda to watch their departure , they set out . From the first it was clear that Lin felt himself to be  --  and was  --  in charge of the expedition . Harland found it hard to re-ti44 Leave Her to Heavenmember that Lin was no older than Danny ; the boy seemed so completely at home in these surroundings , so sure of himself , so mature in all his ways . Tess , in dungarees and checked shirt and big hat , wearing leather chaps to guard her knees against the buck brush through which sometimes they rode , seemed as much a boy as Lin ; and they vied with each other like puppies , spurring their horses into sudden headlong races not only on the level but up or down the steep trails , shouting and laughing , the victor deriding the vanquished while after each sprint they waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming , but he wished it were Ellen with whom he rode through these sun-filled canyons and these park-like openingscarpeted with flowers . He might have forgotten their quest , but Lin did not . Whenever they were about to emerge from some forest cover he paused to scan the scene ahead ; and thrice he showed Harland tracks of the quarry upon which they sought to spy . At noon , as efficiently as any guide , he boiled the kettle beside a tumbling little stream , and Harland smiled at the youngster 's gravity , and thought how Danny would have enjoyedthis ( lay , and they ate their lunch and then rode on . It was mid-afternoon before fortune gave them at last the glimpse they sought . Emerging from an aspen thicket into one of the lovely parks which lay everywhere , Harland saw Lin pause to look ahead , and the boy called a low , quick word , and Ilarland and Tess brought their horses up beside his , and then they all spurred into the open . Two hundred yards away , gleaming like bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung high , watching them . As Harland 's eye found them , they turned in thundering flight . The stallion herded his mares away , and Lin shouted and gave chase , and Tess and Harland , at full gallop , followed ; but in a dozen bounds the wild creatures reached the rimrock and plunged over it and were gone . Only the stallion paused for one last defiant backward glance before he followed his harem over the brink . When the riders came to the spot , it seemed impossible that anythinglarger than a fox could have descended the broken declivLeaveHer to Heaven 45ity ; but the horses were gone , already out of sight in the wooded deeps . Did they go down there ? ' Harland cried , doubting his own eyes ; and Lin laughed . Sure . They 're a mile away by now . They 're like mountain goats , and just about as wild . ' He was tremendously proud of this success , and Harland to please him asked many wondering questions , till presently they moved on , now homeward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they emerged upon a tree-clad rim from which they looked out across a high grassy basin perhaps a mile wide . Lin checked his horse in the fringe of trees ; and Harland , pausing beside him , saw three mounted figuressitting quietly in the center of the basin . He recognized at once Robie 's big , light-colored hat , and the two people with him were clearly feminine ; but far away across the basin another rider went at a swinging gallop , describing a circle around these three ; and even at a distance Harland was sure this was Ellen . Tess said in quick dismay : Oh , I did n't know they were coming up here today . Get back , Lin . ' Lin reined his horse among the trees again . They wo n't want us butting in , ' Tess explained , and Harland too retreated ; and for long minutes they stayed there watching , while Ellen rode at a headlong run the circuit of the basin . When she passed below where they hid , Harland saw that she held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her breast as a mother holds a child ; and her right arm swung in the motion of a sower , regularly as a pendulum ; and he understood what it was she thus broadcast upon the rocky sward , and he thought of a priestess at her rites , and he thought of old pagan festivals , and he thought there was a pounding and barbaric rhythm in the thudding of her horse 's hooves , and he thought of the ride of the Valkyries . For there was a singing in the way she rode , erect and sure , her head high and proud ; and he heard that singing in his blood while he watched her bring her father 's ashes to the spot the dead man she loved had chosen , to this high meadow pressed against the sky. 46 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 47father is up there with her right now , ' she exclaimed . I do n't know where she gets her notions . Certainly not from me ! ' I like to be out at night myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good company in the stars . Did she have a blanket , anything to keep warm ? ' Ruth said quietly : She packed a heavy sweater in her slicker roll . She 'll be all right , I 'm sure . ' Mrs. Berent snorted . She 's a fool  --  and so am I , to go gallivantingover mountains on a horse at my age . Ruth , I 've one of my coryzas coming on ! ' Harland reflected that she treated Ruth more like a paid companion than a daughter . I 'll fix you up , Mother , ' the girl promised , a twinkle in her eyes . When dinner was done , Mrs. Berent had begun to sneeze ; and she and Ruth said good night at once . Harland , his emotions deeply stirred by that scene he and the children had witnessed , was alert for Ellen 's return , wishing he might be with her in this hour of her lonely grief , and he waited a while on the veranda , listening for the hoofbeats of her horse . Mrs. Robie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children had chanced upon the scene on the heights that afternoon . It was a moving thing to watch , ' he said . Tess told me , ' she assented . And Glen saw you , but the others did n't know you were there . ' His own hunger to see her made him resent Ellen 's long delay , , and he said : Ellen ought to come back . She must know it worry you . You 've enough of a job , keeping us comfortable here , without riding herd on us too . ' Oh , I enjoy this , ' she assured him . I mean , making things nice here for Glen and our friends . But Ellen really is difficult , sometimes . It 's not so much selfishness as a sort of  --  is egoism the word ? When she wants to do a thing , she does n't take into account the wants of others at all . It is n't that she overrides them . She simply goes her own way  --  and they can only submit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halfamusedappraisal . I 've never seen anyone so wholly sure of herself , ' she confessed .. The three watchers stayed hidden , and they saw her turn at last , still at full gallop , and plunge into the forest at the border of the basin , diagonally across from them . So she disappeared ; and Harland heard a choked sound beside him and turned and saw that Tess had tears in her eyes ; but she smiled at him . ' That was sort of wonderful , was n't it , ' she said frankly . Professor Berent was a fine old man . ' Harland nodded , and Lin said in a low voice : That 's the trail to camp , the way she went . ' Even the boy had felt the solemn beauty of this scene . He turned his horse back among the trees , Come on , ' he called softly . We 'll go home another way so they wo n't know we were here . ' They went headlong , plunging down rocky draws , racing at full gallop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the neck pressure of the reins or even to the inclination of the rider 's body , wove through the trees in a graceful measure like a dance . They reached camp before the others . Walking to the lodge from the corral where they left their horses , Tess said warningly : We must n't let them know we were watching , Lin . ' What do you think ? ' he demanded , scornfully indignant at the suggestion . She touched his arm in affectionate reassurance . I know you wo n't , ' she assented . But I 'm glad we saw them , all the same . ' Lin nodded soberly , and she said to Harland : It was  --  sweet , was n't it , Mr. Harland . ' I 'm glad we were there , yes , ' he agreed . While Harland was in his shower , Robie and Mrs. Berent and Ruth returned , and Harland heard Mrs. Berent bitter in complaintat the torment the ride had imposed upon her ; but he did not hear Ellen 's voice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come home . Mrs. Robie was concerned . Are you sure she 's all right , Glen ? ' she asked doubtfully . Do n't worry , ' he told her . She probably wanted to be alone a while . I 've known her to ride all night , on a moonlit night ; and she knows these trails as well as I do . ' Mrs. Berent tossed her head . She probably imagines her48 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 49Harland nodded , feeling himself aggrieved . I know . When we went after turkeys , she told me exactly what to do . It never occurred to me to argue with her . ' Of course not . ' She added after a moment : Her father could n't call his soul his own . I used to feel like  --  slapping her , sometimes . I loved that old man . I 'm glad he wanted to come back here . ' Someone stirred in the shadows , coming quietly toward them , and Harland till she spoke hoped this might be Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes , ' she said . Do n't feel you must wait for Ellen , Mrs. Robie . She 's all right . ' ' We were n't sleepy , ' the older woman assured her , and Harlandasked : Where do you think she is ? ' I think she 'll stay up there till dawn , ' Ruth told them . Her voice was warm and heartening in the night . She probably hid to let us pass , and then went back there after we were surely g2re . ' She added in faint amusement : Ellen dramatizes things , you know . ' Lightning flickered far away , sending a faint wave of radiance across the cloudless sky ; but it was so distant they heard no thunder rumble . There 's rain north of us , ' Mrs. Robie doubtfully remarked . As she spoke , Robie joined them . Ellen knows her way home , if she wants to come , ' he reminded her . Ruth added : Yes . Do n't worry , please . ' She bade them good night and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was surprised to find that in the darkness she wore a beauty of which in the light of day he had never been conscious . After a moment Mrs. Robie likewise said good night , and the lightning flashed again , and Harland said : That must be an old roncher of a thunderstorm . ' We get some terrors , ' Robie agreed . Real cloudbursts . I 've seen the brook rise three feet in an hour , even here where it has room to spread all over the canyon . ' He turned away . Good night , old man . ' Harland at last abandoned his vigil , telling himself he was a fool to be concerned ; but he wondered whether he would hear Ellen 's horse if she returned during the night . He woke before sunrise and at once thought of her and dressed and went out . No one was stirring in the bunkhouse ; but one of the men must already have gone to find and bring in the horses for the day 's use , and Harland walked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the posts , was its sole occupant  --  and stayed there till he heard the clatter of hooves up the canyon . The horses came at a gallop , with tossing heads and flanks wet from the night 's fall of dew . Penned in the corral they circled excitedly , the cow shrinking and making herself small as they milled past her ; and then Charlie Yates , who had brought them in , stopped to roll a cigarette and to exchange a word with Harland . She has n't come home yet , ' he said looking up the canyon trail ; and after a moment he added : She 's a hot one , always doingthe damnedest things . You 'd think she 'd know Mrs. Robie f would be upset . ' Harland surprisingly resented this echo of his own criticism . Can I have a horse ? ' he asked stiffly . I think I 'll ride to meet her . ' Sure thing , ' Charlie agreed . I 'll go along if you say so . ' No need , ' Harland told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Charlie drawled . She knows all the answers . ' Harland realized that even Charlie must be uneasy , to speak thus of a guest . When his horse was ready , Harland set out , at first at a foot pace to conceal his own eagerness ; but once out of the other 's sight , he lifted his horse to a trot and then to a lope . The sun struck the ridges high above him ; but here in the canyon the air lay damp and cool , and he rode in shadows while in the sky the level rays swept away some shredded skeins of golden cloud . When in due time he passed the bars and left the main trail and began to climb , he ascended into sunlight that came pouring over the heights behind him in a shining flood ; and on the crest of the ridge he met Ellen face to face . So Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 51The sun was in her eyes and the sun was all upon her , so that she seemed for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stains of tears upon her cheeks , and the ravages of solitary grief in her countenance . Phrases formed themselves in his writer 's mind and he thought of a white-hot ingot coming from the tire , of molten gold in a bone-white crucible . Sorrow , the night long , had brayed her in a mortar , and her soul was swept and burnished . All right ? ' he asked , hoarse and husky . She nodded , smiling radiantly . Come , ' she said , and touched his hand , inviting him to share with her some pleasant prospect . ready now to return to the world again . ' They rode back to the lodge , and till they left their horses  --  Charlie was there to take the reins  --  she did not speak , nor did he ; but then she said gravely : Thank you , Mr. Harland . ' So they parted and Harland was alive with a mysterious excitement . He heard her mother 's querulous greeting , heard the sound of a sneeze , as Ellen went into the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen to reappear , and he stayed at the lodge all day , refusing Robie 's suggestion that the try the brooks ; but she remained invisible till dinner time . Even then he had no chance to claim her , for when they rose from the table , she joined Tess and Lin at one end of the wide veranda , and they chattered together like children , flying into gales of laughter at their own words or at nothing . Harland , sitting with Glen and Mrs. Robie twenty feet away , wished he might join them , but would not without an invitation . The moon was waxing , and the canyon was paved with magic shadows that were broken by silver light patterns , and presently the two young people and Ellen strolled away down the trail together , and their voices came back softly through the night , blurred by the steady chuckle of the brook . After a time , at some distance , he heard them singing the nonsense songs of which children  --  young or old  --  never tire , He was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers ; but Harland , feeling that Robie had read his mind , reddened in the darkness ; and he said he was sleepy and would go to bed , and did so . At breakfast Robie proposed a day of fishing , and Harland agreed and hoped Ellen might go with them ; but when Robie invitedher to do so , she declined . Lin says he and Charlie Yates and one of the cowboys want to try to locate a trail out of the box canyon up in the horse parks , ' she explained . ' I 'm going with them . ' So to Harland the fishing was dull and profitless . Back at the/ ( lodge they found she had not returned , and they sat on the verandafor a while , and the sun sank lower in the west , till at last Glen said : Look yonder ! ' Ellen and Lin had appeared on the crest of the ridge above camp , and now they brought their horses plunging down the steep descent , refusing the trail , starting a small avalanche of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding on their rumps , plunging through the pines and aspens which clad the slope , the riders with shrill cries urging them on . When they reached the level , Lin was one jump ahead ; but as they raced toward the lodge , splashing through the brook , his hand lay too heavy on the reins , so that he twitched his horse off stride . Ellen passed him and came first to the goal triumphantly . Lin had lost his hat , and from a deep scratch on Ellen 's cheek fresh blood trickled , bright crimson against her warm dark skin . They were panting and laughing , and Lin explained to his father , while he gasped for breath : ' We raced the last mile , Dad ; took a straight line , up and down , over everything . I 'd have heat her , too , but I swung too far south on the first pitch . I thought she was headed wrong . ' Glen laughed . Ellen always knows exactly where she is , and where she 's going , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Lin declared , and Ellen laughed and told him she could beat him whenever he chose . She was in52Leave Her to Heavendungarees , hot and soiled from her long day in the saddle , that scratch on her cheek a red flame , her face as smudged and sweatstainedas the boy 's ; but she appeared for dinner in something light and soft and completely feminine , and the contrast beween her ckclicate and pulsing beauty now and the disordered hoyden she had been an hour before seemed to Harland so intoxicating that he became suddenly wary . When Robie next morning proposedan inspection trip to the upper pastures , he accepted , determined to put her out of his mind . Ile and Robie rode all day , scouring every covert , starting the scattered bunches of cattle and inspecting them . Robie and Charlie decided it was time to brand and earmark the young stock , and settled on Tuesday for this task . When they returned to the lodge they found Ellen and Lin together on the veranda , and Robie asked : What have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ellen smilingly assured him . We did n't feel like doing anything strenuous , so we 've just been sitting here talking all day . ' Harland wondered whether he could spend a long clay alone with any fourteen-year-old boy - - unless of course it were Danny . Clearly Ellen liked boys , and understood them too . The youngster'seyes were shining as he watched her now . That evening the moon was brighter , and the sky a cloudless bowl of paling stars . Lin went early to bed , and Ellen after a little rose and stood by the veranda rail . I 've sat still too long , ' she said . Mr. Harland , will you walk with me ? ' Mrs. Berent  --  this was her first appearance at dinner for days  --  made a derisive sound . Quoth the spider to the fly " she said sharply ; and everyone laughed in dutiful fashion , and Harland as he joined Ellen felt hot and angry ; but when he was alone with her his anger passed . They followed the brook trail half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon was bright enough to show them every pebble in the way  --  and they went at first in silence , till Harland said at last , remembering Danny : You and Lin get along . ' I enjoy being with him , ' she agreed . Leave Her to Heaven 53I like him , too , but I ca n't imagine sitting and talking to him all day . ' Her tone was lightly quizzical . You 're ever so dignified , are n't you ? I think you 're one of those men who wear a sort of mental beard . You try to seem more reserved and mature than you really are . Except the day you shot the turkey , I 've never seen you really let go and throw back your head and laugh ! ' ' I ' see ourselves as ithers see us , ' he quoted , amused . I suppose I do n't laugh much . Laughter is the luxury of the indolent , is n't it ? Busy people do n't have time to laugh . ' You 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author never has a vacation . He 's a walking sponge , soppingup impressions till he 's saturated , then going to his desk and squeezing them out on paper . ' I 'd forgotten you 're an author , ' she confessed . Probably that 's why you like to make phrases . Of course I know you must have worked hard , to be so successful so young . ' She laughed at him in a teasing way . I suppose you think you must live up to your position , pretend a  --  gravity you do not always feel . And then of course you 're terribly shy ! ' Harland chuckled . I wonder why men always feel a little flattered at being told they 're shy . ' They like to feel they 're  --  heroes , ' she suggested smilingly . Keeping a stiff upper lip against heavy odds . ' They came to the bridge and stopped , leaning on the handrail , looking down into the clear water ; and she cried : Look ! You can see the trout , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool and fragrant . And you can smell flowers , ' he agreed . All your senses seem so much keener here . ' I know , ' she murmured . Her shoulder almost touched his , and he caught a dizzying hint of some faint scent she wore . She looked up at him and an overhanging bough between her and the moon laid a dark shadow across her nose and mouth and chin ; and he thought again , as on that first day he saw her , of those mysterious beauties of the harem , who wear a veil which hides5 4 Leave Her to Heavenall but their eyes as the shadow hid all but her eyes now ; and he smiled and spoke of this , said the shadow on her face was like one of those veils . Yashmaks ? Is that what they call them ? ' he suggested . Or it 's like one of t he handkerchiefs train robbers used to wear as masks , when this country out here was young . ' I suppose we all wear masks , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side ; and as they walked slowly back toward the lodge she asked questions about Danny ; asked where he was , and how long he had been ill , and how he progressed ; and Harland answered her , and to speak of Danny woke tenderness in him , and it was in his tones , so that she said at last : You love him almost too much , do n't you ? ' Her words faintly disturbed him , seemed to be in some way he could not define a threat to Danny . She said : I wish I knew him . I get along well with boys his age  --  and Lin 's . ' That sense of danger to Danny , groundless though it was , made his tone dry . I 'm sure you do , ' he assented . She looked at him in surprise and let her hand rest lightly on his arm , as though in reassurance ; but he did not speak again and they came back to the lodge.  --  VIII  - -  On the day set for the branding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings . Cowboys rode into the mass of milling cattle , dropped their ropes over the necks of the calves they selected , and dragged the bucking victims toward where little fires were burning and the irons were hot . Sometimes a cow followed her offspring , excited by its bawling , making alarmed or threatening movements till she was driven away . Lin helped to throw the calves , but he was not big enough to handle them easily , and his ambition sometimes outran his powers . When he tackled a lusty antagonist there might follow a protracted struggle , the calf bucking and bawling , Lin 's feet as often in the air as on the ground , till he was spattered with blood and smearedLeave Her to Heaven 55with dirt and grime  --  and completely happy . Harland , laughing with the others at the boy 's activities , had an itching impulse to dismount and try his hand ; but he could picture too clearly the ridiculous figure he would cut if he proved inept . He thought no one guessed his wish , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cool and shadowed canyons again , Ellen brought her horse beside his and said with a twinklingamusement in her tones : You were just aching to try to throw a calf , were n't you ? I could see it in your eyes . ' He grinned . Yes , I wanted to ; but I had sense enough not to try . ' I did it , last year , ' she assured him . It 's a knack , that 's all . Not hard . If there had n't been an audience , you 'd have chanced it . Another week here and I 'd feel young enough to tackle the job , even with an audience . ' Another week , yes , ' she echoed in a lower tone . But we 've only another day . ' He looked at her in sharpened attention , but then the trail narrowed so that she moved ahead , and they went single file and spoke no more . Yet at dinner that evening  --  Harland found himself between Ellen and Tess  --  she referred again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been here almost two weeks , ' she said . And yet it seems too as though we 'd always been here ! ' It 's been very pleasant , ' he agreed . She nodded and , her eyes downcast , she said softly : I 'll never forget these days . ' As she spoke she moved her hand in such a way that the movementcaught his eye , and he looked at her hand on the table here beside him and felt a shock of surprise . For the ring  --  Quinton 's ring , whom she would never marry  --  was not now on her finger ! He stared at her hand so long that she looked at him inquiringly . What is it ? ' she asked 5 6 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 57Ellen would marry him if he chose  --  but he did not so choose ! If in the future he ever regretted this decision  --  he chuckled with resolute amusement at the thought  --  he could always write a book about her . He began to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions of which such a woman might be capa- ble , and the deeds to which she might provoke a man ; and just as Ellen had once fallen asleep while reading a book he had written , so he now fell asleep while he shaped in his mind a novel in which she should play the leading role . Thus he had his revenge. - IXHarland'sdecision , it seemed to him next day , had set him free . They all sat together at breakfast and for a while on the veranda afterward , with no plans for this last day here . Without avoiding Ellen , he nevertheless was able to ignore her , and not once that day were they alone together . He remembered his plan to go out to the ranch tomorrow by way of the canyon below the lodge , fishing on the way ; and after dinner that evening he spoke to Robie about it . Robie readily promised to send a horse to meet him at the foot of the canyon . You 'll want to pack a lunch , ' he advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two or three miles you 've already fished ; but it 's slow going from there on . You 'll be all day at it . ' Harland , with a malicious satisfaction in thus escaping Ellen , decided to tell no one his plan , to leave early the next morning before the others were about . Robie agreed to this . Start as early as you like , ' he assented . Cook will put you up a lunch . I 'll have Charlie go down to the head of the gorge with you , to bring back your horse . ' So in the morning before the others appeared , Harland was on his way . Robie had said he would sometimes need to wade ; but boots were heavy walking , so he had chosen sneakers with stout soles . He carried no fish basket , but wore a sleeveless fishing vest with many pockets . His lunch was stowed in one of them , and in another a roll of cheesecloth in which he would pack any particu- larly handsome trout which he decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head , her eyes holding his . No . I took it off , forever , an hour ago . ' The moment was simple , yet there was an electric message in it . Meeting her glance , he read that message plain ; and his eyes were the first to fall . He looked at the fork beside his plate and absently turned it over and turned it back again . She began to talk to Lin , across the table , and he tried to put his thoughts in order . He felt himself entangled , held in light yet tenacious bonds ; and a stubborn anger that was half alarm took hold of him . When they rose from the table he excused himself . There was a letter he must write , he said ; and he sought the sanctuaryof his own quarters , admitting not even to himself that this was flight . He tried to write to Danny , tried to read ; but he could not , so he went to bed , yet not at once to sleep , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear beyond any doubting . Since his books began to succeed he had been more than once the target of flattering feminine glances , but never before had his own interestbeen in the slightest degree aroused . Ellen , he knew now , would marry him if he chose ; but he had been sure for years that he would never marry anyone , and he was sure tonight that he would never marry Ellen . We 'd always be either on the peaks , sublimely happy , or in the bleak valleys of anger and despair , ' he told himself ; and he knew he would prefer to dwell in a pleasant intervale , one of those lovely spots which so often he had seen along a northern river , where the grassy meadows were dotted with tall graceful elms , and quiet deer came feeding , and a little brook sang near-by , and there were friendly hills all about , and perhaps a few mountains , not too closely seen , visible far away . Yes , it was peace a man wanted . He reflected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woman an author ought to marry : self-effacing , strong , serene , with a sense of humorwhich occasionally revealed itself in her pleasant eyes . But of course there was no question of his marrying Ruth ! For that matter , there was no question of his marrying anyone ! Leave Her to HeavenWhen Charlie said good-bye to him and he was alone , Harland felt a deep relief . The beauty of the mountains and the deep canyons , the long days in the open , the nights when the stars stooped low and the moon turned the shadowed world into a silvered glory , all had combined till now to create a stage setting hard to resist . Another week here and he might have lost his wits ; but now , though he would see Ellen again tonight and tomorrow at the ranch , the spell she might have cast over hint was broken . In frank gratefulness he knew he was secure . Ile began to fish . Whenever he cast a fly , the greedy trout rushed to seize it ; but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour the sport began to pall . Then in a pearl-gray swirl where bubbles from a little cascade made the water opaque , he saw a great trout rise to suck in some tiny in- sect floating in the boil . That was a fish worth keeping , and he decided to try for it . Dropping his fly where the big one had risen , he caught at once a little native , and another and another . Not till he had taken  --  and thrown back  --  seven of these small fry did he hook a respectable fish . This one may have been a foot long , and he caught and released four more of a pound or a little over . When the fish he had seen did rise at last , Harland saw its broad side and its wide tail as it turned . He lifted the tip and the trout was on . He held it , giving it no play . It drowned quickly , and Harland , standing at the water 's edge , stooped down , and after two false tries hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the rod in one hand , the fish in the other , he turned and climbed out on the ledge above where he had been standing ; and he cracked the trout 's neck and disgorged the hook and drew out his strip of cheesecloth to pack the great fish tenderly away . It would run , he judged , a fair three pounds ; and he was admiring its fast fading colors , his ears filled with the roar of the water here beside him to the exclusion of all other sounds , when a shadow fell across the ledge on which he stood , and he looked up and saw Ellen , ten feet above him , between him and the sun . After his first instant of surprise , he knew the shock of terror which a wild thing in a trap might feel. , 58ELLEN 'S possessive devotion to her father began when she was still a baby . They spent their summers at Bar Harbor , and as soon as she could walk , he took her down to the beach to watch him dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled aside great scarves of seaweed to show her the little crabs scuttling for cover , and when neap tides exposed a whole new world to view he helped her hunt for starfish and sea urchins . This was before she was four years old , but already she thought him all her own ; and one of her baby tricks pleased him and amused everyone else except her mother . If Mrs. Berent spoke of him as Daddy , ' Ellen would cry indignantly : He 's not your Daddy . He 's mine ! ' This delighted him , and he was apt to snatch her in his arms and hug her hard . When Ellen was four , Ruth came to live with them . She was Professor- Berent 's niece , his brother 's daughter ; and after her mother died , Professor and Mrs. Berent gave her a home and on her father 's death two years later they legally adopted the little girl . Ellen , till Ruth 's coming , had ruled the household , and from the first she resented her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow them down to the beach , Ellen fiercely rebelled , crying : I do n't want her ! You 're my Daddy ! You 're not hers ! I do n't want her ! ' He at first laughed in affectionate amusement at her jealous protests ; but Ellen , if he insisted on bringing Ruth along , took every means to make her miserable , toppling her into puddles , tweaking her pigtails , bringing her sometimes to the point of tears . Eventually596o Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 6 iEllen 's persistence outwore them all , so that Ruth stayed at home with Mrs. Berent while Ellen and her father resumed their long summer ( lays together . By that time she was old enough to go out with him in the dory to pull the half-dozen lobster pots which he kept set off their landing ; and he taught her to swim in the icy water , and to sail the lit t le dinghy . He was already dabbling with the collectingwhich would become his hobby . He began with shore birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fruitful hunting grounds . Sometimes he and Ellen went off in the dory or in the sailing dinghy for two or three days at a time , taking a tent and bedding and supplies ; and Ellen tended camp while he tramped the shores or sought the island ponds to find his specimens . As she grew older he took her with him to Newfoundland or to the Provinces to fish for salmon , or into the woods to try for a deer in the fall . Their hours together were for her one long content . These delights were interrupted when he began to spend most of each summer in Texas with Glen Robie ; but when she was twenty and Roble invited Professor Berent to come to the ranch , she went west with him . The raw beauty and the bold colors of deserts blazing in the sun , snow-tipped mountains bright against the cloudless sky , parks and canyons carpeted with countless wild flowers and slopes clad in luxuriant forest green , intoxicated them both . They stayed , that first summer , two months at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second year , as though he knew he might never come again , Professor Berent twice or thrice postponed their departure , revisiting over and over beloved scenes . The day before they were at last to depart , they rode far together , and in late afternoon they came to a spot which had always held for each of them a particular charm . This was an upland pasture shaped like a saucer and surrounded by a low wooded rim which shut off any view of loftier peaks either near or far away . Their horses moved at a foot pace out across the basin , and the sky was fair and blue . It 's like riding across the front lawn of Heaven , ' Ellen said in a hushed voice . It 's beautiful , certainly , ' he agreed . When I die , ' she declared , You must bring my ashes and scatter them here . Will you , Father ? ' Why should you think of dying ? You 'll outlive me , you know , ' He smiled , but there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and symptoms , he had of late often contemplatedhis own death . Then we 'll exchange promises , ' she urged with a sweet gravity . If you die first , I 'll bring your ashes here ; and if I die first , you 'll bring mine . ' For a moment he did not speak , and when he did , it was halflaughingly . After I 'm dead , Mother can decide what becomes of what 's left of me ! ' he said , and lifted his reins . Come along . We 'll have to move if we want to make the lodge before dark . ' Ellen 's engagement to Russ Quinton resulted , in oblique ways , from this moment in the high pasture with her father . That fall , as they had sometimes done before , they went into the Maine woods to try for deer , lodging in Quinton 's cabin on a remote and lovely pond ; and for the last few days of their stay , Quinton himselfcame unannounced to join them there . He was at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University of Maine and of Harvard Law School , with political ambitions which , since any opposition was apt to provoke him to a venomous and uncontrolled anger that made him many enemies , were as yet unrealized . He and Professor Berent had met seven or eight years before , casually , as fishermen do , on the Mersey River in Nova Scotia . A mutual interest in trying to bring back eastern Maine rivers as salmon streams gave them a point of contact out of which grew a casual friendship , which Quinton , from the day he first saw Ellen , assiduously cultivated . He showered upon Professor Berent many favors  --  the gift of an occasional salmon or a basket of trout , a haunch of venison , a brace of ducks , the use of his hunting cabin  --  which it was impossible graciously to refuse , and which Professor Berent repaid by making Quinton welcome in his home . Ellen was at the time in her early teens . Quinton taught her to5a 2 , Leave Her to Heavencall him Uncle Russ ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they parted . She accepted him at first as her father 's friend , but as she approached maturity she realized that to be with her produced in him a flattering excitement , and with the precocity which resulted from her constant companionship with her father , she suspected that he was in love with her . When this fall he came to join them at his cabin she soon decided that he was trying to muster courage to ask her to marry him , and in a lively curiosityshe helped the moment to arrive . The event was disappointing . He said it would surprise herand perhaps frighten her to bear what he wished to say , but she was neither surprised nor frightened ; and she bade him go on . He did so , haltingly ; and when he was done , willing to prolong the game , she told him she would never marry anyone as long as herfather was alive . ' He needs me , and he comes first , ' she said . Quinton resentfully protested that her father would not want her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's not what he wants . It 's what I want . ' Ile persisted , and at last , roused by her coquetry , he caught her in his arms and kissed her . She enjoyed the sense of power it gave her to feel his shaken passion , and when after a moment he released her , stammering apologies , she saidsweetly : ' I 'm not angry , Russ . I know men like to do things like that togirls ; but I love my father too much to marry any other man aslong as he needs me ! ' In a sudden anger  --  she knew his high temper , had seen himstorm at the guides  --  he demanded : ' Do you mean you want me to just ate ad around waiting y dies ? ' Then , at her reproachfulsilence : ' I 'm sorry , Ellen . I 'm sorry I said that . ' ' I know you are , ' she assented , and smiled forgiveness . ' When you get mad , you blurt out things like a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her hoarselyDeliberately , she said : ' Maybe that 's why I like you . I do lateyou , you know , as well as any man I know . ' But then she saw the quick leap of delight in him , andLeave Her to Heavenlittle dismayed by the emotion she had roused , she turned quickly indoors to join her father . Quinton had to follow her . This was the last evening of their stay , and they sat long around the stove in the cabin and Quinton asked questions about New Mexico , and Ellen and Professor Berent answered him , each supplementingthe other . It was Ellen who spoke of that high mountainmeadow so near the sky , describing the beauty of the spot . ' Father and I both loved it , ' she told Quinton . ' We agreed that we want our ashes to be scattered there when we die . ' She was so accustomed to assuming that her own wishes were decisive that she did not remember Professor Berent had failed to join her in this compact ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  perhaps it was distasteful to him  --  he said casually : It 's up in a region they call the horse parks , Russ , because some wild horses range there . ' And he told Quinton how the old Spaniards brought the first horses to the Southwest , three or four hundred years ago , and thus stocked the whole vast region . So he turned the talk into other channels ; but Ellen , months hater , at a time of need , would remember that conversation and use it for her own ends . The following spring , her father died quietly in his sleep . Ellen had so long thought of him as her possession that not even his death shook her feeling of ownership . When Mrs. Berent , after the first gush of grief , began to plan that he should be buried in conventional fashion at Mount Auburn , Ellen with a jealous instinctto make every decision that concerned him , cried : ' Oh , no , Mother ! ' Mrs. Berent exclaimed in surprise : For Heaven 's sake , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhesitatingly found an answer . ' Because that was n't what he wanted ! He wanted to be cremated , wanted me to take his ashes to New Mexico ! ' ' New Mexico ? ' Mrs. Berent was astonished . ' Why , that 's the most outlandish thing I ever heard of ! He never mentioned it to me ! ' There were lots of things he did n't tell you , ' Ellen said cruelly , 64 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 65This was so true that Mrs. Berent made no effort to deny it Now you want him stuffed away underground in Mount Auburn , because that 's what all your friends do with their husbands when they die ; but Father was n't like them ! He 'd hate being shut up to stifle in a grave . ' Her mother urged , near tears : Why , Ellen , I simply ca n't believe it . He 'd surely have told me . o . ' You mean you think I 'm lying ? ' Mrs. Berent sniffed in sudden anger . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day you would n't lie to have your own way . ' Ellen persisted ; but Mrs. Berent was for once as stubborn as she , and Ellen tried to enlist Ruth 's support . It was often possible to win the other girl by tender cajolery , but in this matter Ruth was firm . I think Mother 's the one to decide , Ellen , ' she suggested . But Ruth darling , I tell you Father said ... ' Ruth smiled affectionately . Arc you sure ? You know , Ellen . you 're always apt to believe things happened the way you wanted them to happen . ' Their incredulity , coupled with her own secret memory that they were right , infuriated Ellen . It was bad enough to be called a liar ; it was worse when the accusation was true . But , suddenly recalling that night in Quinton 's cabin , she was sure she could make him support her , and she telegraphed him : Father died yesterday . Please come to me . ' She knew what hopes that messagewould arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train  --  this was the morning of the second day after Professor Berent died  --  and told her plight and demanded his corroboration . Mother thinks I 'm lying ! ' she said . But you heard Father say that he wanted his ashes taken out there . She 'll have to believe you ! ' Why , I remember you said something about it , but ... ' No , no , it was he who said it , ' she insisted . Surely you have n't forgotten ! It was the night you asked me to marry you . ' She caught his hand . You ca n't have forgotten that night ! ' She was so distressed and beseeching that he could not deny her ; sohe told her he did remember , and  --  this was in the taxicab , on their way to her home  --  she clung to him , weeping with relief and triumph ; and he cried , holding her close : Ellen , darling , darling , your father does n't need you now . But I do , I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heedless and unthinkingly . The future was unimportant , if she could bind him to her present cause . But first I must do this last thing for him . ' When he confirmed her testimony as to Professor Berent 's wishes , Mrs. Berent surrendered ; but before Quinton went back to Maine , he had Ellen 's promise that she would marry him in the fall . His grateful kisses neither pleased nor offended her . He was her ally against her mother , and for the moment this was her only concern . She expected to go to New Mexico alone to do her errand there but this proposal Mrs. Berent flatly rejected , and with the invincibleinflexibility to which weak people may by long persecution be provoked , she insisted that she too  --  and of course Ruth  --  would see her husband 's ashes to their last resting place . Robie , in response to Ellen 's letter , said business this year would keep him from the ranch till late June . He fixed a date for their coinmg , and hospitably suggested a fortnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summer at Bar Harbor , and Mrs. Berent fretted at this disturbance of her routine ; but when Ellen repeated that she could quite as well go alone , her mother re-torted : Nonsense ! I 'm ready to do my duty ! Of course , I 've never been west of Philadelphia ! ' Her tone confessed the confirmed Bostonian 's misgiving at venturing into the hinterland . But I 'm prepared for some discomfort , and I 'm sure Mr. Robie will make things as easy for us as he can . '  --  xlDuring the weeks of waiting , while spring came to Boston and tulips bloomed in the Public Garden , Ellen refused to re-enter66 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 67with Ruth and her mother their familiar ways , telling herself that by resuming their weekly attendance at Symphony , by going sometimes to the theatre or to the moving pictures , they proved themselves heartless and callous . She spent her time sorting her father 's papers and possessions . He had converted to his own use the topmost floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , building moth-proof cabinets around the walls to hold his sets . She cleaned the scalpels and dissecting scissors and needles , put the spools of thread in their rack and the rolls of cottonon the shelf , set the jars of arsenic and of plaster of Paris and the tray of assorted glass eyes in order , labelled and put away some unmounted skins . She devoted long hours to this selfimposedtask , and one day the glass jars of arsenic caught her attention . She took up one of them and poured a little of the white powder into her hand . For years the poison had been to her just one of the materials which she and her father used in their work toge  --  er , but she remembered now that it was deadly stuff If she swallowed even a little of it she would ( lie ; and she imagined Ruth and her mother finding her here lifeless , and she heard them say sorrowfully : She loved her father so ! ' Her eyes misted with wistful tears and she pitied herself profoundly  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jar and covered it again . A week before their prospective departure , Quinton came to Boston to see her . lIe arrived on Saturday , and suggested that they spend Sunday together . I 'll hire a car and we 'll drive down to the shore , ' he said , and Ellen indifferently agreed . At the appointed hour he called for her , slick and shining , perspiringwith delight , and she felt a brief distaste ; but she took her place at his side . Ile drove to the tip end of Cape Ann . When they left the car to walk down to the rocks he produced from the rumble a magnificent picnic basket fitted with thermos bottles , paper plates and cups , plated knives and forks and spoons , and canisters for salt and pepper and sugar , with a compartment for ice , and neat aluminum containers for sandwiches . He showed her all these wonders with a pride which hid his misgivings . Oh Russ , you should n't ! ' she said reproachfully . It 's so extravagant ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a whole dining room in itself , ' she declared ; but later , while they lunched on the rocks above the shore , she saw his almost miserly pride in this treasure . Maliciously curious to see what he would do , sweetening her coffee , she allowed the small sugar canister to escape from her fingers and roll off the ledge . It fell into a deep crevice among the rocks , and Quinton labored for an hour in a vain effort to recover it , moving heavy boulders , wettinghis feet and staining his trousers with sea slime , while Ellen with her arm across her eyes lay baking in the sun . In spite of the fact that the kisses she had had to accept upon their arrival had rather irritated than pleased her , she resented his neglecting her while he sought so long to get back that absurd canister ; and when she said they must go and he urged that they had had as yet hardly any time together , she said chidingly that he should have thought of that before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without trying to reach it , ' he protested , so disturbed by this wasteful loss that she smiled and forgave him . So they stayed a little longer and she gave him enough of herself to make his head swim with dreams and sent him back to Maine a happy man . In due time thereafter , with her mother and Ruth , she started for New Mexico . Leaving Chicago , Mrs. Berent and Ruth shared a drawing room , and Ellen had the adjoining compartment . She retired early . Among the parting gifts from friends in Boston there had been a book called Time Without Wings , about which everyone  --  said Janet Mowbray , who had given it to them  --  was talking . On the first night out of Chicago , Ellen began to read this book , and in the morning when she went back to the observation car , it was under her arm . But Ellen was never much addicted to reading , and she presentlyfell asleep in her chair . As her grasp upon the book relaxed , it slid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream in which she had been happy with her father ; and in that1468 Leave Her to Heavendream he was young again , with fair hair , and merry , unwearied eyes , When now she woke , her father  --  or someone , to hey sleepy eyes , incredibly like him as he had been in her dream e picked up the book and handed it back to her . Seeing his face , her throat constricted . She thanked him automatically , but after he resumed his seat across the car she watched him with a breathlessattention . Her thoughts  --  and her eyes  --  remained fixed upon him till at last his glance met hers . He stood up , coloring with anger , and she realized that she had embarrassed him . To her apology , he muttered something and walked away ; and she hastened to her mother , an eagerness in her which she made no effort to disguise . ' Mother , ' she demanded , ' Did Father have any relatives , brothers or nephews or anything ? ' ' Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he died ten years ago . For Heaven 's sake , why ? ' ' Did that other brother have any sons ? ' Mrs. Berent said sharply . ' I should hope not . He was a bachelor ! What 's got into you ? ' Ellen said in a hushed tone . ' There 's a man on the train who looks exactly the way lather used to look , enough like him to be related anyway . ' ' What of it ? That 's not surprising ! Your father was a **25;428;TOOLONG man . ' Ellen 's eyes flashed with anger , but Ruth smilingly played peacemaker . ' I always thought Father looked rather wonderful , Mother , ' she protested . ' Ellen , point this man out to us if you get a chance , wo n't you ? ' But Ellen , resenting her mother 's attitude , said coldly : ' You probably would n't see any resemblance . Neither of you saw Father with my eyes . ' She went into her own compartment and closed the door . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him again in the diner , but he did not appear for lunch nor for dinner , nor when she frankly tried to find him was he in the club or observationcars . After Ruth and her mother were abed , she walkedLeave Her to Heaven 69the length of the train , but her search was fruitless . Knowing he must be shut away behind some closed door , she wished to knock at every one , imagining him secret and alone , wishing to share his solitude . When , surrendering , she returned at last to her compartmentand to bed , she lay long awake , crushed under a weight of loneliness because he was lost to her forever . But in the morning they left the train and Glen Robie was on the platform , and after the first greeting he asked Mrs. Berent : ' Did you see Mr. Harland ? ' Harland ? ' she echoed . ' Who 's he ? ' ' Richard Harland , ' he said . ' He 's the man who wrote that new 30 hook , Time Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here he is now ! ' Ellen , half-guessing the truth , turned to look where Robie pointed ; and she saw Lin and a tall young man coming toward them and felt as though a firm hand had gripped her heart . Her senses clouded dizzily , and when presently she was seated beside Harland in the touring car , her shoulder against his , she pressed her hands to her cheeks , thinking they must feel hot to her palms ! All the surface of her body everywhere was tingling deliciously and frighteningly too . She was glad that Robie talked as he drove , so that she need not speak for a while . Her voice , she feared , might betray her , and when at last she dared turn to Harland with some careful , laughing word , she saw Ruth , sitting on his other side , look at her in wonder at her tone. - III - The fortnight that followed , at the ranch and then at Robie 's fishing lodge in the mountains , was for Ellen a time of breathless wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be borne . She , was caught in a torrent of emotions so strange and new that she was at first bewildered and overwhelmed ; a torrent so strong that she could not resist it . At first , instinctively , she sought to avoid Harland and the others too ; and she took a horse every morning , disappearing70 Leave Her to Heavensometimes for the whole day , returning only at dinnertime . But though she went alone , yet in her thoughts Harland was beside her . There was one day when she rode to a lofty outlook and securedher horse and sat for long hours on a bold rim high above a hidden canyon , basking in the sun , her eyes ranging unseeingly ; and in her fancy she welcomed him there to share her solitude , speaking aloud , carrying on with him long conversations that were tinglingly impersonal and polite , rich with unuttered meanings . She lay for a while , her arms tight across her breast , her big hat shading her face against the sun , her eyes closed ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imagined him coming ardently to seek her here . This complete and absorbed attention to everything a man did or said , this constant hope that Harland would turn to her , coupled with a breathless anticipation that was something like terror , was new in her life . Iler devotion to her father had armoredher against those hours of tremulous and unadmitted longingswhich almost any chance-met boy may provoke in a girl still in her teens , rcn ( lered intensely sensitive to ihasculine approaches by forces within herself which she has been taught she must not recognize . Once when Ellen was twelve there had been a senior at Tech who sometimes came home with her father to discuss a thesis upon which he was at work , and who for weeks seemed to her the most completely wonderful person she had ever seen , so that she dreamed of him both awake and asleep and gave him openly a youthful adoration which she was not yet old enough to conceal . But this keen awareness of Harland was at once less frank and more profound ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a quickened pulse , a warm flush on cheeks and throat , a faintness , a soft readiness for surrender  --  which even the sound of Harland 's voice could provoke in her now . Hoping his thoughts might be drawn to her as hers were drawn to him , she wondered whether he knew from Roble their errand here ; and she wished her habit of seeking the solitudes would provoke his curiosity , lead him to question her . She planned her answers , planned the very words in which she would tell him , Leave Her to Heavenwistfully , about her father ; and she pictured the sympathy and the new understanding which would appear in his eyes as he listened . She played , without admitting it even to herself , the part of one silently enduring a hopeless grief ; and she imagined him observing and conjecturing . But he made no approach to her ; and when at breakfast one morning she saw an opportunity to suggest that they go together io seek turkeys , she seized upon it , hiding her eager hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a flurry of soft panic , a telicious fear of what these hours alone with him might bring , which led her to say that they need not go till afternoon . All morning alone she blamed herself for that weakness . They might , q she had been bold , have spent the long day together . Till the aunch hour she waited in dread lest he change his mind , cancel this plan . Yet when the time came for them to start , she was  --  at least outwardly  --  perfectly composed . She led the way , sure that his eyes rested upon her as he followed close behind . She rode well , and knew it , and wished him to remark it . He did not speak , but she was as conscious of his watching her as though she saw his eyes . All her senses seemed on that ride together to be sharpened . The sky and the mountains had never been so beautiful , the odor of the sun-warmed pine spills upon the ground never so keen , the occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and true . Even to watch the sliding shoulder-muscles of her horse as he breasted a steep climb or picked his way down an abrupt descent contented and delighted her . She had an extraordinary awareness of the life currents within her , and of Harland close behind , and of the solitudes in which they rode ; and alone with him she felt a breathless terror which was half longing too . At the spot she chose they hid their horses in the wood and walked out to the middle of the park-like canyon floor ; and she fed him to a shallow grassy depression and bade him lie beside her . Then for a while they did not speak , and she lay with her chin on her hands , staring up the canyon , feeling her heart pound against72 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 73 the turf beneath her breast , not looking at him yet seeing every line of his profile and the bulk of his shoulders thrust upward by the position of his crossed arms , and feeling the length of him along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her foot might have touched his . He spoke at last , some laughing word about the ant she brushed from her throat , and she found herself talking of her father ; and though their talk was commonplace she felt in every word she spoke and in every word of his a quality of suspense of over- whelming forces held for the present in abeyance yet which might at any moment break all bounds . She turned her head at last to look at him , and met his eyes , and he said he knew her errand at the lodge ; and this knowledge on his part seemed to her to draw them close together , so that in an instinctive defensive gesture she looked away again . He spoke of his brother Danny . She had , as have many whole and healthy people , an innate repugnance for any sickness or deformity , so that she shivered slightly when hE referred to Danny 's illness . Then she remembered that she knew so little about Ilarland , only his name and his work and that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that he was married , and she found herself questioning him ; and when he said lie was not married she controlled her breathing so that he might not see her sudden relief . Then he spoke of her ring . She had for these ( lays completely forgotten Quinton . She told Harland about him and added calmly : But I will never marry him . ' Until that moment she had not known this , but as soon as she remembered Quinton she knew it certainly and beyond doubting . From that quiet word of hers , she thought as she spoke , much might have followed ; but then Harland saw turkeys coming , and at her direction , when the time came , he shot one . It was only wounded , and he had to run to dispatch it , and the unaccustomed exercise at these high altitudes exhausted him , and she wished to take him in her arms and cherish him , and forced herself to look at the turkey instead , and to speak , as though this were impor- tant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet even then , on pretext of fetching the horses , she hurried to leave him so that he might not guess the tenderness which his distress had provoked in her ; and when she returned with the animals she was controlled again . He was triumphant and gay and laughing and full of eager conversation , and she entered into his mood and they rode merrily back to camp . She thought exultantly that night that she would never lose what this day she had gained . Next morning before breakfast her mother announced  --  she had been lamed till now by the all-day ride from ranch to lodge  --  that she was ready to go to see her husband 's ashes sown across the high meadows . Ellen had almost forgotten this duty ; but she welcomedit now as one welcomes the turning of the last page of a book , when another , full of promise , waits to be opened . She agreed that this should be the day ; but when Harland and Lin and Tess planned at breakfast to ride to the horse parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tess was beautiful and that Harland might find her so . She could not change plans already made , but she was wretched all morning , her thoughts following them jealously . On the ride up to the heights that afternoon , Mrs. Berent groaned and complained ; for the way was steep and she was ill at ease in the saddle . Professor Berent 's ashes were in a sealed bronze casket which till now had been in Ellen 's charge , and which now , wrapped in sweater and slicker , rode at her cantle . When they came to their goal , she left Robie and her mother and Ruth sitting their horses together in the center of the basin , and rode out toward its rim ; and at an easy lope , she began a wide circle around them , carrying the casket in the curve of her arm , lifting the ashes a handful at a time , letting them sift through her fingers as she rode . Then the pricking ears of her horse led her to look across to the trees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Harlandcome there into view . Almost at once they drew back out of sight again ; but to know that Harland was sharing this moment with her sharpened her emotional reaction , and  --  unconsciously dramatizing her own part  --  she put her horse to a faster gait , 74 Leave Her to Heavenfeeling Harland watching her ; and she rode like a soldier on parade , eyes straight ahead , looking neither right nor left , sowing the ashes broadcast with a rhythmic sweep of her arm . When with the circle of the basin not half completed , she found the casket almost empty , she had a sense of anticlimax ; but since no one could at a distance guess the deception , she continued that motion of a sower till , completing the circuit , coming back to the head of the trail , she saw the chance for an effective exit and plunged into the forest and was gone . She rode halfway back to camp before a new thought occurred to her , and she took a side trail to avoid the others and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not return to the lodge for dinner , Harland  --  after their hour together yesterday  --  would surely come to seek her . She found the basin deserted , and on the highest point along its rim she built of scattered rocks a cairn where she bestowed the empty casket upon which her father 's name had been engraved . Staying there where she could overlook the open sweep below her , she waited for Harland to appear . At sunset he had not come , nor at ( lark ; but the waxing moon made night as light as ( lay , and still she waited , at first surely , then half-angrily , then in deep 1f-pity , telling herself none cared9 not even he , whether she returned . She decided stubbornly to wait here till he came . Sweater and slicker were scant protection against the chill , frosty night , and she built a small fire and huddlednear it . Night had no terrors for her , and she began wistfullyto enjoy the part she played , thinking of herself as a bereft daughter mourning here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , tethered to an oak sapling , became restless , she unsaddled him and secured him in such a way that he had more freedom . The saddle blanket , unfolded , served as a ground sheet on which she sat and which when she grew chilly she drew over her shoulders . The horse was cold and uneasy , stamping and blowing ; but she kept the blanket , let him endure the penetrating chill . She stayed there stubbornly till dawn , at once hungry for Harlandto come and furious because he did not . If he had from theLeave Her to Heaven 75first revealed an eagerness as great as hers , she might before this have been ready to forget him ; but since he had not , and since any denial of her wishes was always a spur to her determination , this night alone fused her vague dreams into a hot resolution . The fact that , returning , she met him on the trail seemed to promise the victory she coveted ; but to whet his appetite she devoted herself that evening to Lin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charlie Yates and one of the cowboys who had ranch business to do . Because she was an overflowing vessel full of tenderness which must find some outlet , she was that day extravagantly sweet to Lin ; and after lunch they left the others and rode home alone , and in a charming fashion she made laughinglove to the youngster till his head was whirling , giving him all the smiles , the winning glances , the affectionate words , the entrancinglaughter she was ready to offer Harland . That evening after dinner , since he still held aloof , she summonedHarland to walk down the brook with her in the moonlight ; and when she came back to the cabin which she and Ruth and her mother shared , Mrs. Berent demanded : Ellen , are you trying to start a flirtation with that young man ? ' Ellen answered quietly : No , Mother . ' Flirtation ' was not the word for the passionate certainty which filled her . Mrs. Berent tossed her head . You act mighty like it to me ! ' she declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're engaged to another man , and I 'm going to see to it that Mr. Harlandknows it ! You 'll have your trouble for your pains ! ' Ellen smiled icily . You ought at least to ask what his intentionsare before you warn him off , ' she said , and went to her room . But next day at the branding , remembering that their stay here was almost done , something like panic seized her . She had so little time ! Recalling her mother 's threat , that night before dinnershe laid aside Quinton 's ring , and when Harland noticed this and spoke of it , she looked at him , meaning him to read her eyes , meaning him to know she was his if he would have her . When his eyes fell , she knew he had understood. ' 76 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 77After dinner he excused himself and disappeared , and she was sure that when the others had retired he would come to her , and she stayed on the lodge veranda to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wished to go to him and could find no pretext to do so . The longing in her was almost unbearable , and she went to her room at last , her lips dry , her heart wrung , her breath Bowing sbal:enly . Next morning before breakfast , making her decision irrevocable , she packed Quinton 's ring and addressed it and put it in the mail pouch . She told herself Harland would surely turn to her that day , but he did not , and tomorrow they would ride out to the ranch , and the day after or the day after he would go his way and she must go hers ! That night she lay long awake , considering  --  and discarding  --  a thousand devices by which she might draw Harland to her side , sure only that in the few hours which remained she must somehow win him to be hers forever . When she came to breakfast on the last morning , Harland was not there . At her carefully casual question , Robie explained that he had made an early start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the lodge , following the brook to where a horse would meet him in the late afternoon and fetch him to the u inch . Her hands , hidden under the table , clenched hard . I shall go after him , ' she said , half to herself . Then , realizing that her tone and her words suggested open pursuit , and willing to dissemble , she added quickly : . I 've always wanted to make that trip . You can send a horse to meet me , too . ' Robie courteously assented ; but when they rose from the table Mrs. Berent drew Ellen aside and said sharply : You 're not going chasing after Mr. Harland ! You 're coming along with us ! You 're making a perfect fool of yourself over that young man ! ' Ellen said recklessly : I love him . I 'm going to marry him , Mother . ' Marry him ! Do n't be absurd ! You 're engaged to Mr. Quinton . ' Ellen looked at her ringless hand . I 'm not engaged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Berent made a startled sound . 1 mailed his ring back to him yesterday . ' You 're making a mistake , ' her mother urged . Mr. Quinton is n't the sort of man with whom you can play fast and loose ! Heaven knows I ca n't imagine what you ever saw in him , but I 'll tell you one thing . He wo n't submit easily to being jilted ! ' Ellen remembered that Quinton was by repute a dangerous enemy , but she shook her head . I 'll not be frightened into mar ying him , Mother , ' she insisted . If that 's what you 're trying to do . ' And she repeated : I 'm going to marry Mr. Harland . ' Mrs. Berent wrung her hands , defeated ; she tried pleading. , Ellen , do n't do this . Ride out to the lodge with us , please . I want you to . ' Ellen looked at her in a sort of wonder , astonished that her ' mother should persist in this attempted interference with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she said , and giving the older woman no chance for a further word she turned away . One of Robie 's men rode with her down the canyon as far a horses could comfortably go , and she went on afoot . She had dressed this morning for the ride out to the ranch , discarding dune garees for a divided skirt and a light silk shirt of many colors like a Scotch plaid , and knotting a yellow handkerchief loosely around her throat ; and since before she made her new plans the pack horses had already departed with her luggage , it had been impos sible to change . So her movements were somewhat hampered. , and her riding shoes were ill suited to this clambering over boul ders , their soles slippery , forever threatening to betray her . Yet she proceeded in a heedless haste . But when she saw Harland  --  he was intently fishing a little pool  --  she was content to watch him for a while , scanning every line of his body , delighting in the set of his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowed to slender hips . Only when at Oast he caught a great trout did she reveal herself . Her shadow lay across the rock where he stood and she moved so that her shadow moved and he looked up and saw her there. 78 Leave Her to Heaven  --  IvWhen Harland 's startled eyes met hers , they were empty of welcome , and Ellen saw this and her breath caught ; but  --  she would somehow make him glad of her company . She climbed down to stand beside him , and cried admiringly : Oh what a beauty ! ' Why did you come ? ' he asked in sharp challenge . Something thudded in her throat and her cheeks burned and at his tone her heart contracted in a knot of pain ; but she spoke lightly . I asked where you 'd gone , ' she explained , and Mr. Robie told me . I 've never fished down through here , so I thought you would n't mind if I came along . ' Her answer was matter-of-fact and reassuring ; and she spoke quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to make Harland glad she was here She succeeded , felt his resentment abate . He wrapped the trout in cheesecloth and packed it away in the big game pocket of his vest , and they went on down the canyon . Ellen was full of a singing triumph because he had accepted her companionship . It was enough , for the moment , that they should be together . For the first hours , she fished as earnestly as if it were for this she had cone . They caught many trout smaller than his big one and threw them back , enjoying the sport together . Toward one o'clock , he proposed that they eat lunch . She had neglected to bring sandwiches . He was sure he had enough for both of them , but when he opened his packet she said laughingly : Heavens , I 'd eat all that and cry for more . I 'm famished . We 'll catch some little trout and cook them . ' While he started a fire , she landed four small fish and  --  proud to display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spitted them on sharpened twigs , and salted them well and set the twigs upright beside the fire . When they were cooked through , the toasted them briefly above the coals till they were crisp and curling . She and Harland ate them like small ears of corn , holding them crosswise , plucking off the sweet pink flesh with their teeth . Leave Her to Heaven 79They sat together on a warm ledge on the sunny side of the stream ; and Ellen was merry , laughing easily , sure he was happy with her now . A strong exhilaration ran through her like the fumes of wine , and to feel him by her side gave her a keener pleasure than she had ever known . When they were done , he lighted her cigarette and his own , and seeing his strong hands cup the match so near her lips made her heart beat against her ribs . She filled her lungs with a long inhalation and expelled the smoke , her eyes meeting his as he flipped the burned match into the stream . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to end this moment 's silence  --  for which she wished only one ending . I 'm sorry for the poor little fish here , ' she said , in mock sympathy . The falls are so many and so steep that they ca n't get upstream , and down below the brook just sinks into the desert and disappears . There 's nowhere they can go . I expect it 's a relief , really , when someone like us comes along and catches them ! ' They do n't act relieved , ' he reminded her , and they laughed together for no reason except that the day was fine , and they were young and well-content . He stirred a little , as though to rise and go on ; and she felt time slipping through her fingers , dreading the end of this day they would spend together . She might devise some accident which would delay them , keep them overnight here in the canyon , and she thought , smiling inwardly at the notion : If that happened , Mother 's sufficiently Victorian so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to marry me ! ' At the same time she felt , rather than heard , a deeper rumble like thunder . The small segment of sky which they could see was clear and cloudless , and she thought rain might be near ; and if they were caught by one of the drenching mountain downpours , it might raise the brook and make this canyon impassable . So she spoke quickly , to delay him here as long as possible , ingeniously dilating upon the hard fate of the trout imprisoned in these rushingwaters , knowing only this constricted and unchanging world . They 've such narrow horizons , ' she said , and he argued , amused by her foolery : But are n't all our horizons limited ? We 're no better off than the trout ! Not so well off , perhaps ! Certainly they could n't ask a lovelier spot in which to live . ' All the same , I 'm sure a lot of them are dissatisfied , ' she gaily insisted . Probably the young gentlemen trout want to go off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure they love to wander , and their wives complain . I can just hear them . " It 's all right for you , John , traipsing away up and down brook Heaven knows where , while I have to stay at home drudging from daylighttill dark . " ' He chuckled and  --  as though he were the husband thus reproached  --  retorted : Nonsense , my dear ! I 've given you a charming home here . Deep , cool water , and rocks under which to hide , and a nice hatch of flies every day all summer . What more can any self-respecting trout-wife want ? ' Well , I want to travel , for one thing , ' she declared , delighted to have won him to this foolery , hoping he would not heed the distantthunder sounds . I never thought when I got married that it meant just settling clown with my nose rubbing the same gravel bar for the rest of my life ! ' All right , come along with me , then , ' he proposed . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact , it 's just a business trip I 'm taking today . Old Bill Cutthroat up in the falls pool has worked out a new way of trapping grasshoppers , and if it 's as good as he says it is , I want to get in on the ground floor . ' Ellen put on an affectedly querulous tone , keeping up the play . How can I travel ? With my figure , I 'm just a public laughingstock ! Having fifty thousand children every fall is no fun , I can tell you . Try it yourself some time ! ' They 're my children too , ' he reminded her , and added with an exaggerated leer : And  --  I always thought having them was fun ! ' Then , with ponderous tenderness : Seriously , my dear , you know I 'd spare you all that if I could ! ' She found it hard to control her breathing . This idle makebelievewith which they amused themselves carried overtones8 0 Leave Her to HeavenLeave Her to Heaven 8 Iwhich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed her head , continuing the play . I 'll remind you of that , next spring ; but a lot of good it will do ! You 'll start talking about our duty to the race ! I know you ! ' Their eyes held for a moment and then they broke into laughter , and she thought this shared mirth drew them closer ; and then the sunlight where they sat suddenly faded and was gone . Harlandlooked up . Hullo , ' he said , surprised . There 's a cloud ! You know that 's almost the first cloud I 've seen since we came out here ! ' She spoke in casual reassurance : Oh , there are always thundershowerssomewhere in the mountains . ' But he rose , and she saw that he too was conscious now of an ominous tingling in the air , a quickening in the breeze that drew down the canyon . We 'd better move , ' he suggested . We do n't want to get caught in a cloudburst up here . ' She knew better than Harland how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their picnic ground , prolonging in every possible fashion these pregnant hours . She gathered the paper in which his lunch had been wrapped , burning it in the embers of the little fire , wetting down the ashes till not even steam arose . Below the great pool , the stream snaked its way through a narrowrow gorge , pinnacles rising straight up a hundred feet or more on one side or the other ; and they had to pick a careful way , sometimeswading in the shallow border of the brook , sometimes steppingfrom one rock to another , sometimes clambering along the slopes above the stream . The sky was darker , and once there was a flicker of lightning , and Harland instinctively made haste ; but Ellen would not be hurried . Looking up , she saw a churning , wind-torn mass of cloud which seemed to be descending , falling straight down upon them smotheringly . She paused to watch it , but Harland pushed on till he was well ahead , not knowing she had stopped , so that she had to scramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of the gorge , she was panting . Within half an hour after the sun was first obscured , the rain8 2 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 83caught them . It came down the canyon on their heels , slowly , so that they saw the solid wall of falling water two hundred yards away ; and they could see , as the rain came nearer , individual drops as big as buck shot which struck the sunwarmed ledges and exploded , quickly turning to steam , till the rain wetted and cooled the stones . When the first downpour overtook them they found shelter under an overhang to wait for it to pass . The rain fell with ' a frightening violence , the drops pelting into the brook and turningthe opposite wall of the canyon into a sluicing cascade of muddy water . The din was deafening , and they had to shout to be heard . Harland brought his lips close to her ear to say : I never thought rain could fall so hard . ' She nodded , leaning so that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it like this often , up here . Remember there was a washouton the branch line of the railroad , the day we came . These mountain streams become rivers , rushing out across the desert plain . ' : The brook at their feet had already begun to rise ; and Ellen watched the water on a slanting stone which was sheltered as they were from the direct downpour . The flood crept up its sloping surface , visibly higher minute by minute . There was , she guessed , almost three miles of canyon which they must still traverse ; but rain fell harder , and it was darker all the time , and she thought , half-frightened now , that the rain would not relent till night came down and caught them here . Yet  --  it would be bliss to huddle with him beside a little lire , finding warmth and shelter in his arms , whispering together the long night through ; and her eyes softened at the thought . Harland looked at his watch uneasily , but she did not ask the hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said : Is n't it curious that when it rains we always think it 's never going to stop ? ' We ought to move on . ' Oh , this will be over soon . ' The brook boiled past , yellow with mud brought down from the canyon walls , rising steadily , and after a little Harland graspedher arm . Come along . It will be waist-deep here in half an hour . ' He drew her to her feet so forcibly that she was thrown against him ; and for a moment , as though he had snatched her into a swift embrace , all the strength drained out of her so that she hung heavy on his arm . All right ? ' he asked . She hid her eyes from him . Perfectly , ' she said . They had to wade to their knees to pass the end of the overhangwhich sheltered them , and the current was strong against their legs , and Harland gripped her hand to steady her . As they took the first steps , the brook seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single hungry surge , a solid wall of water like a tidal bore plunging down the canyon as though somewhere above them a dam had let go . It swirled about their knees before they reached the end of the overhang and scrambled out on firm ground . Yet even here , water pouring down the slopes ran ankle-deep , and they came into the full beat of the rain , and it was as though they had stepped under a waterfall . The big hats they both wore  --  Robie had outfitted Harland on his arrival , but Ellen 's was an old friend left over from former visits to the ranch  --  sustained the first impact ; but from shoulders down they were instantly wet through , and almost at once the hatbrims surrendered to the weight of water upon them and drooped about their ears . Ellen thought they could not travel far in this . The buffeting of the rain , hitting them a thousand blows each second , would speedily beat all their strength away . As though he had the same thought , Harland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet above them a boulder which hung at an angle , with a slanting face that promised some protection ; and  --  holding her hand , tugging her after him  --  he turned that way . They had to climb on hands and knees , through muddy water inches deep which made many little torrents , and they slid helplessly backward now and then , fighting to recover the lost ground , laughing and panting , wet and begrimed . The struggle to achieve even that short ascent was a hard one ; but at last they reached their goal and found some shelter from the bruising beat of the rain. 84 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 85Ellen 's lungs were bursting with the effort , and for a while she could only gasp for breath . When she could speak , she told him smilingly : ' This is as bad as chasing turkeys ! ' He nodded , and they sat with their backs against the boulder , pulling their feet up out of the downpour . The din about them was too great to permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only dimly see the brook below . They were wet hrough , and when the wind came it was cold . Ellen remembered that when Harland lighted their luncheon fire he had taken a match out of a waterproof box , and she was glad his matches were dry ; for unless the rain relented , they would have to spend the night here , and though she half hoped this would happen , without a fire it would be a wretched business . Robie of course would guess their situation , but not even the sure-footed western horses could pick a way through this jumble of great boulders to come to the rescue . She was content to sit in silence , waiting for the pounding of her heart to ease . If she had not overtaken him , Harland would be alone here in this downpour ; and thinking of him drenched and cold and alone , she felt toward him a brooding , almost maternal tenderness , glad that she could be here with him , could share with him whatever was to come . She watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and defend . He was staring at the flood with frowning eyes , and she told him , her lips close to his ear : We 're all right . This will pass . ' We 're so damned helpless ! ' he said rebelliously . She pressed closer , huddling against the insinuating cold , wishing to make him feel her trust and her reliance . They could make no move till the violence of the rain should abate . It came in gusts , slatting and spattering against the rocky slopes as if it were thrown out of a gigantic bucket . Its violence was frightening , and even Ellen felt this ; yet since they were together , nothing else mattered to her . If they were never to be parted , then she had no fear . Which at last the rain slackened , Harland stirred like a prisonerwho sees open the way to an escape ; and then , as suddenly as it had come , the shower moved on down the canyon . The clouds began at once to vanish , the sun fighting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the warming air . We 've got to move , ' he told her , and with no other word they started , Harland picking their path while she obediently followed . At first their chilled limbs were awkward and uncertain , but their own exertions warmed them . For a while they made good time . But to advance was difficult . The canyon walls were high , and rimrock barred their escape to the heights above . Sometimes they slipped on muddy footing , sometimes on wet rocks ; and where the way was steep , they clung like cats . Sometimes , as Harland chose what promised to be the easiest path , they were high above the water , sometimes , at its very brink . Once Ellen called to him , and he stopped to hear what she said  --  the roar of the brook was like fists pounding them  --  and she cried : We forgot the rods , left them back at the big pool ! ' He nodded shortly . I 've had enough fishing for today , ' he shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im- measurably . The brook was so much risen that they could never cross it , and they had to stay on the south side of the canyon . Once they were near disaster . This was at a spot where at the foot of an abrupt declivity a slope of rubble and mud slanted down into the stream . They worked precariously across , and Harland found more secure footing on the further side and turned to give Ellen his hand ; but when she reached out to take it , the loose stuff beneath her let go , and she slid in a small avalanche of shale and mud fairly into the water . She had a moment of sharp terror as she saw the torrent about to engulf her ; but by good luck there was a shallow bar , and although she was rolled over and over , and bruised against the stones , the water was no more than waist- deep . Harland plunged in to catch her and help her to her feet and back to solid footing again , and she clung to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her go . All right ? ' he challenged , harsh in his concern. 86 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 87She nodded , wiping the water from her streaming face , pushing back wet strands of hair that lay plastered on her cheeks . I 've lost my hat , ' she said , smiling up at him . It 's gone on downstream . ' That was pretty close , was n't it ? ' Yes . For God 's sake , watch your step , ' he warned her . Nowcome along ! ' She followed him , and her teeth chattered , for the cold plungehad chilled her through and through ; and the weight of her soaked and muddy garments wearied her , and their progress slowed ; and always the stream , swollen now into a hungry river , roared past just below them , like a shark which follows a steamer , rolling up a wicked eye at the passengers along the rail . The footing was so hazardous that any error could precipitate them to destruction , and Ellen thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they might not be able to win free from the hungry flood . At increasinglyfrequent intervals they paused to rest , their tortured lungs laboring , their bodies trembling with fatigue . But the air was warmer , and presently the sky blew clear and the sun blazed on the upper slopes so that rocks and mud alike seemed to steamand smoke . Also , the sun renewed their courage  --  and at the same time itwarned them that the afternoon was well-sped . Harland looked at his watch , and this time she asked a question , and he said it was almost five o'clock , and added urgently : Ca n't you travel anyfaster ? ' There was no reproach in her tones as she replied . I 'm sorry . I 'll try , ' she said . But she lagged , and he drew a few paces ahead , till reaching easier footing , he paused to wait for her . I 'm coming , ' she assured him ; but then she stepped on a stone which turned under her foot . She threw herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came quickly back to her . It 's nothing , ' she declared , but when she took a step she limpedand winced , and he said : I 'd better bandage that . ' I 'm afraid so , ' she confessed , catching her breath with pain . ' I do n't want to play out on you . But  --  what can you use ? ' My shirt ? ' he suggested . She nodded and sat down and loosed the laces of her shoe and stripped off her stocking , while he laid aside his fishing vest and removed his shirt and tore out the back of it as far up as the neck yoke , and ripped it into lengths . His body , bare to the waist , wet and shining when he took off his shirt , dried quickly in the sun , and the muscles in his arms slid smoothly under the smooth skin . When he knelt to apply the makeshift bandages , his water-logged hat hid his face from her , and because she wished to watch him she took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a question in his eyes . It 's so heavy , ' she said . Throw it away . ' She tossed it aside . How do I do this ? ' he asked . She told him how to place the bandages , and when they were affixed , he wrung her stocking as dry as possible , and with some difficulty , over the bulk of the bandages , she drew on her shoe and laced it tightly . He put on again the fragment of his shirt . It was whole in front and still had sleeves , but they laughed together at his appearance . It 's like a hospital night shirt , ' he suggested . She stood up to try her foot , facing him steadily . That feels fine ! ' she declared , and saw his quick approval of her sturdy courage . Thereafter he let her lead the way , and their progress slowed accordingly . Presently , as they worked along a rocky slope , she heard over the tumult of the brook a rumbling sound , and looked ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercutone of the perpendicular canyon walls which towered two hundred feet or more above the stream bed . This wall was a mixture of hard clay and shale and soft stone strata ; and when its foundations were gone , the face collapsed . Like the front of a glacier when it meets a river swollen with spring floods , it sheared off , leaned a little outward so that for an instant Ellen saw the sky through a widening crack high above them , and then crumbledlike a falling chimney , collapsing on itself , thousands of tons of debris smashing down into the gorge so violently that the earth trembled under the impact ; and the water geysered high as8 8 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 8 9though a charge of dynamite had been set off in the depths , and a mighty blast of air struck them , throwing them off balance so that they fell sprawling and clung to each other , still watching with staring eyes . Ellen , after the first moment of awed terror provoked by that majestic spectacle , saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penned here like flies in a stoppered bottle . The waters began at once to rise , the canyon to fill as rapidly as a goblet fills when it is held under a faucet . Harland shouted : We 've got to climb out of here ! Come on . ' He took her hand , and they clambered upward , the rising water close on their heels . Something like panic touched them both , and they made unnecessary haste , till , looking back and down , they saw that the water would soon top the great mound of earth which sealed the canyon , and their hands held fast as they paused to watch . The first trickle found a way across the barrier , and that trickle widened ; and as easily as a hot knife cuts through butter it cut down through the clam . They saw boulders as big as barrels swept away and submerged ; and abruptly the flood , making its own thanncl , began to fall again . It had broken through at a point on the opposite side from where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this side would for a while serve as a bridge which they could cross . To do so meant passing close under the face of the cliff from which the fall had come , and from which even now small clots of mud and rocks occasionally descended ; but if they waited till the loose stuff was all washed away , they might not be able to pass at all . They must cross while they could , and Harland told her so . We ca n't , possibly , ' she protested , holding fast to him , her teeth clicking with real terror now . We 've got to ! ' We 'll mire like flies on flypaper , ' she cried . Or another slide will bury us ! ' He gripped her hands so hard she thought the bones must break . We 're going , ' he told her strongly , and smiled and drewher toward him . We 'll make it , ' he said in calm certainty . It 's all right , Ellen . I 'll get you out of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the slope and began that dangerous passage . There was a moment when they sank knee deep in mud , and Ellen thought they were caught ; and a clod of dirt falling from a hundred feet above them landed so near that spattering particles stung their faces . But they crawled free of the muck and passed the face of the cliff and from a safe vantage looked back to see the last of their precarious footing , devoured by the hungry stream , dissolve and swirl away . He laughed aloud , in a high pride because he had beaten the enemy ; and because he could laugh at such a moment her heart swelled . I thought we were going to die together there , ' she said huskily . We 're all right ! ' he assured her . We 're going to make it . Ankle pretty bad ? ' It 's better all the time . ' If we ever come to anything like level ground , I can carry you . ' Exercise will do it good , ' she said , but that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , united by this which they endured . Behind them the sun dropped below the last ridge and was gone ; yet its rays still touched the loftier slopes above them , and though dusk began to fill the canyon , the sky was clear and fine . Ellen saw , too that the way was easier now , the footing more secure ; and the heights that walled them were no longer so abrupt . It was as though the mountains were relenting , relaxing their grasp , permitting these two small living creatures to escape . Yet full dark was almost come before the gorge widened out , and the violence of the stream , loosed from the canyon 's close constriction , began to ease . They followed its margin , and the farther shore was all an indistinguishable shadow , and they came into a little clump of aspens , and pushed through and found themselves among pines beyond . Here at last Ellen sank wearily down . I ca n't go any farther for a while , ' she said helplessly . Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 90 Leave Her to HeavenIt was almost dark among the pines , but the roar of the racing water no longer deafened them . Of course , ' he said . Be sure they will . Rest . I 'll see if I can start a fire . ' She remembered that Robie 's ranch lay to the northward , and they were on the south side of the brook , so rescue could not reach them till the flood ran off ; but she did not tell him so . On his knees , groping in the darkness , he collected by the sense of touch a supply of dead wood for his fire . He found none that was dry , but the small twigs of the pines would burn , wet or dry . When his wood was ready , he broke off a handful of these twigs from the lower branches of standing trees , and at last tried his matches . The first one started a little flame , but it died as soon as the match burned out . While she watched , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last it burned of itself . In five minutes thereafter he had a roaring bonfire , the sparks flying twinkling upward through the boughs overhead ; and he stood back and brushed his hands triumphantly . There ! ' he cried . Ellen , sitting near-by , facing the blaze , her shoulders resting against the trunk of a huge pine , smiled approvingly , looking all around . The flames pushed the darkness back  --  so far but no farther . At a little distance blackness ringed them still ; but the circle of firelight seemed to her almost palpable , as though it built a wall around them and a , roof over their heads , built a habitation in which they could rest secure . She was conscious of the weight of the vast wilderness in the heart of which by the fire-magic he had carved out a shelter for them both ; and she was happy in this sanctuary he had made . Her eyes turned back to him , and he asked : All right now ? How 's the ankle ? ' Fine , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the heat from the fire filled this circle from which the darkness was excluded . She was cold because she was wet through , as he was . You 'd better take off some of your clothes , ' he suggested . We 'll dry them ; and you 'll be warmer without them . even while they 're drying . ' Leave Her to Heaven 9uShe obeyed him without question , rising to step out of her skirt and hand it to him , and she gave him that bright-hued shirt she wore , sadly draggled and muddy now . He hung the garments so that they felt the heat of the flames , and his manner was wholly impersonal and reassuring . But what she did had for her a significance deeper than the simple , reasonable act itself . Under the circumstances , for her to remove her wet and sodden outer clothing was the sensible and the intelligent thing to do ; but because he was to her what he was , it seemed to her a symbolic gesture , as though she laid aside all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bower , and by doing what she did she surrendered herself to him  --  and bound him to her by that triumphant surrender . To Harland , clearly , the moment had no such connotation . Stand here by the fire till you 're warm , ' he advised , his tone completely matter-of-fact . She obeyed , turning back and front to the blaze ; but after a moment she said : It 's scorching me ! ' She went to the tree and sat down again , a small white huddle , hugging her knees , watching him with her heart in her eyes . He brought more wood and the flames leaped higher ; and he took off his fishing vest with the many pockets , feeling the weight of the trout which he had forgottenthere , and he exclaimed with a quick satisfaction : Here 's our supper anyway ! ' He laid the trout on the ground , and took off his ruined shirt and hung it to dry , and stood stripped to the waist , the firelight gleaming on his chest and flanks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world of their own , intimate and close as lovers , the fire on their hearthstone burning bright between them . Then , across the fire , through the tongued tips of the flames , their eyes met and held , and she gave him her eyes unmasked and full of yearning . They looked at each other for a long moment , neither speaking nor moving ; and then with her eyes she drew him so that he came around the fire to stand above her . She knew the hour she had dreamed was come . Her eyes still held his , insistent and compelling. 92 Leave Her to HeavenWith a low wordless cry Harland dropped on his knee . He set his hands on her bare shoulders , gripping hard , so that she felt his fingers bruise the soft flesh . She still watched him , eyes wide and waiting ; and he leaned down , and when he did so , her lips reached hungrily to his . He kissed her with a sort of violence , crushing her lips , lifting her close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tasted his lips against her teeth between her soft lips faintly parted . She threw her cool arms around his neck , tightening them there half stranglingly , holding him hard . He spoke against her lips , words without meaning , and her arms tugged harder ; but then her head fell back , and looking up at him , the firelight sending flickering shadows across her face , she spoke , low and tense and fiercely triumphant now . I will never let you go , ' she whispered . If in her word and in her eyes he saw something implacable and unyielding , so that for a moment he felt a deep alarm , she did not know it ; for in that instant from across the flood they heard a long halloo . Ilarland leaped to his feet to answer . The rescuers had come. - v - Ellen when she heard that distant halloo felt a jealous disappointment , wishing she and Harland might have had this hour alone ; but Harland hurried at once to the water 's edge to shout that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his side , the moon , almost at the full , had risen ; and now that the skies were clear the night was bright . She saw someone swimming his horse across to them , and she pulled Harland 's head down and kissed him and said laughingly : There ! Now I must go make myself decent ! ' She slipped away through the trees back to the fire , and Harlandwaited till Charlie Yates , bringing a vacuum bottle of coffee and a packet of sandwiches , reached the shore where he stood . When they came together to Ellen she was fully clad again . Leave Her to Heaven 93heCharlie said Robie and Lin were on the other bank , and that Robie had sent word back to the ranch that they were found ; and since the water now fell as swiftly as it had risen , the others were presentlyable to cross with the led horses , and with dry clothes for both Ellen and Harland which Mrs. Robie 's forethought had provided . They left Ellen by the fire to change again while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure ; and a little after midnight they came home to the ranch . When she heard Ellen was safe , Mrs. Berent , exhausted by her day in the saddle , had gone to bed ; but Ruth and Mrs. Robie and Tess were waiting . Ellen , overflowing with triumphant happiness that embraced all the world , kissed each one of them ; and she felt Ruth 's glad astonishment  --  it was years since they had kissed each other  --  and said in ironic apology : I 'm sorry , dear . It 's just that I 'm so happy ! ' She saw Ruth 's quick understanding , saw her look at Harland . Then Tess excitedly demanded to know all they had endured , and Ellen told the story of their arduous journey down the canyon , her eyes forever turning to Harland in proud possession . When she was done , Mrs. Robie said in a quiet concern : You must be tired after all that . I think we 'd better all go right to bed . ' Ellen nodded . Harland was beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll meet you at the pool at seven . ' Mrs. Robie said they might sleep late if they chose , but Ellen protested : Mercy , no ! I do n't want to miss any of our last day here . ' Her eyes met Harland 's once more as she turned with Ruth toward the stairs . Ruth said Mrs. Berent had bidden them wake her . When Ellensoftly opened the door , her mother snapped on the bedside light . Come in , come in ! ' she exclaimed . Do n't stand there whispering . ' Then as she saw them : Well , I see you 're not drowned ! You were bound to go . I hope you 're satisfied ! ' Oh , I am ! I am ! ' Ellen cried , her eyes dancing , looking towardRuth as though they shared a secret , and Mrs. Berent saw that glance. 94 Leave Her to HeavenEh ? ' she demanded . What are you grinning at ? You look like the cat that swallowed the canary . You 're practically lickingyour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can guess what you 've been up to ! Well ! I thought Mr. Harland had more sense ! ' Ellen laughed and leaned down to kiss her . You do n't fool me , darling , ' she said affectionately . I know you 're really as happy as I am  --  if only for my sake . ' And she told them both , lifting her arms , whirling around in a sort of dance , carolling in delight : Yes , it 's true ! It 's true ! It 's true ! It 's true , true , true ; and we 're going to be married right away , before we leave here , day after tomorrow ... ' She saw the travelling clock on the table by the bed . No , yesterday 's gone ! So we 're going to be married tomorrow morning ! ' Mrs. Berent , with a grim deliberation , sat up in bed to join battle . Now , Ellen Berent , you 'll do nothing of the kind ! ' she said flatly . Ellen was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all settled , ' she declared . Settled , my foot ! It 's not decent , Ellen . As good as engaged to one man and marrying another ! What does Mr. Harland say to that ? ' Ellen 's eyes twinkled . Oh , he does n't even know we 're going to be married in the morning . ' There was music in her tones and a singing in her veins . I have n't told him , but it 's settled all the same ! ' she cried . It 's not settled till I 've had my say ! ' her mother insisted strongly . Wait till fall and I wo n't say a word ; but I wo n't have this marry-me-quick business ! It looks too much like a force -- put ! ' Ellen felt her cheeks flush with the anger which opposition always roused in her . ' What will people say ? " ' she suggested in a light , scornful tone . Is that what worries you , Mother ? Have n't you any other standard ? ' It 's better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mrs. Berent retorted . You 've always done exactly as you chose , Ellen , but not this time ! ' Leave Her to Heaven 95Ellen hesitated , wishing it were possible to avoid an outright Jefiance . Do we have to quarrel tonight , Mother ? It 's the first time I 've ever been completely happy , like a brimming cup . Must you spoil it ? ' She looked at Ruth appealingly . The other : rirl sat on her bed , facing Mrs. Berent , and Ellen sought her supoort , sat down beside her and , as though unconsciously , caught her hand and held it . She knew Ruth 's capacity for affection , played upon it now . Do n't you want me to be happy , Mother ? Richardand I are just being sensible . His brother has infantile , and has to stay in Georgia , and Richard must go straight back to him ; and he needs me , and I need him . We want to be together ! I must go with him , Mother . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older woman was shaken , but as though to fortify her position Mrs. Berent cried : Want ! Want ! Want ! That 's all you ever think of , Ellen ; what you want ! What others want never means anything to you ! ' Ellen pressed Ruth 's hand , wishing the other would speak without prompting , would take her side . But Mother darling , pit 's my life , ' she urged . Mine and Richard 's . ' Mrs. Berent pleaded : Well , you 're my life , you and Ruth , Ellen . ' And she said weakly : All I 'm asking is that you wait a little , a few weeks , wait till fall . ' Her eyes filled . Ellen made an exasperated sound . Oh , for Heaven 's sake , do n't start sniffling , Mother . ' She rose , her voice hardening . ' There 's nothing to discuss , anyway . I 'm of age . But even if there were anything to talk about , crying would n't help . ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her now , bent and kissed her cheek and felt quick affection in Ruth respond to that caress , and thought in a derisive inner scorn that Ruth was like a dog which , no matter how many kicks it may have received , comes at a kind word , tail wagging , to its master 's hand . She played on the other 's hunger for her love . Make Mother see my point of view , Ruth , ' she urged . Ruth hesitated . Why Mother , ' she said honestly , I do think that if I wanted to marry a man , and he wanted to marry me , and people objected , I 'd think they were pretty unreasonable . ' 9 6 Leave Her to HeavenThere , you see , Mother ! ' Ellen cried . I want you to be married decently , at home , and not in such a tearing hurry ! ' Lovers arc always in a hurry , ' Ellen declared , laughing again . Love 's in a hurry , Mother , like a racing river . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted . Not this helter-skelter business ! ' Ellen faced her with hot eyes , hating these weak and ineffectualprotestations . Since her mother had to yield , why could she not surrender gracefully ? You know you ca n't prevent my doing as I choose , ' she said in icy tones . No , I never could . ' Then why not be nice about it ? Why make me unhappy when to do so ca n't accomplish anything ? ' Mrs. Berent looked at her for a long moment ; then she lay down and turned on her side , her back to them . Very well , ' she jaid grimly . You 've always had your own way . I ca n't expect you to change . I 'll dance at your wedding , my dear . ' VI - Ellen had hoped to he alone with Harland at the pool next morning ; but Robic and Tess and Lin appeared , and it was not till after breakfast that she was able to draw him away with her into the garden . When she told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranch , so that she could go to Georgia with him  --  he was surprised and doubtful ; but Ellen said surely : It 's so sensible , my darling ! Do you expect me to go back to Boston , to Bar Harbor , and let you go off to Georgia all alone ? Do n't be ridiculous ! For one thing , I want to see Danny , right away . I want to get to know him . I 'll sit with him , read to him , talk to him , keep him happy while you go back to your work again ; and when you 're through working every day , we can all be together . Wo n't that be fun ? You need me , darling ; and oh , I need you so . I want you so ! ' In his arms she whispered breathlessly , half-sobbing : I 'll die if we 're ever parted again ! ' She feltLeave Her to Heaven 97resistance in him still , and flooded him with tenderness that broke it down . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell him the truth . But of course , dearest ! . ' she assented . ' I was going to ! I 'll even let you read the telegram . Give me paper and pencil . I 'll write it right now ! ' He confessed that be had neither pencil nor paper , and she laughed at him . ' A fine author you are ! How do you ever expect to write anything ? ' I 've plenty in my room . ' Then we 'll go get them . ' She caught his hand and led him indoorsand upstairs , hurrying , hurrying , hurrying , deliberately giving him no time to make objections ; and when they were alone and the door was closed behind them , she kissed him in rapturous ardor , and felt triumphantly his full surrender . He gave her pen and paper , and she wrote a swift , scrawl : Find we made mistake . Marrying Richard Harland tomorrow . EllenShe turned to Harland . ' There ! ' she said . He read what she had written and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ellen , you do n't have to kick him in the teeth ! After all , the man loves you ! That ought to entitle him to some consideration . ' She challenged mischievously : Will you always be so considerateof my lovers ? ' Think how he 'll feel when he gets this ! ' I do n't seem to be able to think much about him , ' she admitted , her eyes full of tenderness ' You 've crowded everything else out of me , Richard ; everything but you , ' He took another sheet of paper , took the pen , ' I 'll write it , ' he decided , and sat down at the desk , and she perched on the arm of his chair , watching over his shoulder , He made one ok two false starts , wrote at last : I am terribly sorry and unhappy , Russ . Please believe me , and please forgive me . I know now that I never loved you . I98 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 99think it was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been friends . I know your generosity , know you will release me . I 'm not coming home , so we wo n't see each other for a long time . It is best this way , believe me , and good-bye . EllenWhen he finished , it was her turn to laugh . Mercy , you 're extravagant ! It will cost a fortune to send that . Do you always have to write a book to say what you mean ? Never mind , we can send it as a night letter ! She picked up the paper , read again what he had written . But Richard , this does n't sound a bit like me ! It 's so literary ! ' She added , smiling at him , teasing him : And you do n't mention yourself at all ? Skeered , Mister ? ' Leave me out ! That would just be rubbing it in . This gives him a chance to be generous , to release you . ' Her eyes narrowed thoughtfully . I do n't think Russ is particularlygenerous , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll send this if you say so , darling . Night letter ? ' No , ' he insisted , a telegram . ' Ile added : I 'd feel a lot better if we had an answer from him before  --  tomorrow . ' He wo n't give us his blessing , ' she warned him . Well , send it anyway . ' Aye , aye , sir . ' Shc kissed him , clinging to him , whispering ardently : My dear , dear man ! ' When the message was gone , Harland insisted that they seek her mother . Ellen had misgivings about that interview , but Mrs. Berent 's surrender of the night before had been complete . Take her and welcome , Mr. Harland , ' the old woman said , when he had spoken . And I wish you joy of her ! She 'll eat you alive and gnaw your bones ! ' Harland laughed , but Mrs. Berent did not . Ellen nibbled playfully at his cheek . See , I 'm beginning to eat you up already , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried : Now let 's go tell Mr. and Mrs. Robie . After all , if we 're going to be married in their house , they have a right to know ! ' She swept him away . When Robie heard what they planned , she saw his startled glance turn doubtfully toward Harland , buthe gave them congratulations , and Mrs. Robie met this emergency as she met all others , with at least outward composure . There was some talk of details , and Ellen , exactly sure what she wanted , made every decision . Watching Harland , she felt uneasy reluctancein him ; and she decided that he must have no chance to voice his misgivings . Robie said there was no minister in the little village near the ranch . The nearest was fifty miles away . ' But we can telephone him and he 'll be glad to come , ' he said . No , no , ' Ellen insisted . That 's not dignified . You and Richard drive over and talk to him . And you help Richard see about the license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' She thrust them toward the door . Go on , go on , ' she urged laughingly . She kissed Harland good-bye . That 's the last one till we 're married , darling , ' she warned him . You 're not supposed to see the bride before the wedding , you know ! ' So they drove away , and Ellen and Ruth and Tess and Mrs. Robie began to plan and to devise . Ellen wished to be married in the pergola by the pool , and Mrs. Robie said flowers must be found and arranged , and Ruth and Ellen discussed what Ellen should wear . They were busy all morning , and after lunch Ellen announced that she was exhausted and went to her room , excludingeven Ruth . Harland and Robie had not yet returned , and she was still alone there when Quinton 's telegram was telephoned from the station . Tess took it over the phone and brought it to Ellen . Quinton had wired : Refuse to accept your decision . Coming at once . Love . RussEllen read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Maybe I should n't have taken it , but I did n't know what it was . ' Then she asked in uncontrollable curiosity : Who is he , Ellen ? ' Ellen caught in her tone the accent of doubt , and for a moment there was an inner hardening in her . A man old enough to be my father , ' she explained . One of Father 's friends , in fact. 100 Leave Her to HeavenHe 's always insisted he 'd wait for me and marry me when I grew up , ever since I was a little girl . He even thinks we 're engaged 9 He gave me a ring I used to wear sometimes . ' I noticed it when you first came . ' He 's awful , ' Ellen assured her . Fat , and bald , and hairs in his nose ! ' Tess laughed gleefully at this description ; and Ellen remembered that Harland must not see the telegram , and she tore it across and across and tossed it aside . That for Mr. Quinton ! ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally : Tess , you must stay with me every minute from now on . There are people coming for dinner , are n't there ? ' Yes , Mother planned it a week ago . They 're just friends from the ranches around here , but that means some of them are driving a hundred miles . Of course she could call it off . ' No , she must n't ! That 's all the better ! But you be my chaperone , Tess . Do n't leave Richard and me alone a minute . ' Oh , the poor man ! ' I 'll make it up to him , ' Ellen declared . Maybe it 's a foolish notion , but  - -  brides have a right to have notions , do n't you thing ? So you stick to me like a burr ! Promise ? ' Tess was delighted to be a party to this conspiracy ; and she stayed with Ellen till time to dress for dinner . Harland , when he and Robie returned , came to the door and knocked ; but Ellen called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are busy . Did you get everything ? ' She felt his hesitation through the closed door . Yes , everything'sall set , ' he assented . Wonderful ! Then I 'll see you later . I love you . ' I  --  wanted to talk to you . ' We 'll have all our lives to talk together . ' Bye . ' She heard him go away , and Tess whispered , her eyes dancing : He sounded so forlorn ! ' He 's just scared , ' Ellen laughingly assured her . But bridegroomsalways are ! ' At dinner  --  Ellen had arranged this with Mrs. Robie  - -  Leave Her to Heaven i o is he and Harland were seated the length of the table apart ; but Robie announced their plans , and invited everyone to stay for the wedding , and toasts were drunk to them , and Harland and then Ellen responded . But Ellen was thinking of Quinton , wonderinghow he would come , whether he would fly , how soon he would arrive ; and she was desperate with haste . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side ; and almost at once she excused herself , turning away upstairs . Harland saw her move away and came after her ; but Ellen  --  holding fast to Tess  --  told him smilingly : No , you must n't , dearest ! It is n't done ! ' She kissed him Ughtly . There ! Au revoir , my darling . ' When her door was closed , she leaned against it , shivering , her teeth chattering ; and Tess was half-frightened , coming close to her , holding both . her hands . But after a moment Ellen was her self again . It 's all right , Tess , perfectly all right , ' she said breathlessly . I 'm excited , of course ; but that 's all ! ' She caught the ; younger girl , kissed her . Thank you for everything . I 'm all right now . Good night , my dear . ' So she sent Tess away , and for precaution 's sake she locked her door , drawing back from it warily as though outside it there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stripped off her garments , hurried into bed . Belowstairs she could hear the murmur of voices , and later there was music and she caught the hushed whispers of feet as they danced , and someone strolled out to the pool below her windows , and she heard laughter in the night . By and by someone knocked at her door , and she answered drowsily , and Ruth asked whether she could do anything , and Ellen murmured : No thanks , darling . I was asleep . Good night ! ' But she did not sleep till the house was quiet ; till the guests were gone . They were married while the sun was still low in the eastern sky , under the pergola by the pool as Ellen had wished . Robie lent them one of his cars for the first stage of their departure . ' Leave it anywhere you like , ' he said generously . Just send me a102 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 103wire where to fmd it . I 'll have someone pick it up . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back , waving as long as there was anyone to see . Then she sighed with a great relief , and slipped her hand through Ilarland 's arm . There ! ' she exclaimed . That was n't so bad , was it ? ' IIe touched her hand affectionately , but after a moment he said in a regretful tone : I 'm sorry there was no word from Quin-ton . ' I suppose , ' she suggested , he was off fishing or something , did n't get my wire . ' - VIITheirroom in the hotel at Taos faced the west , and Ellen waked at first dawn and lay for a while , blissfully happy , serene and fulfilled . As the light crept into the room she looked at Harland , still asleep , sprawling like a child ; and she was content for a while to watch him , studying the shape of his head , the contourof his shoulders , the way his fingers curled over his upturned palm , loving all of him . But at length she sat up to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . The world lay in the cool shadow of dawn , still undefined and featureless ; but as she watched , a rosy light began to fill the sky beyond those remote mountains , bringing them to life as a dark silhouette against that brightness . Then sunlight touched their peaks , tipping them with crimson . The sun was rising behind Taos and behind Ellen as she watched , its rays , diffused through earth mists , lancing across the sky above the village to lift those ranges yonder into the clay . The sunlight flowed down the flanks of the distant mountains till they were all in brightness , and their rocky slopes and shadowedgorges formed a pattern of changing color which seemed to Ellen wondrously enchanting . Then the coming day began to race toward her , as though this sunrise came from the west insteadof from the east . The illumination revealed in turn eachsuccessive fold of the rolling desert , and each fold was gray-brown in the dusk of dawn till at the sun 's touch it showed pink and crimson with shadow patterns for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the miracle continued , the desert was barred by bands of color changing constantly . Ellen had seen northern lights play across the autumnal skies , and except for their greater brilliance these colors changed and altered in the same way , manipulated by some Godlike hand , as though God himself experimented , laying His pigments across a palette , considering which to use to adorn the world for this newborn day . There was in the spectacle something sublime and breath-taking , and Ellen 's eyes filled ; but then she smiled , and asked herselfhappily whether yesterday she would have been as deeply moved by this beauty as she was today . Since she first knew Harlandshe had been intensely aware of all the living world , her senses sharpened and responsive to every stimulus ; but there had been in that awareness a restless questioning , an eager hunger . Now she was at once more awake than she had ever been in her life before and at the same time more at peace . Watching the spectacle that progressed outside her window , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun and pull it down to warm the earth , as a sleeper 's hand reaches for a coverlet when night takes on a sudden chill , must be scores of miles away ; for the sunlight which raced toward her was not yet near at hand . She had no impulse to wake Harland , content to have this moment to herself ; but when at last the desert was all bright , she lay down again , stretching luxuriously , her arms extended over her head , her legs at full reach , her toes pointed , deliciously conscious of every muscle and sinew and of every drop of blood in her body , feeling herself complete , perfected , attuned to life and to the world . She turned on her side to look across at her husband , watching him with a proud triumphant smile ; and she thought in a blissful peace : Mine , mine , mine ! There 's nothing in my world but you , Richard ; and there 's nothing in your world but me ! ' Yet after a moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She remembered Danny ; Danny who was ill , crippled , his legs shrunken and distorted ; Danny who was a maimed and ugly thing . The thought of him thus deformed made her shudder as one shudders when a snake with a broken back writhes in the dust . IIcr eyes narrowed , and her brows drew together in a thin frown . She had cast out of her life her mother , and Ruth , and Quinton , so that all her life now was Richard 's . But would he ever cast out his love for Danny , so that he could be altogether hers ? She lay for a long time , fixed in thought , till she was cold as ice ; and she shivered faintly , and with a sudden movement then she sat up and took her pillow in both hands and flung it at Harland'shead . He roused with a startled grunt , and she leaped out of bed and pounced upon him , catching his ears in her hands , thumping his head on the pillow , laughing at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleepy head ! Pay attention to me Pay attention to me ! ' 4FOR AS LONG as he could remember , Danny Harland had been sure that his big brother was one of the lesser gods . Even while he himself was still almost a baby , Dick had treated him as an equal , sharing his enthusiasms and interesting himself in the things which interested Danny . Dick was so wonderful that Danny was a little shy with him . When they met after any separationhe wished to throw himself into the other 's arms and hug him rapturously ; but for fear Dick might not like that , he assumed a mature dignity , and they met with a firm handclasp , greeting each other as man to man . He had always felt nearer to Dick than to his mother ; and after her death the two brothers drew closer still , and sometimes when they were together , if Dick were reading or otherwise absorbed , Danny might just watch him with wide eyes , thinking happily how wonderful he was , humbly praying that he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , they had been comrades , and Dick never seemed to remember that he was so many years the older ; but afterward there was a deep , almost maternal tenderness in Dick , and whenever he came to where Danny lay he bent down to kiss him  --  although they had seldom kissed before  --  and these caresses and this loving kindness made Danny so blissfully content that he sometimes thought it was worth being sick , to find out Dick loved him so . At the same time , because he knew how Dick grieved and worried over him , he took pains to be jolly and cheerful whenever they were together , making light of any discomfort he suffered , meeting this catastrophe which hadI05i o6 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 107 , struck him down with a high valor that was so complete it never seemed to be what it was . Once  --  his hearing was keener now than it had been  --  he heard his nurse say to Dick in the hall outside his dour : He 's so brave sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard Dick 's reply : He 's so brave he never lets you see he 's being brave ! ' Danny was mighty proud when he heard that . It had not occurred to him that he was brave . IIe was simply making things as easy as possible for Dick . If thereafter his courage ever failed or weakened , he had only to remember that overheard conversation to be strong again . When the acute stage of his illness had passed , and Dick told him that they would go south to a place called Warm Springs where he might be helped toward complete recovery , Danny dreaded leaving home ; but Dick saw his fears and banished them . I 'll be with you there just as much as I am here , Danny , ' he promised , and grinned reassuringly . You and I are always going to stick together . ' Is it a hospital ? ' Danny asked dubiously ; but Dick said : No . The people there are n't sick . You 're not sick yourself , now , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , busy gettingwell . ' So Danny was reconciled . The long trip by train tired him ; but at the Foundation , set high enough in the hills to be cool even in summer , with loftier mountains visible in the distance , he was soon happily content . It was , he told Dick , almost like New England . He would he for a long time unable to move about without assistance , and he must endure a wearying routine of medication , minor corrective surgery and weeks of immobilization in plaster casts and splints before the underwater physical therapy which would follow ; but Dick was with him , living in one of the small housekeeping cottages near-by , bringing him many bright surprisesday by day . Ile looked forward to Dick 's appearances , and when they were together he watched the other so closely , attentive not only to Dick 's words but to every shade of expression in his tones and every shadow in his eyes , that he saw how concern and sorrowwore upon his brother ; and when , not long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to New Mexico arose , Danny was completely and wholeheartedly delighted , refusing to think how lonely he himself would be while the other was gone . But after Dick 's departure he was at first sick with longing for him , sobbing heartbrokenly through silent night hours when he could not sleep , lying with dry , blank eyes through the long empty days . Then little by little his spirits rose again , and he remembered that Dick would soon return , and that he himself must have progress to report ; and this necessity of getting better as fast as he could for Dick 's sake made him presently forget his loneliness . He read Dick 's New Mexico letters over and over , devouring every word . In the second letter he was puzzled by something he sensed but could not define ; for it did not sound like Dick . The first , written on the train , full of squiggles and little comic sketches , had made him laugh till he cried , and that sounded like Dick all right ; but the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least none that were particularly funny ; and Danny had , when he read it , a curious feeling that Dick was holding somethingback ; that there was something on the tip of Dick 's tongue  --  or the tip of his pen  --  which he was always about to write and never did . There was a quality Dick put into his books , of which Danny was perhaps the most ardent reader . Without ever actually saying so , Dick in his novels always made you feel that something tremendously important and interesting was just about to happen . Danny got the same feeling from Dick 's letters now , and he found them a little frightening . But as the time for Dick 's return approached , Danny lost himself in excited anticipation , counting the days . He woke one morning full of happiness , and for a moment could not remember why he was so happy ; and then as he came wide awake he recalledthat today Dick would leave the ranch and start the return journey back to him . Day after day after tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so merry all that day that the nurses teased him o8 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 109 about his love for Dick , declared he was as excited as a girl wait- ing for her sweetheart ; but Danny laughed at their teasing , en- joying it , thinking from hour to hour : Now he 's left the ranch ! Now he 's on the train to the junction ! Now he 's on the train for Chicago ! ' Ile lay awake that night , unable to sleep , counting to himself every turn of the wheels which brought Dick nearer and nearer ; and he hummed to himself that song which the wheels sang in Kipling 's story , and which so exactly fitted the sound of a racing train . It was like a lullaby . He hummed himself to sleep . Next morning there was a letter from Dick , which had come by air mail , and when the nurse put the envelope in his hands Danny 's heart quickened with an instant alarm ; for the envelope was a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter on the eve of his departure from the ranch . The boy tore off the end of the envelope and found half a dozen closely scribbled sheets in Dick 's small , regular hand ; and he began eagerly to read . Dear Danny  --  This is going to be in some ways a hard letter to write , and I wish it did n't have to be written , wish I could be there to tell you my fine new s instead of writing it . Danny 's breath caught at that . It had an alarming sound ; but the next sentence began to reassure him . For it is the best of news I have to tell you , Danny . I 'm going to be married tomorrow morning , to  --  as the fellow said  --  the most wonderful girl in the world . ' Only in this case it happens to be true . We 'll be married in the morning and leave here at once , and have a few days together before we come back to you . It wo n't be long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know you 'll be disappointed just at first , because you 'll be expecting me about the time you get this ; but I know you 'll forgive us . You know how honeymoons are . We have n't decided yet just where we 'll go ; but it will only be for a few days , that 's sure . Danny muttered weakly : Gosh ! ' The letter slipped from his hand and he stared at nothing , and for a moment he had again that terrible sense of aloneness which had oppressed him when Dick went away . If Dick were married , probably things would be mighty different between them from now on . But of course he wanted Dick to be in love and married and happy . He picked up the letter again . Well , now you want to know all about her . Her name 's Ellen Berent , and she 's lived all her life on . Mount Vernon Street and at Bar Harbor in the summer . It seems impossible that she and I never met before ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my letters , though I may not have told you her name . She was the girl on the train . Remember ? And she went with me the day I shot the wild turkey . She 's done a lot of hunting and fishing with her father , and she 's about the loveliest thing you can imagine . She and . in are fine friends , and I know you and she will be . Danny looked up from the letter again , staring at the wall of his pleasant , sunny room , wondering how it would seem to have Dick loving someone else , wondering whether he himself would like her as Dick expected . Even if he did n't , of course , he would have to pretend to like her very much , because it would make Dick unhappyif he did n't . He licked his lips and swallowed hard and for a moment he was just a frightened , sick little boy ; because of course he would never again have Dick all to himself .. But then he set his jaw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was glad , mighty glad , because Dick now would be so happy . He read on . There was more and more about Ellen . At the last , Dick described the trip down the canyon , and the hardships and the dangers he and Ellen endured together . For of course it really was dangerous , ' he explained . Things might have gone badly wrong . ' And he concluded : Something happened to me on the way avwn the canyon . I had liked Ellen before that , and yet I had felt a certain antagonismtoward her too , for no reason , except that I was at 10 Leave Her to Heaven I Leave Her to Heaven i i aconfirmed old bachelor , and bachelors always shy off from any sort of matrimonial pitfall . But before we came to the end of our journey it seemed to me that she and I were , in all the ways that mattered , already married , and that she was the bravest and finest and alto- gethcr the most desirable woman in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way about me . Maybe it 's a conceited thing to say , Danny , but I think she 's quite as much in love with me as I am with her . For instance , my idea would have been to wait till you could be at our wed- ding ; but she does n't want to wait . To wait would mean her going back to Boston and my going back to you , and our not seeing each other for weeks or months ; but she 's anxious to come with me , and to know you , and I 'm anxious for you to know her . And neither of us wanted to wait . We 'll be married here tomorrow morning , and Glen Robie is lending us a car , and we 'll drive away somewhere for a day or two and then start to come to you . Be ready with a big welcome for us , Danny . I want you to be as happy as I am . It will be three of us instead of only two , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . We both send love , and well see you soon . Dick Danny read that letter slowly , devouring every word ; and he grinned at Dick 's happiness , and he thought Dick sounded dif= ferent already , younger , gay and merry and more like a boy than a man . There were two or three passages which , to his sharpened and sensitive mind , seemed a little as though Dick were trying to reassure himself ; but Danny decided that was just his imagina- tion . Certainly Dick would not have married anyone unless he wanted to very much indeed ; so Ellen was bound to be all right . He told the nurses and the doctors , joyfully , the news . Lis- ten ! Is n't this wonderful ? Dick 's married ! To a girl out there ! They 're coming right on here ! ' He even read them parts of Dick 's letter , telling who she was and what she was like , telling the story of the adventure in the canyon . But he saw their ex- change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were thinking , because of course they knew how much Dick meant to him . So to make them see that he did not feel badly , he put on an excessive enthusiasm , insisting over and over on his delight . But when he was left alone , his eyes shadowed with doubts . Would Dick love him as much as ever , come to see him as often , stay as long ? Would she like him  --  or would she resent Dick 's devotion to him ? After all , you could n't blame her for not wanting Dick tied down , forced to stay near a sick , crippled , bedriddenboy who could n't do anything ; who could never do anythingagain except perhaps lurch around on crutches , and sit in a wheel chair , and , of course , swim . It was only his legs that were useless , and when he was a little stronger lie would be able to swim with his arms , and they said he could even use his legs in swimming , too . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Dick said she was pretty , and probably she liked good times , parties and dances and fishing trips and travelling . And naturally she would n't ever love him as Dick did . Maybe Dick would leave him here among strangers  --  who were as nice as they could be , of course  --  and take her home to Boston , take her next summer to Back of the Moon , take her fishing at Anticosti , take her with him to all the places to which he and Danny had planned to go . That would be pretty terrible , but he must n't let them know he minded . just because he was crippled , that did n't mean he had any right to boss their two lives . He would send them away to have their good times together , just as he had sent Dick away this summer . Only perhaps when he was stronger he could sometimes go with them and not be too much of a bother . He would be able to walk on crutches by then , and perhaps after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't have to be able to walk , to write books . During the next two or three days Danny convinced himself that he could avoid hindering their happiness . No one wanted an invalid hung around his neck all the time , and he certainly did n't want to be a burden to them . They would be happy , and so would he. 1 12 Leave Her to HeavenOne evening a telegram announced they would arrive next day . As long as the hour of their coming had been uncertain , Danny had been able to think pretty clearly and to plan how gladly he would greet them , so that not even Dick should guess the terror he had felt ; but now in the imminence of their arrival he was just plain scared again ! If she were the sort of girl some men thought beautiful , all made up , with red fingernails and a red mouth , it would be pretty awful . During the daylight hours before they came , he lay still , trembling terribly , perspiring , cold with lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Dick 's voice along the corridor , heard them coming nearer and nearer his door , he shut his eyes tight , dreadfully afraid that he was going to cry ; and he did not open his eyes again till they were in the room . Then he saw Dick , and instantly the fear all went out of him ; for Dick looked so well , fit and lean and strong ; and Dick 's eyes were clear and bright , and his whole face was different , glowing with a transfiguring peace and content . Then Dick bent over him , saying huskily , Hi , Danny ! ' and leaning down to kiss him ; and Danny flung his arms around Dick 's neck and hugged him tight , and they were both laughing with tears in their eyes , Danny 's small body straining up to Dick 's ; and oh , but Dick felt good in his arms ! Then Dick said : And here she is , Danny ! ' He still held Danny with one arm , sitting on the edge of Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers and drew her near . This is Ellen , Danny . ' Danny looked at her , suddenly shy , conscious of the fact that he was in his nightgown , swept by the modest embarrassment of which only a boy of thirteen is capable . She was so wonderfully beautiful , just as Dick had said ; but Danny was terribly afraid she would make a fuss over him , call him , You poor boy , ' or kiss him or gush over him or something . But she did n't ! She just held out her hand and said , Hi , Danny ! ' exactly as Dick had done , and he gripped her hand gratefully , and said : Good morning , Ellen . ' And he smiled a little , and she smiled ; and he knewLeave Her to Heaven 113at once that she was all right , and that he was going to love her just as much as Dick did. - II - That winter was for Danny so brimming with happiness that there was a singing in him all day long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought or seemed to bring some small measure of new strength to his wasted legs . He gained victories in the battle to recapture as much of life as he could ever hope to seize ; and in addition he could watch and share in the enriching happiness which Dick and Ellen found together , Just to see them was like swallowing a great draft of delicious , warming wine . They seemed to shine . Their eyes were bright and clear , the whites faintly tinged with blue ; their smooth cheeks were full and glowing ; their heads were high and laughter sang in their tones and in their every word . They walked togetherthrough the world as though the world were theirs and all desired things in it ; and Danny took Ellen into his heart to share 1 Dick 's place there , because she and Dick were so clearly one . It was as Dick had promised it would be . There were three of them now , and life was twice as much fun as when there had been only two . Dick was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had laid aside when Danny fell ill and to which since then he had not turned at all . To it he gave every morning ; but Ellen came to Danny as early as the routine of his treatment would permit and stayed with him till Dick appeared . Then they were all a while together , till Dick took Ellen away to lunch . In the afternoons , as soon as Danny was well enough , and if the day were fine , they drove for hours ; and they were sometimes grave and serious together , having long talk of people and of places , of passions and of power , of the thoughts in a man 's head and of the serenity that underlay the scurry of the world . But on other days they were gay and jolly , talking nonsense and laughing all together , not because what they said was particularly funny , butII4 Leave Her to Heavenbecause they were happy and this happiness could become a merry madness with no sense in it at all . When Ellen and Danny were alone , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never hear enough of him she loved ; and Danny liked nothing better than to talk to her endlessly about this big brother of his , searching back through his life under her hungry questions for every smallest memory . More than once he said laughingly : Gosh , you just want to know all about him , do n't you ? ' and she nodded , smiling , her eyes shining . M-hm , ' she assented , through closed lips . Yes , I do . I 'm jealous , you see ! I 'm terribly jealous of all the years when I did n't know Richard , and of all the people who did know him then , and of everything he did and said and thought from the very first , when he was a baby . So now tell me .... ' And she winnowed his memory with a wind of questions . Danny had heard his mother tell anecdotes of Dick 's childhood , and he had to repeat them all to Ellen now . She wished to know what Dick had looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Danny had seen pictures of him and tried to describe them , and he promised to find these old photographs when they all went back to Boston together . She asked about their house in Boston , and about the cabin at Back of the Moon ; and Danny told her how beautiful the lake was , and he told her about Leick who always took care of him and Dick there , and he told her about the trout brook that flowed into the lake , and about the great trout which the lake itself occasionally yielded , if you knew just where to drop your fly , above the spring hole where the water was icy cold . Her appetite for these details was insatiable . I bet you just ask so many questions because you know I love to talk about Dick , ' he said one day , and she answered with a laughing intensity : No ! I do n't do it for you . I do it for myself ! I want every bit of him , of his whole life ! I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always talk about Dick . She told him about herself , and about her father , and about all the things they hadLeave Her to Heaven 115used to do together ; and she might read to him for hours on end . Her low musical tones were sweet and pleasing to his ear , so thatsometimes he forgot to listen to what she read , content to watchher , to watch the sun in her hair and glinting on her cheek , towatch her lips move as she shaped the words , and her breast stir with her easy breathing , and the way her hair lay across her brow . Sometimes she caught him at this , and laughingly protested that he was not listening ; and he grinned redly and confessed : I forgot to ! Just looking at you is more fun than any book . ' He thought he could never have imagined anyone so completely beautiful and so altogether charming as she was . These two began to have small secrets , plans designed for Dick 's pleasure and delight , which they concerted between them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfulsurprise . Thus when Danny began to practice on his crutches they did not tell Dick , till one day Danny , already up and dressed and ready when they heard Dick coming , went proudly on his crutches to meet Dick at the door ; and Dick was so surprised that for a moment he could not speak , and his eyes filled , and he and Danny and Ellen all had a good laughing cry together ! There were other such surprises , though there were none so big as that one . Danny 's strength , in arms and body9 was slowly returning , and he now swam regularly in the pool ; and one day he and Ellen planned that next summer at Back of the Moon , if the doctors would let him go there , he would practicetill he was strong and then some day he would swim clear across the lake ! They decided not to tell Dick beforehand , but just do it and surprise him . There was only one break in that happy winter . In February , Mrs. Berent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Dick and Ellen decided to go down for a week end with them . Danny , when they asked his consent , felt a secret pang ; but he stifled it . He must never let them see that he was unhappy when they went away . So he told them to go , to stay as long as they wished ; and Dick asked doubtfully : ' Are you sure you mean it , youngster ? I hate leaving you eveny16 Leave Her to Heaven for a day ; and if you feel the same way about having us go , just : say the word and we 'll stay right here ! ' Danny hesitated , and he was tempted ; but then he saw that Ellen wanted to go , so he laughed at Dick and said jocosely  --  ' Nuts to you ! I can get along without you , all right ! Do n't think you 're so darned important ! Give them my love . I 'll bet they 're swell ! ' He was as convincing as possible , and he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thoughtful still . They had expected to be three days gone , but Dick telephoned Monday morning to ask whether it was all right for them to stay on another day or two , and Danny said of course it was . Yet he reflected miserably , after Dick had hung up : Maybe he 'll call up again and say they want to stay even longer . Maybe they 'll stay away a week , or a month . Maybe they wo n't ever come back at all ! ' But he told himself he was a darned fool to think such things9 and sure enough , on Wednesday evening they returned , brown from the sun , and Danny thought they were the two most beau- tiful and wonderful people he had ever seen . In March tuth and Mrs. Berent , driving north on a leisurely schedule , stopped over for a week end at the hotel ; and Danny found Mrs. Berent and her sharp tongue tremendously funny .. Tae liked Ruth too . She 's not as pretty as you are , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she certainly is swell ! You can feel a sort of warmness in her , feel her liking you . Dick likes her a lot , does n't he ? ' Yes , of course , ' Ellen agreed . Ruth 's sweet as she can be ! ' But he felt she was sorry he had liked Ruth , and . he wondered why.  --  III In the back of Danny 's mind , as winter turned to spring and the early southern summer began to flow richly across the hills , lay single question : Would he be well enough to go this summer with Leave Her to Heaven 11Dick and Ellen to Back of the Moon ? At first , he and Ellen had often talked about the camp there . Danny loved the place , and liked to tell her about it ; but little by little , because he was thinking of it so constantly , and hoping so dreadfully that he could go with them , he put a seal on his lips and never spoke of it unless she or Dick led him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he had ever wanted anything in the world . Everyone here was wonderful to him , and he was grateful to them , but it was n't like being at home ; and Back of the D1oon , though they had nevez done more than spend there some of the summer months , was home to him much more truly than the house in Boston . Yet no matter how much he wanted to go , if it were best for him to stay here he would stay and not complain and never let anyone know his longing . This was his determination and he held to it ; and when Back of the Moon was mentioned he was care ful not to allow his eagerness to appear . Sometimes when they were all three together , Dick talked te , Ellen about Back of the Moon , telling her its charms , describing the routine of their lives there ; but as summer drew near , Dick and Ellen began to avoid the subject , and Danny knew this meant there was doubt whether he would be well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race against an opponent whom he could not see , so that he could never be sure whether he were ahead or behind , gaining or losing ground . The worst of it was that this was a race in which the harder you tried , the more poorly you ran . To get better , it was necessary to be calm and serene , and to do what he was told , neither more nor less ; and this was hard when he felt all the time that he must hurry , hurry , hurryThen one day when he and she were alone together , Ellen brought up the subject which filled his thoughts so constantly . ' I want to talk to you about something , Danny dear , ' she said tenderly . He knew what was in her mind even before she went on : ' It 's about this summer . ' He did not speak , and she took his hands in hers , leaning near him , and explained : ' You see , Richard is homesick for Back of the Moon . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her to Heaven 119here , but now he 's beginning to bog down . The novel is n't going so well . Ile needs to go back there where he loves to be , to go at it fresh and renewed again . ' Danny nodded . Sure , ' he agreed , and kept his voice as steady as he could . Dick always got more work done there than anywhereelse ! ' But you see , ' she confessed . He hates leaving you here , so far away ; and Doctor Mason is n't sure the life there would be the best thing for you . ' Danny wetted his lips . I thought I was getting along pretty well . ' You are , darling , ' she assured him . But that 's a rugged life up there  --  and a hard trip in . You 'd have trouble getting up and down those steep paths on your crutches . Richard says he and Leick can carry you , but I 've told Doctor Mason about the place , how far it is from the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . ' He wished she had n't told Doctor Mason that . Richard does n't realize how hard it will be for you , ' she went on . And how hard it will be for him and Leick , taking care of you . ' I guess it would be pretty bad , all right . ' He spoke in careful tones . Of course , ' she added , Richard hates to leave you , thinks you 'd be unhappy here alone ; but I know how brave you are , and I know how you love Richard , and I know you want him to do what 's best for him and for his work . ' Sure ! ' She kissed him fondly . You 're sweet , Danny ! If it tunas out that you 'd better stay here , you 'll make Richard go , just the same , wo n't you ? And we 'll all be together again in the fall , when we come back down here . ' There was a lump like a rock in his throat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Sure ! I 'm fine here . This is the place for me , all right , till I get so I 'm not such a bother to people . ' She told him he was wonderful , brave and strong as a man ; but he was glad she did not kiss him again , for if she had , he would certainly have cried . There was a wail of terror in hisHeart ; and he told himself hopelessly that if Dick and Ellen , who were all his world , went away and left him here , he would surely die . After that day , no matter how hard he tried , he could not be as jolly and as gay as he wanted to be for Dick . Then one day Doctor Mason came to him and talked with him for an hour , wisely and gently , probing with delicate questions . He was a man full of understanding , as much concerned with the minds of his patients as with their bodies . Danny , thinking of Ellen , leaned backward to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Moon , till the doctor said in tones curiously stern : You must n't feel that Mrs. Harland does n't want you with them there , Danny . ' Oh , I do n't , ' Danny cried . I know she 's just thinking what 's best for me . ' The doctor smiled , and he led Danny to tell him about the cabin and the lake , and about the things he and Dick had used to do there ; and as Danny talked his eyes began to shine again . Doctor Mason watched him and listened to him and made him talk on and on , and once he said : You and Dick have always had a lot of fun together , have n't you ? ' We sure have , ' Danny agreed . We 've hardly ever been separatedsince my mother died . ' The doctor nodded , his eyes almost grim . I do n't think it would be good medicine to separate you now . No matter what anyone says ! ' Danny thought he seemed to be talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're better just from talking about it . ' He asked with a quizzical smile : Suppose I made you stay in bed , take a good rest for a few days ? Would you mind ? ' No , sir , ' Danny told him . I 'll do whatever you say . ' His heart pounded with happy understanding . That afternoon he heard Dick and Ellen arrive , heard their voices in the corridor ; but then one of the nurses spoke to them in a low tone , and instead of coming straight to Danny they went120 Leave Her to Heavenaway from him toward Doctor Mason 's office . A little late ! Danny heard them coming , heard Dick walking fast and eagerly , and his throat filled with a deep excitement , and then they ap- peared in the door . Ellen stayed there , watching these two ; and Danny saw her over Dick 's shoulder and he had never seen her look as she was looking now . There was something puzzlingly like anger in her eyes . But then he forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Danny , old man , take care of yourself , this next week . Store up a lot of strength ! Because a week from today we 're starting for Back of the Moon ! ' Danny 's eyes filled . Oh golly , golly , golly ! ' he whispered in breathless happiness , grinning from ear to ear . Dick laughed aloud , and then Ellen came to Dick 's side , her eyes now alight with fondness , and she said tenderly : Is n't that wonderful , Danny dear ? ' 5DURING those months  --  almost a year  --  at Warm Springs , Harland was like a man intoxicated . Ellen fitted herself to his moods as a dog does to its master 's wishes , eager to do with him whatever he wished to do , equally happy to be idle with him at his desire . He discovered new wonders in her every day . Het beauty was a continuing delight , yet even in their richest hours , with the impersonal mind of the novelist he sometimes thought their roles were reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consenting mistress ; that her passionate abandonments were more profound than his . She might be lost in ardent raptures while he was almost calm , and to see her thus moved filled him with a proud tenderness . She recognized this difference , said more than once , after a lavish yielding : I love you so much more than you love me , Richard . If you ever stopped loving me , I 'd die . And I 'd want to die ! ' This was true of her , yet he knew  --  with a faint sense of guilt  --  that it was not true of him . Most men , he suspected , were or might be self-sufficient ; it was women who lived to the utmost only through surrender  --  which was at the same time possession . His life after their marriage took on a new dimension , and  --  the creative instinct in him again awake  --  he turned to his work with a keen zest he had never known , and with a fecundity of invention so greatly increased that it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pattern of human life complexities he had not hitherto suspected , and he began to corn-I2I12 2 Leave Her to HeavenLeave Her to Heaven I23prehend emotional depths which till now had seemed to him unreal , theatrical , factitious . His hours at his desk were filled with a high excitement , his hours with her were wholly contenting . Only rarely ( lid any shadow cloud their days . Once she asked , as though wishing to be reassured : Am I all right with Danny , Richard ? ' Wonderful , ' he assured her . Sometimes I just hate him , ' she confessed , only half-jesting . ' He 's had so much of you that I can never have . ' He laughed teasingly . Ellen the Desirous ! Never satisfied . ' Then , suddenly husky : When I watch you with him , I 'm always imagining what you 'll be like with our own sons . ' She asked , her eyes searching his : You want a son , do n't you , Richard ? ' Some day , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . ' Then she caught him fiercely close . But not soon , Richard ! ' she whispered . I want you all to myself for a while . No one else ! Just us two ! Just you and me ! ' He held her strongly . Just us two ! ' he assented . And , ofcourse , Danny . ' Oh , of course ! ' She spoke without emphasis . There was often this disturbing flatness in her voice when they discussed Danny . We 're all he 's got in the world , you know , ' he reminded her in steady warning . We 've got to stand by ! ' She laughed and kissed him . Do n't worry , darling . I love himas you do , my dear . ' - II -A later incident made him remember the brief misgiving he had felt that day . They had left Danny for the Sea Island week end with her mother and Ruth , and he found Mrs. Berent 's tongue as sharp as ever . Well , Mr. Harland , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented , when they arrived , anc Harland laughed and said : No . Being married to this daughter of yours has been prett ) tough sometimes , but so far I 've been able to stand it . ' He dropped his arm affectionately around Ellen 's waist , and she clasped his hand with hers , pressing his against her side . I have n't begun to bite any pieces out of him yet , ' she assured her mother ; and the older woman made a stubborn sound . Time enough ! ' she declared . You will ! ' She told them at dinner that evening that Quinton had arrived at the ranch a few hours after their departure . He came breathingout threatenings and slaughter , ' she declared . If you 're wise , Ellen , you 'll not cross his path again . ' Harland was troubled . Why did n't he answer your wire , Iwonder ? ' he asked Ellen , and he saw her mother look at her sharply . He did , Richard , ' Ellen said at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Robie were off after the preacher . ' Harland started to speak , then held his tongue ; yet he felt Mrs. Berent 's sharp eyes upon him , and when he and Ellen were alonehe said : See here , Ellen , you did n't tell me about any telegram from Quinton . ' She smiled . Poor darling ! And I made you back me up when I fibbed to Mother , did n't I ? Did your New England consciencehurt ? Mother 's always been a troublemaker , Richard . We 'll have to teach her not to interfere . ' What did Quinton go out there for ? ' To forbid the banns , I suppose ! Russ is a hard loser . Forgive me ? I could n't have him bothering us . I 'd made up my mind I wanted you , you see ; so talk would have done no good . ' Seeing his doubt , she came to kiss him , crying : I 'd do worse than lie tokeep you all mine and always mine , my dear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? ' So she won him to quick forgetfulness , and the days were bright . With Ruth they rode the beaches and the island trails , Mrs. Berent preferring a sunny corner by the pool . The bridle paths ran through groves of ancient live oaks hung with sweeping scarves of warm gray moss which might after a night of rain show14 Leave Her to Heavenpale green . Yellow jasmine spangled the forest with gold , and there were flowers everywhere , and they spent hours exploring the hidden ways . Harland , now that he began to know Ruth better , no longer thought of her as plain , though of course she was not beautiful as Ellen was beautiful . She rode , he found to his surprise , as well as Ellen did ; but while Ellen 's horse , when they returnees to the stable , was dark with sweat and flecked with foam , Ruth 's was always cool and unwearied . One night there was dancing at the dinner hour . When he took a turn with Ruth  --  she danced , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to know , Dick , that Mother and I are ever so glad about you and Ellen . ' I know , ' he agreed , thinking she meant that he need not be disturbed by Mrs. Berent 's habitual tone . Your mother 's bark is worse than her bite . ' She was doubtful at first , ' Ruth confessed . But she 's content now that she 's seen you together . ' I was doubtful myself at first , ' he admitted , with a chuckle . I was a bachelor and liked it . But now I know I was only halfalive . Ellen is sweet , really , ' she assured him . I do n't need to tell you that . But she 's strong , and till she learned to love you , she never  --  yielded to anyone . She 's nicer than ever now . ' There never was anyone like her , ' he agreed . You should see her with Danny . ' She loves him because you do , ' she assented . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Berent asked many questions about the youngster , and Ellen told her the routine of their days . I 'm with him all morning , ' she explained , while Richard works . Danny 's such a dear , lovable boy . Then Richard joins us for the afternoons , and sometimes we have lunch together , and sometimes if it 's fine we take long drives , the three of us . ' Mrs. Berent asked shrewdly : Does n't she ever let you and Danny have a minute alone , Mr. Harland ? ' Harland realized , with a disturbed surprise , that he had not in#act been alone with Danny since he and Ellen were married We like to be all together , ' he told her , evading a direct reply yet he wondered whether Danny did sometimes wish they might have an hour to themselves . Then he felt Ellen watching him andmet her eyes and smiled , ' We would n't have it any other way , ' he declared . You never will have it any other way , ' Mrs. Berent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never let you out of her sight again , ' They laughed at her together , but Harland , though he smiled with them , brushed his hand across his face with the gestureof a man who , walking through the forest at dawn , feels laidacross his cheeks the tiny , clinging strands which spiders during the night have spun. - In-Spring came drifting northward , flooding these southern lands with flowers , and on moonlit nights the mockingbirds were singe ing . Harland wrote to Leick to make all ready for them at Backof the Moon , and he told Ellen more and more about the spot so dear to him . But I 'm worried about how you 're going to like it , ' he ad , ! pitted . It 's rather primitive , you know . ' I 'll love it . I 'll always love any place that means so much to you . ' You 'll like Leick , ' he promised , and he told her something about the years when he and Leick from spring to fall had been inseparable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's knownyou so much longer than I. I shalt make him tell me all about you . ' Well , you 'll have chance enough . Up there , I get up at daylight , work till noon ; so you 'll have Leick to yourself all morning . Leick and Danny . ' She spoke slowly . Have you talked to Doctor Mason aboutDanny 's going , Richard ? I 'm not sure he would n't be better here , for a few months more . ' Leave Her to Heaven126 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 127Oh no ! He loves it there as I do . He 'll have all the swimming he wants , of course ; and you can help him with his exercises . ' What does Doctor Mason think ? ' I have n't asked him ! He laughed in forced confidence . If he does n't agree , we 'll tako Danny anyway ! ' She linked her arm in his . Do n't be too disappointed , Richard , if it seems best to leave Danny here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide his own fears he spoke curtly . There 's no question of leaving him here . If he ca n't go  --  why neither can we , that 's all . ' Then , realizing that his tone had been abrupt : But I 'm sure he 'll be able to go , Ellen . Do n't worry about it . ' Oh , I , ro n't , ' she promised . If Danny is better off here , you and I will stay , of course . Do n't consider me at all . Last summer here was really quite comfortable . I did n't mind it much . ' She was so patiently submissive that he exploded . Damn it , of course I 'll consider you ! But we have to consider Danny too ! ' Then when she did not speak he regretted his tone and said cheer- fully- You 'll find I 'm a different man at Bad : of the Moon . The trammels of civilization  --  whatever they are  --  tall away . I go pagan up there . ' Men arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to get off by themselves and pretend to be savages . But I 've some pagan in me , too , my dear . ' She drew his head down , kissed him with a tender ferocity : I wish there were going to be just the two of us , this first summer there . I 'd be as pagan as you choose ! ' A few days later  --  he postponed this as long as he could , dreading what the answer might be  --  Harland asked Doctor Mason 's opinion . Well , I 'm not sure , ' the other confessed . Mrs. Harland 's told me about the place . It seems pretty rugged for a boy on crutches . ' Harland resented this advantage she had taken , forestalling what he might say to the physician . She 's never been there , he pointed out . So she does n't know what it 's like . ' Tell me about it , ' the doctor suggested . Harland did so , explaining how easy it would be to make Dannycomfortable . Talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than either you or I what it will be like for him . ' Doctor Mason nodded . I will . ' He smiled . Probably Mrs. Harland sees it from the feminine point of view . ' Harland said : Well , she 's a woman ! ' She put it pretty strongly , ' the other remarked , his eyes veiled , his tone conveying an unspoken criticism . He added a saving word . But I 'm sure she 's only thinking what 's best for Danny . ' Why , naturally ! ' Harland assented , coloring ; and he spoke strongly . She 's devoted to him ! ' He wondered as he spoke why he felt it necessary to defend Ellen . Of course , ' Doctor Mason agreed . He rose , nodding in dismissal . Well , we do n't need to decide the question yet . I 'll talk to him . ' So in the end it was Danny himself who cast the deciding vote . When Harland heard the verdict , he was too jubilant to wonder whether Ellen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huston , who had served his mother and father and who since Mrs. Harland'sdeath was in fact mistress of the house on Chestnut Street , to expect them in mid-June ; and when they arrived there she greeted Danny with tearful affection , putting him at once to bed , tending him devotedly . To Ellen she gave a welcome so restrained that Ellen laughingly told Harland she felt like an intruder . She could n't disapprove of me any more obviously if I were a light-o ' - love you 'd picked up on the street somewhere , ' she declared . She 's jealous , ' he explained . She 's ruled the roost so long ! But if you want to win her , just get sick . She loves taking care of people . You see how she is with Danny . ' We might leave him here with her , ' she suggested , her tone light enough to make it clear that she was joking ; but she added : Even the trip north tired him . Maybe it would be wiser if we stayed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . He knows how much Back of the Moon means to me. ' t 2 8 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 129We might leave him in Bar Harbor , ' she proposed . With Mother and Ruth . He likes Ruth , and she 'd be happy taking care of him , and we could see him often . ' He said at a tangent , resenting her persistence : You 're always so ready to turn things over to Ruth ! As though she were a maid of all work , or something . ' She nodded indifferently . She 's adopted , you know , ' she explained . She was Father 's brother 's daughter , and he died . She 's lived with us since she was a baby , and of course Mother 's made a regular slave out of her . She could take care of Danny all right . ' He was astonished at this revelation , yet it seemed to make clear many things in Mrs. Berent 's attitude toward Ruth , and in Ellen 's , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation . I see , ' he commented . Well , we wo n't dump Danny on her hands , anyway ! He 's our job , Ellen . ' So she was silenced . On the way to Back of the Moon they stayed a night at Bar Harbor . After dinner , Ellen led Harland out of doors , and she showed him the wide gardens and the lawn sloping to the rocky shore , and the small study and workshop which Professor Berent had built many years ago on a knoll above the water . In the workroom , Harland watched her go to and fro , lifting things and putting them down again , seeming to find happinessin thus touching objects her father had touched . He saw a jar labelled Arsenic ' and felt , as normal persons will , a cold shiver of distaste . Why do n't you throw that away ? ' he suggested . Someone might get hold of it . ' No one ever comes here but me  --  and sometimes Ruth , to dust things , ' she assured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't swallow it . ' I 've always heard that even breathing the dust might kill you , ' he remembered . Did n't people get arsenic poisoning from wallpapers or something ? ' Fairy tales ! ' she said smilingly , and they turned out of doors again . The fine moon had risen and the night was warm , and theylay on the turf above the sea and watched the moon across the water , and the slow surf surging against the rocks below made the ground on which they lay faintly tremble . Harland was conscious of a deep intangible disturbance in him , an emotional anticipation like that which one may feel before the curtain rises at the opera , when the orchestra sets the key for the tragedy to follow . The night was fine , the moon was bright , Ellen was lovely and tender here beside him ; yet there was a vibration in the very earth itself , transmitted from the rocks on which the long swells beat , which seemed to warn him that this sweet and stable world was insecure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low tones mingling . Once Harland suggested that they go to say good night to Danny , but Ellen would not . Just forget everyone else but me for once , wo n't you ? ' she pleaded , and she said in a low tone : There 's never been a single day  --  except maybe just at the very first  --  not a single day , and hardly even a single hour since we were married when you 've thought of no one in the world but me . ' I do n't have to think of you , dearest ! You 're a part of me . The biggest and best part of me . ' He meant to reassure her , yet there was a profound intensity in her words which were inadequatelymet by his inanity . You do n't understand how much I love you , Richard , ' she said gravely . You 'll never understand how jealously I love you . I hate sharing your thoughts with anyone else at all . Even with Danny ! ' The hot passion in her tones was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been wonderful to him , ' he insisted , uneasily clinging to the commonplace . I know ! Oh , I know ! ' She drew closer to him till she lay pressed against his side , and he dropped his arm across her waist , turning toward her , tugging her closer . It 's ever so good of me , too ! ' she assured him lightly . Because I 'm so jealous of him I 'm ready to scratch his eyes out all the time ! ' He laughed as she was laughing , and he said honestly : I know , Ellen . You 're swell about it . I know it 's tough for you , but  --  . 13 0 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 131he has no one but us . He 's shut off from all his old friends . We 've got to be his whole world for a while . ' She asked after a moment , in a small voice , her face buried in his shoulder : Will you send him away to school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . He 'll want to go on to college with the boys he 's always known . ' Boarding school ? ' He 's always gone to day school . He 'll probably live at home , at least till he goes to college . ' I 'll be good to him , Richard , ' she promised , turning for his kiss . As good as I know how . ' He held her close and gratefully , and the moon was silver on the sea. - IvAtbreakfast Mrs. Berent was in an unaccountably malicious humor . She told them that Russ Quinton had called upon her a few days before to ask for news of Ellen . He was elected prosecuting attorney , last fall , ' she said . He 's very proud of himself ! ' I ca n't imagine Russ in politics , ' Ellen declared . With his temper he makes so many enemies . ' Probably he thinks he can work off his bad temper by sending people to jail , ' Mrs. Berent suggested , and she added : He has n't forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but if you 're wise you 'll never give him a chance to get even . ' I 'm not planning to murder anyone , Mother , ' Ellen said evenly . If that 's what you mean . ' Harland chuckled . This sounds like a meeting of hardened criminals , discussing their enemy , the law , ' he protested , and turned the talk to other things . After breakfast they set out for Back of the Moon . They took the familiar road through the forest to Cherryfield , and turned north then for ten or twelve miles  --  the way was rough and rutted , and Richard drove slowly , easing the car over every irregularity  --  and so came to Joe Severin 's farm , where the wood road to the camp began and where Leick was waiting . On the way , Harland at the wheel listened smilingly to Danny 's eager and excited voice as the youngster pointed out to Ellen familiar sights and scenes ; and again and again Danny appealed to him for confirmation of some statement he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that so , Dick ? ' or : We did , Dick , did n't we ? ' Harland always agreed , till Ellen said gaily : You 're in a conspiracy , you two ; just a team of great big liars backing each other up ! I do n't know which of you is worse . ' And she told Harland : ' You 're as bad as he is , Richard . You act about two years old . ' I warned you , ' he reminded her . I 'm a different man up here . ' I do n't want you to be a different man , ' she assured him . ' You suit me very well as you are . ' They turned into Joe Severin 's farmyard  --  Harland always parked his car in Joe 's shed when he went in to camp  --  and Leick and Joe himself and Joe 's two sons , brawny young men who had near-by farms and families of their own , were waiting to meet them . Joe was a little Frenchman with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a man . He was not much more than five feet tall , but his shoulders were tremendouslywide and he had a merry mouth and twinkling eyes . His wife , beaming on them from the kitchen doorway , was as tall as her sons , with the flaxen hair and the clear complexion of her Scandinavian blood . Harland looked first to Leick , for it was almost two years since they had met ; but his first greeting was for Joe and the two tall sons , before  --  keeping the best for the last  --  he turned to Leick and their hands clasped in the silent pressure of long understanding . Danny , shouting with glee , not waiting for help , launched himself out of the car and took his crutches , and Joe turned to touch him  --  softly as a woman  --  on the shoulder and to say how he had grown in these two years , and Leick went to Danny too ; and then Harland saw Ellen still in the car , holding herself aloof , watching his proud delight at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a frown ; and he called Joe and Leick to meet her , and chuckled inwardly at the quick appreciation of13 2 Leave Her to Heavenher beauty in Joe 's eyes . With Ellen and Danny and Leick , the three people dearest in the world to him , now at last brought together , he was a happy man . He left them by the car and went to give Mrs. Severin a hug and a smacking kiss , and she insisted that they stop long enough for a bite  --  a cup of coffee , oatmeal , a hot doughnut  --  while Joe and Leick hitched the horses to the buckboard . So Harland led Ellen proudly indoors , and Danny was nimble on his crutches , his cheeks bright , his eyes dancing with happiness . For a while they stayed in the immaculate and sunny kitchen , and Harland saw regretfully that with Ellen Mrs. Severin was not at ease ; that Ellen too was restrained . He left them together , hoping Ellen would know how to win the other woman , returning presentlywith a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come along , m'lord ! Your carriage waits ! ' As Danny came out , Joe 's sons brought from the barn a comfortablearmchair on each side of which two iron rings had been bolted to hold spruce carrying poles ; and Danny , when he saw it , shouted with delight . Oh , that 's swell , Dick ! ' he cried . But his eyes filled even while he smiled , and Harland knew that this more than anything that had gone before had brought home to Danny his own helplessness . Try it for size , ' he directed , and Danny took his seat and declaredthe chair was perfect , and Leick met Harland 's eyes and wiped his mouth with his hand and Harland knew that Leick too understood Danny 's sudden shocking realization of his disability ; and he remembered how in the past Danny had taken the trail from here to Back of the Moon at a jog trot , tirelessly pacing off the miles , and he swallowed hard . To cheer Danny and himself he hurried their departure . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the road became too rough . You can ride or walk as you prefer , ' he told Ellen . She elected at first to ride with him , and they set out , the four men carrying Danny in the chair and making the pace . Harland , once they were under way , forgot his sadness of the moment that was past ; yet he felt restraint in Ellen still . Does it scare you ? ' he asked gently . It 's fine when we get there . ' Leave Her to Heaven 133I do n't think I 'd quite realized how hard it will be for Danny , ' she said . There 'll be so many things we 'll do together which he ca n't do . ' We 'll just do things we can all do , ' he assured her . I 've sent up an outboard motor and one of those light speedboats for him to run around the lake in . I have n't told him yet . It 's a surprise . And he can paddle a canoe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , so he can share them . ' She looked at him briefly . I suppose we can order our lives to his , ' she agreed , and added : It 's as though we were all three  --  crippled , is n't it ? Because he goes on crutches , so must we . ' He felt the bitterness in her tones and spoke in quiet warning : We 'll have to be careful not to let him think he 's cramping our style . ' And of course , ' she suggested hopefully , if we wanted to take a trip  --  go to New Brunswick after salmon , for instance  --  we could leave him with Leick and he 'd be all right . ' He hesitated , said slowly : I 'm afraid I 'll never go fishing withoutLeick . He 's a habit with me . ' He and Danny both ! ' she commented in a dry tone . And now you , ' he reminded her , refusing to hear the rancor in her voice . Three mighty happy habits , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after five or six miles , at the spring where the wood road ended , and went on afoot . The trail followed the stream 's cascading course upward toward the pond from which it flowed , and Harland pointed out places where Leick had widened or improved the path , to make it easier for the chair to pass . And he 's done the same thing at camp , ' he explained . Put in some zigzags , eased the steep pitches , so Danny can get from the cabin down to the boathouse on his crutches . Maybe not just at first , but when he 's stronger . ' I can help him , of course , ' she agreed , in a flat submission ; but he was too happy to heed . From the top of the first ridge he pointed out to her the roof of the cabin on the flank of the lofty hill ahead and still a fair mile away . I 3 4 Leave Her to HeavenYou can just make out the break in the trees where the sunny ledges . are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . And there 's a high rocky shoulder on the northeast face of the hill , not far above the cabin , where you can see all over the pond , see for miles . ' They were well ahead of the others when they reached the foot of the pond and the boathouse beside the dam , built of logs and two stories high . I 've a study upstairs there where I work , ' Harland explained . But we wo n't stop to inspect that now . ' The cabin was a hundred yards , and a hundred feet of altitude , above the water ; a long , low structure to which  --  the freshly peeled spruce logs were evidence of this  --  a new wing had been added . The central living room ran from front to back , and the kitchen and storeroom were on the northeast side . Their bedroom and Danny 's were side by side in the new wing , with a screened porch for sleeping in the open air when the weather made it more pleasant to do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show Ellen the little there was to see . I had Lcick build this new wing , ' he explained . Danny and I had just the one bedroom , of course . ' He looked at her hopefully . Like it ? ' It 's very nice , ' she assented in a flat voice . The wall between their room and Danny 's was a single thickness of smoothed boards . If Danny wakes in the night and needs us , we can hear the slightest sound . ' He understood what she did not say . It 's pretty close quarters , of course , ' he admitted apologetically . We wo n't have much privacy . But we 'll be out of doors most of the time when the weather 's fine . ' Where does Leick sleep ? ' she asked , like one making polite conversation . Off the kitchen , where we can hear him too ? ' He tried to laugh her out of this humor . Now , now ! ' He put his arm around her ; but she freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No , he has a room down in the boathouse . ' Here they come , ' she remarked . He heard the voices of the men outside . I 'll put Danny right to bed . ' Harland followed her out to meet the others , watching her withLeave Her to Heaven 3 5unhappy eyes . He had looked forward to their arrival here with the eagerness of a boy , anticipating Danny 's delight , tasting beforehandthe happiness of showing Ellen this spot which meant so much to him ; but now her disappointment was so plain . She and Leick helped Danny from his chair ; and despite his insistence that he was not tired , they led him indoors . Harland stayed to thank Joe Severin and his sons for their help ; and Joe must have read his troubled thoughts , for the little man said reassuringly : Let her get settled and used to it here and she 'll like it fine . ' Harland was astonishingly grateful . Joe and his sons departed , and Leick presently came out and said , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit her , she 'll feel different . ' Both Joe and Leick had read her well , but Harland had learned long ago not to be surprised at the understanding hearts of simple men.  --  vDuringthe first days , Harland saw how skillfully Leick woke in Ellen the homemaking instinct which lies dormant in every woman . That first afternoon , the woodsman went to her with a question . I did n't put up any pegs in your bedroom , ma'am , because I did n't know just where you 'd want them . What would you think of here behind the door ? ' So she consulted with him , and when that problem was solved he proposed another , till she began to have ideas of her own , Leick , who with an axe , a draw shave , a ship auger , and a few nails could work miracles , placed shelves and pegs where she wished them to be , built a rustic table and some chairs , delighted her with his capacities . Harland let Leick work his magic upon her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed insoluble ; and he never made any comment to Ellen , suspecting that to do so might make her recognize her own surrender and fight against it . But more than once he spoke of her to Leick. 13 6 Leave Her to Heaven Leave Her to Heaven 137She 's happy here now all right , ' he said , at the end of the first week , triumphantly . She is so , ' Leick assented . Making over the place to suit makes it seem like her own . That 's the way you get to like a place , or a man ; doing things for them . We 'll want to keep her busy . ' She 's wonderful , is n't she ? ' Harland 's pride needed sharing . Leick 's eyes twinkled . She thinks you 're hung to the moon . ' Harland said soberly : I know it . I 've got a full-time job , living up to what she thinks of me . ' It would suit her a lot better if there was just the two of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any picnic for a pretty woman , hid away up here with two men and a lame boy , and no outsidegood times at all . ' Harland acknowledged that this was true ; but he had no long misgivings , for their days soon settled into a pleasant routine . They rose at dawn , waked usually by the sounds Leick made in the kitchen ; and Harland and Ellen raced down to the boathouse for an early dip in the cove , where morning mists might be curling up from the shallow water which in the cool dawnings seemed so much wanner than the air . By the time they returned , Leick would have helped Danny dress ; and they breakfasted together , sometimes indoors , sometimes on the screened veranda which caught the early sun . Harland spent the mornings at his desk in the study above the boathouse ; and Danny conscientiously made his way down to the wharf , using the easy grades of the new path , and grew stronger all the time . Usually he and Ellen in the late forenoon swam in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buoyant water , his disabilities were no longer so obvious . If the day were fine , he swam again in the afternoon , Ellen and Harland with him . Sometimes they took canoe or rowboat  --  Harland had here two canoes and a flat-bottomed skiff which Leick had built to bring firewood from along the shore , as well as the frail speedboat to which the powerful outboard could be attached  --  and went exploring the lake . At its farther end , as distantas possible from the boathouse , there was a sandy beach sosmooth and level that a hundred yards from shore the water was still no more than shoulder-deep , and they often chose to go there . Harland was a strong though not a skillful swimmer ; but Ellen swam as easily and as beautifully as a seal , slim and graceful and completely at home in the water ; and Harland and Danny watched her with an equal delight . Sometimes they spent an afternoon sprawled together on a broad ledge beyond the cabin , talking little or not at all , baking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Harland and Danny were soon brown as leather from head to heel , while Ellen'sshoulders and legs and back acquired a warm and tawny hue which Harland thought delicious . At dusk they were always sleepy , and as often as not the late sunsets saw them already abed . Harland was completely happy . Ellen seemed to him more beautiful than ever , and to touch her hand , to hear her voice , to meet her eyes could make his throat fill and his cheeks burn . She wore a sleepy , sultry indolence , smiling at him through half , closed eyes ; and whenever he touched her she was warm as a sunned cat , and his days were rich with joy in her . Also , his work went well , and he was filled with a sense of good achievement . Often , after their noonday meal , he read to them what he had written . Danny had always approved what Harland wrote with an uncritical pride . Ellen was less interested , and she listened lazily , watching Harland with hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript and met her glance his pulses quickened leapingly . Once , when this happened , he said in laughing accusation : You 're not listening ! ' I 'd lots rather watch you than listen to stories about other people , ' she told him in teasing flattery . Did you know your ears wiggle when you read ? ' Rarely she had comments , but they were always personalized , as though everything he wrote were directed at her . Thus once she said , drawling sleepily : You 're one of those men who think women 's place is in thea 3 8 Leave Her to Heaven . Leave Her to Heaven ' 39home , are n't you ? Just good plain cooks ? Is that what you want me to be , Richard ? ' He laughed , uneasy under her smiling mockery . Well , somethingbesides just a cook ! ' he admitted . She touched his hand . You 're such a boy ! See him blushing , Danny ! Mothers too ? When I have a baby , will you be happy ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read on . He made one of his characters remark that a man needed contact with his fellows to toughen his fibre , and she said laughingly : You 're a fine one to preach that , when you hide yourself away here all summer long , see nobody at all . ' Oh , a writer 's different , ' he argued . He needs to get away by himself , to see things in perspective . ' But must n't he mingle with crowds to learn to know people ? . ' I do n't like crowds . ' He chuckled . People in crowds seem to me like perambulating eggs . I want to crack a shell here and there and sample the meat inside . ' ' You ca n't go around cracking human eggs , of course , ' she warned him . So often you find them soft-boiled . They 'd spill all over you . ' They had many such drowsy afternoons , talking slow talk together , so absorbed in each other that they sometimes forgot Danny was listening . if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertion , they slipped away like truants , wandering through the forest or drifting quietly along shore in a canoe . They liked to go without him to that beach at the pond 's farther end , and Ellen , as she had warned Harland long ago , could be as pagan as he , so that sometimes as they sported in the clear , warms shallow water , their laughter rang through the still hot afternoons till Leick , busy about his small tasks at the camp far away , might hear . From these adventures they came demurely home , sleek and serene . But there were other hours when it seemed to Harland that a cloud shadow passed ominously across their world , and there were hours when he seemed to hear warning thunder far away . Once when he had been reading aloud to them she said drily : Your hero does n't think much of women , does he ? ' He has n't met the right one yet . ' He 'd better do it soon , if you expect women to read your book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what they tell men , but actually they 're a lot more interested in other women . ' She smiled . Poor darling , you do n't know much about women , do you ? ' I 'm learning , ' he assured her . You teach me new things every day . ' She looked at him thoughtfully . You 've a lot to learn , ' she said . He tried to laugh . Oh , I do n't find women so mysterious ! ' You do n't know enough about its  --  even about me  --  to know how little you know , ' she told him , and there was no smile in her voice nor in her eyes . Harland , uneasy without reason , looked at Danny and saw the youngster watching her with a grave attention , as though trying to appraise her tone. - vIThepond was crescent-shaped , curving around the base of the hill on the flank of which the cabin was set . The ground rose steeply for the first two hundred feet above the water , then ascendedmore gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the hill a narrow point of land , no more than two or three rods wide , littered with great boulders and grown thick with young spruces , extended half across the pond . Late in July , Danny swam from the cove inside that narrow point of land to the opposite shore . Ellen accompanied him in the flat-bottomedskiff , and they told Harland in advance nothing of their plans . They left the wharf one still warm morning two hours after breakfast , and Harland , at his desk in the room above the boathouse , heard them row away ; but he was absorbed in his work and did not speak to them , and their voices were hushed so as not to disturb him . He paid no particular attention till , his day 's stint done , he realized that they had not returned ; and n , took the speedboat and went roaring off to find them.
