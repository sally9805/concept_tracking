" We were about to perish for lack of air , " said Finance Minister Rene Mayer last week . " We had to smash the window with a single blow . " Mayer chiefly meant that , without devaluation of the franc ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) , French recovery would have been stifled through inability to sell goods abroad . But for a few days last week , Rene Mayer and Premier Robert Schuman had French Socialists at their throats . As advocates of dirigisme ( directed economy ) , Socialists did not like the breeze of free enterprise that threatened to blow through the smashed window . <P> From Buried Pots ? For Socialists it was almost a crisis of conscience . Commented the independent Combat : " France takes the initiative in seeking recovery on the principle of a system that everyone thought was finished . " <P> The Socialists blasted the proposed law to set up a free market in gold . To Premier Schuman and Finance Minister Mayer , the free gold market was the lodestone that would draw hoarded gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This in turn would stimulate production and provide a stabilizing base for currency and foreign trade . To the Socialists , the 25% fine to be levied against hoarders was inadequate punishment for unpatriotic speculators . <P> After an all-night session of the Assembly , Ren Mayer partly appeased the Socialists . He proposed , as a blow at black marketeers , to withdraw all 5,000-franc notes from circulation . The balky Socialists swung into line . The Assembly adjourned at 5:45 a.m . <P> The Bitter Pill . Less than ten hours later , the weary legislators returned to vote on the gold proposal . Premier Schuman staked his government 's survival on the measure , gave the Socialists a clear choice . With the Communists and the Gaullists eagerly waiting for the coalition government to prove its incompetence to rule , the Socialists decided to stick with Schuman . Schuman 's margin : a comfortable 98 votes . <P> Meanwhile , Ren Mayer 's economic window-smashing had bewildered and frightened Frenchmen . Prices of oranges , chickens , beans , eggs skittered nervously upward . Many a thrifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days before he learned that the government would redeem his notes in full-if he could prove that he came by them legally . Said a Paris policeman : " This is a bitter pill , but we will have to swallow it . Let 's hope it will save France . "
