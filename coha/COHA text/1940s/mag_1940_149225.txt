In the greatest peacetime Army expansion in U. S. history , the General Staff is as busy as beavers in a springtime flood . To lighten the work of Deputy Chief of Staff William Bryden , Chief of Staff General George Catlett Marshall fortnight ago appointed a second deputy : scholarly , friendly Brigadier General Richard Curtis Moore of the Engineers . Last week General Marshall appointed another Engineer officer to take Dick Moore 's place as head of the G-4 ( supply ) section of the General Staff . Chosen to run the section which oversees most of the household details of Army life , from buying soldiers ' underwear to building barracks , was tall , golfing Colonel Eugene Reybold , after 13 years spent doing rivers and harbors work for the Army . <P> True to a custom in Washington ( a supposed sop to pacifistic civilian taxpayers ) , Gene Reybold sat down at his desk in shirt sleeves and mufti , a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles camouflaging his military nose . Like most Army men out of uniform , he managed to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is.
