Britain 's new commander in the Middle East ( see above ) , General Sir Harold Rupert Leofric George Alexander , once had a conversation with a literary friend . The author stared at the soldier , and said : " Tell me something I have always wanted to know , Alex . You 're really very intelligent , are n't you ? " <P> Alexander winked . <P> " I am , " he said . <P> The British last week put their hopes in General Alexander 's intelligence and in his reputation as an aggressive fighting man . He gained the reputation in World War I , when he went over the top 30 times , was wounded twice , was twice decorated ( D.S.O. , M.C. ) In the British Army his known talent for aggression still outweighs his World War II record as the leader of two " brilliant retreats , " from Dunkirk and Burma . Now in Egypt , he commands forces which can not retreat again without losing all that they defend . At El Alamein his back is to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wavell , Cunningham , Auchinleck-failed to beat Rommel . <P> Alexander succeeds Auchinleck in the over-all command of the Middle East . Under him , in direct command of the Eighth Army in Egypt , he has Lieut . General Bernard Law Montgomery , a 54-year-old Ulsterman who is also a veteran of the retreat from France . But , like Wavell and Auchinleck ( who at the last held both the area and army commands ) , Alexander is responsible for victory or defeat . <P> At 50 , Alexander is the youngest full general in the British Army . He is also a favorite subject of army stories . At Dunkirk he showed some of the qualities of the U.S. Army 's General Douglas MacArthur . When the remnants of the B.E.F . seemed to face destruction , Alexander donned his smartest breeches and finest boots , sat down to breakfast in a shell-shattered house , at a table with a spotless cloth , and calmly consumed Dundee marmalade. * <P> On the bloody beaches a staff officer told Alexander : " The situation is catastrophic . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand such big words . " He then squatted on the beach and built a sand castle . He was the last man in his command to leave Dunkirk . <P> <P> * In World War I a Scottish regiment charged into a hopeless action with the cry : " Marmalade forever ! "
