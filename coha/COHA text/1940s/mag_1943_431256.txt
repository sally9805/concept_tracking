 | Wake Up to the Farmer 's Plight ! , /h Condensed from The American Mercury Webb Waldron IT TAKES much longer to train a boy to be any good on a farm than to train him to work in a war plant , " said Charley Graves , Indiana farmer . " Fellows leave the farm in droves and in a few weeks learn to operate a machine and make big money . But it takes a year or more to train a boy to do farm work . Some ca n't learn at all . Farming takes more special skills and more judgment than any other job in the world . " " Just consider hog raising , " said an Illinois farmer , Kenneth Moore , who last year produced 125 tons of pork ? a year 's ration of 2 I a pounds a week for 190o people . " Every stage demands continuous care and knowhow . You 've got to put sunshades over your sows one minute , get ' em in out of a blizzard the next . Too much heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 'll have them sick or dead . When a sow is about to farrow you 've got to watch her constantly . Often we sit up all night with her , or we 'll lose some of her pigs . " Wencker Meyer , a young Missouri farmer , told me about a man he had put in charge of feeding hogs , after giving him full instructions , while he himself was busy contourplowing his uplands . One day the man said : " Them hogs been acting queer . " Cholera had attacked his herd . " If I had been feeding them , " said Meyer , " I 'd have recognized the first symptoms and might have saved most of the hogs . " But he lost them all . " On a farm , " said Meyer , " there are things everywhere you ca n't tell a man . He has to know them out of experience . " With cattle , even with chickens , the same meticulous care is necessary . " You 've got to watch your help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk the cows dry . If milk is left in the bag by a careless milker , the cow 's output drops steadily . First thing you know , she 'll be dry ? long before she should be . " " Protein foods produce milk , " an Illinois dairyman said , " but push a cow too hard with heavy proteins and you cut short her productive life . It practically comes down to an individual judgment with every cow . " Farm machines and parts are almost unobtainable . So the farmer  | hesitates to entrust his equipment to inexperienced hands . A Kansas farmer put a high school boy on his tractor . The boy backed it into a gang plow and ruined two tires , putting the tractor out of commission when the farmer needed it most . " Plowing is n't a thing you can tell a man how to do , " said one Indiana farmer . " It 's an art . Expert plowing and cultivating is half the success of the crop ? means the difference between profit and loss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east and west about their present labor crisis . It makes clear why the advice " get some high school boys or city folks to help out " does n't appeal . The general verdict is that such persons are valuable for seasonal work such as haying , potato digging , apple picking , but they are not worth bothering with for general farm operations . Thousands of farmers for lack of proper help are auctioning their stock and machinery , and quitting . An Indiana farmer 's comment is typical : " My son was drafted , and now my daughter and I have to do all the work . I do n't believe we 'll be able to keep it up . I 'll have to sell the cows . " When the farmer himself is drafted ? and that often happens then the farm almost necessarily has to close down . For every farm , almost every field , has a personality of its own . It responds most generously to a certain rotation of crops , to certain fertilizers matters known only to the man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different with each farm . The U. S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 360o Kansas farms will be idle in 1943 four times as many as this year . In one issue of a small Kansas newspaper I counted notices of five dispersal sales of farm stock and machinery . " I ca n't get help " . . . " Leaving to join the army " . . . " My son has been drafted " ? these were reasons given . " There have been 27 farm sale notices tacked up in this town this fall , " reported a Wisconsin farmer , " and there will be a lot more next spring . " So the tale runs all across the farmlands . Last autumn there were 35 percent more dairy cattle slaughtered on the Milwaukee market than the year before . Significant , for Wisconsin is pre-eminently a dairy state . The slaughtering is widespread . If you wonder why , in our land of plenty , there 's to be rationing of dairy products , that is one reason . Few farmers I talked with thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting enough , maybe too much in certain cases . Prices would have to take a prohibitive jump for the farmer to compete for labor on even terms with the war industries . But I wonder whether the man who quits a farm job for a war plant is always better off . In Henry County , Illinois , I learned of a married farmhand who , in addition to $90 a month , got a house , a garden , two gallons of milk a day , three  | pigs , feed for his chickens , and fuel . He quit to go to work in a munitions plant . His wife and children cried when they left the farm . Farmers have been bitter against draft boards that refused to exempt farm labor . A common complaint is that the boards seldom have dirt farmers on them . " Our draft board is made up of lawyers and politicians , " said a Missouri farmer . I heard this comment again and again . Recently in Illinois a board inducted a young unmarried farmer who was operating head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beef , 70,000 pounds of pork , 70,000 pounds of whole milk . The farmer 's father , the owner , is 69 and unable to work . The board said : " Your dad is well fixed . Ile can take care of himself . We need soldiers . " This is not a farm problem , it is a food problem . The need for food for our armed forces , our civilian population and our allies will be greater next year than this . Yet , as Secretary Wickard has said , the shortage of farm labor threatens to decrease food production in 1943 . The situation is critical and may become catastrophic , if we are to continue to supply food to England . Farm boys hesitate to seek exemption . A Nebraska youngster who sought deferment because he was the sole effective worker on the farm , and help was unobtainable , found his car painted yellow one morning . In Missouri I talked with a boy of 21 who has been his father 's chief helper on a r3oo-acre livestock farm . Faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably make a good fighter , but would n't he be of more value on the farm ? " He 's worth any other two men , " said his father , " and I ca n't find the two . " Even automatic deferment for farm labor in Selective Service legislation will not solve the problem . Farm boys will still leave for war plants , or to enlist . We need to realize ? and to convince them ? that the man on the farm is performing as essential and patriotic a service as the man in the factory , the merchant marine or the armed forces .
