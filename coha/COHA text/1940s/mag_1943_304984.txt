Through Pittsburgh streets a procession of three flivvers , bearing five U.S. Senators and a Representative , tooled showily one day last week . The fuel that drove their cars gurgled into carburetors from glass jars exposed to public view . And the passengers had the air of men participating in an epoch-making event . Reason : the gasoline in the jars had been made from coal . <P> The Congressmen were members of a joint committee on war minerals , looking into a possible solution of the impending U.S. petroleum shortage . The show was staged by Dr. R. R. Sayers , director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines . But despite all the foofaraw , the Congressmen 's ride was less epoch-making than it seemed . The plain scientific fact is that at the 1941 rate of consumption the U.S. is not likely to need coal for gasoline for at least 200 years . Reasons : <P> &gt; The best U.S. coal for making oil now known ( Birmingham , Ala. bituminous ) yields 134 gallons of gas to the ton of coal . But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still costs about 15 a gallon to produce , three times the cost of gasoline from petroleum . <P> &gt; The Western hemisphere still has vast reserves in four gasoline sources cheaper than coal . In order of cost : 1 ) petroleum ( some four billion tons of known reserves ) , 2 ) natural gas , 3 ) tar sands , 4 ) oil shales . All this adds up to 60 billion tons of oil ; even if no new petroleum or natural gas reserves are found ( unlikely ) , there would still be 40 billion tons left by the year 2,000 . <P> &gt; The Germans found out in 1914 how to manufacture gasoline by treating coal dust with hydrogen under heat and pressure arid have been forced to use it ever since , but they have never licked the high-cost problem . Says an American oil industry expert : " If the master technicians of the world the Germans were unable to work out a competitive product by this coal hydrogenation process after almost 30 years of effort , if the British failed to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is highly unlikely that the U.S. will find the answer .
