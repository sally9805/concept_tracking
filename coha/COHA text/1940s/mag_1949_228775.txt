U.S. doctors learned last week how much it costs to wage all-out propaganda war against President Truman 's national health insurance program : in eight months , the American Medical Association 's press-agents had spent a whopping $1,394,000 . But to the 3,942 A.M.A. members gathered in Washington , no price seemed too high to fight off the threat of socialized medicine . So the A.M.A. voted , for the first time in its ' 102-year history , to levy dues ( $25 a year ) on its members. * <P> While most of the doctors attended technical meetings or watched color-televised operations , the 191-member house of delegates met at a long , green-topped table in the Hotel Statler . A.M.A. President Ernest Irons made no bones about it : the meetings were being held in Washington to make sure that the doctors ' drumfire was heard by their enemies in government offices . <P> President-elect Elmer Henderson sounded the war cry : " Let 's face our battle of Armageddon . . . No other profession , in . . . this country , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over it . . . " <P> Imported Virus . Sitting at the back of the room as Henderson spoke were platinum-haired Clem Whitaker and his copper-haired business partner-wife , Leone Baxter , who were hired last February at $100,000 a year to give the medical profession 's account of itself to the U.S. public . Whitaker &; Baxter reported on what they had done since " the virus of socialized medicine had spread from decadent Europe and taken deep root here . " <P> Examples : " More than 55 million pieces of campaign literature were . . . distributed , carrying medicine 's answer to the federal plan . . . Over 65,000 posters of The Doctor* went up in medical offices and elsewhere to dramatize the case against political medicine . " <P> Said Whitaker &; Baxter : " The first skirmishes were ended and won . Unfortunately , the war was not . " These first skirmishes had been paid for out of $2,250,000 raised from voluntary $25 assessments , which 75% of the A.M.A. 's active , assessable members had paid . The money was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the A.M.A. 's top brass expects in 1950 , conscript dollars were needed . The house of delegates ruled that any doctor who falls 13 months behind in dues would forfeit membership . <P> Gloomy Prognosis . At once , worried A.M.A. members asked whether a doctor who defaulted on A.M.A. dues would have to be dropped from his county or state medical society . If he were , he could not get staff appointments at most hospitals nor get his patients into their beds . Dr. Louis Bauer , chairman of the board of trustees , said that this need not happen . <P> But rebels in the A.M.A. 's own ranks were not reassured . New York Clinician Ernst P. Boas loosed a blast for the Physicians ' Forum , which favors the Fair Deal 's national health plan . The dues levy , said he , " is against the interests of a majority of Americans , who need a national prepayment system of medical care ... It will convert the professional organization of America 's physicians into a political lobby . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
