With Allied forces holding a firm footing on Luzon , Japanese strategists , meeting in Tokyo last week , had to make up their minds on many vital questions . Should they try to hold any part of their southern conquests ? Should they continue to reinforce Luzon , to drag out the delaying action , and thus buy time ? Should they dispose their forces for an archipelagic war or for a continental war ? <P> There was evidence that the top Japanese command was bent upon prolonging the war at any cost . Their dispositions on Luzon fitted such an intention : of an estimated nine divisions on the island , three were reported in the extreme south , three in the extreme north , and the balance in central reserve near Manila . This was a disposition designed to permit maximum resistance wherever General MacArthur might land-and obviously with no plan of evacuation in mind . <P> Far to the west , in Burma , five Japanese divisions had been destroyed , but five remained . They were all but cut off , and likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of Southeast Asia were at least five more Jap divisions , plus brigades of garrison troops . The enemy was not ready to abandon Southeast Asia . In China he was busy tearing up spur lines to get ties and rails for completing the overland route to Indo-China . The only purpose of this line , if it is ever opened , would be to drag out resistance in the vast peninsula .
