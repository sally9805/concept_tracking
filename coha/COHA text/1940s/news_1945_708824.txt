txt To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Some students of recent history are maintaining that the actions of the United States after the last war made possible the present one . They also point out that from present indications we bid fair to repeat pur performance after Versailles and by so doing we will be a potent force in causing the next war . Their reasoning is not without considerable merit . They trace the causal chain culminating in the Second World War from our failure to collect our war debts from our European allies . By this means , as a pump primer for World War II , we allowed not only our allies to retain billions belonging to us but they , in turn , permitted Germany to retain billions due them . This , of course , was a boon to economic conditions throughout Europe and offered an arrangement that must have been pleasing to business men in all European countries . This money which we loaned , one might say , was used for foodstuffs and the rehabilitation of civilian populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe had disarmed ; but it did not , and the billions we allowed to remain there could just as easily be followed into new armaments as they could be into foodstuffs and clothing . Loans for What Purpose ? On top of this , the toothsome bonuses offered by Germany and other countries induced American bankers , who dealt in such things , to pour untold billions into Europe after the war in exchange for worthless paper . These billions undoubtedly went into building up armaments for the second war because , quite obviously , they released other money which necessarily had to be used for civilians . Today we are doing the same thing on a larger scale , and the question is are we again flooding Europe with gold so that she will have excess moneys to devote to armaments ? Mr. Stalin has just announced to the Soviets that Russia would shortly be proud of the vast navy that will be hers . He also assures the Soviets that Russia will continue to have a powerful army . In almost the same breath , he asks us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , give him if our spending spree lasts a few months longer . It is a matter of simple mathematics to conclude that we will provide for Mr. Stalin six billion dollars ' worth of preparedness for the next war . This also poses the question : for what purpose does Stalin seek this great fleet ? Does he need it against Germany ? That would be a silly thought . Italy ? Surely Italy would not be a naval threat to anybody , and who would dare say that when we are through with Japan she will have anything more than a few trawlers ? Big Armaments a Luxury We can only , therefore , conclude that Russia needs her fleet to protect herself against England and the United States . Of course , she has a right to this fleet the same as England and we intend to keep up our sea forces , but can anybody point out a good reason why we should pay for Russia 's fleet through the medium of a tremendous loan ' ? And further , to be fair about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give another dollar to England or France , since whatever we give to these countries will only serve to release so many more billions for the upkeep of armaments which they propose ? Vast armaments in any country are a luxury . None of us would dispense our largesse to a needy person who we knew was going to luxuriate in a new automobile . Needy Europe , clamoring for our gold , comes right out and tells us that she is going to use it for streamlined cruisers , 1946 model tanks , and the last word in accessories . Surely this is startling behavior for a borrower . Perhaps these Americans who are shocked , and who , of course , would be smeared as Fascists by our self-styled liberals , may have the right idea .

Gasoline Allotments Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Timm : Last night I counted in Northport Harbor fifty-two motor-boats setting out for a sunset sail . The owners could scarcely argue that they were going fishing and thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audible comments of small home owners and visitors who sat on the pier benches was a revelation of a growing sense of injustice and of mounting indignation at this lavish wasting of our scanty gasoline supply for the pleasure of so few . " And we could n't get gas to go up to the farm to repair our barn , " said a neighbor in a tone that implied bitter grievance . Is n't the OPA opening itself to angry criticism when by its distribution program it fails to give justice to all in its allotment of gasoline to luxury pleasure craft . ROSE MUTTON , Huntington , L. I. , July 30 , 1945 . Justice Shallow Not a Portrait TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your issue of July 29 it was stated : " But what is held to be beyond dispute is that the Sir Thomas Lucy who owned Charlecote was as Justice Shallow caricatured by the Bard in ' The Merry Wives of Windsor . ' " Now , there are relatively few facts which are beyond dispute in the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the identification of Justice Shallow and Sir Thomas Lucy . It is not necessary to enter into all the details of the case here , but it is worth pointing out that many Shakespeare scholars of repute hardly regard it as settled . Concerning this tradition , which appeared in the late seventeenth century in a manuscript note by Richard Davies , and was taken up by Rowe in his biography of the poet , a leading authority on the life of Shakespeare , Sir Edmund Chambers , concludes : " ' F " It would not be a justifiable inference that the presentment of Justice Shallow as a whole * * is in any way meant to be a ' portrait ' of the worthy justice . " WILLIAM ELTON . Columbus , Ohio , July 30 , 1945 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Announcement that the War Production Board is starting to release to the public the insecticide DDT makes appropriate some comments on the use of this war-developed chemical , which will prove to be of great value in many applications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of barns it will kill flies which alight thereon ; applied to household screens it will reduce the nuisance from flies and mosquitos ; its use to exterminate roaches , ants and other household pests seems feasible . The toxic qualities of the drug persist for an extended period following application . However , the chemical is extremely powerful , and like electricity , TNT , fire , etc. , can be useful when controlled but disastrous if misused . Suppose , for example , that a farmer sprays an extended area to eliminate an infestation of caterpillars . Destroyed , also , will be the butterflies , bees , flies and other insects which carry the pollen from one plant to another , fertilizing them . Gone , too , will be his neighbor 's income from hives of honeybees . The bird population , largely dependent on insects for food , must starve or depart to untreated areas which , already carrying maximum population , can not meet the nesting requirements of the incomers . Or , perhaps , a marsh is sprayed to eliminate mosquitos . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insectivorous birds . Then , what of the young fish which feed on insects and their eggs and larvae ? And what consequent effect on the market or sport fishermen ? Extensive experiments are being conducted by various Federal agencies and conservation organizations to determine the uses , dangers and limitations of DDT , but their findings have not yet been finalized and released . Until the full potentialities of this powerful material are fully and universally understood , let us hope that its use will be regulated for the benefit of all and the detriment of none . HUSTACE H. POOR . Yonkers , N. Y. , July 28 , 1945 . Music Lover Protests To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Why must our ears be daily offended by the current crop of so-called " arrangements " by band leaders and conductors of the light classics ? Why must a medley of some noted composer 's music be boiled and simmered until it is presented as some tasteless pap ? Who could endure the offense to his palate if he were served a tenderloin steak that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victimized than others ? be so deformed by being capriciously tossed into strange keys , and distorted by bizarre rhythms ? Who would accept the offense to his eyes if he were offered a gargoyle for a Cellini goblet ? The other day I heard a contemporary " arrangement " of Foster 's " Jeannie With the Light Brown Hair . " It was like walking into a spring garden , anticipating the lovely , sweet scents of violets and hyacinths and being overwhelmed by skunk cabbage instead . Granted that arrangements are necessary to transcribe the original compositions for various instrumental and vocal groups , what purpose is served by these exceedingly bad arrangements ? No doubt they are very satisfying to the ego of obviously unoriginal musicians but they are an offense to the ears of people who love their music as ' it was originally conceived and who can find no justification for these derangements . : MARIAN DORF .

Charter and Constitution Holmes Ruling Held to Have Bearin on Aspect of Problem To THE EDITOR OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been adopted it is of vital imps tance that public opinion be informe on the question of the degree to whic the enforcement of the treaty must .1 form to the terms of the Constitutic of the United States . In 1920 the Supreme Court , declare itself on one aspect of this problem i the case of Missouri vs . Holland ( 2 , U. S. 416 ) . In this decision Justic Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed of that according to Article VI of the Cor stitution the supreme law of the 1-consists of : 1 , the Constitution it- ' 2 , laws of Congress " in pursuanc thereof , " and 3 , treaties " made and the authority of the United States . " The implication seems to be th treaties do not have to be " in pur. ance " of the Constitution .

It is also true that Justic Holmes said : " We do not mean to iv ply that there are no qualifications t the treaty-making power . " Howeve : he added : " It is obvious that thmay be matters of the sharpest ex gency for the national well-being th an act of Congress could not deal wit , but that a treaty followed by such act could . " The philosophy on which Justic Holmes relied in subordinating Amenc ment X to the treaty-making pos. might well be considered as applyin with even greater force to other part of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propheti eye to the future , the great juria stated : " When we are dealing with wort that also are a constituent act , like tl .

War Preparation Foreseen Stalin 's Remarks About Army and Navy Cause Speculation About Loan Dangers Inherent in DDT Insecticide Beneficial but Should Be Used With Great Care Army Staff Officers Blamed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In following the newspaper reports of the lack of coordination between the Army and the ODT director , it appears that the only ones to be penalized in the matter will be the GI 's . In an article published in an afternoon paper the following appears : " There are indications the Army is Revising its redeployment program and will send more men directly from Europe to the Pacific . Ferguson said that was his impression and that he regretted it . " If troops are deprived of opportunity to enjoy a furlough in the United States before going to the Pacific zone for the sole reason that some fairhaired staff officers , who now attempt to cover up , fell down in their jobs , then the men so deprived will have a just complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been relieved from their commands for lesser blunders .
