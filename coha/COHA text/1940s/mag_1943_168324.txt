Episcopalians have long been justifiably proud of their hymnal . Last week Episcopalians got an even better one : the Joint Commission on the Revision of the Hymnal , appointed in 1937 , produced the fruits of six years ' labors . <P> Of the revised Hymnal 's nearly 600 hymns ( an increase of about 40 ) 201 are new . Some hymns have been dropped . Most of these , like Tarry With Me , O My Saviour , were on the egocentric side . The current trend is toward theocentric hymns . Two surprising deletions : Julia Ward Howe 's Battle Hymn of the Republic , Tennyson 's Crossing the Bar . <P> Added starters : ten Christmas carols , some of the great German chorals whose sweep and power make them ideal for congregational singing . Many an old hymn has changed its tune . Hymns that were too high-pitched for most singers have been set in a lower key . Except in cases where the hymn is one of praise or prayer , Amen has been dropped from endings. + <P> Some notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Or West , Evelyn Atwater Cummins ' popular poem , <P> The King 's Highway ; Christina Rossetti 's somber In the Bleak Mid-Winter ; a Negro spiritual , Were You There When They Crucified My Lord ? <P> +Dr . William Temple , Archbishop of Canterbury , once observed : " The singing of Amen at the end of a hymn always is a bore-why do we keep on doing it ? "
