Around 4 o'clock in the morning , T. W. A. 's transcontinental Flight 6 , eastbound from Kansas City , was over the Missouri River just west of Lambert-St . Louis Field . A few minutes before , the airport radio had given veteran Pilot P. T. W. Scott the St. Louis weather . The ceiling was down to the bare CAA minimum : 400 feet . There were scattered clouds at 200 , visibility was two miles . Wind : north northeast 6 ( miles an hour ) . With eleven passengers behind in berths and seats , Captain Scott and his co-pilot had a job on their hands that has long since ceased to worry good airmen : an instrument landing . <P> It was drizzling on the ground and the neon lights on the hangar roofs were haloed in mist when Flight 6 rumbled overhead toward the radio range . The sound of her engines died in the clouds . East of the field Pilot Scott made his turn , headed west , letting down along the beam . From the tower the operators saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " marking the end of Run way No. 1 ( east-west ) . Pilot Scott was a little high , perhaps by miscalculation , perhaps by design . Flight 6 , down to around 300 feet , zipped west over the runway , made a gentle turn to the left . It looked as if Scott had decided to circle the field , make his landing on Runway No. 6 ( south-north ) into the gentle wind . <P> But somehow he had got too low . The left wing of the DC-3 brushed a high maple tree . There was a blinding blue flash as the ship ripped through a high-tension line , a deafening crash , silence . Then a woman began to cry . <P> By automobile it was only a minute or two from the field to the wreck . Trip 6 , burst asunder like a watermelon , lay not 200 feet away from a schoolhouse in the little village of Bridgeton . The plane was broken in two , the two parts nearly at right angles . Amazingly , ten of her passengers were alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , cut . but still on her feet . The eleventh passenger , a T. W. A. employe , lay dead near by , crushed by a telephone pole . Not far off was the body of Captain Scott . Somehow , it appeared , he had made the one bad mistake that no airman can ever make twice . <P> Flight 6 's crash was the fourth fatal airline accident ( the fifth to wreck an airliner ) since President Roosevelt reorganized the independent Civil Aeronautics Authority last summer , made it a dependency of the Department of Commerce and abolished the old Air Safety Board . At that time U. S. airlines had flown 15 months without a fatal crash . This week , as Pilot Scott was buried , fellow airmen recalled their warning , given to the President by the airlines and the Air Line Pilots ' Association , and echoed by Senator Pat McCarran , author of the old CAA law : that to keelhaul a successful agency was to invite disaster . <P> Day of the St. Louis crash . Pat McCarran stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring this matter to the attention of the Senate . " said he , " in order that they may know that we were right in the first instance when we passed the act creating an independent agency . . . . When the Safety Board was abolished , when the CAA . . . was sent back into the Department of Commerce , chaos and confusion resulted . . . . "
