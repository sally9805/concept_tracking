Henceforth the well-dressed Soviet diplomat will wear a dramatic new uniform . But simplicity is the keynote . A simple , double-breasted suit of midnight black is the foundation . Coat cuffs are four inches , and heavily embroidered with gold acanthus leaves . Gold buttons , gold shoulder boards , and lapels thickly laced with gold galloons provide distinguished color .
