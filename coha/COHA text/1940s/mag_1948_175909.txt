Toward midnight on the 30th day of the Communist siege , the weary defenders of walled and moated Yinghsien prepared to repel another assault . Outposts had spotted a Red force moving on the Shansi Province town from the southwest . <P> At that same moment , sentries on an opposite corner of the wall rubbed their eyes . A flock of black sheep was emerging from the night like a moving blot . When the animals reached the wide moat in front of the wall they plunged in , began swimming across ; yet there were no visible herdsmen . A sentry fired into the flock . One of the dark objects in the moat erupted in a geyser of flame and water . Then men on the wall witnessed an amazing thing : some of the sheep seemed to be flipping off their black wool skins and running away on their hind legs . <P> Defenders opened fire with machine guns . Several more sheep exploded . When it was all over , 70 sheep and 26 Communists in sheep 's clothing lay dead or wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . <P> The 70 head of mutton , reported Yinghsien 's commander , would be a welcome addition to the garrison 's diet .
