Charles Augustus Lindbergh called on War Secretary Henry L. Stimson , offered to serve his country as a soldier , preferably in the Air Corps . Mr. Stimson gave Citizen Lindbergh a job as a civilian expert , doing research on a mysterious " commercial project " for the War Department . <P> Airman Lindbergh took the job offered , whether he liked it or not , then ducked into the office of his old America First crony , Senator Burt Wheeler . For half an hour they chewed a dark and bitter cud , while newsmen and photographers gathered outside .
