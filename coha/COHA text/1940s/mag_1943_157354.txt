German abuse of Sweden 's neutrality long ago aroused the normally placid Swedes . Last week they seethed over two fresh incidents : <P> &gt; An armed German merchant ship had fired on the Swedish submarine Broken in Swedish territorial waters . When the Swedish Government protested , the German Government announced that the attack was justified because the submarine had maneuvered in a combatlike manner . <P> &gt; Searchers for the Swedish submarine Ulven , lost April 16 near the spot where the Draken was attacked , found German mines moored in Swedish waters . Presumably the Ulven struck a mine . <P> A blunt Swedish note last week rejected the German explanation of the Draken incident , added another protest on the finding of the mines . Said the note : " Swedish warships have been ordered to intervene against ships of warring powers laying mines or firing at other vessels in Swedish territorial waters . " <P> This was no empty threat . Since Neighboring Norway and Denmark were invaded in 1940 , Swedish airmen and antiaircraftmen have shot down scores of German planes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedes do not want to go to war with Germany . But they also know that Germany , amply occupied elsewhere , does not want to go to war with them .
