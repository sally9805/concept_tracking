Maybe Democratic Boss Ed Flynn ( who comes from The Bronx , got to be Franklin Roosevelt 's right-hand man ) was throwing a Brooklyn boy to the lions . <P> Maybe , instead , he was trying to put a knife in Franklin Roosevelt 's frantic little friend Fiorello LaGuardia . It all depended on how you looked at it , when Boss Flynn handed Brooklyn 's blue-eyed , stocky District Attorney William O'Dwyer the job of running against LaGuardia for mayor of New York City . <P> The Little Flower took to the air this week , said he will be a third-term candidate for mayor , come what may , keep his Washington post as Civilian Defense Administrator too . He will run as before on a Fusion ticket , will have the support of the American Labor Party . <P> To be sure of winning , he will need lots of Republican votes , for Irish-born ( in County Mayo ) , 51 - year- old Judge O'Dwyer is not exactly a pushover . A onetime longshoreman , plasterer 's helper , he started pounding New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . <P> But cynical Brooklyn voters , knowing the New Deal will be solidly behind the President 's Little Flower , thought Ed Flynn was probably setting up Brooklyn 's O'Dwyer just to knock him over .
