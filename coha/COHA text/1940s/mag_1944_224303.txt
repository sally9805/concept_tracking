Norman Raymond Frederick Maier is a man who has made his name &; fame by driving rats crazy . For his experiments in rat frustration , the American Association for the Advancement of Science , in 1938 awarded him a $1,000 prize . Now Professor Maier , a University of Michigan psychologist , believes that his studies of rats have led him to a solution of the No. 1 contemporary problem in human frustration : how to cure a defeated Germany of the disease of Naziism . Though his plan leaves many a question unanswered , it is a stimulating contribution to the simmering debate on a generous v. a vengeful peace . <P> Maier 's plan derives from experiments which upset orthodox psychological notions . He forced rats to jump at one of two differently marked cards , one of which led to food while the other only bruised the rats ' tender snouts . Then he switched the cards . Result : the rats became wildly neurotic . When repeatedly frustrated , a rat would throw itself blindly again &; again at an unyielding card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Maier concluded that the behavior of a completely frustrated creature differs from that of a normal one not in degree , as most psychologists have supposed , but in kind . Normally , a human being prevented from getting what he wants either finds a way around the obstacle or gives up his goal in favor of an attainable substitute . But a thoroughly thwarted individual loses all reasoning capacity and attacks his obstacle like a blindly baffled rat . The more he is punished , the stronger his fixation becomes . <P> From Rats to Nazis . Such , says Maier , was the condition of the German people after their defeat in World War I and the ensuing economic depression . Adolf Hitler 's strategy was psychologically brilliant . He heightened the Germans ' belligerence by increasing their frustration through Gestapo-enforced Verbote , then gave them objects of aggression : the Jews , the Communists , more Lebensraum . Maier observes significantly that even after the Germans had crushed the Jews and annexed Lebensraum in Austria and Czechoslovakia , their aggression continued ; their fixation would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor persuasion could have any effect . <P> Fortunately , thinks Maier , German frustration is likely to lead to its own partial cure . As bombing and invasion intensify the German people 's frustration and reduce their capacity for external aggression , Maier predicts that they will turn their pent-up fury on their own leaders , kill Hitler and other conspicuous Nazis . If they do not thus take matters into their own hands , he believes the solution of the German problem may be indefinitely prolonged . For he fears that war-guilt trials by the United Nations would only heighten the frustrated furor Teutonicus , while failure to punish the Nazi leaders would play spiritual havoc with the Allied peoples in their own long-frustrated desire to get at Hitler &; Co.
