From OPAdministrator Chester Bowles came bad news last week that soured every U.S. housewife . The news : the sugar supply , tighter now than at any time during the war , would be the last commodity freed from rationing-some time next spring , at the earliest . Even worse , the civilian allotment of sugar for the fourth quarter of this year would have to be cut 28% . Why ? screamed the housewives . <P> There was no shortage of reasons . The most obvious was that the war had cut production . The loss of the Philippines had cut out 900,000 tons a year . Cuba , trying to boost production , had cut its sugar cane too close to the ground in 1944 . Not only does it take 18 months for the growth to come back to normal , but Cuba this year suffered its worst drought in 86 years , resulting in a sugar loss of 900,000 tons . Hawaiian and Puerto Rican production was way down . <P> But this was only half the story . The real reason that sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . The " unhealthy economics and unholy politics " of sugar make the industry produce too much sugar between wars and too little during them . <P> Economically , producing sugar is a terrible risk : it requires big capital investment and reaps a microscopic profit margin . This has led to cutthroat competition between the domestic beet bloc and the cane producers in Cuba , Hawaii , Puerto Rico and the Philippines . To protect themselves , the beet men for 25 years operated an intense and effective lobby to get Congress to erect tariff walls and pay subsidies . In 1934 they jammed through a quota system that gave them 25% of the 6,000,000 tons of sugar consumed in the U.S. One of their most cogent arguments for protection : a strong domestic sugar industry would be invaluable in wartime . <P> But when war came , the beet men could not live up to their promise . In 1942 , labor shortages and high costs drove production down . By the end of this year the cumulative loss may be in excess of 2,000,000 tons . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up the difference . Until the drought , Cuba fortunately produced sugar far in excess of her peacetime quota . Now , the only hope for an end to rationing lies in the ability of Cuba to produce a bumper crop this spring . <P> Last week the Cuban crop was estimated at 4,500,000 tons . But no one was yet willing to predict that it would be enough .
