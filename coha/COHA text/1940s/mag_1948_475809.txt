BY EARLY 1926 practically every literate family in the United States , and probably several hundred thousand who simply had empty shelf space to fill , had at least one set of a conveniently small , sometimes rather odorous group of classics known as the Little Leather Library . The odor came not from the contents of the books but from the inexpensive leather used for bindings . Actually there was nothing really extraordinary about the volumes except the price , ten cents each , and the fact that they had been sold almost exclusively by mail . The enterprise might have gone on forever if , after the sale of 48,000,000 volumes , the firm of Sackheim and Scher-man had not run out of potential buyers ; there was some talk of foreign language editions , but this never came to much . It was at this point that the energetic , erudite young man who was chiefly responsible for the success of the project which Albert and Charles Boni had started hit on a new idea . Harry Scherman had burst into the book business by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and profit-making ) possibilities to be realized by giving away a tiny copy of Romeo and Juliet with every pound of chocolates . Before that Scher-man , a Canadian by birth , had fared rather miserably as a free-lance writer and somewhat better as a minor advertisingexecutive . By 1926 , when the Little Leather Library was rapidly losing its momentum , he was generally admitted to be one of the few authentic geniuses in the relatively unexplored field of selling by direct mail . Scherman reasoned that if he had been able to sell millions of classics at ten cents each by mail there was no reason he could n't sell at least a few thousand newly published books by the same method . At that time , as today , most Americans were far from a book store ; even in towns with populations of tens of thousands there usually was ? and is ? only one store that handles books , along with wallpaper , stationery , cut-glass vases , paper flowers , fountain pens , pencil sets , and ink of varying colors . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty reprints of already established best sellers . Scherman felt that there must be among the millions of great unread , particularly in that area then so casually dismissed by literary giants like H. L. Mencken as the " Bible Belt , " a respectable few who would buy at least one new book a month , if only to gain a certain social standing in their communities . Naturally , any such project had to have what in advertising parlance then and now is known as " prestige . " Scherman , a voracious and discriminating reader himself , could n't provide that . So he hired five judges who would , as his early advertisements pointed out , choose each month not just another book but the very best volume available , the most literary , the most important . The judges were Dorothy Canfield Fisher , the novelist , who was to represent the woman reader ; Heywood Broun , the nationally known and often idolized columnist , who was slightly less political then than he later became ; Henry Seidel Canby , the former Yale professor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Literature ; William Allen White , the carefully publicized country editor who , presumably , shared the tastes of thousands of Midwestern literati ; and Christopher Morley , who was a best-selling essayist , playwright , and novelist . To launch the project , Scherman bought space in a few of the intellectual journals and the weekly book-review sections of newspapers , pointing out that it was now possible to " have handed to you by the postman , the book you intend to read . " In addition , quite naturally , he solicited by direct mail appeals those persons whose names are always appearing on one mail order list or another . And by April of 1926 the judges had chosen and delivered a now-forgotten novel by a still-productive author , Lolly Willowes , by Sylvia Townsend Warner . That first month 4,700 copies of the book were sent out , and the second selection , one of the lesser efforts of T. S. Stribling , had 12,000 takers . After that , Harry Scherman 's Book-of-the-Month Club had interested ? and , in some cases , frightened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book sellers . II A vEW months earlier Harold Guinzburg , the youthful head of the highly respectable Viking Press , had started work on an almost identical idea ; but , whoever had the notion first , Scherman was in business before him . Guinzburg , an astute publisher but not an expert in the field of direct mail solicitation , launched the Literary Guild with somewhat less hoopla than Scherman 's club , but he did acknowledge the fact that in Germany book clubs , although most of them distributed cheap reprints of classics , were already an established institution ; and he compared his Literary Guild to the flourishing Theater Guild , both of them means of bringing culture to large numbers of people . Guinzburg also selected a board of judges , headed by the scholar-historian , Carl Van Doren . The Guild 's board changed frequently , partly because , as trade legend had it , Van Doren sometimes did n't remember to allow his fellow judges to read the books ; he chose what he liked and what he thought the public ought to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guild 's board included people like novelist Julia Peterkin , critic Joseph Wood Krutch , and educator Glenn Frank . The Guild got off to a goad start but its growth was slow . The first months were promising , but deficits mounted . Book-of-the Month , on the other hand , lost money during its first year of operation , but never has since . By 1929 the Guild was finding the going so heavy that Guinzburg sold 49 per cent of the stock to Nelson Doubleday . Two years before Doubleday thus entered the book club business ? with the resources of the largest , most successful , certainly most productive general publishing house in the business behind him ? a quiet , introspective young man , three years out of Columbia , joined the Guild , principally to edit its monthly bulletin , Pilings . John Beecroft was hired by Milo Sutliff , one of Doubleday 's bright young men at selling . Nobody paid much attention to Bee-croft at the time , and although recent Guild press releases are likely to dismiss a temporary absence from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go in the midst of the depression as an economy measure . The Guild was still losing money . In 1935 , after a tour in Europe , including a lengthy stay in Soviet Russia , and a confused few months doing something or other ? no one , including Beecroft , seems to be quite sure what ? for Paramount News , Sutliff rehired him . By that time , Doubleday had purchased all the Guild stock ; Van Doren had retired as a judge , and Burton Rascoe , the critic , columnist , and eternal dissident , was choosing the monthly Guild selections . Two years later Rascoe also retired , and Beecroft took over as the Guild 's chief and only judge . The organization was already making a profit ; Doubleday had made certain of that when , almost immediately after assuming full control , he added postage charges to the cost of the books to subscribers . He saved $30,000 a month that way , and , surprisingly , there were only about a hundred protests . EECROPT , a short , red-faced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three most powerful figures in the publishing business , chose as his first selection Liam O'Flaherty 's unbelievably Gaelic Hunger . Guild membership almost immediately began to expand ; a few months later Beecroft made the largest guarantee of sales in the history of the book business ; he promised to sell at least 50,000 copies of Eve Curie 's biography of her mother . As the Guild became an even more profitable Doubleday enterprise , Nelson Doubleday launched other book clubs , for different audiences , for books that were cheaper in price and frequently in content as well . At least two of them , the Book League of America and the Dollar Book Club , were launched or taken over mainly to get rid of Doubleday remainders that were distressingly and unprofitably piled in Doubleday warehouses . By 1940 , Bee-croft , who was then choosing books for all three clubs , was powerful enough to change that . He selected a book published by an outside firm . There was mumbling among the Doubleday sales staff , but Bee-croft survived . Today he chooses every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the chief and ? for all practical purposes ? only judge not only for the Guild , the Dollar Book Club , and the League , but also Double-day 's Family Reading Club and the Home Book Club . True , he has a staff of four readers in his office and two outside , but the final choices are always completely and emphatically his own . He reads at least twelve books a week , cover to cover , and usually skims up to twenty-five others . During Beecroft 's tenure as an editor , Doubleday has made at least two tests to find out what kind of people belong to its clubs and what they like to read . The tests , to practically nobody 's surprise , showed that most of the members are women , that they usually have at least a high school education , and that they live in towns with populations of less than 100,000 . Beecroft had only a cursory interest in the results . In the first place , he feels that most readers , when questioned about their tastes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high cultural quality rather than admit what they really like to read . For quotation , he asserts that he is successful in pleasing his club 's members only because " I have the same reading tastes as thousands of other readers . " Actually , he will admit to a few basic rules for his selections . Most readers , he believes , do n't like flashbacks ; they want a forward-moving , fast-paced story with a plot . " Something , " he will tell you , " has to happen to somebody . " As for publishers ' frequently too enthusiastic estimates of their own books , for the most part Beecroft distrusts them . Several times a month the head of one house or another will call to impart the happy news that he is sending in a novel that is " a natural " for one of the clubs ; almost invariably , Beecroft says , he finds it is n't . Former employees , of whom several are still in the publishing business , are likely to explain his success not as an intellectual process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff are studiedly noncommittal. but everyone who knows him admits that , so far as his personal tastes are concerned , Beecroft , who occasionally does relax with a mystery , would prefer something of the intellectual weight of Boswell 's Life of Johnson or Gibbon 's Decline and Fall to almost any of the books he has chosen for his clubs . M ILO SUTLIFF , who from 1944 until this spring was president of the Guild and Doubleday 's vice-president in charge of sales , is a sharp-faced , alert man who has been in the publishing business for more than twenty-eight years . Sutliff has n't actually written much of the clubs ' advertising and promotion copy , but he has approved it . The membership of the Guild itself is generally admitted to be the most diverse and sophisticated of the Doubleday clubs . The element of sex has never noticeably interfered with the sale of any Guild selection , a fact of which Sutliff 's copywriters have been aware . As a result , a recent Guild mailer soliciting new members proclaimed the merits of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful young girl proportioned in a familiar and generous manner , and each heroine was about to be kissed by an equally beautiful young man . Members of the Book League , who receive what is honestly described as a " handsomely-bound classic " alternating with best sellers , are , to judge from the League 's literature , also in favor of amicability between the sexes . Norah Lofts ' Silver Nutmeg , a recent League book , is illustrated in the monthly folder in the same manneras the Guild books , and the descriptive copy points out , among other equally alluring facts , that the novel is " . .. laid in the romantic East Indies and is filled with intrigue , torrid love , and powerful suspense . " Choices of the Family Reading Club are , as the name would indicate , aimed at a broader audience including , quite naturally , adolescent sons and daughters who once in a while like to read something between class assignments . Although it is not always possible , a strong moral tone helps to recommend a novel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of Agnes Sligh Turnbull 's The Bishop 's antle has , as its largest illustration , a picture of a handsome but ascetic young minister whose troubled face is flooded with celestial light . The novel , the copy asserts , is filled with " . . . a deep strain of faith , hope , and courage which will reaffirm your faith in the goodness of man . " However , apparently on the reasonable theory that there will be some of the club 's members who do n't attend church services regularly , a smaller illustration shows the minister , whose name is Hilary , looking at an obviously full-grown young lady ; the young lady , whose name is Alexa , is staring back , her mind quite patently not on ecclesiastical matters . Alexa , the description of the book admits , is " beautiful , young , vital , and hot-headed in the pursuit of pleasure . " Apparently , however , everything comes out all right , both for teenagers and their elders , because " through it all is the story of Alexa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletins are not alone responsible for attracting more than a million and a half members to the Guild , about half a million to the Dollar Book Club , and at least a quarter of a million to the Book League . The Guild itself mails out more than six million circulars a year and spends more than $700,000 on advertising . In addition , anyone who wishes ? and many thousands of readers have so wished ? can join the Guild ( as well as the BOMC , as it is known to the trade ) through his local department store and charge the cost of the books to his account . Finally , anybody who receives a Montgomery Ward catalogue can not help noting that it it as easy to join the Guild as to buy a gingham dress ; a penny postcard will do . Sears , Roebuck , incidentally , has its own club , the People 's . At present , in all of the advertisements , in each of the circulars , in almost every bulletin , not only for the Doubleday clubs but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually in bigger and blacker type than any other , is " free . " There is a free book on joining ; in the case of the Guild , a free book is given after the purchase of four . Some clubs give a free volume on joining plus a dividend with only two purchases and others only on joining . But the advertising copy is unvarying ; there is always a free book offered a reader , although most clubs require members to buy at least four books a year . Lewis Gannett , daily book critic of the New York Herald Tribune and himself a judge of one of the smaller groups , the Non-Fiction Book Club , at a P.E.N . banquet in New York recently rather wistfully observed that the advertising he sees these days does n't " look like an attempt to get better books for the public . .. . It looks like a large store bargain counter . " III I N THE beginning , Harry Scherman operated on the theory that free inducements were unnecessary , that club selections could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscriptions , and members of the Book-of-the-Month Club were asked to take all of the judges ' twelve choices every year . But books are , to most Americans , not considered necessities , and during the depression the clubs were the first and hardest hit organizations in the publishing business . In its first year of operation , the BOMC had 40,000 subscribers ; by the end of its second , 80,000 persons had joined . By April of 1928 there were 100,000 members , but in 1929 the membership dropped from 111,000 to less than 90,000 . In 1930 the club did not grow at all ; and Scherman thereupon invented the book dividend plan , which in effect worked like a price cut . Today the BOMC , whose judges now choose thirteen selections a year , gives one free book with every two purchased . The result is that a member gets at least fifty cents ' worth of free books for every dollar spent . The club continued not to grow in 1931 and 1932 , but it did remain in the black , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both potential and actual , that its judges chose the outstanding volume published within every thirty-day period , either fiction or nonfiction . T HERE have been only two changes in the judging staff since the beginning , both caused by deaths , those of Heywood Broun and of William Allen White . One was replaced in 1944 by Clifton Fadiman , the then oftcn vituperative book critic of the New Torker , the other by John P. Marquand , the fiction chronicler of the foibles of New Englanders . As in the early days , the judges meet at the BOMC 's headquarters on Madison Avenue in New York once every month , usually for no longer than two or three hours . Before their arrival , they have read from five to eight books on the club 's " A " list , those selected by a preliminary reading staff headed by Amy Loveman of the Saturday Review as the most likely choices . Others of the some 200 books now submitted by publishers every month are classified as " B " and " C " books . Occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the " A " list , frequently on the insistence of Dorothy Canfield Fisher , who reads more books every month than any of the other judges , or of Dr. Canby , the chairman . General agreement rather than a majority vote governs the selection , but more often than not the choice is unanimous . The judges have always been well paid for what is at best a part-time job , but today they are among the highest paid personnel in the book business , averaging from $22,000 to $25,000 each , including bonuses which , in 1946 , averaged $5,000 . The club 's literature inevitably declares that , as a result of the judges ' selections , such now prosperous and respected writers as John Steinbeck , Pearl Buck , and Richard Wright reached a huge national audience for the first time ; it is less likely to take credit for such early mistakes as the choice in 1929 of Joan Lowell 's first-class literary hoax , Cradle of the Deep . Until last year , most of the details of the BOMC 's financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that Scherman himself , who became president of the club in 1930 , owned along with his family a major share of the stock . When early last year 300,000 shares of the stock , of which Scherman and his family controlled more than 92 per cent , were offered for sale , the full story of the club had to be made public , according to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission . Scherman himself owned 354,000 shares ; his wife , a daughter , and a son owned 132,000 shares apiece . After the stock was sold ? mainly , it was said , for tax purposes ? the club 's president and his family still owned more than 60 per cent of the stock of the organization he had built up , despite its phenominal growth during the past fifteen years and the new financing . Incidentally , Scherman , not the judges , chooses the books sent out as dividends with the aid of a poll taken of the reactions of a cross-section of readers . The dividend choice guarantees a royalty of $30,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is almost invariably divided , fifty-fifty , between the author and the publisher . For a regular monthly selection , the club guarantees a royalty of $80,000 , also equally divided between the publisher and the writer , and the take on almost all selections these days is higher than that . Although it happens less frequently now than it did in the early days of the BOMC , five-figure checks have an intriguing habit of reaching authors at a time when they find it impossible to pay the month 's rent . Thomas Duncan , who had previously written two widely and favorably reviewed novels that were even more widely unread , spent ten years working on Gus the Great , supporting himself and his wife in a rather precarious manner by odd jobs , including occasional magic shows in the Middle and South West , living much of the time in trailer camps . His book was accepted by the BOMC with only one proviso ; it had to be cut . Duncan agreed , and a few days after he finished the job a check for $50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , the book club field was , except for the various religious and special-interest clubs , completely dominated by Doubleday and the BOMC . A few months before Pearl Harbor George Braziller , a politically alert young man who was collecting $25 a week as a clerk in that publishing graveyard , a remainder house , decided after reading a few of the books for which it was difficult to find buyers , even at a retail price of forty-nine cents each , that a number of excellent volumes each month were published and forgotten . So Braziller decided to go into the book club business . He borrowed $25 from a more prosperous friend and , during his first month in business , sent out ten copies of Edwin Lan-ham 's The Liberals to other friends . The idea took , and Braziller 's progressive , some observers say excessively left-wing , Book Find Club was launched . It was successful from the beginning ; it had to be . Braziller borrowed money for a second time , but he had only enough to stay in business for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60,000 members . N ATURALLY , as the book clubs have grown , as they have become enviably profitable bonanzas not only for those operating them and authors but for publishers as well , the book trade , at first merely restive , became critical and then hostile , because of the element of price competition . As early as 1929 , the American Booksellers Association issued a blistering blast , then aimed mainly at the Book-of-the-Month Club . " There is no best ' book of the month , " the statement declared . " . . . the attempt to choose a best ' book is an absurdity . .. an intellectual sham . The self-styled ' clubs ' are commercial organizations . .. run for profit . . .. The judgments of their paid committees .. . are expected to produce a commercial profit . " The books selected are , moreover , the statement argued , designed primarily to appeal to a mass audience ; art is secondary if , indeed , it is considered at all . The result , the book sellers concluded , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and allow others , equally worthy or , perhaps more so , to be completely neglected . By now , the debate has gone beyond the talking stage and is an open battle , both economic and cultural . Paul Elder , a book seller in San Francisco , recently made a major frontal attack on the Bookof-the-Month Club 's current method of selecting , in addition to the monthly selection or dual selection , a handful of other books which it feels members may prefer . If a member buys a BOMC " alternate " he receives the same credit for bonus books as if he had taken the selection itself . This method , Elder argued , worked against the interest of book stores . Why , Elder wanted to know , would anybody in his right mind buy a book from a retailer if he could get it at the same pricefrom the BOMC ? plus half credit toward a bonus book ? As a result , Elder concluded , " Our displays and promotional efforts will be devoted to worthy publications which have been withheld from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the wartime publishing boom has ended , when thousands of people who began to read during the war have returned to the movies , the radio , and drives in the country , the entire publishing business is divided by the argument concerning the merit , if any , of the book clubs . Sutliff , speaking at the same P.E.N . dinner at which Gannett criticized the clubs ' advertising , admitted that , of the eight million who during the past twenty-two years have been members of one club or another , five million have left . What , he asked , has happened to those five million ? Are they still reading books ? If so , do they buy the books from a retailer or borrow them from the library ? Many book sellers have argued , and will continue to do so , that a major percentage of the five million are no longer reading books at all . But even more basic , from the standpoint of most book sellers and many publishers , are questions like these ( which will be examined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the clubs has been to Tower reading tastes or to raise them ; whether the books selected arc , even in the eyes of the judges , the best books available or only the most sensational and those most likely to please ? and not irritate ? the largest possible audience ; whether club choices are aimed toward sensationalism or toward literary merit . As one popular author , whose most recent book was a Book-of-the-Month Club dividend choice , put it , " The check was nice , and so was the publicity . But it scares me . It honest to God scares me . Maybe I 've contributed to a Frankenstein . "
