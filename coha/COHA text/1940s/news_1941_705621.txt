txt Every time the Germans finish one offensive the intermission before the next is filled with murmurs of peace . It happened after the Polish campaign , after the fall of France , after Japan joined the Axis , after the first pact of Vienna tied up most of the Balkans , and now again when the curtain falls on Crete and the stage is being noisily set for another act . This is as : nuch a part of the war as any military action . Hitler is like a prizefighter at the end of a round who hopes that his opponent has had enough . He himself has had enough ; he would like nothing better than to stop- if he could be proclaimed champion . The peace feelers he puts out again and again prove this , but they are also designed to test the effect of the last glow . If it is not a knockout , he has to measure the risks of the next round , test the reactions on the sidelines . Strange consequence of victory after victory , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up the fight . This time the usual barrage of peace rumors is directed on the United States . They are so thick in Washington that the President felt obliged at yesterday 's press conference to accuse the Nazis of spreading the story that Ambassador Winant flew home to report that conditions in Britain are so desperate that the British would-have to discuss peace unless full American support was immediately forthcoming . Hitler Weighs New Hazards Obviously this is part of the campaign to keep the United States out of war . If we could be discouraged to the point of advising Britain that she could not count on our help in time and would better settle on the basis of the present status quo  --  the offer that keeps bobbing up in all reports ? it would at the same time conveniently enable Hitler to end his war on his own terms and at his own time , before the immense and hazardous overseas adventure he now faces in the Middle East . There is not the slightest evidence , in published reports or in the private accounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in whispers . Neither Mr. Winant nor any/ other of the assorted envoys shuttling back and forth to London brings any such suggestion . Every sign , including the two latest by-elections and the almost unanimous vote of the Labor party congress , points in the opposite direction . The morale of the people seems to continue miraculously high . Although they have practicatly given up France and lost their last foothold in Europe , at this moment British leaders boast that the main lines of their defense are unbroken and that the empire was never before so consciously united . Nevertheless , it is a black moment . False peace rumors are astutely timed to coincide with true reports that the German counter-blockade endangers the food supply of the islands ; that the people are criticizing the conduct of the war , that shipping losses far exceed capacity for replacement and air power is unequal , as was proved in Crete , to the defense of two fronts . There is no doubt that Mr. Winant hurried back to tell what England needs most , and to make clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk of peace , but he did come to say that the war has reached a crisis and to discuss the new plans and strategy the British are forced in desperation to substitute for traditional ideas . , Hard Choice for France The position of France is part of the crisis . The sharp warning delivered by Secretary Hull to the Vichy government is a last-minute attempt to bolster up General Weygand and give Marshal Pdtain an " out " against full submission to German demands . Until a policy of sympathy and conciliation proves a failure , this government has been unwilling to follow the harsher line of the British in respect to France . Washington 's view hitherto has been that France is in a wholly abnormal situation , defeated though not out of the war , under the Nazi yoke in Europe yet retaining some freedom of action in Africa . But now it is clear that nothing in human affairs remains static . The armistice terms that could have been borne for a period of months are impossible if extended over a period of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision of a year ago . Either Pdtain and Weygand have to go farther with Hitler or make a stand against him in that part of France which is still free . Even if they wish , the French can not stop at " economic collaboration . " This is proved in Turkey . It is proved in Russia . The final defection of France , if it comes , is not only more disastrous than a dozen lost battles . It reveals one of the most dangerous results of the occupation of Europe ; for millions who live in torment and revolt under Nazi rule , we can not forget that other millions are acquiring a vested interest in Germany victory . France is the best proof that there is no status quo to settle for . In the name of peace Hitler builds up a system and a coalition under which there never can be peace . Even the defeated can not escape being turned into an instrument of war . The choice he has given the world is not war or peace ; it is only to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
