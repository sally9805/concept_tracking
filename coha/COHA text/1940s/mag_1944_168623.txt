To the crew of the Fortress Passion Flower it was their 18th and biggest mission-the first big U.S. raid on Berlin . In the ball turret Gunner Dick Litherland of St. Francis , Ill. sweated it out-the toughest battle U.S. airmen had fought over Europe . Sixty-eight Fortresses and Liberators failed to return , but Passion Flower dragged home on three engines . Gunner Litherland told this story . <P> It took about an hour in the briefing hut to get all the dope . Then the chaplains came in . A Protestant guy and a Catholic guy . Each had a service at the same time in opposite corners . Just said a little prayer for us and then wished us luck . Most everybody goes to one or the other . Some went on to Confession , too . <P> By 6:30 we were wandering down to the ship . The ground crew was just finishing up . It was getting light-grey dawn . <P> Before the Takeoff . Everything was ready so there was nothing to do but horse around , wrestling with Henry Zaborsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground crew . It was so warm that morning we were hot in flying clothes . And so still the wind sock was hanging limp . <P> When we taxied out about 8:15 it was broad daylight . We circled up &; up over the field until we were above the clouds . While we were getting into formation we could see hundreds of other Forts coming up at other places to make other formations . Berlin ! Wow ! <P> A Little Trouble . Over Europe , just as we saw the first flak , we had a little trouble . The skipper said " Number Four engine is actin ' up , but I 'm gon na take her on , anyway . " He feathered it a while , then unfeathered just before we hit the German border . <P> Lot of flak around Hanover but not a fighter until we got near the IP ( Initial Point ) . That first baby came in dead ahead-zingity dow . Then there were about 25 of them-110s , 190s and 410s-the 190s are the worst . <P> Those 110s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation with machine guns blinking , then they came up behind and threw their rockets our way . <P> Friday Gets His First . A little past noon , Friday Weitzel , our right waist gunner , got his first German fighter . First the left waist , Curly Carroll , fired a few bursts into him as he came boring down through the high formation . <P> I shot him some from my ball turret . Then Friday let him have it as he came through the other side . It just tore his tail off as though a big fist had twisted it . One guy baled out and we saw his chute open . <P> That first pass hurt our formation a lot . Forts were goin ' down off our left wing-bing , bing , bing . Guys came balin ' out of all but one . That one blew up-no pieces , even as big as a wheel , just tiny junk flyin ' through the air . <P> Another went into a funny flat loop with a full bomb load . Chutes came popping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you begin to sweat . Our fighters were dog-fighting all around with their fighters-so many things you could n't watch ' em all at once . <P> Before I knew it the bombardier was saying " Bombs away " into the interphone . Everybody was a little relieved . <P> Smart-in Some Ways . Even with all the fighters you could see Berlin plain . The prettiest city I ever seen from the air , prettier than Paris , laid out so perfectly . Those krauts are smart Joes in some ways .
