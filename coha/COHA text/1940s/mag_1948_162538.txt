Since then , De Gaulle 's icy isolationism has been thawing . <P> This week , in a speech at Compigne , De Gaulle cried : " It is necessary that the efforts of the old Europe and those of America be joined to put our poor old world back on its feet . This means , with out any doubt , that the U.S. lend us large and prolonged help in the economic field but , more than that , it is clear that their support should be spread at the same time to the field of defense in as precise and explicit a manner as the Marshall Plan does on credit and imports . " <P> He envisioned a mighty comity of nations , 250,000,000 strong , opposing Russia 's " docile , patient . . . 180,000,000 , all manipulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Western coalition , De Gaulle conceded . " The German states , federating as they wished , would naturally find their place . "
