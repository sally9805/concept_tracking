The simple but formidable problem now before Congress is how to get more &; more &; more golden eggs without killing the goose . <P> The President demanded last week that $9.000,000,000 more in taxes be levied this year . Last year , the total of all Federal receipts was $8,269,000,000-three quarters of a billion less than the President now wanted in new taxes ! <P> Like a schoolmaster caning a child and then roaring that he must not weep , the President had said : " Until this job is done , until this war is won , we will not talk of burdens . " Congressmen crept off into their cloakrooms to groan in quiet-all except the good gooseherds of the tax committees : North Carolina 's hamhanded , aged ( 78 ) Representative Robert L. Doughton , and Georgia 's urbane , grey ( 64 ) Senator Walter F. George . <P> Said bent , big-boned " Old Muley " Doughton : " We face the job of performing a delicate major operation , and when a doctor has to do that , he studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without extreme care , or he will lose the patient . <P> " As Senator George has so aptly said , we can confiscate only once , but we can tax perpetually , provided we preserve free enterprise . " <P> No one knew off-hand how much taxes the nation could bear . Messrs . Doughton &; George were prepared to reserve judgment until the March 15 egg had been safely laid . Probability : no tax bill until mid-April , at the earliest . <P> The President 's general tax proposals were : 1 ) increase individual and corporate income taxes ; 2 ) cut exemptions on estate and gift taxes ; 3 ) revise upward the present corporate excess-profits tax ; 4 ) perhaps-only perhaps-consider a temporary general sales tax , which the Administration has long and strongly opposed ; consider selective excise taxes ; 5 ) make the interest from future issues of state , municipal and authority bonds subject to Federal income taxes ; 6 ) re-examine depletion allowances and special tax provisions affecting oil and gas firms , life-insurance companies ; 7 ) increase Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
