Not since the London mob cheered gaudy Lord Nelson had any sailorman returned to port from victories so vast . But Americans were inclined to be a little vague about the U.S. Navy 's white-haired , pink-cheeked Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , who had directed the Battle of the Pacific from a desk . He had never courted publicity . He had accumulated stiff titles like CINCPAC or CINCPOA instead of nicknames . And he had spent most of the war at Pearl Harbor and Guam . <P> Also the public had been welcoming Army heroes on a production-line basis and was a little throat-weary . Nevertheless the Navy was determined to see that its senior hero got his due . <P> When the Admiral arrived in Washington , D.C. , the Navy had gathered up 5,000 troops , a half-dozen bands , artillery and captured Japanese equipment for a parade to end parades , had gassed up a thousand airplanes to fly overhead . The show pulled a bigger house than either Generals Eisenhower or Wainwright-more than a million people cheered from the sidewalks . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threw 274 tons of ticker tape and letterheads ( on account of the paper shortage General Eisenhower got but 77 tons ) . A huge ship 's bow with five stars , hawsers , other seagoing gizmos was built in front of City Hall , and vast mobs gathered to watch the Admiral go aboard to the shrill of bosuns ' calls . In the evening 2,000 people paid $15 a plate to attend a posh Waldorf-Astoria dinner where Admiral Nimitz* was introduced by Nelson Rockefeller . <P> Competition from a Cloud . Amid all this uproar the Admiral carried himself with aplomb ; smiled , waved , saluted manfully , honestly appeared to enjoy himself . But it was evident that he would have been more at home at fleet headquarters than on the poop deck of an open automobile on Broadway . <P> Minor actors repeatedly stole the show . New York 's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia did it by raising a hand and commanding , " Come out , sun , " when a cloud put the City Hall square in shade . The cloud passed .

But they squealed at the sight of Marine Ace Gregory ( " Pappy " ) Boyington , giggled and waved as a 17-year-old marine winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor bawled from a jeep : " Come and kiss me , girls ! " <P> And like many another seadog since the days of Salamis , Fleet Admiral Nimitz seemed to yaw a little in the shifting winds of press conferences . Example : of the atomic bomb he said , " It is a weapon which will undoubtedly add to the complexities of field commanders . " <P> Where the Bloom Is on the Sage . But all this took place on the eastern seaboard . When it was over , Texas-born Chester Nimitz flew back to the Lone Star State , where every man , woman and child knew all about him and felt he had contributed mightily to the greater glory of the greatest warrior race in history .
