One cloudy afternoon last week , twelve B-26 light bombers roared down the runway at Floyd Bennett Field , took off and disappeared to rendezvous for a bombing run on New York City . Minutes later , three radar stations in outlying areas , two manned by Canadians , one by Americans , had picked up the bombers and flashed instructions by radio to eight waiting Canadian Vampire jets and eight U.S. F47 Thunderbolts . " Operation Metropolis , " a simulated air attack and defense of New York , was underway . <P> In the first peacetime U.S.-Canadian joint air maneuver , 240 R.C.A.F. reserves worked from a defense control center with the U.S. Air National Guard . Every bomber was intercepted by the defending fighters before it got within range of its target . Limited and simple as the problem was , it demonstrated , said the R.C.A.F. , " the ability of the Canadian Air Reservists and United States Air National Guardsmen to integrate forces in the event of an emergency . " <P> The maneuver was one more small piece in the growing pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool of officers and men who know how both services work . Recently Canada 's Naval Air Group 18 finished an intensive three-month course at Quonset Point , R.I. With U.S. pilots , they concentrated on detecting and bombing schnorkel submarines . This month , the Canadian destroyer Halda spent two weeks training in Chesapeake Bay , then sailed with a U.S. Navy amphibious force for a practice assault on the coast of Labrador . <P> Three weeks ago such team work got a priority policy rating from the North Atlantic Treaty Defense Committee .
