. MiniverHe was , like his father , a timeless person , uninfluencedby his own age and unconscious of other people 's . Judy was quite different . She was as typically nine now as she had been typically six , and three . Age , to her , was an important and exciting quality : she was never quite at ease with other children until she had asked them how old they were . As for Toby , he remained , in this as in most other matters , unfathomable . In childhood the daylight always fails too soon  --  except when there are going to be fireworks ; and then the sun dawdles intolerably on the threshold like a tedious guest . There were no clouds that day , and even after sunset the western sky remained obstinately full of pearl-grey light . It was not so bad for Vin , who was helping his father to pin Catherine-wheels on to the fence and to prop up rocket-sticks in bottles on the lawn ; but Judy and Toby , their noses pressed against the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that darkness had officially fallen and the show could begin . Swathed in coats and scarves , they went outGuy Fawkes ' Dayand sat in a row on the little flagged terrace . The evening might have been ordered with the fireworks ; it was cold , still , and starry , with a commendableabsence of moon . And when the first rocket went up Mrs. Miniver felt the customary pricking in her throat and knew that once again the enchantment was going to work . Some things  --  conjurers , ventriloquists , pantomimes  --  she enjoyedvicariously , by watching the children 's enjoyment ; but fireworks had for her a direct and magical appeal . Their attraction was more complexthan that of any other form of art . They had pattern and sequence , colour and sound , brilliance and mobility ; they had suspense , surprise , and a faint hint of danger ; above all , they had the supreme quality of transience , which puts the keenest edge on beauty and makes it touch some spring in the heart which more enduringexcellences can not reach . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Miniver herself , when buying fireworks , was apt to be led away by fantastic titles ; she would order Humming Spiders , Witches ' Cauldrons , Mines with Serpents , Bouquets of21Mrs . Miniver Guy Fawkes ' DayGerbes , and Devils among the Tailors , largely in order to see what they were like . But Clem knew that with fireworks , as with cocktails , the sober , familiar names usually produced the most interesting results . He laid out a certain amount on Roman Candles , Catherine-wheels , and Tourbillions , but for the most part he rightly concentrated on rockets . There was one bursting now , a delicate constellationof many-coloured stars which drifted down and lingered in the still air . Watching it , she thought that of all the arts this was the one which showed the greatest contrast between the raw materials and the finished work . Words , pigments , notes of music  --  all of these , unmarshalled , possessed a certain beauty of their own ; a block of marble had at least an imaginable relationship with the statue which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clem 's materials , did not seem impossibly remote from the houses which he would make of them . But this fiery architecture , these fragments of luminous music , these bright , dreamlike , and impermanent pictures in the sky  --  what had they to do withnitre , sulphur and charcoal , with gummed paper , cotton-wick , and a handful of mineral salts ? The show was nearly over . Vin and his father were letting off the last few rockets . Their faces , occasionally lit up , were absorbed , triumphant , serene . Judy was shivering with cold and excitement . Toby , his feet sticking out over the edge of the seat , was completely immobile , but whether from profound emotion or too many coats it was impossible to tell . As for Mrs. Miniver , she was having a race with time . Some half-remembered words had been haunting her all the evening , a line of poetry , perhaps , or an old saying , something about brightness , somethingexquisitely appropriate . " Brightness ... " What was it ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhythm of it ; and she knew that she must remember it before the fireworks were finished , or it would be no use . The final rocket went up , a really large one , a piece of reckless extravagance . Its sibilant uprushwas impressive , dragonlike ; it soared twice as high as any they had had before ; and the moment it had burst , Mrs. Miniver remembered . The Eve of the ShootMrs . Miniver " Brightness falls from the air "  --  that was it ! The sparks from the rocket came pouring down the sky in a slow golden cascade , vanishing one by one into a lake of darkness . Beauty is but a flowerWhich wrinkles will devour ; Brightness falls from the air ; Queens have died young and fair ; Dust bath closed Helen 's eyeIt was quite irrelevant , really , a lament by Nashe in time of pestilence , nothing to do with fireworksat all . But she knew that it was just what she had needed to round off the scene for her and to make its memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood , the only sure weapon against oblivion. 24dBTHE EVE OF THE SHOOTEVERY year without fail Mrs. Miniver received an invitation written in a sloping Victorian hand on lavishly stout cream-laid . The right-hand top corner was embossed in heavy black Gothic with the address " Chervil Court , Crampton . " On the left were three tiny formalized sketches  --  a telegraph-pole , an upright telephone , and a railway engine of the Stephenson period , stocky and high-funnelled  --  followed respectively by the words , " Great Yettingford , " " Buntisley 3 , " and " Slape Junction . " The letter began with old Lady Chervil 's unvarying formula : My dear Mrs. Miniver , Chervil and I shall be delighted if you and your Husband will stay with us from Friday 19th to Mondayzznd November . ( She would have gone to the guillotine sooner than use the expression " week-end . " ) 27Mrs . Miniver Mrs. Miniver tossed the letter over to Clem . There must , he remarked , be an air-port near there by now , and sketched in under the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wing , followed by the words , " Market Bumbleton . " There was no need for them to discuss whether they were going to accept the invitation . They always went to Chervil . The shooting was excellent , the food beyond praise ; and it was soothing , for a short time , to slow oneself down to the pace of its old- fashioned ritual , and to spend three days in in- verted commas . " And what , " said the Colonel , turning to Mrs. Miniver at dinner on the night of their arrival , " is your opinion . . . ? " She had been afraid of this ever since , over the vol-au-vent , that woman in the wrong shade of green , on being asked whether she was coming out with the guns tomorrow , had shut her eyes and ever so delicately shuddered : thus plunging everybody around her into what was bound in that company to be a tedious and unprofitable 28 29The Eve of the Shootdiscussion . Tedious because neither side possessedany currency but cliches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side was going to budge an inch . Besides , what a hare to start at a shooting-party ! You might with as much sense and propriety get up at a Lord Mayor 's banquet and give a harangue on vegetarianism . If you felt as strongly as that , the only thing to do was to have ' flu and stay away . It raged , if such a stale controversy could be said to rage , all through the quail , the ice-pudding , and the mushrooms on toast . Well-worn coins rang in Mrs. Miniver 's ears . " After all , the birds get a sportin ' chance . . . . " " Animals may not have souls , but still . . . " " Now take huntin ' . . . " " Oh , bull-fightin '  --  that 's quite a different kettle of fish . . . . " Italics bred italics . Dropped g 's fell as thick as confetti . Sooner or later the tide of argument was almost certain to reach her end of the table , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . She had been through it all too many times before , and even in circles where one could speak freely the subject had become too hackneyed to be borne . Mrs. MiniverHer own attitude , she knew , was unethical but honest . She did not happen to be personally squeamish , which was merely a matter of chance . She enjoyed any display of skill ; she enjoyed bare trees , rimy pastures , breath made visible by frost , the smell of dead leaves , and the intricate detail of winter hedgerows ; above all , she enjoyed that element of woodcraft , that sense of " playing Indians , " which games fail to supply and which the detractors of hunting , shooting , and fishing so often mistake for bloodlust . And although she admitted that all shooting was cruel and that all cruelty was wrong , it seemed to her that to abolish shooting before you had abolished war was like flicking a speck of mud off the top of a midden . For the moment the conversation on either side of her had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace and silence . She had time to study the heraldic beauty of the pineapple ( for they had now reached dessert ) , to speculate on the second footman 's private life ( he had a studious , enigmatic face and probablyread philosophy ) , and to reflect how un-3  --  The Eve of the Shootpleasing , musically , is the sound of a pack of upper-class English voices in full cry . Lady Chervil , however , was a watchful and tidy-minded hostess of the old school , who regardeda dinner-party as a quadrille and disapprovedof islands . With a masterly verbal tweak she readjusted the guests who had got out of step . " And what , " said the Colonel , turning to Mrs. Miniver , " is your opinion of all these blood sports ? " " I think they are indefensible , but irresistible , " she answered . She had found through long experiencethat this remark usually closed the subjectpretty quickly . It left very little to be said . Besides , she meant it . " Ha ! " said the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha ! " This made avaluable addition to her collection . She hadlately acquired a " Humph ! " and two " Whews ! " but she was still waiting in vain for a " Pshaw ! " " Tell me , " she said , " were n't you with anuncle of mine in Singapore  --  Torquil Piggott ? " " Piggy ! " exclaimed the Colonel , beaminggratefully , and plunged into reminiscence . Thank31Mrs . MiniverGod for colonels , thought Mrs. Miniver ; sweet creatures , so easily entertained , so biddably divertedfrom senseless controversy into comfortablemonologue : there was nothing in the world so restful as a really good English colonel . She nailed her smile to the mast and reverted to the pineapple and the second footman . Clem caught her eye across the table . It seemed to her sometimesthat the most important thing about marriagewas not a home or children or a remedy against sin , but simply there being always an eye to catch . Christmas Shopping32CHRISTMAS SHOPPINGONE of the minor arts of life , thought Mrs. Miniver at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy in the matter of swing doors . With patience and skilfultiming it was very seldom necessary to use your strength on them . You could nearly always follow close behind some masterful person who had already done the pushing ; and if you were too late for that and the door had begun to swing towards you , then it was well worth pausingfor a second until it swung away again and needed only a gentle encouragement . This seemed obvious enough ; but there was an astounding number of people who seemed to glory in taking the line of most resistance , hurling themselves against an approaching door and reversingits direction by brute force , as though there were virtue in the act . They must lead , she reflected , very uncomfortable lives. 35Mrs . Miniver Christmas ShoppingPlacing herself neatly in the wake of a bullneckedwoman in tweeds , she slipped out of the shop . There was a raw wind ; sleety rain was beginning to fall , blurring the lamplight ; the pavements were seal-sleek ; it was settling down into one of those nasty wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbearablenostalgia . She tumbled all her parcels into the back of the car , slid , happy but exhausted , into the driving-seat , and set off for home . The double screen-wiper wagged companionably , uttering over and over again the same faint wheedling word , which she could never quite make out . It was a dissyllable , something like " receive " or " bequeath . " She was glad , at any rate , that they now had a screen-wiper which moved at a constantspeed . Their last had been one of those which work off the induction : lively and loquaciouswhen you are at a standstill , sulky and slow as soon as you get going and really need its help  --  like the very worst type of human being . She felt a little guilty : it was the first time she36had caught herself comparing the beloved old car unfavorably in any way with the usurping new one . Getting home was evidently going to be a long job . The usual six o'clock home-going stream was in spate with Christmas crowds , and Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , she had to admit , as she sat back and waited for the lights to change . Every year the same thing happened . At the beginning of November she made up her mind that this time , for once , she would get her Christmas shopping done early . She went as far as writing out a list  --  and there , for several weeks , the matter rested . At intervals she tried to pretend that Christmas Day fell on the 5th of December , or , alternatively , that all her friends and relations lived in South Africa and that she had to catch an early mail ; but it was no use . The feeling of temporal urgency can not be artificially produced , any more than the feeling of financial distress . The rich young man who determines to work his way round the world may gain many things , but the experience of poverty is not one37Mrs . Miniver of them . He knows that in the ultimate emer- gency he can always cable home for funds ; and Mrs. Miniver knew perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that all the people on her list lived in England . ( The screen-wiper wagged steadily . " Sea-green ... sea-green ... " Perhaps that was nearer the mark ? ) Besides , successful present-choosing depends very largely upon the right atmosphere , upon the contagious zest of crowds , upon sudden inspira- tions and perceptions , heightened rather than otherwise by a certain sense of pressure in space and time . To do it cold-bloodedly , in a half- empty shop , without any difficulty or competi- tion , is as joyless as a manage de convenance . So perhaps it was just as well , she told herself consolingly , that she had , as usual , left it till the middle of December . ( " Wee Free . . . Wee Free ... " Warmer . She 'd get it yet . ) The lights changed . She put the car into bottom gear , paused , then let in the clutch . It 38 Christmas Shoppingoccurred to her as she did so that it was not only people 's physical reactions to those three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Red , yellow , green  --  frustration , hope , joy : a brand-new conditioned reflex . Give it a few more years to get established , and psychiatristswould be using coloured rays , projected in that sequence , for the treatment of melancholia ; and to future generations green would no longer suggest envy , but freedom . In such haphazardways are symbolisms born and reborn . At the next crossing , red again . Frustrationbutsomehow one accepted it without resentment , simply because it was not imposed by a human hand . One could be annoyed with a policeman , but not with a tin hollyhock . The same was true of automatic telephones : ever since the dialling system had come in , the world 's output of irritation must have been halved . It was an argument for the mechanization of life which had not previously struck her . She got home at last . Clem was already in , with his legs stretched out in front of the fire. 39Mrs . Miniver " Successful ? " he asked , seeing her festooned with parcels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that screen-wiper  --  I think what it says is Beef Tea . ' " " My goodness , " said Clem . " I believe you 're right . " Three Stockings40THREE STOCKINGSHOWEVER much one groaned about it beforehand , however much one hated making arrangementsand doing up parcels and ordering several days ' meals in advance  --  when it actually happenedChristmas Day was always fun . It began in the same way every year : the handle of her bedroom door being turned just loudly enough to wake her up , but softly enough not to count as waking her up on purpose ; Toby glimmeringlike a moth in the dark doorway , clutching a nobbly Christmas stocking in one hand and holding up his pyjama trousers with the other . ( He insisted upon pyjamas , but he had not yet outgrown his sleeping-suit figure . ) " Toby ! It 's only just after six . I did say not till seven . " " But , Mummy , I ca n't tell the time . " He was43Mrs . Miniver Three Stockingsbarefoot and shivering , and his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you little goat . " He was into her bed in a flash , stocking and all . The tail of a clockwork dog scratched her shoulder . A few moments later another head appeared round the door , a little higher up . " Judy , darling , it 's too early , honestly . " " I know , but I heard Toby come in , so I knew you must be awake . " " All right , you can come into bed , but you 've got to keep quiet for a bit . Daddy 's still asleep . " And then a third head , higher up still , and Vin 's voice , even deeper than it had been at Long Leave . " I say , are the others in here ? I thought I heard them . " He curled himself up on the foot of his father 's bed . And by that time , of course , Clem was awake too . The old transparent stratagem had worked to perfection once more : there was nothing for it but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that Christmas Day had insidiously but definitely begun. 44The three right hands  --  Vin 's strong and broad , Judy 's thin and flexible , Toby 's still a star-fishplungedin and out of the three distorted stockings , until there was nothing left but the time-hallowed tangerine in the toe . ( It was curioushow that tradition lingered , even nowadays when children had a good supply of fruit all the year round . ) Their methods were as different as their hands . Vin , with little grunts of approval , examined each object carefully as he drew it out , exploring all its possibilities before he went on to the next . Judy , talking the whole time , pulled all her treasures out in a heap , took a quick glance at them and went straight for the one she liked best  --  a minikin black baby in a wicker cradle . Toby pulled all his out , too , but he arranged them in a neat pattern on the eiderdown and looked at them for a long time in complete silence . Then he picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirls inside  --  and put it by itself a little way off . After that he played with the other toys , appreciatively enough ; but from time to time his eyes would stray towards45Mrs . Miniverthe glass marble , as though to make sure it was still waiting for him . Mrs. Miniver watched him with a mixture of delight and misgiving . It was her own favourite approach to life : but the trouble was that sometimesthe marble rolled away . Judy 's was safer ; Vin 's , on the whole , the wisest of the three . To the banquet of real presents which was waiting downstairs , covered with a red and white dust-sheet , the stocking-toys , of course , were only an aperitif ; but they had a special and excitingquality of their own . Perhaps it was the atmosphere in which they were opened  --  the chill , the black window-panes , the unfamiliar hour ; perhaps it was the powerful charm of the miniature , of toy toys , of smallness squared ; perhaps it was the sense of limitation within a strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptier of a Christmas stocking something of the same enjoyment which is experienced by the writer and the reader of a sonnet ; or perhaps it was merely that the spell of the old legend still persisted , even though for everybody in the room except Toby the legend itself was outworn. 46Three StockingsThere were cross-currents of pleasure , too : smiling glances exchanged by her and Vin about the two younger children ( she remembered suddenly , having been an eldest child , the unsurpassablesense of grandeur that such glances gave one ) ; and by her and Clem , because they were both grown-ups ; and by her and Judy , because they were both women ; and by her and Toby , because they were both the kind that leaves the glass marble till the end . The room was laced with an invisible network of affectionate understanding . This was one of the moments , thought Mrs. Miniver , which paid off at a single stroke all the accumulations on the debit side of parenthood : the morning sickness and the quite astonishing pain ; the pram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook 's eye ; the holiday nurse who had been in the best families ; the pungent white mice , the shrivelled caterpillars ; the plasticine on the door-handles , the face-flannels in the bathroom , the nameless horrors down the crevices of armchairs ; the alarms and emergencies , the swallowed button , the inexplicable ear-47Mrs . Miniverache , the ominous rash appearing on the eve of a journey ; the school bills and the dentists ' bills ; the shortened step , the tempered pace , the emotionalcompromises , the divided loyalties , the adventures continually forsworn . And now Vin was eating his tangerine , pig by pig ; Judy had undressed the baby doll and was putting on its frock again back to front ; Toby was turning the glass marble round and round against the light , trying to count the squirls . There were sounds of movement in the house ; they were within measurable distance of the blessed chink of early morning tea . Mrs. Miniver looked towards the window . The dark sky had already paled a little in its frame of cherry-pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One had to frame it in something , to see it at all . The New Engagement Book48THE NEW ENGAGEMENTBOOKTWELFTH NIGHT was over ; the decorations were down ; Christmas ( which , like all extremes , dates easily ) seemed as demode as a hat in a passport photograph : and still Mrs. Miniver had not bought herself a new engagement book , but was scribbling untidy notes on the fly-leaf of the old one . As usual , she had meant to buy one before leaving London for Starlings ; but as usual , there had n't been time . It is a thing , she knew , which must never be done in a hurry . An engagement book is the most important of all those small adjuncts to life , that tribe of humble familiars which jog along beside one from year 's end to year 's end , apparently trivial , but momentous by reason of their terrible intimacy . A sponge , a comb , a tooth-brush , a spectacle-case , a foun-51Mrs . Minivertaro-pen  --  these are the things which need to be chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a part of one that they can scarcely be classed as inanimate . Insensitive , certainly  --  but so are one 's nails and hair . And although some of them can be given away if one takes a dislike to them , with others the only remedy is destruction ; and there is no case on record of anybody , however rich , being strong-minded enough to throw an almost new sponge into the fire . Meekly , one puts up with its inconvenient shape , its repulsive texture , and the cretinous face which is discernible among its contours when it is lightly squeezed . Eventually , thank goodness , it will wear out ; or with any luck one may leave it behind in an hotel . But an engagement book , once used , is a far worse problem . To give it away is impossible , to lose it is disastrous , and to scrap it and start a new one entails a laborious copying out of all the entries that have already been made . Unless , of course , one is prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk giving one 's biographers  --  ifany  --  the impression that one has52The New Engagement Booksuffered from a prolonged attack of leprosy . Or worse . So it was n't until well into January that Mrs. Miniver , up for the day from Starlings to go to the dentist , found herself in a stationer 's shop with enough leisure to give the matter the attentionit deserved . She stopped in front of the rack marked " Diaries " and prepared to enjoy herself . The first book she picked up was bound in scarlet morocco . Rather nice ; but it turned out to be one of those unnatural affairs which show two weeks at an opening . A fortnight , she always felt , was an impossible division of time , relevant neither to God 's arrangements nor to man 's . Days were the units which mattered most , being divided from each other by the astounding phenomenon of losing and regaining consciousness . ( How brave , how trustful people are , to dare to go to sleep ! ) But a day at an opening was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for a real diary . A week was what she wanted : a nice manageable chunk of time with a beginning , a middle , and an end , containing , 53Mrs . Miniverif desired , a space for each of the wonders of the world , the champions of Christendom , the deadly sins , or the colours of the rainbow . ( Mondaywas definitely yellow , Thursday a dull indigo , Friday violet . About the others she did n't feel so strongly . ) Of the week-at-an-opening kind , there were only three left . That was the worst of leaving it so late . One was bound in crimson leatherette , one in brown calf , and one in green lizard-skin . She rejected the leatherette at once . In a spasm of post-Christmas economy , she had once bought a very cheap engagement book , and it had annoyedher for twelve months ; everything she put down in it looked squalid . The green lizard , on the other hand , was marked seven-and-sixpence , which seemed a fabulous price to pay . She decided on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant little volume , an honest and sturdy companion for a year 's march . It would wear well ; she could not possibly , she knew , take a dislike to it . She paid , put it into her bag , left the shop and stepped on to a No. 11 bus . She54The New Engagement Bookwould catch the train back to Starlings with twenty minutes to spare . Half-way down the Pimlico Road she suddenly pressed the button and jumped off the bus . " Forgotten something , " she said , smiling apologetically at the conductor . There was no other bus in sight , so she walked back to Sloane Square as fast as she could . At this very moment , perhaps , the green lizard-skin diary was being bought by somebody else  --  some wholly unsuitableperson who merely wanted to get one in a hurry ; a rich , earnest woman who would fill it with committee meetings , or a business man who would not even glance at the binding when he opened it to jot down the words " Dine George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberly confined in brown calf , would be thinking about it in an agony of regret . But it was still there . She produced another threc-and-ninepence and bore it away delighted . After all , the difference was very little more than the price of a taxi . ( But she had to take a taxi to Charing Cross as well . ) In the train she pulled out the little green55Mrs . Minivershining book and entered in it , from memory , the few and simple appointments which the year had so far contained . " Meet Clem , 2.27 . " " Pikefishingwith Vin . " " Lunch Bucklands . " " Bridget for week-end . " Bare and laconic ; yet those first days had been crammed , like all other days , with feelings , ideas and discoveries . And so it would go on until the book was complete  --  a skeleton map of her year , which to anybody else 's eye would convey no picture whatever of her mental landscape . But she , glancing through it twelve months hence , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the details ; how , on the way out from the station , Clem had told her about the new Gloucestershire job ; how she and Vin had seen a heron ; how the Bucklands had given them home-cured gammon with pickled peaches ; and Bridget 's fascinating story about her cousin , the three-penny-bit , and the deaf chimney-sweep . The Last Day of the Holidays56THE LAST DAY OF THEHOLIDAYSTHE last day of the holidays dawned relentlessly wet . The last day down at Starlings , that is , which for Vin was what counted . Judy liked London equally well , and Toby lived in a landscape of his own ; but for Vin the twenty-four hours in Londonon his way back to school were only a kind of twilight , with one foot already in the grave . There was always some treat to mitigate it  --  the circus , a theatre , or a music-hall ; but even this , enjoyable as it was , had a tinge of the macabre in its glory , like the pomps and splendours of a funeral feast . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded , he found , as another life , to be approachedonly by way of the Styx . You died on the station platform , were reborn , not without pangs , in the train , and emerged at the other59Mrs . Miniver = The Last Day of the Holidaysend a different person , with a different language , a different outlook , and a different scale of values . That was what the stray grown-ups you met in the holidays did not seem to understand when they asked you the fatuous and invariable question , " How do you like school ? " It was impossible to answer this properly , because the person of whom they asked it never , strictly speaking , arrived at school at all . The reverse process  --  getting back into his home skin  --  though not in the least painful , was almost as difficult . For one thing , he had always outgrown it a little , and , like his home clothes , it had to be adjusted . Sometimes , before it was a comfortable fit , nearly a week had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark  --  that significant water-shed beyond which the days raced downhill in a heartless torrent . However full the children packed them , howeverearly they got up , however late , by various ruses , they contrived to go to bed , the holidays were always far too short . There was never time to carry out more than three-quarters of the plans they made . Some of these  --  such as build-6oing a tree-hut or exploring the mill-stream to its source  --  never got started at all ; others they had to leave half done , such as the cardboard castle which had been lurking for two years in a corner of the boxroom , roofless , but with a practicable portcullis . Somehow it never seemed possible to finish things like that during the next holidays . There was always some newer craze . This time their main occupation had been fitting up one of the outhouses like the cabin of a ship , with built-in bunks , straw palliasses , and a locker full of imaginary charts . ( Vin drew the charts , Judy painted them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had also made a brick-kiln in the kitchen garden and baked in it at least a dozen quite satisfactory bricks . Not enough to build anything with , it is true , but enough to give them a reassuring feeling that if they were ever wrecked on a desert island they would soon be able to run up a house or two : alwaysprovided , of course , that the island had a clay soil . And they had dammed the stream , and undammed it again ; and watched the woodmen cutting and splitting young chestnuts for palings ; 61Mrs . Miniver and watched the blacksmith , and the wheel- wright , and the man who came to mend the roof ; and walked over to Loddenden to have tea with Old Jane ; and had a bonfire , the day Vin caught a bream , so that they could cook it in the embers , wrapped in wet paper . For the last day they had made at least six different plans , but they were all out-of-door ones and it was obvious that they would all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like an old tarpaulin . A big cross-channel plane was labouring unsteadily southward against the gale , flying so low that it looked as though it would barely clear the chimneys . Below the high wooded ridge on which their house stood the green and silver network of the Marsh lay blurred with rain , its dykes swollen and many of its pastures already merged in flood . It had evidently got to be an indoor day . And because it was the last one they took turns , in order of age , at choosing what to do . Clem , who came first , chose darts ; they played Round the Clock , and Nannie , as usual , won , Mrs. Miniver chose Letter Bags ( a game which is to all other 62 The Last Day of the Holidaysletter-games as dry-fly fishing is to a string and a bent pin ) . Nannie , most popularly , chose toffee-making on the nursery fire ; and by the time that was set aside in biscuit-tin lids to cool , lunch was ready . Afterwards they took another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wind , no longer squally , had risen to a steady roar . The trees were straining , the lawn sodden , the Marsh completely blotted out . Vin chose charades , and Judy said she had been going to choose dressing up , so they combined the two ; and that , of course , lasted them easily till tea-time . Next it was Toby 's turn . But all he wanted apparently , and he wanted it with a consuming urgency , was to be left alone in a corner with eight elastic bands and an old photograph frame : he said he had had a good idea at tea . So the rest of them had a concert , with Clem at the piano . They sang " Camptown Races " and " The Ash Grove " and " Rolling Down to Rio " and " Alfonso Spagoni " and " Cockles and Mussels " and " A Bicycle Made for Two . " They were going to sing " Home , Sweet Home , " but Vin sug-63Mrs . Minivergested that it ought to be pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and after that , because they were just in the right mood for silly jokes , they laughed too much to be able to sing it at all , so the concert came to an end . So far as they knew , Toby had been paying no attention . But when the noise of their own laughter had died away they became aware of a small reedy voice singing in the far corner , accompanied by a confused twangling sound . It was Toby , blissfully sweeping the strings of his good idea . " Carry me hume ' " ( he sang ) " to Old Virginny .... ' Tck ! That end band 's come loose again . " When the two younger ones had been taken off to bed , Vin went to the window and peered out at the dripping garden . The rain had stopped at last ; a few torn clouds were racing past in a clear moonlit sky . But it was too late now . The holidays were over . In Search of a Charwoman64IN SEARCH OF A CHAR-WOMANABOUT once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed , that it was about time they asked the Lane-Pontifexes to dinner . There was nothing really the matter with the Lane-Pontifexes . They were quite nice , intelligent , decent people ; she was personable , and he was well-informed : yet for some mysterious reason one 's heart sank . Their company , as Clem said , was a continual shutting of windows . They asked the Minivers to dinner about every two months ; it was impossible , without being churl ish , to get out of it more than three times running ; and eventually , of course , they had to be asked in return . This acquaintanceship had lasted , neither waxing nor waning , for nearly ten years , and there seemed to be no particular reason67Mrs . Miniver In Search of a Charwomanwhy it should ever come to an end . Clem said it was part of the white man 's burden . Undiluted Lane-Pontifex was not to be thought of , so they generally made it an excuse for asking as many people as their dining-room table would hold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing-up . On the morning of the dinner-party Mrs. Jackman sent a message to say that she could n't come after all , as her mother was queer . So Mrs. Miniver , fervently wishing that the queerness of Mrs. Jackman 's mother had not happened to coincide with the imminence of the LanePontifexes , set off in search of a substitute . She crossed the King 's Road , turned up Skelton Street ( which is not one of the streets that Chelsea shows to American visitors ) , and approached the towering red-brick jungle which is known as " the Buildings . " Among the branches of this forest , theoretically at any rate , desirable and efficient charwomen hang in ripe clusters for the plucking ; but the plucking is not so simple . The architectural style of the Buildings is Late Victorian Philanthropic . Each68clump is named after a different benefactor , and each block in each clump is distinguished by a large capital letter . Mrs. Miniver entered the maze by the nearest gateway and then hesitated . She had heard of Mrs. Burchett through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platt 's Dwellings ; but she had reckoned without the alphabetical factor . She tried No. 23 in D Block , which happened to be near at hand , and after that she tried No. 23 in Blocks E , F , and G. But either the inhabitants genuinely did not know Mrs. Burchett 's address , or else some esoteric code forbade them to reveal it . No. 23 was in every case on the fourth floor ; and as she climbed up the steep stone stairs of Block H Mrs. Miniver felt inclined , quite unfairly , to blame the whole business on to the LanePontifexes . This time , however , she was more successful . A large , neat , cheerful woman came to the door , with her hair piled up on the top of her head like a whipped cream walnut . Obviously a pearl among charwomen  --  a capable pearl . Yes , she was Mrs. Burchett . Yes , she had often worked69Mrs . Miniverfor Miss Ducane , and was glad that Miss Ducane had recommended her . Yes , she would certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To tell you the truth , " she added with gusto , " I was just wishing summing like this would turn up . Not that I need to do cleaning at present , really , Burchett and the boys all being in work . In fact , my son Len , ' e says I 've no business to go out to work at all , when there 's others wanting it more . But there  --  I do n't know whatever I should do if I did n't . Every now and then I just feel I 've got to ' ave a bit of a fling . " She tossed the whipped cream walnut so that it quivered . " Of course , charing . . . . I suppose it 's on'y like clearing up somebody else 's mess instead of your own , but it does make a change , and you do get a bit of company . Burchett , ' e says , You let ' er go , Len , and never mind the rights and wrongs . Coop ' er up too long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' e says , when your mother gets ' ipped there 's no peace for any of us till she 's worked it off summow . ' " She gave a large , good-humoured laugh . Mrs. Miniver liked her more and more , recognizing70In Search of a Charwomanin her that most endearing of qualities , an abundantzest for life . It was rare , that zest , and it bore no relation to age , class , creed , moral worth , or intellectual ability . It was an accidental gift , like blue eyes or a double-jointed thumb : impossible to acquire , and almost impossible , thank heaven , to lose . To be completely without it was the worst lack of all  --  and it dawned on her in a flash that that was what was the matter with the Lane-Pontifexes . " You 'll come at seven , then ? " " I sha n't be late , " said Mrs. Burchett , beamingreliably . It was evident that in spirit her sleeves were already rolled up . Threading her way back between the serried barrows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right  --  Burchett or Len . Economically , Len , of course . But psychologically , Burchett : for pent-up volcanoes can do almost as much harm in the world as empty purses . On the hall table there was a telephone message . Mr. and Mrs. Lane-Pontifex were extremely sorry , but they had both gone down71Mrs . Miniverwith ' flu . Mrs. Miniver 's heart gave a leap , and she immediately felt ashamed of herself . As an act of penitence she went out to the flower shop and sent the Lane-Pontifexes a big bunch of jonquils and a note . But nothing could undo the leap ; and as she walked home for the second time , she reflected what possibilities the evening now held ; how many lovely people there were from among whom they could fill the two empty places  --  people whom they really wanted to see , who were merry or wise or comforting or revealing , whose presence either heartened the spirit or kindled the mind ; people who opened windowsinstead of shutting them . And she reflected , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking away the number you first thought of . The First Day of Spring72THE FIRST DAY OF SPRINGIT was a Wedgwood day , with white clouds delicately modelled in relief against a sky of pale pure blue . The best of England , thought Mrs. Miniver , as opposed to countries with reasonable climates , is that it is not only once a year that you can say , " This is the first day of spring . " She had already said it twice since Christmas  --  once in January , when they had driven across the Marsh to the sea and it had been warm enough to lie on the sand without a coat ; and once in February , when she had taken the children for a lunch picnic in KensingtonGardens . The grass had been scattered with twigs from the previous night 's gale , and by the next afternoon it was snowing : but while it lasted that day had been part of the authentic currency of spring  --  a stray coin tossed down carelessly on account. 75Mrs . MiniverBut this time , she thought ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ) , it really was spring . On her way downstairs she paused in the drawing-room to look at the plane branches which she had picked up on the Embankment when the men were lopping the trees . She did this every year , but she could never quite believe her eyes when they actually burst into bud . It seemed impossible that those neat emerald bobbles , those velvety , milky-green leaves , should have been implicit in the sootblacksticks  --  so much deader-looking than the polished brown twigs of the countryside  --  which she had brought in a month ago . She bent closer to look at one of the newest leaves ( it was soft and half-spread , like a little pointed paw ) , got a cloud of yellow pollen from the flowers on to her nose , and went downstairs sneezing . Outside the air was delicious . She could feel it stroking her face as she moved through it , but there was no sensation of either warmth or chill . Walking towards Westminster ( she was going to meet Clem for lunch near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular76The First Day of Springtemperature so charming ; and decided that it was because , on a day like this , she came nearer than usual to losing her sense of separate identity . Extremes of heat and cold she enjoyed too , but it was with a tense , belligerent enjoyment . When they beat against the irregular frontiers of the skin , with all its weak angles and vulnerablesalients , they made her acutely conscious of her own boundaries in space . Here , she would find herself thinking , is where I end and the outside world begins . It was exciting , but divisive : it made for loneliness . But on certain days , and this was one of them , the barriers were down . She felt as though she and the outside world could mingle and interpenetrate ; as though she was not entirely contained in her own body but was part also of every other person in the street ; and , for that matter , of the thrush singing on a tree in Eaton Square , the roan drayhorsestraining to take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BuckinghamPalace Road . This was the real meaning of peace  --  not mere absence of division , but an active consciousness of unity , of being one of77Mrs . Miniverthe mountain-peak islands on a submerged continent . Just beyond the entrance to the royal stables she became aware that she was walking behind , and gradually overtaking , a small , ragged boy . He was about Toby 's size , but probably older . His shorts , even though they had been hauled well up under his armpits , were still far too long for him , and they had a big cobbled patch on the seat ; his grey jersey was dirty , skimpy , and threadbare ; his legs were spindly , his hair mousecolouredand closely cropped . He was not an attractive urchin : but what caught her eye were his accoutrements . He wore a sword made out of two pieces of broken lath , hung round his middle with string ; his helmet was a brown paper bag with a pigeon 's feather stuck through it and " Brooks 's Stores " printed on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-made cardboardshield . His step was jaunty yet purposeful , as though he was setting off on some secret campaignin which he was confident of victory . ( There were dragons in St. James 's Park , sheThe First Day of Springknew , for those who needed them : she had lived near it herself as a child . ) By the time he reached the front gates of the Palace she had drawn almost level with him : she could see that the shield was roughly coloured with red chalk and tied to his arm with a bootlace . She was about to pass him when he caught sight of another urchin , similarly equipped , on the opposite pavement . It was evidently going to be a combined expedition . he gave a shrill yell of greeting and stepped off the kerb . " Look out ! " cried Mrs. Miniver , grabbing him by the shoulder . A taxi swerved with screaming brakes and avoided him by perhaps an inch . But the boy was unimpressed . " I 'm awright , " he protested impatiently ; shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Miniver watched him till he got safely over to the other side . Then she discovered that her knees were trembling and that she felt extremely sick . Behind her the sentries stamped and strode , met , turned , and parted , carrying out with beautifulprecision their antique ritual . Sentries and cardboard shields : parallel gestures , it seemed , Mrs. Miniverin a world of bombing planes and motor traffic . But perhaps the making of the gesture was what mattered . She pulled herself together and walked on . The water , a bright translucent curve , flowedsteadily into the marble basin ; the tritons , nereids , and dolphins gambolled along the frieze ; the symbolic bronze statues held , a trifle sententiously , their heroic poses ; and high above them all the gilt Queen sat calmly in the sun . On Hampstead HeathON HAMPSTEAD HEATHTHEY went away nearly every week-end , either to Starlings or to other people 's houses , but about once a month they made a point of staying in London . On Saturday afternoon they would drive down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger children would take it in turns to choose a treat . This time it was Toby 's turn , and he chose Hampstead Heath because he wanted to sail his boat on the pond . Judy was n't particularly keen on boats , but her favourite doll Christabel had a new spring coat and she was quite glad of a chance to take her out in it . It was a clear , clean , nonchalant kind of day , with a billowy south wind . The scene round the pond , as they burst upon it suddenly up the hill , would have made an admirable opening for a ballet  --  a kind of English Petrouchka or Beau Danube . The blue pond , the white sails , the83Mrs . Miniverchildren in their Sunday clothes , the strolling grown-ups , the gambolling dogs , the ice-cream men ( hatched out prematurely by the unseasonableheat ) tinkling slowly round on their boxtricycles  --  itall had an air of having been rehearsed up to a perfection of spontaneity . The choreography was excellent , the decor charming : it remained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the car Toby discovered that he had left the key of his motor-boat at home . It was much too late to go back , of course : there was nothing to be done except wait and see how he would take it . One never knew , when setting out to comfort Toby , whether to prepare first aid for a pinprick or a broken heart . He was not yet old enough to be able to grade his own misfortunes : it is one of the maturer accomplishments . Fortunately he was in a philosophicalmood . He just said : " Oh , well , we can watch the others , " and trotted off to the pond with Clem , his feet beating crotchets against his father 's minims . Mrs. Miniver found a deck-chair and sat84On Hampstead Heathdown in the sun . Judy walked about , carrying Christabel rather ostentatiously so that people could see her new coat . It was really magnificent  --  paleyellow tweed with a brown velvet collar and brown buttons . Watching her , Mrs. Miniver wondered whether the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , precious to their owners than the old china ones , whose expectation of life had been a matter of months . The old ones had had the agonizing charm of transience : the modern ones held the promise of a reliable and enduring companionship  --  you could make plans for their future , think out their next winter 's wardrobe . But it was a silly problem , after all . For love is no actuary : and a new-born baby was probably neither more , nor less , treasured three hundred years ago than it is now , in spite of all our statistics about infant mortality . The sun was getting quite hot . From where she sat Mrs. Miniver could see two street orators setting up their flimsy platforms and angling for an audience . Judging by their clothes and generaldemeanour she guessed that the one on the85Mrs . Miniverright was Left-wing and the one on the left Rightwing : but she was too far away to read the wordingon their notice boards , and when they began to speak nothing reached her except a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wireless . Seeing Clem and Toby leave the pond and walk over towards the speakers , she collected Judy and joined them . As soon as she got near she found that her guess had been wrong : the right-hand speaker was extreme Right and the left extreme Left . But how many of their audience , she wondered , would have noticed if they had got up behind the wrong placards by mistake ? It was hard to take in the sense of what the speakers were saying , so confusing was the double clamour . But one thing was certain , that the fabric of both speeches was shot through and through with the steely tinsel of war . " To combat the forces of tyranny . . . " one of them ranted . " To crush down the menace of revolution ... " mouthed the other just as glibly . " Is any sacrificetoo great . . . ? " " Which of us would not willingly lay down . . . ? " And now , from somewhere behind them , 86On Hampstead Heathcame the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raucous that it made itself heard even through the babel nearer at hand . It seemed only half human , and for a moment Mrs. Miniver had a sense of nightmare ; but as soon as she realized what it was she grabbed Clem by the arm . " Come on ! " she said . " There 's a Punch and Judy ! " Clem 's face lit up . He hoisted Toby on to his shoulder and they all four edged their way out of the crowd . The rest of the morning was pure bliss . For over an hour they stood , absorbed , while the immortal melodrama unfolded itself before their eyes . The proscenium was shabby , the propertiescrude , the puppets battered almost featurelessby the years of savage slapstick they had undergone : but the performance was superb . The baby yelled and was flung out of the window ; Judy scolded and was bludgeoned to death ; the beadle , the doctor , and the hangman tried in turn to perform their professional duties and were outrageously thwarted ; Punch , cunning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality , came out87Mrs . Minivertriumphant in the end . And all the children , their faces upturned in the sun like a bed of pink daisies , laughed and clapped and shouted with delight . " So what ? " said Mrs. Miniver at the end , to Clem . " So nothing , " said Clem , shrugging his shoulders . " It 's great art , that 's all . Come on , I 'm hungry . " A Country House Visit88A COUNTRY HOUSE VISITITHEY went to Cornwall for Easter , to stay with the Edward Havelocks . People who did n't know Mrs. Miniver very well , and even some of those who did , would have found it difficult to believe what a feeling of leaden oppression always came over her during the last few miles of the approach to a strange country house visit . If they were arriving in their own car she could comment on it half-jokingly to Clem , which helped to dispel it : but if , as now , they had come by train and been met at the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's neck in dumb dismay , or at the most make some cryptic reference to her state of mind .

The year was ancy , but far more often , thank heaven , by a older here : the oak-woods were rounded , cush , burst of music . No , it was n't shyness . It was iony and mustard-gold , the grass under the fruit more like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered with petals , the exchanging the freedom of her own self-imposed cottage gardens were little glowing squares of routine for the inescapable burden of somebody rich embroidery . It was being a lavishly lovely else 's . She must be prepared to adjust herself all spring , almost frightening in its perfection , as day to an alien tempo : to go out , to come in , though for some reason it was meant to be a to go to bed , to sit , to stride , to potter ( oh ! final performance . " Positively the last appear- worst of all , to potter ) , whenever her hostess ance on any stage . . . . " She suggested this to92 93Mrs . Miniver A Country House VisitClem , wondering whether by any chance it had struck him , too . " But that 's what I feel every spring , " said Clem unexpectedly . And I 've known him through seventeen of them , thought Mrs. Miniver , without knowing that . But it was quite natural really : she had long ago discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Clem , on the whole , they obscured them . This was perhaps just as well . For if they had both been equally explicit they might have been in danger of understandingeach other completely ; and a certain degree of un-understanding ( not mis- , but un- ) is the only possible sanctuary which one human being can offer to another in the midst of the devastatingintimacy of a happy marriage . She saw every relationship as a pair of intersectingcircles . The more they intersected , it would seem at first glance , the better the relationship ; but this is not so . Beyond a certain point the law of diminishing returns sets in , and there are n't enough private resources left on either side to enrich the life that is shared . Probably perfection is reached when the areaof the two outer crescents , added together , is exactly equal to that of the leaf-shaped piece in the middle . On paper there must be some neat mathematical formula for arriving at this : in life , none . She breathed surreptitiously on the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they hardly intersected at all  --  a mere moonlight infatuation which would soon peter out  --  so she added ears and whiskers and turned them into Siamese-twin cats . ( But would that count , she wondered , as being Siamese cats ? ) Then she met the chauffeur 's eye in the driving-mirror and hurriedly rubbed the whole thing out , pretending to peer at the view . " But it 's all right , " said Clem , pursuing his own train of thought . " She always decides to stage another come-back . " " Who ? Oh  --  spring . Yes . " But she could not respond with much gaiety , for they were actually turning in at the gates of Penzarron . This was the worst moment of all . There was no escape now . In four days ' time , she told herself , they would be on their way back to London , having probably made several new94 95Mrs . Miniverfriends : but somehow this was no comfort to her at all . At any rate , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really grand dressing-gown , the kind one always caught glimpses of , exquisitely laid out , through other women 's bedroom doors . The vision of it sustainedher all the way up the drive between the mountainous rhododendron combers which never quite broke on top of the car . And all of a sudden the ordeal was over , and they had arrived , and Leila Havelock was introducingthem to their fellow-guests ; and the tuning-knobswere turning , turning , in broad preliminaryarcs , ready for more delicate adjustment as soon as the first faint throbbing of music should beat upon the ear. 96Mrs . Downce1MRS . DOWNCETHE first week-end after the school holidays were over , the Minivers kept away from Starlings , so as to let Mrs. Downce give the house a thorough turning out . By the time they went down again it was well into May . A noticeable change had come over the countryside : it had lost the coltish uncertain grace of spring and taken on a more poised , though still virginal , loveliness . As soon as Mrs. Downce appeared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere which is common to lovers and housewives , that something was amiss . She was not sure which of the two possible types of bad weather the omens portended  --  the subjective ( or dudgeonly ) or the objective ( or catastrophic ) . On the whole , knowing that it could n't be anything to do with the children , 99Mrs . Minivershe hoped that it would turn out to be the latter . Burst water-mains were so much easier to deal with than injured feelings . But might n't it , after all , be something to do with the children ? There might have been a telephone message while they were on their way down " Is everything all right ? " she asked in a casual voice , pulling off her gloves . " Well , no , madam , I 'm afraid I could n't hardly say that . " Mrs. Downce paused ominously . " ( Oh , come on , you old fool , do n't keep me on tenterhooks like this  --  which of them is it ? Toby ? Judy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's happened ? " " Well , madam , there 's nothing what you could call happened , it 's just there 's a norrible smell . " Mrs. Miniver nearly laughed out loud with relief . " Smell ? Where ? " " Everywhere , madam . All over the back part of the house , that is . A norrible smell . " Mrs. Miniver crossed the hall , opened the xooMrs . Downcedoor which led to the kitchen premises , and shut it again very quickly . " Good heavens ! " she said . " It 's unspeakable . " Mrs. Downce 's face bore the triumphant look peculiar to those who , suspected of hyperbole , are found to have been employing meiosis . " Downce thinks it 's the drains . His mother died of typhoid . " Clem came in from putting away the car . " Look here , Clem , you ought to know  --  is this drains , or is n't it ? " " I 'm an architect , " said Clem , " not a sanitary inspector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord ! " He , too , shut the passage door , appalled . " Me and Downce have been sitting in the library , sir , and cooking on a spirit lamp . We thought you would n't mind . " " Of course not , " said Clem . " But why on earth did n't you get in a plumber ? " " We thought at first it might go off , " Mrs. Downce explained . " But when it got too bad we did ring up Mr. Bateman . But that 's three days ago now  --  he 's putting in a new bathroom up at the Hall , and you know what the trades-.oiMrs . Miniver men are like down here when they 're busy . In- dependent . They do n't care who gets typhoid . " She was a Cockney , but had married into Kent ; and the last twenty-five years had only strengthened her conviction that anywhere out- side London was virtually Central Africa . " Nobody 's going to get typhoid , " said Clem impatiently , striding over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Downce reminded him with melancholy relish . " You wo n't get nobody now till Monday . " " Come on , " said Mrs. Miniver , in whom curiosity had at last overcome squeamishness . " Let 's try and find out what it is . It may not be drains at all . It may be a dead rat under the floor . " " Bore like a dead sheep , " said Clem , as , hold- ing their noses , they proceeded down the kitchen passage . " Bore like a dead babboth , " said Mrs. Miniver . They tracked the smell past the kitchen , scul- lery , and larder , until they came to the small wash-place and cloakroom just inside the garden door , where it seemed to be at its worst . 102 Mrs. Downce " I suppose that beads it bust be draids , " said Mrs. Miniver . But Clem , after looking round suspiciously among the litter of waterproofs , walking-sticks , nets , rods , and golf-clubs , took down Vin 's fishing haversack from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said briefly . " Dab the boy . " They carried the haversack out into the garden and emptied it . Among the floats , leads , and other paraphernalia there were two tins . The first containedearthworms , the second lugworms , both in an indescribable state . " Really , " said Mrs. Miniver , " this is a bit much . Such waste , too , " she added . " I helped him dig those lugworms the day we went over to Dungeness . They took us nearly two hours to get . " Clem 's face was grim . He got a spade from the tool-shed and buried the bait very deep in the kitchen garden . Then he went indoors and wrote a letter to Vin . From the time it took , and the look of his shoulder-blades , Mrs. Miniver was afraid that for once in a way he was being over-stern ; but when he leant back in his chair1o3Mrs . Miniverto re-read the letter she saw that it was profusely illustrated down the margin with his own particularbrand of pin-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Mrs. Downce , as she brought in the tea , remarked amiably and with an air of discovery that boys would be boys . Mrs. Miniver breathed more freely . The trough of low pressure was already over : it was going to be a fine week-end . Married Couples104MARRIED COUPLES " WE might get the Danbys , " said Mrs. Miniver , looking through her address-book over early morning tea . Clem 's father had just sent them a salmon , and it seemed a good opportunity to ask a few people to dinner . " We-ell , " said Clem , " I 'd love to have Nigel , but I do n't feel like coping with Helen . She yatters . " " What about the Pritchards ? " " There again , " said Clem . " Only the other way round . It would be grand to see Sara again , but Clive 'll talk nothing but shop . It 's too hot for Clive . Look  --  I must go and shave . Call out if you get any other ideas . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . As she did so her eye fell on an article in the newspaper which Clem had just thrown aside . " Problems of107Mrs . MiniverMarriage , " ran the title . She glanced through the first paragraph . " I am not setting out to decry marriage . Nobody pretends that it is a perfect institution , but nobody has yet suggested a better one . At the worst it is seldom quite beyond repair : at the best it can be delightful . Most married people are neither more nor less happy than they would have been if they had remained single . They may not be able to go round the world on a tramp steamer : but there is not that start in the evening when the coal falls out of the grate . " Good of its kind , she thought ; written , at any rate , with more restraint and a lighter touch than most articles on that well-worn subject : though , like all the rest of them , it bristled with three-quarter truths . She would finish reading it later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself again to the address-book . The Frants ? The Palmers ? Really , it was lamentable , the unevenness of most married couples . Like those gramophone records with a superb tune on one side and a negligible fill-up1o8Married Coupleson the other which you had to take whether you wanted it or not . Only in this case you could not simply ignore the vapid backing , but were forced to play it through to the bitter end exactly the same number of times as the side which you treasured . How silly it was , this convention  --  relaxeda little nowadays but still surprisinglyobstinate  --  that you must not invite one half of a married couple to dinner without the other . Even when both were equally charming , she often wished she could ask them on different days . For in order that the game of dinner-table conversation may be played to its best advantage , it is essential that every player should have a free hand . He must be at liberty to assume disguises , to balance precariously in untenable positions , to sacrifice the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow the partner 's presence makes this difficult . She does not , if she is civilized , chip in with " No , darling , it was Tuesday " ; but she is apt to crumble the bread , and to have a look in her eye . The pronouns , of course , can be reversed , thought Mrs. Miniver hastily , remembering Clive and Sara. 109Mrs . Miniver " Any luck ? " said Clem , reappearing . " No , none whatever . All the couples we owe dinners to are hopelessly lopsided . " " I wish to goodness , " said Clem , " we were as brave as old Lady J. She simply asks all the nice halves to one party and all the boaks to another . " " I know . And as often as not she has a cold and cancels the boak party at the last minute . But anyway , old Lady J. 's a Character . You ca n't do that sort of thing unless you 're a Character . " " Oh , well , better ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I can talk to Sara , and Helen and Clive can go into a boakish huddle . " " All right , " said Mrs. Miniver , shutting up the address-book with relief . But why , oh , why , she wondered , do writers of articles on marriage always confine themselves to the difficulties which it presents to those who are actually involved in it , and never mention the problems which it raises for their friends ? To everybody except the protagonists , she thought for the thousandth time , marriage is nothing but a nuisance . A single person is a manageable entity , 110Married Coupleswhom you can either make friends with or leave alone . But half of a married couple is not exactly a whole human being : if the marriage is successfulit is something a little more than that ; if unsuccessful , a little less . In either case , a fresh complication is added to the already intricatebusiness of friendship : as Clem had once remarked , you might as well try to dance a tarantella with a Siamese twin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the phrase had stuck , and to avoid , so far as their friendships were concerned , turning into Siamese twins had been one of their private marriage vows . How well , she wondered , had they kept it ? Only their friends could judge : but even to have been aware of the danger was something. 111A Drive to ScotlandA DRIVE TO SCOTLANDALTHOUGH they had driven up to Scotland every summer for fifteen years , they still felt a little stab of excitement when they came to the signpost at the top of Finchley Road which pointed to the left and simply said " The North . " It made a kind of chapter-heading to their holiday . They always started at seven after an early breakfast and shared the driving between them , changing over every fifty miles or so . This year it had been Clem 's turn to take the wheel first , of which Mrs. Miniver was rather glad . It meant that during the dreary fiat expanse between Biggleswade and Stamford she would be pleasantlypreoccupied with driving , whereas she would be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of the next stretch , which lay along the eastern fringe of the Dukeries . It was an115Mrs . Miniver A Drive to Scotlandample , rolling , opulent beauty ; Georgian , somehow , with a suggestion of full-bottomed wigs and old port . A trifle oppressive to live with , perhaps : but , as a rich dark-green tapestry drawn smoothly and swiftly past one , very satisfying . At Retford they changed places again . This landed Mrs. Miniver with Doncaster , the only big town on the whole route ; but after that she had an easy drive across the Plain of York to Boroughbridge , where they stopped for lunch . The great point was that Clem now came in for Leeming Lane , a fast fifteen-mile stretch , as straight as an arrow , which he loved and could do justice to : while she herself could sit back , enjoying the speed but thankful that she was n't at the wheel . At Scotch Corner they swung off to the left towards Bowes ; and this , they always felt , was where " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For they were out of the plain at last and climbing up into a completely different country , a country of small steep tumbled fields , rough stone walls , crying sheep , 116skirling plover , and lonely farm-houses sheltered by clumps of sycamore . " This , " said Clem as they topped a rise , " is where we passed those gipsies two years ago . " " I know , " said Mrs. Miniver . " I was just thinking that . ' With the skewbald horse . " It was amazing , the number of little memory-flags with which , on their minds ' map , the road was studded . There were dozens of them now , and every year added a few more . There was one , for instance , near Colsterworth , where their first car ( a two-cylinder roller-skate with overhead valves and partially exposed viscera , very sweet and willing but extremely second-hand ) had dropped a push-rod ; which , after a long search , they had recovered from the gutter a quarter of a mile behind . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ( a meretricious black beast of an obscure continental make , the only really disloyal one they had ever owned ) had venomously run a big end , stranding them for fourteen hours at a tin garage by the roadside . It had rained nearly the whole day ; they had played countless games of piquet on the top of117Mrs . Minivera packing-case , and Clem had scored repique and capot twice running . There were flags , too , at all the places where they had ever stopped to picnic ; and one at the place where they had seen a particularly fine double rainbow ; and one at the place where , after rounding a sharp bend , they had come upon a man in a stationary car hurriedlyremoving his false black beard . An enigmaticflag , that , five years old . They had , of course , lurked in the next side-turning to let him pass , and then trailed him for miles ; but he took the Rotherham fork at Barnby Moor , so they never discovered whether what they had seen was the aftermath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were climbing steadily now ; and presentlythe bones of the earth began breaking through the grass in rocky scars and outcrops ; and higher still there were no fields at all , but only the bare moors . At the summit of the road , half-way between Bowes and Brough , they stopped , according to their invariable custom , , and got out to stretch , smoke , and enjoy the view . They were standing on the spine of Eng-118A Drive to Scotlandland , nearly fifteen hundred feet above the sea . Yorkshire lay behind , Westmorland in front ; Hunderthwaite Moor and Teesdale to the north of them , Stainmore Forest and Arkengarthdale to the south . The silence , after the monotonous hum of the car , was almost startling . The air was knife-keen and as fresh as lettuce . It seemed a far cry from the lush , matronly , full-blown landscape of the south through which they had set out that morning . Moving northward in space , thought Mrs. Miniver , they had moved backward in time ; reversed the irreversible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what analogous mental journey , she wondered , what deliberate pilgrimage of the heart , could one  --  but she did not pursue that metaphor : it would give her the slip , she felt , like the man with the false beard . Clem finished his cigarette and ground it out carefully with his heel : the grass was tinder-dry . They got into the car again , conscious that one of their most cherished flags was now stuck in more deeply than ever . Mrs. Miniver let the clutch in and set off on the long descent to119Mrs . MiniverAppleby . In the convex driving-mirror she could see , dwindling rapidly , the patch of road where they had stood ; and she wondered why it had never occurred to her before that you cannotsuccessfully navigate the future unless you keep always framed beside it a small clear image of the past. 120The Twelfth of AugustTHE TWELFTH OF AUGUST " WELL , " said Archie McQuern , knocking out his pipe on the lowest stone of the dyke and brushing a crumb of pastry off his kilt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hoisted himself out of the heather and blew his whistle . Bess , the young black pointer , leapt to her feet ; Duke and Reiver , the two liverand-whiteones , got to theirs more circumspectly , as befitted their age and experience . They all three stood looking up at him with their queer angular faces . It just shows , thought Mrs. Miniver , leaning back against the dyke and watching her brother-in-law , how careful one ought to be about what animals one gets mixed up with . Archie , tall , bony , and chestnutheaded , had been breeding pointers for twenty years and was now almost indistinguishable from Duke ; while Alison , his eldest daughter , who was123Mrs . Miniverblack-haired and who helped him to train them , was beginning to have a distinct look of Bess , especially about the eyes . Oh , well , there were worse things to look like : at any rate pointers had interesting faces , more intellectual and less sentimental than those of other gun-dogs . And she wondered , in passing , whether the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English might not be due less to heredity than to their being encouraged to keep rabbits in their impressionable youth . Change a nation 's pets and you might change its physiognomy : but she could not think , off-hand , of a nice prognathous substitute . " No , thank you , " she said , in answer to a question from her brother-in-law . " I do n't think I 'll walk the Laosgainn beats  --  I ' 11 stay here with Susan and join you again when you 're doing the Low Moor . " The morning had been enjoyable but strenuous . Archie never dreamed of driving until he had had at least a fortnight of the subtler sport of shooting over dogs , so that the Twelfth at Quern , for onlookers , was not a ladylike affairThe Twelfth of Augustof lolling in a grouse-butt with a well-powdered nose . It entailed a long and stiffish walk , sonic of it through very deep old heather . Mrs. Miniverloved it , especially now that she had Vin 's shooting to watch as well as Clem 's ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did the two steepest beats of all , above the hill loch . The guns trudged off up the lee side of the dyke . The van , loaded with empty luncheon . baskets and the morning 's bag , blundered away down the cart-track like a drunken bee . The two women moved over to a little grassy knoll shaded by rowan trees . The wind had dropped entirely ; it was as hot as one always forgets the Highlands can be . Ben Cailleach and the other high tops were shimmering . Below , they could see the grey roof of Quern House jutting out of its fir plantation , with a column of smoke going up from the kitchen chimney , as straight as a wand . Beyond lay the little strath dotted with haycocks , and beyond that again Judy and Toby and their two youngest cousins were busily dammingthe burn . It was good for them , thought124 125Mrs . MiniverMrs . Miniver , to be for a time part of a large family , with the greater complexity , but lower intensity , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hazy middle distance to the near , clear presence of Clem 's sister , who had planted her back firmly against one of the rowans and begun to knit . " Susan , " said Mrs. Miniver , " where did that knitting come from ? I swear you did n't have any on you a minute ago . I believe you materializebits of knitting out of thin air , the way conjurersdo with lighted cigarettes . " " No , " said Susan , " they grow out of my finger-tips , like a thread out of a spider . As a matter of fact my whole inside is made of wool . One gets like that , you know , living in the Highlands all the year round . " " The great thing about you , " said her sisterin-law , " is that you 've never let it spread from the neck up . " " Oh , well , " said Mrs. IcQuern elliptically , " there 's always Douglas and Foulis . " Mrs. Miniver lay down on her side to make126The Twelfth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her picture was a spray of whin in full bloom , upon which two chaffinches were swinging . Above them a pair of white butterflies were weaving quick flirtatious patterns in the air . It was idyllic  --  a Chinese painting on silk ; an exquisite , peaceful oasis in a day of organized death . " It 's all very well to talk like that , " she said . " But you know you would n't live anywhere else for the world . I believe you 're completely and utterly contented . " Susan chuckled . " Not always . Not when the cook breaks her leg on the eleventh of August . " " Oh , everybody has catastrophes . The only thing that matters is to be properly cast , so that you get the kind of catastrophes you can deal with . I think that 's what I meant , more than contented . You 're quite perfectly cast , Susan . " " Bah-hah , " said Susan . " So are you , for that matter . I 'd hate your sort of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Except for a holiday  --  yes . " 127Mrs . Miniver " In fact , " said Susan , " it 's just as important to marry the right life as the right person . " Well , no , thought Mrs. Miniver , not quite . But near enough for a hot day , after lunch . She shut her eyes , taking the Chinese picture with her inside the lids . " Listen ! " said Susan , presently . " I heard a shot . " Mrs. Miniver opened her eyes again for a moment . Eight white wings lay scattered on the grass under the gorsebush . The chaffinches were looking as though butterflies would n't melt in their mouths . It was too hot to work out the moral . She shut her eyes again and went to sleep . At the Gaines128AT THE GAMESTHEY all went over to the Crurie Games , though not all for the same reason . Archie McQuern went because he thought he ought to , and Susan went because Archie thought she ought to . The three Miniver children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair in the next field . Alison , the eldest , went because the Ardbennie party were sure to be there , and she knew that Jock Murray was home on leave . Miss Bates , the English holiday governess , who had never been in Scotland before , went because her great-grandmother 's name had been Gillespie , and the sound of pipe-music always made her feel pleasantly queer . Clem went because he would generally rather do things than not , and Mrs. Miniver went because for some obscure reason she liked watching HighlandGames . " I ca n't understand it , " said her sister-in-131Mrs . Miniver law . " I should n't have thought it was your line at all . Just look how you go on about cricket . " But the whole point was , Mrs. Miniver tried to explain , that the Games were n't cricket . In fact , they were n't games at all , but athletics . There was no team spirit about , and no holiness and winning of Waterloo , but only a lot of ordinary men , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault higher or throw a weight farther than any of the others for the sake of thirty or forty shillings in prize-money and a mention in the Crurie Herald . It might not be very heroic , but it was agreeably straightforward . And beautiful , too , she thought with a lift of pleasure as one of the vaulters soared smoothly upwards at the end of his banded pole , cleared an improbable height , and dropped to the ground as lightly as though he were falling through water . ( For some reason , pole-vaulting always gave the impression that it was being per- formed in slow-motion . ) He was a lean lantern- jawed man in a darned sweater and faded blue shorts . He straightened himself up , strolled back to the starting-pointand pulled on his trousersAI rile 1sd11teJthe next-but-one competitor was just taking his bff . They were all completely unconcerned . Miss Bates looked as though she was n't quite sure of her ground . " It must be dreadfully cold for them , poor things , " she said at last , taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of August . The occasional gleams of sun were as unconvincingas a forced smile , and most of the time a bitter little wind enfiladed the grand-stand , sending coat-collars up and hands into pockets . There was a burst of applause . An announcement boomed out from the four loud-speakers which clustered back to back like the florets of moschatel . Mrs. Miniver turned to her brother-inlaw . " What was that ? I missed it . " " Heavy hammer , " said Archie . " Willie Muir is going to try and break the ground record . He 's the local blacksmith . " Mrs. Miniver touched Miss Bates on the arm and pointed to the farther side of the field . Muir was a huge man . His chest muscles stood out through his thin singlet and his kilt was the size of a barrel . He stepped forward , rubbed his132 133Mrs . Miniverhands , stamped his toes into the ground to get a firm stance , and gripped the haft of the hammer . " Good gracious ! " said Miss Bates , appalled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoulders , slowly at first but with increasing speed . " Look , there are some people sitting quite close to him  --  supposing he let go at the wrong moment ? " Mrs. Miniver had often supposed this , with horrified fascination ; but it never seemed to happen . The hammer was whirling now at a great speed , and at last Muir swung right round with a kind of grunting groan , and twenty-two pounds of brute metal flew through the air , landing with a thump a few feet from the judges . Mrs. Miniver relaxed . There was a storm of applause . Two men measured the distance with a tape . It was announced as ninety-four feet  --  three inches longer than the ground record . The applause redoubled . " Well , " said Miss Bates , " I suppose that 's what they call tossing the caber . Or is it calker ? " " Caber , " said Mrs. Miniver . " No , that wasn'tAt the Gamesit , but you 'll see it in a minute , I expect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture which was framed by the heathertrimmedpillars of the grand-stand ( stuck here and there , incongruously enough , with dahlias ) . The competitors were just assembling for the 600 yards handicap , looking , as runners so often do before a race , like the criminal line-up in a gangster film  --  to be transformed by the starter 's pistol into Greek gods . In another corner of the field a pair of wrestlers were interlocked in one of the more intimate holds of the catch-as-catchcanstyle . Miss Bates looked away rather quickly . The quadruple loud-speaker was announcing that the lantern-jawed man had won the polevaultingwith a height of ten feet nine inches . In the far distance the steam organ of the roundaboutwas playing , sweetly and puffily , " My Lily of Laguna . " And on the wooden platform in front of the grand-stand two men in full Highlanddress were poised for a sword-dance . One of them was small and spare , with light eyes , like Alan Breck . IIe wore the striking black-andyellowof the MacLeods ; there was a sprig of juniper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miniverand taller . He was wearing a dark greenish tartan , and his lips were parted all the time in an almost imperceptible smile . The pipes struck up their sharp thrusting rhythm , drowning the faint noises of the fair- ground . The two men danced neatly and vigor- ously , with a passionate precision . Their pointed soft-shod feet twinkled unerringly between the crossed blades and scabbards , in and out and over and round , going through the old intricate ritual with which their forebears had woven them- selves a cloak of security on the eve of battle . But now , if toe touched steel , it would mean only the forfeiting of prize-money , not a chill in the heart at the certainty of impending death . The younger man , as nimble as a cat for all his height , was still smiling a little as he danced . The Alan Breck one was flashing like a wasp in his black-and-yellow . The music began to quicken intolerably for the final steps : and Mrs. Miniver saw the rest of it through a mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch a sword-dance through to the end without developing a great-grandmother called Gillespie. 136The Autumn FlitTHE AUTUMN FLIT " WHERE on earth is Vin ? " asked Mrs. Miniver . The car was standing at the door of Starlings , ready to take them all back to London . The luggage-boot was filled to overflowing with the well-known paraphernalia of a nursery flit : even Clem 's genius for stacking had been unable to make it look like anything but a cubist cornucopia . Clem was in the driving seat ; Nannie was at the back , with Toby on her knee and Judy sitting close up beside her to make room foi Vin . But Vin himself was nowhere to be seen . " Wretched boy , " said Clem amiably . " I told him what time we were starting . " " He went off on his bike directly after breakfast , " said Judy , " to fetch his knife . He left it over at Pound Mill yesterday when he was fishing . " " He may have come in through the garden139Mrs . Miniverdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might go and see if he 's in the kitchen , and I 'll try the nursery . " She went back into the house . It had already begun to acquire that out-at-grass , off-duty look which houses get as soon as their owners go away ; it was quite obviously preparing to take off its stays and slip into something loose . The day nursery was empty , but around it , like a line of salt wrack , lay unmistakable traces of the children . As they grew older the flotsam of the holidays , without diminishing in quantity , changed a little in character . There were fewer stones and pieces of wood , though Toby still collected flints with holes through them and sticks which had been spirally grooved by honeysuckle . On the other hand there were now things like empty cartridge-cases ( spent by Vin on rabbits and retrieved by Toby for use in a vast chess-Like game which he played , by himself , on the squares of the nursery linoleum ) ; and on the edge of the window-sill lay some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some broken feathers , and the clamp-marks of a small140The Autumn Flitvice . Vin , the evening before , had been tying flies ; having run out of proper materials , he had had to fall back on the contents of the toy-cupboard , and with great ingenuity he had produced something which looked at first sight like an Alexandra , but which was really , he admitted , a Red-Indian-and-Gollywog . Of Judy the traces were less conspicuous : her activities were mostly personal and required little gear . But just occasionally she too was bitten with the boys ' mania for making things , and when that happened she got it badly . A few days ago , someone had described in the " Children 's Hour " how to make a reed-pipe out of a jointed wheat-stalk , or , failing that , out of a drinking straw with a blob of sealing wax at one end . The farms immediately round Starlings were all pasture and hops : so she begged a packet of straws from Mrs. Downce and used up every one of them . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space the six finger-holes so as to get a sol-fa scale proved to be a matter of trial and error , exasperatingto herself and excruciating to her hearers. 141Mrs . Miniver The Autumn FlitShe cut her left hand and burnt her right one . The floor became littered with small square chips of straw : there was one now , lurking under the table . Every half-hour or so there would be heard a tentative tweedling cadence , full of quarter-tones and other exotic intervals ; then a sigh as she snipped off the unsuccessful part of the pipe and threw it away . ( The top half she thoughtfully preserved as a squeaker for Toby . ) Just before bed-time the next day she managed to produce a pipe on which , by overblowing a little on the la , she could give a recognizable rendering of " Drink to Me Only . " As it happened , that day had been for the grown-ups one of great tension and anxiety , with the threat of war hanging like a leaden nimbus in the air . And Mrs. Miniver had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , bent hour after hour over her delicate and absorbing task . International tempers might flame or cool ; the turning kaleidoscope of time might throw mankind 's little coloured scraps of belief into new patterns , new ideologies ; but142the length of the vibrating column of air which , in a tube of a given calibre , would produce C natural  --  that was one of the fixed things . And it was n't the fault of the scientists , was it , if the people for whom they made the pipes chose to play dangerous tunes ? She went back to the car , and at the same moment Vin appeared from the direction of the bicycle-shed , very much out of breath . " Sorry , " he said shortly , and scrambled into place beside Judy . Mrs. Miniver got in too . The car moved off through winding lanes towards the arterial road . It was certainly a heart-breaking day on which to leave the country . It was warm and yet fresh ; blindfold , one could have mistaken it for a morning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected , had a more poignant loveliness in autumn than in spring , because it was a recedingfootfall , a waning moon . The woods were just beginning to turn , the different trees springinginto individuality again , demobilized from the uniform green of summer . There had been a heavy dew . From the row of fires in front of143Mrs . Miniverthe hop-pickers ' hunts the smoke rose blue and pungent . The hops were nearly all in , the stripped bines lay tumbled and tangled on the ground . One campaign at least was over without bloodshed . Gas Masks144GAS MASKSCLEM had to go and get his gas mask early , on his way to the office , but the rest of them went at half-past one , hoping that the lunch hour would be less crowded . It may have been : but even so there was a longish queue . They were quite a large party  --  Mrs. Miniver and Nannie ; Judy and Toby ; Mrs. Adie , the Scots cook , lean as a winter aspen , and Gladys , the new houseparlourmaid : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or seven if you counted Toby 's Teddy.bear , which seldom left his side , and certainly not if there were any treats about . For to children , even more than to grown-ups ( and this is at once a consolation and a danger ) , any excitement really counts as a treat , even if it is a painful excitement like breaking your arm , or a horrible excitement like seeing a car smash , or a terrifying excitement like playing hide-and-seek147Mrs . Miniverin the shrubbery at dusk . Mrs. Miniver herself had been nearly grown-up in August 1914 , but she remembered vividly how her younger sister had exclaimed with shining eyes , " I say ! I 'm in a war ! " But she clung to the belief that this time , at any rate , children of Vin 's and Judy 's age had been told beforehand what it was all about , had heard both sides , and had discussed it themselves with a touching and astonishing maturity . If the worst came to the worst ( it was funny how one still shied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and fell back on euphemisms )  --  if the worst came to the worst , these children would at least know that we were fighting against an idea , and not against a nation . Whereas the last generation had been told to run and play in the garden , had been shut out from the grown-ups ' worried conclaves : and then quite suddenly had all been plunged into an orgy of licensed lunacy , of boycotting Grimm and Struwwelpeter , of looking askance at their cousins ' old Fraulein , and of feeling towards Dachshund puppies the uneasy tenderness of a devout churchwoman148Gas Masksdandling her daughter 's love-child . But this time those lunacies  --  or rather , the outlook which bred them  --  must not be allowed to come into being . To guard against that was the most important of all the forms of war work which she and other women would have to do : there are no tangible gas masks to defend us in wartimeagainst its slow , yellow , drifting corruption of the mind . The queue wormed itself on a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sunless corridors of the Town Hall . But at least there were benches to sit on . Judy produced pencils and paper ( she was a far-sighted child ) and began playing Consequences with Toby . By the time they edged up to the end of the corridor Mr. Chamberlain had met Shirley Temple in a Tube lift and Herr Hitler was closeted with Minnie Mouse in an even smaller rendezvous . ' When they got into the Town Hall itself they stopped playing . Less than half an hour later they came out again into the sunlit street : but Mrs. Miniver felt afterwards that during that149Mrs . Miniverhalf-hour she had said good-bye to something . To the last shreds which lingered in her , perhaps , of the old , false , traditional conception of glory . She carried away with her , as well as a litter of black rubber pigs , a series of detached impressions , like shots in a quick-cut film . Her own right hand with a pen in it , filling up six yellow cards in pleasurable block capitals ; Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fitter 's hands , betraying no signs of the apprehensionwhich Mrs. Miniver knew she must be feeling about her false fringe ; Gladys 's rueful giggle as her elaborate coiffure came out partially wrecked from the ordeal ; the look of sudden realization in Judy 's eyes just before her face was covered up ; the back of Toby 's neck , the valley deeper than usual because his muscles were taut with distaste ( he had a horror of rubber in any form ) ; a very small child bursting into a wail of dismay on catching sight of its mother disguised in a black snout ; the mother 's muffled reassurances  --  " It 's on'y Mum , duck . Look  --  it 's just a mask , like at Guy Fawkes , see ? " ( Mea mater mala sus est . Absurdly , she150Gas Masksremembered the Latin catch Vin had told her , which can mean either " My mother is a bad pig " or " Run , mother , the pig is eating the apples . " ) Finally , in another room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor like a growth of black fungus . They took what had been ordered for them  --  four medium size , two small  --  and filed out into the street . It was for this , thought Mrs. Miniver as they walked towards the car , that one had boiled the milk for their bottles , and washed their hands before lunch , and not let them eat with a spoon which had been dropped on the floor . Toby said suddenly , with a chuckle , " We ought to have got one for Teddy . " It would have been almost more bearable if he had said it seriously . But just as they were getting into the car a fat woman went past , with a fatter husband . " You did look a fright , " she said . " I ' ad to laugh . " One had to laugh. 151 " Back to Normal " " BACK TO NORMAL " "  --  AND a Welsh rabbit , " said Mrs. Miniver . " Vin 'll be spending the night here , and he likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? " " It 's nothing , madam , " said Mrs. Adie , fumblingin vain for a handkerchief and finally wipingher eyes on her apron . " It 's only , it 's so nice to be back to normal again . " A wintry smile reestablisheditself on her thin lips ; she went out of the room , sniffing . It was the first sign of emotion she had shown since the Crisis began . Back to normal . No , thought Mrs. Miniver , standing by the window and looking out into the square , they were n't quite back to normal , and never would be ; none of them , except perhapsToby . He was at an age when shapes , colours , and textures still meant more to him ( as they do to some people throughout life ) than human relationships . Therefore , his treasure155Mrs . Miniverwas safe : there would always be warm moss and pink shells and smooth chestnuts . But the rest of them  --  even , to a slight degree , Judy  --  would never be exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . Poorer by a few layers of security , by the sense of material permanence , by the conviction , when planting a bulb , that one would pretty certainly be there to see the daffodil in flower . But richer by several things , of which the most noticeable was a quickened eyesight . On the drive up from Starlings , a casual glimpse through the windowhad reminded her of De la Mare 's " Fare ' Well " : May the rusting harvest hedgerow Still the Traveller 's Joy entwine And as happy children gatherPosies once mine . And when things grew really serious  --  when Clem had gone off with his Anti-Aircraft Battery , and Vin had been sent up to Quern , and the children 's day school had been evacuated to the west country , and the maids had gone down to Starlings to prepare it for refugees , and156 " Back to Normal " she herself , staying at her sister 's flat , had signed on as an ambulance driver  --  during all the rather grim little bouts of staff-work which these arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next two lines of the same poem : Look thy last on all things lovely Every hour . .. . For even if none of them was killed or injured , and even if their house did not , after all , attract one of the high-explosive bombs intended for the near-by power station , yet these possibilities had been abruptly and urgently mooted : and they had found themselves looking at each other , and at their cherished possessions , with new eyes . Small objects one could send to the country  --  a picture or two , the second edition of Donne , and the little antelope made of burnt jade ; others , like the furniture , one could more or less replace : but one could n't send away , or replace , the old panelling on the stairs , or the one crooked pane in the dining-room window which made the area railings look bent , or the157Mrs . Minivernotches on the nursery door-post where they had measured the children every year . And these , among their material belongings , were the ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gained was an appreciation of the value of dulness . As a rule , one tended to long for more drama , to feel that the level stretches of life between its high peaks were a waste of time . Well , there had been enough drama lately . They had lived through seven years in as many days ; and Mrs. Miniver , at any rate , felt as though she had been wrung out and put through a mangle . She was tired to the marrow of her mind and heart , let alone her bones and ear-drums : and nothing in the world seemed more desirable than a long wet afternoon at a country vicarage with a rather boring aunt . A mountain range without valleys was merely a vast plateau , like the central part of Spain : and just about as exhausting to the nerves . The third and most important gain was a sudden clarifying of intentions . On one of the blackest evenings of all several of their friends158 " Back to Normal " had dropped in to listen to the news and exchangeplans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a young man called Flint , who wrote poetry and rather neat essays . When Mrs. Miniver switched off the set on a note of gloom they sat for a few moments too stunned to speak . Then Johnny Flint said : " I suppose that play of mine wo n't get written now . I 've been talking about it for years . Oh , God . Nothing but a slim vol. and a bunch of light middles . " And old Badger said in a tired growl from the depths of his armchair : " At least you 'll still be young , Johnny , if you come through it at all . But I wish I 'd left all the small stuff and concentrated on the I.P. experiments . " " I know , " said Mrs. Miniver . " I have n't got a pen like you , Johnny , or a laboratory like Badger . But there were a lot of things I wanted to do , too , that seemed fairly important . Only one never got around to them , somehow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly . " It 's caught us up this time all right . " 159Mrs . Miniver " Looks like it , " said Mrs. Miniver . " But if by any miraculous chance it has n't ... " Well , it had n't , after all . As she turned away from the window the date on her writing-table calendar caught her eye . Just a year ago , she remembered , she had stood at that same window putting the summer away and preparing to enjoy the autumn . And here she was again : only this time it was n't chrysanthemums she was rearranging , but values . Badger and the Echidna16oBADGER AND THEECHIDNAMRS . MINIVER left the committee meeting about four o'clock in a mood half-way between exasperation and despair . The subject ( a privatelyrun , rather Utopian scheme connected with slum clearance ) had fired her imagination when she had first heard of it : but why , she wondered , leaving the Comfreys ' ample portico behind her and crossing over into Regent 's Park , why must Pegasus always be harnessed to a dray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what mismanagement , what mistaking of bulk for importance , of bonhomie for goodwill , had a project like this been saddled with Lord Comfrey as chairman ? And how could it succeed , if the meetings were always to be held in that mosscarpetedmausoleum of a house , at that smug post-prandial hour ? If I had my way , she thought , walking very quickly so as to create a163Mrs . Miniverwind past her temples , I 'd arrange the scene of every conference to suit its subject : and this particular committee ought to meet in a damp basement bedroom in Shoreditch , sitting on upturnedsoap-boxes . Rats , blackbeetles , and all . She decided to go to the Zoo . It would be a relief to her feelings . As she passed the still open trenches she caught sight of old Badgecumbe standing among a little knot of sightseers , his vast head bent , his eyes hidden as usual beneath jutting , grizzled brows . " Badger ! You , rubber-necking ? " " I 've been working with pyridine all day , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. Not pyridine  --  people . I was just going to do a Whitman . Why not come too ? " Badger nodded towards the trenches . " Woolleyand the rest of ' em dig to uncover past civilizations . We dig to bury our own . " " I hear they 're going to roof them in and put flower-beds on top . " " Very suitable , " said Badger drily . " To remindus , I suppose , that this flower , safety , ' is still growing in pretty shallow soil . " 1 64Badger and the Echidna " Come mee-yer , Alf-ay ! " A woman standing at the foot of a gravel mountain beckoned with peevish urgency to her child . " You 'll fall in and break your neck , and serve you right . And besides , " she added , " you 'll get them new boots in a muck . " " I 'm the King of the Castle , ' " chanted the urchin from the topmost pinnacle . " I 'll give you Castle . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slitheredto the ground on the other side , and was bearing down upon some new sightseers with outstretched palm . " This wye to the trenches , lidy . Penny to show you round . ... " " I think perhaps you 're right , " said Badger , taking Mrs. Miniver 's arm . " It 'll be a relief to go and look at creatures who only behave grotesquelybecause they ca n't help it . " " Let 's choose the funniest , " said Mrs. Miniver . " The mandrills . And the giraffes . " They made their way towards the main entrance of the Zoo . " On second thoughts , " said Badger , " we'llX65Mrs . Miniver Badger and the Echidnago straight to the echidna . You know the echidna ? " " I 've seen its cage , but it 's never been actually on view . " " It would n't be . It 's nocturnal ; but we 'll get them to rout it out . It 's worth seeing , as a horrible warning . ZagIossus bruijnii . My unfavouriteof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I sometimes doubt . " There was no gainsaying Badger . Mrs. Miniver relinquished her hopes of the brilliant , sneeringmandrills , the gentle , bowing , improbable giraffes . But she liked the Small Rodent House , anyway . It contained three of the most engaginganimals in the Zoo  --  the Indian Fruit Bat , which was like a doll 's umbrella ; the Golden Hamster ; and , best of all , the Fat Sand Rat . But Badger marched her straight past these to the low cages at the end . The keeper opened the door of the sleeping-hutch ; and there , huddled in one corner , was what looked like a sack-shaped lump of clay about two feet long . On closer investigation , however , it proved to be covered with short , sparse , dirty-white166spines ; and between the spines there was some coarse greyish-brown hair . The keeper reached over and lifted it out of the hutch by one hind leg . ( " It 's the only way , " Badger explained . " There 's no other approach to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even less attractive than its top view . It had tiny pig 's eyes , squeezed tightly shut . Its face , almost nonexistent , was extended into a pipe-shaped snout , so long and thin that it looked far more like a tail than did the short spatulate appendage at the other end of its body . Through this snout , which it kept pressed down against its belly in a vain attempt to curl up , it emitted a prolonged , petulant hissing . As soon as the keeper put it down it hunched itself back into its corner again , squirming with distaste for light and activity . " Of course , " said Mrs. Miniver , trying to be fair , " I suppose it 's more lively at night . " " Not much , " said the keeper . " Waddles out just far enough to get its food , then back it goes . " ( " Habitat : West End , " murmured Badger . ) " Sucks it in through that snout . No teeth . " " Tell me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miniverhere for a good many years : have you ever managed to get up any affection for it ? " " Not much , " said the keeper , apologetically . " It 's just about alive , and that 's all you can say for it . " " Let 's get out of here , " said Badger abruptly . " It 's as bad as pyridine . Besides , that animal gives me the horrors . " " It 's certainly not pretty , " said Mrs. Miniver . " Pretty ? It 's criminal . It 's what 's been peoplinghalf the world . Lowest sub-class of mammal . Barely alive . The incarnation of accidie . " " Accidie ? Oh , yes  --  one of the seven deadly sins . " " The only deadly one , " said Badger . " Well , here we 've all been . Some of us less than others , but all of us to a certain extent . No vision . No energy . No discrimination . Spiritual monotremata . " Mrs. Miniver had often noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his words longer . They stepped out into the fresh autumn sunshine . A Wild Day168A WILD DAYLOOKING up casually in the middle of writing a letter , Mrs. Miniver saw , through the back window of the drawing-room , something that she had never consciously seen before : the last leaf being blown from a tree . One moment it was there , on the highest bough of all , waggingwildly in the wind and the rain . The next moment it was whirling away across the roof tops , a forlorn ragged speck . The line of its flight was the arabesque at the end of a chapter , the final scroll under the death-warrant of summer . Once more the lime-tree stood bone-naked . So that was that : and a good thing , too . At first , like most people , Mrs. Miniver had enjoyed the amazing spell of warm weather which had lasted throughout October and most of November . It had been pleasant and comforting ; it had helped to heal the scars which the last fortnight of September had left behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind-171Mrs . Miniver less , and night after night failed to bring any refreshing chill , she began to feel oddly uneasy . The year , now , seemed like an ageing woman whose smooth cheeks were the result , not of a heart perennially young , but of an assured in- come , a sound digestion , and a protective callous- ness of spirit . Out of those too-bright eyes there looked , now , not youthfulness , but infantilism ; and the smile which accompanied the look was growing a little vacant . Therefore , it had been a great relief when , a few days before , the weather had broken with a spectacular gale . The old beautiful painted aristocracy of the leaves , already tottering , had fallen in a night , overthrown by outward pres- sure and inward decadence . ' What remained were the essential masses of the tree , bare and sober , with a workaday beauty of their own . Through them , after a while , the sap would rise into a new aristocracy , which would flourish until it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no other way , it seems , in a deciduous world . True evergreenness does not exist : the word is only another term for the ability to overlap the old with the new . A Wild DayBy the time she had finished her letter ( which was a long one to Vin ) the rain had nearly stopped , though the gale was as strong as ever . She put on a mackintosh and struggled up the square to the pillar-box . Outside the little newsagent'sthe evening paper placards were flapping under their wire grids like netted geese . The lower half of one of them had been folded upwardsby the wind , hiding everything except the word " Jaws . " Mrs. Miniver was conscious of an instantaneous mental wincing , and an almost instantaneous remorse for it . However long the horror continued , one must not get to the stage of refusing to think about it . To shrink from direct pain was bad enough , but to shrink from vicarious pain was the ultimate cowardice . And whereas to conceal direct pain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only by feeling it to the utmost , and by expressing it , could the rest of the world help to heal the injury which had caused it . Money , food , clothing , shelter  --  people could give all these and still it would not be enough : it would not absolve them from the duty of paying in full , also , the imponderable tribute of grief. 172 173Mrs . MiniverShe turned down the next street towards the river . It was Nannie 's day out and she was going to fetch the children from school . The Royal Hospital , with bare straining trees in front of it and black flying clouds behind , stood sombrely magnificent , a fitting backcloth for the latest tragedy of the world . And here , perhaps , she thought as she battled along St. Leonard 's Terrace under the lee of the wall , was a clue to the uneasiness which she had felt at the lingering on of summer . All the associations of November , the traditional flotsam left upon its shore by the successive tides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind-month , the blood-month , Brumaire , the month of darkness : its sign was the evil scorpion , who , when surrounded by a ring of fire , was said to sting itself and die of its own poison . It was ushered in by the Vigil of Saman , Lord of Death , by the witches and warlocks of Hallowe'en . A later tide had left a later mark  --  the ritual bonfires of Guy Fawkes ' Day , round which children still stood in primitive excitement , their innocent eyes reflecting unconsciously the twin flames of sadism and fire-worship . This year , down atA Wild DayStarlings , the farmer 's children next door had made an extra large bonfire , and for the Guy 's face they had used a mask representing the wicked Queen out of Disney 's " Seven Dwarfs , " which Joey Iggulsden had bought at the village shop . This blend of two nursery ideologies , three hundred years apart , had particularly appealed to Clem . It showed , he said , that children had an inborn knowledge that evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vin said it only showed that Joey Iggulsden had a sense of humour . Anyway , it had been a grand bonfire , of a terrifying heat and redness . Mrs. Miniver had tried for a few moments to treat the scene as a reality , and had found herself wondering whether there was any cause or conviction in the world for which she would have the courage to go to the stake . She could think of several for which she would make the attempt : but , as the effigy lurched forward suddenly from the waist , with forked flames writhing out of its sleeves like burning fingers , and its painted leer crumpling up in the heat , she shuddered , and admitted humbly enough that she herself would probably recant at the crackling of the first twig. 174 175Mrs . MiniverHowever , nobody nowadays was burnt at the stake . The unfortunate ones of the world were subjected to a more lingering torment , and the fortunate ones were merely condemned to watch it from a front seat , unwilling tricoteuses at an execution they were powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn away their eyes ; for with such a picture stamped upon the retina of their memory they would not be able to lie easy until they had done their best to ensure that it could never happen again . But it was going to leave yet another ineffaceable watermarkon the bleak shores of November . When she reached the Embankment she met the full force of the gale , and exulted in it . Yes , this was the kind of weather that the events of the world called for : a wild , dark day , suitable for a wild , dark mood . From the two tall chimneysof the power station the smoke streamed out horizontally , a black banner and a white one . The river was at the three-quarter flood . It looked like a battlefield , water and wind meeting angrily in a thousand small hand-to-hand contests . But in an hour or so the tide would turn . New Year 's Eve176NEW YEAR 'S EVENEW YEAR 'S EVE was the only day of the year on which Mrs. Adie really unbent . Christmasshe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turkey and the mince-pies faithfully enough and took a benign interest in the children'spresents . Boxing Day made her , if anything , more tight-lipped than usual , for on that day the Minivers were in the habit of eating a " June dinner " as a respite from Christmas food : a practice which Mrs. Adie looked upon as unnaturaland faintly sacrilegious . There was a no-good-can-come-of-this expression on her face as she served up the clear soup , the fish mayonnaise , and the summer pudding ( made of bottled currants and raspberries ) ; but up till now nobody had so much as choked on a fish-bone . On New Year 's Eve , however , Mrs. Adie always invited the whole family into the kitchen179Mrs . Miniverfor a Hogmanay tea . There were scones and oatcakes and shortbread and rowan jelly ; and a Melrose sponge-cake sent down by her brother , and a Selkirk bannock sent down by her sister ; and in addition to all these she managed to provide a constant supply of fresh drop-scones all through the meal . She let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot griddle , and in watching each little sizzling yellow pool go beautifully brown round the edges . She even let Gladys make a few , on condition that she gave up her regrettable Sassenach habit of calling them " flapjacks . " After tea came an even greater treat  --  the fortune-telling . Clem and Vin pushed the table back , and they all settled down round the kitchen fire , while Mrs. Adie produced a large iron saucepan , seven bowls of cold water , and a box full of pieces of lead which she had somehow collected during the past twelve months from various sources , such as plumbers and roofmenders . ( At this time of year Vin always took care to lock up the cupboard in which his sea , 18oNew Year 's Evefishing tackle was kept : he was afraid that Mrs. Adie might have her eye on the weights . ) While the lead was still melting in the saucepanthe children were allowed to peer over it and watch . But to a safe distance . Then she arranged the seven bowls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of old leather gauntlets , lifted the pan off the fire , and poured a generous dollop of lead into each bowl . The noise it made as it entered the water was peculiar , and rather frightening  --  something between the crack of a pistol-shot and the hiss of an angry swan . Toby always blocked his ears and stood very close to Clem ; and Gladys , who was new to this ceremony , gave a shrill " Oo ! " and retreated into the scullery . " C 'm mout o ' there , " said Mrs. Adie contemptuously . " It 'll not hurt you . If you run from your lead you 'll run from your luck . " Obedient to the power of rhythm and alliteration , Gladys came back . Marvellous , thought Mrs. Miniver , the way almost any Scot , in181Mrs . Miniver almost any situation , can coin a phrase which has the authentic ring and cogency of an ancient proverb . And now Mrs. Adie knelt down on the hearth , took off her gloves , fished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to in- terpret them . The lead had hardened into the most fantastic shapes : shapes like groups of statuary , like fern-fronds , like intricate machin- ery , like outstretched wings , like gnarled olive- trees . To the uninitiated , they might have meant anything or nothing ; but Mrs. Adie  --  helped , it is true , by a pretty close knowledge of her hear- ers  --  contrived to give each of them a detailed and appropriate meaning . " My word now ! " she would say , speaking to Judy but at Clem , because it was easier that way , " look at all these fine new houses your daddy 's going to be architecting . And one of them 's got a terrible tall tower to it  --  ay , it 'll be a kirk he 's to build next , sure enough . " And then , to Vin : " Here 's you with a fishing-rod in your hand and a great big fish on the other end of it and a wheen more o ' them lying round about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be a grand year for the fishing , and no mistake . " And to Toby : " Now there 's two wee wheels in this one , as plain as plain . That 'll be that bicycle you 're wanting for your birthday , my lamb . . . . And whatever 's this I can see in yours , Nannie ? My lands ! I believe it 's a wedding-cake ! " " It 's no such thing , " said Nannie primly . " It 's a nice big new work-basket , that 's what it is . Just the thing I need , with the amount of stockingsthey all manage to wear out down here . " " Well , well , we 'll see , " said Mrs. Adie darkly . " Wedding-cake or work-basket , what will be will be , and one thing leads to another . " There she goes again , thought Mrs. Miniver with an inward chuckle . Rhythm and alliteration : the phrase-makers always get the last word . She herself was sitting in a big wicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn back a little because of the heat , and from where she sat , half in shadow , the scene looked wonderfully theatrical . Mrs. Adie , with a flush on her high cheek-bones and her usually neat hair quite dishevelled , was reaching forward toMrs . Miniverfish out Judy 's " fortune " ; and , opposite , the six fire-lit faces were awaiting , with varying degrees of credulity , her next pronouncement . It did n't much matter , after all , whether the fortunes came true , or whether anybody believed in them ; what mattered was that here at least was one small roomful of warmth and happiness , shut in by frail window-panes from a freezing , harsh , and inexplicable world . All one could do was to be thankful for moments like these . During the next twelve months , perhaps , the remaining odds and ends of their civilization would have been tipped into the melting-pot ; and not even Mrs. AdieBut she became aware that her own fortune had just been told out of the seventh bowl and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so much , Mrs. Adie , " she said with a smile , taking the cold , queer-shaped lump of metal on to her palm . So far as she could remember , it was almost exactly the same shape as the one she had had last year . So that was all right : for herself , she could think of nothing better . Choosing a Doll184CHOOSING A DOLL rIT was Judy 's birthday . For some reason , her presents this year included an unusually large proportion of money . There were several postal orders , a half-crown or two , a ten-shilling note from Clem 's father , and fourpence-halfpenny from Toby , who had brought her a purse as a present and thoughtfully put into it everything that he happened to have got left . Altogether it came to nearly thirty shillings , which was an unprecedented amount . Judy had long ago discovered that the chief problem about spending present-money was to choose between quality and quantity ; between the satisfaction of buying something really worth while , far beyond the scope of her weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armful of smaller parcels : so she had worked out a form of compromise which187Mrs . Minivershe called Crust and Crumb . This time she decided to lay out about fifteen shillings on Crust , in the shape of a new doll , and to spend the rest later on Crumb . So the day after her birthday she persuaded her mother to come on a shopping expedition . The choice of a doll , Judy found , was unexpectedlydifficult . They were things you did n't usually get a chance to choose for yourself : they arrived as presents , chosen for you by other people , and you had to get to know them and love them as they were . But when you saw rows and rows of them together it was almost impossible to be sure which you liked best . She explained this to her mother . " You see , it would be so awful to pick the wrong one . I mean , suppose you could have gone and bought me in a shop instead of just having me ; you might have made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth twitched . She could n't somehow imagine herself choosing Marigold Thompson . A nice child , but pudding-faced . " Well , " she said , " I like Marigold . " 188Choosing a Doll " Oh , so do I. But what I mean is , she would n't have done for you . And , what 's more , " pursued Judy , " Marigold 's mother would n't have done for me . At all , " she added with conviction . " Why do n't you like Marigold 's mother ? " asked Mrs. Miniver . " She 's always very kind to you . And she 's frightfully fond of children . " " Oh , I know . She told me so . But you see , when people are frightfully fond of children you never know whether they really like you or not , do you ? " Mrs. Miniver felt a quick glow of sympathy . It was exactly what she had so often thought about the boringness of the sort of man who " likes women . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a Thing about everything , if you know what I mean . " Mrs. Miniver knew only too well . She had been at school with Marigold 's mother . " And do you happen to know , " she asked , " what Marigold thinks of me ? " " Oh , she likes you , " said Judy . " She says you leave people alone . " 189Mrs . Miniver Choosing a DollMrs . Miniver cast her mind back , trying to remember whether she and her contemporaries had discussed one another 's parents so freely and with such perception . Not till much later , she felt sure  --  fourteen or fifteen , perhaps ; at Judy 's age one had more or less taken them for granted , comparing them only in degree of strictness . And to discuss them with one 's own parents would have been quite impossible : horizontal divisions were far stronger in those days than vertical ones . Perhaps the psychologists were right , and the " child mind "  --  that convenient abstraction  --  matured earlier nowadays . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of nine , and here was Judy , at eleven , buying a new one . One thing was certain : the ultra-modern dolls , with felt features realistically modelled , had no appeal for Judy at all . Mrs. Miniver , quite early in the expedition , had pointed one of them out . " Look , it 's exactly like a real child  --  is n't it lovely ? " " Oh , no ! " said Judy with unexpected vehe-190mence . " I do n't like it at all . You see , it 's not in the least like a real doll . " And she turned away again to the ringlets , the huge eyes , and the tiny rose-bud mouths . It was odd , thought her mother : dolls , which had begun by being crude imitations of men and women , had ended by developing a racial type of their own ; and now apparently they could not stray from this without becoming less lovable . Judy eventually managed to narrow her field of choice down to two  --  a blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but between these she was quite unable to decide . " Better toss up , " said her mother at last . They tossed with Toby 's halfpenny , and the blonde doll won . Judy stood staring at the two open boxes , her eyes round with surprise . " Mummy , how extraordinary ! I thought I liked them both exactly the same , but now I know for certain it 's the dark one I want . Have you ever noticed that about tossing up ? " " Often , " said Mrs. Miniver , smiling . She rememberedwith what astonishment , in her own191Mrs . Miniverchildhood , she had stumbled upon that particularpiece of knowledge ; and reflected once more how much of the fun of parenthood lay in watchingthe children remake , with delighted wonder , one 's own discoveries . At the Dentist's192AT THE DENTIST 'S " QUITE comfortable ? " asked Mr. Hinchley when he had played his usual little overture upon the various pedals and handles of his adjustable chair . " Quite , thank you , " said Mrs. Miniver . Horribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the refinement of civilized cruelty , this spick , span , and ingenious affair of shining leather and gleaming steel , which hoisted you and tilted you and fitted reassuringly into the small of your back and cupped your head tenderly between padded cushions . It ensured for you a more complete muscular relaxation than any armchair that you could buy for your own home : but it left your tormented nerves without even the solace of a counter-irritant . In the old days the victim 's attention had at least been distracted by an ache in the back , a crick in the neck , pins and needles in the legs , and the uneasy tickling195Mrs . Miniverof plush under the palm . But now , too efficiently suspended between heaven and earth , you were at liberty to concentrate on hell . " A lit-tle wi-der , " said Mr. Hinchley indulgently , dividing the words into separate syllables as though he were teaching a very small child to read . He was a kind , brisk , blond young man who smelt ( thank heaven ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned herself to the exquisitediscomfort of the electric drill . It was a pity , she felt , that this instrument had been inventedduring a period when scientific images in poetry were out of favour . To the moderns , who had been brought up with it , it was presumablyvieux jell . They took it for granted ; it did not fire their imagination like the pylons and the power-houses which were now the fashionable emotive symbols . But oh , what Donne could have made of it , if it had been invented in his time ! With what delight he would have seized upon it , with what harsh jostling and grinding of consonants he would have worked out metaphor after metaphor , comparing its action to that of all the worst196At the Dentist'stormentors of the heart : to jealousy , to remorse , to the sharp gnawing of a bad conscience and the squalid nagging of debt . " Are you quite all right ? " Mr. Hinchley inquired solicitously . " Eye aw eye , " said Mrs. Miniver . Oh , quite all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the way to spend a fine afternoon in early spring . For early spring it undoubtedly was , even though there might be a chunk of late winter still to come . Although they were not yet in bud , the bare trees outside Mr. Hinchley 's window had a quickened , bloomy look like the expression on the face of somebody who has just had a good idea but has not yet put it into words ; and the sky behind them was as clearly , flatly blue as the sky in an aunt 's water-colour . Mrs. Miniver kept her eyes focused as long as possible upon the far distance , hoping that they would take her other senses with them . But they did n't . The drill was too insistent . So presently she brought them back and cast a reproachful spaniel-glance upwards at Mr. Hinchley , which he was too much absorbed to see . She devoted the next few minutes to making a slow , dispas-197AMrs . Miniversionate study of his left eyebrow , which was a good enough shape as eyebrows go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love could make the human face tolerable at such close quarters . The far and the near having both failed her , she explored the middle distance : the embossed plaster patterns on the ceiling ; the round , white lamp  --  an albino moon  --  which hung between her and the window ; the X-ray machine ; the sterilizer ; the glass bowl on her left with the tumbler of pink mouth-wash beside it ; and on her right the large composite fitment , so absurdlylike a porcelain snowman , out of which burgeoned , among other things , this insufferable , this inescapable , this altogether abominable drill . " Do n't forget , " said Mr. Hinchley brightly , " you can always switch it off yourself if it gets unpleasant . " " Ank , " said Mrs. Miniver . Gets unpleasant . ... Understatement could be carried too far . She felt with her forefinger for the small cold knob on the right arm of the chair , which would , if she pressed it , silence the monster at once. 198At the Dentist'sThis , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in the case of jealousy and the other tormentors . But so far as Mrs. Miniver was concerned it might just as well not have been there , for she had never yet been able to bring herself to use it . Something always held her back  --  some vague blend of noble and ignoble motives , of pride and masochism and noblesse oblige and the Spartan Boy and Kate Barlass and a quite unreasonable feeling of hostility towards the white-veiled , white-coated young woman who hovered all the time behind Mr. Hinchley waiting for him to say " Double-ended spatula " or " Pink wax . " There was nothing whatever wrong with Miss Bligh , who was civil , decorative , and efficient : but somehow her presence made the use of the merciful switch a psychological impossibility . And now , at last , Mr. Hinchley turned off the drill of his own accord . " Finished ? " asked Mrs. Miniver with a hopeful , lopsided smile . " Afraid not . But I thought you 'd had about as much as you could do with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MiniverMiss Bligh , as though by prestidigitation , suddenly held a syringe between her scarlet finger-tips . She could just as easily , Mrs. Miniver felt , have produced a billiard ball , a white rabbit , or an ace-high straight flush . The prick of the injection was sharp , but its effect was magical . In an instant the left-hand side of her face ceased to belong to her . She put up one finger and stroked her cheek curiously . It was like stroking somebody else 's ; and therefore it was , tactually , like seeing herself clearly for the first time . Not in a mirror , where the eyes must always bear the double burden of looking and being looked into ; but from outside , through a window , catching herself in profile and unawares . Oh ! page John Donne , she thought again impatiently . Run , buttoned cherubim , through the palm lounges and gilt corridors of heaven , turning his name ( as is your habit ) into a falling , drawling dissyllable .

" Enchanted , she put the incident into her pocket for Clem . It jostled , a bright pebble , against several others : she had had a rewarding day . And Clem , who had driven down to the country to lunch with a client , would be pretty certain to come back with some good stuff , too . This was the cream of marriage , this nightly turningout of the day 's pocketful of memories , this deft habitual sharing of two pairs of eyes , two pairs of ears .

' " And then she could bring out Mary 's engagement , heard of by telephoneafter Clem had left the house ; and the joke which Toby had made on the way to school ; and , best of all , a beautiful saga about the woman who had sat next to her at lunch . Mrs. Miniver had not heard her name at all ; but if she had invented her she would have called her Burfish . Lady Constance Burfish , probably : or perhaps Mrs. Charles Burfish would be subtler . Anyway , it appeared that she lived in Gloucestershire : where did Mrs. Miniver live ? In London , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kent ? I-low nice , " said Mrs. Burfish . Her tone conveyed that Kent was not quite out of the top drawer . The talk turned , inevitably , on to the evacuationand billeting of children . Mrs. Miniver said204A Pocketful of Pebblesthey had offered to take six at Starlings , or more if the Government would provide enough beds to turn the oast-house playroom into a dormitory . " Wonderful of you , " said Mrs. Burfish . " But , you know , a small house is rather different . I mean , one does n't expect  --  does one ?  --  to keep up quite the same standards .... " Mrs. Miniver , whose standards of comfort , like Clem 's , were almost reprehensibly high , mentally compared the compact warmth of Star- lings with some of the bedrooms she had occu- pied in large country houses . But she said nothing : she did not want to interrupt what promised to be an enjoyable turn . " Of course , " went on Mrs. Burfish ( no , she would have to be Lady Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little woman they sent round . In fact , I felt quite sorry for her . I said : What an unpleasant job it must be for you , having to worm your way into people 's houses like this . ' But you know , she did n't seem to mind . I suppose some people are n't very sensitive . " " No , " said Mrs. Miniver , " I suppose not . " 205Mrs . Miniver " And I said to her quite plainly , If there 's a war you 'll find me only too willing to do my duty . But I can not see the point , ' I said , of tying oneself down publicly beforehand and upsetting the servants . ' " What luck I do have , thought Mrs. Miniver gratefully . She had , of course , read about this kind of thing in the papers , but a friend of hers who had helped with the billeting survey had assured her that it was mercifully rare . So that now , face to face  --  or rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was filled with the same sense of privileged awe which had overcome her when , emerging suddenly from a painful encounter with a juniper thicket in Teesdale , she had once seen a startled woodcockunmistakably carrying off its young betweenits feet . Looking , fascinated , at Lady Constance , she almost felt that she ought to write a letter to The Field . Moreover , Lady Constance seemed bent upon giving good measure . For she went on : " And , of course , I said to her before she left : Even if the worst does come to the worst , you2o6A Pocketful of Pebblesmust make it quite clear to the authorities that I can only accept Really Nice Children . ' " " And where , " Mrs. Miniver could not restrain herself from asking , " are the other ones to go ? " " There are sure to be camps , " said Lady Constance firmly . The talk swung in the opposite direction . A few minutes later Mrs. Miniver heard Lady Constance'sother neighbour , who bore one of the famous Norfolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . " Kent was avenged. 207BRAMBLES AND Ai PLE-TREES " THE worst of gardening , " said Mrs. Miniver , lying along one of the upper boughs of an appletreeand reaching out to snip with a satisfying crunch through a half-inch-thick bramble , " is that it 's so full of metaphors one hardly knows where to begin . " " I know , " said Clem from the ground below . He severed the root of the bramble with a billhookand began to haul it down hand over hand like a rope . " This is a prize one . It must have been about thirty feet long when it was whole . " They had just bought the tiny white weatherboardedcottage on the far side of Starlings Wood , which had been standing empty ever since old Parsloe , the hurdle-maker , had died there a year ago . For at least two years before that he had been almost bedridden , so that the211Mrs . Miniver Brambles and Apple-Treeslittle garden and orchard had become a wilderness . The Minivers had bought it partly becausethey were afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it first and spoil it , and partly because , having made Starlings as nearly perfect as they could , they were both filled with a restless longing for new material : a state of mind which is as natural in the sphere of house-property as it is in that of human relationships , but which those who do not share it are apt to mistake for inconstancy . Of this there was no question , for they both adored Starlings and would not have exchanged it for any other house in England : but just at the moment they were frankly enjoying a pretty shameless flirtation with old Parsloe 's cottage . When it was finished , as Clem said , they would probably marry it off to one of their friends ; in the meanwhile it was the making of the Easter holidays . They came over with the children nearly every day , working indoors when the weather was bad , and out of doors when it was fine : painting and whitewashing and carpenteringand digging and weeding and planting , with-212 213out too deeply inquiring why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potato-patch , close under the high-banked hedge which separated the garden from Carter 's Lane , there stood three appletrees . These , during the last few years , had been stealthily but steadily invaded by an army of brambles . Some had pressed downwards from the bank in a solid phalanx , smothering the hinder branches almost to death ; others had thrust upwards from the ground , looping themselvesover the topmost boughs and falling to take root again on the other side , so that the trees were bound to the earth with criss-cross cords , like haystacks on a windy headland . The job of rescuing them  --  combining as it did all the most attractive features of a crusade and a demolition contract  --  was one which the Miniversparticularly enjoyed . Constructive destructionis one of the most delightful employments in the world , and in civilized life the opportunitiesfor it are only too rare . Also , a bonfire is always fun ; and here was an excellent excuse for the children to keep one going all day and everyMrs . Miniver day , piling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( very unevenly ) in the intervals . As for Mrs. Miniver herself , she only regretted that circumstances had never be- fore led her to discover that the way to spend the spring was up an apple-tree , in daily intimacy with its bark , leaves , and buds . In early spring , as in the early years of children , there are times when the clock races , the film runs in swift motion , and the passionate watcher does not dare to glance away for fear he should miss some lovely and fleeting phase . The present week was one of those times . She looked , and the buds were as tightly , rosily clenched as a baby 's fist ; she looked again , and they were half uncurled . Tomorrow they would be nearly open ; the next day , perhaps , in full bloom , like those of the pear- tree on the other side of the garden , which tow- ered up in the sunlight as tall , rounded and dazzling as a cumulus cloud . " Time for beer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mrs. Miniver stuck her secateur into her belt and disposed herself more comfortably among Dramnies ana tipple-1 reesthe branches . She was determined not to come down to earth before she need ; if possible , never . Peering downwards through the young leaves , she could see Toby making an elaborate entanglementwith twigs and cotton over some newly sown grass . He trod on the seeds a good deal , because his soul was bent on getting the pattern of the network symmetrical . Vin and Judy were eating potatoes and racing snails up the gate-posts . In the field beyond , two lambs  --  the only living creatures which never fail to come up to expectation  --  were authentically gambolling . Their whiteness rivalled the pearblossom 's . The smoke of the bonfire drifted , blue and sweet , across the potato-patch . An invisible , indefatigable blackbird went on saying " Doh-mi ! " from somewhere on the other side of Carter 's Lane ; he had made this remark so many hundreds of times every day that they were all beginning to ignore it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment to take a critical look at what they had done . " We 've made a lot of difference today , " he214 215Mrs . Miniversaid , as he handed her glass up to her through the branches . " One is really beginning to see the shape of the trees . " " I suppose , " said Mrs. Miniver between gulps , " the brambles would try to make out that the apple-trees had been practising encirclement . " " That reminds me , " said Clem . " We ought to be getting home pretty soon if we do n't want to be late for the news . " The Khelim RugTHE KHELIM RUG " PROFESSOR BADGECUMBE has just telephoned to say that he is very sorry indeed , but he ca n't get back for another twenty minutes . " Behind his secretary 's air of apology crouched a protecting tigress , ready to spring if Mrs. Miniver showed the least sign of vexation . To Miss Perrin , Badger was a god , and luncheon guests whom he kept waiting had no right whateverto complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . " It does n't matter in the least , " said Mrs. Miniver , who rather agreed with her . " I 'm sure he must have been unavoidably detained . " " I 'm sure he must . " The tigress relaxed , mollified . Unavoidably detained my foot , thought Mrs. Miniver . He had probably been messing about in his laboratory and had simply forgotten the219Mrs . Miniver time ; or else he had been struck by a brilliant new idea in the Tube and had been carried on to the terminus . She knew this perfectly well , and so did Miss Perrin , and each knew that the other knew it . But they both loved Badger : so the Professor was unavoidably detained , and Mrs. Miniver sat down to wait in his study . As a matter of fact she was glad . She had been living for several weeks through one of those arid stretches of life which lie here and there between its more rewarding moments ; where there is neither nobility nor gaiety , neither civic splendour nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gasworks on one side and a row of dilapidated hoardings on the other . As a rule she managed to keep house- hold matters in what she considered their proper place . They should be no more , she felt , than a low unobtrusive humming in the background of consciousness : the mechanics of life should never be allowed to interfere with living . But every now and then some impish poltergeist seemed to throw a spanner into the works . Everything went wrong at once : chimneys 22o 221The Khelim Rugsmoked , pipes burst , vacuum-cleaners fused , china and glass fell to pieces , net curtains disintegratedin the wash . Nannie sprained her ankle , the cook got tonsilitis , the house-parlourmaidleft to be married , and the butterfly nut off the mincing-machine was nowhere to be found . At such times , she knew , you must just put on spiritual dungarees and remain in them until things are running smoothly again . Every morningyou awake to the kind of list which begins :  --  Sink-plug , Ruffle-tape . X-hooks . Glue . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry . Your horizon contracts , your mind 's eye is focused upon a small circle of exasperating detail . Sterility sets in ; the hatches of your mind are battened down . Your thoughts , once darling companions , turn into club bores , from which only sleep can bring release . When you are in this state , to be kept waiting for half an hour in somebody else 's house is nothing but the purest joy . At home the footstool limps , legless , thirstingfor its glue ; the curtain material lies virginallyunruffled ; the laundry , unconscious of your displeasure , dozes peacefully at Acton : Mrs. Miniverwhile you yourself are free . Yet you have not played truant : truancy has been thrust upon you , thanks to the fact that elderly professors so obligingly live up to their reputation for absentmindedness . She leant back in Badger 's armchair and prepared to let her mind stray wherever it liked . But it had got into spiritless habits , like a dog which has been kept on a lead , and for several minutes it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object it had grown accustomed to . There was a handle , it informed her , missing from Badger 's desk ; the bookcase had a cracked pane , and the glass finger-plate on the door was hanging by a single screw . Look here , said Mrs. Miniver , have n't I had enough of this sort of thing lately ? Run away and bring me something interesting . That 's what any decent mind ought to do for its owner when she lets it off the leash  --  just go bounding away into the long grass and bring back a really profound thought , laying it at her feet all furry and palpitating . C'm on , now . Hey los ' ! Her gaze wandered to the floor . The hearth-222The Khelim Rugrug was an old Khelim strip , threadbare but still glowing . Its border was made up of a row of small lozenges , joined by their acute angles . Beginning on the extreme left , she let her eye run idly along this row , naming the colours to herself as she came to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re  --  but here she was checked , for the second red was different from the first . So she had to begin again . Blue , purple , scarlet . Blue purple , crimson . Blue , purple , se  --  but here was yet a third red , which made the first one look almost orange . Blue , purple , flame , then . Blue , purple , crimson . Blue , purple , scarlet . . . . And this , it occurred to her , is one of the things that make life so difficult . The linked experiences of which it is composed appear to you one at a time ; it is therefore impossible to gauge their relative significance . In how much detail ought you to notice each one before it slips into the past ? Will " red " do , or must you cudgel your brains for a more exact description , hesitating between claret and magenta , vermilionand cardinal ? This grief , that joy , this interview , that relationship , this motor-smash , that223On the RiverCjMrs . Miniverpicnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assign to it a fixed position in your scale of memories , or will you sooner or later be forced to take it out again and reclassify it ? This dusty and tedious little patch of time  --  could she safely label it " drab " and have done with it , or would she find herself one day living through a period so relentlessly subfuse that this present lozenge would seem , by contrast , gay ? The door opened and Badger came in . His beard arrived first , his eyebrows next , then the rest of his vast yet twinkling bulk . " I 'm afraid I 'm a little late , " he said . It was five minutes past two. 224ON THE RIVER " WATER-RAT , " said Vin , jerking his head in the direction of the bank . His mother looked round just in time to see the bright eyes and sleek furry body before it disappeared behind a clump of reeds . " Oof ! " said Clem . " Let 's take it a bit easier . You 're in training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to Aunt Hefty 's by river . " " It 's only about a mile now , " said Vin , slackingoff a little . Mrs. Miniver , lying back and trailing one hand in the water , wondered what Vin thought of , consciously or subconsciously , when he said the word " mile . " Probably the stretch of road between the house and the village at his grandfather 's ; that was where they had spent most of their summer holidays when he was small , before they bought Starlings . " It 's just a mile to the post office , " somebody was certain to have said in his hearing : so that from then onwards , for the rest of his life , all his miles would be measured against that one . Judy's227Mrs . Miniverprivate mile , most likely , was the cart-track through the fields from Starlings to Brickwall Farm  --  her favourite walk . Toby 's might be this , too , eventually , but Toby was not yet mileconscious . He still measured his distances by true and not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long way off when you were tired and no distance at all when you were n't . It was the same with time . " Ten minutes , " for Mrs. Miniver herself , would always mean the length of the mid-morning break in her lessons with her first governess ; and " an hour " was the formal time after tea in her **25;6268;TOOLONG , in a clean frock and sash . Aunt Hetty was sitting in her summer-house at the water 's edge , knitting a sock and keeping a look-out for them . They moored the boat at her little landing-stage and stepped ashore . " My dears ! Lovely to see you , " said Aunt Hetty , rolling up her wool and impaling the ball on her needles as though she was skewering a piece of mutton to make a shashlik . " Come along  --  we 're having tea in the strawberry-bed . " " In the strawberry-bed ? " " Yes . It 's a new idea that occurred to me 228On the Riverlast time Vin was here . You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the plants ? Only the drawback is , there 's never any cream and sugar . So I thought , why not take the cream and sugar under the nets with us ? We tried it , and it 's a capital plan . I ca n't imagine why I never thought of it before . " She took Vin 's arm and led the way across the lawn . The others followed , exchanging telegraphically , with a smile , their amused affection for Aunt Hetty . Glorious woman : nobody else would have had an idea like that  --  or rather , nobody else would have put it seriously and efficientlyinto practice , complete with table , chairs , silver tea-pot , and cucumber sandwiches . She had even had the nets heightened on poles to give more head-room . When tea was over , Vin took Clem off to show him the place where he had hooked ( but lost ) a monster trout the week before . With any luck , he said , it might still be there . " Sure to be , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same one I used to see . They 're immortal , these Thames trout . " 229Mrs . MiniverMrs . Miniver and Aunt Hetty strolled down to the summer-house again . " My supply of great-nephews is running low , " said Aunt Hetty , unskewering the shashlik . " Margaret 's youngest boy leaves at the end of this half , and then I shall only have Vin . And when he leaves , I suppose there 'll be a two years ' gap before Toby comes . " " I 'm afraid so . Although from a financial point of view that 's rather a relief . " Aunt Hetty snorted . " From an aunt 's point of view it 's unpardonable . Between the lot of you , you ought to have arranged things better . What on earth d' you think I 'm here for , I should like to know ? " To be a pattern and example to all aunts , thought Mrs. Miniver ; to be a delight to boys and a comfort to their parents ; and to show that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raise the profession of auntship to a fine art , and make a point of having a house within the five-mile limit , preferablybetween Boveney and Queen 's Eyot . Aunt Hetty threw a piece of cake to a swan . She always brought some down after tea 230On the River " Not that I like swans , " she admitted . " But they 're one 's neighbours , and I think it 's best to keep in with them . " " I know . Conceited brutes . They always look as though they 'd just been reading their own fan-mail . " The others came back . They had seen the trout , and Clem swore that it had looked up and given him a leer of recognition . " We 'll have to be going , " said Vin regretfully . " There is n't a Queen 's Eyot Absence today , worse luck . " Looking back as they rounded the next bend of the river , they could see Aunt Hetty still waving good-bye to them , sock in hand , the sun glinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Mrs. Miniver as they moved smoothly downstream between the low green banks . In most parts of England this was the season of the year that she liked the least  --  this ripe , sultry time when the trees were no longer jade but malachite , and the hedges looked almost black against the pale parched fields . In the country round Starlings , especially , spring was the real apex of the year. 231Mrs . MiniverSummer was bathos , degringolade : one waited longingly for autumn , which would bring back colour and magic . But in this sort of landscape , high summer was the perfect time . Here , the grass of the water-meadows was fresh , cool , and green ; the steady onward sweep of the river , the quivering reflections in its depths and the play of light on its surface gave movement and variety , so that one felt none of that brooding stillness which mars July in unwatered countrysides . Even the rank and ramping vegetation of summer ( such a come-down , in most places , after the delicate miraculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like large jewellery on a fine , bold , handsome woman . Down by the water 's edge there were coarse clumps of comfrey and fig-wort , hemp agrimony and giant dock ; on the banks , a tangle of vetch and convolvulus , moon-daisies , yarrow , and bcdstraw ; while from higher up still came the heavy , heady sweetness of elder flowers . " Gosh ! " said Vin suddenly , after a spell of silence . " Long Leave 's the end of next week . This half seems to have gone most frightfully quick . " " Summer halves do , " said Clem . Left and Right232LEFT AND RIGHTTHE conversation at dinner had been so heated that by the end of it Mrs. Miniver had developed mental , moral , and physical indigestion . Teresa Frant , usually a brilliant mixer of unlikely human ingredients , had experimented for once a little too boldly . Or perhaps ( for one never knew with Teresa ) she had done it out of mischief . She had never had any use for her rich diehard sisterin-lawAgnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could have chosen a more effective , because less far-fetched , opponent than little Neish . For in addition to the personal antipathy which had struck almost visible sparks from their finger-tips at the moment of introduction , these two people were so irrevocably separated by race , class , age , sex , religion , politics , and cast of mind that it seemed absurd to classify them both as human beings . The Zoo authorities235Mrs . Miniverhad clearly put one or the other of them into the wrong cage . Therefore the argument which had sprung up between them during dinner had ended by being not so much a duel as a brawl : and while duels with food arc both entertaining and eupeptic , brawls are neither . It began by Lady Lingfield turning to Neish and saying through impalpable lorgnettes , " I hear you 're one of these Layba people : I 've always wondered what it feels like to be a Socialist . " To which Neish replied with savage dryness : " Mebbe ye 'd better j'st try it some time and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Mrs. Miniver ; from that moment on she resigned herself to a headache , and got it . Silly of Teresa . She herself , if Teresa had asked her to , could have battled with Agnes far more effectively , because from a closer range . But between a woman who thought that for her kitchenmaid to use face-powder was the beginning of Bolshevism , and a man who believed that the 3o-mile speed limit was the thin end of the Totalitarian wedge , there could be no useful interchange of ideas. 236Left and RightBesides , Mrs. Miniver was beginning to feel more than a little weary of exchanging ideas ( especially political ones ) and of hearing other people exchange theirs . It 's all very well , she reflected , when the ideas have had time to flower , or at least to bud , so that we can pick them judiciously , present them with a bow , and watch them unfold in the warmth of each other 's understanding : but there is far too much nowadaysof pulling up the wretched little things just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hand each other are nothing but up-ended rootlets , earthy and immature : left longer in the ground they might have come to something , but once they are exposed we seldom manage to replant them . It is largely the fault , no doubt , of the times we live in . Things happen too quickly , crisis follows crisis , the soil of our minds is perpetually disturbed . Each of us , to relieve his feelings , broadcasts his own running commentary on the preposterous and bewildering events of the hour : and this , nowadays , is what passes for conversation . For once in a way Mrs. Miniver felt glad when her hostess , 237Mrs . Miniverwith a scythe-like sweep of the eye , mowed down the women and carried them off ( unprotesting Sabines ) to the drawing-room . Agnes Lingfield , her very shoulder-blades expressing a sense of outrage , preceded the others up the stairs and retired at once , in rather marked silence , to powder her nose . " Teresa , you are very naughty . How could you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's a joke woman ; cross between a Wallis Mills and a Helen Hokinson . She 's got fatty degeneration of the soul . Do her a lot of good to be shaken up . " " Up to a point , yes . But not quite so violently as that . It 's probably made her think that everybody who is even faintly progressive is like Neish . And it 's certainly made him think that everybody who does n't belong to the extreme Left is like Agnes . I shall have to spend the rest of the evening trying to convince him that they are n't . " " Do , darling , " said Teresa impenitently . " That 'll be just your line . As a matter of fact , " she added , " I very much doubt whether people238Left and Rightlike Neish and Agnes ever think at all . They just feel . " " Oh , no , " said Mrs. Miniver . " They do both , I 'm certain . But the trouble is , they keep the two processes entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts or feel with their minds . " " That sounds grand , " said Teresa ironically ( they were old friends ) . " Does it mean anything , or were you just trying it out to see what it sounded like ? " " It either means nothing at all , " said Mrs. Miniver , " or else it 's the discovery of the century . I 'll think it over and let you know . " Agnes Lingfield came back into the room , her face more nearly matt but her eyes still gleaming . " Well , Teresa . I must say , your Left-wing friends ... " Oh , Lord , thought Mrs. Miniver , we 're off again ; and , anyway , I 'm sick and tired of being offered nothing but that same old choice . Left wing . . . Right wing . . . it 's so limited ; why does n't it ever occur to any of them that what one is really longing for is the wishbone ? 239 " DOING A MOLE " MRS . MINIVER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were going to stay with a school friend of Judy 's , decided to spend an hour in the neighbouring town before driving back to London . It was to this town that she had been sent for a fortnight every year as a small child , and she felt a sudden desire to do a Mole . ( " Doing a Mole " was Vin 's phrase  --  coined after reading The Wind in the Willows  --  for a revisitation of old haunts . ) Having parked the car , she walked along the front in the fresh dancing sunlight . This part of the town was almost unrecognizable  --  a street of angular lettering and neon strips , with ice-cream tricycles instead of the old painted hokey-pokey barrows . As for the children 's clothes  --  she tried to imagine what her old nurse would have said if she had wanted to walk from their lodgings to the beach in a wisp of a cotton sun-suit . She herself had worn no fewer than ten separate gar. 243 Mrs. Miniver ments , including woollen combinations ( folded thickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggy blue serge knickers into which all the rest of her clothes were tucked when she paddled , so that her shadow on the sand was always that of a gnome . Even in the sea she had worn blue serge , and on cold days a white Shetland spencer on top of her bathing-dress . She could still remember what it felt like when her nurse pulled it off over her wrists , wet . At the pier she stopped and leant over the rail- ings , hardly daring to draw a breath for fear of not finding what she was hoping for . She gave a cautious sniff , and then a luxurious one . It was all right . Evidently the most progressive of Town Councils could not do away with the peculiar , complex , deliciously nasty smell which is to be found under piers around high-water mark : a mixture of salt , rust , and slime , of rot- ting seaweed , dead limpets , and dried orange- peel . For a few moments , breathing it in , Mrs. Miniver could almost hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad back against the breakwater for the afternoon . But presently the sight of a concert-party " Doing a Mole " announcement brought her back again to the present day : for the name she read there was that of a sophisticated ensemble which she had often heard on the wireless . This was a far cry from the seaside entertainments of her childhood  --  the slightly shop-soiled-looking pierrots , and the Christy minstrels with straw hats , banjos , and bones . It was one of these , curiously enough , who had first introduced her to death . Ide sang a song which began : What 's ( plonk ! ) the use ( plonk ! ) of saving up your money , If you ca n't take it with you when you die ? ( plink-plonk ! ) and ended : But if ( plonk ! ) you 've got ( plonk ! ) a wart upon your nose , Well , you must take it with you when you die ( plink-plonk ! ) This , for some reason , pierced her to the heart with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself across her nurse 's grey tweed lap . " I do n't want to die ! " she sobbed . " Oh , Nannie , I do n't ever want to die ! " The nurse , 244 245Mrs . Miniverhorrified , picked her up and carried her out of the pavilion . " There , there , " she kept saying helplessly ; " there , there . " And that night she gave her a dose of magnesia . Just beyond the pier Mrs. Miniver turned up a steep , curved street with a church in it . This was where their lodgings had been . She had no idea of the number , but she felt certain she would know the house when she came to it . Here again her nose had a good memory , for a breath of sickly-sweet scent brought her to a sudden standstill . Of course : she had quite forgotten about the privet hedge . And with that memory came another : there had been four panes of coloured glass in the middle of the front door  --  green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn from the hall , you could make it be whatever season you liked in the front garden  --  spring , summer , autumn , or winter : but when you opened the door there was never anything but the hard white glare of July . She pushed the gate open and walked quietly up the path , to make sure whether those coloured panes were still there . They were : but as she bent down ( she had once stood on tiptoe ) to246247 " Doing a Mole " look at them , the door was opened by a woman with a shopping basket on her arm . " Oh ! " Mrs. Miniver tried to look selfpossessed . " I was just going to ring . I  --  I 'm looking for rooms . But if you 're going out , it does n't matter a bit . " " No trouble , " said the landlady . So Mrs. Miniver had to go through with it , peering into room after room . In the second floor front she paused and looked round very carefully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So big and airy . " But she was thinking , How low , how small ; how time contracts the rooms of one 's childhood , drawing the walls inwards and the ceilings down . What with the shrinkage and the redecoration ( for now , of course , it had a porridgy modern wallpaper with an orange frieze ) she would not have known it was the same room , if it had n't been for the fireplace . This , she was relieved to see , was untouched . There was the same ornate ironwork , the same rather bad imitation Dutch tiles ; and the lowest tile on the left was still loose . By wiggling it gently , she had discovered , you could slip this tile right out and put it back again ; and once , The New DimensionMrs . Miniveron their last day , she had dug a hole in the plaster behind it with her nurse 's nail-scissors and hidden a new farthing , in order to have some buried treasure to look for the next time they came .

" said the landlady . " That 's the bell . Excuse me a moment . " Mrs. Miniver made a bee-line for the fireplace , knelt down and wiggled gently . Her heart was thumping : she knew now what burglars must go through . The tile came out quite easily : the hole was still there , but the farthing was gone . She slipped the tile back , stood up , and managed to get her knees dusted just before the landlady reached the top of the stairs . Afterwards , walking down the steep street to - wards the beach , she thought about that farthing with an absurd and unreasonable pang . It would have made such a wonderful ending to her Mole . But she was comforted when she imagined with what incredulous delight some later child , exploring , must have found it. y48THE NEW DIMENSIONIT may or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was certainly seasicknessthat made Mrs. Miniver brave , so far as air travel was concerned . Though you can hardly claim to be brave , she told herself ashamedly as she fastened the safety-strap across her knees , if your inside feels like curds and whey and your mouth is as dry as pumice . Resignedwas a more suitable word for her state of mind . She had always had an exaggerated dread of the air : the reassuring statistics in the newspapers made no difference to her whatever . She was ready to admit that flying was safer than driving a car or crossing a crowded street ; but she was irrationally convinced that if she herself went up in an aeroplane it was perfectly certain to crash . If it be not safe for me , she said in effect , what care I how safe it be ? 251Mrs . MiniverAnd so far neither the enthusiasm of her airmindedcontemporaries , nor the calm assumptionby the younger generation that it was the only possible way to travel , had ever been able to tempt her into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that term automatically excludes anybody who is " a perfect sailor " ) , there are some sea journeys which can revolutionize all your feelings about death : and one of these is a crossing in bad weather from Kyle of Lochalsh to the Outer Isles . Mrs. Miniver had had the misfortune , ten days before , to coincide with a summer gale : and , crawling weakly ashore at Lochmaddy , she had sworn that nothing would induce her to cross the Little Minch again , unless the weather changed . The weather did change , of course . The wind dropped suddenly . For more than a week the days were hot and still , the water lapped gently , the narrow sickles of sand between the headlands shone white in the sunlight and whiter under the moon . The smaller islands looked like waterlilyleaves floating on a pool . The sea , all day , was blue ; but at sunset it was stained and streaked252The New Dimensionwith rose , crimson , and purple , as though some long-foundered ship with a cargo of wine had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she was due to leave , the wind rose as suddenly as it had fallen . It blew and rained hard all night , and although by next morning the sun was out again the sea was still heaving unattractively . Mrs. Miniver took one look at it and wired to Sollas Airport . It seemed to be the only thing to do ; unless indeed she was prepared to spend the rest of her life in the Hebrides , nostalgically beholding in dreams the King 's Road , Chelsea . Peering out of the small rhomboidal window of the plane , she wished , first , that some other passengers would come , to give her confidence ; and , second , that no other passengers would come , so that her poltroonery might be unobserved . For her face , she felt certain , must by now be noticeably green . It seemed as though her second wish at any rate was going to be granted , for there were only two minutes to go and she was still alone . But at the last moment a ramshackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an253Mrs . Miniverenormous farmer , followed by a young sheepdog , clambered into the plane . He turned at the door , shouted something in Gaelic to the woman who drove the cart , and lowered himselfgingerly into a seat which seemed far too frail to hold him . The dog , with vast unconcern , curled up on the floor and went to sleep . " I thought I would be loossing the plane , " observed the farmer pleasantly . " It wass my watch that wass fall-ty . " He tugged out an old silver turnip and adjusted it with care . " Do you often fly ? " asked Mrs. Miniver . He looked so marvellously incongruous . " Oh  --  yess . " He seemed mildly surprised at the question . " I have a brother in Barra . It iss very convenient . " His matter-of-factness was reassuring ; and she needed reassurance badly , for the plane was now lumbering forward over the rough grass of the landing-field . " This is my first flight , " she yelled above the noise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell somebody . " As a matter of fact , I 'm scared stiff . " She smiled , to pretend she was exaggerating ; but she knew that she254The New Dimensionwas n't . " I suppose , " she added , " I sha n't mind so much when it 's actually up . " " But it iss up , " said the farmer . And sure enough , looking out of the window , she saw that the incredible had happened . They were in the air . She could see the rocky headlands edged with a white frill of foam ; the deserted crofts , the drystonedykes , the green ridge-and-furrow of the lazy-beds whose only harvest nowadays was the wild iris ; and , as they gained height , the whole extraordinary pattern of North Uist , so netted and fretted with lochs that it looked like a piece of lace . Some hours later , in the train between Glasgowand Stirling , she tried to sort out her impressions . How hopelessly people fail , she thought , when they try to describe flying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the really important things . They tell you that it saves time and ( taking everything into account ) money ; they tell you that it makes the earth look like a map , cows like ants , and cars like beetles . But they do n't tell you that it is staggering , tremendous ; that it is not merely an experience but a re-birth ; that it255Mrs . Minivergives you for the first time in your life the freedomof a new dimension ( for although we know that there are three of them , we are forced to move mainly in two : so that our sense of upand-downnessis necessarily dim and undevelopedcompared with our acute perception of the to-and-fro ) . They do n't tell you that when you are up there it is the aeroplane that seems to be the safe solid core of things , while the earth is a distant planet upon which unfamiliar beings move among unthinkable dangers . They do n't tell you , either , that you will be torn all the time between an immense arrogance and an immensehumility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next a nameless sparrow . Nor do they tell you what it feels like to thread your way among the noble and exciting architecture of the clouds ; nor how  --  best of all  --  you may suddenly find a rainbow arched across the tip of your wing , as though you had caught it in passing and carried it along with you . If only they had told her these things , she would have flown long ago : for the promise of so much enchantment would have overcome fear . London in August256LONDON IN AUGUSTTHE woman at the far end of the Park seat kept on nervously twisting and untwisting her handkerchief as though in acute mental distress . She was muttering to herself , too , under her breath . Mrs. Miniver glanced at her sideways once or twice , wondering what was wrong and wishing there was something she could do about it ; but all of a sudden the woman , noticing her glances , looked up and smiled quite cheerfully . " It 's me First Aid , " she explained . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecturer , she says , Right over left , left over right , ' see ? But it never seems to come out the same , not when I do it meself . " " I wonder , " suggested Mrs. Miniver tentatively , " whether you 'd find it any easier if you thought about it as back and front ' ? " 259Mrs . MiniverThe woman experimented with this idea for a few moments , and then her brow cleared as if by magic . " Well , that 's funny ! So it is ! It all depends on how you look at things , does n't it ? " She laid the knotted handkerchief on the palm of her hand and beamed at it as proudly as though she had just made a successful cake . Oh , well , thought Mrs. Miniver ; even if no other good comes out of the present condition of the world , at least there soon wo n't be a person left in England who does n't know how to tie a reefknot . And that 's always something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do enjoy me First Aid classes . It 's like being back at school again  --  makes you feel quite young . " " I know , " said Mrs. Miniver . Yes , she thought , that 's the whole point . That is the one great compensation for the fantastic way in which the events of our time are forcing us to live . The structure of our life  --  based as it is on the ever-present contingency of war  --  is lamentably wrong : but its texture , oddly26oLondon in Augustenough , is pleasant . There is a freshness about , a kind of rejuvenation : and this is largely becausealmost everybody you meet is busy learningsomething . Whereas in ordinary times the majority of grown-up people never try to acquireany new skill at all , either mental or physical : which is why they are apt to seem , and feel , so old . She looked at her watch , got up , and walked on towards Kensington Gardens , where Clem had said he would meet her for tea if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campden Hill which had to be finished early in September : this gave him a reason , and Mrs. Miniver an excellent excuse , for spending a good deal of August in London . The children were away , and so were the maids ; Mrs. Burchett came in every morning to do their breakfast , and they had the rest of their meals out . London in August , Mrs. Miniver had long ago discovered , is bleak in theory but enjoyable in practice . For one thing , your circle of acquaintances , without any of the pangs of bereavement or estrangement , is arbitrarily reduced to half its261Mrs . Minivernormal size , with some interesting results . You find yourself knowing better , quite suddenly , people with whom you have been at a standstill for years ; understudies blossom into stars ; even boaks occasionally reveal an unsuspected jewel in the head . And the town itself , too , has a strange charm , in spite of the shuttered houses , the empty window-boxes , the dusty plane-trees , and the smell of hot asphalt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For young Johnny Flint ( whose poems , she noticed , had lately been gettingmore personal and less political ) had said yesterday that anybody who had a genuine passion for London got a particular pleasure out of being there at this time of year , " as you do out of being with somebody you 're really in love with when they 're looking very tired and rather plain . " So that was it . Thank goodness , Mrs. Miniver had thought , as she always did when any of her friends came into love or money . She wondered idly who it could be , but knew that with poets this did n't really matter . Beatrice , Fanny Brawne , Anne More , the Dark Lady of the Sonnets  --  they are all one2 62London in Augustand the same person : or perhaps no person at all . Happy or unhappy , kind or unkind , they are nothing but bundles of firewood . And it will matter little , in after days , Whether this twig , or that , kindled the blaze . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other time of year the great tide of perambulators , which is drawn up into the Park twice a day by some invisible and unvarying moon , would have been on the ebb . They would have been streaming steadily out through every gateway , back to the nursery tea-tables of Bayswater , Kensington , Brompton , Belgravia and Mayfair : sleek , shining , graceful , expensive perambulators , well-built , well-sprung , well-upholstered , pushed by well-trained nurses and occupied by well-bred , well-fed children . What that woman at the luncheon-party had called Really Nice Children : the sort of children who had rocking-horses , and special furniture with rabbits on it , and hats and coats that matched , and grandmothers with houses in the country . But in August the shores of the Park were for-263Mrs . Miniver ; aken by this tide , and another one took its place . They straggled over the worn , slippery grass in little processions  --  whey-faced , thin , ragged , merry and shrewd . The boys carried nets and jam- jars . The eldest girl , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nate baby in it ; and sometimes an ex-baby as well , jammy-mouthed and lolling over the edge . These were the other children . With any luck , if there was a war before they grew up , they would one day see cows , and running streams , and growing corn . But not otherwise . Unless , of course , a miracle happened ; unless the structure could be changed without altering the texture , and the people of England , even after the necessity for it had been averted , re- membered how to tie a reef-knot . Back from Abroad264BACK FROM ABROAD " PARTIR , c'est mourir un peu .... " How shrewdly the French language can drive home a nail , thought Mrs. Miniver , seeing again in her mind 's eye the row of smiling faces to which she had waved a regretful good-bye , the evening before , from the window of the little Alpine train . At her sister-in-law 's request she had travelled out with her niece Alison , who was going to spend six months living with a Swiss family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pension in the same village , just to see that Alison was happily established . The whole family had come to see her off at the station . The solitary porter , standing beside his yellow toy barrow , had had a grass stalk between his teeth ; and the moon , just topping the Mittelhorn , had looked for the space of a breath or two like a vast snow-ball which was about to roll down the glacier. 267Mrs . Miniver Back from AbroadBut why , she wondered , as the serene but unjoyfullandscape of northern France slid past the dining-car windows  --  the white horses , the dun cattle , the red farms , the grey shutters , the beaded cemeteries , the hedgeless fields like foreheads without eyebrows  --  why has nobody ever made the parallel observation : " Revenir , c'est savoir ce que c'est que d'etre un revenant " ? That would be no less shrewd : for when you first come home from a strange place you are always something of a ghost . They were sorry when you went away , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have adjusted their lives a little to your absence . For the first meal or two , there is not quite enough room for your chair . They ask , " Where did you go ? What was it like ? " ; but for the life of you you can not tell them . You can say , " It was like a large , neat Scotland " ; or " They use nonante instead of quatre-vingt-dix " ; or , " They trim all their buildings with wooden lace " ; or , " There was a nice little German boy staying at the pension " ; or " I made friends with a charming farmer at the village fete . " But however eagerly268they listen they do not really take in what you are saying . For you can not make them understand the essential point , which is that when you went away you took the centre of the universe with you , so that the whole thing went on revolving , just as usual , round your own head . How could they , indeed , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the time the centre of everything stayed at home with them ? It is a day or two , as a rule , before your universe and theirs ( like the two images in a photographic range-finder ) merge and become concentric : and when that happens , you know you are really home . But that moment , for Mrs. Miniver , was still far ahead . She had not even quite detached herselfyet from the place she had just left . Like the earth-bound spirit of one who has recently died , she still thought in terms of the life she had been leading . Glancing up at the clock of the dining car , she reflected : " Hansi 's mother will just be tying the napkin round his neck ; and he will be saying , Bit-te , Mama , keinen Blumenkohl . ' " The first time she had heard him say this she had269Mrs . Miniver Back from Abroadcaught his mother 's eye and smiled : for the tone and the sentiment were so exactly Toby 's . She had smiled , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aber du , Hansi , bast du dir die Zahne gut geputzt ? " But she had done more than smile when Hansi , after a day or two 's distant politeness , had taken her by the hand and led her to a row of curiously-shaped pebbles in a secret hiding-place between the wood-stacks . " Meine Sammlung , " he said briefly . " My election , " echoed Toby 's voice in her memory . Her heart turned over : how could there be this ridiculous talk of war , when little boys in all countries collected stones , dodged cleaning their teeth , and hated cauliflower ? Indeed , what always struck her when she went abroad was how much stronger the links are betweenpeople of the same calling than between people of the same race : especially if it is a callingwhich has more truck with the laws of naturethan with the laws of man . The children of the world are one nation ; the very old , another ; the blind , a third : ( for childhood , age and blindness are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who works with wood , a man who works with iron , a man who works with test-tubes , is more akin to a joiner , a smith , a research chemist from the other end of the earth than to a clerk or a shopkeeper in his own town . A fisherman from Ushant and a fisherman from Stornoway are both citizens of the same relentlesscountry ; and Nicollier , the farmer with whom Mrs. Miniver had made friends at the village fete , had expressed in a different tongue precisely the same feelings and opinion as Tom ( Brickwall ) Iggulsden . If only , she thought , sipping her black coffee , one could somehow get them together  --  not the statesmen and the diplomats , but Toby and Hansi , Iggulsden and Nicollier . If only all governmentswould spend the price of a few bombers on exchanging for the holidays , free of charge , a certain number of families from each district . . . . The attendant brought her bill . She paid it , burying her last thought as a dog buries a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed Boulognenow and were on the last lap of the journey to Calais . As one does when there are271Mrs .

On the window . sill she read : Ne pas se pencher en dehors . Nicht hinauslehnen . E pericoloso sporgersi . Exactly , she thought . " What I say three times is true . " But the trouble was , it still had to be said in three different languages ... . 2 72At the Hop-PickingAT THE HOP-PICKINGBRICKWALL FARM consisted mostly of fruit and pasture : so few acres were under hops that Tom Iggulsden did not engage any professional pickers from London . He did the picking himself , with the aid of his wife , his mother , his five children , and any of the neighbours who cared to lend a hand : which generally included the whole Miniver family . This time the Minivers were enjoying it even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual helpers , doing it for fun and leaving off whenever they felt inclined . But this year they knew that Tom Iggulsden was really countingon them , for he was short of his three best workers . Both his sons had been called up , and his eldest daughter Ivy had gone off to try and get a job in a munition factory . Old Mrs. Iggulsden , who was picking into the275Mrs . Miniversame bin as Mrs. Miniver , disapproved of Ivy 's behaviour and was saying so with some force . " She never ' ad naow sanse , diddn ' Ive . Gooin ' arf jus " fore de ' aapin ' , an ' leavin ' ' er Dad short-'anded . . . . Reckon I 'd ' ve prin ' nigh flawed ' er alive , if I 'd ' a ' bin Taam . " " Now den , Ma , " said Tom Iggulsden with a grin , stretching up his long-poled knife to cut down a bine . He laid the thick twisted swag of greenery across the canvas bin and winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You git aan wid y'r owan jaab , Ma , an ' leave Ivy be . If she rackoned she ought to goo , she ' ad to goo , diddn ' she ? " " I don ' see naow sort o ' sanse in it , " mumbled the old woman , quite unconvinced . " She 'd be doin ' more good a-pickin ' o ' dese ' ere ' aaps fer to goo into folk 's bellies , dan a'makin ' o ' dem old bullets fer to goo into deir ' cads . " Tom Iggulsden 's wife , overhearing this from the next bin , shot an apologetic glance at Mrs. Miniver . She had a light hand with pastry but was a little inclined to be genteel ; and her motherin-law'srobustness of speech often made her uncomfortable , especially in front of " foreigners . " At the Hop-Picking " Of course , " put in Mrs. Miniver diplomatically , " some people would try to make out that hops were nearly as bad as bullets . Teetotallers , I mean . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal scorn . She stripped off her next handful of cones almost vindictively : they fell into the halffullbin without a sound , light , soft and ghostly , a dozen little severed heads of teetotallers . Presently there came the familiar cry of the bin-man , who walked round every so often to ladle the hops out into ten-bushel pokes . " Git your ' aaps ready , please ! " Warned of his approach , they left off picking and set to work to clear out all the odd leaves and pieces of stalk which had dropped in by mistake . This was the part that the children enjoyed most , because it meant leaning right over the edge and plunging one 's arms elbow-deep into the feathery goldy-green mass . The role of bin-man , this year , was played by Tom Iggulsden himself , in the intervals of cuttingdown bines ; and his assistant , who held the mouth of the poke open , was Vin . When the two of them arrived everybody stopped working276 277Mrs . Miniver At the Flop-Pickingand tried to guess how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I rackon , " said old Mrs. Iggulsden . " Fifteen , " said Judy hopefully . But Tom , takingthe first scoop with his wicker basket , said " Thirteen . " And thirteen it turned out to be . It was certainly a relief to knock off for a bit , to straighten one 's back and stretch out one 's fingers . They had been going hard at it ever since lunch-time , with the effortless industry which is born of working with good company , in pleasant surroundings , at a perceptibly progressingtask . It was like knitting : you could n't bear to stop until you had done one more row , one more bine . But it was also like watching the sea come in on a calm day , as the soft green tide crept steadily up the brown cliffs of the bin . Old Mrs. Iggulsden reached under her stool for a bottle and took a generous swig . " Ma . . . ! " said her daughter-in-law , going through hell . " ' Aaps outside needs ' aaps inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that right , Mrs. Mimver ? " She wiped her mouth on the back of her hand . Her briar-root fingers , which could still278strip a bine more quickly than most people 's , were stained black with juice and covered with scratches from the rough clinging stems . So indeedwere everybody 's , except for those who were not too proud to wear gloves . But though gloves could protect one from stains and scratches , nothing could protect one from the drowsiness , the nearly irresistible drowsiness , which comes over all but the most hardened towards the end of a long day 's picking . It seems to be more than a scent that emanates from the hops : it is almost a visible miasma , sweet yet agreeably acrid , soothingyet tonic , which blurs the edges of one 's thoughts with a greenish-gold glow . " Where 's Toby ? " said Mrs. Miniver suddenly . Nobody knew . " I ' a' n't seen nothin ' of ' im since dinner-time , " said Mrs. Iggulsden . " Ver ' like ' e 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But he was not at the far bin , nor at any of the others . Mrs. Miniver , always a little uneasyabout the main road , went off to look for him . It was extraordinary how soon , wandering through the narrow leafy aisles , one got out of sight of the others . For a short time
