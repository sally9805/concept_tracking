One of our Berlin correspondents advised us recently that thanks to the new currency regulations he felt practically " streamlined " because he no longer had to carry currency control books . An inspection of his lightened pockets disclosed , however , that in order to do his job in Germany he still had to have on his person some 25 items-from " travel orders in 15 copies permitting movement about Germany " to " a car owner 's license the size of the front page of Stars and Stripes . " <P> Curious to know what our correspondents in other countries must carry to cover the postwar news , we asked them to empty their pockets and tell us what they found . Here is a typical summary , from Fred Gruin , TIME correspondent in Nanking . <P> Pocket contents : one reporter 's notebook ; one address book ; one batch name cards , minus which it is almost impossible to do business in China ( front of card bears my name in English ; reverse side has the Chinese translation , Go Ho Ping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; low folk to remark : " Very nice name " ) ; one pen , one pencil , one penknife , one passport , two car keys ; one inoculation certificate showing 14 original shots plus regular boosters , minus which air travel is taboo ; one Chinese Government certificate of registration as a correspondent ; about 30,000 dollars Chinese , which is the equivalent of a double-size stuffed wallet and worth about $10 U.S. ( when carrying more Chinese dollars I must bring an overnight bag or briefcase along ) ; one piece of string to keep currency wad tight ; a phone installation bill of $50 U.S. ( one coke in Nanking costs $1 U.S. ) ; assorted cables from New York , etc . I leave my wallet at home , since it is inadequate . <P> And so it goes-allowing for each country 's particular brand of red tape - with most of our correspondents . In India , the most useful document is a press pass to the Viceroy 's house , which , although outdated now , still gets you anywhere ( even into Gandhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Buenos Aires , each government and municipal department has its own special pass for admittance . Great Britain , on the other hand , requires only two cards ( national identity and alien registration ) to work there . <P> Keys , not documents , weigh down our correspondent in Rome , where burglars now flourish . He has to carry about 30 of them : keys to the door of his house , the pantry , dispensary , clothes closet , private desk , passenger elevator ; to the door of his office building , his office door , the third intermediate door ; to his typewriter , office desk , locker . Cigarets have to be kept in doubly-locked separate chests , and the jeep has to be locked six ways from breakfast , involving keys to the steering wheel , ignition , hood , spare tire , gas tank and tool locker . <P> Knowing the hardships of covering the news in Russia , we were especially anxious to hear from our Moscow correspondent . When he did not reply after a decent interval , we re-queried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy was coming through all right . <P> Wondering whether he was once again a victim of the unpredictable vagaries of Soviet censorship , we cabled him as follows : <P> <P> ON OUR REQUERY 723 . HAVE YOU BEEN TOO PRESSED FOR TIME TO GIVE US YOUR POCKET CONTENTS OR IS THERE TOO MUCH IRON TO REPORT ? <P>
