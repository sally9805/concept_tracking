How to Combat Hilter <P> When Republicans damn the New Deal , they usually make an exception for the personal character , if not the ideas , of Henry Agard Wallace . Last week in his acceptance speech Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate Charles McNary said that his rival was " a high-minded and sympathetic Secretary of Agriculture . " Last week Wendell Willkie said " Mr. Wallace is a fine gentleman . " <P> Henry Wallace stood last week on the cornstalk-decorated stage of the Coliseum in Des Moines to undergo what was a political ordeal for a shy man-to accept the Democratic nomination for Vice President . His unruly hair combed back for a change , his wide features expanding in a boyish grin , he beamed on the crowd in a way that made it unmistakable-it was a great occasion for him . The crowd of 7,000 to 8,000 , almost filling the Coliseum , roared back , waved banners WELCOME HOME , HANK and WHO WANTS WINDY WENDELL WILLKIE ? <P> Magic Name . In his opening words warmhearted Henry Wallace spoke of the honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other , represents security for democracy in the modern world . " There were roars for his sentiments : <P> " For nearly eight years President Roosevelt has battled for democracy and freedom . . . . Roosevelt believed in government by the people and for the people . . . . Roosevelt believed in putting the common man first . . . Roosevelt believed in the good-neighbor policy , among individuals and among nations . . . . Roosevelt believed in peace through preparedness . . . . Roosevelt believed in freer world trade and a higher standard of living . . . . Roosevelt was its democracy 's eager servant and faithful defender . . . . Only Roosevelt had the unusual combination of many months spent as a boy in European countries , a comprehensive knowledge of history , experience as Assistant Secretary of the Navy . . . access to the day-by-day information . . . and wisdom to relate that information to its significance for America . . . . " All told he mentioned " Roosevelt " or " the President " 31 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Whatever the Motive . With ardent Wallace tributes ran sombre Wallace warnings against Adolf Hitler , which he made into a campaign argument : With Franklin Roosevelt standing for democracy and Adolf Hitler standing for dictatorship , those who opposed him were Hitler 's conscious or innocent allies . Charging that Republican leadership has not understood the meaning of Hitler 's rise , he declared : <P> " When Roosevelt tried to adjust the internal affairs of the United States to a sick world , they fought him at home as Hitler fought him abroad . Some of the bitter attacks on Roosevelt 's program were directly inspired by the agents of Hitler in this country . Others were merely blindly partisan . But , whatever the motive , the effect was the same-these attacks on Roosevelt and his program played into the hands of Hitler . Every evidence of opposition to Roosevelt within the United States has been reason for rejoicing in Berlin . . . .
