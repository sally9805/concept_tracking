To the time-honored list of things which U.S. politicians may be counted upon to denounce relentlessly-the housefly , the common cold , the man-eating shark-Washington 's Senator Homer Bone in 1937 added cancer . When he introduced a bill for a National Cancer Institute , it bore the sponsoring signatures of 94 Senators . ( The other two hastened to add theirs before the bill came to a vote . ) Last fortnight Missouri 's Bennett Champ Clark hit on something which politicians almost as unanimously favor . He introduced a veterans ' benefits bill , jointly sponsored by 80 other Senators . Last week , amid plaints by the remaining 15 Senators that they had not had a chance to sign it in advance , the Senate passed the bill unanimously . The House is expected to follow suit this week . <P> The bill came from the American Legion . It was nicknamed the " G.I. Bill of Rights , " as it combined in a single measure most of the proposals for helping veterans that have been made in Congress , except mustering-out pay ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending bill , backed by five other veterans ' organizations , would give each World War II veteran a bonus of up to $4,500 . ) Prime provisions : <P> Schooling for at least one year , and up to four ; in elementary , business , high or higher schools ; with allowances of $500 a year for tuition , plus $50 a month for subsistence and an extra $25 for one or more dependents . <P> Loans up to $1,000 for buying homes , farms , farm equipment or business properties , with no interest the first year , and only 3% thereafter . <P> Special job-finding services . Unemployment benefits up to 52 weeks at $15 a week , plus an extra $5 for one dependent , $8 for two , $10 for three . <P> $500,000,000 for new veterans ' hospitals . <P> The Veterans ' Administration , which would manage these benefits , would now become a primary war agency , with priorities second only to those of the War and Navy Departments in obtaining personnel , equipment and supplies . <P> Chairman Walter F. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $3,500,000,000 . But the economy-minded Senator and his Committee were not aghast at this sum . While the bill is " admittedly more extensive and generous " than any in history , said they , " we view it as true economy , the best money that can be spent for the future welfare of the nation . The men and women who compose our armed forces . . . not only now hold the destiny of this Republic firmly in their hands , they will so hold it for a generation to come . "
