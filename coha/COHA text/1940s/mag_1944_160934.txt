INTERNATIONAL <P> Under Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius Jr . was seeing everybody . To Prime Minister Winston Churchill he took a fine acorn-fed Virginia ham with the fat all on it , sat and talked late in the P.M. 's bedroom . Next day he settled to long , earnest talks with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden . He lunched with the Bank of England 's new Governor , Lord Catto ( TIME , April 17 ) , Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Anderson , saw Imperial Chemical 's Lord McGowan , Production Minister Oliver Lyttelton . He also had an audience with King George VI . <P> Big Ed , on his first big-time diplomatic mission , felt that he was getting somewhere . So did correspondents who watched him in action . Cabled TIME Correspondent Charles Wertenbaker , examining the background of Stettinius ' mission to London : <P> " Stung by public criticism at the time of Welles 's resignation , Hull decided that the U.S. must have an independent foreign policy directed by the State Department and not simply drift along on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the winter this pursuit of an independent policy has resulted in some strain between the U.S. and Britain , much fear that economic and political rivalry would set them against each other when war ends . By the time of Stettinius ' trip , strains had already become apparent over Arabian oil , recognition of De Gaulle , Italian policy , attitude toward the Polish-Russian dispute , Argentine sanctions and the treatment of other neutrals . Stettinius ' trip was made primarily to iron out as many as possible of these differences and to re-establish warm relations , this time between the State Department and Foreign Office rather than just between Churchill and Roosevelt .
