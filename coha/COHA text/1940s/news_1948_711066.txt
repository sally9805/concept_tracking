txt The Council of Economic Advisers , it was learned today , plans a survey of Federal grants-in-aid , which amount to about $1,000,000,000 yearly , with a view to revising the policy of assistance to states and municipalities . The survey will start in April , when members of the Council 's staff Will confer with representatives of state and local governments . A legislative program to change standards for distribution of the grants may grow out of the study . In any event , the Council expects the project to clarify the subject , as there ? is widespread dissatisfaction with the system among Federal agencies as well as local governments . A spokesman for the Council said the system of grants began even before the Constitution was adopted , and has expanded vastly in a more or less aimless fashion . The Council , which is a White House agency , is acting on a directive laid down by President Truman a year ago . He stated his purpose in his economic report for 1947 , explaining that further aid programs were planned for health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The survey will begin with a series of informal conferences with organizations such as the Council of State Governments , the United States Conference of Mayors , and the Municipal Finance Officers ' Association . Among questions for study are : The effect on the economy of the grants , which expanded during the depression , contracted in wartime , and now are increasing again ; whether the right functions are being aided ; how grants can be most effectively used ; whether undue emphasis is put on some programs ; whether the most equitable and economic system of distributing funds is followed . For the Council , a spokesman estimated that 90 per cent of the grants are made on a fifty-fifty basis  --  the Federal Government matching state outlays dollar for dollar . This 90 per cent consists of money in the Social Security , agricultural and road and airport programs . About 70 per cent of all grants are those administered by the Federal Security Agency for old-age benefits , aid to the blind and to dependent children . These also are on a fifty-fifty basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as against state action . Certain states seek a larger return for the Federal taxes paid by their people . An example of this criticism appeared in this resolution recently adopted by the Indiana Legislature : " Indiana needs no guardian and intends to have none . We Hoosiers ? like the people of our sister states  --  were fooled for quite a spell with the magician 's trick that a dollar taxed out of our pockets and sent to Washington will be bigger when it comes back to us . We have taken a good look at said dollar . We find that it lost weight in its journey to Washington and back . " The political brokerage of the bureaucrats has been deducted . We have decided that there is no such thing as ' Federal ' aid . We know that there is no wealth to tax that is not already within the boundaries of the forty-eight states . " So we propose henceforward to tax ourselves and take care of ourselves . We are fed up with subsidies , doles and paternalism . We are no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that we will resist Washington , D. C. , adopting us . " The resolution ended with a request to Indiana 's Congressional delegation " to fetch our county court houses and city halls back from Pennsylvania Avenue . " - That plain talk from the Hoosier State was regarded as on the extreme side , as most ' states gladly received the grants . A basic question that will be ? examined , however , is whether the rigid specifications on use of grants should not be relaxed . An example of the criticism on this point has been that the enabling legislation specifies narrowly the use of funds , for instance , for tuberculosis or venereal disease control . Some states would prefer , it was said , a general health grant , so that the money could be applied where it is most needed in their over-all health . program . According to the Council 's spokesman , the Federal Security Agency has gone on record for lump-sum grants in the social security field , leaving it to the states to make equitable apportionment for the aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : be needed to effect the change .
