Time turned backward for aging William Randolph Hearst . Once again , as in the days of his beloved Spanish-American War ( when Hearst himself dramatically " invaded " Cuba from a chartered steamboat , captured 26 wet , befuddled Spanish sailors whose ship had been sunk in the Battle of Santiago ) , a Hearst reporter was dashing about , brushing the Army &; Navy aside , taking strategically important objectives singlehanded , and revealing all . The reporter : bulky , handsome Clark ( " Chang " ) Lee , 38 . In six days , by his own word , Clark Lee had : Been the first to find " Tokyo Rose " ( see RADIO ) . <P> Accepted the " surrender " of part of the Japanese fleet from his old Shanghai golfing partner , Rear Admiral Masao Kanazawa , who proposed that both sides should now have a drink together , as after a golf match . <P> Captured in Japan Gestapo Colonel Joseph Meisinger , whom Lee identified as the " Brutal Butcher of Warsaw . " Colonel Meisinger obligingly signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Brumby of Mutual Broadcasting and John A. Bockhorst of News of the Day Newsreel . " <P> This kind of Richard Harding Davis journalism had been going on ever since Clark Lee had the good fortune to be sitting in the A.P . ' s Manila office on Dec. 7 , 1941 . His father was an early president of U.P. , but Clark went to work for the A.P . instead , worked first in Latin America , then in the Far East ( where he married a Hawaiian princess , Liliuokalani Kawananakoa ) . Friends in the Japanese Army tipped him off in November 1941 that it was time to get out of Shanghai . <P> Having gotten as far as Manila , Clark Lee spent days in Bataan 's front lines , sent in some of the Pacific war 's first eye-witnessers-and some of the first enthusiastic stories of MacArthur 's military genius . He got out to Australia just before MacArthur , came home to write a bestseller , They Call It Pacific , urging more guns and men in the East . This suited Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . at a fat raise , but then packed him off to Europe . In the ETO , Lee was a fish out of his Pacific waters . He never really paid off for Hearst until he went back to Bataan-and Tokyo .
