THE HERO A Stay DAN WICKENDEN H E OPENED the door so quietly that nobody heard him come in . Until then it had been in no way different from other evenings that winter . Mama and Loraine were knitting and Papa was listening to the radio ; and sometimes when the laughter of the audience far off in a New York studio died down you could hear wind along the street . If Eddie was in their thoughts at all  --  and probably he wa .. never altogether out of Mama 's  --  he was there only vaguely , a buried anguish , a boy on a ship they could never imagine precisely , sailing an ocean they would never see . But Loraine felt cold air strike her legs , and looked up ; and there he was , standing just inside the door with his hands in his pockets and the round flat hat tilted jauntily on his head . The smile on his face tried hard to he jaunty too , but it was n't the way he used to smile . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost her voice for a moment . She could only sit there staring at her brother , fumbling with the sweater she was knitting for Ab . But Mama , though she had grown so stout , went swiftly across the room . She clung to Eddie and buried her face against his shoulder , repeating his name until her voice wavered into tears . And Papa was so excited that he forgot to shut off theradio ; while they crowded about Eddie , pulled him into the room , and took his hat and coat from him , the voice of the announcer went on and on , praising a nickel candy bar . Eddie stood quite still with his hands hanging straight at his sides and shut his eyes for a moment , with a look on his face as if he believed the warm bright room might have vanished when he opened them again , leaving only the dark Pacific to gaze at . He was taller than any of them and their agitation seemed not to touch him . They sat down presently and Mama chattered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept on smiling the same queer smile that was somehow worse than weeping . He still looked like Eddie  --  much too young to be involved in a war  --  but he was changed , even from the way he had been when he came home on leave from Great Lakes after his basic training was finished . He had been self-conscious about his uniform then but he was a real sailor now and looked out of place in the room Mama was so proud of , among the deep soft chairs , the mahogany end tables , the brocade curtains elegantly looped at the window where the little service banner with its one blue star swung gently in the draft . Eddie had brought with him something which had never been in the room before ; he smiled stiffly out from this strangeness and told himself perhaps that things were not quite the way he had remembered them . " But Eddie , why did n't you tell us ? " Mama was saying . " You could 've let us know you were coming . You just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Wanted to surprise you . " Eddie cleared his throat ; his free hand fidgeted , reached out presently , and took one of Papa 's cigarettes from the box on the table . Instead of being annoyed Papa stood up to strike a light for Eddie . " You surprised us all right , " he said . He had buttoned up his vest and now he glanced about for his jacket , as uneasy in shirtsleeves as if he were receiving company . " Scared Mama out of a year 's growth . " He winked at Eddie , but his tired , seamed face with the loose , heavy folds of flesh had an unsettled look , as if he wanted to cry the way Mama had . " How long you going to be home , Eddie ? " Loraine asked , beating at the grief which hung about them so unreasonably , because he was here , he was alive and well , was n't he ? " Well , I got thirty days altogether . With traveling and everything though , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . " " Thirty days ! " Papa whistled , and Mama sat back to get a better look at Eddie . " Eddie , what 's wrong ? " she asked . " Something terrible 's happened . Eddie , your ship ? " She raised one hand quickly to her mouth . Eddie blew a smoke ring . " Naw , nothing 's happened . Navy figured I needed a rest , that 's all . " " Now , listen ? " Papa 's voice sounded angry . Eddie sat watching the smoke go up from his cigarette . " Where I been it was all pretty quiet , " he said , speaking carefully . " And I ca n't talk . I got orders not to talk , even to my own family . " Papa could n't hide his anger and Loraine remembered the scene lie had made , a week after Pearl Harbor , when Eddietold him he wanted to enlist . All right , go ahead and join the Navy , Papa had shouted finally . That 's all you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ever be good for . Because in those days Papa could n't see it in terms of fighting for your country ; he had been able to see only his own disappointment in Eddie , quitting school , refusing to work in the store , getting fired from one poor job after another and finally just loafing around home or spending half the night in poolrooms . " Stands to reason something 's happened , " Papa said . " Thirty days . That 's survivor 's leave . " But Eddie shut his lips tight . Mama took his hand again . " At least we can put a piece in the paper about you . First thing to-morrow we 'll go downtown and get a nice picture taken . A real good one , I do n't care how much it costs . And then ? " " No , Mama . No piece in the paper . " Mama flushed . " But Eddie , all the other boys  --  I been waiting so long . " " Sorry , Mama . That 's orders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the look on her face : she had n't given up her intention but only tucked it away for a while . " My lands , " she said brightly . " We sit here talking at you and you 're prob'ly starving to death . You come right in the kitchen this minute and get a bite to eat . " Soon enough they grew used to the idea that Eddie was to be with them for a few weeks , although much of the time he might still have been thousands of miles away , for all they saw of him . He slept through the mornings , through half of the afternoons ; often he would be getting up just as Loraine reached home from the office and would come down unshaven , his face still heavy and puffed with sleep . He was drugged with weariness ; it seemed as if he would never , for the rest of his life , catch up with all the sleep the war had stolen from him . Mama took pains over her dinners . In his letters Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had been a little hurt ; because how could it seem good after her meals ? But Eddie sat silent at table . indiW errntIv t-at ; ne , ever was set before him , still lost in the remoteness he had brought home from the Pacific . Loraine thought about him all day long as she sat at her typewriter in Mr. Mergenthaler 's drafty law offices ; her mind went away from the tapping keys , the windows rattling in their frames , the steam knocking in the radiators , and she thought she could almost see things as Eddie was seeing them . Sometimes at table she had caught a look of pain on his face as he stared at Mama and Papa and herself . They were ordinary , that was the trouble  --  no more the way Eddie had thought of them on board his ship than the house was . They were ordinary people , homely and dull and a little tired . And the house was only a box , like twenty other boxes in a row along the street , grayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time it had been painted . In his thoughts when he was far away there had been a shimmer on the house and the people who lived in it ; but now he was here and had not found what he had expected . Each night at dinner it was the same , with only Papa doing the talking : about the store , about the government , about food and gasoline rationing and the difficult life he led . Except that Eddie was in uniform and had such a dazed , lost look , he might never have been away . After dinner he would go out . " Do n't wait up for mc , " he always said , and was gone into the cold night , with never a word about where he went or what he did until the small hours of the morning . But Mama talked while she and Loraine did the dishes . She could n't stop talking about Eddie then  --  how well he was looking , how he 'd put on weight , how he was a real man now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And good-looking too , " Mama said . " I guess he got all the good looks in the family . Maybe I should n't say so , but anybody 'd have to admit he 's a real good-looking boy , Loraine . One thing about a war , " Mama said , pushing her plump hand round and round the greasy sink to gather up fragments , " one thing about a war , guess he do n't have much chance to  --  Well , you know , in those foreign ports and all . Not that Eddie ever would , he 's a fine , idealistic boy , but still ? " Then she looked embarrassed . " He goes over to see Louella Mae prob'ly every night . " " Maybe he does , " Loraine said , not believing it . " Guess she 's been eating her heart out for Eddie , pretty near . And he looks so cute in his sailor suit and all . What is it they call him now , Loraine ? That rating he got ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means . I wish to goodness he 'd talk . He just do n't tell us anything . Not what he does on the ship or anything . " Mama bent over , scrubbing the sink . " To-morrow I 'm going to go ahead and put a piece in the paper about him , if he says I can or not . Just because he 's modest that 's no reason all those other boys should get all the glory . " " But , Mama , it is n't because he 's modest . It 's like he said , it 's a kind of secret he 's home , and ? " " A secret ! I suppose he was invisible , getting off the train . Do n't tell me ! " " But ? " " I 'm sick and tired reading about all those other boys , and never a word about Eddie . And most of them still in the United States . Why , my lands , even Ab 's been in the paper , " Mama said , spiteful for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry Loraine , had flat feet and bad eyes and had waited round until he was drafted and sent to Camp McCoy on limited service . " Eddie 's been in the war , he 's really been in it . " Mama hung her apron in the closet . " My mind 's made up , " she said . Loraine had a cold coming on and could n't get to sleep that night . She was sitting up in bed reading when Eddie finally came in , and he must have seen the light shining under her door , because he stopped when he reached it and scratched on the panel with his fingernails , the way he used to years ago . Even if she had n't smelled his breath when he came in she would have known he 'd been drinking . There was color in his cheeks , his eyes were too bright , and he swayed a little , grinning at her and clasping the end of the bed . " Hi , Beautiful , " he said , repeating an old formula almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud ! Mama and Papa . . . Shut the door . . . . You been out with Louella Mae ? " " Naw . " Eddie dropped into the chair by the window ; he stretched his legs out and tilted the hat down over his eyes . He was a little drunk but he looked younger again , hardly older than his eighteen years . " I was out with some of the boys , " he said . " There 's quite a bunch of sailors in town now . Kids , " said Eddie with a touch of scorn . " Just through boot training . " He yawned . " Jesus , I 'm tired , " he said . " You ought to go to bed , Eddie . " " Yeah , I will in a minute . " Loraine closed her book . " Eddie , think I ought to warn you . Mama 's planning to go ahead and put a piece in the paper , if you say she can or not . She 's going to walk right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and his hat fell off . " She ca n't , Loraine . You got to stop her . She . . . " " Something really did happen , Eddie , did n't it ? " " Yeah , something happened , all right . " He picked up his hat and spun it un one finger . " I might as well tell you , Loraine , " he said , staring at his hat . " I 'm not going back . " ' Eddie , you mean . . . " " Not because I 'm scared to . It 's just . . . Well , anyway , I made up my mind . I 'm not going back . " He said it loudly this time because he did n't believe what he was saying and was frightened at the sound of his own words . " But Eddie  --  desertion in time of war . " " Yeah . " " But if all the boys did that after . . . " But what right had she to talk , doing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds ? " Maybe it was n't so bad for some of them , " Eddie said . He stopped spinning his hat and sat quietly for a long time ; it had started to snow and the small hard flakes came in dry whispers against the window . " I was in the water four hours , " Eddie said presently , staring down at his hands . " All the time I was swimming Ikept thinking ... What I thought about , " he said with a kind of shyness , " I remembered summers when I was a kid . How we 'd ride our bikes out to the river and go swimming , and how hot the sun was afterward . And the way the fields looked on the way home when the wheat was ripe . I made believe I was just a kid swimming in the river , and when I got tired I could climb out and sit in the sun awhile and then ride my bike home to supper . " " Four hours , " Loraine said . " Gee , Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If I 'd 've jumped sooner maybe I 'd 've been picked up sooner . I did n't want to leave her , but she was all ablaze , the whole damn ship . And she was brand-new practically . Brand-new . " Eddie 's voice trembled . " You do n't know how you get to feel about your ship , " he said . Loraine tried to think what it must have been like and could n't ; all she could think was that it had n't been so long ago after all that Eddie really was a kid riding home on his bike between the wheat-fields . " It was after dark when they picked us up , " he said presently . " We got to a life raft , but there was too many on it already , so then we started heading for a destroyer . It was so hard to keep that fellow 's head above water , he . . But we got to it , almost , only something happened : she must 've got some warning ur something because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . " " You mean you saved another boy 's life ? " Eddie shook his head . " I kept on swimming with him until finally , after dark , this lifeboat came along and picked us up . He died aboard the destroyer . All the time I was swimming with him in the water he was dying . If I could 've just . . . " Eddie stopped short . The door had opened , and Mama came in with her old pink flannel bathrobe pulled round her , and her hair down her back in a short gray braid . She stood just inside the room blinking at them resentfully . " You 'll talk to her but you wo n't talk to me , " Mama said . " Your own mother . " She glanced at Loraine as if she hated her . " Now , Mama . . . " Eddie stood up . " Your own mother , " Mama repeated bitterly , and then her face crumpled . " Eddie , if you knew what I been through , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was n't telling Loraine anything , Mama . " Mama clung to him . " You 're only eighteen , Eddie . You could 've waited , could n't you ? You could 've waited for the draft . Maybe the whole war would 've been over by the time you got drafted . . . . Eddie , you 're the only son I got . " " I 'm all right , Mama , " he said gently . " They ca n't kill me . They wo n't ever kill me . Why , Mama , I 'm not even scratched . " Loraine saw that he had not meant what he said about deserting . He would be going back all right when the time came . After that Eddie stayed home more often and he was sitting in the same room with them when the news came over the radio that his ship had been torpedoed . It did not really surprise Mama or Papa ; they had guessed the truth long ago . Mama got her obstinate look and said , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper . You 're going down to the Journal first thing in the morning and tell them the whole story . And you tell them they can take your picture themselves . I guess they owe it to you after what you been through . " Eddie stood up and began to walk restlessly about the room . He came to a pause at the window and flicked his finger at the service banner . " What difference does it make if I get my name in the paper or not ? " he said finally . " Gee Mama , I do n't want to . .. ca n't talk about it . I was told not to . " " But all the people who know you , Eddie . They 'd like to read about it . And I could send copies to my folks , and Papa 's folks . " " Now , take my customers , " Papa said . " Everybody who comes into the store , pretty near , they ask about you all the time . Where you are , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name in the paper , it would help business a whole lot , " Papa said wistfully . But Loraine knew that was n't what he meant . He had been ashamed of Eddie once and now he was proud of him and wanted people to know why . If Eddie 's picture appeared in the paper and the story of what he 'd been through Papa 's customers would mention it to him and Papa could admit he 'd been wrong about his son without ever having to say so in so many words . " I 'm sorry , " Eddie said , " but I just ca n't do it . I ca n't , and that 's all there is to it . " They argued a long time until Loraine got up and left them ; her cold was worse and her head ached , and she thought she could n't stand it if they worked themselves up into a real scene , the way they used to in the days before the war . Her cold was so bad next morning that Mama made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could hear her calling Mr. Mergenthaler on the telephone . And then Mama dialed another number . She was calling the Journal . Loraine was sitting downstairs in the pale sunlight that fell through the living-room window , finishing the sweater for Ab , when the photographer and the reporter came up the front steps and pushed the doorbell . It was about eleven o'clock and Eddie was still asleep ; Mama had betrayed him . The reporter was a woman , Miss Sparrow , small and brisk and a little bedraggled , like her name ; the photographer was a young man who tried to conceal the limp which was keeping him out of the Army . Loraine knew them both quite well ; her aching head made her feel confused , and when Miss Sparrow produced a pencil and a wad of copy paper and began to ask questions Loraine could n't help answering , though now she too was betraying Eddie . She repeated to Miss Sparrow everything he had told her that night . " Why , he 's a real hero , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our first war hero . . . . And he never said a word to anybody till the news broke last night ? " " Well , he did kind of tell me a little , before , but . . . " " We wo n't say that of course . . . . Where 's that copy of the early edition , Johnny , with the story about it ? - . . We thought we 'd take a picture of him reading the story with your mother , " Miss Sparrow explained to Loraine . " Sort of telling her how it was . " Then Mama came downstairs with Eddie , who looked sullen and still half asleep ; but Mama 's face was triumphant . " It 's just so dramatic , " Miss Sparrow said , while the photographer arranged Mama in a chair , with Eddie sitting on the arm pointing at the photograph of his ship on the front page of the Journal . " A survivor right here in town the whole time , and never letting on about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . . Did you say you were on the football team in high school ? " " Oh , now , for . You do n't have to put that in , do you ? " Eddie said . But the photographer had screwed a flash bulb in place and was ready to take the picture . " If you 'll just turn your head a little bit more , " he said to Eddie . " That 's it . And now a great big smile , both of you , because you 're so glad to be together again . " He took the picture and two more after that ; but Mama looked tense and Eddie looked stubborn . And later he would n't speak to Mama or Loraine . He put on his hat and leather jacket and walked out ; he was gone all day and Mama fretted about it until the home edition of the Journal arrived . The photograph was spread across three columns of the front page and Miss Sparrow 's story filled the better part of two columns beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her thoughts . He would n't look at the paper when he came in at dinnertime . It was n't so much that the story gave him more credit for heroism than he thought he deserved , Loraine decided . It was because it made the experience dwindle ; it reduced it to a few glib paragraphs of ink on paper that would soon yellow and be thrown away , or used to kindle a fire or line a shelf . For all who read the story it put a period to something so overwhelming it might not stop , for Eddie , until he died . The last days of Eddie 's leave dropped away and he was still lost and aimless , puzzled because all the things he had looked forward to doing gave him no satisfaction . He took Louella Mae out on dates ; he shot pool or went bowling with friends of his who still were n't in service ; he sat for hours drinking beer with other sailors on leave , and came home tipsy at two and three in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they never reproached him . To them the story and the picture had somehow become of greater importance than what Eddie had actually been through : they knew their son was a hero because the Journal had called him one , and a buried hunger in them had been appeased . They were radiant in those last days ; they seemed younger than they had for years . But on the Sunday morning when Eddie left there was no pride or gaiety in Mama . Once the station had been an exciting place to Loraine because it was the starting point for happy journeys : to Detroit , to Chicago , and once , the first summer she had her job with Mr. Mergenthaler , to a week in New York which still remained the high point of her life . But in these days the station had come to mean nothing but departures to the war . In the high shed the steam floated up and hung against the corrugated-iron roof until a wind from the open tracks dispersed it ; but no wind could disperse the great weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve months . The heaviness settled upon them as they stood there ; it settled upon them and all the others who huddled in groups about the boys in uniform , and stifled whatever it was people had kept in mind to say for the last minutes . Only those in uniform were real and solid ; civilians had become shadows confronted with a war which , from having been across oceans , suddenly surrounded them . Mama made no effort to check her tears . Eddie , with his arm tight about her , kept looking down , kept opening his mouth to say something ; but no words came . The crowd along the platform stirred , quickened into life , and travelers began to get on the train . " Well , Mama ? " Eddie dropped his arm from her shoulders ? " I better be going aboard , I guess . It 's time . " Mama caught at his sleeve . " It went too fast , ' she said , " it went too fast . Eddie , I feel like I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissed her hard . Awkwardly he kissed Loraine 's cheek and shook Papa 's hand , and then swung lightly up on the steps , just as the train started to move . Mama and Papa stood where they were , looking at the slow wheels , as if they could not bear a last glance at Eddie himself ; but Loraine found herself running beside the train , keeping pace with the end of the coach where Eddie stood . Hewas surrounded by other sailors : they clotted at the top of the steps , half a dozen of them , leaning on one another , waving their hands , whistling at Loraine as she ran faster to keep up with them . " Boy , " one of them said , " these Michigan dames . . . " " Eddie , " Loraine said breathlessly . " Eddie , take care of yourself . " Suddenly he smiled , widely and radiantly . With one hand he adjusted the angle of his hat . He looked the way he had years ago , gay and confident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , after the train had vanished down the tracks , that seemed almost worse to Loraine than anything else . The Boys in the Denver Station A BITTER day a while ago I saw several companies of Negro infantrymen in steel helmets being exercised between trains at the Denver Union Station . It was frightfully cold . One platoon started not a count but a chant : one-two-three-four , another took up one-two-threefour , another one-two-three-four , another one-two-three-four , all in the same cadence , heels hitting the pavement as one , but with the strangest syncopation , the most beautiful variation of tone levels . More than a marching chant , it was a hymn of sorts to be heard but once . Next time it would be different . I wished for Bach , for Gershwin , for Vachel Lindsay , for Stephen Collins Foster . I wondered what would have happened to the New World Symphony if Dvorak had heard it . I did n't like to think of those American boys going off to war , but if wars must be there are international interchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed . I thought of slave ships , the war between the States , the bootblack dancing for a nickel on the Barbary Coast , and out of it a tempo , a rhythm , almost a culture for America , some curious poetic justice that had broken slave chains and given free men a new voice . Africa , if they were going there , I thought , could still be much bewildered by what time had done to something America was giving back , not knowing what she had borrowed .
