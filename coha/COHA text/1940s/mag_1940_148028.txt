There are more Baptists-10,000,000 , black &; white-in the U. S. than there are Protestants of any other persuasion , and they do not like the Roman Catholic Church . Last week Baptists were the quickest and loudest of protesters against President Roosevelt 's Christmas Eve appointment of Myron C. Taylor as ambassador to visit the Pope . Technically Mr. Taylor is not Ambassador to the Vatican , for Congress has not created any such post . This particularly stirred the Baptists . <P> The Rev. Louie D. Newton , pastor of Atlanta 's big Druid Hills Baptist Church , publicly addressed six questions to Mr. Roosevelt , suggesting that the President was trying to put something over on Congress , the Constitution , the people . In Washington , representatives of Northern , Southern and Negro Baptists drafted a letter to the White House ( text not released ) , which they said praised Mr. Roosevelt 's peace efforts but deplored the appointment of Mr. Taylor . Last week Christian Century , non-sectarian but Baptist in sympathy , bluntly editorialized : <P> " To strip away all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic relations with the Vatican without legal authority . He has done so , we believe , not as a peace move but as a political move . . . . The American majority does not want to see relations established between this Government and any religious body , and it will hold Mr. Roosevelt responsible for having tried to do this under the nearly sacrosanct cover of a campaign for peace . . . . In every respect . . . the dispatch of Mr. Taylor to the Vatican is of ill omen to the neutrality and religious freedom of the U. S. "
