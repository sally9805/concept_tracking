txt Counsel for Alger Hiss unveiled a new defense yesterday at his second Federal perjury trial by contending that Henry Julian Wadleigh , rather than Mr. Hiss , was the individual who gave State Department secret papers to ConImunist agents in Washington . Claude B. Cross , 56-year-old Boston attorney , said that his client had never given secret doc , uments to Whittaker Chambers , self-confessed courier for a Cornmunist spy ring ; from 1934 to 1937 . As the Hiss re-trial gained impetus on its second day , Mr. Chambers again took  --  the stand to tell his story of an espionage relationship with Mr. Hiss in pre-war Washington . In addition to naming Mr. Wad- Leigh as the document source , Mr. Cross said the jury must consider whether Mr. Chambers had " a pipeline from the Far Eastern Division of the State Department . " Mr. Cross Old the jury of eight women and four men that it was Mr. . Wadleigh , not ' Mr. Hiss , who gave Mr. chambers the microfilms hidden in the Chambers pumpkin patch at Westminster , Md @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a confederate " typed copies on the old Woodstock typewriter formerly ' owned by the Hisses . The defense attorney contended that Mr. Chambers could easily trace and acquire the Hiss typewriter after the Hisses had given it to servants . The new defense constituted the high point of the trial session yesterday before Federal Judge , Henry W. Goddard in United States , I District Court . 1 In the first trial the defenne , headed by Lloyd Paul Stryker , had , contended merely that Mr. Hiss had not furnished the documents . Mr. Wadleigh , a former State De-1 partment economist , testified at , the first trial that from 1934 to i 1936 he abstracted secret documents from the Trade Agreement Division and gave them to Mr. Chambers for transmission ' .06 al Russian spy ring . Mr. Chambers testified that none ' of the forty-seven documents that were Government exhibits had been given to him by Mr. Wad- , Leigh . Mr. Wadleigh also testified that he had never copied documents in typing or handwriting . Mr. Hiss is on trial on two counts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Federal grand jury last December that he never gave documents to Mr. Chambers , and never saw Mr. Chambers after Jan. 1 , 1937 . Passport Lie Laid to Chambers - In another new development the Hiss defense charged that Mr. Chambers had falsified a passport application in June ; 1935 , when he sought to travel to Germany on the North German Lloyd liner Stuttgart . Mr. Cross told the jury that Mr. Chambers had falsely described himself as a " free-lance writer " when he applied for the ? passport under the name of David Breen . " David Breen died at the age of 3 ; i , " the defense attorney said.I was ghoulish of Chambers to te .. ) ke to the State Department the birth certificate of a dead child for a passport issued on May 31 , 1935 . " Chambers gave false dates for his father 's birth and his death . He submitted a photograph with a , bushy mustache , one ? of the few which show him with a mustache . His corroborating witness did n't live where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said he had known Chambers for seven years . And Chambers , a Communist agent , swore to uphold the Constitution lof the United States . " On the Government side , Thomas F. Murphy , Assistant United States Attorney , succeeded in amplifying the Chambers first-trial testimony against Mr. Hiss , the 45-year-old former State Department functionary . Mr. Chambers took the witness stand at 3:04 P. M. , once more prepared to carry the brunt of the Government 's case . He followed technical witnesses who testified to the Hiss testimony before the grand jury that indicted him for perjury on Dec. 15 , 1948 . In the first trial Judge Samuel H. Kaufman upheld a defense objection to Mr. Chambers identifying J. Peters and Harold Ware . Tells of Meeting Hiss Yesterday Mr. Chambers testi-fied : " I met Alger Hiss in June or July of 1924 in a restaurant in downtown Washington , where I was introduced to him by Harold Ware and J. Peters . J. Peters , also known as Alexander Stevens , was the head of the whole Communist , party underground in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ella Reed Bloor , Mother Bloor , ' a well-known Communist leader . " J. Peters said Alger Hiss was to be disconnected from his apparatus to become a member of a parallel organization which I was then orgpni7ing That was the principal point and all I really recollect about the conversation . I met Hiss two or three weeks later in his home with Mrs. Hiss . I never went to any office of Hiss . " Hiss said that as counsel of ; the Nye Committee he had opportunity to obtain confidential documents from the State Department ' and asked if I wanted them . After consulting with J. Peters I told Hiss to bring out the documents , and I did receive them . I photo-1 graphed them and returned them , to him . " Before the parade of witnesses , began Mr. Cross had opened for the defense in one hour and seventeen minutes and Mr. Murphy took one hour to open for the Government . Through the rip-tides of accusation and defense , Mr. Hiss and his wife , Priscilla , sat impassive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs of opposing counsel , but watched the faces in the jury box intently . At 4:08 Judge Goddard adjourned the trial until 10:30 on Monday morning .
