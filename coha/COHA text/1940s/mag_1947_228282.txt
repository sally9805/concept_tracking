To prove pregnancy in its early stages , obstetricians generally use a simple urine test . In the Aschheim-Zondek test , they inject a female mouse with a urine specimen ; in the Friedman test ( faster and easier to read ) , a virgin doe rabbit gets the injection . If the patient is pregnant , hormones in the urine produce easily detectable changes in the animal 's ovaries . The Friedman test , which takes two days to complete , can spot pregnancy with 98% accuracy* ten days after the first missed period . <P> Last week , a University of California researcher reported that he had discovered a new blood test for pregnancy . Dr. Ernest W. Page , an obstetrics professor , claimed that his new test had three important advantages : 1 ) it is faster ; 2 ) it can determine the date of conception within a five-day margin of error , thus forecasting more accurately when the baby will be born ; and 3 ) it provides a continuous check throughout pregnancy on whether the fetus is still alive . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an enzyme found in a pregnant woman 's blood . Pitocinase neutralizes pitocin , a mysterious pituitary hormone which seems to play a part in contracting the muscles of the uterus . As pregnancy advances , the amount of pitocinase in the blood increases at an exactly predictable rate . By measuring the concentration of pitocinase , Page determines the stage of pregnancy . His measurement method : a strip of uterus from an elderly female rat is suspended in a solution containing pitocin and a patient 's blood sample . If the patient 's blood lacks pitocinase , the pitocin-stimulated uterus contracts vigorously . But if the patient is pregnant , contractions are weaker ; they vary according to the amount of pitocinase present . An abortion or death of an embryo is detectable by a drop in the amount of pitocinase . <P> In the fourth week of pregnancy , Page 's test takes 18 hours ; after 16 weeks , it takes only 15 minutes . In trials on 52 women , he says the test has thus far failed only once . <P> * For another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
