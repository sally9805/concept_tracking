 | Gordy abruptly realized every man of the five brand owners in the room was against him . He looked around slowly , pulling his body together as if girding himself . Castro said : " A man called Strant  --  sometimes known as the Silver Kid  --  will be coming into the Pothole . " Castro liked to drop a blow like that , delayed , calm and casual . Gordy puffed out his chest . " What do we care ! Me , I ai n't taking crow from no fancy gun-slick or ? " " Strant , " said Castro . " Solo Strant . . . . Less than three weeks ago , George Grew , Eben 's brother , got loose-lipped on a few drinks over in Garson . He said they knew this Strant , an old friend , and that if things got too tough , they 'd be sending word to him and he 'd come . Well , Gordy , you made things too tough . " Gordy guffawed around . " Certain jaspers sure run short on nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope in and  --  if this Strant ... " And suddenly he remembered and understood who this Solo Strant was . " This Strant  --  uh  --  the one who brands a man with a bullet and ? " John Castro nodded and Barrat tucked his head down into fat folds of his chin to indicate assent too . Gordy sucked wind and his eyes shot out one  | of the windows of the dobie Spanish style place . He was thinking of his men he had left outside , his trigger-slammers . Then he realized he was staring into the patio instead of out toward the gate where an Anchor-T hand was on guard . Gordy made a pass at his face that was slick with sweat . He knew who the Silver Kid , this Strant , was , though he had never met him ; knew he was one of the deadliest manhunters the whole Southwest had ever known . Tamp Gordy felt terribly alone , terribly desperate ; he leaped to his feet . " I 'll go ? " he started hoarsely . Castro said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing , throw yourself on the mercy of the law . ' We 'll promise to do our best to snake you out of jail  --  later . . . . Do that and maybe things will cool off . George Grew might be satisfied , and this Strant might slope along . " Gordy 's unhinged jaw slowly closed up and a sly look came into his eyes . A man bred to violence , he was thinking in the only terms he knew how ? in terms of a gun . " I 'll go sec George Grew myself and ? " " Sit down ! " Castro commanded , propping his elbows on the edge of the table behind which he sat . Only that time his order was ignored . " I told you what you can do . It 's too late to see George .  | He 'll already have sent word to Strant and ? " Gordy made a quick jump toward the end of the sofa on which the massive Tuck Barrat sat . He was thus in a position where he commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . He roared back at Castro , lips wrenching in rage . " I 'll blow a window in that fool George 's head ? then he wo n't be around to tell nobody nothing ! " he bellowed . He slapped a hand to the hogleg on his thigh , half dragged it , and moved toward the door . The danger signal came : the blink of Castro 's crescents of eyes , that was all . Gordy caught it and cocked the hammer as he swiveled up the scabbard . He was a split second too tardy . Castro 's hand came up out of the drawer in the table that he had opened silently . The blue-black Colt barrel spearing from his hand swung across the gleaming table surface ; then smoke was forming a lopsided halo about its muzzle , and the room seemed to vibrate with the thunder of the report . There was a second one , a couple of seconds later , like an ineffectual echo . It was Gordy 's still holstered weapon speaking as he broke in half and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmlessly . Somebody said , " Holy Gawd Almighty ! " The  | couch springs creaked with relief and Tuck Barrat had his vast body on his feet with a Colt like a toy in the pudgy mass of his hand . Anderson , long poles of legs spread stiffly , stared down at the dead Gordy , looking as if he could n't believe it . Then stocky Nels Antrade , the fifth big brand owner present , spoke up . He had a dry whisper of a voice as the result of an old bullet wound in his red neck that had affected his throat . " That was right brutal , John . . . . You had to kill him ? " All eyes swiveled to Castro ; he slid the drawer closed . The gun was already back in it . " " That 's that . Now we can get down to business .. . . "  | Castro had never risen from his seat . Imperturbable , he plucked a black cigaro from a box on the table , bit off the end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind soughed and a pony nickered down in the corral . The acrid gunpowder smoke drifted by one of the lamps in serpentine undulation . Pole Johnson slapped at it with a hand as he stood scowling at Castro . Castro met his stare as if he were a schoolteacher confronted with a stupid pupil . " Gordy had no sense . His breed can only think in terms of cartridges ; he would n't listen to reason . Or maybe you gents like the idea of this devil Strant setting his sights for the Pothole ? " Pole did n't reply ; his look just blackened . The spell was still unbroken . It was as if they were puppets and Castro pulled the strings when he wanted them to jump . Behind him , against the wall , the lounging Eberly crossed his feet the other way and let a hand drop down from beneath the lapel of his coat . He was a tall man with a long nose and eyes  | that always seemed to be looking slaunchways around it . He was supposed to be Castro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideward through his cigar smoke , not at Eberly but at the pot-bellied man with the ragged gray hair over by one of the doors . He was Billy Taber . When he caught anybody looking at him , he smiled quickly , briefly . He had a withered left arm that dangled uselessly at his side , had a trick of walking with his right shoulder and side thrust forward as if to hide the withered arm . On his right leg he had a loose-sagging holster , topless , with the ivory-decorated butt of his gun projecting . Nobody paid much attention to him . The story was that he was an old friend for whom Castro felt sorry , a useless pensioner . " Get him out of here , " Castro told Billy Taber , " and tell the woman to conic in and mop up the blood . That stuff can make a nasty stain . " He looked at the four other brand owners . " Gordy 's body 'll be found down the trail . Let ' cm make what they can of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the spell seemed to snap . Castro told the woman to bring them a bottle of whiskey and some glasses . Big Pole Johnson walked around , still glowering moodily . The stocky Antrade put a match to his quirly ,  | tossed the match at a corner , and pushed his long yellow hair off his forehead . It reached over his eyebrows when it fell downward . " Well ? " Castro said to him . In his quiet-spoken way he always carried the attack to the other man . Antrade was bothered . He was an ex-outlaw , and as a result of his long-rider days he retained a twisted sense of loyalty . Men outside the law , a bunch , had to stand together against the world . He spoke around the brown paper tube , putting it into whispered words . " Gordy was one of the band , " he put it . " He 'd worked with us before ; he made a mistake , but ? " What he was thinking was that if Castro dared to blast down Gordy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut down another of them if he thought it a good idea . Over on the couch Tuck Barrat cleared his throat . " Gordy brought trouble on us . Bad . He 'd have brung more . What 're you spilling over about , huh ? " He still held the gun dwarfed in his hand . " Yeah , he played it wrong , but he was one of us . " Barrat spat into a cuspidor and his three chins quivered . " Was ' is correct , Antrade . Or are you prodding to bust a cap on somebody over him ? If you 're calling for a ? "  | Antrade 's whisper of a voice was sharp as wire . " When I call  --  you 'll know , Barrat . You nor nobody 'll need to ask me , I 'll make my purpose clear as a skunk on a hot night . " " A lot of windying ai n't goin ' to help now , " Pole Johnson put in . " Maybe ? " " Shut up , " Barrat said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes remained locked on the stocky red-headed Antrade . " You do a heap of barking , Nels Antrade . Mebbe you 'll take care of this Strant when he comes horning in . " Antrade spread his hands in front of the wide shell belt with the silver buckle at his middle , hooked them in it . " I ai n't aiming to get my boots round-heeled from sidestepping when him or any hombre fronts me . " Barrat made a nasty laughing sound and chewed his pendulous lower lip with his teeth . " This Strant is big poison , Antrade . He do n't go chasing twobit stuff like . . . " He capped it with another laugh . Antrade pulled his red lips back from his teeth . " Always laugh when you say things like that , Fat ! Then you 'll live longer ! " The pink of Tuck Barrat 's great face became a dirty jaundiced color . " Giving me orders ? " He had once broken the arm of a man who called him " Fatty. "  | Antrade shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounging behind the smoke of his cigar and everybody knew his eyes were smiling . He 'd pick up the reins when he felt ready to . Antrade snapped ash off his cigarette stub . " Seems like you think you 're giving the orders hereabouts . . . . The Mexicans got a saying that if a hairpin goes around waving a knife long enough , he 'll taste a blade sooner or later himself . You ought a write that down , Barrat . " Ring Anderson drawled , " Nice debating society we got all of a sudden . Now I heard it told how this Mr. Strant does a heap of his talking with lead . " Castro picked it up , laughing . " That 's right . Let 's get down to it , gents . It 's too late to do anything about George Grew . He 'll have already sent word to this Strant . From what he let drop he seemed to know where to reach him . " There was no talk for a few moments . Pole Johnson swallowed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cicadas hummed on the night and off over the ragged Superstition Hills a moon shoved its sharp bluish horns into view . Seated again , Nels Antrade pulled his eyes from the still damp brownish spot on the floor that had been Gordy 's blood . " There 's five of us here now . We represent quite  | a chunk of hands who know from experience why a hammer 's been rigged on a shooting iron , and a trigger too , " Antrade said . " This Strant might be a lead-spitting hellion , but they 's only one of him . " Castro shook his head . " We might get him , though it 's been tried aplenty before . There are some who claim he can smell trouble coming . He ? " Banat scratched a lump of his bulbous body under his checkered shirt front . " Price 'd be high , but maybe we could buy him off . " Castro 's lips thinned . He was n't used to being interrupted . " If this Silver Kid has a price , Tuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever offered . Nope . Once he cuts a man 's sign and takes the guntrail , he do n't quit till he 's hung the deadwood on said hombre . I lc totes his own law on his hip , Colonel Colt , and the only thing else that 's ever been needed is a spade  --  for the other fella . " Anderson spoke up again , stroking his black bar of mustache . " Aw , shucks ! I 'm out there at my place with a purty good spread . If a waddy comes a-hunting me with them around , he 's got a right good chance of riding to blazes on a shutter . If he gets me fust , that 's my hard luck . " He lazily smothered a yawn . Castro sneered in irritation . Turning from the  | window , Pole Johnson saved him from talking that time . " It 's like we were saying before  --  before Gordy came . This Strant hombre , he starts poking aound in the Pothole and Gawd alone knows what he 'll uncover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castro waited , studying them . He gestured toward the bottle and everybody but Pole refilled his glass . Barrat looked down from an oil of an Indian 's head on the dobie wall . " Maybe we could buy out the gunmen with him . " " No chance . They call him ' Solo ' because he operates alone . " Castro rose and sauntered around the table , humming idly . They had discussed it before the late Tamp Gordy 's arrival . They all knew how dangerous and deadly this Strant man was . His rep had reached the Pothole country long before this . They knew what they were up against . Castro waited for their patience to wear out and ask him the answer . Antrade pinched out another brown-papered quirly . " Well , it looks like we ai n't got no choice . We got guns ; when he comes in we can try to smoke him down . Then ? " " Sure . " There was a deep sneer in Castro 's tones as he leaned against the front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks in the Pothole will be banding  | up in posses and Vigilante bunches and going haywire . A whole herd of John Laws will come a-busting in , not even waiting to be sent . Most likely a small regiment of U. S. marshals will be dispatched this way pronto prontito . And you can bet twenty dollar goldpieces to dobie dollars the governor would assign every last special officer he 's got to the Pothole . This Silver Kid is beloved by many folks , and he 's respected by a heap more . . . . Now , you want that , a whole county and half a state hunting us to our holes ? " " Well , what do we do then ? " Antrade asked sullenly . " Yeah , what , Castro ? " Pole Johnson seconded him . Castro studied his cigar tip . " Times are changing . We five  --  we 've been running and using the Pothole as we sec fit . We want to keep things that way . The railroad 's driving a spur down to Garson City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to get our hands into . " Johnson frowned . " I thought you said we might give the railroad trouble when it turned into the west valley . " " New times , new times , " Castro said . " You fellas got to wake up . What we been gettin ' is mere sweat off a mule 's rump compared to what there 'll be in  | the pot for smart men like us when Garson City gets really big . That is , provided " ? he stabbed his cigaro at them ? " we handle this situation smart and do n't get people riled so their resentment fires up into bloody action . In other words , we do n't want any big clean-up of the Pothole ! " Antrade brushed yellow hair off his forehead again . " You running for political office , John ? " Castro shrugged . " So we do n't kill this Kid , Strant , when he slopes in . We do n't do anything to him . We leave him strictly alone . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water over them all . Tuck Barrat 's body quivered all over as he tried to hoist himself from the couch he dented . " Maybe he should be my house guest , eh ? " And behind Castro , Billy Taber 's face dropped open in a silent choking , gasping grimace . Castro crushed out his smoke in a saucer that served as an ashtray . " No . We let the almighty holy law take care of him . . . . And it 's going to be hot on his coat tails , singeing the tail feathers off him . " Castro enjoyed the shock his words produced . The law after the famed Silver Kid ? Solo Strant a wanted man ? They could n't believe it . " I guarantee the law will be hard after him . " Castro was talking again . He picked up the whiskey bottle and took a slug from the neck without benefit  | of glass . Then he put it down quickly , remembering that it was a secret he had started life as a swamper in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering that he was a gentleman-rancher now . " I guarantee it . Listen . I 've been checking back on this Kid for about two months . That 's when I first heard George Grew mention that he was a friend of this Kid 's and that it might be about time to have the Kid pay a visit to the Pothole . I 've been busy learning things about this Kid since then . " Castro resumed his scat behind the table , dropped his voice a notch and talked faster . He had been checking through many sources , and he had a pile of information on the Silver Kid ; what he looked like . . . . A half-pint , boyish-faced , with sleepy eyes and black hair . Soft-voiced . Always wore black , rusty and trailworn . And how he got his name from his silver trappings . He wore a double row of silver buttons on his shirt , Castro said . Had silver spurs . His gun butts were silver , and there was a small silver skull joining his sombrero strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button down hard on his luck and a long time on the grub trail , " Castro said . " Gents always underestimate him the first time they clap eyes on him . But he 's a walking son of Satan  | himself when he swings the hardware into action . A dead shot and nerves of ice  --  or steel . Some differ on that . Reckless  --  yet somehow never locoed , when he goes into action . . . . " He talked more . He had unearthed details of this Kid 's past . Castro began to sum up . " Strant 's a peculiar one . He ca n't be scared and he ca n't be bought out . He 's got one mania  --  that for fair play . He 'll draw chips to sit in with an underdog in a lost cause at the drop of a hat . And he hates to kill . He 's got a trick of marking a man with a bullet first in warning .... Putting his bullet brand on a man , they call it ... When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ring Anderson stretched his boots and broke it with : " Well , it 's nice knowing all about the hairpin who 's coming to kill me . " Castro said , " I 've got two men lined up . . . deadly gunslingers . . . killers . . . they can be hired . They 're both small and slight , black-haired , like this Kid . Dressed in black with the silver trappings , they could pass for him if they wanted to . " Tuck Barrat caught it first . " We can hire ' em ? " he snorted , heaving up . " Then they ? " " I 've already got ' em under hire . They drift into the Pothole separately , each one passing himself  | off as this Solo Strant . Gentlemen , Strant 's going to have a new rep , one laid in advance for him . By the time Brothers and Toe Gotch ? " " Them are the two ? " " Brothers ? " Ring Anderson sort of coughed the word as he stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , sideways toward John Castro . It showed the profile of his whole flat tall body , flat save for the thing that projected from his narrow back . It was neither a hump nor a deformity as the result of an accident . It was his right shoulder-blade , a freak of birth , oversized , the bone sticking out under his coat several inches like a fin . He said , " It 's risky , hit and miss . Maybe we ought a bring in Jus Lamotte and ? " He was shouted silent . " Not that slobberin ' coyote ! " " Sure it 'll work . This Strant 's never been in here . Folks will be fooled easy ! " " Them are the two , John ? " Castro nodded . " By the time they finish sowing the seed , Strant the Kid is going to he hated . His name will be anathema . When he rides in , he 'll find himself greeted with cocked guns and waiting hang-ropes ! " In the exultant uproar , Ring Anderson stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider had just dropped to all fours at the side of the brackish trickle of water in the bottom of the shallow crack of creek-bed that crossed the trail . His sombrero was off , on the red-baked earth beside him . He waved at the deer flies about his head , started to lower his face to the water to drink . Then the westering afternoon sun flickered briefly off polished metal , gun metal . A puff of the fetid breeze blowing across the prairie swells had stirred the foliage of the scrub some twenty yards back from the other bank of the creek , and before the leaves fluttered back into place the segment of gleaming gun barrel had been revealed . Strant 's reaction was hair-trigger quick . He kept his hands in view , away from his guns . Any move to draw would bring a slug from the unseen hairpin who had him dead-centered . Strant reared back slowly to his knees , then flung himself sideward at a little clump of stunted brush . The gun across the creek smashed out atop the whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baked mud just behind where Strant  | had been . He screamed an oath as if torn by the agony of a wound , huddled his black-clad body lower behind the hummock . A short-gun seemed to have grown in his right hand . He waited , playing dead . Tension-fraught moments crept by . High above , against the cloudless bowl of sky a rusty buzzard circled in a lazy eddy . Another puff of the hot breeze whisked alkali from the bend of the trail and drifted it down-creek over the hidden Kid . Somewhere off in the brown grass a sagehen rustled . Finally Strant risked a look , edging up one eye . There was only the blank wall of brush across the creek-bed . He waited a little more , ears alert for the crunch of an approaching boot on the caked mud . Then his second silver-stocked Colt whipped out and he sprang up behind the hummock . No swarm of bullets greeted him . Nothing . With his hat off , he blinked against the harsh sunlight . He leaped across the creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush , worked down to the point in the scrub where he had glimpsed the gleam of gun metal before . Nobody there ... . After a moment he picked up the imprint of boot heels leading away from the spot , followed them out beyond a string of scrawny cottonwoods into  | buffalo grass . Then there was no need to seek any further . Even as the beat of horse-hoofs carried to him he saw the rider whipping into the saddle on the run down at the bottom of the hollow . There was the flash of sparks from the shod hoofs on a stony bottom and horse and rider were swallowed in a little defile angling off to the south . A larger creek ran down it . Between the rocky bottom and the creek , Strant knew it would be futile to try to trail the bushwhacker down . " Some two-bit road agent bucking a string of bad luck , " he figured it as he returned to where he had been about to drink . He retrieved his hat , got his paint pony from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the leather to continue down the strip of dusty trail . It bent off to the northeast . His sleepy-looking eyes suddenly got even more heavy-lidded , and he found his fingers caressing the tiny silver skull slung at his throat on his sombrero strings . It had come into his head that that hombre had been no road agent , that it had been no ordinary holdup attempt . If he had , the other would have crossed the creek to rob him when he thought he had dropped him . Then he figured perhaps the drygulcher had mistaken him for somebody else as he came down the slope . But he recalled that he had pulled off his  | black hat some moments before he had stopped at the creek . In the bright sunshine the ambushed sniper must have had a good look at him . " Looks as if that gunny really aimed to put out my lights , " he mused . But that did n't make much sense . He was a stranger to this Pothole country , unknown ; he had just dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a score to settle with him yet . Still , if he had betrayed himself with a single sign of alarm or failed to jump as unexpectedly as he had at the creekside , the buzzards would already be pecking at his carcass . That brought to mind an incident earlier that day . Allowing himself little shuteye and catching brief bits of rest , he had been pushing himself hard since receiving that frantic note from old George Grew . That forenoon he had pulled up at a hoeman 's shack to get some grub . The quarter-section was worked by two brothers , both old , one crippled . When the lame one had first seen him riding up , he had taken one look , then ducked behind the barn . The other had burst , " Strant , " when he came to the door , then choked off and denied knowing the Kid a few moments later . Both had been furtive , timid , while he ate . And when he offered them pay for the food afterward they had acted dumbfounded.  | It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't accustomed to innocent hombres fearing him . He was still pondering on it late that afternoon as he sloped out of a gulch and bore down on the place at the crossroads . It was a weather-stained long dobie place beneath a big , half dead eucalpytus tree . Down at one end the dobie was hooked onto a two-story paintless old house . A sign , sunbleached and poking up from the weeds at the crossing like a derelict 's spar , read : " Solomon 's Oasis . . . Everything for Man and Beast . " The whole setup had a somnolent , innocuous air as the Kid left his pony by the tree and eased to the door . The sand of the path was blood-hued in the glow of the setting sun . Next to the door there was a paper sign reading , " Beds ? 25 cents . " Strant stepped by it into the dim interior and Solomon , the proprietor , came into the big main room from the back end . He was a little tub of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbing his hands . " Howdy , pilgrim , howdy . Make yourself easy . Irrigate the trail dust from your gullet . Light and split a bean . The weary rider is always welcome at Solomon 's ! " He waddled forward . " Rub and grain your hoss ? " Strant nodded , moving toward the long rudely  | made table that served as a makeshift bar at one side . Solomon whistled to the rear for his stableman . Gabbing away about the weather , he put a bottle and a glass before Strant , slapped at a cockroach that ventured on the counter , and fumbled his spectacles from a pocket beneath his flour-sack apron . He was extremely short-sighted . " Now what 'll you want for grub , pilgrim ? I can fix you up some ? " The one-eyed breed who 'd come around for the horse stuck his head in the front door , just out of curiosity . Then his single eyeball bulged from his head and his drowsy attitude vanished . That eye ran up and down the figure at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight , wasp-waisted body , the boyish sleepy-eyed face with the ragged black hair slipping over the forehead from beneath the warped black sombrero . " By grab ! " the breed breathed . His lone eye dropped to the newcomer 's feet . Spur rowels fashioned from Mex silver dollars . Batwing chaps fringed with silver conchas . There were the double shell belts with the silver-stocked guns , rigged butts forward for the famed crossarm draw . The black patched shirt with the double row of silver buttons . The hatband decorated with silver fixings , too . And then the other man 's hand went to his throat and the breed saw the well-known tiny  | silver skull slung on the chin strings of his sombrero . " Solo Strant . . . the Silver Kid ! " the breed said to himself tensely . He flashed a silent signal to Solomon , a sign they had to warn about a visitor . The Kid sensed the presence of somebody watching him and looked around . He had just jerked his fingers away from that skull suspended beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching of that skull was usually a sure-fire intimation of blood due on the moon , but it seemed senseless now . The man in the doorway , holding the bridle of the paint pony behind him , was bowing and grinning . When Solo turned back to Solomon , the latter had his glasses perched on his nose . For a moment , Solomon was stern , something akin to a vicious look in his weak eyes behind the thick lenses . Then he beamed again , licking his wet lips , rubbing his hands . He splashed another drink into the Kid 's glass . " First and last drink is always on the house at the Oasis ! Yes-siree , Bob ! Drink hearty , stranger . " He flashed a return sign to Crow , the breed . " Make yourself comfortable at a table , friend , and I 'll be rustling you some chow pronto prontito . " When the Kid stubbed out a quirly that he had smoked to a stub at the table by the other wall , he  | realized he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen that gave off the main room of the dobie . Then Solomon popped his head in another door and said something about having to get a fresh fire started for the steak . Solo nodded in the dying light , vaguely aware of the creak of an approaching wagon . He was thinking of that note from George Grew that had brought him hustling down into the Pothole . From the date on it he had seen that it had been almost three weeks catching up to him . Somewhere in its travels it had fallen into water . The ink had blurred . Between that and George 's hasty cramped writing , a good part of it had been illegible . The few facts Solo had been able to garner were that Eben , George 's brother , had been brutally murdered . That the killer had been one of a ring of big ranchers who dominated the Pothole . That all hell was due to pop with the outlaw element rodding the Law even up to the courts . And that any honest man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as ticketed for Boot Hill on a shutter . The Kid thought back . He could smell again the damp of the approaching storm the night in Dead Man 's Hole when he had fought to keep that lynchmad mob from the jail and the innocent jasper  | therein . Bulwarked by an outlaw bunch , they had been surging down the road and he could n't get his hot guns reloaded fast enough . And then Eben and George Grew had cut loose from the feed store on the corner , throwing in with him . They had kept on throwing down even when the rear of the place had been set afire . And the mob had finally been sent , broken , fleeing from the desert town . Solo had never forgotten how they had stood by him . Solo looked up , frowning . A door on his right led to a corridor to the house at one end of the adobe building ; muted sounds penetrated the door . A man started to call out over in the house , was abruptly silenced . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one-eyed breed shuffled in with a pot of java and a plate of slightly moldy bread . He could n't seem to keep his lone eye away from the silver butts jutting from the Kid 's hips . Before he went out , he lighted the lamp that hung a few feet from Solo Strant 's table but lighted no others . More time passed . The java was half cold and gray as gully wash . Solo called out and an unintelligible voice answered vaguely from the rear . Recalling the approaching wagon he 'd heard before , he  | strolled to a front window and stuck out his head . The wagon , a ranch buckboard , stood just at the turn on the trail eastward , team hitched to a roadside tree , no driver on the box . It was a strange place to halt . He went to the door and glanced up the trail to the north . A couple of riders were coming down it at a lazy trot . Some sixth sense made Solo wheel . Solomon was in the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar when the Kid sighted him , brought back the bottle of redeye and told him to help himself . Then he disappeared into the kitchen , closing the door after him . It had n't been closed before . Hungry , the Kid began to eat , trying to throw off the tense feeling that gripped him . He found himself looking at the single shelf behind the bar in the thin lamplight . Something was missing there . Then he knew . A Colt in a holster had been lying on that shelf before . It was gone now . His eyes swiveled out through the doorway to the gathering evening . The pair of riders were gone . Yet he knew they had n't passed or he would have heard them . Solo Strant had been in too many tights , had smoked his way clear of too many traps not to recognize the signs . His left hand came back across in front of his lean body as if on the recoil . One of his  | silver-butted hoglegs leaped up into view . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the cook shed hooked onto the back of the dobie structure . The shutters at that window had been closed when he entered . Now one of them swung slightly and revealed two inches of the ruddy , powdery dusk . Somebody had been there . A single bullet smashed from the muzzle of the Kid 's left-hand weapon even as the other gun from his left hip whipped up in his right hand . The chimney of the lamp hung from the ceiling shattered and the lamp itself came crashing down . Flaming gobs of oil spattered about . A slug screamed by the Kid 's head , nicking the brim of his sombrero dropped back on his shoulders . Another slicked a big sliver out of the top of the table . But he had sidled away from it . " Good gosh , he got wise ! " somebody bawled . And there was cursing from the back of the place as the Kid 's left gun thundered in two intermixed reports . He twisted toward the door framing the twilight , snap-shot at a dim body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The arm in the doorway twisted in pain . The gun from it rattled out of sight in the blackness of the floor . Solo had a split-second  | glimpse of the withdrawing hand , the rut running with blood across the back of it . Then the man was gone . Leaping forward , the Kid stomped out the little flames licking across the floor from the lamp . He blinked once in the sudden blackness , then was all right . He had eyes like a cat in the dark . In a few strides , he was at the front door and booting it shut and dropping the bar across behind it . He realized he had made them start the play before they were quite ready , before the jaws of the trap had been completely set . So his next move had to be swift , without pause , if he hoped to get out of there . A hoarse voice called orders from the tall grass out front . They had the place surrounded , he figured . Again one of his weapons crackled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raked through the open front window . He followed it quickly , jerking the shutters closed . Wheeling , he aimed unerringly in the dark and put lead through the door to the cook shed . The rattle of hastily retreating boots was the answer to that shot . " A hairpin in the shadow of a hangrope should n't let grass sprout under his boots , " he told himself . He was already moving toward the door that led to the wooden house at one end .  | When it swung open to the pressure of his boot , he was already sinking to his knees . But no hail of lead swept from the short hallway . Quietly he shut the door behind him and cat-footed it along the hall to the next door . They had n't had time to quite seal the ring about him . He eased open the second door , bent low , ears alert . It was the front room of the house before him . A table with a sombrero on it . A dully gleaming spitoon . Then an unsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a spur dragging on the stairs . " That you , Bucky ? " The voice was thick . " Yeah , " Solo gave him back . He had a gun muzzle covering the figure he made out dimly . The other man had a big Colt in one hand and was hastily tucking in his shirt-tail as he stepped off the stairs . He coughed and the reek of whiskey came across the room . " Solly , " said the other , " claims they got that Strant fella in the main place  --  got him all surrounded ! " He hiccoughed . " You know , that Silver Kid fella who went bad .... "  | Something like a cold steely finger ran down Strant 's backbone . . . . Who went bad . . . . The words seemed to hang in the darkness , to echo in the stentorian breathing of the man who 'd been sleeping off a drunk . There was a spatter of gunfire from out front ; they were trying to locate him in the main room . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bigger man 's ear . " Rusty ! Rusty ! " somebody called from the back , outside . A door into the room behind the front one scraped . " You there , Rusty ? " " Sure . " " For the lova Pete , get in that hallway and keep your gun hammer cocked ! That danged Kid jumped the play before we were ready . He 'll be trying to cut his way clear any moment ! " Rusty started to say , " Bucky 's here with ? " But the back door closed . " Come on , " he said to the Kid . " Look ! You light the lamp . Then if he comes this way , he 'll have to step into the light and ? "  | Solo thought quickly . " Turn on a light and he 'd never come this way  --  he 's too smart . You want to try to get him yourself , do n't you ? " The appeal to the other 's vanity worked . " You 're right as rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back  --  if I get a chance ! There 's nothing as low as a rat that turns ! " He probed forward and gripped the Kid 's shoulder clumsily in the blackness . " If we was face to face , Bucky , and he had me covered , I 'd still try to get him , even knowing I 'd die myself . Me , I might be called a horsethief and run off a few head o ' cattle at times , but  --  come on ! " He turned back at the entrance to the hall when the Kid failed to follow , wanted to know what was the matter . Again the Kid 's quick wits saved him . He muttered that he was going out back to get an axe . " Maybe I can cut a hole through the roof and force him out . " Rusty said it was a good idea and padded into the hallway crouched . There was a metallic click as he eared back the gun hammer . Solo found his way into the rear room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away a gun blurted muzzle flame through the dusk , the bullet pinging into that back shutter where he 'd first seen the man lurking . The shutter , dragging from one hinge now , was swinging wider .  | " He ai n't fired in some minutes in there , " a voice called softly . " Playing possum , the double-crosser ! " The Kid began to walk , not crouching or furtive ; that might be fatal . He had to seem like one of them , not a fugitive . He was gambling on the fact they would never believe he could walk out like this , right plumb through them . He moved toward the vague shape of the saddle-backed barn set out in the weeds of the rundown place , one gun dangling carelessly in his hand . And he was trying to dope out what it all meant , how they had come to think he , the Kid , had gone bad . " Where 're you going ? " An hombre on one knee behind a packing case looked over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axe . He 's going to get on the roof and chop a hole through . " " Never thought that whiskey-swilling galoot had that much sense . Say , wait a minute ? " Head outthrust , he peered at the Kid 's rig as he rose and came closer . Another man moved in from his right . Luck gave the Kid a break . A gent in the front slammed a bullet through a shutter there . It emerged from the shutters of the rear window of the dobie room . It seemed to those two as if the Kid himself had opened fire again from inside . They whirled ,  | dropping to cover ; one of them began to trigger . The Kid glided on toward the barn . The big , sagging doors were open . And just inside , reins looped over a post hook , stood the Kid 's own paint horse , still saddled up . He hit the hull on the hop , grabbed the bridle , wheeled the animal . He thought he had it all figured out now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten word he , Solo Strant , was headed in . And they had spread the story that he was an outlaw , a wanted man . Up in Rincon County the same thing had been tried against him once , his enemies even going so far as to slap counterfeit sheriff 's handbills around the trails declaring that he was wanted for a stage holdup . " If I could capture one of this pack and unbutton his lip to find out who ? " he was thinking as he started the paint out the double doors . He was poised to throw the spur steel to the horse the instant he was spotted . " And when I find out who ? " A figure came into the barn by a small door down from the main one . A man bore a lantern that he had been shielding with his hat . The golden rays spilled across the floor planks , sprayed up the flank of the Kid 's horse . The lantern-bearer took in everything in one glance . The Kid swung a gun on  | him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next instant he was bellowing the alarm . Solo bolted out of the place , but a luckily aimed slug followed him , caught up with him and just grazed him along the back of the skull beneath his hat in passing . At first he did n't even feel the blood spurting ; then all sound seemed to have stopped and he almost pitched from the hull as he unconsciously sawed on the reins . He had been creased , the skull shocked as if by a club blow . The man from behind the packing case leaped in his direction . Vainly Solo tried to hoist his gun level . His fingers seemed nerveless ; the advancing man faded from vision as if a wall had cut him off . But the Kid , struggling with an iron will , knew he was still coming , that he himself was losing consciousness . " They 'll burn you down like a mad dog . . . for a lobo , " he tried to tell himself . It was his deadly reputation that saved him . Clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spurs to the paint and managed to fire a couple of shots blindly . Two men leaped back for cover . The paint instinctively shied away from another who burst from the dimness . The Kid saw the clump of trees vaguely and drove into them . Luck was against him there . Inside of twenty  | yards they came up against a barbed wire fence that closed in a field . The sharp halt sent the Kid doubling over the saddle horn . He heard a crashing through the brush and tried to fire at it . The firing pin snapped on a hollow shell . Fumbling , battling to stiffen his body , he groped for the holstered weapon . Behind , the settling darkness was ripped by yelling and wild shots . Then there was the hollow thud of the hoofs of ponies being hustled over the barn floor . The Kid got the paint turned to the right and pushed along the fence . Nothing was too clear to him for some time after that . Vaguely , as something from a dream , he recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastward . He followed it , was flattened over the pony 's neck as some of those in front sent lead snarling at him . As he rounded a bend the cloppity-clop of pursuing horses came to him . It might have been all right . The paint was small , but a rugged , great-hearted pony that could take broken country or a trail at a hard gait and hold it . The Kid , even in his condition , might have been able to outdistance his hunters . All he had to do was keep himself in the saddle and hope no following bullet bore his name . A yellow globe of moon was climbing out of the  | cloudless south . Horse and rider galloped up a long slope between wooded banks . And a band of horsemen came over the crest of it from the other direction . " It 's the Silver Kid ! " bellowed a bull-voiced rider who had cut out of the woods onto the trail a hundred yards behind the Kid . There was no missing him with his silver trappings flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , saw them spreading out as they approached , then the glitter of their drawn weapons ; he saw several of them dropping to the ground to block his way . It was like trying to fight off an overwhelming desire to sleep , but he summoned his waning faculties out of that bottomless pit down which they drifted , steadied his right arm and sent a couple of slugs kicking dust about them . They parted and broke for the side slopes , and the Kid swung his pony and cut up one of the mud banks himself . Normally he would have been able to throw them off his trail , to have doubled back and chopped down a couple , perhaps , and cut through them . But now he could n't remember what was happening except in spasmodic snatches . It was as though a flickering light kept going on and off , off and on , inside his mind . He found himself riding hard down  | a steep hillside on a twisting faint path . There were no trees , even scrub growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the hill and winked like great fire-bugs on the night . Somehow he got into a gully , and it bent suddenly , sharply , to the north . He came to the end of it and seemed to snap out of a heavy dream . It was just in time to see a handful of horsemen slamming across the open plain toward the gully mouth . He had to turn back . He realized he was in a pincers , that the part of the bunch on his back-trail would come along any moment . And in his shape he would n't have a prayer of smoking his way through .  | A shape appeared , apparently out of the gully itself . Cursing through his teeth in a soft voice , he fought to steady his gun . The shape pushed by some brush as he wheeled his pony to drive right at it . There was the clicking of horns against the dried limbs , and then the gaunt steer , an old mosshorn , went lumbering down the gulch . Solo muttered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had appeared . A tiny defile , hidden by the scrub , angled off from the gully . Sandy-bottomed , it ran off only a scant ten yards to a dead end . But he was hidden . In there , he waited . It seemed as if he had been riding for a week of nights , as if the thing were endless . In his nigh helpless condition he tasted fear for one of the few times in his life . Fear and something akin to a berserk madness that churned fiercely inside him . He was being hunted , might be burned down , for something he had never done . The hoofbeats of the bunch coming in from the gully mouth drummed on the night . They went by  | the hidden defile , on up the gully . Pulling himself back in the saddle , the Kid started out and froze just in time , as a straggler hove in sight . The man 's pony limped . He halted and dropped down to inspect a foreleg . Precious moments passed , and he had hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two bunches meeting and discovering they did not have the Kid nailed bebetween them . Solo himself tried to follow the sandy patches as he urged the paint pony out of the gully . Things blotted out after that . Then he found himself riding hard along a hard-beaten cattle path in a great chaparral jungle . Like a stranger looking at another 's body , he became aware of a bullet hole in the right sleeve of his shirt . Then he realized they must have been close to him again . He became one with the black stalks , as high as the horse , that walled him in . Overhead , the moon was like a great orange blob in the sky , tinting everything with a golden effulgence . Then his gaze strayed to a mound off to the left . Beyond the range of a sixgun , a bunch of riders were silhouetted there . And he saw that the path through the impenetrable chaparral , that he was forced to follow , curved over toward them . He was trapped again . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over to his right . Riders were trailing over a piece of naked rock on an elevation , sombreros sticking conelike up at the moon . Then the Kid knew he was in a huge hollow , floored with the chaparral , and closed in by a horseshoe of low mounds of hills . A fork in the narrow path came into sight . It bore straight ahead , the right branch , instead of curving to the left . He took it only to discover inside of a couple of minutes that it angled sharply to the right . At a spot where the path dipped and the black stalks almost formed a tunnel roof over him , he dropped from the lathered pony . Leading it by the reins , he plunged into the thicket grimly , staggering like a drunkard . Thorns dug into his clothes , ripped his flesh . Hard sharp stalks snapped back and beat against his head . He thought if he ever got to water he might be able to pull himself out of the hazy depths which constantly threatened to engulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times he heard men shouting about him . A horseman up on the hills kept bawling directions , but even then the others down in the chaparral with him could n't find him . There was a small clearing in the forest of black stalks . The Kid halted , holding his breath , waiting . A man backed out of the thicket opposite him ,  | backed into the clearing . Solo Strant chopped down with his gun barrel over the other man 's sombrero . Then he worked by him , leading the horse , and followed the swathe the other had forced through the chaparral . He came to some water at last , a cold little spring that burbled out of some rocks just beyond the chaparral jungle . He doused the rip in the back of his head with cupped handfuls of it , drank some , then pressed some more against the back of his head . Feeling better , he remounted and moved along a meandering little dried-up creek bed . Off to the south he saw riders streaking from the chaparral , swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie wind carried a three-noted whistle , repeated twice in signal . The Kid smiled thinly . From a rise a little way back he had spotted the little cluster of dim lights of a town straight ahead . They thought they were drawing the net tighter , that he would n't dare enter the town . A guilty man would n't have . But the Kid was headed there , and there he would call for the showdown . Stronger , he thought briefly of that man who had fired in the front door at him , the hombre whose gun he had shot out of his hand , striping the back of his hand with the track of the bullet . That mark on a man 's  | gun hand was an omen of certain death , sooner or later . It had never failed yet . Strant wondered who the hombre was . The creek bed splayed out in a sandy spit studded with gaunt stark pines . The Kid pushed through the ghostly shadows beneath them and emerged in a clump of hovels at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he passed through a bare stretch in the full moonlight . He was coming in at right angles to the main street . From one end of it came the sharp spatter of hoofs closing in . He rode up to the back of a big place that was a barroom . The rear of it was black in the shadow of a huge eucalyptus , but a seam or so of light showed around drawn shades . He dropped off at the door , feeling himself steady , pushed at the door , and it gave . One gun drawn , he strode quickly into the glaring light of a back room where five men sat playing cards . They were so intent on the game that nobody looked up for a moment . He felt the bright lamplight spattering against his eyeballs , stinging them . He saw the huge flesh that was a man , saw him look up , kick out his chair and rise and drop a hand all in one smooth simultaneous motion . And then the man and the whole scene faded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurting glare in his eyes . Cold sweat burst from every pore of the Kid 's body . He knew . He turned his head slightly to each side , twisted his eyeballs around . But he might as well have been staring at a blank wall through a yellowish fog . That bullet crack across the back of his skull had done something to his optic nerves . He could n't see in the light . The room was clamped in a vise of silence . The Kid sucked his breath with the shock of it , forced his face into a sleepy grin . His mind kept shooting insistent messages to him , tocsins of terror . He fought them off , taking his nerve between his teeth , and spoke . " Can somebody here take me to the local John Law ? " Tuck Barrat 's chins trembled . He backed a stride and shifted sideward to get behind one of the seated players to use him as a partial shield at least . He had n't expected to die when he had sat in on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silent . All knew who the newcomer was , the deadly Strant . Then Barrat saw something . The Kid was still looking at where he had sat . Barrat lifted his left hand tremblingly  | and waved it back and forth . The Kid 's eyes failed to follow it . Then Tuck Barrat half guessed and smiled through the globules of sweat pimpling his face . " Sure , stranger . Sure , " he rumbled , walking around the table . " I 'll take you to the Justice of Peace right now . " He stood before the Kid . Barrat held his gun beside his leg but pointing at the Kid . The latter made no move because he could n't see the gun . Barrat knew he could plug him on the spot , could fill him with lead . Then he remembered John Castro 's warning . The success of their whole scheme rested on not one of them lifting a hand outwardly against the Kid . " Come along , stranger , " Barrat said , taking his arm gently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kid had glimpsed the door leading to the front of the building when he had stepped in . He half wheeled and let the other lead him , trying hard to conceal his blindness . The other 's rumbling voice was suave and friendly on the ear . Hinges squeaked and the din of a barroom flowed at him . The hand on his arm swung him forward . " Hey , Justice Dockins ! Justice Dockins ! " sang out the rumbling-voiced Tuck Barrat . " Here 's a gent to see you . Look , Dockins ! " It was abruptly still in the barroom , the chatter  | dying off . The Kid heard a sharp whistle of surprise . " I 'll be a ? " Justice Dockins leaped out from the bar , stared , paled for a moment . He saw Barrat lift his gun and hold it cocked an inch from the Kid 's side . Dockins came forward hesitantly , then quickly . He yanked a gun and slashed at the weapon hanging in the Kid 's relaxed arm , beating it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Kid 's belly it sent the wind wheezing from him . Dockins let out a triumphant roar . " The Silver Kid ! The dirty polecat who robbed Old Guffy 's store and murdered him ! My pris-oner ! "  | At that moment Solo Strant knew what it must feel like to get a knife in the back . It was all over now . He was a prisoner in the old little meeting house set off by itself on a branch of the main road at the end of town . Misery Flats was a small rundown range settlement down the trail from Garson City , the main town of the Pothole ; it had no regular jailhouse . The Kid sat on a rude cot in a small room at a back corner of the place over from the small platform . It had been built originally for the circuit rider who used to preach there when he made the rounds . The whole place had a dusty , unused smell . The door was blocked open . Through it came the glow of the lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kid could see only faintly in the indirect light . They had the door of the room open so they could keep watch on him , those two  | deputies down at the front of the little structure . They were vague figures to him , stolidly playing cards at a table , their Colts by their hands . Behind them the main double doors of the place were barred . The slow slap of the cards reached the Kid as he crouched , sweating steadily , trying to ward off the panic that threatened to stampede through his veins . For once in his career he would n't have given a dobie dollar or a plugged peso for his chances of getting out alive . The shouting and milling in the street stilled as Dockins ' voice rose from the steps . " I 'm rodding the Law in this bailiwick , so you might as well keep your danged shirts on , " he told them pompously . " Ever'thing 's going to be legal-like . Come tomorra morning , we 'll pick a jury right plumb here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see . The evidence will be presented . Amos Lott , I appoint you as counsel to represent the accused . Ever'thing legal-like ! " The angry muttering died , supplanted by a wave of laughter . Amos Lott , a broken-down doctor , was the town drunkard . When he got excited , his store teeth slipped and he could n't get out an intelligible word . He got excited whenever he had to stand up in front of folks .  | " A fair legal-like trial , " Dockins concluded . " And then we 'll hang the dog ! Now ever'body go home to bed . " Solo Strant could hear them tramping back up to the main road . The stillness crept back and the warm pulsing night seemed to seep into the meeting house . " Dampness is hitting the rheumatics in my joints , " said one of the deputy card players up front . The Kid squeezed his empty gun scabbards hard . He still could n't dope it out . When the justice of peace had hustled him out the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolstered by that pack that had been haunting him , Solo had asked about the charge . He had tried to tell them it was absurd . Somebody had slapped him hard over the mouth as they half ran along . Dockins had snorted at his protests of innocence . " You robbed Old Guffy 's store all right , Strant ! We know it . And then when he came down . the stairs and caught you in the act , you killed him ! " The array of evidence was overwhelming , according to Dockins , at least . A story had drifted into town that Strant had been involved in a stage holdup . Then the Kid himself had appeared , about two weeks before , Dockins said . He 'd gotten pretty  | orey-eyed and had a bitter argument with Old Guffy over changes in his store . That night the town had been awakened by gunshots . Three men had recognized the Kid when he burst out of Guffy 's and hit the saddle . Guffy had been found dead inside , his till robbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just like the one Solo himself wore now . That was Dockins ' story and he obviously believed it . " That skull is a-going to put your head in a noose , " he had grimly assured the Kid in the meeting house . " I never strung up a blinded man afore , but they 's always got ta be a fust time . " The convincing factor about their belief he was guilty was their contempt and loathing for him . Dockins , ordinarily a mild , contained man , had spat an oath and brushed off his hands when he had shoved the Kid into the temporary cell . It was like some insane dream . He knew he had never before visited Misery Flats . " And the way things stack up now , I 'll never leave here ? ' cept on a shutter , " he muttered . For the moment it almost made him forget that he was blind except in the dark . He leaped to his feet and started to pace , banging against one of the thin partitions he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputies turned and told him to be quiet . The Kid flung a curse at him , his nerves so raw and ragged they felt as if the skin had been peeled from over them . He had himself under some control when the deputy with the drooping mustache came to the doorway and lounged against it , shining his star with his sleeve . The other one , who had only been deputized for the night , stood lighting his pipe at the slightly opened front door and chatted with the guard who 'd been placed out on the steps in case of emergency . " You must 've been clean outa your head to come sashaying back into Misery , Strant , " the regular deputy drawled . " Yeah , " the Kid said , his voice listless . But his remaining senses were keenly alert , especially his hearing . He was trying to calculate exactly where the man was , how he stood , about where his hip gun might be . It was a hundred-to-one shot but the Kid 's only chance , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump his place when you walked in there . " " Yeah . . . . How about making me a quirly ? Sorta hard for me when I ca n't ... " " Sure . " The Kid held his breath , trying to time it . The  | deputy would have to take out the sack of makin 's , spill tobacco into the paper , thus tying up both hands , and . . . " Here ! " And the deputy shoved a cigarette between the Kid 's lips . The deputy smoked tailor-made quirlies . He warned Strant that he had him covered , then struck a match and lighted it for him . The Kid sucked deep and sagged back on the cot , just about whipped . " What happened to your eyes , Strant ? " The Kid shrugged . It hurt even to think about it , being blind save in the dark . It was worse than having a limb cut off ; living was n't so important any more . " Well , one thing . You wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornng , " the deputy offered for solace . The Kid 's face remained impassive , but his voice twisted bitterly from his lips . " Just like I never saw this town before ! " " Aw , Strant , that ai n't a-going to do you any good . I myself saw you when you busted out of Gully 's store that night just as I come in off the trail ! Or maybe you got a twin and do n't know it , huh ? " The Kid 's fingers twisted into the blanket of the cot . They all believed he had done it , which meant somebody had been here . . . somebody who looked  | a heap like him ... somebody impersonating him ? even to the skull ! " You got quite a chunk of dinero from Gully 's place , " the deputy said , " but you were n't packing none of it on you . Cache it somewheres ? " The Kid said nothing . " Too bad . Too danged bad , that money rotting away in a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you was free . You 're going to stretch rope and nobody 'll ever get that money . " The deputy looked over his shoulder back at his aide . Solo was looking sightlessly into the smoke from his quirly , not bothering to deny anything . The deputy went on , voice lowered . " Yeah , too bad . Now if you was n't blind  --  maybe you would n't have to hang . " The Kid gave no sign but he had n't missed the significance of it . Around them the aged building creaked in the growing chill of the night . The deputy 's boots scraped as he changed the position of his feet , tapping his tied-down holster softly . " Yep . Always had a grudge against that of skinflint , Guffy , since the time he cheated me outa fortyodd dollars . And as for Dockins , well , election for a new justice of the peace comes up next week . My brother , he 's runnin ' ' gainst Dockins . But if Dockins has the credit of stringing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a race . " The deputy coughed " Mind you , I ai n't saying nothin ' . " Strant caught on . " Suppose you do .... Suppose I told you that dinero was n't cached very far from here and that I could find it in a few minutes if l had somebody to tell me where I was going . " The deputy raised his voice , talking about the big rain they 'd had last week , and how it had washed away a few squatters ' shacks over by the creek . Then he spoke on in a minor key , tense and cautious . " Hid it right after you ducked out , huh ? So that 's why you was drifting back into these parts . . . . You could find it if  --  if I led you along and told you where you was going ? " " Maybe . . . . Of course , there 's a little matter of getting out of here , " Solo tacked on sarcastically . He did n't dare hope . " Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Kid heard him saying to the other one how a condemned hombre always got so thirsty his last night . He returned and bent over the Kid with a ladle of water and talked quickly . The special deputy had some pills the doc had given him when his rheumatism hit him bad . An opiate , they made him drowsy . " I 'll see he takes plenty of ' em . . . . And there 's a way out of the back of this joint . " He rattled the  | water pail . " There 's a little cellar under that platform and a door from it to the outside . " " I 'll want my own horse  --  and my guns . " The deputy nodded . He was n't worried about what a blind man would do with his hoglegs . The Kid was at his mercy , he figured . " I want half what 's in the cache .... "  | On his huge bay mare , Tuck Barrat was riding harder than he had in many a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal as he pushed across the rolling range north and east of Misery Flats . It was one of the few times in his life he had ever quit a card game before the last man cried enough . With three of his gunslinging hands strung out behind him , Barrat piled out of a little canyon and swung along the fence of the south pasture of Johnson 's Scissors outfit . He paused there , got dolefulfaced Pole Johnson , then continued on to John Castro 's big rancho . They came over the prairie swell that shielded the place from the west winds and drew up by the ranchyard gate . It was solid wood with a decorative arch over it , part of the veritable stockade that ringed Castro 's adobe range palace . Swinging down with surprising lightness , Barrat strode toward the gate , one wing of which was open a few feet . " It 's me , Tuck Barrat , " he called to the  | guard he knew would be lounging behind it . " I got big news for the boss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll cool your heels in that grass or they 'll be the part of your carcass that comes in first , " called back Eberly from inside the gate . " I 'll send word to the boss . " " Jumping kangaroos ! " boomed Barrat . " You know who I am ! When I tell John , he 'll gun-whip the pelt offa you . I 'm Barrat of the Bearpaw , blast you ! I ? " " That how you want it on your gravestone ? " Eberly sneered . Behind him a quirly burnt a hole in the dark and a vague figure shuffled out , right side pushed forward . " I 'll see the boss , Ebby , " Billy Taber said . " Dust ' em off with a slug if they get proddy . " Their raw arrogance had Barrat kicking holes in the ground . When Billy Taber came back with his meaningless smile and led them in to see Castro , Barrat was ready to bite holes in a fence . He blew off to Castro . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle bum with my hat in hand and ? " They were n't in the big living room but in a smaller one just around from the tunnel leading into the patio . Castro was meticulously dressed in gray , hair sleek as always , though the dawn was a1-  | ready striping the east . " Do you pay those men , Tuck ? " he interrupted quietly . " Why , no . But " I do . " The smile flickered in Castro 's crescents of eyes and he strolled over to a table and flicked at the insects buzzing over a lamp chimney . Behind , Tuck Barrat 's pink expanse of face went a dirty white . Castro said , " It 's one heck of an hour to get a man out of bed . Why ? " Barrat drew himself up and winked at Pole Johnson . " A few hours back , John , I put the Silver Kid under arrest . " Barrat enjoyed the shock it produced . For once he made Castro jump . " Holy Gawd almighty ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . Smiling , John studied Barrat , rubbing his mouth , and Barrat read what was behind that hand ; Castro thought he was lying . " You can come over to see him hung in the morning if you think it ai n't so , by grab ! They got him locked up and he 'll stretch rope come morning for the murder of Old Guffy ! " Castro nodded . " Yes . That Gotch fella did that job . " " Well , get saddled up and we can git back in time for the noose party , John ! " " Never thought it would work this slick , " Pole  | Johnson said for the third time . " Never thought it would ... " " Why should I want to see him hung ? " Castro inquired coldly . " We have no special interest in him  --  as far as anybody knows . " He frowned . " I 've got to get in touch with Gotch and Brothers pronto to tell them to lay off . Wo n't do for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Silver Kid with him now dead . " A gray-haired woman servant brought in a tray with a pot of coffee for Castro . He told her to bring some whiskey . Barrat and Johnson had a snort , but Castro took none , very precisely adding cream to his coffee over the back of a spoon until he had it the consistency he wished . Once he had seen a Mississippi River steamboat gambler who could speak French do that . " I 'd like to see him hang , " Barrat persisted . " I want to see if he cracks . . . . Wish I 'd had a chance to parley with him . Somehow  --  well , he must 've had some price . I 'd liked to have found out . " Castro said , " Sheriff Raye dang near put a bullet in Brothers when he was pulling that job up Leland Station way few days ago . . . . You know , when I made Levi Raye sheriff , he was a sick man . I never figured he 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that traveling medicine drummer pulled them two teeth of his that he got better , " Pole Johnson recalled . " Yes . " Castro sipped his coffee . " Perhaps we need a new man in the sheriff 's office . " " I still say I 'd like to see him hang , " Barrat went on , downing another slug of whiskey . " He ? " Castro eyed him as if he were nothing more than an annoying noise . " You 'd have shown a sight more sense if you had stayed in Misery to make certain nothing went wrong . That Kid 's a slippery one . Dammit to hell , I have to do all the thinking around here ! " When Castro saw them out , Tuck Barrat was a dirtier color than ever under his all-night beard stubble . He rammed his hat on his bald head and it slipped on the sweat there . At the gate , he halted before Eberly and surveyed him from spurs to sombrero crown and spat into the grass and strode out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Back in the dimness of the patio , Smiling John Castro went rigid and slipped a hand under the lapel of his frock coat . Then he swiveled his head slowly to the right . A shadow stirred faintly beneath the soft-rustling leaves of a pepper tree beside the arch that was another entrance to the house . Castro took  | a step over and made out the cloud of hair like sunscorched wheat above the black silken robe clinging to the woman 's body . " Diane , " he said . He tried to make his voice harsh but all the flatness was gone out of it . He went nearer . " You were spying on me ! You ? " Statue-like , her oval face smiling enigmatically , she continued to stare past him . Castro twisted and through the tunnel saw the long back of Pole Johnson vanishing out the gate . Castro swore and all his impassiveness was swept away . His face seemed to break up ; it was as if a mask had been torn off . " Blast you ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty little hussy , you ? " His words gagged his throat and his imperturbability was as absent as something uprooted by a tornado . " A very interesting man , Mr. Johnson , " Diane Castro said . She had a low , throaty voice ; always there was the hint of mocking laughter behind it . Always , at least , since Castro had brought her out to the Anchor-T . He stomped up and down , remembering that Johnson had been out in the patio alone a minute while he and Barrat had a final word . He wondered what had made Johnson accompany Barrat there that night , not realizing Tuck Barrat had kept his news a secret until inside .  | " Pole Johnson 's a poor man next to me ! " he spat , his voice shrill with a desperate note . " Why , he borrowed money at the bank just this week . " She looked at him finally . " No shooting tonight ? Everybody who came in walked out under their own power . " " What 're you driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sister , in town today . " " That dried-up old spinster ! Humph ! So ? Tamp was found back in the Superstition Hills . Everybody knows Jus Lamotte must 've cut him down . Lamotte kills like a wolf  --  for the fun of it ! " He stared at her . Her eyes were downcast , watching one slippered foot trace a pattern in the moisture of a flagstone . The creamy perfection of her wide forehead was bisected by twin lines running up from between her brows . She said , " Jus Lamotte . . . " " Your bedroom door was locked again tonight ! " Castro 's lips were hot and dry , and her breath came shortly . " That makes it dang nigh two months now . You ca n't still be sick ! You ? " " I never said I was sick . " " By Gawd , some night I 'll lock you outa the house , you stuck-up hussy ! Then you can bed down in the bunkhouse with those toughs I hire . "  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be men , anyway . " He drew back his fist , his eyes twisted in the sockets with the wildness of futility . She made a weary gesture as if it were an old scene to her . Then without apparent effort , she struck him solidly across the mouth . Castro stood as if rooted to the flagstones . She brought her hand back to pat down a little yawn . " Good night , Mr. Castro . Have Pole over again ? soon . " She entered the house . Castro went to the little room where he had met Barrat and Johnson . He picked up the whiskey bottle and held it to his mouth a long time . He looked at the glasses and swept them off the table . Then he sat down heavily , still holding the bottle . He wore a hounded look ... . The clumps of sage cast long distorted shadows as the low-slung moon paled in the waning night . Strant and the deputy used those shadows like rocks across a stream as they moved down the sandy slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , let 's go faster ! " the deputy said . He moved to one side and a little behind the Kid , steering him by the arm he gripped . Solo Strant stumbled , brushed against a jackpine.  | He recoiled as would a blindfolded man , then turned right into it again . " Dang ye ! This way , " the deputy whispered impatiently . The Kid 's silver-stocked weapons jutted from the holsters of his returned gunbelts . And the deputy , gnawing at his mustache end , kept a hand hooked loosely over the gun stuck in his waistband . Still , there was nothing to worry about with a man who could n't see . They moved along for another twenty minutes after they had picked up the Kid 's horse from the woods back of the livery lot . The Kid stumbled frequently , floundering around at every break in the ground . They moved in the shadow of the low sand ridge he had noted on his way in . " We passed that lightning-struck pine yet ? " he asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left . There was a new note in his voice now that they were away from lights and in the gloom . " Almost opposite it now , " the deputy said . " Where-at did you say you 'd cached the stuff ? " " Did n't say .... We go due north from here . " He shifted course , probing like an unseeing man , even though they were moving northward . " You did n't hide it in that old shack out here , huh ? "  | " We ought to be right near that now . " " Heck , that 's over this way ! " The deputy steered him across a stony dry-wash and around a jutting patch of mesquite . " Walk faster ! I wanta get back there ' fore they discover you 're missing if I can . I ? Say , if this is a trick I 'll ? " The abandoned shack appeared , a shell rising from a fringe of brush . " Where 's the stump near that shack ? " Solo asked . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't been at it- " " You cached it in the hollow stump ! " The greedy deputy lunged forward , dropping his hand from the Kid 's arm , releasing the reins of the Kid 's pony . He was n't even worried about the prisoner getting in a lucky shot blind with his guns because he had unloaded them . Chuckling , he dropped on his knees beside the stump . " By grab , now I 'll have that barroom I always aimed to open and ? " He would never open it on what he found there . A boot crunched in the sand and one of the Kid 's gun barrels smashed down and opened a slash in the deputy 's skull . The latter flopped soddenly over the stump like a man who 'd fallen asleep at prayer . The Kid drew the gun up closer to his face and spun the cartridge chamber . Not a shell was in it . " As I figured , " he said softly the while he swiftly  | reloaded . Before he swung up into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull from the chin strings of his black sombrero and dropped it in an inner pocket . In these parts now , he realized , that skull was a liability . Even as he wheeled the horse from behind the mesquite strip , a heavy-bellied black cloud slid across the face of the moon . From the west came the belching rumble of thunder . Rain  --  rain that would obliterate his tracks  --  was coming . He figured he had about two hours before daylight , two hours while he could still see ... .  | The rain was slanting in a monotonous pattern against the gray of the half born day when the Kid moved down the side of the wooded slope . Just below , back of a ragged track , red mud now , through the high grass , stood a ramshackle cabin . Behind it stood a small unpainted barn , one corner of it fallen in . If it had n't been for the handful of hens in a little run off to one side , Strant would have figured the place vacant . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place began to dim before his eyes in the growing light . Grimness drew his mouth into a harsh line . Finding a patch of thicket in the lee of an outcropping chunk of rock , he led the paint pony into it . Slipping off the kak , he picketed the pony there . Then he stole forward to the edge of the trees , straining his eyes , ears keened desperately . He had no other choice . With the arrival of daylight , he had to hunt a hole like a hounded animal . And a dark hole such as that barn would give him some chance of making a stand if a showdown came .  | Stumbling now because he was unable to see obstructions on the ground , he half probed his way through the rain to the back side of the barn . He edged to the corner of it and waited . But there was no outcry nor any sign from the cabin huddled out ahead . He worked back to the small door in the rear , pried it open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around and shifted noisily in its stall in the dimness of the interior . Patting its rump , the Kid quieted it and picked out the rickety ladder down at one end that led up to the exposed hayloft . He went over to it and hauled himself up , temples thudding with the driving blood at the effort . Dimly he realized he had a fever now . He dropped into the hay . The rattle of metal followed by the creak of a windlass roused him . At first he could n't place himself ; then he found his gun at his side in the moldy hay and crept to an aperture formed by a rotting board in the barn wall . A bearded man was busy getting a bucket of water from the well between the barn and the back door . Despite the rain , he was bareheaded and barefoot . He cranked up the bucket , spilled half of it down his pants leg , and stumbled back toward the door , swaying heavily . He was orey-eyed as a coot , Solo Strant realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully on the board outside the door . The Kid dozed off again , dreaming that he was backed against a wall with empty guns and facing half a dozen men who were spitting images of himself . Just as he himself did , they all wore silver skulls dangling at their throats and cleared their guns of leather with cross-arm draws . There was one false note about them but he was unable to put his finger on it . And all the time in the background was the deep laugh of the rumbling-voiced man who had led him to arrest when he 'd walked into that back room blind . He could remember little about him aside from that rumbling voice that growled out of his vast hulk . " Ai n't you seen nobody around here ? You 'd know that Silver Kid if he drifted in , would n't you , huh ? " " Aw , Frank , the drunken pig ai n't been seeing nothin ' but pink elephants and purple gila mon-sters ! " It was the flat crack of the slap that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his eye fixed to the crack . There were three men out at the well with the orey-eyed squatter , possemen from Misery Flats , the Kid guessed at once . One of them shoved the squatter 's head down into a fresh bucket  | of water , then hit him hard across the mouth again . They got nowhere . One of them started to poke around in the barn but left quickly when he saw the others head back for the cabin . Through the kitchen window the Kid watched the trio sampling the squatter 's jug of redeye . Then they left , riding down the reddish trail humped against the rain . The Kid became aware of a gnawing in his belly . As the rest of the bone chilling dreary day wore on , the Kid slept fitfully . Dusk came early and he stumbled his way up to where his pony was hidden with a couple of armfuls of hay . Then , as the gloom thickened , he risked slipping to the back door of the house . No lights showed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no response . He pushed into the kitchen . It was darker in there and he could see comparatively well . In the front room the squatter was sprawled half off and half on a Teton pole cot , snoring in a drunken stupor . The Kid made sure he had no hogleg on him , then returned to the kitchen . He found a stale chunk of Duch oven bread , some beans and jerked beef . Wolfing them down with cold water , he thought of his outfit that marked him wherever he went . Under a slicker on a nail in the wall he located a soiled flannel shirt out at one elbow . He stripped off his own black one with the  | twin row of silver buttons  --  later stowing it in his saddle roll  --  and pulled on the gray one . It was several sizes too big . After that he left a bill under the coffee pot on the table and went out . The rain had turned to a heavy slow-drifting mist . Getting to his pony , he rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing eastward once more . The night was a friend ; he had his eyes then . But he knew he had to put plenty of ground behind himself before morning ; then he would be helpless again . He rode hard , stopping only to give the paint a breather now and again . He came upon a stage trail curving to the northeast and followed it along a yellowish river . An hour later he waited in a grove of trees while a Concord coach rattled around a curve and past him . He passed a couple of ranch houses after the drizzle ceased , giving them a wide berth . The wind had died and it was getting warmer when he rounded a bend on the side of a low hill and almost rode smack into a cluster of buildings at a fork in the trail . They huddled in a shallow hollow . Down in it a door opened and light spilled across the road even as he studied it . A spiny , jagged finger ripped open the southern heavens and pronged lightning dyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it  | faded , Solo Strant sat rigid in the saddle , transfixed . He was like a man hit a crushing blow , stunned in his tracks , but not yet fallen . The lightning had blinded him temporarily again . Voices drifted up from the fork and he caught the beat of hoofs on the muddy trail . Hurriedly he blindly swung his pony over the bank on the left , sensed shale giving way under the animal . Vision came back slowly as if a fog thinned before his eyes . Ten yards beyond him , a small bridge in the road spanned a fast-running creek cutting down the hill . The Kid worked his pony beneath the bridge . Shortly the two riders came up the hill at a handlope . Dislodged earth from the bridge planks fell on Strant 's hat as they passed over it . They drew up , one of them scratching a match for his quirly . " Hell and tarnation , I 'd ' ve swore I saw a rider up here when that lightning flashed before , Bob ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice became cautious and tense . " Might 've been one of Jus Lamotte 's boys . They say he 's been around this way of late , him and his black mask .... " " That so ? " The first one 's discarded match floated down past the hidden Kid below . " That Lamotte 's a tough of coyote , ai n't he ? Times like it seems he do n't kill for money nor nothing  --  just  | for the heck of it ! You 'd think the Law would 've sent him to blazes on a shutter long time ago . " " It ai n't because they ai n't tried . They even sent U. S. marshals in after him . But Lamotte and his outfit fade back into them Superstition Hills and just seem to disappear . ' Sides , ai n't no one seen his face  --  with him a-wearing that mask  --  to help identify him . " " Well , " the first one took it up , " I sure could identify on sight that Silver Kid polecat who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would n't have no compunction ' bout shooting him in the back ! Lamotte 's a lobo through and through and always has been . But this Kid ? " " I know ! When a square man backin ' the Law turns , it stinks to heaven like a rotten carcass ... . That was awful , sticking up them two men and burning ' em down over at Leland Station ! In broad daylight , too ! " They talked that over as they forked their ponies away up the hill . The Kid donned his slicker before he emerged from beneath the bridge after having heard that remark about his outfit . Then he continued on his way , cutting around the settlement and taking the right fork below .  | Some hours later he was still speculating about it when the first roseate flush crept over the roundtopped hills to the east . He eased the pony down from the gallop at which he had been driving the animal . Time for him to hunt his hole again . The clammy hand of cold fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-mile he came to a long barnlike house on the bank of a wide stream . It was twostoried with a gallery across the front of it , and absolutely dark , the windows staring vacantly on the night . Then the weary Kid saw a ghostly figure , moving in the yard behind , disappear as the scrape of a closing door followed on the stillness . He dismounted in front and went up and hammered on the front door . To his surprise , it was swung open almost immediately by a gray-haired woman with a greasy man 's coat pulled across her skinny shoulders . The beady eyes in her gaunt big-nosed face wandered  | over the length of him so penetratingly he could almost feel them like a touch . Too late he saw that his slicker had caught back over a gun butt , revealing his rig beneath . Then she spoke in a thin nasal voice and her words almost floored him . " Come in , quick . He is n't here yet but . . . " She stepped aside , swinging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kid was thankful . He moved into the shabbily furnished parlor of the house , one of his spurs catching in the ragged carpet with the design of full-blossomed roses . The woman swore in a monotonous voice . " Should 've had more sense than to leave your horse out there in plain sight . Here ! This way , quick . Do n't act like you 've never been here before . " In the dim light , with her long , gliding strides , she moved like a spectre , went before him and opened a door off the back of the parlor beside a horsehair sofa with a spring projecting through the worn upholstery . He found himself in a neat bedroom with an iron bed with sheets and blankets and a patchwork counterpane . The woman flicked a lighted match to a candle in a saucer , then was gone like an apparition . The Kid promptly pinched out the candle as the door closed . He was still trying to figure it out when she was back , pushing her shawl-wrapped head inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be snooping around , " the Kid said . " Good , now you 're showing some sense . I put your horse up the trail behind those alders . " She pointed out the window as she went and pulled a blanket , rigged beside it , across the pane . " I 'll have you a mess of hot grub right off . He ought to be along any moment . " And she was gone again . The Kid was in a quandary . She seemed to know him , to have expected him . He did n't dare ask questions lest he expose himself . In a short spell , daylight would be there and he would be as helpless as a fresh-born dogie with its eyes as yet unopened . Still he wondered who this " he " was that she kept referring to . When she kicked open the door with a tray of hot food in her hands , light from a low-turned table lamp in the parlor flowed in . The Kid turned his side to it . She said that with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle . " I do n't know . Somebody might be skulking about . " " Maybe you 're right , Jus Lamotte and his bunch were seen down the line yesterday . Never can tell where that black-masked hellion will bob up next . That piece of steak big enough ? " After she was gone , the Kid lighted the candle  | and put it on the wash-stand in the far corner of the neat room behind him . Then he proceeded to dig into the steaming-hot food wolfishly . There was a pot of java and the steak and a big mess of fried potatoes overlaid with fried cackle berries . " Whoever she mistakes me for , " the Kid decided when he sat back and drew on a fresh-rolled quirly , " sure must be some pumpkins in these parts . I ? " He tensed as he caught the approach of horses . They halted a little way down from the house . The Kid doused the candle again and hefted out his hoglegs . Without the warning of a knock , the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a man 's voice , quiet , with a certain flat quality completely lacking in human warmth . It registered strikingly on the Kid . " He 's here . Got in a little while ago , " the woman said . " All right . Let 's have more light in here , Sadie . It feels like a wake , " the newcomer said . Behind the door , the Kid heard footsteps approaching the room . He realized this was the " he " the woman had referred to . And this newcomer had expected to meet him here . His elbow brushed a sombrero on a wall hook . He grabbed it and slapped it on , though he thought he had tossed his own  | black hat on the bed . The knob turned . Light , blinding light that would make him sightless , would follow . Boot heels rattled on the front steps . The Kid heard the woman curse the lights under her breath . The door burst open . " Hello ? " the new arrival sang out . " Levi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the door of the Kid 's room , whispered to the woman . " Howdy , sheriff ! What brings you down this way ? " Raye started to tell about tracking down a horsethief . The other cut him off with calculated curtness . " Fine business , chasing off after a chunkhead of a horsethief  --  and this Silver Kid , who 's gone bad , raising Cain all over the Pothole ! By Gawd , Raye , when I backed you for sheriff ? " The sheriff bucked . " Before you jump outa your pants I got some information about this so-called Silver Kid ! " " Yes ? The so-called ? ' Let 's talk this over , Levi . Come over here on the sofa ! No sense in yelling the news around . " Behind the door the Kid heard the sofa creak under them . " Now what about the Kid , Levi , my friend ? You know , I 'm always back of you . "  | " Well , over at Leland Station where I got a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Boss , that hairpin was n't the real Kid . " " What ? " said John Castro . " I know it do n't seem possible . He had the exact same rig and all . Just like him . But I saw the real Kid once , two-three years back . Up at Lincoln . It was right after he gunned it out with Rio Marfee . I was within a coupla feet of him and got a real good look at him . The killer over Leland was n't him , and I 'd swear my life on it . " " Levi , you must be mistaken . " " Nope . Nope . The Kid himself is dark-eyed . The jasper over at Leland had light blue eyes . I  --  hey , what 're you a-poking in my side ? Why , it 's a ? " The other man 's flat voice broke in gently . " Yes , Levi . You know too much . Sorry . " The Kid sensed what was coming . A man was going to murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he probed for the knob of the door , figuring he would slam his first slugs at the lights so he would be able to see , Levi Raye started to scream . On top of the scream came the thudding report of the gun , muffled by the doomed man 's clothes and body . The Kid pulled the door open . Before it was a  | few inches wide he saw the body scissoring over to the floor , the back of the killer , medium-sized . Two men were piling in the front door , bawling , " What 's wrong , boss ? " And the lights went out for the Kid , his eyes failing in the illumination . There was nothing he could do . He closed the door .  | Sadie entered the parlor , complaining shrilly . " Looks the blood all over my fine carpet ! It 's ruined  --  it 's ruined ! My carpet ? " " Shut down , woman ; I 'll pay for a new one . Get him out of here , boys , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get the lights off , Sadie . " The Kid heard their boots clatter down the front steps . He started to open the door again . But the skinny woman came loping in with a lamp and a bucket of water to clean up the spot on the carpet . As the lantern rays struck his eyes , the Kid recoiled and closed the door . His turn would come next , he knew . The flat-voiced hombre who evidently came here to meet him would return and The woman scrubbed away at the carpet industriously . She went out but left the lantern there on the floor . Opening the door once more , the Kid shielded his eyes from the lantern and took one stride toward it . The wind had freshened with the coming dawn and the house creaked and rattled .  | Then boots sounded on the front steps again . With the opening of the front door the lantern guttered . It saved the Kid from being seen as he retreated into the room again . The new arrival banged in and sang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What the heck what ? " said Sadie from the hall leading to the back . " What do you want ? " Through a crack in the door , the Kid saw the latest arrival make a sweeping bow , pulling off a battered **25;84;TOOLONG sombrero a busted swamper would have been ashamed to be found dead in . He was a sawed-off man but built like a bearcat , as wide as he was high . He had rundown boots , ragged Levis , a disreputable greasy vest . He grinned impishly over a faded rag of neckerchief with a round moon of roguish face and merry eyes . " Ma'am , I was sure I saw a light as I came up the trail . And I thought , perhaps in such a beautiful domicile there will be no doubt a friendly soul like yourself , ma'am , who would , in return for some small recompense , come to the aid of a poor ail-ing ? " " What do you want ? " Sadie demanded sharply . Frisco Morgan cleared his throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for it . I ? "  | At first the watching Kid thought she was going to deny him . Then her eyes sank deeper on either side of her sharp nose . She gestured toward a chair , gave him a chilly smile , and vanished into the rear . The Kid felt like a trapped rat . He was speculating about his next move , knowing that it had to be made quickly . Daylight came closer with every second . A dry branch snapped underfoot just outside his window . When he edged the blanket back , he saw the woman slipping by down to the trail . The slayer of the sheriff and some others came out of the woods . There were six-seven of the latter , more than the Kid expected . The woman started to gesture as she talked , pointing at the front of the place . Down in a corner of the window , a piece of rag had been used to plug up a break in the pane . He worked it out and bent to put his ear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It lulled a few moments . The flat monotonous voice of the man carried to him . " Frisco Morgan of the Lamotte bunch . . ? You 're sure ? " The woman nodded vehemently . The man turned to his followers in the gray light of the fast thinning night . " All right . We 'll pull the wounded man trick on him , and put a window in his head before  | he knows what 's hit him ! Come on , Taber . " They moved out of sight in and out where the road slanted down to the creek . It was only a matter of seconds before the Kid reached his decision . The jasper in the parlor might be an outlaw , but the flat-voiced man was no better ; he had murdered Levi Raye , a John Law . And the Kid 's sense of fair play would n't let him stand calmly aside while they ganged up on the newcomer . Swinging back across the room , one of his boots struck the iron leg of the bed ringingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of his face to ward off the light that rendered him helpless . In the middle of the room , Frisco Morgan stood covering him with a cocked gun . " What 's the trick , hey , you little saddle tramp ? " The Kid blinked in pain . The glare of the lantern was like a blow , beating through his eyeballs at his brain . " Get that dang light out , mister ! They 're coming in to cut you down . " " Sure . Watch out for that fella behind me , hey ? I know that one . " He waved scornfully with his free hand , a piece of rag tied around it . " Who are they outside , huh ? " " How do I know ? " the Kid cried impatiently , shrugging inside his slicker . " You want a formal  | introduction to the gun-slicks aiming to hand you a grazing permit in Hell ? " Frisco cocked an eyebrow dubiously . " Never mind giving me your handle , fellow . I do n't like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From outside came a loud prolonged groan , then stumbling steps . Eyes closed now , the Kid swung to where the lantern stood . He felt for the hot chimney , then blew down it hard . It went out . " Me , now I am behind a chair , " Frisco called low . " You make the move for a gun an ' ? " " Chunkhead ! Could n't I have drilled you through the door easy minutes ago ? " the Kid whispered back hoarsely . " Well , now , fellow , maybe ? " Frisco shifted into the Kid 's view in the gloom . A voice from the grayness outside cursed in pain , then cried , " Anybody inside ? Help me , fer the love o ' Gawd ! " Frisco turned . " Hey , somebody 's in trouble ! We ? " The Kid cried out a warning , but too late . Frisco pulled open the front door , paused a moment . When no gunshots greeted him , he flashed a look back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the foot of the steps . Guns snapped on the half born day . Powder flashes lanced from one end of the gallery , from  | behind the railing . The apparently injured man at the trail edge rolled from sight down in the cut and opened fire over the bank . Splinters flew from the door frame as the crouched Kid darted forward . Half spinning , Frisco was knocked flat on the gallery . One of his guns jounced from his grip and went clattering down the steps . A man took shape out of the dimness , rushing for the steps . As the Kid got to the door he saw a slug vent Frisco 's battered hat crown . The Kid 's two guns bucked in his hands as he slammed the triggers . As he brought up short , there was a yelp of pain from the rushing man and he beat a frantic retreat . A slug fanned the Kid 's cheek and he whirled to face the fire from over the porch rail . A dim figure fired away through the railing spindles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spindles splintered and the drygulcher was gone . Somebody in the tall grass across the trail had chunks of the gallery floor jetting about his feet . The Kid ignored them to grab Frisco as the latter pushed up to his knees . On his left shoulder a red splotch slowly widened to show at the armhole of his vest . The Kid hooked an arm around his thick torso and hauled him back through the door . " Hey , I 'm a big damfool ! " Frisco snorted as he whisked a gun from inside his shirt with his right  | hand , a small .3 2 . " You ? " But the Kid had jumped away from him , warned by the instinct of the out-trails . They were rushing the front of the place ; he turned the other way in the dim room and peered down the hall that ran to the back of the long house . A door back there creaked faintly on its hinges through the spasmodic racket of gunfire , and a doubled shape appeared in the opening . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an empty shell . Before he could bring his second piece of hardware into play , the door had shut with a slam . Stumbling steps went across the kitchen and the outside door banged . Frisco Morgan 's lighter weapon banged twice , shattering the window on the left side of the room . " Ha , you sonuva dog , you ai n't going to bother nobody no more for a whale of a long time ! " He headed for the side of the front door frame . A bullet zinged in through the broken window and left a neat hole in the flap of the stocky man 's vest . The crash of the Kid 's right gun swallowed the other report . The hairpin outside the window went diving into the brush . Frisco 's gun snapped out the front . Then it grew still so they could hear the swishing of the tree tops in the wind . Busy reloading , the Kid saw  | Frisco looking down at his .32 and talking to himself . " What 's the matter , pard ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruckus back outside of Misery Flats night before last . Seems I 've used up all the .32 shells I had ! " He sagged against a chair , holding his hit shoulder . Frisco wore a big grin but he was hurt more than he was letting on ; he was that breed of man . His head wobbled . It was very still . The Kid moved toward him , extending one of his own weapons . He understood what the bunch outside was doing , silently cursed the fact that they were holed up in such a large place . Those outside realized now that Frisco was ready for them , and not alone . They were deploying , spreading about the place for a sneak-up and a final rush . And the Kid knew the place was too big for him and the wounded Frisco to cover against every angle . It was just a matter of time . Frisco savvied too . " Them dang sons 'll be batting in on every side soon . " He had pushed back his sombrero to reveal a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil look in stark contrast to his round face when his hat was on . There was a knife gash scar running from over his left car across his hairless skull .  | The scar seemed to fade out before the wheeling Kid 's eyes . He paused in his pivot , sleepy eyes straining . Frisco 's head grew vague as if he were backing into dimness . The Kid could n't tell next whether he was bald or not . Frisco 's grin seemed to fade and his features blur together . Solo Strant caught his breath hard as he twisted to stare out the door . In the east , the cloud layer thinned and a clear scintillating shaft of sunlight pierced through . It spread and thickened as a golden glow flooded across the land . Daylight had come . The stir in the grass across the trail was blotted from the Kid 's vision as if blackness had fallen . He was blind again , helpless .  | " You all right , hey ? " Frisco asked . " Yeah , sure . Frisco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em busy out here ? " He himself was licked , but there was no sense in this Frisco getting his chips cashed too . Alone Frisco would n't have a prayer of holding the house . Frisco whistled softly . The Kid heard his boots creak as he moved . " Hey , fella , you kept my hide from being nailed to the fence twice already .. . and I like it here . Nice comfortable place . " The Kid tried to still the quivering inside him . It was n't a nice feeling to know that he was going to be cut down like some helpless crippled animal . " You spot any of ' em closing in yet ? And keep a watch on the hall to the back , too . " He kept his voice casual . " I think somebody got in upstairs , " Frisco said after some moments . He was talking through his locked teeth . The loss of blood from the wound in his shoulder flesh was catching up with him . " Maybe ? "  | But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen ears caught the reverberations of faint hoofbeats . A bullet horneted through the broken window and gouged the ceiling . As the gun report died the Kid caught the hoof drumming more clearly . He became aware of a drop of cold sweat tickling his chin . Somebody was nearing , some party . But there was no telling who they might be . Frisco Morgan brushed by the Kid to peer through the door opening . " Some riders on the other bank of the creek . . . . Hey , this bunch here is pulling out . They 're running their hosses outa the woods . " A moment later the sightless Kid heard a man bawling orders and the clop-clop of horses racing up the trail away from the creek . Then there was the splash of riders coming through the water . Frisco let out a yell and grabbed at the Kid 's sleeve as he rushed out onto the porch . The Kid stumbled over the door sill and banged into the jamb . " Hey , Jus ! " Frisco sang out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crucial point of a  --  aw , shucks , boss , you got here in the nick of time ! My hide 'd be nailed to a fence now if it had n't been for my friend here , Mr. ? " " Smith , " put in the Kid evenly , not knowing yet  | what he was up against . To be Solo Strant in these parts seemed to be an invitation to a hang-rope . He could dimly make out the blurred figures of a dozen or so riders beyond the gallery . A tag end of the dissolving storm clouds blotted out the sun 's face briefly . In the softer light the Kid saw one of the horsemen sliding a black cloth mask over his face . " Let 's make tracks , Frisco , " the one said in a small , quick voice . The Kid knew that one must be the leader , the infamous Jus Lamotte . The savage killer . " Come on , Smith . You 're in good company now . Come ? " Frisco frowned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huh ? " " Feel like somebody poleaxed a steer critter ? with my head , " the Kid said to cover up . He put out his arm and Frisco took it and led him down the steps . " Meet the boss , " Frisco said . Lamotte and Frisco spoke briefly , the former wanting to know who the attackers were . Frisco could n't answer that one . The Kid said nothing . Then he and Frisco went off to get the Kid 's pony behind the alders . The blinded Kid stumbled and his sombreo flopped off . Frisco retrieved it , tut-tutting . " Got your nice new gray Stetson smack in the mud , Smith . Hey , what 's your first name ? "  | " Call me Smitty .... My what ? " " Your new gray skypiece , " Frisco said , drawing him on . " Gray . . . . " Then the Kid knew . It had been somebody else 's hat he had taken from the wall hook just before the trouble started . When Frisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the stirrup and swung up with relief . But cutting over toward the road , a low branch cut him across the face . " You ca n't see so good , hey , Smitty ? " " Not right now . . . . I 'll be all right . " " Jumping Jehoshaphat ! Well , do n't you sweat . I 'm stickin ' close to you till you 're all right . Hey , you know , Smitty , I like your face ! " They rejoined the others . The Kid would have liked to have questioned that woman , Sadie , but with night gone he was no longer calling the play . The leader called something and they swung up the rise but turned northward through the woods after a short distance . It was growing hot fast . The breeze was sagescented and one of the nearby riders said it was going to be a scorcher . At moments , the Kid had the illusion of being a prisoner , because he could n't see where they were headed . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlaw 's hideout . He did n't know  | whether he was better or worse off than before , but he decided to keep his blindness as much a secret as possible . From the motion of the animal under . him , he realized they had entered broken hilly country . Once he knew they were in a narrow steepsided canyon by the way the hoofbeats echoed off the stone walls . Two-three hours had passed , he figured , when they drew up in the shade of a hollow . " The settlement 's just down the track , " Frisco said . " We split up here . " A settlement seemed a strange place for a lobo headquarters . " All right , you 're with the boss and me now , " he added a little later . They rode along a trail , narrow because the Kid could feel the brush slapping his legs in the stirrups . He next heard the creak of a wagon and boot heels smacking on a wooden sidewalk . " Reckon we could do with a bite of grub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the dimness of a big wooden awning the Kid could see faintly . He saw they were headed into a mangy-looking restaurant with flyspecked windows and a broken-in screen door . Frisco led him along to a little table in an ell as a beaming wizened up little Mex trotted in from the kitchen behind . Nobody gave an order ; they just sat there and the  | Mex proprietor seemed to understand . The Kid could n't figure it . He made himself a quirly by touch , expertly , and drew deep on the fragrant smoke . Frisco had lighted up but Lamotte did n't smoke , refusing with thanks when the Kid extended his sack of makin 's vaguely . " Just see two gophers go into their holes , " the Mex said , trotting in again and beaming some more . They rose and the leader pulled open a door leading into the cellar . Frisco assisted the Kid down a narrow flight of stairs . They came into a dirt cellar with some crates stacked along the walls . The match in Frisco 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloom . Frisco hauled aside a crate to reveal a low door in the earth wall . They passed through it , down a couple of steps and into a larger earth-walled chamber . Two men were already there , lounging at a long wood table made of planks across trestles , a candle in a bottle in the middle . Shielding his eyes from the wan unsteady light the Kid dropped into a chair , slicker drawn close about him . A sudden thought made him uneasy . These outlaws had taken him into their hideout ; getting out might be quite another matter ; he knew too much about them now . Frisco clumped down and took the bottle with the candle and moved it to a ledge in the wall behind the Kid .  | " Smitty got hit in the head with something and ca n't see so good , " Frisco explained . He had seen the way the Kid recoiled from lamplight . Solo looked ahead in the dimness and saw the leader across from him , his mask gone now . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dark gleaming red hair . Lamotte 's face was smudged with trail dust and yet somehow handsome in a striking way , accentuated by the large light blue eyes . Those eyes ran over the Kid carefully , returning to his gray sky-piece with a slightly puzzled look . In a gloved hand , Lamotte toyed with a well honed bowie knife . " Say your handle was Smith ? " Lamotte finally asked . The Kid shrugged , catching the sarcasm in the other 's voice . " As good a name as any . Tomorrow it might be something right different . " " That way , eh ? " Lamotte 's lips curved in a smile . The Kid nodded . Lamotte asked him what he was doing in the Pothole country . " Riding , " the Kid said . He decided to probe a little indirectly . " Going to look up a friend , George Grew . He 's got a cow outfit over by Garson . He ? " " Did have , " said one of the men at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . " George kicked the bucket couple of days ago over  | in Garson City . Heart failure , the sawbones said . " The Kid 's hopes hit bottom . He mumbled something about it being too bad . His hazy plans were exploded , shot to the wind . Unconsciously his hand started to his throat where the silver skull usually hung . " It adds up to this , " he told himself as his alert brain explored every angle . " I was expected here in the Pothole . The ring  --  or whatever it is  --  that George Grew wrote about , they were waiting for me . And they 've already got me branded in this country as having gone lobo bad .... " The Mex proprietor brought down a bottle of redeye . Frisco passed the Kid a cup with a liberal potation . Lamotte refused any . The Kid 's thoughts continued . " A jasper sashaying around the country passing himself off as me . If I can cut his sign , maybe-so I can get to the man or ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hombre myself  --  and helpless save in the dark . " In the vague gloom he saw that Lamotte was studying him intently despite an air of lounging nonchalance . " It is never pleasant to learn a friend has died , " Lamotte said lazily , rubbing at a besmudged cheek . The Kid decided to probe a little further . " I 'd like to run across this Silver Kid fella too . " Frisco exploded half an oath , shut off the rest ,  | then began to say something . A flick of Lamotte 's eyes and Frisco was silent . Lamotte eyed the Kid again , the former 's gaze concentrating on his gray flannel shirt and hat . " You might n't have so far to go , Smith . " " No ? You know where this Kid hangs his hat now ? " Lamotte traced with a finger in a spot of moistness on the table top . " Maybe . Maybe not . He seemed to be on the move . Gully 's store at Misery . Then the shooting over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was like a poker game , each of them seeking to find out what the other held and knew in the way of information . The Kid asked if Lamotte knew this Silver Kid of whom they spoke . Lamotte drew out a tailor-made cigarette , flipped it around , and finally said something meaningly about never having met him face to face . The Kid became aware of a strange reaction toward this outlaw boss ; he could n't understand it . He had no reason either to admire or like Jus Lamotte . Yet he felt inexorably drawn toward the very slim , graceful-moving bandit . There was something mysterious about it . " You 've got a score to settle with this Kid , Smith ? " The Kid 's sphinxlike face showed nothing , merely  | growing more sleepy-eyed as anger boiled in him . He felt as if he struggled against the unknown forces in the Pothole with his hands manacled behind him . They might as well have been with that trouble with his vision . " Suppose we put it this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might 've known him once . " " You knew the Kid ? " one of the men broke in eagerly . Lamotte silenced him with a small curt gesture . Solo Strant continued , " And  --  well , that I might have a message for the man who is hiring him now . " Lamotte threw away the unlit cigarette . " I might have a message for his boss , too  --  but it could be delivered through this black-hearted rat of a Kid himself if our trails ever crossed ! " Lamotte 's small mouth parted over very white even teeth in a grimace of controlled fury . A gloved hand fisted . Frisco spoke up hurriedly . " You 're about the same identical size as this Kid , Smitty . I saw the Kid once . You got black hair , too . But I can see the difference . You ai n't him ! " He laughed loudly , then grabbed at the charred cigarette stub that unhooked from his lower lip . The piece of rag around his hand fell back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second heavy-planked door in the dirt cellar . Lamotte  | glided from the chair with the effortless undulation of a sleek cat and had a gun out . Other muzzles appeared in the dimness . One of them went over to unbar the second door ; it gave onto a tunnel that led from the outside . The others were all watching the newcomer . Only the Kid saw the part of Frisco Morgan 's hand bared by the slipped bandage . It bore an angry red bullet track across the back of it . The Kid knew at once . Back in the fracas at Solomon 's Oasis . . . Frisco was the one who had edged his gun in the door for a blast at him ; the one whom he had marked with his fatal brand . Lamotte finished talking to the new arrival and came over to the Kid . " A doctor will be here to see you shortly . You need n't worry  --  it 's a man we can trust . " The Kid drew himself up , swaggering unconsciously . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like a cat on a hot grid . He did n't feel safe with this Frisco around . " Except that you ca n't see  --  save in the dark , " Lamotte said .  | The sawbones came . The Kid was in bed in a room over the restaurant . The doctor cleaned out the wound and found a piece of stone deeply imbedded in it close to the skull bone . Dimly the Kid could recall climbing back onto his pony after a fall during the nightmare of a chase from the Oasis . After he removed the foreign matter and applied a patch of bandaging over the cut , the medico gave the Kid a sleeping potion and spoke in vague terms about pressure on a nerve center that affected the vision . " A good sleep and he 'll be like new . No fever . And his eyes 'll be the same as ever , " he promised in departing , wheezing a whisky breath . The Kid felt himself dozing off almost immediately and tried to fight it off . As his senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . They simply did n't add up to make sense . The strange Jus Lamotte , an outlaw himself , yet deeply vindictive about the Kid who had gone outlaw , and Frisco Morgan who bore his bullet brand . If Frisco  | ever learned who he was . . . He twisted his head toward the sawed-off Frisco lounging in the doorway . " Say , mister , I lent you a gun just before your friends came along back at that house on the trail , " the Kid said . Frisco pushed back his hat and scratched his bald head . " Did you , now ? Hmmm . Reckon you 're right . I musta lost the dang shooting iron , I guess , " he said . " Do n't seem to remember it at all . What did it look like ? Anything special in the way of a butt ? " The Kid relaxed . " Forget it . I 'll pick up another . " Lamotte 's quick , soft voice faded into the distance . When he woke , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see . For a moment he forgot that anything had happened to him . Then memory returned and the sweat started on him . He flung off the blanket and sat up , swinging his feet to the floor . With shaking hands he drew on his boots . In a moment he would learn about his eyes . Then he caught the flat spattering sound of gunfire from the road and knew what had wakened him . Pulling his lone gun from under the pillow , he checked and saw the chambers still held shells as when he had put it away . Another couple of shots from the road and a man yelling in fury . Wood  | snapping and splintering as bullets churned into it . The Kid hustled from the room , into the dark hall . He peered down the stairs and saw that the restaurant was also dark . Then he felt the other presence and swivelled , snapping his hogleg around . Jus Lamotte stood over by the door whence the Kid had just emerged . With his catlike vision in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colt swinging carelessly by the trigger guard . Lamotte said hello . Strant asked what was going on outside . " John Castro 's Anchor-T gang of gunslingers , " Lamotte said without excitement . " Somebody must have trailed us in and then gone back for the others . They 're shooting the daylights out of the place , are n't they ? " The Kid sensed his reply would be fraught with significance . The small hairs at the back of his neck climbed . He and Lamotte were still playing a game . " Castro , " he repeated the name questioningly . " He 's the top man of the Pothole , Smith . Never met him ? " " No . Maybe I should . " He frowned perplexedly . Lamotte ran a small tongue over parted lips like a gambler awaiting the turn of a card . Watching , the Kid sensed that warm strange reaction in himself that Lamotte seemed to rouse . The latter said : " Seems like Castro was looking for you , though .  | When his bunch first struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Of course , you are n't a prisoner . " There was another crackle of gunfire . Strant said nothing . Lamotte teetered on slim legs in riding breeches and glossy black boots . " If you want to join Castro  --  well , you 've got the jump on me , Smith . " Lamotte nodded toward the levelled hogleg the Kid held . The Kid grinned , lowering the muzzle . " How about cutting down on that outfit ? They 're trying to burn down your bunch and ? " Lamotte laughed with a surprising softness . " All right , Smith . Better reload your gun . Those are blanks in it . " The Kid flushed , feeling like a greenhorn who has been bucking a marked-card game , reloaded . Lamotte led him down the hall to a window and indicated a ramshackle barroom down on the corner across the road . From several angles around it muzzle flashes pocked the night at intervals . Lamotte said two of the bunch were holed up in the bar . " What 're we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cut through to ' em and ? " But Lamotte said no . There were too many Anchor-T gunhands around . More than thirty , they figured , up at the other end of the drawn out  | hill settlement now , searching homes for the man they had come after . The Kid . The Kid wondered why he was the target for the Castro bunch but pushed the thought aside as he argued they could still rescue the pair in the bar . Again Lamotte vetoed it . " Only a few of my men are here . The rest have scattered back into the hills as we always do when we come in . We never make a stand-up fight if we can help it . Two others were in the bar but slipped out a few minutes ago as the two there now covered their escape . " The Kid , growing impatient rapidly , tried to protest again . Lamotte touched his hand . For once Lamotte 's hand was ungloved . The bandit boss withdrew it almost immediately and proceeded to draw on buckskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's waist was smaller than the Kid 's . " Do n't worry . They came in to wipe us out , and it 's like chasing a whistle in a fog . ' What do they find ? Practically nothing . No resistance . Nothing to fight . They might capture a man or two . And then ? Well , it 's a long treacherous trail out of the Superstition Hills  --  one that my band knows well . This country is their back yard . . . . No raiding posse has ever gotten a prisoner back to jail from here yet . . . Come along . "  | Lamotte turned and led the way downstairs into the restaurant . The Kid began to understand things , especially the talk he had overheard in bars en route into the Pothole  --  talk about how hunting down the Lamotte outfit was like chasing the will-o-the-wisp . " They 'll be working down this way to search soon , " Lamotte said , opening the door into the cellar . " So you 'd better be gone then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a lantern lifted . The Kid flinched from the bright rays and threw up an arm to shade his face . A shadow like a pall crossed his features and his lips were lean and blanched with strain . The old fool of a sawbones had been wrong . He was still blinded by light . There was n't time for him to mourn the disappointing blow . They went into the second secret cellar and then through the door and along the tunel . It was low , forcing even the half-pint Kid to tuck his head down . It bent around a layer of rock once , sloped upward after another couple of hundred feet . Ahead , Frisco called back that he was at the steps and pushed up a trap door to let wan starlight flow through . They emerged in the heart of a thicket in a small hollow . From off to the left a gun crackled once sharply . Waiting there with several ponies was Monk , the big stern-faced one with several front teeth missing .  | He reached down to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook off his arm with a scowl . Frisco came back through the brush to say somebody was approaching . They waited . A running figure burst from the tall grass on a slope to the south . He had a leg wound and hobbled , hatless head bobbing . A few moments later , a handful of men broke into sight behind him . " Anchor-T rats ! " Frisco cried as a couple of them fired at the fugitive . " It 's my cousin , Al ! " said Monk pointing at the hunted man who was headed straight at them . " He 's coming this way and ? " He did n't say any more . " We could hit ' em with a surprise blast of lead and ? " Frisco began , thrusting his shapeless sombrero clear of his hairless head . " And bring the whole pack down here to discover the tunnel ? " Lamotte said with sarcastic scorn . " Al knows our rules . Nobody must lead a posse to the hideout no matter how badly . . . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice broke with a tremor under the stars , then was cold and passionless again . The fleeing Al kept coming , vanishing behind a hummock once only to dart around the side of it and straighten to head straight for the tiny brushfloored indentation . He seemed to bear a charmed  | life . Behind , gun mouths flashed red-yellow tongues at him , but he remained unhit , hurtling faster as he neared the hollow . The Kid saw the flash of starlight on steel as Lamotte 's gun jumped from the tieddown holster . The Kid shot his eyes to the bandit chief 's face ; the black silken mask had been whipped over it . " Stop , Al ! Swing away or ? " Monk grunted tensely . Al kept coming . Lamotte 's gun spoke in the din of the pursuers ' reports . Al stopped dead and recoiled as if he had collided with a stone wall ; crimson suddenly stained his checkered shirt front . He spun half around slowly and then hit the ground like a collapsing sack abruptly emptied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt him . The Anchor-T men ran up and gathered around him . Two of them argued loudly about whose bullet had finally dropped him . Then they moved back up the slope toward the line of houses along the road . " All right , " Lamotte finally said , after listening to the gunfire from the barroom . " Better get going , Smith . I 'm letting you ride out . " The Kid smiled scornfully . From the words he gathered that few , if any , ever were taken into the hideout of the Lamotte band and allowed to leave  | the hills . He suddenly hated the quiet haughty , cold-blooded Lamotte . He could n't easily swallow the gunning of Al , one of the bunch . And Strant had a pride of his own ; he was n't accustomed to asking any man 's permission for his own coming and going . " Perhaps we 'll meet again sometime , " he said drily . " Quien sabe ? " Lamotte muttered in Spanish . " Where 're you heading ? Frisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills to your destination . " " Garson City , I figure , " the Kid said . He had already decided that . He had no plans now . But Garson was the headquarters of the Pothole country . Maybe there he would cut the sign of the bogus Silver Kid . He glanced down to see Lamotte 's gloved outstretched hand , away from the tied-down gun holster . In his hatred for Lamotte he noticed that , his eyes fastening on the holster in the dim night . Then , from behind , Frisco Morgan nudged him with an elbow , an elbow that jutted because his hand was just casually draped over his own gun butt . " Let 's pull our pin , Smitty . " His voice had a veiled sharpness . Without shaking hands , the Kid nodded and slung a foot into the stirrup of his nearby paint horse . Frisco climbed into the hull of another and they rode northward out of the hollow through a  | little cut . The Kid glanced back to see Lamotte with a hand lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kid spat in cold anger . Swinging into a gallop , they moved around a mist-wreathed , flat-topped mound , turned sharply east to take the passage between two humps on another hill . Frisco led the way , swinging and cutting without hesitation as if he followed a clear-marked road . Repeatedly the pony hoofs rang on old lava outcroppings . The low-lying mist seemed to belly and suck around them like a living thing crouched in the stunted trees . There was usually some kind of a fog about the upper Superstition Hills . It was part of their mystery . From the toes up the Kid 's lithe body quivered with impotent cold fury , and the desolation of the bleak country seemed to have crept into his very heart . It was a crushing blow to find his normal vision had not returned . Everything seemed to have gone amiss . George Grew was dead . Somebody was out to have him measured for a hempen necktie . And he himself was like a living dead man , helpless , as unarmed as a paralytic , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bitter pill to put down and it kept boiling up from his insides like vicious bile . And finally , Jus Lamotte , the killer . " Here ! " Frisco had dropped back and swung  | closer . He was passing over a gun , one with a silver butt . It was the one the kid had lent him and that he claimed to have lost . The Kid 's eyes grew sleepier , closing to pinched slits , as he accepted it . Frisco feigned a yawn without avoiding his stare . " And  --  here ! Them fancy silver-stocked hoglegs of yours are liable to sorta  --  well , mark you . . . . " He extended a plain walnut-stocked Colts and met the Kid 's eyes squarely over it . " Take it  --  Smitty . " They entered a murky gulch , the Kid realized . He and Frisco kept turning toward each other , as they swayed to the motion of the ponies , as if waiting for the other to speak . Frisco Morgan knew who he really was ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he caught his own fingers reaching for the silver skull usually strung at his throat . His eyes twisted to Frisco . He broke into a tuneless whistle . Frisco stared hard past his pony 's ears too obviously ....  | John Castro felt like something that had been dragged through a barbed-wire-lined knothole . Fresh-shaven , rigged out in his impeccable gray , he was the picture of a man with the world at his fingertips . But his hands twitched and bluish rings circled his eyes . He had been hitting the bottle hard since the night Barrat had come in with the news the Silver Kid was a prisoner over in Misery ; things had been going steadily wrong since then . With Eberly driving on the seat before them , Castro and his wife were riding into Garson , moving down the curving street of the Old Town upstream from the main town . Set on a shelf of land overhanging the Massacre River , the Old Town , now a bloated cluster of sordid hovels and whisky mills , had been the original settlement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood stage came the river used to inundate the flats where the main town now stood . Then the levee , the staunch dark embankment constructed of clods cut from the marshes downstream , had been thrown  | up . Now , with brake shoes screeching on the rims as they went downgrade , the levee was revealed as the western boundary of the town , curving and beetle-browed . John Castro looked down at Garson himself , sprawling to the eastern ridge , dotted with new buildings of green lumber being pushed up . A haze of dust smoke clung like a canopy over it from the traffic in the streets . Castro felt it was his town . It was lusty and unbridled , crude and raw . As county seat , it had a sheriff . But the Law to Garson City was merely a force to protect it against outside marauders . Its unwritten code was that of Colonel Colt , a jury of six sitting in a man 's cartridge chambers , and speed from the hip making might . Soon he would hold it completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man on the wooden sidewalk tipped his hat deferentially and Castro answered with a half-salute . Sometimes he thought of himself as the Napoleon of the cow country . Bonaparte 's life was the only book he had ever read . Shots slammed from inside a whisky mill , then a bloody-headed man tumbled through the half-leaf doors , a brawny bartender appearing behind him with a bung-starter ready for another wallop . Diane lifted a bit of dainty lace handkerchief to  | her nose . " A nice town you run here , Mr. Castro ... . And incidentally , you smell like a barroom fly caught in a whisky keg . " His eyes flickered . " And you , my sweet , smell like a two-bit barroom hussy with that French perfume doused on you . When I pulled you out of the mud-hole , I had a right to expect some change . " He skinned his eyes at her but she was already bowing to a woman in heavy black . He looked and saw that it was Mrs. Raye , widow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was genuinely sorry he 'd had to drill Raye . He 'd gone to Sadie 's place that night for a meeting with Toe Gotch , one of his specially hired gun-slicks posing as the Kid . He 'd failed to get to talk with Gotch , and that Kid , escaping hanging at Misery was on the loose somewhere in the Pothole . It was n't a pleasant thought . Of course , Raye 's death he had blamed on the Jus Lamotte bunch . They turned onto Garson City 's thronged main street , past the Cattlemen 's Bank . Castro lowered an eyelid . He was the Cattlemen 's Bank , just as some day there would n't be much in the town and country he did n't own . So much that even Diane beside him would n't be able to curl her lip in a sneer . Eberly guided the buckboard in before the Garson  | House with its two white galleries . Taber rode up beside it on his horse , then twisted as men came boiling out of an alley across the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad track gang were beating at a huge cow-faced man rising from the ground . The latter swung out an arm like a club . One laborer was swept against a wall to drop limply . The six-and-a-half-foot giant spat blood , seized another two and brought their heads together with a sound like melons splitting . There was a cry of warning . The giant wheeled to see two men rushing at him , one with a bared blade , the other tugging at holster . A gun jumped into the giant 's hand , poking out like a finger and as naturally . The fight was over . One of the throng backed against the wheel of Castro 's buckboard snorted . " That new gun-slick Barrat hired himself , that Bustard there , he 's one tough pilgrim ! What 's he need to carry hardware for , huh ? " Castro 's mouth tightened . He looked up onto the hotel veranda and into the jovial beaming face of huge-girthed Tuck Barrat . " Evening , Mr. and Mrs. Castro . Welcome to town ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel dining room . Afterward , Diane went up to their suite to look over the new gowns  | that had just arrived on the stage . Castro and Barrat chatted over cigars and drinks . Barrat mentioned Nels Antrade . " He 's snorting around town , John . I think he 's ambitious to wear the sheriff 's badge . " Barrat watched his man closely , knowing why he was planting the seed . He had certain plans and he wanted himself covered if anything went amiss . " Please tell Mrs. Castro I 'll be back later . Got business , " Castro said , rising . ' When he went off the hotel gallery , three lounging men eased out of chairs and trailed behind Eberly and Billy Taber who walked close to the boss . John Castro always had gun toughs at hand to protect him . He made the rounds , and read the signs . His prestige was slipping . He had failed to nab the Silver Kid ; his hand-picked sheriff , Raye , had been killed and he was apparently unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside him . Sometimes he thought of himself as a man who had everything and yet nothing . Not even his wife . He gave a sign to Taber . Eberly and the others dropped off . Castro swung onto the broad track that paralleled the main road , leaving the glow of the coal-oil torches behind . Another turn and he was striding upgrade toward the Old Town . He looked back . " That Bustard of Tuck Barrat 's is trailing us , "  | he told Billy Taber . " Oversized chunkhead ought to have another a ' instead of that in his name . Take care of him , Billy . " Castro went on . In the brooding gloom of the Old Town , he turned off onto a side track . Outside a ramshackle barroom dance-hall , he paused till Taber rejoined him . " Had to stand on tiptoe to wrap my gun barrel around that Bustard 's skull . " Taber chuckled . They went into the blue-smoke fog of the front room . The proprietor came hurrying up , his swagger changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stairs to the private rooms that gave off the balcony overhanging the dance-hall . A few minutes later , a couple of girls entered the private room where he 'd gone ... . It was late in the far reaches of the night , the music over and the crowd gone . The splintering of wood followed two quick gun reports in the place . Coat and necktie off , hair rumpled , Castro bolted out onto the gallery and into the worried proprietor . " ' S all right , " the latter assured Castro . " Gent 's feeling his oats . . . . Just a little harmless gunnin ' . " " Well , tell him to cut it out , " Castro ordered thickly . The owner rubbed his chin . " Mebbe you better speak to him yourself , Mr. Castro . He 's a tough gun-slick called Gotch. "  | Just once Castro 's jaw sagged ; then he had a grip on himself , suddenly swaying no longer . The fog faded from his eyes and he spoke with the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell Gotch John Castro wants to speak to him . " He waited until the proprietor had gone , then leaned over the rail and called for Taber in the bar . There was no response ; it was peculiar . Taber was one of those men who never seemed to sleep . " Billy ! Billy Taber ! " The sleepy drink-wrangler came to the entrance of the dance-hall and shook his head . " Nobody here . " " Nobody ? " Castro 's voice went hollow . Something akin to twinges of fear almost like rheumatic pains darted through his body . Nobody had noticed how , an hour or so back a towering cow-faced hombre had eased through the foggy smoke and snapped a tiny derringer into Taber 's side , saying : " Been looking for you , friend . Let 's git ourselves some fresh air . " And they had gone . Door hinges squeaked down the balcony and a half-pint of a wasp-waisted man eased out . Though hatless momentarily , he was garbed completely in black with silver trappings : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of silver buttons on his black shirt . A gun in one of the two holsters was  | silver stocked . It was Gotch , the killer Castro had hired to pass himself as the Silver Kid . Castro went over , coolly studying the small face that encompassed so much icy viciousness . " How did you get away from the Lamotte bunch , Gotch ? " Gotch shook his head and spat on the floor . " How ? Why , they never had me . The Lamotte bunch ? " Castro pointed to the door and they went into the room Gotch had been using . The gunman picked up the whiskey bottle from the table . " Put it down , " Castro said . He was n't obeyed . " Then if they did n't get you , why in blazes did n't you do something when we had that one of them trapped in Sadie 's place ? " Frowning in puzzlement , Gotch paused with the bottle near his lips . He shook his head . " Do n't bawl me out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on my tail that night I was supposed to meet you . I never got to Sadie 's place . " Castro 's face jerked as if he had been dealt a terrific blow . His eyes became glass in the crescents . " You never ? " Then he remembered how Sadie had described the man she had said awaited him in the bedroom . A man with silver-stocked guns and silver rowels in his spurs and a black sombrero . A  | man who answered the description of Gotch . Castro pawed and took the bottle from Gotch 's hand and took a long , choking slug . He knew then he had been within a few feet of the deadly Silver Kid himself . The real Kid !  | Gotch watched Castro . Gotch had thinking processes that extended no further than a trigger , the kind of a man who came to live by the gun very naturally . But he had the sense to know he was looking at a man breaking down . Then Smiling John Castro pulled the miracle again . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was transformed . He stared right through Gotch 's body , the twitching of his mouth stopping . Gotch abruptly felt small ; Castro slid into his coat . " What arc you doing here in that rig ? I told you to stay clear of this town and lay off the redeye , " Castro lashed him . Gotch tossed his head . " Well , I 'm finished . You ai n't giving me orders no more because I ai n't working for you no more . " " What ? " " That 's right . I came in to tell you I 'm done . " " You ca n't , dammit ! " " I have . Me , I ai n't no hollowheaded fool . The  | real Kid 's in these parts  --  and on the loose . ' S enough . I 'm pulling stakes . " Castro 's face was impassive . But fury like a thin flame licked behind the mould of his implacable features . " I gave you five hundred to play this game . And by Gawd ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I could talk , you know . " He stared coldly , then slapped on his hat and left . Castro poured himself a drink , thinking . He was a cool-headed opportunist , a canny gambler to the core . Now , he realized the tide was rolling against him . Antrade was ready to challenge his dominance . Barrat hiring himself that new bull of a gunslinger was evidence he was stacking his deck for the showdown . In general , men in the city were n't so in awe of Castro any more . Another little tilt now  --  and everything he had built up would go smash . And let this Gotch slope around , unbuttoning his lips and Castro rose and checked his guns . He seldom made his own shooting-play . Any trigger-fast fool with more braggadoccio than brains could be a lead-slinger , he had always figured . But Taber was n't around , and the tide was at the turn . He made a big bold play now or ... He left to go out and find Gotch . Castro packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City in the thinning blackness rode Solo Strant and Frisco Morgan . The moon had long since vanished . Frigid wan stars alone hung in the black vault above . " You had n't ought to come in here , Smitty , " Frisco said again . " ' Tai n't like you was yourself with  --  well , shucks , with your eyes right and everything . Garson 's hard-case . Some big gents are playing a rough game here , and the hairpin who happens to get in the way ... " Then his voice dropped off . He knew it was no use to argue . He had been talking this way for days . The Kid only rode in silence . It had been more than a week since they had left the bunch 's hideout back in the Superstition Hills . Now they were practically in Garson , and the bleak-faced Kid had no idea what his next move was to be . He felt like a blindfolded man trying to chase down shadows . Frisco , rubbing his mouth , snorted . Behind one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny light . It was a place that proclaimed itself a bar . Frisco dropped down and said he 'd be right out and slipped around to a side . He only had to rap once . The Kid sat his paint horse , thinking . Then he found his fingers at his throat where the silver skull usually hung . It was that extra-sensory reaction again , a  | peculiar involuntary gesture that betokened trouble was crowding close . The wind dropped and Strant heard something like the echo of a door closing , but the road seemed deserted . He sneered at himself . Not only was the skull gone from his rig and the black silver-buttoned shirt replaced with the gray flannel one he had taken from the hoeman 's place , but en route out of the Superstition Hills he had had Frisco purchase him a pair of gray trousers to supplant the black batwing chaps with the silver conchas that could mark him too . He had accidentally taken the wrong skypiece from Sadie 's place back at the creek . Now , outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only part of his old outfit left was the silver-stocked gun in his left holster , slung butt forward for the whipping cross-arm draw . In the twin scabbard on his other hip was the plain-butted gun Frisco had given him . His own second silver-handled hogleg was inside his waistband , under his shirt . Anybody who knew him only by hearsay , from a description of his rig , would never recognize him now . Then he threw a hand to his eyes , wondering if it were an hallucination . He did not look like his old self any longer . But a figure had detached itself from a side path and was crossing the road toward  | an alley , a figure who did look like his old self . The man was half-pint size , slim-bodied , garbed in black from spurs to hat . He had on batwing chaps with the conchas of the flaps jingling slightly . A black shirt with a double row of silver buttons . Silver-stocked guns jutted from his holsters , and when he paused to cup a match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver skull strung at his throat . This was the bogus Kid who was impersonating him , getting him branded as a killer and lobo ! Strant savvied in a split second . In the next , he had dropped to the ground silently , thanking the Almighty that it was still dark and he had his vision . He catfooted it down the road in the shadows . Gotch strode along quickly , glancing over his shoulder once to see if Castro had followed yet . He started to turn into the alley toward the river . A soft call came across the darkness , " Hey , you . Kid ! " Gotch knew , somehow , knew it as clearly as if he had heard a judge reading off his sentence in a courtroom with a noose visible beyond a window . This was it . Something told him the real Kid had overtaken him . Gotch half broke stride , then plunged on as if he had not heard . From the tail of his eye he saw  | the small figure gliding toward him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slashed up with gun-filled hands ; he did not use the real Kid 's own cross-arm draw . He figured he had the Kid beaten by a split second as he saw him running in . Strant 's arms crisscrossed over his body and gun barrels gleamed softly in the dark , then erupted in bloody splotches . But he had fired first with the unfamiliar weapon Frisco had given him , and he missed with both shots . Gotch 's hoglegs crashed away , exploding thunderously in the ten-foot wide alley . Then Gotch ran , yelling sharply once . Down the alley after him went the Kid , almost berserk now that he had caught up with the man who would have the answers , so locoed he failed to hear the slap of boots entering the alley behind him . Two men closed in speedily . They were a couple of old cronies of Gotch 's , gun-passers , whom he had run into . He had gotten them out of the private room at the dance hall before he stepped out to meet Castro . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to cover his rear when he emerged . The Kid fired again as the fleeting Gotch shifted from the shadow of an eave . Gotch cursed , telling that he had been nicked . Gotch dropped behind a  | rain barrel and cut loose . Two wicked-whistling pieces of lead blazed past the Kid 's hat from the rear . He pitched flat , but Gotch 's laugh was cut short . Wriggling around , Strant 's right gun slashed back up the alley . One of Gotch 's friends doubled and hit earth . Gotch busted into the open and ran around a bend . Crouched , the swift-moving Strant went after him , ignoring the other man in his rear . The alley narrowed and dipped into the shadow of the river dike . The hovels were tight-packed down there , wall to wall . Gotch ducked behind a huge squat rock before the Kid appeared , intending to let him pass and then take him from behind . Then a light went on behind the window of a shack opposite , and its ray fell across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled nerves . He turned and dashed wildly for the levee that imprisoned the river . If he could once get atop it , then over to the other side and onto one of the tongues of muddy flat , he could blast the daylights out of any man fool enough to come over the top of the bank after him . For a few moments as he scrambled up the side of the levee , he thought he had made it . Behind , bullets spat and roared as Gotch 's one remaining friend  | tried to get Strant . Gotch clambered onto the top and ran downstream along the bank . Like an apparition , Strant rose some ten yards down from him , having just scaled the levee himself . He knew what he was doing . He had to take this man alive so as to make him talk . Otherwise Toe Gotch would have been on his way to shake hands with the devil then and there . Gotch slammed triggers frantically , jerking at his hoglegs . As a result he was wild . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one rising so he could draw bead . Strant shot Gotch once through the shoulder , knocking him flat . Then he rushed in to cover him and disarm him . Gotch lay very still . Strant stooped to peer at him , hoping he was n't dead . Footsteps thudded on the mud top of the levee behind him . Strant whipped about in time to see Gotch 's friend lunging at him , striking with an empty gun . The man 's body slammed against the Kid as the latter 's left gun went off . Even as he died , the man 's descending gun barrel banged across the lurching Kid 's skull . The other fell sideward , half his face blasted away . He toppled into the river . Desperately turning about toward the downed Gotch as his senses  | swam , Strant saw that the latter had pushed himself to his knees , but he had lost his guns and was bleating feebly for mercy . A figure rose from the darkness of the alley below the levee . It was John Castro who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the river . The collapsing Kid waved at him , called out hoarsely , " Do n't kill him ! Do n't ? " " Hey , Smitty , where are ya ? " bawled Frisco Morgan as he barged down the alley . " Where ? " John Castro leveled his gun and shot three times very deliberately and accurately . Even as the Kid went to hands and knees , consciousness blurring fast , he saw Gotch , the bogus Kid , three holes in his chest , pitch over into the river . He was dead before he hit the water .  | When Solo Strant opened his eyes again , he pinched them shut almost immediately with bitterness . He could see that scene again over the river . Gotch , his impostor , helpless on his knees and begging for mercy . Alive . An hombre who could be made to talk . And then the shots coming from the alley below and the dead Gotch going into the river . Now it was a dead-end trail . He would be unable to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the purpose of passing himself off as the Silver Kid and acting the part of a killer outlaw . " By , grab , Smitty , are ya still alive ? " Frisco Morgan bent close to the prone Kid . His baby-like moon of face relaxed when the Kid opened his eyes once again . " That gent ? " the Kid said huskily , hoping grimly that he might be mistaken . Frisco nodded , rubbing sweat from his bald head . " Mr. Castro took care of him , Smitty ! Shot the daylights outa him . This John Castro , he 's sorta  | the big gun o ' Garson . But be careful of ? " He saw the sharp disappointment that stabbed across the Kid 's usually poker face . " That man  --  he meant something to ya , Smitty ? " " I  --  he was a gent I was looking for . " " Oh . . . . Here , have a snort of redeye . " Strant put it down , propping himself on an elbow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room off a bar . The desk in the corner told him it was the office of the place . Beyond the open door the swamper was mopping up the spur-scuffed floor . Strant could see his wooden stump on the left leg with the copper bands around it . Light glittered off the bands . " You sure got a mean lump on your head , Smitty . Ya ? " Strant was sitting up straight , feeling of his eyes hesitantly . His mind was a-swirl . What he saw  --  or thought he saw  --  seemed impossible . He watched the swamper dip his mop into a bucket , then stoop to pick up a half smoked cigar from beside the bottom of the bar . The swamper had swollen red hands . His gray hair fell in unkempt lank locks about his pinched face when he bent . Above him a freshly shined spittoon sat on the bar . Behind that he could see the bottles on the back shelf with their colorful labels .  | " Uh  --  fancy copper bands that swamper 's got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frisco failed to savvy . " Yeah . Why ? " The Kid said , " He sure shined up that spittoon slick as slobbers , did n't he ? " " Uh huh . What does it make us ? Like I was saying about this Castro ? " The Kid was ashen , hands fisted so the knuckles jutted . He rose suddenly . " Must be a big bright lamp they got out in that barroom , " he said . " Lamp ? Shucks , Smitty , it 's been broad daylight for a coupla hours . That Castro said he 'd be back soon and ? " Very quietly the Kid said it . " It 's daylight , Frisco , and I can see perfectly . I can see everything . I can see . . . " " Holy snakes , Smitty ! " He grabbed him in a bearish hug . Strant rubbed the back of his head gingerly . All he could figure was that the second blow had removed the pressure from the nerve that controlled his optic reactions to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little foolishly . Eyes eating up things , he walked to the door and out into the full sunlight . Up the grade from Garson itself rode John Castro . He waved at Strant ... . At a Chinese restaurant on the main street , John  | Castro and Strant ate breakfast together . Castro studied the Kid over his coffee cup and offered him a cigar . The Kid shook his head . " That was a right pretty piece of gunning last night , Smith , " Castro finally said . Strant nodded curtly , watching Castro through the sleepy-seeming , heavy-lidded eyes . He did n't dislike the man , not exactly . Yet he felt as if he knew nothing about what lay behind the impassive face . John Castro , he realized , was the kind of a man who wore an invisible mask . And the kind who never made a spontaneous move , who did nothing without a coldly calculated purpose . Still that could be described as plain level-headedness . " I 'd been looking for him , " Strant said in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you know who he was ? the gent who has been ? " Castro 's cup made a sharp sound as it hit the saucer . " I recognized him . Fella named Gotch , Toe Gotch . A very dangerous man . A killer to his toes . The country 's well rid of him . " " He was ? " the Kid began , tensing underneath . He now had no proof of who that dead man swept away by the river , had been . " Gotch , " Castro said in the toneless voice , " as I explained to the Citizens ' Committee first thing this morning . . . Oh , incidentally in telling them what  | a slick gunslinger you were , Smith , I sort of  --  well ? implied that I knew right well who you were . Vouched for you , you might say . " " I sabe . " His mind was probing for something as he listened to John Castro . Something he could n't quite put his finger on himself . Perhaps it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the voice of the man he 'd overheard speaking with Levi Raye , the sheriff . Then he mentally shook his head . He 'd heard the voice through a partition , blurred . Many men out here had that flat twang , the dry way of speaking in a monotone . It was impossible to say . Castro might have read his thoughts . " Our late sheriff , Raye , was slain by the Jus Lamotte outfit a short while back . The sheriff 's office is open . " He smiled with his crescents of eyes . " That 's what I was speaking to the committee about . About appointing a new man  --  and a capable one  --  to rod the law here for the rest of Raye 's term . Things are brewing too darned fast to wait for an election . " Strant saw it coming as he rose , and he wanted no part of it . They strolled out through the battered screen door , sending green bottle-flies buzzing . Castro moved with a new spring in his step . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can be the new sheriff , Smith . "  | They stood on the walk of the thronged busy street , smoking . Their eyes met . Castro said nothing , waiting . Strant tried to measure this man , to weigh his motives . " I do n't know . " Castro snapped ash from his stogie . " It would be a tough job  --  perhaps too tough for you or any other man . New times are coming to this country , a bigger day . And with it has to come a new understanding of the Law and the part it is to play . I wo n't say I 've been any angel myself , in my time . I guess I 've gone to Colonel Colt 's court a few times , but those days are gone . " Nodding , Strant jabbed his cigarette toward a patent medicine peddler haranguing a crowd from the tailboard of his gaudily painted wagon . " Looka him . A heap of wind and noise  --  and saying nothing . " Castro 's eyelids flickered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a tree . Taber sported a nice lump over one ear as a memento from Bustard last night . But when Castro looked at the Kid again , he had new respect . " All right , we 'll take the bark off it . I 'm a man with big holdings here in the Pothole ; so are those around me . This country is going to get bigger ? provided it 's run right , and big money can operate safe . Or else it 's going plumb hog-wild bad with  | two-bit gun toughs snapping triggers from behind every bush and hummock and road agents closing up all the trails . " " Yes ? " said the Kid . " So , frankly , men like me got a stake in seeing the country lined up and its horns pulled and its claws clipped . They 's a five thousand bonus for the hombre good enough to swing the job , and that job means getting rid of the Jus Lamotte bunch . " " The Lamotte outfit ... " " Yes ! They 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , Castro . I 'm not taking the job . " Castro sucked in his breath . He had set his heart on this thing . In that alley and on the levee he had seen enough to know the hombre standing at his elbow was a master of the gun and a fighting hellion in the bargain . Only such a man could have made the late Gotch plead for mercy . Anyway , John Castro had always been able to spot a king trigger man . This Smith would be his hold card to top Tuck Barrat 's Bustard , and he was the man to put on the hunt for Strant , the Kid himself . Castro knew he had to have him . " Hard , are n't you , Smith ? The bonus is  --  seven thousand  --  and five hundred . Take that , by Gawd ! " Strant heeled out his cigarette and then Barrat 's  | vast torso pushed from the throngs down the sidewalk . He rumbled a greeting , beaming , and ignoring the flicker of Castro 's eyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced Barrat to the Kid . " This is Smith , the man who shot Toe Gotch last night . " " That was the Silver Kid  --  or a man who has been passing himself off as the Kid , " Solo Strant said , lifting his eyes from the quirly he was building . " I do n't care what handle you might 've known him by . " Barrat guffawed . " Reckon you was mistaken , Smith . You say you killed that fella . But this Kid gent  --  he was alive and kicking right strong last night . " " What ? " said Castro . The Kid said the same with a lift of an eyebrow . " Gent just rode in with the word , " Barrat related . " A barroom on the west trail up from Leland was held up . The drink wrangler is still unconscious with a busted skull from a gun barrel blow , might not live . The holdup gent was masked , but everybody there recognized his rig under his coat . And one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps afterward . It was this  | Silver Kid all right . " He eyed Castro quizzically , thinking of what they both knew . Castro swore softly as if it were bad news . " By Gawd , we got ta stop this Kid . " Strant stood with a hand in his pocket fingering the silver skull there . " About that job , Castro . I 've been thinking it over . Your offer is a pile of money to spit at . . . . " When they crossed the road and turned in at the sheriff 's office down the line , Frisco Morgan waited no longer . He had been waiting on the steps of a barber shop for the Kid to finish his business . When he saw the latter head for the sheriff 's office with Castro , he read the signs . Solo Strant saw him go , hands jammed disgustedly in his pocket . Something inside the Kid twisted a little . Castro shoved open the door . " By the way , Smith , what 's your first name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior . On the wall was a reward handbill with the date line of " Hannibal , Mo . " Strant 's sleepy eyes returned to Castro . " Hannibal . . . Hannibal Smith , mister . " " Sheriff Hannibal Smith , you mean .... "  | Tuck Barrat mopped his sweat-glistening bald head with a silk bandanna as he waddled upstairs to the third floor of the hotel . At the top he halted . Smoke from a quirly curled before his eyes . The cigarette looked like a skinny splinter perched in the massive piece of flesh that was his face . He waited some moments to be certain nobody was interested in his whereabouts . Then he released his quirly down the well , heedless of who might be below , and went along the worn carpet of the corridor . Without seeming to change his stride he was abruptly moving as silently as a cat . He checked over his shoulder once and quickly stabbed a key into the door of the rear room and swung it open . It was still for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the open closet door behind which he had leaped , snorted and stepped into view . He holstered his guns and shoved a lock of his yellow hair off his forehead . He dropped down before the little table on which a half drunk  | bottle of whiskey stood beside a quirly smoking in a saucer . " Trying to scare me outa my pants  --  or catch yourself a piece of lead in the belly , Tuck ? " Antrade snorted , shuffling the deck of cards . The bed groaned under Tuck Barrat 's huge carcass . " Humph . Would n't want me to tell the whole cockeyed world you 're here , would you ? We ai n't supposed to be working close as this together , Antrade , you know . " " No  --  we ai n't , " Nels Antrade said , playing a spade queen on a diamond king in the solitaire layout . He spat it out in that hoarse whisper as if he disliked the idea anyway . " But we got sense and are big enough to forget any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Play that red ten on the club jack , Antrade . " Antrade 's neck went turkey-red as he saw his error . He swept the cards into a heap at one side and splashed himself a drink , pushing the bottle Barrat 's way . " We do n't aim to let Castro use us till he 's ready to whittle us down one by one , anyways . I ai n't a-going to be another Gordy . " It was the old instinct of the one-time outlaw speaking . " Castro 's bank did hold a tidy mortgage on Gordy 's place , " Barrat said measuredly . " Of course , they 'll have to take it over now . "  | Barrat 's cool casual tone was like a fuse to the highly emotional Antrade . He rapped the table so the cards danced grotesquely . " Have to take it ? Heck , do n't you think John Castro had that all figured out before he ever picked up that gun and shot Tamp Gordy ? " " I did n't say he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very smart man . Now he 's got his own hired hand toting the sheriff 's star  --  and just when you thought you could grab off the job , too , Nels . " Antrade spread his boots on the carpet and rubbed one of his gun butts hard . He was on the verge of exploding . " And that clang Eberly as deputy , too ! How in tarnation did he put that over , huh ? " Barrat shrugged his flesh-laden shoulders . " It was all legal and according to form . Eberly , it seems , had been on the payroll all the time as the deputy of Levi Raye . Sorta a man working undercover . Leastwise , Raye ai n't around to deny it . " Rising , Nels Antrade walked over to the flyspecked window , elbowing aside one of the yellowed grimy curtains . " The new sheriff , this Smith , he accepted Eberly all right ? " " He could n't say much after Eberly dropped that breed railroad workman who jumped at him with a knife when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lost Pinto by the river .  | Smith walked in there figuring he was working alone . He packs nerve . " " Meaning Castro 's got the deck stacked against us now from the sheriff 's office , too , " Antrade said huskily . " Why , we 're all supposed to be in it together , on Castro 's side , " Barrat said gently . " Together ? Then why did n't he consult us on his plans for a new sheriff ? I 'm no fool . John Castro 's the breed who has no permanent friends  --  only his own interests , always and forever . " " Why not ask him why he did n't consult us , Antrade ? " The yellow-haired stocky ex-gunman wheeled . " Ask ? I 'd like to call John Castro and ? " He was eaten by his suspicions of the man . " You 'd like to shoot down Castro , would n't you ? " Antrade frowned , eyes twisting in his head . Then he shook his head . " I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two up his sleeve or in the hole . Aces , too . He ai n't lived this long by luck , and he 's liked . There 're little gents in this country whom he 's lent fifty or a hundred to at the bank  --  on practically no security more'n an honest look . Plenty of them notes he 's never called , too . " Antrade paced the carpet jerkily , a man accustomed to blunt  | violent action by the training of his past , and now compelled to think , weigh , and measure . Nodding vaguely , Barrat leaned forward and poured him a fresh drink and leaned back , panting with the effort . Antrade went on . " No , I ai n't no fool . Shoot him  --  and I 'd have to hit the out-trails again . Live like a scared rat , hunted . Holed up in some mangy hideout . Maybe a fresh thousand in your jeans  --  and no place to spend it because there 's no place you can go . No place where some hungry-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd look with a hole in it . Oh , no . Not for me . Not that  --  again . I 'd kill Castro , and then I 'd have to run and ... " His voice trailed off . He seized the drink Barrat had poured and slammed it down . Barrat rubbed one of his chins . " Maybe Castro could be eliminated . Eberly 's doing duty in the sheriff 's office now and ? " " And there 's that sheriff , Smith . He 's John Castro 's man . There 's him to figure . " " You 're a-fearing him , Nels ? " Nels Antrade snorted . Pushing aside the bottle , he leaned across the table , stemming one hand on it . " You 're the smart gambler , are n't you , Barrat ? Always playing the percentage and never showing your own hand . "  | Barrat smiled suavely . " I like to win . I usually do . " " Sure , sure . " The blood pulsed like a red wave behind Antrade 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what you 're a-trying to do now  --  prod me into a mad move . You 'd like to see me ? " " Have I said anything ? " Barrat sighed , leaning back . " No . But ? " " You and I are going to cut down Castro 's power . If anything happens to you , I 'm that much weakened . Ai n't I ? " " Mebbe . But if ? " " I said Castro could be eliminated  --  maybe . But it 'd have to be done step by step . As you just said , there 's the sheriff , Smith . Now he 's a gunslinger slicker'n slobbers . Bucking him outright would be lining you or me plumb up against the Law . And taking one goldarn big chance . But . . . " Barrat paused to pour himself a drink though he did n't take more than a sip of it . He saw that Antrade had guessed his game and now was cannily tacking . " But  --  get him out of the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know you ai n't a danged bit afraid of Castro or this Smith . If you had to call Smith , why you would . "  | Relaxing , Antrade put a boot up on the chair . " In my day , I been through too much to sweat about another man getting me . But before , you said that maybe I was ? " " What I 'm saying is , Nels , that there 's more'n one way to skin a mule . So there 's more than one way to eliminate this Smith from the deck that Castro has stacked . " " How ? " Antrade 's nostrils flared suspiciously again . " I aim to live to enjoy the fruits of any big play I make . " " Suppose this Smith got killed by the Silver Kid . " " What ? Are you locoed ? The real Kid , Strant himself , is a-traipsing somewheres around this country , and that 's got me nervous . Gotch , one of the bogus Kids , is dead . And Brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sashaying around and reporting only to Castro himself . " " So what ? " said Barrat , plucking a watch from a pocket of his flowery vest . " That do n't concern our plans . " " What are they ? " " That this Smith is outa town , some place up the north part of the Pothole , a-hunting this Kid . Then Smith gets shot down , and we say the Kid himself did it . It 'll all fit like a hand in a glove . "  | Antrade shook his head , puzzled . " We ' say ? ? " " Sure . We 'll be there . We 'll see that he is shot down . I can get some gun toughs . You got some . Henderson 's Gulch is a nice quiet spot for it ; nobody much around in that sandhill . We was there because we was on the trail of the K.id , too . Let Castro worry whether it was the real Kid or that Brothers . " He snorted a laugh . " We just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carried out feet first  --  very dead . Too , too bad . " All truculence gone , Antrade scratched at his yellow hair . " I do n't get it . How do we know this Smith will be there ? " Barrat rose from his bed . " When you rode the out-trails , Antrade , you were never leader of a bunch , were you ? You just followed along . " " Yeah , I was no leader . Why ? " " I was just wondering . Well , we know this Smith will be there , Antrade , because we 'll see that he gets the tip the Kid is due to appear in Henderson 's Gulch . Sabe ? " Nels Antrade began to grin , nodding . Going down the hall , the swaggering Antrade said he had been thinking about something . " It 's this , Barrat . When this Solo Strant does finally slope in , he 'll be branded such a lobo it 'll be plumb legal  | for any man to throw down on him . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barrat 's eyes sank thoughtfully into the fat folds of his face . " Jumping kangaroos , but I 'd like to see the Kid and this Smith tangle .... "  | For the third time in the last hour that queer sense of prescience sent the Kid 's hand to the place at his throat where the little silver skull usually hung . He could n't throw off the premonition that trouble was in the offing . But as he rounded the bend in the trail , head bent against the stinging waves of dust driven by the gusty wind from the south , he saw nobody . The stage track stretched ahead drably , running at the base of a bare slope . Off to the right stood a fallen-in , deserted soddy of some former squatter . Down behind it a thin trickle of brackish water crawled between yellow clay banks like a lazy snake in the shallow gully . There did n't seem to be another human critter in a hundred miles . His thoughts returned to the thing that had been lurking in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . It was about Barrat . The Kid felt he knew him . From when or where , he could n't say , but their trails had crossed somewhere in the  | past . And if he once placed this Barrat , he might have some trailsign to work from . Things were getting worse in a hurry . Just before dusk last night he had come upon a bunch in a draw about to string up a forty-year-old , tubercular gent as the Kid . The poor devil did wear a black shirt and his shooting irons had silver filigree designs on the stocks . In a barroom shooting row he had accidentally nicked a man across the hand with a slug . It was the Kid 's own bullet sign , the lynchers claimed . The victim , a man named Tinker , protesting his innocence , said he was heading for the Pothole to see some old friends , George and Eben Grew . When he said that , the Kid knew he was n't even the gent posing as him , the killer who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pothole of late would have known the Grew brothers were dead . There had been a brief shooting brush before he got the accused man free . And then , this very morning , he had encountered a hoeman coming down the line with a blanketwrapped body in a wagon . His story was bleak . The body , he told stonily , was that of his brotherin-law in from the East on a visit . Getting off the stage at the crossroads , the brother-in-law had asked if the hoeman had left a message for him , giving his  | own name as Mulford Strant . . . . Strant , the same handle as the Kid 's . That had done the damage . When he emerged from the restaurant , five men had thrown down on him from hiding , shot him down . When his hat had fallen off and they saw he was bald as a turkey egg  --  therefore not the Kid  --  they had fled . It was ugly . The country was going crazy . For the first time Solo Strant comprehended completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning he had simply been out to track down the hombre , or hombres as he now knew , who had been impersonating him . He had planned to take him alive to learn who hired him . But now he realized the Pothole was going locoed , haywire . Driven by intermixed hate and terror for the apparent Kid who had gone bad , men were going off like half-cocked guns with hair triggers . Beserk . A wave of fury was fast mounting to a bloody witch hunt . He had to hang the deadwood on this bogus Kid pronto  --  before somebody dumped a corner of hell into the Pothole . In Henderson 's Gulch might be the answer . That was where he was headed now . He had received two tips that the sham Kid was due to slip in there on the morrow , that he had a friend there who would hide him out . The fact that the second tip had been in the form of a note  | left with a bartender by a trail-rider who feared to show his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick of knowing the whereabouts of men of their own ilk , and even lobos , Solo had discovered , despised and hated this Kid who had seemingly gone bad . This pasear to the Gulch was a last resort . He had quietly slipped out to Sadie 's place where Levi Raye had been slain , but it had been boarded up . Neighbors down the road told him Sadie had packed her belongings and trekked out of the country . The Kid 's eyes got sleepier-looking . He could n't afford any slip-ups in Henderson 's Gulch if the sham Kid appeared ... . Henderson 's Gulch was like a piece of rangeland that had gone barren . Nels Antrade decided that as he sat slouched in a booth of what had once been a booming dance-hall barroom . Not so many years ago Henderson 's Gulch had been a prosperous hell-roaring place , a stopover on the old cattledrive out of the Pothole . That was before John Castro had gone to work , raised a fund and pulled strings in the State legislature and gotten the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it was an easy drive in a straight line to the nearest shipping point for cattle . And soon , with the railroad spur coming in , the loading pens  | would be smack in Garson itself . The Gulch was like an aged man , a skeleton of a thing compared with its lush past , clinging to the last breath of life . Antrade sloshed himself a drink out of the bottle before him , hands twitching . His nerves were getting him , he admitted . Like a canker , for weeks now , a persistent hunch had been growing in him that it was either him or John Castro . That Castro would sacrifice another man to his ends  --  as he had Tamp Gordy  --  when the moment was ripe . And somehow Nels Antrade , ex-outlaw , knew he was that man . But soon , in a matter of an hour or so at the most , he would swing into action , and Castro 's strength would be cut heavily . For they were going to cut down his sheriff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shot of raw whiskey , coughed , and at once sloshed another glassful from the bottle . He needed his redeye these days . It was n't that he was going yellow ; he just could n't stand this inaction . He knew that Castro was scheming and pulling strings and working toward his obscure ends . Like putting this ace gunner , Smith , in office . While he , Antrade , had always been used to facing a man square in the open and calling on him to fill his hand and getting it done with . But they 'd be doing soon . Outside the town , Barrat  | waited with the little bunch . Barrat had some trigger slammers who worked for him on the quiet , and with them were some of Nels Antrade 's own most dependable men , some he 'd hired in from the outside just lately . This Smith would come and shortly after they 'd sweep in , yelling for the Silver Kid . And Smith would be gunned down in the confusion . Antrade himself had come into town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . They had to get working on Castro fast , and no slip-ups . Some private information he had made him know why . " John killed Levi Raye , I knew . He boasted of it to me when he was blind with rage and wanted to show me how big he was . And  --  there are others , too  --  killings that have been blamed on Jus Lamotte and his bunch , just like Raye 's murder . John does n't know that I know about these . He was drinking hard one night in the living room , so drunk he never saw me in the doorway . He was talking to himself like a mad man . He 's killed a lot  --  or had them killed ? that nobody knows about . . . . " Antrade could hear the woman 's voice like an echo as she told him that that night in the backroom up in the Old Town . He could smell her perfume , too , just as it had dizzied his senses that night .  | " You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean if there was out and out trouble ! He does n't own you  --  or his bank either . You would n't be afraid of him , would you ? " she had gone on , smiling alluringly over the top of her glass . He could hear her saying that again , too . Knew , as he had at the moment , that she was seeing how far she could prod him toward calling John Castro . Oh , Tuck Barrat had n't been the only one who had sounded him out ; Antrade had wondered why she wanted Castro dead . She 'd said Castro beat her , but he had n't believed her . Even if he did , it was something deeper than that in her that wanted Castro killed . It ? He blinked and realized that the man he had left on guard at the back door of the place stood beside the booth . Otherwise the barn of a place was somnolent and hollow with that dead empty feeling . " What 's the matter , Al ? " Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Boss , there 's a woman out back . Says she wants to talk to you . " " A woman ? By grab  --  say , who is it ? " Then he saw Al 's eyes twisted away in his head , saw him shrug . Al knew but knew , too , he was n't supposed to know . Antrade cursed in that husky whisper , jackknifing his body up out of the booth , then letting  | it drop onto the seat . It was as if his thoughts ? his very recalling her words  --  had summoned her here . " Bring her in , Al . " Then she was there , smiling enigmatically down at him . He tried to scowl against the smile . " Are you locoed , coming here , Diane ? " He saw the door in the back corner close on Al 's long back . " Why , it ai n't even respectable , you , a woman , a-coming into a place like this . " She laughed softly , twitching the quirt against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any man crazy enough to say she is n't  --  well , he 'd better get clear of this country very fast . John is very proud of me , his dearest possession , " she ended with a curling lip . " Everybody 's afraid of John Castro , are n't they ? " Abruptly Nels Antrade felt the heat of the sultry windless afternoon . A knot began to tighten inside him and he wanted to curse her for coming here now , when he had to keep himself clear-headed and cold , deadly cold . But he could n't swear at her , not as she stood there so provocatively in the white whipcord riding breeches and the powder-blue shirt whose silk moulded itself to her body . And the yellow hair falling over her shoulders . He rose and she slipped into the seat and he sat down opposite her . " How in tarnation did you  | know where I was ? " he said with that thin hoarseness . She chuckled . " The breed girl at your place  --  the one who cooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face grew darker , whitening around the lips with embarrassment . Then he got scared . Suppose John Castro had found out , too . Suppose Castro had trailed her here ; he knew Smiling John was as jealous as blazes . She apparently read his mind . " It 's all right . John thinks I 've gone to visit some friends up north , the McGregors who have the horse ranch up beyond the Pass . " " Oh . " He pushed the whiskey bottle away . " But you should n't be here . My men ai n't fools . They ? " Then he saw that she was tensed up , too , and scared , saw it by the way her fingers tore slowly at the braided leather of the quirt . She 'd had some big reason for following him here . She lifted her head , giving him the full battery of her eyes . " Nels , John is importing more gunmen , big ones . On the quiet . They slip into the ranch at night and they 're never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged . " Your husband 's afraid of that Kid they have n't caught yet . He might bob up anywheres  --  any time . " He put his teeth together hard .  | That was a thing he did n't let himself think about , this real Silver Kid who had vanished after escaping hanging at Misery Flats . Maybe he 'd pulled stakes and quit the Pothole . Antrade did n't know and refused to speculate . Castro was the real concrete menace in the picture now , and if that Kid should turn up , Castro would sacrifice them first . Them .. . him . But Diane Castro shook her head . " Actually he believes that if this Kid should appear , Smith , his sheriff , will handle him . No . It 's something else . He knows there 's a real bust-up building in the Pothole . " Antrade raked his yellow hair back from his low forehead and waited . Diane leaned across the table . " Nels , the Anchor-T and the Box-A would just about be the whole Pothole together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , nobody else would dare buck it . . . . Did I ever tell you ? By John 's will ? when he dies  --  everything is mine ! " She sat breathless when she finished . Slowly but crushingly his hand on the table clamped into a rocky fist . Everything be too danged civilized . What the devil ! Why be afraid of killing John Castro , just so long as he could do  | it ? That was the answer . Burn him down . Maybe nobody would ever find out he had done it . If they did , for defense , he could throw up the killings Diane had said Castro had committed . Why He jumped to his feet . The heck with this Sheriff Smith , Castro 's man . So long as Castro lived , there was danger . With Castro dead . . . He half turned , planning to leave , and collided with Al . Al said : " Barrat just sent in a message . This Smith ai n't coming in . He 's already in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yep . One of Barrat 's men learned it , so they 'll be swinging in right soon and hitting . Barrat says for you to watch from here and be ready to spot Smith when he appears when the trouble starts . " It was too late to change now . Too late to walk out and go get Castro . Antrade dropped back into the booth . Diane studied him coldly , unblinkingly , in the dimness , bending to peer under his hat brim . " What 's happening , Nels ? " He shook his head . " You 've got to get clear of here pronto . We have reason to think the Kid  --  the real Kid  --  is going to be around . There 'll be a fight . I  --  you got to go . " A spur scraped faintly . Antrade 's eyes jumped  | up and across the long room , and suddenly he was glad he had slapped on his big-brimmed hat . For Smith , the sheriff , stood lounging against the bar counter in the dimness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the bar . He stood watching the road through the open half of the double doors , his gray-clad bit of body looking even frailer and smaller in the poor light . Antrade sucked air and moved his feet and hands without noise , getting set . This was it , he told himself . Then he froze in his half twisted position . For , he realized that Smith 's eyes kept shifting to the mirror in which he could watch Antrade in the booth . The latter released his breath slowly . He felt Smith had been watching him before he discovered Smith 's presence . Yet Smith had n't recognized him ; he would have called out if he had . Antrade waited . Smith was toying with something metallic on the bar , something he had pulled from a pocket . Antrade could hear it click against the counter edge as he rolled it back and forth unconsciously . Diane leaned toward him aga . " Are you afraid if  --  that if  --  well , if John got killed  --  his bank would close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut up . " Antrade jerked his head back so he could watch the sheriff . Beneath the table , Antrade 's  | fingers curled and uncurled and curled on a gun butt . " No , " he answered her jerkily in his husky voice . " No . I 'm clean with the bank . " He wondered about his next move . There was something about this Smith , some lethal aura , that held him pinned to the seat . Something that told him Smith was a walking hunk of dynamite . The back door slapped and he heard Al 's heels hitting . Antrade rose and switched his back to the bar quickly and went rearward to head off Al . Smith must n't become suspicious . When he came back from Al , Diane was out of the booth . She came toward him . It was half dark in there with evening approaching and the blackbrowed heavens seeming to lower right over the tops of the unpainted buildings . " Get back , " he whispered . " That 's John 's man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? Where ? " She shook her head . " I do n't know . I just looked once  --  and he was n't there any more . Nels ? " A single flat report came from the sage at the end of the town in the gulch . The signal . They would be coming in . He told her to get out quickly . Then a premonition like a cold stone plunging down inside his chest seized him . He turned and grabbed her and held her tight , kissed her hard and long .  | Diane Castro jerked away , mouth twisting as if she had tasted something bitter . Nels Antrade smiled crookedly , held her gloved hand hard . " Might n't see you for a long time , Diane , " he whispered , knowing even as he said it that he would never kill John Castro . Then he spun on his heel and went for the front . From the end of the town came blurred yelling and the rumble of fast hoofs . They were coming . He glided through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar , to where Smith had been standing . Her quick hand scooped up the metal thing with which he had been playing . Then she left by the back door ... .  | Watching the decaying sleepy town out of the front door , the Kid had seen something , something that at first he was afraid to believe . Up behind the other side of the street on the big mound of rubble and stone gathered at the base of the gulch wall , a man leading a pony had darted across the gap in the brush and stunted growth of jack pine ; that man had been garbed in black , topped with a black sombrero , with silver trappings sparkling faintly in the weak light . The bogus Kid ! Solo Strant stiffened his fingers against the electric tingling in them , stood motionless , watching , as the drops of cold sweat dribbled down his backbone . Impatience was a caged animal inside him , clawing and spitting , but he kept the check rein hard on himself . It was n't as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell 's corral . He had to take him alive , this second impersonator , because the very fact that there had been two proved they were hired hands .  | He felt his shirt to be certain he had removed his lawman 's badge . He did n't want to be spotted as the sheriff hereabouts . When he had hired the room upstairs to stay out of sight , he had told the proprietor merely that his name was Smith , saying it as if it were the handle a wanted man had taken . He kept his dreamy-looking eyes on the clump of brush behind which the black-clad man had vanished . " It 's him , " he said under his breath . " Him . . . . " There was an open space on the other side of the clump . The man had n't crossed it yet . He was in the brush , peering down and sizing up the street , perhaps . To step out that front door now might scare him off . Remembering the side door off the hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged in the side lot . Big eaves cast a thick shadow and he advanced in the screen of it ; then that gun popped down at the edge of the town . The Kid cursed silently as he held his breath . A few minutes before an orey-eyed coot had ridden out on a burro . Maybe it was he . The seconds crept . The man up on the mound at the foot of the gulch wall scuttled across the open space . He did n't have his pony with him now , had left it groundanchored  | behind him . He did n't appear again , but some fifty yards on two birds fluttered hurriedly from a clump of alders and the Kid knew where his man was . The Kid came out of the alley and eased along close to the buildings like an idler . Then he saw where his man was headed . It was a patched-up , three-room shanty out from the town a bit , perched on the lip of a dry wash . Arriving at the Gulch early for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , learned that a tubercular ex-gambler and his halfwitted daughter lived there . He had even seen the girl , a beautiful brunette with a vacant look cursing a Madonnalike face . Foliage up from the place near the debris at the foot of the gulch side shook and parted slightly on the windless air . The sham Silver Kid was there . The real Kid was a-tremble with the itch to settle with this blood-letting impostor of himself , to pay him off in his own coin . By crossing the street and passing up an alley , he could dash between the man and his pony and then smoke it out to a bitter end . But he had to find out who was behind his game , the hidden one . His steely nerves took control and he was already figuring how he could bellywriggle along the dry wash and ?  | There was a shout from down the road behind , some unintelligible outcry . He glanced back hurriedly , noting a couple of lank men on the dirt path beside the road . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bend down by the lightning-riven tree too , but he paid them no heed , intent on the fugitive he was stalking . " The Kid ! That blasted Silver Kid ! " somebody bellowed . " We got him cornered , boys ! Smoke him out ! Blow the place sky-high ! " And shots smashed atop the words like some murderous tocsin . Strant 's instinctive reaction saved his pelt . It was a mistake , but it kept him alive . On impulse , he took them to mean him , naturally . The next instant , even as his hands slashed up , gun-filled , he was diving and rolling into the belly-high grass of an open lot . Then the town seemed to take fire . Riders came pounding in from either end . Two men slid out from the side of a cabin down a little way and across the road , gun hammers eared back . " I got the lowdown sonuva ? " an hombre close by crowed , and his hoglegs blasted the spot where the Kid would have been had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slammed out of a path in the open lot where the Kid had leaped . They were coming in from all sides , jerking a noose on the town .  | The Kid 's eyes twisted up to the rubble heap where the sham Kid had been lurking . Bitterness ran like gall in his veins as he saw the man backtracking at top speed to where he had left his pony hidden .  | It was a raid all right . Some of the riders from the far end of the road pulled up in a swirl of dust before a boarded-up abandoned cabin up a path from the general store . They poured lead into it as they cut back and forth . Solo Strant thought he had it figured then . Even as he recognized stocky yellowheaded Nels Antrade stepping from behind a tree back by the barroom . He had reacted instinctively when he heard the call go up for the " Kid , " taken it for granted they meant him . But apparently they too had been tipped off this bogus murdering Kid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . They did n't seem to realize the quarry was escaping at the very moment not more than a few hundred feet away . So Strant added it up . Leaping out from the cover of high grass , he bellowed and waved . He dashed into the middle of the road , and then went flat in the dust for his life . A man in an alley across the street had opened up on him . The deadly cool Kid worked a hogleg  | out before him and triggered twice . He sent two slugs droning low over the other 's head , forcing him to retreat . But at once , bullets kicked up dust jets a scant yard from Strant 's outflung legs . He could n't savvy it but was already rolling and threshing up alkali to screen himself . " There he is ! There he is ! " somebody bawled . A horseman thundered down upon Strant . The rider emptied his Colts downward as he flung by but missed , unable to pick out the Kid in the billowing dust . Giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elbow and put a hunk of lead dead center between the man 's shoulder blades . Before the toppling rider was clear of the hull , the Kid was up and darting zigzag fashion , doubled over for cover . He wondered if they had gone locoed . In his gray rig he looked nothing like the Kid they knew . He seemed to be at the core of a welter of slithering lead . A hot gust of wind whipped down the street , ushering a blinding wall of dust before it . That alone saved Strant then . Just before he was lost in it the man at the door of the barroom missed with two shots . Strant knew the tiny town was ringed in . There was no avenue of escape , and no chance of making himself heard in the uproar . He stumbled backing over a broken down fence . There was a charred burnt-out shell of cabin before it . He  | leaped through a gap in the black wall . But the dust cloud had passed on downhill . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gouging the fire-gutted ruins with their lead . Gray sombrero back on his shoulders , Strant answered them , the hardware bucking in his slim hands . His face wore that dead Sphinxlike look . His eyes were drowsy slits but in the backs of them hell 's own fire was reflected . He wasted no time in sentimentality about burning down innocent but mistaken hombres . It was a case of living or dying , and he preferred to keep breathing . Guns extended at arm 's length , he rode the triggers . One rider turned away , shrieking , with a smashed forearm . Another hit the dust bouncing and staggered away drunkenly as his hammerhead went down under him . They passed and the din lessened a moment . In the lull the Kid caught the snap of wood . He spun to see a gunman skinning through a gap in the side wall of the burnt-out building . The other shot wildly , but his slug caromed off a beam and the flattened chunk of steel gouged a patch of flesh from the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to flood up over that little segment of the world . Terror clawed at his heart and he wondered if he was to be sightless again . He felt his hoglegs slide from powerless  | fingers that had turned to water . In another second the gent would cut him down like a fish in a barrel . Strant slid sideward , breaking deliberately at the knees . A piece of steel purred with the whisper of death past his shoulder . Then he had swiped the blood from his forehead and could see through the gathering gloom . The gunman , faceless in it , came toward him , laughing chillily . He figured he had plenty of time . Strant 's left arm whipped inside his shirt where his second silver-stocked weapon was in a shoulder rig . A split second stood between him and a yawning Boot Hill hole . There was that blinding-fast gliding motion . Then the third gun swept up and out to arm 's legth with a sure calm . Muzzle flame twinkled from the two opposing weapons , and the gunman left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a bullet smack between the eyes . His carcass still clattered back among charred fragments of an inner wall as Strant bent and scooped up his fallen weapons . Only a few weapons were snapping at the thin front of the fire-gutted cabin when he wheeled to face the road again . It was almost night . They were creeping in on him . He knew he had little chance against that bunch closing from all sides . The comparative stillness was smashed by the hot  | drum of pony hoofs . The Kid dimly made out a band of horsemen swinging into the Gulch settlement . And there was a fresh barrage of lead with their advent . Two of the attacking outfit leaped up from the road and began to flee . One of them buckled in the middle , bellying forward as if struck an invisible blow that had broken his back . Then he hit the alkali . The charge of the newcomers was stemmed momentarily as the gun bunch in the town sent the lead rider pitching from the saddle . The Kid jumped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . He was just in time to see the yellow head of Nels Antrade , now hatless , as he whirled and ran back along the path toward the barroom . Antrade was getting out . The Kid levered up one of his guns uncertainly . He still could n't figure Antrade 's role . Beyond Antrade , a figure appeared in the doorway of the barroom briefly . Holding the door open behind him , he was revealed in the flood of lamplight from within , vast , huge-girthed , a face that was layers of pinkish flesh . It was Tuck Barrat . And Solo Strant knew from where he remembered him then , understood the clue of the heavy voice rumbling from the depths of his hulk . Barrat was the man who 'd taken charge when he , Solo , had  | walked in on that card game in the backroom of the Misery Flats saloon . The man he 'd seen in a flickering flash before his vision faded in the lamplight . The man who 'd turned him over to the local John Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Lamotte ! " The cry came from several quarters , shrill and fear-freighted . Men began to run for their lives in the gloom . A rider , slim and willowy in the saddle of a powerful stallion so big it made its cargo seem like a child , swept down the center of the road . The Kid had a glimpse of the black mask beneath the sombrero . Jus Lamotte . Barrat stepped back from the saloon doorway , pulling the door partially closed after him , but not shutting it . Then he and the doorway were swallowed as the light inside was extinguished.The Kid 's eyes went away from there as he backed against a building to keep clear of the raging criss-crossing gunfire . He leaped forward to chop down with a gun barrel on the head of one of the first bunch . The man , fleeing , brought up short , rocking on his heels . The Kid waited for him to drop , figuring here was a prisoner who might have some of the answers later . But before the man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his brains . He was dead before his boots upended .  | Down in the barroom , Tuck Barrat restationed himself in the half open door in the dimness . The retreating Antrade 's bright head came closer . Antrade was backing now , sidling along , guns ready . " Unfortunate , " Barrat wheezed to himself . Then his ham of flesh that was a hand steadied with a gun . There was no alternative ; the thing had failed . He could n't trust the impetuous Antrade not to talk later . Also , a very silent Antrade could be his alibi to John Castro . " So long , Nels , " Barrat said ; then he pulled the trigger twice . Ten feet from the bar door , the onetime swaggering Antrade sank . Tuck Barrat took a couple of strides and poured two more slugs into the downed figure . Nels Antrade 's whisper would never again be heard on this earth . Barrat vanished back inside the bar and nodded to the giant Bustard in the dimness . They left by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of Antrade 's Box-A outfit through the bank either . Barrat had known what he was doing when he had lent Nels money to clean up his bank notes .... It was over as suddenly as if a curtain had been dropped on the scene . A few guns still snapped down the gulch , and a riderless pony , wounded , galloped blindly up and down the road with the  | slipped saddle banging beneath its belly . The baffled Kid stood in the right angle formed by the steps to the porch of a shuttered store . " Been having a spell of warm weather , huh , Smitty ? " The Kid twisted and there was stumpy , childishfaced Frisco Morgan leaning over the porch railing above . " What the devil are you doing ? " Strain started to say stupidly from surprise . Frisco blew at a smoking gun muzzle and clumped down off the porch . He inspected a torn shirt sleeve ruefully . " Oh , just strayed in to look up a spinster aunt who 's been down with the hives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave any forwarding address ? " Strant asked , taking up Frisco on his mood . The Kid felt somewhat dizzy from the flesh wound in his head , but he could n't remember ever being gladder to see anybody than he was Frisco , somehow . " Nope . She gets on one of those vanilla-extract jags of hers and just gallops off to hell ' n gone . " He had the Kid 's arm and they were moving . Strant asked where they were going . Frisco said , " Oh , there might be a little flare-back . You been a target enough for one day . " He steered the way off on a side path and they came out on a little knoll with a single yellow pine  | capping it . From there they commanded a view of the single street of the Gulch settlement . Strant remembered the bogus Kid and started forward , but with night closing in rapidly he knew it was too late to do anything about him then . Frisco 's big hand had clamped on his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Strant snapped impatiently . " I ai n't one to let somebody else do my gunsmoking for me ! I ? " " Easy . " Frisco stood staring past him at nothing . " You got smart guns , Smitty . But the best guns ca n't do no thinking for you when somebody sets a trap . " " Trap ? That killing Kid was here . I came to get him . So did some others  --  maybe .... Well , I 'm not sure but . . . Hey , who could 've set a trap for me ? " Frisco shrugged , spinning a gun by a trigger guard . " There were a couple of cartridge explosions down the Gulch . I do n't know . You 're working for pay  --  for gents on the other side of the fence from my kind now , you know , Smitty . " It was almost an accusation . The Kid took down the wadded bandanna he 'd been holding against his head and gripped Frisco 's faded shirt with his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He spoke very softly . Solo Strant  | was very mad . " No . Nothin ' to tell . You hit the trail this way , and things did n't smell so good . No , Smitty . " He toed dirt . " We  --  me an ' my friends  --  we did n't hear nothing about any Kid  --  this one you talk about ? being here .... " " You 've been watching me , eh , Frisco ? " Frisco whistled gently , a tuneless refrain . " Why did Lamotte and the outfit buy chips ? " " We see other fellas take this same trail you ride . Maybe it do n't look so good . I  --  anyway , Lamotte gets the word and drifts up . Maybe Lamotte figures he owes you a little debt like . Yeah . That 's it . " He looked at the sky . " Wo n't rain . Wanta bet two bits ? " Strant swore huskily . Frisco would n't tell him anything . It was like batting around in a fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frisco did n't trust him much , he realized . " I 'm going to look into this and ? " " Do n't , Smitty . . . . " Frisco 's Colt had ceased to twirl and its levelled muzzle nudged Strant 's back . The Kid laughed softly . " You would n't drill me . " " I got my orders from Lamotte . Snakes in the grass lay low , Smitty . You got you skin whole now and ? "  | " Thanks to Lamotte . " " So keep your britches on and stay here . Them 's Lamotte 's orders . " A man 's shout floated back on the evening wind . A little eddy of dust went dancing along the road through the light from a lamp that had been cautiously lighted in a house . " How 'd you get that handle of yours  --  Frisco ? You from out that way ? " the Kid said apropos of nothing . Frisco chuckled and broke it off short . " Nope . Got a girl out there . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " The Kid 's glance had dropped to the gun in Frisco 's hand . Frisco 's eyes lowered to it also . Both of them saw the scar of the Kid 's bullet on the back of Frisco 's hand . They both looked elsewhere embarrassedly . " When do you figure to go back to Frisco and see her ? " " Some things are a gent 's private business , " Frisco said softly . " I could n't go back there  --  because I never been there , Smitty . . . . " There was a sharp whistle , three descending notes , from the edge of town . Frisco lowered his gun and answered it . " Got the makin 's , Smitty ? " The Kid used his hands to draw tobacco sack and matches from his pockets . Frisco , smiling roguishly , plucked the Kid 's hoglegs from his holsters as his hands were busy . " I 'll leave ' em down on that stump  | we passed where the path turns off , Smitty . Hasta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " His voice was wistful , then harsh as he popped , " So long . " And he strode off into the dark . Strant understood the harshness was because he was packing a tin badge . Later , down in the barroom of the town left by both bunches of raiders , he lifted a second drink . The barkeep had plastered a piece of bandage over his head cut . The redeye , hot and fiery , sent fresh strength pulsing through the veins of his lithe wiretough body . He slid a hand into a trouser pocket . The silver skull he had been carrying there was gone ... .  | It was like sitting on the lid of a volcano . Solo Strant felt that way as he turned onto the main street of Garson with Smiling John Castro . They were on their way back form the funeral parlor where the body of Nels Antrade , brought back from Henderson 's Gulch , was laid out . " Yes-siree , Garson City 's going to be big , big like nobody 's dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castro was saying . Eyes puckered against the sting of the glowering ball of midday sun , Strant the sheriff scarcely heard . Squatting on the lid of a volcano was the only way to describe it , his thoughts ran . A lid beneath which hidden fires licked and blood welled , blood that threatened to become a tide of gore washing over the Pothole . The Kid 's mind travelled back over things . The double raid at Henderson 's Gulch , Antrade getting killed . Then he himself had returned to Garson to run into the news that there had been two new depredations by this bogus Kid . A plow-chaser had  | been shot dead in the door of his soddy and robbed of the few small bills and coins hoarded in a kitchen pot . And a stage depot on the trail north had been shot up , the stableman wounded , before the man accurately described as the Kid had been driven off . He had stupidly and viciously slain half a dozen horses before he had left . He seemed to be killcrazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was en route to the Gulch , and the second shortly after he had seen the bogus Kid in his attempt to skulk into the Gulch . But that did n't help any . He had hustled up-trail to the stage depot but the trail was dead . The marauder had been last seen heading across Ring Anderson 's range , then vanished . Strant and Castro rounded the corner and pushed through the throng before the traveling dentist 's tent and neared the jailhouse . The Kid 's thoughts swung back to the undertaker 's place where Antrade lay . " I 've taken over the White Horse bar and it 'll be free drinks for everybody after the funeral , " Castro mentioned , as his thoughts paralleled the sheriff 's . " Nels was a fine fellow , a fine fellow . Impulsive , yes , but I 'll miss him . " Castro said it as would a victor referring to a vanquished rival .  | The Kid led the way in the door of his office , feeling the cool relief as the sun left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little haggard around the eye sockets . He dropped down behind his desk , seeing Antrade 's laid-out body again . And the bullet scar , clotted with dried blood , on the upper part of the dead man 's hand , running onto the wrist . The undertaker had almost hidden it by pulling down the sleeve cuff of the black suit in which Antrade lay . It was very like the Kid 's own bullet sign , that scar . Yet he knew he had not taken a single shot at Antrade back in the Gulch . Probably an accidental nick by a stray bullet ; nobody else had noticed it . Castro did n't strike the corner of the desk as would another man . In his unimpassioned way , he put the flat of his hand down on it soundlessly but so hard the fingers splayed out fan fashion under the pressure . " Smith , you were hired to hang deadwood on the Lamotte bunch . " " And the Kid , " the Kid came back quietly . " I figured he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulch . On his trail . " His story of the fight in the Gulch on his return had been sketchy . He still did n't know what kind of a game had been going on there , and he could hardly explain that  | the Jus Lamotte bunch had come in to rescue him , a one-time friend of theirs . " Yes , the Kid , ' too , " Castro said . His eyes batted once . He was n't telling all he knew , or thought he knew , either . " So what ? So you went off on a wild goose chase , and while you were gone , your deputy disappeared , undoubtedly the victim of foul play . " He meant Eberly . Castro could have told what had happened to Eberly . Tuck Barrat had told him . Drunken , Eberly had done some bragging in a place up in the Old Town . He 'd let slip how Nels Antrade had baited a trap for the new sheriff up in Henderson 's Gulch . Barrat had dropped in and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , Eberly had tried to get him ; Barrat had killed him . That was Tuck Barrat 's story to Castro . Barrat , according to the rest of his story , had hit the trail to try to warn the sheriff , had arrived in the midst of the shooting to see the sheriff escape . " That 's a double-crosser out of the picture , " had been John Castro 's calm comment . He had always been afraid the impetuous gun-liking Antrade would take the bit in his own teeth sometime . The loss of Eberly meant little to him . Most folks thought Eberly was his gun ace and bodyguard .  | Castro knew that Eberly was a lazy work-dodger who was merely cold-blooded and very efficient at trigger work . Castro had paid him only ten dollars per month more than an ordinary bunk-house hand . The Kid had built and fired up a quirly . He said , " You say a goose chase , Castro ? Suppose I tell you I saw that Kid in the Gulch . " Castro 's eyes blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was as sure I 'd never hang . " Casually Castro poked a fly speck on the wall calendar , and though he gave no sign , something told the Kid that Castro was surprised , taken aback . " Get a shot at him ? " Strant said no with a shake of his head . " I would have captured him if that shooting melee had n't busted out . Antrade was there ; so was that Barrat . " " They got a tip the Kid was nosing around too . The second outfit was probably the Lamotte bunch working with that snake of a Kid , most likely . " He stood up . " Do n't worry none about capturing the Kid next time you cut his trail sign . Kill him ! Blast him down ! Do n't give him no warnin ' any more than you 'd apologize to a sidewinder before cutting off its head . Blast him and fill him with lead and leave him for buzzard bait . " His always masked eyes rested on the Kid for several moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamp on the Kid , hold him in an intimidating grip  --  or a would-be intimidating grip . Then Castro left . The Kid listened to his boot heels rattle down the steps and slid a paper from the desk drawer . On it there were four names he had written down . They were Tuck Barrat and Pole Johnson of the Scissors outfit . Nels Antrade was third . Fourth was Ring Anderson . They were the four big brand owners in the Pothole besides Castro . Strant crossed out the dead Antrade 's name . And at the bottom of the list he added another , John Castro 's . Castro had been surprised that the bogus Silver Kid had turned up in the Gulch , which could mean he might know something of the false Kid 's comings and goings . It did n't prove that , but it was a possibility . And after Frisco Morgan had left back in the Gulch , the Kid had come to the decision that whoever was behind this game in the Pothole , it was one of the big gents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much for anybody to be working against them . He ground out his cigarette stub and thought of Tuck Barrat and his recognition of him in the Gulch as the man who had turned him over to the Law in Misery Flats . " But that proves nothing ?  | nothing except that Barrat may be an honest , lawabiding citizen . . . . Exactly what he was doing in the Gulch , him and Antrade . . . " He hit his feet sharply , hand instinctively going to his throat where the silver skull used to hang . Why had those gunmen with Antrade swarmed on him ? The possible answer galvanized him . Was it because Antrade had discovered he , Solo Strant , was the real Kid ? His hand dropped from his throat , started for his pocket where he had been carrying the skull , fisted spasmodically . There was that other thing , the thing that had been in the back of his mind like a crouching threat all the time . The missing skull . If it were ever traced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Sunday best , shoved his head in from the corridor . He spoke twice before Strant realized he was there . The sun was a full two hours past noon now . The Kid sat staring at the cold cup of java before him , a regular heap of quirly butts in the tin plate beside him that served as an ashtray . He had been stall walking , trying to untangle this mystery and determine his next move . He burned to take the initiative and strike . It was n't his way to play a waiting game . " The funeral 's starting up , Sheriff , " Cal croaked again .  | The Kid rose and dragged on his hat over the new patch of bandaging that adorned his skull . He went around the corner and joined the procession , followed Nels Antrade 's coffin up to Garson 's Boot Hill on a ledge to the south of the town and watched them plant him in the shaly soil . A circuit-riding preacher with a voice like a sick bullfrog and one ear cocked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to his next assignment read a service . Barrat yanked the sombrero off a saloon tough who fell asleep against a tree . John Castro patted the head of Antrade 's twelve-year-old nephew , his only heir , and announced to all and sundry that he had lost a great friend and Garson an upstanding citizen . Not to be outdone , Barrat shoved forward and promised a thousand-dollar reward out of his own pocket to the hombre who presented to him information leading to the identification of Antrade 's murderer . Then they went down off the ledge and to one of the byways pushing out from the town . The dust began to seethe in steamy clouds as the returning process became a race , then a blind thirsty-mouthed stampede . The men were racing for the free drinks at the White Horse . The Kid dropped in there with Barrat and John Castro because the latter said it was expected of his official position . They had a  | drink at a table in a side room away from the barbellying mob . Strant calmly dropped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dislike to say this , gentlemen , with Antrade hardly bedded down in his Boot Hill claim , but somebody in the Gulch that day was out to get me . " He rose . " And it was n't the Kid , either . " Barrat and John Castro exchanged a glance . The latter spoke . " Yuh sure , Smith ? " The Kid nodded curtly . " They seemed to take me for this Kid . " John Castro and Barrat looked genuniely puzzled . " I do n't see how that could be . " The Kid shrugged and left ; he had his answer . Neither of them knew he was the Kid anyway . Apparently that lost skull had n't been trailed to him . As far as he could figure this locoed layout , neither Castro nor Tuck Barrat had engineered the attack in the Gulch . He was thinking of the false Kid and his latest crimes as he approached the sheriff 's office . Skin Peters , whom he had appointed as a special deputy and put to guarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back behind the office . Strant saw Old Cal , slightly under the weather , his stiff white collar hooked up over an ear , trying to slip back to the jail unobserved through the weeds . The Kid smiled wearily as he went up the steps .  | These latest depredations of his imitator seemed without plan or reason . The acts of some kind of maniac completely . out of control of whatever master had originally hired him . His eyes blurred momentarily in the dimness of the interior . Then he caught the glitter from the top of his desk . It was the silver skull . The missing one as he saw immediately as he leaped over to it and recognized it by the tiny nick on the right side . He smothered it in his fist and reacting guiltily , flashed a look back to the door to see if he had been seen with it . The tinkle of a spur came from the hallway running to the back room . His hand sliced for the far gun scabbard.  | The face in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious , Solo Strant had ever seen . Vaguely he saw the creamy sombrero above it , the dark blue shirt below it . The level staring eyes were like reflections in ice , the even features bore a stamp of calculated determination that would know no brooking . The Kid had seen a few killers in his time  --  but only a few  --  who had such an aura . There was the swish of a leather riding skirt . " Why , Sheriff , you would n't shoot a woman , would you ? " And Diane Castro came from the corridor , sidling provocatively , lips in a mocking pout . Full light touched her and revealed her dazzling beauty that was like a diaphanous screen . It hid what Strant had seen a moment ago . His left hand came away from his gun as he felt foolish . She extended her hand . " How do you do , Sheriff  --  Smith . I 'm Mrs. John Castro . " Then he realized the skull was squeezed in his right hand . She sat on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quirt through her gloved hands  | like a snake , smiling in that way that defied description . She laughed with that echo of mockery . The Kid said something about her presence being a compliment . " You have a way with women  --  as well as guns ? have n't you , Kid ? " she said softly . He gave no sign , merely lifting an eyebrow from the quirly he built with untrembling fingers . " Kid ? " " You 're the Silver Kid . " He bowed mockingly . " Also Bat Masterson and sometimes known as Clay Allison of the Washita . South of the Border , they call me Pancho Villa for short , too . " She shook her head , the blond hair tucked under a bandanna wrapped around beneath the sombrero . The tip of the quirt splashed slowly again and again over the edge of the desk . " Mr. Solo Strant , do n't waste words in running a two-bit bluff . " There was a harshness in her voice that was ugly . " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nesbitt Forks . I would n't have recognized you in those clothes ? you always wore black . But now that I know who you are , I do recognize you . " " Ma'am , I know the sun has been right strong today . And I might resemble this killing coyote of a Kid in some respects but ? " " You are he . I saw you grab up that silver skull  | from your desk as if you were afraid somebody would see it first . " " It 's the sign of that Kid . It 's been found where he has been and  --  well , he himself might have left it and ? " She sneered . " I put it there , Mr. Strant . " She rose , drawing herself up , gloating in wielding this power over a man . " The last time I saw it was in Henderson 's Gulch . You had it then .... " He remembered  --  he had been unconsciously toying with the skull on the bar as he watched out the door and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he had eased out that side door , forgetting the skull completely and leaving it behind him . He grinned sleepily , nodding . " That 's right . I just recollect now , ma'am . I 'd found it and ? " Her quirt lashed the side of the desk impatiently . " Enough . Castro always said his money could get him anything . And he could even buy your guns , Strant ! I would n't have believed it if I had n't seen it ! " Shrugging , he put a match to his smoke . She walked slowly forward till a bare inch separated them , smiled close into his face . " I hold the aces in the game here in the Pothole  --  though few know it , Mr. Strant . Perhaps we could work together . " Her  | voice became husky and she dropped a hand on his forearm . The touch sent the blood drumming in his temples . " Perhaps . . . you would n't take your orders from Mr. Castro but from ? " The Kid got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your forehead , ma'am . " Then he eased by her and moved a pair of handcuffs on his desk . " I take nobody 's orders . I 'm the Law here and it 's going to be enforced . And I 've never gone in for petticoat justice in my life , ma'am . " Her face blanched . Her eyes became adamant as a pair of pale stones . She jabbed one custom-made boot backward , raking the floor with her spur . Diane Castro was unused to being spurned by a man . Then she went to the door , panting as she spoke over her shoulder . " You  --  you ? " The Kid said casually , " Would you like to go out on that street and try to prove what you think ? " " Calling me , Mr. Strant ? " " I am , ma'am . " He was running his own bluff now . " You killed Nels Antrade . I saw your bullet brand on his hand . " He boosted the bluff . " Antrade was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can produce a witness who saw the Kid in the Gulch  --  like I did myself . "  | Her lower lip curled in under white teeth . " Mr. Strant , I 'll give you two days to leave the Pothole . Remember , I might have friends who would be interested to know a mad coyote of a killer packs the sheriff 's badge . . . . Two days to get out , Mr. Strant . . . . " Garson City was a-howl that night . The free drinks were still being served at John Castro 's expense at the White Horse . Hordes of orey-eyed men roved the streets , shouting and brawling . The dance halls and gambling hells and other whisky mills were in full swing . There were brawls and men left lying in the gutters . A kind of wild frenzy seemed to possess the range town on the Massacre . It was as if it sensed that the lid was due to be blown sky high and was reacting on the basis of make merry for tomorrow blood may run in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolled the latter . He broke up a couple of rows , laid open a saloon tough 's head with his gun barrel , and hustled a couple of the more belligerent breed down to his jailhouse . He himself felt like a blindfolded man treading on the edge of a precipice . His position was n't an enviable one when he summed it up . He had come into the Pothole to find his arrival was awaited and that somebody working under cover was concocting a devil 's broth for him . He 'd  | found that hired gunmen , impersonating him , had been at work to build him a bloody rep that made him a justifiable target for any man 's gun . Finally somebody had plotted to get him in the trap at the Gulch . And now Diane Castro knew who he was . As he paused on the levee bank over the river a moment , he tried to appraise that angle . One thing had struck him . The woman had not threatened to expose him to John Castro . That meant she believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kid himself . She believed Castro had succeeded in hiring the true Kid for his purposes . There was another phase , too . Solo had heard some gossip about how things stood between John Castro and his wife , and he wondered just what the woman had been doing in the Gulch ; she admitted having been there . " Nels Antrade . . . or Barrat ? " he wondered , idly noting the lopsided moon like a big pie with a chunk bitten out of the lower right corner . The Kid started his patrol back along the main road . One thing was terribly clear . He could n't sit in this game much longer playing with marked cards whose faces were hidden from him in the bargain . Not and live , anyway ; he had to grab the initiative pronto . And somehow , running through this whole thing , was a thread , a thread that would  | lead him to the main pattern , especially in the Gulch incident . But he could n't seem to recognize the thread . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orey-eyed railroad worker stumble into it , followed by a wolf-eyed tramp . The latter scuttled off into the debris behind the barroom when he sighted the sheriff , and Strant waited until he saw the laborer find his way into a boarding house around the corner . Coming back along the alley he caught a snatch of talk through the shutters of a side room of the White Horse , recognized Barrat 's rumbling voice . " Yep , Pole . John told it to you right . Smith , the sheriff , claims he spotted the Kid in the Gulch . The Kid who ? " A couple of reeling hairpins went caterwauling past the head of the alley in song and Strant lost the rest . He knew Pole Johnson ; Castro had brought him into the office one day and introduced him . In another moment somebody said something about fresh air ; the shutters were pushed open and the Kid had to get out . It was a couple of hours later in his office when there was a scratch at the back . door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smoking thoughtfully in a far corner of the room , boots drawn off .  | A gun slid into his hand and he eased behind the opened front door before he called to come in . The hinges of the back door rasped and boots creaked in the corridor . " Sheriff ... " Wary of any traps now , the Kid remained silent . " It 's me , Pole Johnson , " the man in the rear said . And the odor of his cigar stub drifted into the office . " Come on in , Johnson . " " All right . But would you mind closing that front door , and maybe shieldin ' the lamp ? This is sorta  --  well , private business . " When he did enter , despite the coolness of the night , globules of sweat studded his forehead as he removed his hat with a gesture of dead weariness . " Squat , Johnson . What can I do for you ? " " Put me under arrest , " said the solemn-faced owner of the Scissors outfit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his flat , narrow body and fetched a pint of whiskey from a hip pocket . When the Kid refused , Johnson took a long gurgle , then drew a folded paper from his pocket and dropped it on the desk . " There 's my confession . I 'll sign it again in front of you , Sheriff , so you can be a legal witness to it . " Strant 's pulses raced . He wondered if this was the  | end of the trail so abruptly , like riding to the sheer , solid wall of a cliff and finding a brush-screened fissure on it . He bestrode a chair opposite the one on the edge of which the keyed-up Johnson lowered himself . " Where do you bury your dead , Johnson ? " the Kid asked with a grin . Johnson nodded heavily . " I would like to kill somebody . But ... " He fastened his eyes on a knothole in a floorboard , speaking mechanically . " I 'm a former horsethief , Sheriff . That was years ago . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana . Escaped . That was twelve years ago . Today , I 'm ready to go back and serve out my term and whatever else they add on . Probably wo n't live it out , but . . . " He thumbed at the confession . " It 's all down there  --  like I told it . " The Kid inspected the coal of his quirly " Why 're you doing this , Pole ? " He suddenly liked the man very much . " I got a daughter , six years old . Her mom died in childbirth , Sheriff . The girl 's been raised by relatives in the East . I 've been writing and made all arrangements for her to stay there till she 's educated . That 'll be some years more , y ' see . I want her to inherit my outfit , all clear and clean . I ? " He half rose , trembling slightly , voice cracking .  | " Sheriff , I 've come to you ' cause I 'm convinced you 're on the square . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to be sure my ranch 'll be here when she comes . And  --  Faith never has to know her father was a horsethief . " There was a commotion out in the road . A gun stung the night twice . The Kid went out . An oreyeyed coot sat in the gutter and triggered at the sky . Strant went out and took his weapons away from him and returned . Johnson stood propped against the heavy desk , head sunken , back to the barred side window of the office . The Kid walked up and down a spell . " Who 's been putting the pressure on you , Pole ? " he finally asked . " Who 's been blackmailing you into more  --  well , criminal acts ? " But Johnson only shook his head . He said he had said all he would ; he wanted to return and serve out his time . To the Kid it was quite plain . He sensed he was close to the core of this thing . The only thing was to slap Johnson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might turn out to be brutal but it would save lives in the end . " Your guns , " he said suddenly . Johnson unbuckled his shell belt and holster and let it drop on the chair . Breath wheezed out of him in a sigh of relief . " ' Tai n't a half bad feeling , " he  | said , shaking his head and putting the stub of cigar , cold now , back in his mouth . The movement of his head revealed the gun spiking between the bars of the window behind him . The Kid 's hand flashed in the deadly cross-arm draw for his hoglegs . They lanced up and he piled lead at the gun muzzle like an evil eye and the segment of hand revealed behind it in the light . The Colt in the window dropped through the bars to the accompaniment of a scream of pain . The gun bumped on the floor . There was a heavier bump . That was Pole Johnson 's long body hitting the floor , too , hitting with the soggy limpness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The gun in the window had said its piece an instant before the Kid 's bullet furrowed the hand behind it .  | He stood up on the hill that was Garson 's Boot Hill with a blanched moon looking down . The black blood of the night was ebbing from the sky 's face slowly . Over to the right the crosses of the burial ground poked out of a faint , low ground mist that might have been a seepage of smoke from hell itself . The note had been slipped under his door , followed by a hurried rap , as he slept fully clothed with his head in his hands on the desk in his office . " Your friend from the Gulch wants to see you up by Boot Hill , " was all the printing on it told , but the Kid had understood . He waited now by the cemetery , but he was thinking of the murder of Pole Johnson right smack in his office . He had rushed out in his bootless feet and down along the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had n't gone any further . It would have been foolish as he realized that the killer could easily have ducked out and joined the throng on the streets in a matter of seconds from another alley . Too , he figured if he could  | get a dying word out of Johnson the latter would now name the man he feared . But Johnson 's face was already waxy-hued when he got back inside . If ? There was a stir in the clump of trees by the side of the trail and a voice said muffledly , " This way . " Strant walked over and the small , slim Jus Lamotte , masked , moved out from cover . " Howdy , " the Kid said . " I got a little matter to thank you for , Lamotte , and ? " He did n't break off because the outlaw leader had spoken . It was that old feeling creeping over him . That warmness when he faced Lamotte . It was embarrassing and , inside , he writhed against it . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and sat down on a boulder . Strant lowered himself to a log , heard the faint click of a gun hammer being eared back nearby ; but he felt no fear around the Lamotte bunch , strangely . " I have a favor to ask in return , " Lamotte said in the small voice , then impatiently pulled off the mask in the dimness . " You have a prisoner in your jailhouse , a man called Luby , Al Luby . " The Kid thought and nodded . Luby was a handover from the regime of the late Levi Raye , charged with rustling from a small outfit down to the south .  | A cowhand had been wounded when he was caught and now lay between life and death . Luby was being held without trial to see if the cowhand died , when the charge would be murder . " I want him released , " Lamotte said . Luby was one of the bunch . Up in the hills , Luby 's wife lay on her deathbed without much time left . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched a spot on his gray trousers , not wishing to look at Lamotte now . It did something to him , somehow made his blood race . " He 'll give me his word to come back in . " " No , " Lamotte said surprisingly . " Once Luby got clear of that jail and saw his wife , he 'd keep traveling . I 'm demanding it of you in payment for saving your hide over at the Gulch . " The Kid jerked erect . He echoed Lamotte 's " no " with a cold one of his own . " I 'm the Law here ! I have no right to betray it  --  not even to square a personal debt of any kind . " He hated to say it . Something mysterious attracted him powerfully to Jus Lamotte . The outlaw leader stood up too . He spoke with a quaver . " Good . That 's what I wanted to hear . You 're on the level , are n't you , Kid ? " " What ? " " Luby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | He swallowed . " You called me Kid . Frisco told you ? " " Did Frisco know ? No , I suspected it when you were at our place in the hills . Then somehow I knew when I saw you in action in the Gulch . You are the Silver Kid . " He laughed lightly with a feeling of relief . It was a strange reflection on the Pothole that the Jus Lamotte outfit was the only thing in it he could trust . He started to take Lamotte by the arm . Lamotte pulled away and sat down again on the boulder . He spoke quickly . " Get out of the Pothole , Solo Strant . This is something too big for even you . The fastest guns in the world are n't any good when a man does n't know who his enemies are . You  --  even you  --  ca n't shoot what you do n't see . " " I ride alone  --  solo , " the Kid said . " Always have . I 've never asked help or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on here . It 's been building for years . It 's evil  --  as evil as anything you could imagine . Even now , without your knowing it , you might be being used as the tool of the men who  --  oh , you 've got to get out , Kid ! " The Kid sat very still , holding his breath unconsciously . When he moved , it was slowly . He unpinned his sheriff 's badge and held it up . " Suppose  | I gave you this and put myself in your hands . . . . " Then he flipped it quickly at Lamotte 's lap . The outlaw leader grabbed clumsily at it in the air , missed . And the badge spun between the trousered legs Lamotte flung apart instead of bringing together instinctively . Strant made a gasping sound . Then he was over and grabbing Lamotte up , roughly but tremblingly . His arms went around Lamotte 's shoulders . The sombrero slid from the outlaw 's head , revealing the soft sheen of the dark red hair parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's . One of the Kid 's hands ran through it . Then he kissed her long and hard , flush on the ripe quivering mouth . At last he had discovered what had drawn him so strangely to the outlaw . They finally stepped apart . " How did you know ? " she finally said with something like a sob in her throat . The Kid held one of her soft arms . " When I threw the badge . . . . It suddenly came to me and I tossed it at you . And you threw your legs apart like a woman accustomed to skirts , to catching a thing that way . A man would have closed his legs . " " Oh . . . I . . . " Then they were together again , the Kid 's arms binding her to him . His temples hammered with the wash of hot blood in them . He  | had never known anything like this before in his life . Then they stood looking at each other , suddenly shy , completely divorced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked her gently . " Marietta Walcutt . I was secretly engaged to Jus Lamotte before he was killed over a year ago . " As they sat down side by side on the log , she stripped off one of her gloves when the Kid took her hand . There was a subdued snort of something akin to disgust from the trees and Frisco Morgan 's squat form moved off . " Jus Lamotte 's dead ? " She nodded . He had been cut down by a stray bullet from a gun ruckus just outside Burtonville where she lived . He 'd been in to see her and had no part in the gunfight . " He died in my arms , " Marietta said very faintly . " And I promised him the bunch would carry on . " Jus had been slight and slim of stature like her , red-headed too ; and he had always worn a mask . So his death had been kept a secret from all but Frisco and a couple of other old-timers . She had taken over the leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the still amazed Kid murmured . Marietta nodded vehemently . Jus Lamotte had  | been no ordinary lobo . His father had been Jean Lamotte , owner of the Anchor-T brand before John Castro had drifted in and bought a section of land from him . And it had been Castro who ruined old Jean Lamotte . Lamotte had been a heavy drinker once but had reformed , but he took to stopping over at Castro 's modest little place more and more often . And one day the elder Lamotte had died in a drunken fall from a horse . At the settling of the estate , John Castro had presented Lamotte 's notes . Castro , by the time he picked up a small mortgage and a tax bill , owned the Anchor-T . It was a sordid story . The girl outlaw shuddered once as she related it under the cold moon . Jean Lamotte 's daughter , a girl in her teens , had vanished . Afterward word drifted back to the Pothole that she had become a disillusioned dance-hall hussy . Justin Lamotte , barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vowing vengeance . " Remember , " she said , " there was nothing that could be proven against John Castro . Nothing .... " Then the boy , Jus , had been charged with theft and forced to hit the out-trails . " They made him an outlaw , so it was the only way he could fight back . " But it had been a crusade , a Robin Hood campaign to protect the little people and stem the power of Castro and the other big cattle barons of  | the Pothole . And to hang the deadwood on John Castro , to gather the evidence that would break him . " In the beginning , he just wanted to kill John Castro , but Castro always keeps himself too well guarded . Twice Jus failed . The second time , badly wounded , he hid out in a swamp for three days . It was months before he could walk again ; then he realized he could n't match Castro 's power face to face . " From then on it had been guerrilla tactics , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She broke off as they heard men coming up the hill . The moon had gone now ; the stars were merely rheumy sockets in the face of the heavens . Ground mist weaved in blurring gently-whipped ribbons over the town . The Kid and Marietta retreated into the trees . A voice came to them faintly . Then two men were heard descending the hill again . The Kid was almost dead certain they were trying to pick up his trail ; he had had the sensation of being followed around Garson , of always being under surveillance of late . They were wondering where he had gone to . " Then Jus . . . And I stepped in and became Jus Lamotte .... " The Kid pressed her frail shoulders , tasting fear  | himself as he thought of the bullet risks this slim girl must have taken . " You 've got to get out , Solo .... " He shook his head , muscles at the jaw hinges twitching . " It is n't only Castro . The others  --  the big men who rule the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuck Barrat . And Johnson  --  though I know he was going straight once . Jus said so . . . . Then there 's ? well , was  --  Nels Antrade , and Ring Anderson . They 've all got gun spreads . They ? " His face was blank as a plank but behind the drowsy-lidded eyes cold flame smoked . " I 've been outnumbered before , Marietta . " Her fingers bit into his forearm . " You 've got no proof of anything . Nothing to show ? " " Bullets do n't ask questions  --  at least , not when I trigger ' ern . " Rage like a piece of stone sat heavy in his chest , and that weight would not be gone until he swung into action . " You might get one  --  even two . But the others , with their bunches , they 'd come for you . And you 'd be branded a murderer , Solo . Remember , you 're already iron-marked as a killer and renegade in the Pothole now . . . . Witnesses by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " The Kid 's teeth snapped on . his audible quickcaught  | breath He began to see what she was driving at . " You 've got to restore the legend of the Kid , Solo . You 've got to clear your own name . . . . And if you want to clean up Garson and the Pothole , you 've got to expose  --  not merely kill  --  the men who 've brewed this devil 's broth . And there 's no way of doing either  --  yet . " They stood silent for a long time , Strant with a quirly in his mouth that he lit once and then let die . The horizon yellowed in the east . The Kid was trying to put things together . If Antrade had lived a spell after being fatally shot in the Gulch .. . if Pole Johnson had breathed a few more breaths with which to push out words as he lay on the office floor ... He probed and searched and clawed in his mind for that thread . She stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I could help you  --  if I with Jus 's bunch could  --  but ? " There was no need to say the rest . Anybody associated with the Jus Lamotte outfit would be earmarked an outlaw ; as she had told him , Castro had blamed his killings and depredation on the Lamotte band always . The name of Lamotte was blacker in the Pothole than sin spooned out of hell 's bottom . She put on her sombrero with a certain grimness.  | The time had come for them to part . And forever . " Solo , leave . Clear out , my dear . We both understand men have been posing as you  --  and earning you a rep to put your neck in a noose . They ? " The Kid laughed low but harshly . " I never got my boots round-heeled yet from side-stepping trouble , Marietta . " Her mouth trembled . " Would you leave if I came with you , Solo ? " Half a minute later , his answer came , grating from a tortured throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She half twisted and seized his shirt in her long hands . " You 've got to get out , you fool ! Do n't you see ? Leave ! Go somewhere else . Be seen there ? and stay there . Be seen by scores of witnesses , say , just somewhere outside the Pothole . Then when the next killing is done here by whoever is posing as you  --  you 'll have the answer . They 'll be exposed as impostors . At least people will know the real Kid never went bad . See ? See ? It might even expose the machinations of this ring here and ? " Then he was laughing , lazily , with a hint of ice beneath the chuckle . As would an hombre who at last sees how to cut the trail sign of the men he hunts . If he held this bogus Kid , he held the key ... .  | Riding back down the hill into Garson , there was a bitter-sweet pain in his heart . For the first time in his career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . More than just a beautiful face ; a woman who commanded his admiration because she could stand on her own feet , alone . " A woman of fire and steel , that Marietta , " he murmured into the wind . If she had been the kind who wept , she would have shed tears as he held her before riding back . For to her , it was the last time . " When this is done , we 'll go out of here and get married , " he had told her . " I  --  well  --  I 've got a nice piece of dinero tucked away . We 'll get an outfit of our own and settle down and ? " But she had shaken her head sadly ; she knew it could never be . " I 'll be close  --  watching you in Garson , Solo , " she said as he mounted . That worried him some . The showdown was crowding , and he was ready to call , to demand the payoff on the pot . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taste of her lips on his mouth . Then he wrenched his disciplined mind around to the problem confronting him . The threads were beginning to knit inside his head . A vague tracery of the pattern outlined itself . He was ready to gamble dobie dollars against gold that Castro was his man , at least one he wanted . Still he had no concrete evidence , and as Marietta had pointed out , these men had to be exposed before the country . But Castro had been definitely surprised about the sham Kid appearing in the Gulch , surprised in the manner of a man who felt he should know the whereabouts of this sham Kid . And it had been John Castro 's bunch , Marietta had told him , who had raided the hideout in Superstition Hills after the night when Levi Raye had been murdered at Sadie 's place . Adding that up , it meant Castro had slain the former sheriff . " John Castro , not knowing I was the Kid himself . . . " Solo muttered . Then he swung onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stained the dirty gray of the dawn . He rode down to the hotel of Barrat 's . His mouth curled before he dismounted . There was blood on so many hands of the rulers of the Pothole . Barrat , now , half owner and segundo  | of the big Bearpaw . But , as Marietta had told him , his partner-owner had disappeared from Carson some years back , never to be seen again . The story was he had gone to St. Louis . It was a ten to one shot that that partner lay rotting now in some hidden unmarked grave in the Pothole . Bustard shoved up his hat a half-inch and squinted from a chair on the porch , said nothing . Then John Castro with Taber at his side rode around the corner . Castro 's right am was bandaged up and in a sling . He stated cursing at sight of the sheriff . There had been an attempt to hold him up last night out on the trail as he rode home . His right arm was all smashed up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By Gawd , Smith , if you do n't do something soon ? " " Shut up , you wind-bellied mosshorn , " Strant flung back , and smiled coldly at Castro 's outraged look . " It was n't the Kid  --  because I 've got him . " The effect was sharper than a gunshot . Down the road batwing barroom doors creaked as the swamper threw out a bucket of mop water . Bustard rose and came to the railing of the hotel porch . Castro sat the saddle as if he 'd been turned to stone . Then he shook his head . " No ... no . Maybe you think you 've got the ? " He broke that off . " Let 's  | go down to the jailhouse and take a look at the ? " " He is n't there , " Strant informed him . " Well , where then ? " The Kid gave the dry facts as he lazily built a smoke . He had captured his man on a tip , but he had done it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't able to talk yet . I got him hid out till he 's able to ; I do n't want any lynch mob grabbing him . " Castro 's features betrayed nothing . But he was almost as gray as the frock coat slung over his small shoulders . " Take me to him ! " It was an order . Solo Strant shook his head . " I 'm the Law ; I 'll rod this show , Castro . " There was a silent duel of a full minute 's duration . Then Castro laughed harshly . " You have n't got him , Smith ! It 's a bluff ! " The Kid 's hand opened . In it lay the little glittering silver skull . It was the convincer . Castro knew that was part of the rig of Brothers , the second man he had hired to impersonate the Kid . Then Castro was leaning from the saddle , patting the real Kid 's back . " By grab , that 's the deadwood ! You 've got him , Smith ! You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His eyes smiled and he swaggered confidently as he dropped down and went up the steps .  | When the Kid rode back to the sheriff 's office , doubt hung in his mind . He could n't understand Castro , and wondered if he was wrong about the man . Unnoticed , Bustard swung a leg over the end railing of the hotel porch , dropped into the alley , and was gone . He knew where his boss , Tuck Barrat , was sitting in at that all night game ... . When John Castro walked into his suite on the second floor , Diane was seated in a chair by the window . " What the devil 's this  --  a death watch ? " he asked sneeringly . Then he realized she was fully dressed , and had not been to bed . For once he could look at her coldly , without desire . Things were well in the world for John Castro . The information of Sheriff Smith did n't upset him in the least . From one of his many sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the Pothole , had been seen down south of the Pothole at Sour Creek Junction , according to the word . He had found the Pothole too danged hot for him , Castro figured . As for Brothers , if Smith had grabbed him . . . Well , that did n't bother him either . His information protected him again . One of the last times he ' had talked with Brothers , on his liquor the latter had admitted he had been regarded as insane after  | having been kicked in the head by a horse when a younker . He 'd said , too , that sometimes even now he had spells , as he called them . That would be Castro 's answer if this Smith did get the captured Brothers to talk . Brothers was crazy . After all , Brothers had no concrete evidence to prove how he had been hired . He looked at Diane again , noticed she had some sewing on her lap . That was unusual . Normally she was so busy preening herself she had time for but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But those days were over . " Where were you all night , John ? " she said icily . Then her mask broke and she screamed : " Do n't lie to me ! I know ! I know ! You were up in the Old Town at that Walker 's pig-sty and ? " " Lie ? Why , of course I was there  --  with a girl called Rosetta . Part Mex ; she 's going to be my next wife . " " What ? " Fear clouded Diane 's cold , blue eyes for once . " You  --  why , you 're drunk ; I 'll never give you a divorce ! I 'll never never ? " Castro tossed his sombrero on the table . " Please do n't scream ; I 'm not deaf . I 'm giving the orders now . I 'm finished with you . You have no more hold over me  --  not since I 've met Rosetta . . . . " He spread his legs and hooked his hands in his vest . It  | was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few thousand when you get out . That 'll give you a fresh start in a honky tonk  --  where I picked you up . " She laughed , and not wildly , but jeeringly . " You poor fool . You poor benighted clown . You ca n't get rid of me . The Anchor-T is mine , mine , do you understand ? You 've got it in your will  --  you leave everything , everything to me ! You fool , why do you think I got you to write your will that day we were married ? I 'm staying and ? " Castro slowly poured a drink with a steady hand and rubbed his jaw . " Need a shave . . . . Listen , Diane . It says in the will ? to my wife . ' And ? " She had half risen , holding the sewing against her thigh . " Listen , John Castro . You might as well know it now . Who I am , I mean . No ! Listen ! I 'm holding the whip now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henders ' was my mother 's family name . My real name was Diane Lamotte .. . daughter of the man from whom you stole the Anchor-T ! Now do you understand ? " Castro gasped in surprise , then shrugged . " All right . " She swayed , actually showing by her face that she wondered if he were insane . " Listen . Do you understand ? That 's why I grabbed you when you came along  --  to get the Anchor-T back . Why I 've  | flayed you and driven you to make it bigger and bigger  --  and richer  --  to make yourself boss of the Pothole ! Because everything  --  all of it  --  would be mine again some day . " She leaned on the chair arm . " And you expect me to walk out ? " Castro sipped his drink and looked a little weary of the whole thing . " You listen . That will reads , To my wife . ' " " Yes ? Well ? " " You are n't my wife . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Justice of the Peace was a friend of mine , a gambler down on his luck . We were never married . . . . I do n't know why I did it that way , except I 've always had a trick of keeping an extra ace up my sleeve . . . . So you better leave peaceably , Diane , if you want a red cent . " She stood very still , all color deserting her tempting face . Castro wondered if she was going to faint ; then she brought one hand out from under her sewing . That hand held a tiny pearl-handled doublebarreled derringer . She shot at him twice ; the second bullet hit him in the head . Castro went down as if he had been clubbed , eyes closing at once . He fell across the table , slid to one end , dragging the cloth with his body . Then he was prone on the rose pattern of the carpet , the gore  | from his head coating the whole back of his skull and giving a sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if half his brains had been blown out . She 'd never thought a derringer could do that . She only thought a split second , if what she did could be called thinking . Now nobody would ever find out about the mock marriage ; but a man as big as John Castro could n't be killed without trouble . Even a woman might be hanged for his killing . Castro was too big to be allowed to die quietly . He was too important . Those things penetrated the fog in her brain . Then she grabbed up a cloak and ran out the door and down the hall . Diane Lamotte had made a life business of using men . She was going to use Tuck Barrat now , and also use the knowledge she had about Sheriff Smith , so called . That man , the Silver Kid as she knew , would pay for spurning her . And all Garson would spit at mere mention of the name of John Castro who had double-crossed the whole country . Nobody would give a hoot about who killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well done . She would tell Tuck Barrat that the sheriff was the real Kid . That her late husband , John Castro , had hired him , double-crossing his own partners . Then all Garson City would be on the march ... .  | Down in the sheriff 's office as the eye-searing , flesh-frying sun climbed up into the morning sky , Solo Strant went through the tortures of the damned . He was just recalling how Marietta had deliberately shot down Monk 's wounded brother back in the bunch 's hideout , how she had cut him down as he fled blindly to the secret escape outlet from the headquarters . It twisted his entrails and bludgeoned his heart . He himself hated killing , shooting to hand a man a ticket to Boot Hill only when it had to be that way . And this woman of his had killed . There was the other side of it , of course . She had taken over the grim , risky role of leader of an outlaw band to carry on the work of her dead fiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barons of the Pothole . Still Then , out through the doorway , he saw John Castro and Taber , his shadow , coming down through the weaving heat devils of the sunshot street . There was something about the way they approached , like men in a hurry yet trying to maintain  | the appearance of not hurrying . Of not fleeing , Strant realized suddenly . And , like an audible accompaniment to their coming , was the dull rumbling sound from somewhere behind . It was like a muffled roar yet somehow animalistic , the not too distant hunt cry of the wolf pack . Next Castro came up the office steps on the open run , shedding all pretense . " Kid , they 're coming for you , " Castro said . He had always realized his sheriff was as much a poker face as he himself was . The Kid 's tongue whipped across his lips once , though , that time . Castro gloated inwardly ; he was too smart for all of them . After seeing that spitting derringer in Diane 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him holding the dripping empty wash basin pitcher . The bullet that had hit him had merely torn flesh , hitting a blood vessel and producing a spurt of blood when it knocked him unconscious . Taber had fed him a drink and gotten him into a chair , then told him what was happening . The lid was off in Garson . Quietly but swiftly , the treacherous Barrat was spreading the word that Castro had double-crossed everybody ; that Castro had placed the kill-mad Silver Kid , who had gone bad as everybody knew , in  | the sheriff 's office , and that this hombre called Sheriff Smith was the Kid himself . " I saw Di  --  Mrs. Castro with Tuck , " Billy Taber concluded his story . " Things 'll be- " But Castro had lifted a hand to silence him . Very quietly he had sat with a towel clamped to his bleeding head , figuring it out , adding it up . He had n't gotten as far as he had by any chunkhead moves . And it came to him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that skull he had just showed before  --  that was his own ! Castro had n't let his brains stampede . The sheriff 's tale of having captured the Kid , Brothers , was either a bluff or a mistake . Brothers was supposed to have met him down the river two days ago and had n't appeared . Therefore he was n't in these parts . That was that . " My Gawd , boss ? " Taber started . Again Castro had lifted a hand , and after another couple of minutes he had the answer . Sure , his sheriff was the true Kid  --  as he , John Castro , had known all along . That was why he had put him in office , to clean up things and hunt down this bogus Kid . That was all ; very simple , because he was a square honest man who wanted to see Garson and the Pothole cleaned up . That 's what he would face them with .  | He got up , took another drink , and was steady . With Taber , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man to round up his secret hired gunslingers in the town . He also gave him instructions to get word to his ranch hands secretly stationed up in the Old Town . Now John Castro stood inside the door of the sheriff 's office . He smiled with the flick of his eyes , gesturing with his bandaged arm in the sling . " Yes , Smith  --  or should I say , Solo Strant  --  I always knew you were the Silver Kid himself . That 's why I was so gol-darned eager to hire you , Kid . You were the man to do the job , I knew . " Spread-legged , on guard , the Kid stood behind the desk , switching his glance to Billy Taber an instant . " Yes ? " " This so-called Kid who 's terrorizing the country , I knew he was n't you , Strant . Your kind do n't change their spots overnight . " Though he gave no sign , the Kid was dumbfounded . " You said they 're coming for me ? Who ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuck Barrat , " Castro explained . " I should 've known what a snake he is ! He 's around town , spreading the word that you 're the Kid , the Kid who 's gone kill-locoed in the Pothole , and ? "  | He never finished . A tide , a human tide , blackened the road up the slope to the center of the town , suddenly . They came like a slow-lapping but inexorable flood wave , packed from side to side of the street . Men 's bodies bumped the building fronts as they moved . In sullen menacing silence , far more of a threat than a wild shrieking mob , they moved on the sheriff 's office . Dust like the drag from a huge herd wafted lazily above them . Castro 's nerve was superb . Anyway , any second , his bunch would come swinging in from the Old Town , and he held the aces , all the aces . When the sun set on this day , he would be master of the Pothole . Tuck Barrat would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranging a meeting with Brothers and silencing him forever . Castro stepped out upon the small stoop of the sheriff 's office , and his very effrontery , plus the aura of his power and reputation , stopped them in their tracks . " Friends , " he started . He would tell them that of course the sheriff was the Kid , as he had always known . Just as he knew this rampaging killer was a bogus Kid , and then he said no more . Weakness from that head wound , a passing but paralyzing nausea , clamped hold of his body . Things blurred before his vision , he swayed slightly and Taber steadied him at his side .  | John Castro never finished that speech . If somebody had swung up a gun , it might n't have happened , but a silently thrown rock from back in the crowd arched up in the blinding sunlight . It smote Castro over the ear and he pitched backward . Taber caught him with his good arm . Then Taber had shot and a beardless button in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belly . It was so fast nobody had seen it . Nobody had seen Taber 's good , unwithered arm go for his gun . That arm had been supporting Castro . The blood was spilled . A great ear-ripping cry rose and quavered and exploded into a vengeance roar from the throng . The front of it huddled around the fatally wounded younker , but the die had been cast . The Kid himself dragged the limp Castro back inside and hesitated at the door . Before he could open his mouth , half a dozen pieces of lead slapped into its wooden frame . He slammed it and got ready . A flat voice spoke from the hallway behind the office . " You can never hold ' em off here , Kid . This roof is wood and 'll burn . " It was Frisco Morgan . " Get back into the jail block . " The Kid knew he was right . It was a case of getting out the rear and into the jail , a dobie blockhouse  | of a place , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or parleying . Castro came out of his daze even as they started out the back . The Kid had a doomed feeling . Old Cal was just opening up the double doors of the jailhouse when the windows of the sheriff 's office shattered as if the place had been exploded . Yells of frustration spat upon the day . Then a handful of men spewed from the rear door of the office . The Kid , deadly cool , turned and sent four bullets ripping over their heads , another past the corner of the little building where more men flowed out of the alley there . All flung back , cursing . The Kid entered the jailhouse and the heavy wooden doors were barred behind him . " First time I ever walked into one of these shebangs without benefit of a badge-packer and a gun prodding my back , " Frisco said . " Let 's hope we walk out , " the Kid said , eyeing Castro . He still could hardly believe what he now knew , that Castro was innocent ; but facts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kid got busy arranging things . It might be a prolonged siege , holding the square chunk of twostoried building against that horde would be a job . Upstairs he hastily superintended the shifting of  | the three prisoners to a rear cell . The other cell doors were left open so they could get to any window quickly . " My men 'll be in here soon . Everything 'll be all right , " said Castro , sitting on a bench in the upstairs corridor . What he did n't know was that Diane had already ridden up into the Old Town and sent his ranch gun-slingers home , saying it was on orders from him . The words were hardly out of his mouth before the first rush came . They simply swarmed across the jail-yard . Short-gun and rifle fire greeted them ; then somebody in the rear passed an order and they drew back past the sheriff 's office and to the jammed road . The Kid had a single glimpe of Barrat 's huge frame . Half an hour passed with no action as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from a barred window . " That 's Big Joe out there across the road from the railroad ... a powder man , Kid . They 're going to dynamite the place , and then ? " He pointed again . A heavy wagon , horseless , was being rolled into position beside the jailhouse . Its purpose was clear . " Cut loose with your guns and kill enough of ' em to cool ' em off ! " Castro yelled hoarsely . " We ai n't got any extra ammunition to begin  | with , " the Kid said , ordering everybody to hold their fire . " And I do n't want innocent if misled men murdered . We ? " Above the mutter of the mob a gun began to bark down one of the sidepaths leading off the street . Heads turned that way and the throng swayed like a current across the road , puzzled . Old Cal called that somebody was pounding on the back door of the jailhouse . The Kid ran down the stairs and stood ready with eared-back gun hammers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the Jus Lamotte bunch , ran with three of her band behind her . She caught herself just before she flung herself into the Kid 's arms . He wanted to curse ; he did n't want her there . It was one of the bunch creating that diversion down the side-path across the road . She and the three men had come through the grove of trees behind the jail building . The mob had posted some guards there to be ready to warn them of an attempted flight . They had been jumped from behind and knocked out . He came to an instantaneous decision then with her there . Their hours were numbered unless something was done . " I 'm going out to them , " the Kid announced casually . " By giving myself up they 'll have to believe I 'm innocent . They 'll have to listen  | to my story . Please , Marietta , do n't ? " He was already heading for the heavy front doors , dragging her as she wordlessly clung to his arm . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the iron-grilled window beside the door . A horseman had shoved up through the avenging pack . He dropped off and began to walk slowly but with grim intent right toward the jailhouse . As he neared they saw it was Ring Anderson . His shirt hung in tatters over his chest , revealing the blood-stained strip of bandaging around one shoulder . His hat was gone and his hair was wild . Around his heavy mustache his face was chalk-hued . Once he stumbled , twisting so that malformed shoulder blade projecting from his back was revealed . The Kid jumped over and pulled open one of the jail doors a few inches . Ring Anderson almost collapsed through it but straightened as his eyes focused on the Kid . " Sheriff , " he croaked in a voice like a tired echo , " I tried to tell ' em but nobody would believe me . I 've got the Kid . " His head wobbled and his legs slid sideward under him . They got him propped on a box and Frisco produced some redeye . Ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a stricken man .  | " The Kid  --  that fake Kid  --  Brothers is the handle he 's been using of late  --  he is my brother . " He hurried out his story in that tired shriveled up voice . His brother , Tod Anderson . He 'd always been locoed since being kicked by that horse as a youth . He would be all right until he got excited ; then he wanted to kill . He had shot up a few people in the past , and they tried to keep him hidden at the ranch each time when he came back . " But this last time , he got to thinking he was a killer before he disappeared . Then ? " Anderson moaned at the thought . " Then he went riding around as the Kid . Doing all  --  all them things . Last night he came home again . He actually thought he was the Kid . I 'd had all I could stand . " Ring had made a prisoner of his brother , being shot in the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is he ? Why did n't you bring him in here with you ? " Marietta cried frantically . " Why ? " The Kid dropped a hand on her shoulder , stilling her . He knew the signs . Anderson 's face had flushed up and he had clapped a gaunt hand over one side of his chest . A heart attack ; he did n't have long . " He is my brother , " Anderson got out finally . " I did n't want him clawed apart and tortured by some  | lynch-crazy pack . I thought if I could turn him over to the Law on the quiet and ... " " Where is he ? " the Kid asked calmly . " Down in a shack on the Flat . " Frisco explained that hurriedly as Anderson jerked up and then the bottle slid to the floor with a crash from his fingers . One of his eyes closed and he smiled wearily . He was slipping out fast . The Flat was a mud strip outside the river levee where the down-and-outers lived when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him ? " Anderson said painfully . " He never meant no harm . He ? " He said no more . And that was the answer . Tod Anderson , Brothers , the bogus Kid , had to be brought in.  | It was the only answer . The Kid realized it at once , and planned quickly . He and Frisco and one of the Lamotte bunch would make the try . Marietta wanted to go , too , but he refused . Then the three of them were slipping out , bellying into the grove where Barrat thought his guards were still stationed . They used the ponies of the bunch . Somebody from a rear second-story window sighted them and screamed the alarm ; when they cut over into the side street leading up to the Old Town , a pack was already rounding the corner from behind , some of them mounted . They turned into one of the numerous alleys leading down to the river front and the third man dropped off at the corner and began to throw lead back down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's order . They got to the levee and pounded along in its gloomy dank lee . Frisco located the shack on the Flat . When they pushed in the broken-down door , an insane cackle greeted them . Brothers , garbed in  | the black rig with the fancy silver trimmings as the Silver Kid , sat bound in a corner . His mind had cracked completely . They cut him free and led him out like a child and put him in the saddle of the third horse . He chattered childishly in a senseless gibberish , docile and pitiful . They headed back for the main road . A fresh roaring broke out and then was swallowed in heavy gunfire . They were rushing the jailhouse to move up the wagon with the dynamite charges and blow a breach in the wall . The Kid thought of Marietta . Solo Strant went almost crazy then . Grabbing the bridle of the idiot 's pony , he rode the spur steel . They pounded down the slope toward the sheriff 's office . Men turned and hastily triggered wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun-slick , jumped down from a porch . The Kid put two slugs in his chest and dropped another charging man with a blow of his gun barrel . And then the gunfire broke off . They had seen the idiot prisoner in the rig of the Silver Kid , between the real Kid and Frisco . The word ran like wildfire . This , to that mob , was living proof that the sheriff was not the Kid . At a walk , Solo led the way down to the office as an alley opened amongst them . There was yelling and the  | word was passed to those up near the jailhouse . They came shoving and stampeding toward the road to see . The Kid halted and held up his hands . " I am the Kid , " he declared briefly . " And this " ? he indicated poor Brothers ? " is the man , the half-witted killer , who has been impersonating me ! " He waved them aside and dropped from the saddle to take the prisoner into the office . Huge-bodied Barrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened , and he had to make his all-or-nothing gamble swiftly then . " He lies ! " he thundered in that rumble of voice , and went for a gun . It was sharp and brutal and short . Barrat was firing from the doorway . The Kid had already triggered  --  but his gun hammer snapped on empty shells . Then his other arm lanced across his body and came up in the cross-arm draw . A chunk of lead drilled his hat crown , and then Barrat was swinging back like a gross body on a pivot , his right gun arm busted . He dug for a second weapon in the clothes enveloping his vast body . Twice more the Kid 's weapon crackled , and Barrat sank onto his pants from his knees , legs pushed out awkwardly . Both of them had been broken under him . His second gun had fallen . " I give up ! " he cackled , shrill with terror now . " I  | give ? " His hand came out of a vest pocket where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only clutched a thousand-dollar bill . " I give up ! I 'll tell everything .... " The witless Brothers crouched handcuffed in a corner of the office , not even aware of what was going on . While a sawbones worked over Barrat , the latter 's tongue wagged a mile a minute , the whole sordid brutal story of the Pothole pouring out . The mob , now jubilant , milled triumphantly in front of the office . A few of the town leaders had control . The weary Kid , face smoke-smudged , went out the back door toward the jail . Frisco came around a corner , half his face a red mask of wet blood . The Kid choked ; after all , Frisco did bear his bullet brand and Frisco snorted , waving a bottle , then sleeved his face to show that the blood came from a bullet slice in the skin . He nodded at the Kid . " I meant to tell you sometime , Solo . You did n't put the sign on me out at Solomon 's Oasis that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut my dewclaw on some old barbed wire in the grass slipping up to that door . " The Kid chuckled with relief . That had been haunting him . " Shucks , Frisco . The job 's done  | now . Now you can go out to Frisco where that girl of yours is and ? " " Are you locoed ? " Frisco snapped , lifting the bottle . " That gal went out there with the no-good drygoods drummer she married . " He waved toward the jailhouse . " You got some unfinished business . " Down there , Marietta stood in the doorway , waiting the signal from him . He began to run and she advanced toward him . Behind her appeared Castro and Billy Taber , his shadow . Taber stomped out into the yard , cursing at blood on the sleeve of his right arm . He had stopped lead in that last rush on the jail . " To think that Castro is innocent , " the Kid was thinking . " Well , we did it , Kid , " Castro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm sling swinging loose . Then he froze , realizing . The Kid was rooted in his tracks too , for in the melee of the last hour , John Castro 's arm bandage had become unwound . It revealed his shotup arm that was n't shot up at all . It revealed the Kid 's bullet brand high up on Castro 's hand . The bullet brand put there a split second after John Castro had killed Pole Johnson through the window of the sheriff 's office last night . All the wily Castro 's plans had been undone by  | that one act , for Johnson had not been going to talk . It was the one unnecessary , stupid killing done by the boss of murder in the Pothole . The Kid 's hands drifted in a blur of speed for his holsters . Castro went for his guns , his eyes flickering over to Taber at one side . The Kid 's eyes jumped there too . But Taber 's good arm dangled uselessly . The Kid 's hands glided up , gun-filled . " Solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kid and Taber . The Kid 's guns snarled and Castro twisted drunkenly on a smashed leg . And his shots were echoed by the slap of Taber 's hogleg . It had been drawn with his supposedly withered arm . It was Taber 's ace in the hole , what made him a king among top gunhands , the fact that people did n't believe he could draw with that arm . The bullet never reached the Kid . He saw Marietta rock backward , then sink . His guns chanted an unholy chorus as they slammed lead into Taber 's carcass , killing him before he went over backward . Two slugs burned by Solo 's right ear . He whipped about to see Castro firing from the ground like a snake . The Kid ran at him and let him have it from ten feet . That bullet parted John Castro 's hair and the brains beneath it . Castro hoisted halfway up , and grinned foolishly . Then his face went into the earth and he never felt it .  | When the raging Kid got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive . He cupped the dark red hair in an unsteady hand . Her arms reached up and clasped around him . " We cleaned up the Pot  --  hole ... did n't we , Solo ? " He could n't speak . He only nodded , seeing the tiny but mortal bullet hole in her shirt . Her arms tightened around his neck ; then they gave a spasmodic twitch and fell away . When he rose he walked like a condemned man whose joints are already stiffened by the face of his nearing doom . A man came hustling out of the back door of the jailhouse . " Hey , that Diane Castro was just seen riding outa the Old Town with Casey Robbins , the gambler . We could catch ' em and ? " The haggard-eyed Kid only shook his head wearily . " She lost , too ; got poisoned by the dirty vicious plague that was eating the Pothole . The plague 's over now , I hope . It took another woman to scourge it . " And he bent and lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
