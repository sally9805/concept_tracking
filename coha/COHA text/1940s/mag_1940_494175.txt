Winter Book Number John D : An Academy Portrait ' TRADE could not be managed by those who do manage it , " Dr. Johnson said comfortably , " if it presented much difficulty . " Still , provided that you do n't stop to quarrel about the adjective , it is easy to demonstrate that Mr. Rockefeller was a great man . Draw up two lists of prominent Americans ? one of men who lived before the Civil War , the other , of men active after the Civil War . You will find that your first list is made up of men en ? gaged in politics , your second of men engaged in business . In the second list , the name of Rockefeller stands easily first , easily ahead of such names as Morgan , Carnegie , Vanderbilt , Hill , Pullman , Huntington and the rest . Ex ? cept for Cleveland ( and in another era Wilson ) , what men of politics were , of the stature of these business men ? Not Fish ; not Hay ; and certainly none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elihu Root . Many things explain the difference between the two lists ; but the broadest explanation is perhaps that before the Civil War the most exciting thing that talent could do on this continent was to govern the people , while after the Civil War it was to exploit the resources of the conti ? nent . The characteristic of our own time ? post-e932 -- - is perhaps that the wheel has swung full circle . A few years ago the President was reported as saying to Mr. Grace of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation , " No one will ever make a million dollars a year again in America . " Beginning in 1933 , we saw the young graduates of the law schools pour not into the downtown law factories but into the govern ? ment bureaus . Some years , ago Jim Wadsworth and Ham ? ilton Fish were the only St. Mark 's boys in the Congress : today politics is striated with the colors of the old school ties . Partly , this is due to the coming of bigness , the divorce of ownership from management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " young executives " stratum . Everybody ( so to say ) works for something im measurably higher than any individual : the biggest and now the least hampered of these work-providing anonymities is government : talent will go increasingly into government as government moves increasingly toward the supervision and even direction of the uses to which , the labor and savings of the nation shall be put . No world could be farther from resurrectibility than Mr. Rockefeller 's . Standard Oil in Mr. Rockefeller 's day was in many ways the prototype of great American enterprise . It was by no incorporated . means our firsti company ; it was not even the first attempt at monopoly ; but its founder was very likely the first American enterpriser to carry over into the do ? main of big business the Puritan 's horror of waste and detestation of gambling ? which waste and gambling were paradoxically the chief traits of nineteenth-century Amer ? ica . Another Standard Oil quality , again reflecting its head , 1John D. Rockefeller , by Allan Nevins . New York : Charles Scribner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remoteness from shortsighted greed . Mr. Rockefeller could discriminate between the pennies to be clutched and those not to be clutched . His product was the best : this i monopolist always produced as if he had competitors . He never failed to distinguish between the economies that could be effected by superior management and the false savings that brought losses through stoppage of production , desertion by underpaid officials , rejection by the market of inferior goods . Mr. Nevins tells us that his wage policies were always generous , and that is very likely . Unlike the farm-boys and horse-traders who ran great American en ? terprise seventy years ago , he encouraged his department heads to train others to work while they " sat down , cocked up their heels , and thought out some way for the Standard Oil to make money . " Mr. Nevins does not say so , but from a remark dropped by Flagler in this book I am ready to believe that the Standard Oil people had much to do with the invention of that most baffling and fascinating depart- ment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were among the reasons for its strength . Most business men of Mr. Rockefeller 's time were lucky , luckier even than they were greedy , wasteful and ruthless . Europe was sending us gratis a flow of immigrants whom it had brought to maturity of muscle , if not always of mind , at immense expense to itself . They had to be fed , clothed , sheltered , which is to say , they constituted a ready market as well as labor power . Every raw material needful to them was here , virtually free for the enterpriser 's taking . A man had to be a blubbering idiot not to make money in America after the Civil War : he had to be crazy or an habitual gambler to lose it . Most of Mr. Rockefeller 's con ? temporaries in business were gamblers ; a great many were fools ; and of both Mr. Rockefeller took the fullest advan ? tage . All , meanwhile , were handicapped as against him by the fact of being men : they had desires , weaknesses , pas ? sions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculating machine ? or as Mr. Nevins calls him , a man with the intellect of a chess player . " I have never had a craving for anything , " Mr. Rockefeller said once ; and this ghastly declaration , which Christ would have been too humble , Socrates too wise , and Calvin not arrogant enough to utter , seems to have been true . Except an irascible tem ? per , to which he himself refers but of which Mr. Nevins gives no example , the great man had no weakness : there was nothing in this being that demanded self-discipline . In his quiet , secret , self-deprecatory way he was perhaps the most remarkable subject for psychological scrutiny ever thrown up on this continent . Mr. Nevins , who is no psychologist , deals with his hero from the outside . He shows that he grew up in the skirts of the mother he so much resembled in temperament and ap ? pearance ; that as a child he bought candy by the pound and sold it to his family by the piece ; that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a neighbor $5c1 at seven percent , thus discovering the self-generative power of capital ; that his father ( " a master of business precept , " 796 says Mr. Nevins admiringly ) taught his son the tricks and dodges of business by a method which the teacher himself ? a cancer quack and money lender ? explained in these words : " I cheat my boys every time I get the chance . I want to make ' em sharp . I trade with my boys and skin ' cm and I just beat ' em every time I can . I want to make ' em sharp . " ( For those who like the story of the Jew who stepped aside as his child jumped from a height in order to teach the child to trust not even his father , the training of Rockefeller pare will seem uncommonly . Hebraic . ) Mr. Nevins shows his hero mature at every point before his . , twentieth year , already a donor to charity , and at twenty one a trustee of his church . Less importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's religion than in my view it merits . It had quite other effects than merely to offer " this unemotional youth an outlet " and instruct him in charity . This peculiar Chris ? tianity , which is concerned with the here and not the here ? after , which is respectful of conduct and indifferent to the notion of an immortal soul , which confuses the conception of sin ( essentially self-defilement ) with a cautious regard for the criminal code ( injury to others , not to self ) , ex ? plains a great deal of Mr. Rockefeller 's career , no less than character . Mr. Rockefeller once told a Bible class that a customer had threatened to leave his commission firm unless Mr. Rockefeller advanced funds to him before the presen ? tation of the bills of lading covering the goods against which the money was to be loaned . Our hero refused ; the cus ? tomer " flared up angrily , " but he continued to do business with Clark and Rockefeller . " I have ever since believed , " Mr. Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to do what we stated we did not do , as a test . " This , I have no doubt , was profoundly Mr. Rockefeller 's notion of temptation to sin ; it was his idea of the essence of Christianity . His solemn conviction that what he practised was religion , and not merely business ethics , his belief that the purely temporal precepts by which he lived constituted eternal spiritual doctrine , had the immense significance of persuading him that all his acts were , if not inspired by God , at any rate approved by God . Mr. Nevins says that he never failed in anything : it is more significant that he never believed himself wrong in anything ( and I do not mean merely acknowledged himself wrong , for I am per ? suaded that he was not a hypocrite ) . Thus , of his part in the scandalous South Improvement Company he said in later years : " I had our plan clearly in mind . It was right . I knew it as a matter of conscience . It was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved above all to be fair to a man long and often maligned , is led by this sort of thing into the paths of pointlessness and illogic . In the instance of the South company he absolves his hero by a remarkable ex ? ample of the ignoratio elenchi : since Mr. Rockefeller dis ? cussed the scheme fully in letters to his wife , Mr. Nevins concludes that " this goes far to prove that he was con- . vmced he was following a proper course , for Mrs. Rocke feller was a highly religious woman with stern moral standards . " But as Mr. Rockefeller himself was , by Mr. Nevins ' showing , highly religious and sternly moral , the appeal to his wife 's standards is certainly supererogatory . Further , Mr. Rockefeller 's conviction is not at issue : the question is whether he did or did not participate in the THE NEW REPUBLIC wrong-doing which the author imputes to his associates . ( This question Mr. Nevins answers by making his hero guilty of a " great error " of judgment in aligning himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Finally , the letters displaying the innocence of heart in which Mr. Rockefeller " kept her fully informed " are not reproduced ; though space is taken for his expressions of self-justification . The story which Mr. Nevins has to tell is in the main sor ? did and not , as one might , think the tale of a great accom ? plishment should be , exhilarating , or tragic . The individual producers of crude petroleum were as shortsighted and greedy as gold prospectors , and were besides , dependent for their success upon the transport companies . The independent refiners were greedy , too . As the required investment m refining was small , and the prices paid , by the public were high ( Mr. Nevins is vague about the consumer aspect ) , there was always big money to be made in the industry . The railroads struggled for the oil traffic ruinously until Mr. Rockefeller showed them how to settle their differ ? ences ; but in such a way that when the roads had helped him to put his competitors out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found themselves his victims , since he could swing a tremendous volume of traffic from road to road . They had , therefore , to recoup themselves , as to millions of dollars annually , by excessive rates on other goods . The classic Standard Oil schemes were ( r ) to get a lower shipping rate than rivals paid , and to get in addition , in cash from the roads , the difference between the two rates paid by the competitors ; ( 2 ) to choke off crude supplies from competitors ; ( 3 ) to force the transport com ? panies to deny the competing refiners access to markets ; ( 4 ) to work the fifth-column game by bribing servants of rival companies , putting their own people into those com ? panies , or secretly buying up a competitor and obtaining the trade secrets of rival groups through the officials of the company secretly acquired . This is , of course , far from the whole story . The other side of the picture involves the general position of the economy and the technological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove in ? dustrial combines into being ? and the superior gifts of the Standard Oil management . But though Mr. Nevins makes a great deal of the fact that vision and efficiency yielded the Standard Oil crowd great profits , he nowhere attrib ? utes any important part of those profits to the more repre ? hensible methods by which Standard Oil obtained its monopoly ; and his attitude to Mr. Rockefeller reminds one of the story of Jake Shubert protesting indignantly " What ! / should use Shubert methods ? " Mr. Rockefeller was never ruthless , to say nothing of anything mane un ? pleasant ? " just very acquisitive , " says his biographer . The truth is , Mr. Nevins possesses no point of vied ' except the resolve to be fair , and no acquaintance witn political economy such as would permit him to make on t , the case for industrial combines in general , and Standard Oil in particular , which can legitimately be made . pos ? sessing no affirmative philosophy , he is unable to dominate his subject , but writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocent of economics , he is IT : able to relate the general to the particular , except by ' 41 reiteration of moral judgments which are of no value . He ' . loyal to his materials , and much more scrupulous in setting DECEMBER 9 , 1940 forth each separate instance of unfair practice than he need have been ; but what he gives with his right hand he takes away with his left , for as only separate instances are examined , as the method of " on-the-one-hand and on ? the-other-hand " is employed , he never gets anywhere . He does not deal with his subject in respect of the economy as a whole , or discuss the public interest except as one large abstraction or another is brought out in the records of pub ? lic hearings which form part of the source material he was bound to examine . He is so little a political scientist that he strikes a parallel between the acts of an individual and the acts of a sovereign government , comparing , on the grounds of propriety , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financial practice that he praises Mr. Rockefeller as one who never watered his stock ? quite Ignoring the fact that stocks are watered to be sold to the public , whereas up to the time of Mr. Rockefeller 's retire ? ment , the stock of Standard Oil was owned exclusively by its founders and their partners or heirs . Every reader of this work must feel that Mr. Nevins is throughout on the defensive , determined to be fair , not to let his temperamentally liberal bias appear . It is this which , in my view , has led him into the vain moralizing and the excessive concern with detail which mar what might have been a reasonably complete and detached history of an important phenomenon . Only an economic historian could defend the defensible aspect of the Standard Oil combine : for a good part of the task which he set himself Mr. Nevins , the political historian , was not adequately equipped .
