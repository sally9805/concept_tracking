txt A China relief program of some $510,000,000 soon will go to Con. gress for approval . At the moment , the National Advisory Council is studying State Department recommendations on the , subiect . For some weeks , the State Department has been on record as preparing such a program for China . For months it has been under pressure , primarily from prominent leaders of the Republi ? can Party , to give American aid to China as well as to Europe . Yesterday , Secretary of State George C. Marshall disclosed that the Administration 's plans were in the hands of the NAC . The Administration is committed to presenting some Chinese aid program to Congress . The program it has drawn up , however , is a relief measure , in contrast to the European aid program , which is a recovery project . Thus the proposed half-a-billion-dollar China program is not expected to do more than keep South China frc . n deteriorating into economic and political chaos  --  and there is no assurance it can do that . The European aid program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of $6,800,000,000 , is basically a recovery program  --  though , there again , recovery is not Iguaranteed automatically . Closely Related The China relief program will go to Congress only after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ends its weeks of hearings on the European aid program . The two programs , nonetheless , are bound to be associated and discussed jointly , for in many aspects they are closely related . The China relief program would provide the Chinese Government with commodities it most urgently needs  --  such as wheat , cotton , petroleum products , rice , coarse graMs , tobacco , etc . These items , however , are the very ones which are in short supply for the European Recovery Program . It is well recognized by the Adminisfration that any China-aid plan necessarily will add to the demands being put on American resources and production . The question is whether such added requirements could seriously threaten either the domestic ) economy or the European pro . gram . It is evident that in presenting a $510,000,000 program , the Administration 's experts believe it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China include Senator Styles Bridges ( R ) of New Hampshire , who recently wrote a sharp note to the State Department charging the Administration with running out on China 's Central Government and putting American " good faith " ' in question ; Gov . Thomas E. Dewey of New York , who in one of his rare stands on international issues urged aid to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ; and Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan , who for months has been critical of what he terms the Administration 's " do-nothing " China policy . , The advocates of aid to China argue that American foreign policy is pulling at cross purposes when it supports opponents of Communism in Europe but fails to help the enemies of Communism in the Far East . They assert it is logical to help Greece fight Communist - led rebellion but hesitate to help the Chinese Central Government in its struggle against the Communists in the north . Critics of aid to China include both those who argue that the Chinese Communists are not real Communists but only agrarian socialists and those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiang Government reforms itself . China Reforms Urged To date , the Administration has hung back from helping General Chiang unless the Central Government instituted major economic and political reforms . Irk. formed sources in the Capital anticipate that if any China relief measure passes Congress , efforts will be renewed to get Nanking to adopt certain reforms . Even with such reforms , however , the aid program , as envisaged here , can be only a holding operation , an interim relief measure designed to keep China from slipping furthers into chaos and anarchy . Without such reforms , half a billion dollars would be money down the drain . There are some signs that the Chinese Government is contemplating certain changes being privately urged by Washington  --  economic reforms to stem inflation and step up production , political reforms to break the Kuomintang 's undemocratic dominance .

Chinese mission is here in Washington discussing China 's problems with American authorities and outlining measures the Chinese Govern ? ment is undertaking .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
