" The underwriting community wilted and reeled , " reported the sympathetic New York Herald Tribune in telling how Federal Loan Administrator Jesse Jones last week offered to bid for public utility bond issues . " Investment bankers . . . saw the RFC as a potential competitor who could fix terms and rates , and put them entirely out of business . " <P> On second thought , Jesse 's plan struck Wall Street as much less alarming . What he had really offered was to backstop SEC with RFC cash if the former gets into trouble enforcing its new competitive bidding rule . Issues involving $100,000,000 or more may prove too big for competing syndicates to tackle , and that is where RFC will step into the picture . Right now there is a case in point : Columbia Gas &; Electric 's $120,000,000 issue , for which not even Halsey , Stuart has been able to get together a syndicate . <P> Ex-SEC Chairman Jerome Frank got the backstop idea while he was complimenting Jones on his tough handling of the Arkansas State issue he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a profit . He asked Jones if he would similarly make a market in big utility deals , and last week Jones made public his promise to compete for any big issues which bankers seemed to be negotiating for on their own terms . Subsequently he will accept piecemeal bids from bankers or market the bonds direct to insurance and trust companies . In that event , probably more gilt-edged flotations would go to smaller institutions outside of New York than heretofore . In the rush of stock offerings sure to result from holding company dissolutions Jones may also help by lending investment houses money to bid .
