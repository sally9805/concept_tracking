The Russians and the Germans , in these July days of 1942 , are fighting the battle that may decide the world 's fate . <P> On the plains beside the Don the battle has only begun . Already it is erupting and spreading along the vast Russian front . No Russian loss or retreat in any one sector will be a final loss . But if the Germans win this battle-and in the Don sector they were still winning this week-the war will be indefinitely lengthened ; the 1939-42 phase of it will be definitely lost . The U.S. and Great Britain , invading Hitler 's Europe and fighting him on his own fronts , will then have an infinitely harder task than Hitler had in Russia . And it will be a task that they must take on while in the Far East Japan is still winning , and growing stronger , and becoming as hard to defeat in her area of conquest as Hitler will be in his-if Russia falls . <P> The Time is Now . Moscow knows this , and Moscow 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same : that the U.S. and Great Britain must open a second front in Europe , and open it soon . Not only the tone , but the words were different ; and the differences reflected the mounting urgency of Russia 's need and peril . <P> Now was no time for the diplomatic niceties and strategic reticences which blunted the first announcements after Molotov visited Eden and Roosevelt ( TIME , June 22 ) . Last week Moscow 's spokesmen did what none had done before : they said flatly that the U.S. and Great Britain had decided " to open a second front in Europe in 1942 . " Commissars in the field with the Red Army quoted this unqualified declaration to the troops-and Moscow let its allies know that the Red Army had heard of the promise . Russia in her hour of peril had given the promise of hope to her troops , of warning to London and Washington , that there could be no turning back . <P> Cried a Moscow broadcaster , significantly speaking in English : " Time waits for no man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole year , a year in which Britain was able to accumulate her forces and the U.S. to develop further their industries and build their Army and multiply their Air Forces . Now time will not wait while the peoples of Europe are waiting , * and waiting impatiently , for aid and for the signal to act . . . . " <P> Fear for the First . Some London and Washington correspondents last week warned the United Nations not to expect a second front very soon . These dispatches may have been no better than many a bad guess from those capitals . But they were no comfort to Moscow . Perhaps the U.S. and Britain were not yet ready , but many a non-Russian who remembered Spain felt that the only unforgivable and irreparable failure would be the failure to try .
