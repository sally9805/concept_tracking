The biggest merger in U.S. aviation history last week got off to a fast start . Not a minnow , but a pickerel of an industry began to swallow a whale . Vultee Aircraft , Inc. announced that it would buy the 440,000 shares of Consolidated Aircraft Corp . common stock now held or controlled by Consolidated 's president , Major Reuben Fleet ( TIME , Nov. 17 ) . The price : $10,945,000 , equal to $24.88 a share and less than 50 below the stock 's alltime high . After formal contract signing in Consolidated 's huge San Diego plant , Vultee 's President Richard W. Millar , Rube Fleet and an army of lawyers toasted the deal with Coca-Colas in paper cups . Thus Vultee took control of Consolidated through a 34% stock interest , and Rube Fleet will be U.S. big-bomber-builder No. 1 no more . <P> <P> Vultee has a $178,000,000 backlog and 9,000 employes ; it rang up a $593,000 loss in the six months ended last May . Consolidated 's 30,000 employes are busy on a $725,000,000 backlog ; it earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal makes sense aplenty to Fleet , Vultee , and the Army &; Navy . <P> To Major Fleet , 54 , the deal is his best chance to swap his huge holdings for hard cash , thus pave the way to diversified investments and an easier life . Trying to sell his shares , Fleet started dickering with <P> Wall Street brokers a year ago , never got what he thought a decent offer . Vultee 's bid was made more tempting to him by two side dishes : 1 ) he will stay in Con-solidated-Vultee as an adviser at $60,000 annually for five years ; * 2 ) by selling now he dodges the much higher capital gains taxes likely for 1942 . <P> Equally satisfied are Army &; Navy-not merely because Vultee is in but above all because Rube Fleet is out . Although Fleet 's production record surprised them and his whopper planes are the champs of their class , he has long been persona non grata in Washington . Too often his sharp tongue has raked the Administration and accused it of bungling the defense program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rube Fleet 's San Diego office feeling his prices were more than a little high . <P> Vultee is a smart little production outfit that has developed some new assembly-line techniques ( see cut ) hut it has made only single-engine planes ( Stinson trainers , Vanguard pursuits , Vengeance dive-bombers , etc . ) . For it , the Consolidated deal is a side door to the big-plane field , which it otherwise would have had to spend millions in plant and experimentation to approach . <P> Vultee and Consolidated engineers spent weeks roaming through each other 's plants , finally decided that-working as one-combined production could be increased , efficiency greatly improved . <P> But last week none of these was so pleased as stocky , razor-brained Victor Emmanuel , 42 , president of Aviation Corp . which owns 71% of Vultee common stock . The many subsidiaries of Emmanuel 's AVCO already make aircraft engines and propellers ; it has big investment in New York Shipbuilding , American Airlines , Pan American Airways ; soon AVCO will control Consolidated as well . So that little    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
