LUCKY FORWARD ( 424 pp. ) - Robert S. Allen-Vanguard ( $5 ) . <P> <P> George Patton , able General and chronic martinet , stood on the steps of a medieval English manor and sounded off to his staff : " ... I mean business when I fight . I do n't fight for fun and I wo n't tolerate anyone on my Staff who does . . . . Ahead of you lies battle . ... It is inevitable for men to be killed and wounded in battle . But there is no reason why such losses should be increased because of the incompetence and carelessness of some stupid son-of-a-bitch . I do n't tolerate such men on my Staff . " <P> Neither incompetent nor careless , and by no means stupid , Robert Sharon Allen of Pearson &; Allen 's Washington Merry-Go-Round was Patton 's G-2 operations executive ( i.e. , military intelligence officer ) in the ETO campaigns . He came home minus his right arm , sporting a rash of ribbons and a Patton commendation for " superior performance . " No shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the jacket of Lucky Forward , his raucous , truculent history of Patton 's Third Army . In a not very roundabout way , the author is made to shine in the reflection of Patton 's glories , for , according to Allen , " Patton never made a move without first consulting G2 . In planning , G-2 always had the first say . " <P> George the " Greatest . " Were George Patton alive , he would surely relish what Allen has to say in Lucky Forward : 1 ) " . ... Patton was the greatest battle commander produced in this country since the Civil War " ; 2 ) Patton would have ended the European war months sooner had not SHAEF stymied the Third Army every time it got rolling ; 3 ) had Patton 's plans not been upset by higher headquarters , the Germans could never have mounted their Ardennes campaign ; 4 ) many of the Third Army 's great victories were won only because Patton , sometimes with General Omar Bradley 's help , attacked when SHAEF wanted him to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some surprise that hard-riding General Patton was " a hero to his men " and that he was generally called " Georgie . " To most combat men , he was " Patton , " their general and a good one , but they were seldom taken in by the publicity Patton courted . Most line troops resented his flashy , self-designed uniforms , sardonically muttered " our blood and his guts , " when they heard his pre-battle exhortations . No Third Army infantryman could have written such stuff- &-nonsense; as this : " An attack might appear suicidal , but if ' Georgie ' ordered it , it was accepted as a sound and tenable mission . " <P> Former foot soldiers , who regarded even a regimental headquarters as a soft spot , may also find it hard to understand Allen when he writes : " Tailors and bootmakers in neighboring towns were deluged with rush orders for smart battle jackets and combat boots . . . high-geared action , hard-hitting competence , and breezy cockiness became HQ Third Army 's fixed character and tempo . It moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard . "
