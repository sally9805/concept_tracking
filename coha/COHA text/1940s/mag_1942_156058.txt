The first cellular growth of the new U.S. Army was complete before Pearl Harbor . More than 1,700,000 men were under arms , had been parceled out to tactical divisions , behind-the-lines outfits , housekeeping commands . Last week the cells were in division ; the Army was off on another multiplication process . Lieut . General Lesley James McNair announced that he would form 32 more fighting divisions during 1942 . General McNair 's word was " activation " - military lingo for the birth of a new outfit in all the complex panoply of modern weapons , modern organization . He announced that three new divisions would be activated in March , two in May , three in June and four on the 15th of every month thereafter in 1942 . <P> This is a big operation . Even under the war-spurred processes of 1942 , a division is in gestation for three months before it is born , must be trained 10-12 months more before it can call itself a military adult , ready to take the field . <P> Some of the new divisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The process begins when the new division commander ( a major general ) , his assistant and his artillery officer ( both brigadiers ) are selected . In the next week they must comb over the names of officers they know only from their records , to pick the general staff . <P> The staff goes off to school for four weeks ; some officers to The Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth ; some ( artillery , signal corps , engineer , quartermaster and medical ) to specialized branch schools . <P> Thirty-eight days before activation , the C.O. and his staff arrive at the camp where the division is to be trained . There they get acquainted , lay plans . Six days later the other top officers , along with 72 seasoned noncoms from trained regiments , pull in . More noncoms-1,118 corporals and sergeants-report a day later . Finally the outfit gets its junior officers-439 lieutenants from Officer Candidate Schools and officer pools . <P> Last growth is the biggest : the 624 officers and 1,190 noncoms are joined by 13,435 privates . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers . Their uniforms do n't fit , they look like Puss in Boots in their leggings . <P> But when the last bewildered rookie rolls off the train with his lumpy duffel bag , the division is born . Under the barking of the noncoms it grows from infancy to gangling , slack-kneed adolescence . It marches , shoots , gets wet in the field , straightens its legs , grows hard and smart . If its officers and noncoms are on the job , it finally grows up ; its rookies become soldiers in less than a year . And each new division knows that many of the outfits on Bataan Peninsula had no longer a time to grow before they had to prove that they had come to man 's estate .
