Sorrowful Jones ( Paramount ) , a remake of Damon Runyon 's Little Miss Marker , turns out to be a major salvage operation . The original 1934 Hollywood version lifted Shirley Temple to stardom . The current version , though it has very little to do with Runyon , lifts Comedian Bob Hope out of an accumulated litter of silly scripts , props and costumes , and gives him a new grip on the U.S. public 's funny bone . <P> As a penny-pinching Broadway bookie , Hope has only two props to work with , but both of them get worked to a fare-thee-well . One is a forward little moppet ( Mary Jane Saunders ) whom Hope accepts as an I.O.U . on a racing bet and later adopts as a permanent but irresistible liability . The other is a horse called Dreamy Joe . When Mary Jane needs a nightie , Hope flings her a sodden , outsized sweatshirt ; when she is sleepy , he sings her a lullaby improvised from a handy racing sheet . When she lies desperately ill in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blocked by a frantic nurse , he puts a confidential finger to his lips . " It 's my brother , " he whispers . " Thinks he 's a horse . Sshh ! " <P> The three scripters who rewrote the original screenplay have turned out an almost unbroken series of gags and gambits . For every ounce of Runyon 's boozy Broadway sentiment they have added a pound of farce . Hope , past master of the triple-quip and the doubletake , tosses off this mixture with obvious relish . Little Mary Jane , though no Shirley Temple , shows pretty talent as a straight man . Hope 's other helpers , including Lucille Ball and William Demarest , provide sturdy filler for an already meaty comedy . <P> Neptune 's Daughter ( M-G-M ) , starring Esther Williams , is a musical that is brilliantly Technicolored , lavishly staged and gowned , blatantly expensive and extravagantly dull . Esther Williams is widely publicized as an amphibian attraction , * and her special gifts are apparent when she is photographed in a swim suit or in a pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in street dress , well away from the water . As a result , large chunks of it seem somewhat pointless . <P> Especially pointless is the sluggish little romance between Esther , a former swimming champion who has become a manufacturer of beach wear , and Ricardo Montalban , a South American polo player . Their love story produces only one good piece of entertainment : a lively little song called Baby , It 's Cold Outside , which is already well established as a jukebox hit . Between the long , arid stretches of talk , Betty Garrett and Red Skelton supply some shorter sketches of acceptable slapstick . The rest of the show , including a razzle-dazzle water ballet at the end , lumbers along like an overdressed float in a Mardi Gras parade . <P> <P> *Just as widely , in fact , as Annette Kellerman , who pioneered the one-piece bathing suit and starred in a 1914 movie also entitled Neptune 's Daughter .
