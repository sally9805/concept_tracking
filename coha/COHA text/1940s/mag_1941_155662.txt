Hissing for pianissimos like a music-loving gander , the goateed , salt- &-peppery; conductor waved the orchestra into Delius ' placid The Walk to the Paradise Garden . Suddenly Sir Thomas Beecham heard a sound that was not in the score . <P> Sir Thomas does not like to hear sounds that are not in the score . This one was the click of a camera shutter , from News Photographer Arthur French , who was in the front row . Sir Thomas whirled in fury , brandishing his baton , shouted : " Leave the hall . This is an insult to the audience . You 're sorry ? Well , you should be . Leave the hall at once . " Photographer French left with all speed . <P> The Seattle Symphony and the audience were much impressed . They were also impressed by the fact that the rich , gouty , opinionated , convivial conductor is one of the world 's half-dozen best , and by his uninhibited performance : his hisses and shouted " Hos " ( for loud passages ) , his spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fainting-in-coils method of conducting . <P> Before the week was out , Sir Thomas was photographed in even more annoying circumstances : receiving a writ from a process server . By way of the Seattle sheriff 's office , His Majesty 's Government notified Sir Thomas of its claim that he owed some $5,000 in back income taxes . The heir to Beecham 's pills ( " Worth a Guinea a Box " ) pleaded ignorance of the claim , cabled his solicitors to pay the claim , if just , or fight it , if not .
