Once again the fox was in flight . For three weeks , while General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery cautiously poked at him , Erwin Rommel had crouched in the bottleneck of El Aghila , holed up . Montgomery had been in no hurry to attack . He had had to bring up supplies across the 700 miles of desert which Rommel had already covered in his retreat from El Alamein . Until he was ready , he had kept Rommel in a state of nervousness with jabs of armored cars and tanks . First clue to his readiness came last week . Heavy artillery began to bellow from behind the British lines . Over the Axis position rolled a cloud of some 300 Allied planes . Infantry advanced . British tanks struck at the inland end of the Axis lines . British forces surged against the northern end . Rommel made scarcely a pretense of holding . He was up and off in retreat . <P> It seemed clear that he had never hoped to hold . Apparently his shattered Afrika Korps , filled out with odds &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German High Command , whose primary objective was to hang on to Tunis and Bizerte and strike back in northwestern Africa . The fox had been left to find another temporary refuge , possibly at Misurata , 300 miles farther along the North African coast . After Misurata was Tripoli , itself a dubious refuge , target of methodical Allied bombing . <P> It was too early to tell what relation Montgomery 's advance bore to Lieut . General Dwight David Eisenhower 's campaign in the west . It might have been designed to relieve Eisenhower by forcing the Germans to divide their strength between Tunisia and Tripolitania . <P> Stuck . All week Lieut . General Kenneth A. N. Anderson 's First Army had been stuck in the mud . The cold and fog of a North African December hung over Tunisia and torrential rains made quagmires of the few roads that threaded the mountains . The Allies were still trying to move supplies up , still trying to equip advanced airdromes as fighter bases . <P> Anderson 's advance columns , fingering in toward the Axis strongholds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced back . German tanks harried them . German paratroops leap-frogged behind their extended positions trying to disrupt their communication lines . The Luftwaffe dominated the grey , dripping skies . There were disquieting reports that the Axis , pouring in airborne reinforcements from Italy , had gained numerical superiority along the fighting front . On the heights overlooking Mateur and Madjez-el Bab , Anderson 's lightly armed advanced troops grimly hung on and waited for heavier troops to crawl up . <P> News was fragmentary . Allied headquarters in North Africa had little to say beyond a laconic : " There is nothing to report . Bad weather has stopped all operations . " <P> Unstuck ? Then at week 's end came brighter reports . Heavy and medium U.S. bombers unleashed two days of concentrated raiding on the docks of Tunis . The waterfront of that seaport was left in flames over a distance of ten blocks . Allied fighter operations were suddenly on the increase . P-38s ( see p. 83 ) made a sweep across Tunisia 's waist to attack Axis concentrations near Sfax . One dispatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spitfires took off 30 minutes later to challenge the Luftwaffe .
