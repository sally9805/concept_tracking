To the Negro press , all things black are good . Racial papers studiously ignore Negro failings , shout their indignation over real and fancied injustice , assail color discrimination so hard that they help to keep it alive . <P> When LIFE 'S editors , last February , decided to publish a close-up of Negro Champion Joe Louis , they looked about for a Negro journalist to write it . The man they picked was dimple-cheeked Earl Brown , 38-year-old , Virginia-born managing editor of Harlem 's weekly Amsterdam News . <P> Earl Brown belonged to a new school of Negro newsmen . A Harvard graduate ( 1924 ) who won his letter pitching on the varsity baseball team , onetime instructor of economics at Louisville Municipal College in Kentucky , Editor Brown believed in honest news reporting , telling the truth about Negroes for their own benefit . <P> To Detroit , where Negro Idol Joe Louis got his start , went Earl Brown , on leave from the Amsterdam News . There he talked with Manager John Roxborough and his wife , with some two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening with Marva Louis , Joe 's wife , while she told her troubles . Back in Harlem , he saw Al Monroe , onetime Louis pal , Negro staffwriter for the Chicago Defender . Then Editor Brown wrote his story . <P> Consensus of the opinions of these Louis intimates : " Joe is a big , likable kid , but not too bright , " spendthrift , sleepy , easygoing as an Alabama field hand . Marva Louis told how nonsmoking , nondrinking Joe frittered away fabulous sums of money on cab fares and cabaret checks for his friends . Trainer Jack Blackburn admitted that Joe did n't care much , one way or the other , about fighting . From newspapers and court files Earl Brown traced Manager Roxborough 's connections with the numbers racket , Manager Julian Black 's impressive police record . Some of the more lurid facts about the Louis entourage were generously omitted from the story . <P> When LIFE 'S close-up first appeared , one week last month , reactions among Negroes were generally friendly . Out of 16 letters in Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Rufus E. Clement of Atlanta University , North Carolina 's Sportswriter Dave Hawkins ) praised Author Brown for a good job . Said Joe Louis , according to a friend in Detroit : " I ai n't read it yet . If he makes something out of it , let him make it . I make mine fighting . " <P> Then hell popped loose in the Negro press . Publisher Robert L. Vann led off with a thundering attack on Editor Brown in his Pittsburgh Courier . Manager Roxborough told an interviewer : " Earl Brown has proved himself just another Uncle Tom who . . . would sell the Negroes of America down the river . ... " <P> One afternoon Amsterdam News 's Publisher C. B. Powell called Editor Brown into his office , told him that Roxborough did not like the story , feared it might hurt Joe Louis ' status as an idol . Said Powell : " Do you want to resign or be fired ? " Earl Brown chose to be fired .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
