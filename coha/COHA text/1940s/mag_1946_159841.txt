FANFARE FOR ELIZABETH ( 227 pp - Edifh Slfwell-Macmillan ( $2.50 ) <P> Henry VIII believed that his new bride , Anne Boleyn , was comparable to the finest products of the royal orchards- " a wife with a strawberry breath , cherry lips , apricot cheeks , and a soft velvet head like a melicotton peach . " But old Farmer Brocke insisted that the new Queen was actually the daughter of Old Nick , as was proved by the fact that she had a mole shaped like a strawberry on her white neck , and sometimes touched it with her left hand-on which grew a rudimentary sixth finger . Farmer Brocke believed that King Henry had married a witch , and one rainy day he grumbled to Mistress Higons : " It is ' long of the King that this weather is so troublous and unstable , and I wene that we shall never have better weather whiles the King reigneth , and therefore it makes no matter if he were knocked or patted on the head . " <P> This treasonable grouch caused poor Farmer Brocke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the royal executioner . But his view was shared by thousands of Englishmen-affected equally by medieval superstition and horror over Henry 's conflict with the Pope . Crowds screamed maniacally when the new Queen appeared in public . The very heavens were said to be outraged by the royal sacrilege ; the night sky was rent by speeding , flaming symbols of doom , and tongues of lightning came down to earth to meet the blaze of the fires in which the Catholic martyrs were consumed . <P> " Bell , Book and Candle . " Henry VIII stood firm by day , danced the night through with his witch . When the Pope cursed him " with bell , book and candle , " and at last excommunicated him , Henry replied that " if the Pope issued ten thousand excommunications , he would not care a straw . " Henry exulted because his new Queen was pregnant , and the best necromancers , astrologers and wizards all agreed that the portents indicated an heir to the throne . When , instead , a puling female appeared , Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth that he had defied the Pope , divorced his first wife , and even sacrificed to his witch the longest and most comfortable bed in the palace ? <P> Fanfare for Elizabeth is just what the title says ( but may not suggest ) . It is a study not of the reign of the great Queen but of the terrible turmoil and trumpeting that ushered in her birth , childhood and adolescence-years when the lives of privy councilors , dukes , queens , princesses , butchers and bakers hung upon a royal mood , a rash word , or a murderous plot concocted behind velvet curtains .
