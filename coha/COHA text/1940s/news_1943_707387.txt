txt After District Attorney Frank S. Hogan had unexpectedly rested his case without any attempt at direct proof that Thomas A. Aurelio had been aware of the criminal past or underworld associations of Frank Costello , the former Magistrate took the stand in his own defense yesterday at the disbarment proceedings under way before Official Referee Charles B. Sears at the county court house . Recounting his efforts to enlist the help of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and many other persons in his campaign to obtain the Democratic nomination for a place on the Supreme Court bench , Mr. Aurelio testified that he had accepted the help proffered by Costello . He conceded that a few days before the judicial convention met Costello assured him that the nomination was " in the bag " for him . Mr. Aurelio , a meek-mannered , puffy-cheeked individual with a mild voice , was on the verge of offering his version of the telephone call in which he is alleged to have pledged his " undying loyalty " to Costello when the hearing was adjourned until this morning . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unsuccessful attempts to deprive Mr. Aurelio of the Democratic and Republican nominations for the Supreme Court . Costello Credited With Power Before closing his case so abruptly , Mr. Hogan did bring out from Abraham Rosenthal , Mr. Aurelio 's Tammany district leader and close friend , that he knew that Costello was the operator of slot machines in Louisiana , where they were permitted under the law , during the period in which he frequently was consulting Costello about the progress of Mr. Aurelio 's drive for the Supreme Court nomination . The prosecutor also brought out from the cherubic little district leader many interesting indications of the power wielded by Costello within Tammany Hall . Mr. Rosenthal conceded that Costello helped Michael J. Kennedy to become the leader of Tammany . He also told of consulting Costello , in preference to Mr. Kennedy , for information about coming moves within the party , and for approval of a prospective patronage appointment . The only other witness called yesterday by Mr. Hogan was Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine , who testified to Costello 's bad reputation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place in evidence a sheaf of newspaper clippings about Costello 's activities from 1925 to 1939 , but Referee Sears reserved decision on whether he would ac cept them . Before the hearing was opened to the press and the public yester- , day morning Costello was permit-i ted to testify in camera , in order to give him a chance to name the many highly reputable friends he said he had , without subjecting them to embarrassing notoriety . This took only a few minutes . Mrs. Aurelio Testifies Mrs. Aida L. Aurelio , wife of the accused former magistrate and coleader with Mr. Rosenthal of the Eighth Assembly District , briefly preceded her husband on the stand , where she testified that he was an excellent husband and father . Mr. Hogan forced her to admit that she " might have " told reporters she had never heard of Costello . She previously had testified on direct examination that she and her husband had been guests at Costello 's home once . Mr. Rosenthal , a stocky , baldish man , whose outward eagerness to please Mr. Hogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had testified before the grand jury , was in the witness box almost all morning . He testified that he was a lawyer , admitted to the bar about thirty-five years ago , and that since June , 1941 , he has been Democratic leader of the Eighth Assembly District . He testified that he first met Costello at a gathering of district leaders soon after former Representative Christopher D. Sullivan left the leadership of Tammany , in February , 1942 . He explained that several groups were forming among the leaders during the discussion of a successor to Mr. Sullivan . At a meeting of one of these groups , he said , he was introduced to Costello by Dr. Paul F. Sarubbi , leader of the First Assembly District . " Did you know Costello 's business at that time ? " Mr. Hogan asked . " I did not , " Mr. Rosenthal replied . " Did you find it out shortly thereafter ? " Mr. Hogan said . " I believe in the latter part of 1942 or early in 1943 , " Mr. Rosenthal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogan brought out the minutes of the grand jury and forced Mr. Rosenthal to admit that he had actually learned Costello 's business within a few days after their first meeting . Mr. Rosenthal said that Costello told him that he operated the Louisiana Mint Company , which operated a gambling device that was legal in Louisiana . " He said that it was legal and that he derived a substantial income from it , " Mr. Rosenthal said . He added , as if to show the impression his new friend had made on him as a substantial businessman , that Costello had told him that he had a tax proceeding involving $600,000 pending . Mr. Rosenthal said that he first met Costello and Magistrate Aurelio together at a beefsteak party of Jimmy Kelly 's organization in Webster Hall last February . He said that he saw the two men talking together , but did n't hear their conversation . Tells of Meeting With Kennedy Mr. Rosenthal testified that he told Mr. Kennedy he thought he had in Magistrate Aurelio the bestqualified candidate for a place on the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrate to his office in the General Motors Building one day last March . Mr. Kennedy , Bert Stand , secretary of the Tammany executive committee ; Dr. Sarubbi , Costello and Clarence Neal , leader of the Twentieth Assembly District , were present when he and Magistrate Aurelio arrived , Mr. Rosenthal testified . He said that Mr. Kennedy told him he was considering Mr. Aurelio and several other candidates . " Congressman Kennedy said ' I 'd like to talk to the judge alone for a few minutes ' and they both walked out of the room , " Mr. Rosenthal testified . " In a few minutes Dr. Sarubbi walked out of the room . Within another few minutes Clarence Neal left the room , and then Mr. Costello did so . " Mr. Rosenthal told of being entertained at Copacabana , a night club , by Costello , along with Magistrate Aurelio , and of having overheard Costello promise Magistrate Aurelio " that he would get the Italian organizations and would do everything he could for him . " He said that Magistrate Aurelio told him later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had helped other candidates . The district leader said that he had not known Costello was interested in Magistrate Aurelio 's advancement until the meeting in March . He said that after Costello entertained him in his own home , " I got to realize that he was very close to Congressman Kennedy . " Mr. Rosenthal admitted that he had promised Magistrate Aurelio he would ask Mr. Kennedy about the truth of the rumors that other candidates were in the field , but that he did not actually do so , contenting himself with asking Costello . Says Costello Had Advance News Under Mr. Hogan 's questioning , Mr. Rosenthal also admitted that Costello had told him that George Thompson , who was a Tammany district leader at the time , was to be " eliminated . " He said Costello also told him that Isidor Greenberg , another leader , was not to be recognized at the coming judicial convention . " So he was giving you , a district leader , news ? " Mr. Hogan asked . Mr. Rosenthal smilingly admitted that that was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hogan asked whether Mr. Rosenthal recalled the issuance of the District Attorney 's statement on Aug. 28 making public the telephone conversation between Magistrate Aurelio and Costello . " I 'll never forget it , " the district leader replied with such obvious sincerity that laughter filled the court room . He said that on the preceding night he had received a telephone call from Mr. Aurelio , Who told him that Mr. Kennedy had informed him that District Attorney Hogan had tapped Costello 's telephone wire and that Mr. Hogan had told Mr. Kennedy that , unless Mr. Aurelio declined the Supreme Court nomination , he was going to publish the conversation . " He Magistrate Aurelio told me that he said to Congressman Kennedy : ' Why should I decline ? What have I done ? ' " Mr. Rosenthal said . Mr. Rosenthal testified that he and Magistrate Aurelio met Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Stand at Mr. Kennedy 's office at 11 o'clock the next morning . " Congressman Kennedy said that he thought it might be better if he did decline , " Mr. Rosenthal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Hogan inquired . " Not to any extent , " was the reply . Valentine Tells About Costello Sol Gelb , chief assistant district attorney , conducted the questioning of Commissioner Valentine , who said that Costello was known to the Police Department as a bootlegger and a slot-machine-operator who at one time had as his slot machine territory " everything below Fifty-ninth Street . " He said that Costello 's reputation was " very bad . " Former State Senator Thomas I. Sheridan , counsel for Mr. Aurelio , brought out that the amendment to the criminal code permitting the police to tap the telephone of notorious characters became law in May , 1942 , and that the actual tapping of Costello 's wire did not start until May 7 , 1943 . He demanded whether Mr. Valentine could name a single criminal act of Costello 's in recent years . The witness admitted he could not . Mr. Sheridan elicited from the Police Commissioner an admission that he had written a letter apologizing for a statement he had made at a conference of commanding officers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands of ' Scotch whisky , " House of Lords " and " King 's Ransom . " While Mr. Valentine was reading the letter the air raid sirens howled and the hearing was hastily interrupted . After Mr. Gelb had offered the photostats of the newspaper clippings about Costello , the prosecution rested . Wife Defends Aurelio Mrs. Aurelio , a handsome woman with creamy complexion and dark hair , looking younger than the 37 years she gave as her age , was the first witness for the defense . She wore a brown pillbox hat , gold earrings and a tan coat with a beige fur collar over a dark-brown dress . She said that she studied journalism at Columbia University for a year and a half before embarking on a secretarial career which lasted for several years . She married Mr. Aurelio twelve years ago , she said , and they have two children , a daughter , 9 , and a son , 7 . Testifying to the evening in March when , as had already been brought out by other witnesses , she and her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife at dinner , Mrs. Aurelio said that she had been impressed by Mrs. Costello , whom she described as " very refined , very well dressed , neat , cultured . " On the night her husband was nominated , she said , Costello called their home and asked for him . ' Mrs. Aurelio said that her husband was not there , and that Costello asked her to have him call in the morning , giving her a telephone number for the purpose , which she , wrote on a scratch pad by the telephone . Mr. Sheridan asked her about her husband . " He 's a God-fearing man , a good father and an excellent husband , " she replied . " He 's always home nights . He 's an excellent man . I do n't think he could be better . " On cross-examination Mr. Hogan asked her only one question . He read her a newspaper clipping that quoted her as saying " I never heard of this man Costello . " " I may have said it , " she conceded . Aurelio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , with white shirt and collar , followed her to the witness chair . He leaned forward as he testified , as if eager to get his story to the public . He said that he was educated at public schools and at New York University , from which he got his law degree in 1917 ; that he enlisted and served overseas for eleven months , and that he became a deputy assistant district attorney in 1922 , and an assistant district attorney in 1928 . After nine years in the District Attorney 's office , he said , he was appointed a magistrate to fill a vacancy , and was reappointed by Mayor La Guardia four years later for a full term . He told of meeting Mr. Kennedy with a group of other Tammany district leaders at the New York Athletic Club shortly before Mr. Kennedy 's election as leader of Tammany . There was a discussion of the mistakes made by the previous leader , Mr. Sullivan , he said , and then the talk turned to the nominations for the Supreme Court . " Congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the leader of Tammany Hall , there 's the man I would have nominated , Tom Aurelio , ' " the witness said . Asked Mayor for Help Heartened by this remark , he went to work to organize support for his nomination , he said . He told of enlisting eighteen or twenty prominent individuals in various veterans ' organizations and of soliciting the help of other groups and individuals . He said that he went to Mayor La Guardia for help on two occasions , early in July and again the Saturday before the judicial convention . Mr. Aurelio testified that Joseph 8 . Lescalzo , an assistant district attorney of Queens County , who had been a close friend for twentyfive years , introduced him to Costello last February . " That was the first time I ever saw or heard of that man , " he exclaimed with feeling . He repeated the story told by previous witnesses of the March meeting in Mr. Kennedy 's office , and added that when Mr. Kennedy took him outside , - he said : " Your leader is behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising you nothing . It 's too early . 1I 'm considering it . " Other Worries Recalled He said he was disturbed during the summer over a report that Municipal Court Justice Joseph Raimo might be nominated for the Supreme Court to make a place for Representative Louis J. Capozzoli , whose district might be eliminated in the coming Congressional reapportionment , and that he asked Costello about it . " Costello said ' as a matter of fact every one believes you are ' going to get the nomination ; as a matter of fact it 's in the bag ' , " Mr. Aurelio testified . Nevertheless , he said , a few days later he went to see Mayor La Guardia a second time to ask him to put in a word for him with Mr. Kennedy . " I went to make sure there was nothing between times , " he explained . " In other words , it would n't do any harm . There 's always a last minute switch , you know . " Mr. Sheridan then started to ask him about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Referee Sears halted the proceedings before Mr. Aurelio could answer and adjourned the hearing until 10:30 o'clock this morning .
