For the Russians this was a day of hope and rejoicing . For the Germans it was cruel . After their 850-mile advance from the Prut to the Volga , they were back at the end of 1,009 days at the river where they started . <P> The road back had been very grueling . The last long lap in the Ukraine had not been a successful retirement but a major defeat , like Stalingrad . <P> The Germans had had every reason to think that they could take their time in retiring . They probably expected to hold the Russians on the River Bug until well into May . For the Ukraine , like a ship divided into many compartments , is divided by rivers running north and south , each of which forms a defense line : Behind the Dnieper lies the Bug , behind the Bug lies the Dniester , behind the Dniester lies the Prut . <P> But the Russian flood had leaped one barrier after another , leaped them so fast that before any compartment had been fully flooded , the next had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat was shown by the results : <P> The German Sixth Army ( reconstituted since Stalingrad ) chewed up on the Dnieper . <P> The Eighth Infantry and First Tank Armies wiped up between the Bug and the Dniester . <P> I Retreat of 75 German divisions into Poland and Rumania , with their strength mostly cut from 12,000 men in a division to 7,000 or 8,000 . <P> Capture of enough undamaged tanks ( many of them still loaded on railway cars ) to outfit five divisions . <P> I Capture at Proskurov of 4,300 loaded German trucks . <P> Even discounting some of these Russian claims , the booty captured by the Reds was obviously enormous . Booty and prisoners are the evidence that a drive has not merely captured territory but played havoc with the enemy 's army . With ' sev eral compartments of the Ukraine still only partly flooded , the possibility of more booty and prisoners was still promising . <P> Barrier Breaching . In Bessarabia last week the air was thick with the aroma of apple blossoms and Marshal Ivan Konev was there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his was the major credit for breaking through one compartment after another of the Ger man defenses . <P> To do this in mid-spring when the Ukraine is knee-deep in mud was a mili tary masterpiece . Marshal Malinovsky , commanding the part of the front directly adjoining the Black Sea , had probably done as well as could be expected , since his way lay across the broad estuaries of the big rivers . Marshal Zhukov , at the northern end of the Ukrainian front , had done very well by breaking through with heavy concentrations of guns and tanks into Bucovina . But Konev , in the center , had pushed farthest . He had already crossed the Bug and the Dniester . This week his army held a 50-mile front along the sandy Prut river , nowhere wider than 300 yards . <P> As much as a man could be , Konev was responsible for this miracle of a great offensive at mud-time . He produced it by turning to foot , man , and tank-power , by keeping his men on grueling marches few other armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lost without their trucks ; they want to ride-whether forward or backward .
