A British heritage , lime juice , * was much in evidence last week when Burmans held their first election under their own provisional government . At each of Rangoon 's polling booths stood a bottle of the juice , put there because of rumors that disorderly elements intended to throw sulphuric acid in the ballot boxes . The Burmans figured that the famed antiscorbutic was also the best anti-sulphuric . <P> But no acid was thrown . Communists dashed through the streets of Rangoon in a green jeep , shouting : " Rebellion , rebellion ! Rise , rise ! " A couple of polling booths outside the city were burned . The only bloodshed in Rangoon occurred when a constable accidentally discharged a shotgun into his foot . <P> As expected , young ( 32 ) Premier Aung San 's Anti-Fascist People 's Freedom League swept the elections . <P> <P> * British Naval Surgeon James Lind ( 1716-94 ) wondered enviously why sauerkraut-eating Dutch sailors got less scurvy than his tars on long voyages . He guessed right , recommended citrus fruits to supply what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer , First Lord of the Admiralty , ordered lemons or limes included in the daily diet on British ships . Soon British sailors and then the whole British people became known as " limeys . " " Limey " bears no etymological relation to " Blimey , " or to Limehouse , a London dock district named for an old lime kiln , or oast.
