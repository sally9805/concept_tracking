The cheapest freight rate between any two points on the U. S. railroad system used to be on carload lots . To ship three carloads or 100 did not reduce the rate be low that for one . For years the Interstate Commerce Commission has maintained that lower rates on big shipments would be free lunch for big business . On account of that , able John Lansing Beven , president of Illinois Central , was a pioneer last week . Up the I.C. tracks east of the Mississippi one of his locomotives dragged a 40-car lot of blackstrap molasses ( sugar refinery residue ) for 15 a cwt. , although the car load rate is 17 . I.C.C . had just granted him and other Mississippi Valley rail roaders the right to quote trainload rates on blackstrap . <P> It took a long time for Mr. Beven to make up his mind that such rates made good economic sense . About three years ago one of I. C. 's big customers , Commercial Solvents Corp. , doubled its barge fleet . Scared I. C. chewed its cud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In October it went to the I. C. C. with a petition for trainload rates on molasses . Month ago , I. C. C. brought forth its decision , that " . . . certain other forms of transportation which compete with the railroads can law fully , and do , give the shipper of large quantities a decided advantage over the shipper of lesser quantities equivalent to a railroad carload . This is true of pipeline transportation by its very nature , and it is also true of water transportation . " <P> John Beven expected to carry a trainload of blackstrap from New Orleans to Commercial Solvents ' plant at Peoria , Ill , every ten days or so this year , for some $200,000 . But the ultimate possibilities of the precedent are much bigger . If I. C. C. authorizes a rate that gets blackstrap out of barges , it may also fix similar rates for iron ore , lumber , coal , sugar , cottonseed oil - and a rate that keeps oil out of pipelines . At I. C. C. hearing Shell Oil Co. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars invested in pipelines ) argued against trainload rates . Biggest squawk may come from roads which fear barge competition less than price-cutting . <P> Trainload rates are not the first attempt of railroads to get back their onetime share of freight traffic . For some years roads have been combatting truck competition by resuming an old practice of running " redball " ( fast ) freights , freeing the tracks for them and sending them as much as 500 miles in a night . During 1939 : Union Pacific began to run one from Portland , Ore . to Boise , Idaho , another from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City , another from Denver to Kansas City . Southern Pacific started trains running overnight to Yuma and Phoenix , Ariz , from Los Angeles , Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe scheduled redball freights from Chicago to Texas in 24 hours , Chicago to Kansas City overnight .
