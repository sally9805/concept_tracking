JOSEPH THE PROVIDER-Thomas Mann , translated by H. T. Lowe-Porter-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> Last week Thomas Mann published the final volume of his major work . Few novelists in the history of literature have planned a work of such scope and significance , and made their plans come true . <P> Joseph the Provider finishes a masterpiece . It is a masterpiece in the way that Tolstoy 's novels are , rather than Shakespeare 's plays-i.e. , it is deliberate , sustained , careful ( often tiresomely so ) , rather than spontaneous and overflowing with its own imaginative energy . The final volume 's 606 pages bring the epic of Joseph to its end ( Bible version , 21 pages ; Mann 's version , 2,005 pages ) . Few readers will want to know all of Mann 's retelling of the story , the resuscitation of Egyptian and Hebrew thought and customs with which he surrounds it , the lessons for the modern world he derives from it . But no contemporary reader can afford not to know what is in Thomas Mann 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pit . Joseph in Egypt ended when Joseph , Potiphar 's powerful steward , was ruined by the false accusation of Potiphar 's wife . Potiphar sent him to the island fortress of Zawi-Re in Lower Egypt . When this volume opens , Joseph is a prisoner , brooding on the wreckage of his life and the mystery of Egypt , while a boat hustles him off to jail through the bustle of Egypt 's busiest highway , the Nile . Ashamed , defeated , heartsick , and yet never without a mild , detached humor and a powerful conviction of future triumph , Joseph thinks how much this imprisonment is like his first descent into the pit when his brothers stole his coat of many colors . <P> Mai-Sachme . The fortress of Zawi-Re was a group of gloomy buildings on an island in the Mendesian arm of the Nile . When Joseph first saw the prison he divined that he would be there three years . He was right . Joseph was 27 . Joseph 's jailer , the warden of Zawi-Re , was Mai-Sachme , a soldier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40. * Mai-Sachme made Joseph an overseer . Into the isolated life of genial Jailer Mai-Sachme , who was like an intelligent modern officer serving in a frontier post , Joseph brought a breath of the great world of Memphis and Thebes , the wild outland of Canaan . <P> For Joseph stood between two cultures-the crumbling , terrifying , brilliant , polytheistic life of the Egyptians , and the simple , severe , shepherd 's culture of the monotheistic Jews . His mind was filled with the ceaseless introspective poetry of comparison and analogy , prophecy and symbolism . He thought about the story of the Flood and its symbolic repetition in the tears of men . He compared the eerie legends of Egyptian mythology with the religious teachings of the Hebrews . He pondered upon the comparative meaning of sin . Sin for the Egyptians was not conscious wrongdoing , but more akin to a want of foresight . " It meant folly , it meant clumsy dealing with God , it was something to jeer at . Whereas wisdom meant foresight and care for the future . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
