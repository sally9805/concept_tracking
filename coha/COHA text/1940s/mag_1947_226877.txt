The headily perfumed world of fashion , whose journals are both arbiters and court reporters , has its own definition of news : the New Look . This time , for a change , it was really new , from round shoulders to sucked-in ( or laced-in ) waist to long skirt ( see NATIONAL AFFAIR ) . <P> Last week , after prophesying the most drastic style changes in a decade , the fashion magazines swept on to the crucial task of their year : rushing the news , sketches and pictures from the Paris and New York openings into print for their big fall numbers . Queenly Edna Woolman Chase , 70-year-old editor-in-chief of Vogue , bustled home from a quick inspection of her revived British and French editions . Pert Carmel Snow , 56 , editor of Harper 's Bazaar , was doing front-line duty in Paris . Both were ecstatic about derrieres , guepieres ( little waist corsets ) , and a French designer of " magnificent courage " named Christian Dior ( the man who , abetted by some Americans , first dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wartime material-hoarding order ) . <P> Diamond Dust . Fashion Is Spinach , wrote Designer Elizabeth Hawes ( in 1938 ) in a maverick mood . But to the fashion magazines the sand in he spinach is diamond dust . Last year , Vogue and Harper 's made more money than ever ( for Conde Nast Publications and Hearst , respectively ) . Their circulations ( Harper 's , 225,000 , plus 39,000 British ; Vogue , 304,000 , plus 100,700 British and 12,000 French ) are at an alltime peak . Recent issues have been skinnier than last year 's ad-fat ones , and to cut costs Vogue recently cut its output from 24 issues a year to 20 , boosting its price from 35 to match Harper 's ( 50 a month ) . <P> As leaders in a hotly competitive field , both magazines cover fashions at their source , report on what they like , and often like the same things . Both are read as much for their ads as for anything else . Both employ squads of bright , elegantly turned-out young fashion scouts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models with portraits of society women . Both are fawned over by publicity-hungry manufacturers . But they resent being taken for twins . Their differences are largely those that set apart two strong-minded women of ruthless , sometimes reckless taste . <P> Brown-eyed Edna Chase , mother of Actress-Author ( In Bed We Cry ) Ilka , has edited Vogue ever since 1914 , five years after the late Conde Nast bought it . In &; out of her chartreuse-and-beige office , she is a hard-to-please autocrat ( " my wastebasket is my strongest ally " ) . Her philosophy is frankly snobbish : " We are reflecting the way of life of people with wealth and taste and social position . " To help catch the reflections , Vogue has introduced to fashion coveys of high-priced painters ( Christian Berard , Edouard Benito ) and photographers ( Cecil Beaton , Edward Steichen , Anton Bruehl ) . Its fine arts man is puttery Frank Crowninshield , 75 , famed editor of famed Vanity Fair until Vogue gobbled it . Mrs. Chase and courtly Iva Sergei Voidato ( " Pat " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their pages , but no fiction . " It shows a lack of sustained thinking , " Pat thinks , " to run fiction in a fashion magazine . . . it is distracting . "
