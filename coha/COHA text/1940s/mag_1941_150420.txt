Last week Britain 's No. 1 economist arrived in the U.S. Off the Clipper stepped softspoken , twinkle-eyed , tall ( 6 ft. 1 in . ) John Maynard Keynes , on an undisclosed mission under the Lend-Lease Act . He also expected to see the President , whom he last saw in 1934 , when New Deal fiscal policies were in the blueprint stage . Keynes was the intellectual father of many of the New Deal 's more radical fiscal policies , notably deficit spending and low interest rates . Since then he has become the father of a war-financing plan for Britain . <P> An Eton and Oxford man , Keynes represented the British Treasury at the Peace Conference in 1919 . With prophetic foreboding he walked out on the Conference , wrote his scathing The Economic Consequences of the Peace , which made him famous overnight . He called Lloyd George a " Welsh witch , " and Woodrow Wilson a " nonconformist minister . . . whose mind was slow and unadaptable . " Most of what he predicted came true and people began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still knife-witted , but illness and study have stooped his shoulders , given him the gentle manner of Mr. Chips . Off the job , his chief interest is the ballet . In 1925 he married a Russian ballerina , Lydia Lopokova . An art collector , a member of the potent Bloomsbury group , he is one of Britain 's top-ranking intellectuals and business pundits ( as chairman of a life insurance company , National Mutual ) . But to the Government he remained an outsider , like Churchill , until the failures of World War II forced Tories and Labor alike to adopt ( in part ) his Compulsory Savings Plan . <P> The Plan assumes that when the ceiling on Britain 's capacity to produce consumer goods has been reached the people are left with excess purchasing power , which they will not voluntarily invest in Government bonds . Since only 200 people in England still have incomes ( after taxes ) exceeding $20,000 a year , most of the excess purchasing power is in the hands of the working class . <P> Instead of taxing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it , impound the rest into savings accounts . ' After the war . these compulsory savings will be returned with interest , giving war workers a stake in the Peace and also providing a cushion of consumer spending for the post-war slump . Only alternative , besides runaway inflation , says Keynes , is to peg the price of everything as Germany has done . <P> All last year this plan was a storm center in Parliament . Sir Robert Kindersley called it a barefaced bribe , said it smelled of totalitarianism . Laborites called it a disguised wage cut . Sir John Simon , then Chancellor of the Exchequer , said that the patriotic motive was enough to make people save . But time proved him wrong . The Exchequer has partially adopted compulsory savings . Next autumn automatic wage deferments ( on a complex sliding scale ) will begin in Britain . <P> Mr. Keynes did not intend his plan for the U.S. Last July he wrote in the New Republic that since the U.S. had enormous untapped capacity for consumer-goods production , the defense program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a higher standard of life . " Those words , he said last week , were written " a long time ago . "
