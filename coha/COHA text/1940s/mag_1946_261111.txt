During the war , California Shipbuilding Corp . built 467 ships worth some $1,000,000,000 . But shortly after V-J day , Calship 's payroll dropped to 800 from its wartime peak of 42,500 ; its 14 ways were sold for lumber . Calship President John A. McCone and Board Chairman Stephen Bechtel found themselves heading a company reportedly worth $14,000,000 , most of it in cash . With nothing to make , they wanted to find a use for their cash . <P> They found their answer in Sunnyvale 's Joshua Hendy Iron Works , largest machinery maker in the West Coast . California 's famed " Six Companies , " which built Boulder Dam and owned Calship , already owned a controlling interest in Hendy . They decided it was time to own it all . So they bought out the 25% interest of Hendy President Charles E. Moore , who had other business interests and no taste for the strike which had shut Hendy 's San Francisco plant . As the new president of Hendy , McCone took on the job of settling the strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unionists led by Sam Hendy , grandnephew of company founder Joshua Hendy , still held out . ) Now McCone could talk about Hendy 's future . <P> Things to Do . As a working member of the earth-moving Six Companies , Hendy will specialize in cranes , power shovels , dump-truck bodies , etc. , will have a sizable market in the Six Companies alone . It also plans to produce any other machinery the new industrial West needs . Already Hendy has a backlog of $10,000,000 . President McCone expects to boost sales to $3,000,000 a month . <P> These plans were a far cry from Hendy 's beginnings as a mining machinery company , 90 years ago . In 1940 , Hendy had only 60 employes , was so shaky that Moore and the Six Companies combine bought the whole outfit for $400,000 , intending to turn a quick profit by selling its machinery on the secondhand market . <P> One fat Navy contract changed their minds . Before the war was over , Hendy had : 1 ) produced $225,000,000 worth of equipment ( including engines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded to a 55-acre plant employing at its war peak 7,500 workers . Hendy 's most spectacular achievement : when the Navy needed 252 rocket launchers in a hurry for the invasion of Kwajalein , Hendy produced them in 176 hours . <P> Man to Do Them . Quiet , levelheaded John McCone , 44 , is just the man to keep Hendy on the job . His family has been in the machinery business since 1860 , and McCone himself spent 15 years working for Consolidated Steel Corp . He left in J937 to join the Six Companies . During the war , he normally put in seven 15-hour days a week running Calship along with Bechtel-McCone 's B-29 outfitting plant in Birmingham , Ala . His tough formula : set production goals higher than anyone thought could be met , then make sure they were met . <P> Last week , with Hendy 's strike settled , McCone took his first vacation in about six years . Friends doubted if he could stop working . When they visited him at his five-acre estate in San Marino , they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new swimming pool .
