The news was magnificent , and it flowed in a full tide . <P> The first flush of elation over U.S. landings in Africa had hardly died when the Navy told of smashing the Jap in the Solomons . Never before had the full realization of global war been hammered home so hard in one week-and out of the bitter fighting America had a new pride in itself . <P> Global war no longer meant merely scattering troops to the ends of the earth ; it now meant fighting bitter , agonizing battles 14,000 miles apart against full enemy forces . This was it : meeting the enemy face to face , ship for ship , tank for tank , plane for plane-and now , for a change , winning , at least sometimes . <P> The week was comparable to no other for the U.S. in World War II . As the battle of Africa unfolded , as the U.S. people learned the magnitude of the convoys and rubbed their eyes over the spy mission of tall Lieut . General Mark W. Clark , as they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they knew that at last , after a year of humiliation , they were active and aggressive participants at Armageddon . In the tank and plane factories , in the ammunition plants and the shipyards , there was good reason to work harder than ever . <P> Fast Pulse . The African campaign would be tough , they knew ; but girding for battle with the Nazis had a terrible sweetness to it . And in the Solomons , where individual fighting by U.S. troops has been more desperate than in any other spot , there were happenings to make the national pulse race . For days the Navy had merely hinted at what might be a final showdown . The U.S. people kept their fingers crossed . The three-day battle over , the Navy released its jubilant communiqu . <P> But there was a sobering sense of the tasks still to be done-hard and painful and bloody . If anyone did not know this , he was given a jolting reminder by the wiry , keen commander of U.S. Ground Forces . Said Lieut . General Lesley J. McNair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must hate with every fiber of our being . We must lust for battle ; our object in life must be to kill ; we must scheme and plan night and day to kill . There need be no pangs of conscience , for our enemies have lighted the way to faster , surer , crueler killing . They are past masters . We must hurry to catch up with them if we are to survive . . <P> " Let no one of you be the super-optimist and conclude that this is the beginning of the end . It is only another great stride forward in our part of the war . Our great advance guard overseas must be followed by a great main body-or else . "
