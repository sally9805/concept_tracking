EVEN though the owner of an oil burner will usually want to call in a regular service man to handle major troubles , there are real advantages to understanding a burner and its controls . This knowledge will permit the owner to make his own minor repairs and adjustments , and will be particularly handy on a cold winter day when an interruption of service occurs that can be remedied by " know-how " and five minutes of work . An oil-burner installation requires at least three controls : a thermostat , a combination stack switch and relay , and a high-limit control . There is a wide variety of special controls , and many different types and makes of equipment are in general use . For reasons of simplicity we will examine here a gun-type burner having just the three basic controls . With some modifications , the same procedures can be applied to other burners . The operating cycle of the burner is as follows : When the thermostat " calls for heat " by closing its contacts , a low voltage is applied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This supplies 115-volt current to the ignition coil and the motor . Ignition takes place and the burner begins operation . In back of the stack unit , projecting into the smoke pipe , a bimetal heat-sensitive element is located . It reacts to temperature changes within the stack either by sliding or twisting a shaft that opens or closes contacts within the stack unit . In the unit shown in the picture directly below , heat causes the shaft to turn to the right , operating a mercury switch and two other sets of contacts located behind and below it . Two of these , open at the start of the cycle , are known as the " hot " contacts ; the others , closed at the start , are the " cold " contacts . A final component is a safety switch with a thermal element that will pass current  | for only a measured length of time before it opens . To resume with the operating cycle : the burner flame produces heat in the stack , causing the bimetallic unit to turn to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety switch and allowing the burner to continue in operation . Meanwhile the cold contacts open , breaking the starting circuit , and the mercury switch is tilted to the right , opening the ignition circuit , which is not needed for continued operation in the burner described . Certain other burners employ continuous ignition and have a slightly different stack control . If the oil fails to ignite , due either to fuel or ignition failure , there is no heat in the stack to actuate its bimetallic element . Since the hot contacts then remain open , they can not shunt the safety switch , and after a short time this trips open . The burner can not now be returned to operation or attempted operation until the manual reset button is pressed . Suppose again that the burner is in normal operation and runs out of fuel . As the stack temperature drops , the hot contacts will open ; and since the cold contacts are already open , no circuit exists through the relay coil and this stops the motor . After about one minute the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the burner will attempt to start . If the fuel stoppage continues the safety switch will cut off this attempt to start ; if the fuel supply is restored , the burner will operate normally . Finally , suppose that , because of a high thermostat setting in cold weather , the thermostat is still calling for heat at a time when the burner has built up water temperature or steam pressure to the upper safe limit . The high-limit switch then intervenes to cut off the burner , regardless of thermostat demand , until the temperature or pressure drops . In a steam-heating system this unit may be either a pressure-sensitive ( diaphragm ) type or a temperature-sensitive one ; in a hot-water or hot-air system , the latter kind is used . Start your annual oil-burner service-check by cleaning out the inside of the boiler and stack . ' Place a piece of cardboard in the firebox and scrape out all deposits from around the boiler sections . A stiff wire brush on a long handle will be useful . Even better , if you have one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can also be used to clean the stack .  | Do n't be tempted to cut short this job simply because it is a dirty task ; the accumulated soot can cause extra fuel consumption and retarded delivery of heat . The next step is to check the firebox for broken or loose firebrick or cement . Breaks in the firewall may allow the flame to get through to the boiler base , burning a hole through it or otherwise causing damage . After replacing any defective brickwork , clean out the firebox with the brush or vacuum cleaner . As a general rule , the control units of an automatic heating system need little attention . Remove the cover of the thermostat and blow out any dust and lint . Inspect the contacts ; if they are clean , simply draw a strip of paper between to remove any tiny dust particles . If they appear dirty or pitted , gently draw a piece of fine sandpaper between them . Do not disturb the adjustments if regulation has been satisfactory ; if not , either call in a trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settings . In most cases the stack-switch unit also will need little attention , although it is a good plan to blow out any dust and to clean the contacts gently . The adjustments that govern the timing and control of the operating cycle are usually made at the factory or during installation , and they will as a rule remain correct indefinitely . Use no oil in any circumstance in either the thermostat or stack unit . The high-limit switch calls for no attention unless damaged or worn out . Apply a few drops of medium motor oil to the lubricating cups of the motor , and repeat this about every two months of operation . Do not add too much oil , since it might injure the windings of the motor or the centrifugal starting switch . After the tank has been filled , check along the line for fuel leaks . Wet or dripping unions or valves should be tightened or replaced . If a slowly spreading oil patch appears on the cement floor under which the copper fuel line runs , first check the nearest couplings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain spreads , it will probably be necessary to break into the cement over the supply line , solder or replace the tubing , and re-cement the floor . In a thorough servicing job , the internal parts of the burner should be withdrawn from the air tube for inspection and cleaning . Shut off the oil supply , open the main switch , and disconnect the oil line at the  | side of the burner . Remove the back cover on the burner and , reaching inside , pull the high-voltage cables free from their sockets in the side of the transformer . The entire unit can then be removed , as shown on page 181 . After wiping the parts clean , examine for broken or cracked porcelain insulators and for imperfect cable insulation . The electrodes at the end should be spaced i " to 3/16 " apart , and should be located just out of the direct vapor spray from the nozzle . The nozzle itself can be removed with two wrenches and the strainer behind it cleaned of its gummy sludge . Many nozzles can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whirl chamber are exposed for cleaning and inspection . Use great care in handling the nozzle , since the machining is precise and the careless use of tools can irreparably damage the tiny oil channels . Clean the parts with a soft brush and fresh kerosene , wipe dry , and examine under a magnifying glass for signs of wear or roughness . See that the orifice in the end is open , but use only a piece of very fine brass wire to clean it . The smoothness of the internal surface and the concentricity of the assembled parts determine the quality of the flame and the rate of fuel consumption . After replacing the parts in the burner , turn on the oil , close the line switch , and let the burner start . When the flame has reached a stable form , make sure it fans out and carries back normally . The fuel should burn completely , with a clean , hot flame . A smoky fire may indicate a dirty or defective nozzle or an insufficient air supply . It may also mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nozzle , more than can be properly vaporized and burned . Usually , careful adjustment of oil pressure and air supply will produce a satisfactory flame . The method of oil-pressure adjustment varies with different types of burners ; if the information is not placarded on the burner , write to the manufacturer . The air supply is adjusted by moving the sliding cover in the blower housing . As a rule the high-voltage transformer will cause little trouble , though it can burn out or become partially shorted and produce poor ignition . If careful checking of the wiring and controls point to the transformer as a probable source of difficulty , remove it to the bench for testing . Connect the 115-volt A.C. line to the primary and provide a suitable gap for the secondary voltage to jump , using high-tension cable . Use extreme caution against shock . The transformer should deliver a flaming arc 3z " long or more . A thin blue spark or no spark at all indicates the transformer should be replaced . Another test , if a wattmeter and ammeter are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compare readings with those taken from a similar transformer known to be in good condition . Unless the secondary is centertapped , there should be no circuit to the ground or case ; if a series test shows that one exists , the transformer is shorted.  |
