RECONVERSION Facts &; Figures <P> This week 30,000 telegrams tersely can celing the bulk of Army war contracts were ready to be sent to U.S. industry . <P> With one swoop the Army would wipe out : <P> More than 95% of its orders for carbon and alloy steels , copper , aluminum , artillery , tanks , guns , railroad rolling stock , telephone , radio and telegraph equipment . <P> More than 75% of its orders for cotton and wool textiles , leather , lumber , shoes . <P> More than two-thirds of its orders for tires . <P> That would make reconversion a fact , not just an overworked word . Total industrial production , now humming along at the rate of over $130 billion a year , could be pushed down almost one-third . <P> Plans &; Prospects . Industry was ready for the cancellations . It had discarded the notion that a tapering-off in war orders would cushion the reconversion shock . <P> How quickly industry could regain its equilibrium depended upon how quickly it could : 1 ) clear its plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady supply of raw materials ; 3 ) get a firm pricing policy from OPA . <P> The reconversion outlook for some representative U.S. companies : GOODYEAR TIRE &; RUBBER CO . Output of tires and plastics for civilians can begin immediately . Estimated postwar employment : 30% greater than the prewar peak of 28,561 , but only 30% of their 1942 wartime employment peak . <P> <P> BENDIX AVIATION CORP . Sales-smart Bendix was busy during the war lining up a nationwide distribution organization while its factories were spouting $2.8 billion of war goods . Soon these distributors will have something to sell . Bendix plants making auto parts will be in mass production by late fall . New type AM and FM radio sets can roll off the assembly lines immediately . <P> GENERAL MOTORS CORP . G.M. 's problem is typical of all auto manufacturers . It needs new machine tools , must rid its plants of heavy war machinery . ( Pontiac has long been mapping its new-assembly lines- ) . G.M. must also accumulate a huge supply of raw materials ( steel , textiles , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are licked , G.M. has high hopes for the future . Its ultimate employment goal : 400,000 factory workers ( 1939 high : 201,000 ) ; 200,000 distributors ( 1939 total : 150,000 ) . <P> WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP . Cancellation of its $400 million backlog of war orders will free Westinghouse for a quick changeover to refrigerators , electric irons , and other appliances for civilians . Two new postwar products : a deep-freeze unit for home use , a dishwashing machine to sell for less than $100 . <P> E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS &; Co . Nylon and Nylon yarn for stockings , Neoprene synthetic rubber , most chemical products and plastic materials can be switched to civilian use as soon as the cancellation telegrams reach Wilmington . <P> ALUMINUM COMPANY OF AMERICA . War orders will be sorely missed . Alcoa has delivered $2.2 billion of aluminum and magnesium since war began , still has a backlog of war orders totaling $200 million . But orders on hand from civilian industries amount to a mere $26 million-equal to two weeks ' present aluminum production .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
