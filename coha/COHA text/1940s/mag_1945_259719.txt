Homeless veterans got a mite of help last week in their house hunting . The Civilian Production Administration slapped a priorities system on building materials , to start Jan. 15 . In 1946 it hopes to funnel them into some 400,000 new homes for veterans costing $10,000 and less . <P> CPAdministrator John D. Small listed ten critical building materials* which will be affected by the priorities program . Special " HH " priorities will be issued by Federal Housing Administration field offices to veterans who want to build houses , or to professional builders , providing that they will hold their houses for rent or sale to veterans for 30 days after they are built . To get priorities , applicants will have to prove to FHA that they will be ready to start construction within 60 days . <P> Priority houses will have to sell for $10,000 or less , including the land , or rent for $80 a month or less . And any veteran , or private builder , who sells his house must abide by a set schedule of prices . Roughly half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed will be set aside for holders of priorities . <P> As some 3,000,000 veterans will need homes , CPA is prepared to set up a regional quota system to parcel out priorities . But few veterans , or anyone else , thought that such priorities would solve the housing shortage . Not many veterans can afford a $10,000 house ; the great need is for houses at $6,000 and under . <P> *Bricks , clay sewer pipe , structural tile , gypsum board , gypsum lath , cast-iron soil pipe and fittings , cast-iron radiation , bathtubs , lumber and millwork.
