At the head of New Brunswick 's Bay of Fundy , the tides average 35 ft . Twice a day a wall of roaring white water , called the " bore , " rushes up the winding Petitcodiac River , then ebbs lazily back to sea . <P> For 25 years a New Brunswick inventor named Rupert Turnbull has dreamed of building dams using Fundy 's tides to generate an estimated 400,000 h.p. * If the tides can be effectively harnessed , if Inventor Turnbull 's particular plan is good , the Maritimes would get cheaper electricity , postwar employment . <P> To put his plan over , Turnbull has wrangled persistently with skeptical experts , out of his own well filled pockets has paid for surveys . Last week , before the Canadian Senate 's Harbors Committee , he wrangled some more . This time he got tentative action . The Committee 's decision : " immediate " investigation . <P> The Dreamer . At 73 , Rupert Turnbull is stoop-shouldered , spry , twinkle-eyed , enthusiastic . A native of St. John , N.B. , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heidelberg , got his first job as a General Electric Co. engineer at Newark . In 1899 he inherited a fortune from his banker father , soon returned to New Brunswick to experiment in the new science of aerodynamics . <P> While the Wright brothers were still making their fledgling , flights , Inventor Turnbull was building Canada 's first wind tunnel . Later he concentrated on aircraft propellers . To test homemade ones , he constructed a 300-ft. railway , mounted props on flatcars , learned which kinds had the greatest pull . His neighbors thought him mad . The upshot : patents on an electric controllable-pitch propeller , for which he draws royalties from such war-busy plants as Curtiss-Wright and Britain 's Bristol Aeroplane Co . <P> His interest in Petitcodiac is largely philanthropic . He heads the Petitcodiac Tidal Power Co. , which holds development rights . But he told the Senate Committee that his firm wants no money for the rights . Rupert Turnbull only wants to see , before he dies , a longtime dream come true . <P> * There have been other plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Roosevelt 's short-lived Passamaquoddy Project .
