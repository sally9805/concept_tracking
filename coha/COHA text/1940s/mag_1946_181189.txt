The No. 1 Communist in the U.S. , the mouthpiece of Moscow 's serpentine line and the brain of the party 's policies here , is a man named Gerhart Eisler . So , last week , said a man who ought to know : Louis Francis Budenz , the former managing editor of the Daily Worker who forsook Communism for Catholicism ( TIME , Oct. 22 , 1945 ) . It was Eisler , said Budenz , who gave him directives right from the Kremlin 's mouth . <P> So also said another former Red who should know : Ruth Fischer , a onetime noisy leader of the Communist Party in pre-Nazi Germany 's Reichstag . She is Eisler 's sister . They hate each other furiously . <P> Brotherly Love . Gerhart Eisler is a chunky , bright-eyed , 49-year-old German who has been in the U.S. for five years . Last week he and his slender , 35-year-old wife , Brunhilda , were packed and read ) ' to sail to Germany . Then the State Department suddenly took back its permission for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City apartment , balding Gerhart Eisler spouted " ridiculous . . . stupid . . . nonsense " at the idea that he was a super-secret agent of Kremlin policy . <P> Of course he was a Communist , he said , but a German one , who had taken no part in the U.S. party 's business . He was just a writer for something called the German-American . He had helped out on a book , The Lesson of Germany . He often used the pen name Hans Berger . <P> Gerhart Eisler-Berger has the background and the intellectual equipment for the role of The Brain . He and sister Ruth were the children of a Viennese scholar-philosopher . Gerhart was one of the founders of Austria 's Communist Party . In Germany , in the early ' 20s , he and sister Ruth were at the top of opposing Red factions-she the flamboyant leader of the violent revolutionaries , he the quiet theoretician of the " reconcilers. " * <P> In the Spotlight . It was Gerhart ( he says ) who got sister Ruth tossed out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , which the Communists call " a gutter sheet " ) . Gerhart went on to Moscow , presumably as a reliable Comintern cog . From then on his role was that of many a Red agent-tours of duty in the Far East , in Spain with the Loyalists , back to Germany , then to France when Hitler rose to power . Eisler and his wife got out of France in 1941 on a U.S. transit visa , stayed in New York City when regulations blocked their intended journey to Mexico . <P> Had Louis Budenz put the spotlight on the real Brain of U.S. Communism ? Those who know Communists best thought that if Gerhart Eisler was not the top man he was surely one of the top man 's top men . They also thought it was smart to keep him in the U.S.-a well-trained German Communist could be much more troublesome to the U.S. in Germany than he could , under the spotlight , in the U.S. itself . <P> Said Eisler : " Ah , believe me , it is not a pleasure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they wo n't let me go back where I came from . " <P> <P> * Their brother is Hanns Eisler , left-wing Hollywood cinema composer . No stranger to Moscow he wrote a battle song , Komintern , many others hailed by the Daily Worker as Marxist music .
