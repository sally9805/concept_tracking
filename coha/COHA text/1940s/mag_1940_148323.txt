MEN IN CHAINS-Thomas Ryan-Random House ( $2.50 ) . <P> Whatever Thomas Ryan 's failings , he does not lack for ambition . In ten stories , prologue and epilogue , he tries to nail Man to the map in terms of his leading forms of bondage and self-martyrdom . There are quite a few writers more maturely qualified for such a task but disregard of that fact is one of Ryan 's naive virtues , which he shares with most first and some second-rate writers . So in spite of its inadequacies , his rawboned , cornfed volume carries much to be respected in itself . <P> His first four stories are ancient history ; 1 ) a martyred pathfinder , before 7000 B.C. prototype of Osiris , of Jesus , of the Artist ; 2 ) a dim-witted burglar vivisected by Alexandrian scientists ( Result : " We have now proved . . . that the arteries circulate air to the body from the lungs . ... It makes a man proud to be a doctor " ) ; 3 ) Spartacus and his terrific slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a martyr to man 's habit of tyrannizing over his fellowman . " The four with the U. S. as their setting are studies respectively of cowardice , burnt-out genius , sexual fever as a product of Mississippi Valley boredom , acute alcoholism . The Coward , well-worn in plot and people , is psychologically good &; scary ; The Defective is rather sketched than brought off . The Bad Girl describes provincial ennui and sexual despair with a good deal of intensity . The Drunkard , the best thing in the book , is a scalding and ghastly story of speak-easy newswriters , a maladjusted comedian . If uneven Author Ryan ever tightens the whole of his talent to that pitch , he will have justified his bold ambitions .
