The air speed record , inching closer to the critical speed of sound , moved up a double notch . At Muroc Dry Lake , Calif. , the Navy 's Douglas Skystreak ( 0-558 ) , piloted by Commander Turner F. Caldwell , zipped four times over a three-kilometer course at the average speed of 640.7 m.p.h . This was 16.9 m.p.h. faster than the record set ( on June 19 ) by Lockheed 's P-80R . Then last week , five days later , Marine Major Marion Carl ( credited with 18 Japanese planes ) took the Skystreak up again . Flying at times only 25 feet above the desert , he averaged 650.6 m.p.h . <P> According to the up-to-date method of measuring airplane speeds ( in " mach numbers " ) , the second flight of the Skystreak was no better than the first . During both flights it reached " mach .828 . " This means that both times it moved at 82.8% of the speed that sound would travel through the same air . While Commander Caldwell was flying the Skystreak , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Carl took the controls , it was 94 F. Sound travels faster in hot air , so the speed of sound at the course moved up too , keeping Pilot Carl 's speed in " mach numbers " the same as Pilot Caldwell's.
