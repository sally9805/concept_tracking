A new season opened on Broadway last week-with a play that closed after seven performances . Called Sundown Beach , it was a sad little thing in both subject matter and treatment-a bungled tale of flyers who had cracked up mentally in the war and were trying to get out of a convalescent hospital back into life . The new season 's second offering , Morey Amsterdam 's Hilarities , was far more gaily conceived but not much more happily executed . It proved to be a generally cheesy vaudeville show redeemed here &; there by a sort of primitive showmanship.
