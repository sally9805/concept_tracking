On Federal statute books since 1863 has been a queer old law passed to curb Civil War profiteering . The law : any citizen who learned of fraud against the U. S. could sue to recover the losses for his Government , plus as much again for him to keep for his pains . For a long time a young Pittsburgh lawyer named Morris Leo Marcus has believed that there was life in the old statute yet . Last week his theory proved to be worth $157,550 . <P> Indicted by the Justice Department 's Thurman Arnold last year were Pittsburgh 's Electrical Contractors Association and twelve member firms . The charge , on which they were fined $54,000 after pleading no contest : conspiracy to defraud the Government of about $745,000 by rigging prices on PWA projects . Mr. Marcus promptly sued the contractors under the 1863 law . <P> Marcus found his Government , which had since passed the Sherman Act and no longer needs such " informers , " an unwilling partner . ( If the suit succeeded , it might inspire enough 1863-model lawsuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Thurman Arnold 's records , Marcus threatened to subpoena everybody in the Justice Department . But once the case went to trial , his luck picked up . On the witness stand he placed Robert Carrnack , manager of the contractors ' association for twelve years . Carmack , himself a defendant , amazed his fellows by waiving his right to refuse to testify . Instead , for three long weeks he told the whole sorry story of how the association had hiked prices , determined who would be the low bidder and at what figure . <P> After the longest trial in Pennsylvania history ( 60 days of testimony ) , the jury last week awarded Marcus $315,100.91 , double the amount of the Government losses which it found that he had proved . Unless a higher court reverses the decision , Mr. Marcus and his unenthusiastic Government will profit by $157,550.45 each .
