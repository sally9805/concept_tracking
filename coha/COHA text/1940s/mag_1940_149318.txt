After four years , spent tabulating statistics from every congregation in the country , the Bureau of the Census last week released a U. S. religious census for 1936 ( first since 1926 ) . It made sad reading for the devout . Though church membership had risen in the decade from 54,576,346 to 55,807,366 , the percentage of increase was well under that for the population as a whole . Worse still , church expenditures had dropped from $817,214,528 in 1926 to $518,953,571 in 1936 , and the value of church buildings from $3,839,500,610 to $3,411,875,467 . <P> New sects swelled the total number of U. S. religious bodies from 213 to 256 , though the number of church buildings was reduced during the decade from 232,154 to 199,302 . The Roman Catholics , largest single church , showed an increase of 1,309,934 ( total : 19,914,937 members ) . Jewish congregations rose 559,942 to 4,641,184 . Most major Protestant churches showed a decline : Baptists from 8,441,030 to 8,262,287 ; Methodists from 8,070,619 to 7,001,637 ; Presbyterians from 2,625,284 to 2,513,653 ; Episcopalians from 1,859,086 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congregational &; Christian Church from 994,491 to 976,388 ; Quakers from 110,422 to 93,697 . Gainers included the Lutherans ( 3,965,152 to 4,245,160 ) , Mormons ( 606,561 to 774,169 ) , the Evangelical &; Reformed Church ( 675,804 to 723,877 ) , Christian Scientists ( 202,098 to 268,915 ) , Seventh-Day Adventists ( 110,998 to 133,254 ) , the Salvation Army ( 74,768 to 103,038 ) . <P> Smallest sect reporting was the Friends ( Primitive ) , whose lone congregation had 14 members . Most remarkable sect : the Two - Seed - in - the - Spirit Predestinarian Baptists ( 16 churches , 201 members ) , who believe that Adam &; Eve were infused with a " good seed " from God , that Eve received a " bad seed " from Satan . Since everyone is born of either a good seed or a bad seed , and nothing can be done about it , this church does no gospel preaching , no missionary work .
