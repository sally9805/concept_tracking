THE BULWARK - Theodore Dreiser-Doubleday ( $2.75 ) . <P> Shortly before he died , the late , great Theodore Dreiser finished two novels , the first he had written in 20 years . The Stoic , which will not be published until fall , completes the towering trilogy on U.S. business which was begun with The Financier ( 1912 ) and continued in The Titan ( 1914 ) . * The Bulwark , which he had meditated for some 30 years , is an unpretentious , fitting valedictory . <P> For years , Puritans attacked most of Dreiser 's novels tooth &; nail for their frankness and coarseness . The Bulwark is Dreiser 's tender tribute to all that was good in the forces which most bitterly attacked him . <P> Religion v. Materialism . Solon Barnes is a Quaker , brought up in unworldliness . He marries ( for love ) into a richer family of Friends and becomes a Philadelphia banker . For many years he floats along on uneasy rationalizations about the sacred stewardship of wealth ( which he honestly tries to live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank deeper &; deeper in crooked , within-the-law self-interest , he can stay silent no longer . In part the novel is a study of the losing struggle between the moribund U.S. religious sense and proliferating U.S. materialism . <P> But Dreiser was far less a theorist than a humanist ; essentially his novel is not a social thesis but the timeless story of family life . Of Solon 's five children , one is set apart by her homeliness ; one is a born Pharisee ; one is a self-conscious beauty ; one is an artist ; one is a natural cavalier . Dreiser is interested mainly in the two latter , the arch-rebels . Against them Solon Barnes finds sternness and tolerance equally ineffective . His son and daughter , in the struggle to come to life as autonomous human beings , become thieves , and worse . The soberly beautiful family group grows rigid with reluctant tyranny , ugly with fear and deceit . The beloved and charming home becomes , for some members of the family , a place of captivity , distaste and boredom . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repentance and ultimate religious conversion of another . <P> The story has been told many times , and more dramatically , but seldom with more balanced compassion or gentler insight . The Bulwark 's closing chapters , in which Solon Barnes realizes what his good intentions have wrought , and is battered into a simpler , humbler kind of religious understanding , are of a searching , level , melancholy beauty which can not be expected of any living American writer .
