This urge to extend Nature to the utmost has been the bread and butter of my profession . The wealthy Easterners who winter in Southern California sunshine want their gardens at their prime then , and since they can not be there to plan in summer for the months that follow , a ghost gardener mustdo the job for them . The stars of llallywood are too busy or too inexperienced to undertake to outdo their neighbors , and so I am employed by one to outdo myself , because I work for the neighbor too . So far , I have worked on but one actual million-dollar garden , M r . Hearst 's .

Fortunately so , too , because a drought dried up the streams of Laurel Canyon . and Cahuenga Pass , which supplied the new town with water . There were no waterworks to tap and no tanks in which to haul water , and the founders were in desperate straits to save their trees . That is , until one of them had an idea that was terrific , for the day . Hurrying to Los Angeles , he hired all the wagons he could find , with drivers , and headed them for the farms north of Long Beach . The farmers had a bumper crop of watermelons , which he soon cornered .

Thomas , the faunae ; originator of roses , did n't , when he built his lOri:4111-tiled , white-walled Spanish hacienda in Beverly Hills . The captain had a flair for tropical fruits , and he wanted them right now . He wanted at least a hundred full-grown trees in his new garden , and his list . included such spiteful items as camphor , rubber and sandalwood trees , and Dammam . from which shellac is made .

He wanted to do it as soon as he moved into his new house , which was rising out of a bare knoll . " Well , we can do it , but it will cost a lot of money , " I said . " How much is a lot of money ? " " At least twenty thousand dollars . " " Twenty thousand is pileup for the kind of a garden a man wants , " he said . " Go ahead with it . " So we moved in the trees , some of them weighing twenty-five tons , boxed , which is a lot of pounds to handle . Some of them were hearing fruit when we planted them . The garden was everything the captain expected , At least , so he said . But one day while he was picking guavas or IllaW0eS. a modest , almost shy , former professor of mathematics came along . lie , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with this one . He made an offer for it , which Captain Thomas accepted . After the property changed hands , I found myself landscaping for Al ilttin Sills , the movie star , and Doris Kenyon , his wife . Gardens in Hollywood have a habit of shifting owners like that . The trees and shrubs and vines go on and on , but the owners come and go . Two brothers came clown from Canada and perfected the art of throwing custard pies . The art grew into an industry known as Christ inc Comedies , The eomedies poured dollars into the laps of Charles and Al Christie , who spent guard it ice of Iheirnewly made wealth to build a grand home for their mother and themselves . It was known as Waverly . The home took shape as a vast English manor house ? rising out of the broad Beverly acres .

A landscaper is no exception . My break came in an odd way . Three architects , Pierpont and Walter Davis and Henry Withey , had agreed to design , build , laielseape , decorate and furnish a Moorish villa atop a hill at Edenvale for Julian Eltinge , the famous impersonator of female roles . Part of the deal was that they were to have food and a cook in the house and a meal on the table , ready to eat. , when Eltinge returned tam a. tour .

Pomegranates , Valencia oranges , Mission figs , Spanish brooms , oleanders . I 'd find it gay warm-eountry flower for color every day in the year , with Mexican nasturtiums for winter , mons de off , and tuberoses for spring , red and yellow zinnias for summer , Mexican hops forautumn .

" After that , I was a landscaper to the movie stars because the El tinge villa won a IltIti011atawa  --  d.which brought attendant publicity . The owner had the good sense to retire while he was at the peak , still mucking his " three grand a week . " One of Julian El tinge 's friends was Cecil B. De Mille , whohasallowed me to pour in quarter of n million dollars into two gardens , ! " egarozma TON THE STAIRM ICanrinued from Page 19 , fortunately , and not one . Gardening is a hobby ( billet &; for two people to follow on the same plot of earth . The best answer is two gardens , even if they are only two corners in the same plot . Otherwise , he has to be the gardener and she the severest critic , or vice versa . At first I thought I was in for a kettle of trouble when the famous producer called me over to plan the garden for his seven-acre place , Laughlin Park , on another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likes flowers that run to blues and yellows . His idea of something gorgeous is a blood-red rose , which would run riot in a well-planned garden . But the wise De Milles , believing in giving each other a break , had already decided who was boss . She ruled in the home garden at Hollywood . He was supreme at Paradise , their country place on crystalline Gold Creek , three thousand feet up in the Sierra Madre Mountains . Only once did he get out of bounds on this deal . Like most Southern California estates . Laughlin Park was equipped with sprinklers for making rain in the dry summer months . They are not just a luxury , but a necessity . Many and ingenious are the devices for turning them on and off . The De Mille sprinklers were automatic , but , while we were not looking , he had I a gang of plumbers come and detour the water pipes up the side of the house to a deck where he slept out-of-doors . The valves that controlled the water were right beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he apologized sheepishly . " When I do , I like tau make it rain , so I can go to sleep again . " When Mrs. De drills and I sat down in the Library to discuss the combinations of blue lilies of the Nile and yellow day lilies , the blue and yellow irises , the February gold daffodils , the cream-colored alyssums , the carpet of baby blue-eyes , and the ether flowers that she wanted in the garden , Mr. De Mille worked at a lahle at the other end of the long room , ignoring our conversation . In fact , we would never have known that he heard a word of ours , except that some admirer sent over a basket in which there were two little bull pups with the toughest mugs I had ever seen . De Mille was tickled with the gift . He interrupted us . " You gardeners have named flies , pups for me , " he called . " Bougainvillaea and Salpiglossis . " The names stuck , too , except that as the pups grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names too effete for such tough mugs , and they degenerated into Buggy and Sloppy . While we planted to make the De Mille Hollywood garden thoroughly feminine in its color scheme , some of my crew moved up into the mountains to turn Paradise into a man 's estate . Up there , De mile wanted splashes of all kinds of color- " anything that 's barbaric , " as he put it-and not a dumesticated plant was used . While this , was going on . Mrs. De Mille decided that perhaps there ought to he a touch of the barbaric nearer home . As a concession , she bad me plant , inside a hedge of white climbing roses that shut it off from the main garden , an inner sanctum of blood-red roses . Inside this pergola , De Mille smoked his pipe and played with Buggy and Sloppy . Seldom does a landscape architect have the privilege of creating the same estate twice . But De Mile 's mountain Paradise had hardly been finished when a terrific chaparral fire swept over the mountains , devastating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us back to restore the great natural park . Where one pine tree had grown before , he ordered us to move in a whole grove , and where one acre of native wild flowers had burst in riotous glory , he wanted two acres sown . Like most movie stars with country places , the De Miles had many guests for week ends . De Mille found it hard to concentrate when he was wrestling with an idea , and that , too , became a problem for a landscaper to work out . We solved it by means of a secret trail , taking off from behind some shrubs , to a pergola on a crag , which was kept stocked with crackers and cheese , a few bottles of beer , an olle of cold water , and plenty of smoking tobacco . When he came to the shrubbery , De Mile looked about to make sure nobody was looking , hastily pulled the branches aside and stepped through them into a world all his own . One of the things you soon learn in landscaping is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some have a weakness for green , or red , or yellow . Generally , women are more conscious of color combinations than men , who say , " Look at the way Nature mixes up the colors . " I 've never known Nature to mix clashing colors , but most men think she does . A landscaper has to be something of a doctor when he plans colors . People with depressed spirits have to be surrounded with gay colors . If they are excitable , blues , greens and purples soothe them . The trick is to fit the garden to the personality . Often there is n't mu . b leeway . Ruth Chatterton , for instance , demanded a garden that was different , and all in white , with no other colors than the green foliage . Iler home was on a large city lot about two hundred feet square . In addition to white , she demanded great fragrance , which was fortunate . White flowers generally are the most fragrant , since they lack bright colors to attract the insects that pollinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg people to plant white flowers , only to have them refuse , saying , " White is too funereal . " Today we send the gay-colored flowers to funerals and use white in our gardens . For background in Miss Chattorton 's garden , we used white-trunked birches , white climbing roses , and sizable bushes of mystery gardenias . One fence we covered with white Confederate jasmines , alternating with the Spanish . In the foregrounds were white daffodils , agapanthns , eallas , geraniums , carnations , begonias , hyacinths , tuberous spider lilies , perennial phlox and even white fuchsias . I scoured the countryside , driving four hundred miles one way , two hundred another , to find white heliotropes and Swainsonas , and Miss Chatterton supplied the final touch  --  six cyclonic snow-white cairn terriers . I had always wanted to do an a  --  hile garden arid , as a stunt , it was a great success . Its fragrance was so overwhelming that it could be caught a block away by people driving by . At night , the white garden was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only that but the perfumes of the white nicotiana and the night-scented jasmine lure beautiful white moths to the blossoms . By moonlight , a white garden is a dream . But when Miss Chat tertou was away on a trip and leased her place for a year , her tenants became so uneasy in the white garden that they slipped in colored pottery and planted colored perennials everywhere . I learned my lesson . Never again , except as a client demanded it , would I plan an all-white garden , except . for corners , nooks or sections of gardens abounding elsewhere in color . Nor an all-red garden , either , for that matter . Mrs. Leslie Carter , who spent her last clays in retirement in a flollaavood garden , insisted that I use flowers that blossomed in the unusual shade of her hair . an orange red , or red orange  --  I do n't know exactly which , but it was about the color of a persimmon . " It is the only color , " she explained , " with which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not find flowers just that shade . I was about to give it up as an impossible job when I happened to pass a city park aglow with rare Patinae of just the right shade . Partly by fair means and partly by foul , I managed to secure one hundred roots of the canvas , and the tragedienne was able to vibrate to her last days in an orange-red garden , which one entered through a white gate with a moss-green roof which , to everyone 's amazement , she wanted repainted blood-red . When I refused to condone the atrocity , she summoned painters one Sunday morning and had the outrage committed under her personal direction , and blood-red the gate remained to her last vibration . It is nothing short of astounding what can be clone with plants to make a garden look like what . it is n't , wider or shorter , or what will you . In San Marino . the garden of William Mead Om was carved out of an orange grove , which made the plot too long and narrow for beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side , I changed the proportions so definitely that it was hard to believe that flowers could alter the looks of a piece of real estate so much . The job was just the reverse when Loretta Young bought a lot in Bel Air , which was , incidentally , a ritzy tract from which movie folk were barred when it was laid out . Now it is a beauty spot to which they are wooed . But this star 's lot lacked depth , and she wanted me to make it look long , and give her privacy on one of the busiest streets of the city , Wilshire Boulevard . So I hid her house behind a high hedge of mermaid roses , pale yellow , with the most lustrous foliage of the rose family , and used cool colors to stretch out the lot . It is possible to matte gardens seem warm or cool , by the choice of colors . For winter gardens we use the warming colors , yellow , orange , red , . salmon ; and any garden planted to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer gardens , blues , lavenders , the gentler pinks , the whites and greens will make the garden seem cooler , even in midsummer . The warming colors , it so happens , are the advancing colors . They make the garden seem smaller . The cooling colors are the receding- colors . They make it seem large . Could there be any cheaper , easier way to acquire real estate ? The finest experiment I ever carried out with color was at Arcady , the hilltop estate of George Owen Knapp , at Santa Barbara . Carleton Monroe Winslow , the architect , took me up there to create a series of formal Italian gardens in color , to fit the walls , the stairs , the balustrades , and the fountains and pavilion of stone which Mr. Winslow had designed . Both Mr. Knapp and his wife were devotees of color and they wanted a series of gardens so designed that they and their friends could walk from one splash of color to the next . So we began with the yellowarid-orange garden . We festooned yellow roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . We used lion's-tail , canary-yellow lull flowers , yellow and brown irises along paths of tan-colored stone . Then , to give the yellows and orange a punch , we planted brown wallflowers , African marigolds , brown irises and chrysanthemums , and , for the final accent , deep red roses , almost . black . We had just finished bringing this garden into flower when Mr. Knapp brought his friend , Erbil Root , through it . " Knapp , you ca n't call this just a yellow garden , " exclaimed Mr. Root . " It 's the garden of the sun . " Winch it was , in all truth , and as different from the next in the series as day is from night . Going up a stone stairs , as a toil , to a higher level , one came to a garden all in green . There were no flowers in it at all , only eucalyptus trees , beds carpeted with evergreen African grape , flagstone paths lined with slipped dwarf-boxwood hedges . On the opposite side , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance , there stood is series of Italian strawberry jars , four feet high . The only color in that whole garden was the red of the strawberries dangling from the jars . From there , one walked down into the blue-green garden , wills grass paths edged by blue irises , past beds of blue gem nemesia ? the walls covered with blue wistaria , rand climbing blue-purple heliotrope . Next . we came to the rose garden , still lower , in all the riot of colors that the queen of flowers can offer . But each garden emphasized a color note , which is the secret of good ghost gardening . A garden doctor meets people of many minds . Some of their ideas are merely funny , and some are villainous . There was the woman who debated for three years about buying an extra lot for an additional garden , then bought . it and peremptorily ordered the garden completed in time for a party two weeks later . There was the rock-garden lover who wanted her desert garden of parched rock , sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotus and water lilies , fringed with papyrus from the shallow 's of the Nile . There was the man who wanted water to Ilow up a slope and burble in a spring from the top of the hill . He has it , too , with the aid of a little electric pump at the foot of the streamlet , which lifts the same water over the same c'irc'uit a dozen times a day . Out of a clear sky one day came letter asking me to come to San Luis Obispo and meet Miss Julia Morgan . She turned out to be a. prim , wrinkled , vigorous little old lady with heavy horn-rimmed glasses . Later I learned that she had been taken to Paris as a girl by Mrs. Phoebe Hearst to study and be a companion for Mrs. Hearst 's boy , William . As time went . on , William found other companions and Miss Morgan became a distinguished architect . Among her famous jobs is the baronial Hearst castle , rising like a Maxfield Parrish dream out of the Santa Lucia Mountains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch . Everything he can see from his castle Mr. Hearst owns , except the Pacific Ocean . " Mr. Hearst read in a gardening magazine about your work with natives on Rancho La Brea , " began Miss Morgan . " He would like to have you study his gardens and offer some suggestions . " TwelueiThousancl  --  Dollar Whiff The Sultan of San Simeon was away at ' the time , but one of San Simeon 's thirty-five ears was waiting , and we rode up to study the landscaping problem . Just to look over the Hearst empire was a task in itself . The road from the front gate to the castle was six miles long . It was filly-five miles to the back gate . Mr. Hearst wanted the roadsides forested , and we had to find trees that the giraffes , the gnus and the gazelles , not to mention the other exotic animals that roamed the estate , would not eat . He wanted whole mountainsides planted to native flowers : He wanted things done on such a magnificent scale that it called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardening staff , just to keep the various projects moving . Fortunately , neither Mr. Hearst nor anyone else ever asked what it would cost to execute any idea or whim . Once , I remember , he chanced to smell a daphne in blossom on one of his trips , and immediately telegraphed his head gardener to plant a ring of daphne bushes around the palace . It was a long way around the palace , and it took just about all the daphnes the gardener could find in all the nurseries of California to complete the job . That chance whiff of daphne scent set Mr. Hearst back about twelve thousand dollars T Before I left San Simeon on that first visit , I was sent to the studio to be " mugged . " Everybody who comes to the place must be photographed , and Mr. Hearst keeps a photographer on duty all the time . Every pass has the possessor 's picture on it , and without one of these passports you can not enter the portals of the San Simeon empire . So many people come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know them all . Hence , the guard carefully scrutinizes your picture when you present your pass , which you must do whenever challenged . My first encounter with the lord of the castle was when he sent for me to tell what I would do if turned loose in his gardens . It was in April . and scores of movie folk were arriving for his annual birthday party , at which time Mr. Hearst falls off the water wagon to the extent of joining his well-wishers in one toast , in champagne . It is his one drink of the year . While people gathered from the hundred guest rooms , we sat in the enormous living room looking out the great window at the hills , which were veritable sheets of wild flowers . But Mr. Hearst wanted still more of them . He wanted to know if I appreciated and loved the native plants . I assured him I did . " Are you sure we are on the right track ? " he asked in his little , squeaky Yoke , SO astonishing coming from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure we are , " I said . " All right . Go ahead . " That was about . the extent of my orders , except when he had a sudden inspiration . His memory was prodigious , even when long ' botanical names were mentioned in casual conversation . Once he called me to inquire about a hush I had planted near the castle . " Mr. Adams , what 's this shrub ? I like it very much . " " That 's pittosporum undulatum , " I replied . Nothing more was said about the name , which is partly Greek and partly Latin for " pitehJike seeds with wavy leaves , " but several weeks later , when I encountered Mr. Hearst . he said : " Mr. Adams , I like that pittosporum undulatum very much . We ought to plant more of them , " All together , we brought in about thirty thousand trees , many of them full grown , and planted them along the roads and about the grounds . If Mr. Hearst did not like an oak where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of the cost , and without interfering with its growth . Once he spent ten thousand dollars moving two six-hundred-year-old live oaks thirty feet . It seemed to me he knew every tree on the place , and that he saw most of them every day . " Did you notice the scarlet eucalyptus this morning ? " he would ask . Or it might be the Chinese flowering peach , or the South American jacaranda . Everywhere , around the grounds , were telephones in metal boxes hidden under bushes or behind slabs of stone , so that he could call one of his editors long distance any time an idea struck him . These phones were always identified by the nearest tree . " There 's a call for you under the African wedding tree , " an attendant would say . Mr. Hearst . would reach under the leaves and begin talking to New York . Everybody catered to his whims , except my gang of tree and flower planters . To them , he was just another rich man , and I could never get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . who was one of my best . workers , but a tough young man , came up the road with a steaming truckload of manure just in time to meet Mr. Hearst , with a party of thirty guests on horseback , taking an early-morning ride . The truck and the horseback party met at a narrow turn , flanked by a steep bank . Anybody else would have stopped , but Glenn had to deliver his load right then . He honked and kept on coming , while the whole party scrambled like mountain goats up the steep hank . We packed our bags for quick departure . But Mr. Hearst said no word . It is one of the laws of San Simeon that death must never be discussed . If a tree dies Mr. Hearst never mentions it , and nobody says anything about it to him either . The tree is just removed when he is n't around . One of our plantings included one hundred stately Washingtonia , palms , which we moved more than two hundred miles . Out of the number , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large party of guests . There was no time to remove it without leaving an unsightly sear in the landscape , yet we knew he would be distressed to look out the window at a dead palm . We were in a bad spot . solved the dilemma , not by landscape architecture but by art . One of the boys raced forty miles down to town for a can of olive-green paint , which he put in a spray gun , then climbed a tall ladder and coated the dying leaves green . Mr. Hearst never noticed the palm , and its death was never mentioned until he left for another trip and it could be removed without his seeing it . A sign that hits the visitor in the eye , right after he enters the gates , reads : THE ANIMALS HAVE THE RIGHT OF WAY ALWAYS , This , too , is the law of San Simeon . Along the six-mile drive from the seaside to the summit , you ride past herds of antelope and pa zelles , sacred white deer of China , gnus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kangaroos , llamas and giraffes  --  in short , virtually the whole animal kingdom , living contentedly in the natural state on the grassy slopes . This is delightful for Mr. Hearst . and his guests , but not for the landscaper . The Battle of the Century Plants When we tried , for instance , to transplant the century plants that Mr. Hearst wanted , a strange feud broke out between them and the nilg , a1 antelope from India . Just why , I do n't know , but the antelope took offense at the great clamps of plants we brought from the Mexican border and acclimated on the hillsides . Evidently cut by the sharp thorns , they thought the century plants had attacked them . The animals shredded the plants with their horns , until we set guards over the plantings . Then they came at night and finished the destruction , even to digging out the roots with their sharp hoofs . It seemed to me that , whether Mr. Hearst was home or not , there were never fewer than thirty guests , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great dining room . There were horses for all who wanted to ride , and for those who came unprepared the valet kept several dozen riding habits in all sizes . All a guest had to do was step into the wardrobe room and be measured . Most of the guests were Hollywood folk , many of whom I had known by way of the garden . So I was usually regarded as a guest when I arrived to inspect the work of my crew of planters . This sometimes led to strange mix-ups . Turning up one day simultaneously with a large party from Hollywood , I was shown to my room , only to find a charming lady sitting on the bed , at the foot of which sat my traveling bag and a woman 's hag and hat box . She looked up in surprise . " Really , this is my room , " she said , with a delightful English accent . " Who are you and why are you in here ? " " My name is Adams and I 'm a landscape architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here and checked my name off the list . I 'm sure it can he straightened out , " " Attend , we must be quick , " she countered . " My husband is on the way up . He is jealous and will be annoyed . Do just as I tell you . The minute he comes in the door , ask him ir he 's ever seen the blue jacarauda tree in bloom . Exclaim that it 's the loveliest thing on earth . He 'll be all smiles at once . " Just then her husband came in the door . I did exactly as told . The scowl on Mr. P. G. Wodehouse 's face turned to a smile . I 've always said that a blue jacaranda tree saved my hide . ( Cant4noted from Page 78 ) life began , like the world around her , to put out a few timid green feathers , The university throbbed with life and youth . Everyone began to wear bright clothes , the professors showed a new zest . Commons was crowded , and Judith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people she knew , how many friends she had made . She saw Mark all the time now . They walked hack and forth from class together , sat on the library steps in the spring sunshine and talked . One day Toni stopped Judith and walked to the Hall with her . He asked her for a date ! Judith 's heart turned to water in her breast . She ought to refuse him . She really ought . But she could not do it . He asked her to their spring dance . She had gone to the Omega spring dance last year with Tom when he was being rushed . Judith said she would go . She wondered , climbing the stairs , if Marjory had given him the runaround , now that she was initiated . Heidi told her that Marjory was dating a senior  --  had a. pin ! Well , Marjory had said frankly that she was looking for a husband . When Judith saw Marjory she wished her luck , and Marjory said she was pretty pleased about it all herself .

If it pleases her , it 's all right with me . But Bill rates things pretty honestly . I want you to know him , Judith . " Judith felt differently now about . going to the Omega dance with Tom . She wished she had said she would n't go . And then Mark complicated things by asking her to go to the independent men 's dance in North Hall the same night . " I 've got a date , but I 'll see if I can break it , " she said . She would too ! After all , Mark had asked her to go about when Tom was busy elsewhere .

They always chose an independent . girl as vice president of the sophomore class , and she wanted that . And could have it , too , she felt . And if her grades held up and she were elected as a junior officer in her Hall , she would he on Student Council . The drift of her life , the good things that lay within her reach , had nothing to do with Tom . Murk and his friends were the ones she liked and could depend upon .

When was she going to grow up ? Firmly she picked up the telephone . Firmly she made her choice and called Tom and broke her date with him . She . had not reached her room before she was called hack to the telephone . Tom 's voice , loud and angry , filled the booth , vibrated in her ear : " You broke a date with me and I just want the pleasure of hanging up on you ! " And " bang ! " went the telephone receiver .

What a sap she had been ! She had even been pleased at Adelaide 's tact less loyalty . " Boy , but am I a sucker , " she told herself . But Adelaide was full of talk , and Judith was polite to her . " So dad says I can use the car and I 'm on the Rush Committee ! We go around this summer and call on all these prospects . to see what , kind of homes they have , and then we recommend them or not . " " Swell , " said Judith . " I suppose they 'll all be just holding their breath until you look them over . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said to Judith : " Sonic of it would surprise you , Judith . It did me . Do you know one thing we have to do ? Every place we go we have to make an excuse to go to the bathroom , so we can see it . The girls say the bathroom tells you more about the family life and whether a girl is suitable or not than any other thing ! It sounds kind of silly to me. but then I 've never rushed before . " Suddenly Judith gave a shout of laughter . Such a laugh came up from her very insides that she shook with it . She laughed until she cried . Long after Adelaide had gone , puzzled and offended , Judith was still laughing . She could not quit . Oh , it was wonderful ! It was simply too precious for words . It was the most marvelous thing in the world . SererOies , she thought. , and she was weak with mirth . Judith went back down to the telephone . She called Mark , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again . " What 's the matter with yon , you nut ! " said Mark , and he laughed too . " Oh . I can never tell you . But , oh , Mark , come to Goon Castle and get me , and let 's go and get a soda or something . I 've just had a wonderful present . I 've just got my citizenship papers . Oh , honey , come a-running , because I 'm myself again . I 'm Judith now , and you never knew me before ! "
