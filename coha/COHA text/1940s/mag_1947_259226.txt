While he was flying 75 bombardment missions over Europe in World War II , 23-year-old Army Air Forces Pilot Roy Clark rose to the rank of major . But with peace , he faced reduction to first lieutenant in the Regular Army . <P> Major Clark decided on a different way of becoming a career officer . He resigned and got an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy-which had extended the entrance age from 22 to 24 for veterans of World War II . Last week , in West Point greys , ex-Major Clark was studying hard in the hope of emerging in 1950 as a shiny new second lieutenant . <P> He was not alone . While most of West Point 's 1,200 ex-servicemen ( total enrollment : 2,000 ) came from the ranks , 67 other cadets had also served as officers , in either the Army , Navy , Coast Guard or Marine Corps . Among them were two captains , 17 first lieutenants , 44 second lieutenants and four ensigns . Like ex-Major Clark , almost all had missed a college education , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eventually further their careers . <P> They had surrendered not only rank , but swank . Like all West Point fourth-classmen , they answered to titles like " Mister Dumbjohn " and endured upper-classmen 's humor . But as soldiers , most wore their ribbons . They were the gaudiest plebes in the Academy 's history . On his grey dress coat , Cadet Clark sported pilot 's wings , the Distinguished Flying Cross , the Air Medal with 13 clusters , and an ETO ribbon with six stars .
