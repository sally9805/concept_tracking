WIEDERLIGHT.C.C.A.ISAAC J .... rg. 23 Letters to The Times Open Covenants Are Urged Secret Sessions of Peace Conference Viewed as Bar to Confidence TO THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK TIMES : In your issue of March 30 , Anne O'Hare McCormick wrote what was surely a moderately stated , reasonable and thoroughly convincing r ? sum ? of the advantages , not to say the necessity , of open diplomacy in the world today . It is doubly alarming , therefore , that her column should have ended on a note of seeming acceptance that the big powers ' plan to hold the sessions of the May peace conference in Paris in secret will be so carried out . Let us meet this fact squarely : if the peace settlements are made in secret , we face possible disaster . To begin with , we approach the European peace settlements under an already grave handicap in that the three major powers will be the determining forces . It is a psychological fact that power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of guarding against calamitous results would be to provide an explicit means whereby the suggestions and proposals of the smaller nations would not only . be " considered " but would be used as determining factors in the settlements reached . We might then hope to effect that greater objectivity and equity of approach without which it is difficult to see how we can obtain a chance for lasting peace . If , however , we have to face the fact that , whether we like it or not , the settlements shall be made by the United States , Britain and Russia alone , then the least that we can demand is that those settlements be made openly , that the conclusions , if not the whole of the deliberations , be laid before the bar of world opinion before they pass into the realm of fixed settlements . At least so far as the American people are concerned , can there be any doubt on this point ? At this peace conference agreements will be made , commitments given : how can we tolerate that these agreements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once officially given , must be kept . All the more , then , is it abhorrent that we should be held responsible for pledges given by our Government without our knowledge or consent . Have we so quickly forgotten the secrecy of Versailles and the disaster to which it ultimately led ? VICTORIA KUHN . Washington , April 3 , 1946 . Jewish Sufferers Need Aid Example of Philanthropists Cited in Plea for Funds To THE EDITOR QF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Following the first World Wax , the noble generosity of one Jew , the late Julius Rosenwald , so stirred the imagination of Jews everywhere that American Jewry was able to go to the rescue of the suffering Jews of Europe in a manner both ? heroic and inspiring . It was on March 4 , 1917 , at 11:47 P. M. , to be precise , that in my capacity as director of the American Jewish Committee I appealed to Mr. Rosenwald and asked him to contribute $1,000,000 toward the projected campaign for $10,000,000 . This he readily agreed to do . His response was thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selflessness of the man . The gift , he said , was being made in the hope that the urgency of the situation would be brought home to the Jews of the United States . His offer evoked a message from Woodrow Wilson in which the President uttered sentiments as true today as they were then : " It is to America that these starving millions look for aid , and out of our prosperity , fruit of free institutions , should spring a vast and ennobling generosity . Your gift lays an obligation even while it furnishes inspiration . " Mr. Rosenwald 's generosity stirred the conscience of his fellow-Jews throughout the country . In virtually every Jewish community there was someone who , emulating the example of Julius Rosenwald , offered to contribute 10 per cent of the amount to be subscribed by his fellow-citizens . The ten million dollars was oversubscribed by nearly eleven hundred thousand dollars , of which one million dollars was contributed at my suggestion to the Jewish Welfare Board , The following year fifteen millions was raised by the American Jewish Relief Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chairman . This story has its own significance today . If the condition of the Jews in Europe was tragic in 1918 , it is infinitely more tragic today . If $25,000,000 was needed in 1917-18 , the quota of $100,000,000 set by the three great agencies  --  the Joint Distribution Committee , the United Palestine Appeal and the National Refugee Committee ? is indeed a modest one . True to the noble example set by their father , four of the children of the late Julius Rosenwald have just contributed $1,000,000 to this great cause . The family of Felix M. Warburg has given $500,000 , the family of Edmund I. Kaufmann $250,000 , and John D. Rockefeller gave $100,000 . But these gifts , generous as they are , are only a beginning . Throughout the length and breadth of the United States the conscience and the hearts of Jews and non-Jews must be stirred once More , to the end that we must alleviate at least in part ' the sufferings of uncounted hundreds of thousands of Jews in Europe upon whom has been visited such tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , April 1 , 1946 . Shorter Traffic Light Changes To THE EDITOR OP THE NEW Yonx TIMES : Although an over-sill lengthening of the east-west green lights would probably not be justified for most traffic volume , it seems to me that if the interval on designated express streets changed just twice as often as the rest of the lights , a great increase-in speed in crosstown traffic would be realized , and yet the north-south avenue traffic scarcely interrupted at all . If every important crosstown street had lights which were red against the motorist for only a half-minute , a considerable saving in time would result and these streets , and whatever others might prove feasible , would funnel most of the crosstown traffic and speed it up perhaps by 30 per cent . However , inasmuch as they are so widely spaced , the slowing of the north-south avenue traffic would be scarcely noticed . Further reduction in parking allocations and privileges is of course essential if automobiles are expected to move as fast as carriages forty years ago , but even under the existing pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.

City Salary Plan Criticized Budget Proposals Are Held Inequitable as Regards Lower Grades To THE EDITOR 08 ' THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial " Civil Service in the City " is doubly interesting if viewed in light of the proposed budget submitted by Mayor O'Dwyer . Perusal of the budget will show that the salaries do not approach even at minimum rates those of the State or Federal civil service employe . Nor do the cost-of-living bonuses approach those granted by the State to its employes on a percentage basis , thus benefiting the poorly - paid worker more than the well-paid worker . In the Mayor 's budget the police and firemen benefit more than Grade 2 or Grade 3 clerks who have not been favored . The firemen and police are the beneficiaries of a $500 raise in salary on top of a $3,000 base , while the Grade 2 and 3 clerks still get along on base salaries of $1,200 and $1,800 , plus a bonus of $240 if they have just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reached the maximums of their grades . Not only do they get less in bonus money , but the bonus itself is inequitable . An overhauling of the entire civil service salary system is important . The Governor has agreed to a study of the State system . The time is now ripe for the same thing in the city system , with a suggested moratorium on appointments until the study ig completed . A study of those granted adjustments in salaries Will show that they are in the brackets above $2,000 . How about those under $2,000 ? F. WIEDERLIGH T. Brooklyn , April 3 , 1946 . The Late Edward B. Sheldon To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : To be stricken in the prime of one 's life with paralysis and blindness would seem enough to overwhelm the stoutest heart . Not so with Ned Sheldon . With high courage he rose supreme above his afflictions , and many friends of his thanked God for his unconquerable soul . Always keenly interested in world events and in the lives ' of others , his comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , one came away not depressed with his infirmities but positively lifted and inspired by his fortitude . He had the rare faculty of friendship so that one was drawn out by him to speak with great frankness and intimacy . Many will mourn but will also be thankful for the privilege of having known him . " So he passed over , and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side . " C. C. A. New York , April 3 , 1946 . Churchillian " Me " Defended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Winston Churchill 's " This is me " calls to mind a class in comparative philology under Dr. Childs at the University of Pennsylvania in 1931 . The venerable professor declared that the use of " me " was imported to England from France , where " C'est moi " is familiar and acceptable . " Moi , " as the " emphatic form of the nominative , " in Dr. Childs ' words , was readily picked up by the English as sensible and convenient some centuries ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit off when he says : " Men like Churchill and not rules make the English language . " This time Churchill was following an accepted practice which has confused the near-literates and high school grammarians . ISAAC J. KUNIK . New York , April 1 , 1946.
