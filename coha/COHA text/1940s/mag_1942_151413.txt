General Adolphe Eugene Marie Sic ( pronounced See-say ) , High Commissioner of Free French Africa , stopped off in Manhattan on his way to London last week and received encomiums on his stout work in freeing French Equatorial Africa from the rule of Vichy . Earlier stout work by the General was not so much in the news . But it was flies-specifically the tsetse fly-from which General Sic had first set his black people free . <P> Tall , rugged General Sic , a doctor before he was a soldier , was for many years head of the Pasteur Institute at Brazzaville . Public Enemy No. 1 when General Sic took up his duties was the deadly tsetse fly , which carries the parasites causing African sleeping sickness . <P> The tsetse looks something like an ordinary housefly , but has the sharp proboscis and the bloodthirsty habits of a mosquito . When an infected tsetse bites a man , it injects into his bloodstream protozoa known as trypanosomes , which-for the tsetse is omnivampiverous-it may have picked up from the blood of alligators , hippopotamuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lymph stream , the spleen , finally the brain . At first , tsetse victims become feverish , develop swollen lymph glands . Gradually they fall into a deep slumber , grow delirious as the trypanosomes attack the nervous system and brain . Many of these sleeping sick men live for years before they waste away and die . <P> There is no vaccine against sleeping sickness , but the powerful arsenic drug tryparsamide , which kills syphilis spirochetes , also kills the trypanosomes of sleeping sickness . Developed in the Rockefeller Institute in 1919 , and introduced to Africa by Dr. Louise Pearce in the ' 20s , tryparsamide clears up sleeping sickness in three to six months when injected twice a week . General Sic 's biggest job was persuading the natives to take the treatment . He also organized fly-killing squads . With this curative and preventive program , in 17 years General Sic brought down the sleeping-sickness toll from 2,000,000 victims , or about 80% of the native population in one-third of French Equatorial Africa , to less than 1% . <P> When France fell to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies to fight . He planned a successful uprising against the Vichyites entrenched in Middle Congo . When the Governor General refused to go along with the Free French , General Sic and aides wrapped him in a blanket , threw him in a truck , dumped him over the border into the Belgian Congo .
