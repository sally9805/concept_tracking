txt Present methods of administrating the priorities system in defense operations threaten to disrupt the tank-building program around which the Army has built its plans for development of mechanization . A $20,000,000 tank factory on the outskirts of Detroit , designed to produce 1,000 twenty-five-ton tanks a year , will be completed , as far as construction is concerned , by April 1 . Delays encountered in obtaining delivery on machinery , however , raise a question whether tanks will be rolling out of the factory by early Fall . Most of the essential machinery was ordered in August . About onethird of it has been delivered . Civilian and Army officials here think that another third will come in on schedule , but they are most uncertain about the final third . All the machinery must be on hand before production can start , else there can be no assembly-line operation at all . That is the current report on one major defense operation intended to demonstrate the efficient manner in which civilian industry could be geared to the defense program . Solution of the problem apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPM , recently reconstituted with E. R. Stettinius I Jr. , at its head , in association with the Munitions Boards of the Army and Navy . The men responsible for the tank program , with whom this correspondent surveyed that operation , are disappointed but not critical of the program . They feel that if the tank program must be deferred in the face of greater need for airplanes and naval vessels , there is no alternative . But they hope a way can yet be devised to carry out this program on schedule . The Chrysler tank arsenal is one of the extraordinary ventures of the rearmament program . It came into being after a telephone call last Summer in which William S. Knudsen , Director General of OPM , asked his old friend , K. T. Keller , president of the Chrysler Corporation , if his company could make tanks for the Army . Mr. Keller said " yes , " and within a few days a contract was signed whereby the Chrysler company agreed to build a factory for the ; government and then operate it under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract was signed Aug. 15 . Dm ing the last week-end this correspondent was able to survey progress on the venture with the cooperation of Mr. Keller , E. J. Hunt , Master mechanic for the Chrysler Corporation . and three Army officers . These were Lieut . Col. H. W. Rehm , commanding officer of the arsenal ; Major H. B. Kadlec , construction quartermaster , and Lieut . Col. A. B. Ginsburgh , of the office of the Under-Secretary of War , Robert P. Patterson . Competition for Took An inspection trip showed how a great new industry is being constructed " from scratch , " while conversations - incipally exemplified the confusion that exists regarding priorities in the machine-tool industry . It was quite evident that the heart of the priorities problem lies in competition between the armed services , for in this case , at least , competition by private industry for machine tools appeared to be entirely outside the picture . The tank arsenal is a collaborative job , in which the government pays the bills for construction and equipment while the Chrysler Corporation supplies plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in which the company is scheduled to build 1.000 tanks for $$33,500,000 , it will recoup its expenses . After . that year the government will own the arsenal outright and may lease it out again if it desires , or operate the plant itself . Supervision of the operation is in the hands of Brig . Gen. H. Campbell of the Ordnance Division . The tank arsenal consists at this stage of a building 1.380 feet long and 500 feet wide , %. which is virtually weather-tight behind steel and glass walls , and Is one-third complete in its interior . Various machine tools are being placed on preconstructed foundations and some Materials are being shipped into it . The plant consists as yet , however , mostly of plans , procedures and working operations , which can take form only with full delivery of tools . " The machines were not ordered just to have them handy around the house . " Mr. Hunt said . " Every one fits into the plan . " S250,000 Spent on Plans To illustrate his meaning he flicked the pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book which represents actual expenditure of 8250,000 on plans . In its pages are defined in detail the procedure , the labor and the tools required to make every stamping in the new tanks and every operation in their assembly . The book had to be completed before foundations were laid for the building . On a large table in a wing of the Dodge factory Mr. Hunt has his plant laid down in miniature on a table forty feet long . The book and the table represent the combined efforts of twenty tool engineers , 200 tool designers and some 250 others . This preliminary work was required largely by the fact that changes in plans after the contract was signed evolved an entirely new tank . When Mr. Keller signed the contract to produce the plant and tanks he received a set of blueprints for experimental tanks produced at the Rock Island Arsenal in relatively small quantities . By the time military experts finished their revisions the tanks were much larger and acquired arms and armament never before used in this country . Production plans now call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven men and powered by a 400-horsepower Wright airplane engine . Equipped with these engines , and with guns manufactured by the government , the tanks eventually will roll out of this arsenal prepared to start firing with a 75-mm. cannon , a 37-mm. cannon , a 30-mm. antiaircraft gun and a nest of machine guns . They will supply the principal force of the Army 's armored Corps when they are built . In the meantime a specially selected crew , working in one section of the plant , is rushing to completion two hand-built tanks known as pattern models . Parts have been contrived for these tanks and their motors are ready and waiting . Progress of Program to Date Aside from worry over the future delivery of equipment , the tank arsenal has proceeded on schedule . These are the highlights of the pro-gram : Aug. ** signed . Sept. ** broken for the building . Sept. ** production plans advanced to point where construction steel was ordered from Bethlehem Steel Corporation . Oct. ** construction contract let to 0 . W. Burke Company of Detroit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , Jan. ** erection completed . Feb. ** force moved into completed section of the building . The tank arsenal represents an unprecedented job of planning and construction within a single unit . Mr. Keller compared it with a plant of sufficient size to turn out 1,000 Plymouth automobiles a day . There are many larger automobile factories , but these have grown by evolution , and have been based on vast experience in building automobiles . Mr. Hunt , as operating manager of the arsenal , created this plant on paper in cooperation with Lieut . Col. Rehm in what may easily be a record task of Imaginative planning . The arsenal is designed for continuous production on a horseshoe pattern . Into one long side run railway tracks to carry the materials as they are needed  --  the castings and forgings for heavier pieces , such as 3,000-pound single 1piece tank turrets , armor plate and guns . These trains will unload material beside the finishing and stamping machines . When parts are finished they will be moved to the assembly line on the opposite side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Detour to Proving Ground There will be one detour , when each tank is taken from the assembly line to an adjoining proving ground for a seventy-five-mile test run over all types of terrain , and its , guns are fired . Then it will be rechecked and sent on to the Army . This simple procedure involves 11,000 large and heavy machines , some 8,000 gauges and fixtures and many thousands of tools , to be used by from 5,000 to 6,000 workmen . Every machine , gauge and tool had to be planned in advance and either specially constructed or fitted with special equipment . When Mr. Hunt was asked if he could adapt second-hand machine tools in some of the work he replied : " If you use second-hand machines you will have to re-tool the whole works . " For the handling of materials and tanks the plant has two forty-ton cranes and several ten-ton ones . 1Many of the large boring mills , on order but not delivered , weigh twenty-three tons each . Much of the machinery required in this operation is so large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was explained that such clearances are ( necessary for the machines that I even the automobile plants themselves are not usable . Most of this machinery was ordered in August , but in one way or another other operators on government contracts appear to have taken over much of it . This is a subject that Mr. Keller and Mr. Hunt touch on with reticence , but as a result of uncertainty over delivery of equipment the Chrysler plant now faces a problem in the training of the labor force to man the plant . Mr. Hunt estimates that trained automobile workers will have some familiarity with 60 per cent of the operations involved , while workers for the remaining 40 per cent must be trained " from scratch . " It appears doubtful , however , whether with all the defense activities developing in the Detroit area a 60 per cent trained crew will be available . On the basis of that possibility , Mr. Hunt has further reduced his calculations to estimate that he can train or schedule a crew of workers , if he can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is not as much worry about labor supply as about the maI chines for the men to use . Labor can be improvised , hut there is no compromise between having a vital machine tool and not having it .
