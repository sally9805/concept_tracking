General Joseph W. Stilwell , U.S. hero of the retreat from Burma and sometime chief of staff to Chiang Kaishek , got a new job last week after nearly three months of idleness . Uncle Joe was made chief of the Army Ground Forces . <P> Ground soldiers generally applauded the appointment of good infantryman Stilwell to a post that puts him in charge of training all U.S. Army fighting men except air crews . Uncle Joe learned about modern , fighting the hard way ; next to General MacArthur , he has campaigned longer than any other top-ranking ground commander in this war . <P> The man he succeeds is solemn , starched , 65-year-old Lieut . General Ben Lear . Before the war Ben Lear was a good training officer , made national headlines by marching the rowdy spirits out of a battalion of trainees who went too far in yoo-hooing at girls on a Memphis golf links-where the General happened to be golfing . Lear 's new assignment : Deputy Commander to General Ike Eisenhower . <P> As General Ike 's deputy , General Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to pass " the word " down through the command . Many soldiers were beginning to think it was about time : there were 18,000 AWOLs in ETO last week . Ben Lear will have no part in General Lee 's second job : " Courthouse " will go on being boss of supply and service forces .
