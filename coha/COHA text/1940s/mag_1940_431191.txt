IN 1540 , just 400 years ago , Francisco Vasquez de Coronado led his band of goldhungry explorers into the rocky country near the headwaters of the Little Colorado River in what is now western New Mexico . Their imagination fired by the reports of Cabeza de Vaca and Fray Marcos de Niza , who had preceded them into the southern borders of Pueblo land , the Conquistadores were keyed to high anticipation . Had not Fray Marcos himself viewed from a distance the very city the guides said they were now approaching , and stated that it appeared even more magnificent than the rumors had indicated ? Finally the great moment arrived . From a low hilltop across the shallow valley , Coronado and his fellow Spaniards viewed the first of the Seven Cities of Cfbola , drab against a dull background of arid hills . A Crumpled Village ? and no Gold The Spaniards were not at all impressed . Says Pedro de Castaneda , chronicler of the expedition : " When they saw the first village , which was Cibola , such were the curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may protect him from them . It is a little , crowded village , looking as if it had been crumpled all up together . There are ranch houses in New Spain which make a better appearance at a distance . " The Conquistadores were in search of gold . They could not see or understand the riches of another sort which lay behind those adobe walls , the wealth of a people who had intimate acquaintance with Nature and with Mother Earth , a people to whom religion and poetry were as one . In the environment which looked so unproductive to the Spaniards , this race saw beauty and extracted it to build their arts and their ceremonies . Wealth of a material sort these Indians neither had nor seemed to care about . In the turquoise which adorned the entrances of their houses they saw the depths of clear waters and the infinite space of the sky , and thus it represented pure beauty . That it might possess value of another sort had never o curred to them . Among their possessions was little else to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pueblos to draw aloof . The religion of the white man , built around totally different concepts , scarcely penetrated the Pueblo mind , and , though he temporarily accepted many forms of Christianity , his philosophy remained his own . This , then , was the Pueblo of Hawikuh , predecessor to Zuni , in 1540 ( Color Plate III ) . Wrote Castaneda : " It is a village of about 200 warriors , is three and four stories high , with the houses small and having only a few rooms . . . . The people of the whole district had collected here . " When they refused to have peace on the terms the interpreters extended to them , but appeared defiant , the Santiago war cry was given , and they were at once put to flight . The Spaniards then attacked the village , which was taken with not a little difficulty , since they held the narrow and crooked entrance .  |p549  " During the attack they knocked the general down with a large stone , and would have killed him but for Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw themselves above him and drew him away , receiving the blows of the stones , which were not few . But the first fury of the Spaniards could not be resisted , and in less than an hour they entered the village and captured it . They discovered food there , which was the thing they were most in need of . " Coronado 's expedition was a failure , so far as its main purpose was concerned . The other fabled " cities of Cfbola " proved as disappointing as the first . No mines were discovered and no colonization resulted . Because of the expedition 's unfavorable reports , no further penetration was attempted for forty years , but eventually , in the wake of the later explorers , Spanish settlers drifted into the territory . In the face of growing colonization of the Southwest , the Pueblo Indians rebelled in 1680 and killed or drove out all the Spaniards . However , the Spanish soon reconquered the region . The Pueblos in 1696 made one more determined attempt to drive out the invaders . but after much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of further resistance as the white population increased , the Pueblos . peacefully for the most part , have continued their native manner of living to the present day ? remarkably unchanged after four centuries of white contact . The Setting , a Vast , Dramatic Land Three major chapters unfold in the study of the Southwest peoples . The prehistoric must be interpreted by archeologic research ; the period of Spanish influence begins properly about 1540 with the  |p550  Coronado expedition ; and , finally , the period of American occupation opens about the middle of the 19th century . The vast stage for the drama of these amazing people , herein called the Southwest , consists primarily of Arizona and New Mexico . It includes also southern Utah and Colorado and the northern parts of the Mexican States of Sonora and Chihuahua. * Generally speaking , the entire area is semiarid , though it is only in southwestern Arizona that true desert conditions exist . Because of its scarcity , water was highly important to the Indians . Its location determined the sites of their settlements , and prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies of the agricultural tribes ( page 566 ) . Imposing ruins , marking the sites where the prehistoric inhabitants dwelt , early caught the imagination of white travelers . The Spaniards noted many of the remains . When American occupation began , some of the ruins were mapped and first described in detail . Public interest was aroused by these descriptipns , and " cliff dwellers " became a household term . Solving the Mystery of the Cliff Dwellers Up to 1880 there was relic hunting , but no systematic excavations were made until after that date . Even in this period the digging was primarily to obtain specimens , beautiful pottery being the principal lure . Not until the present century was well under way was any serious attempt made to determine the age and periods of the ruins .  |p551  For many years the cliff dwellers were supposed to be a long-vanished race , distinct from the Indians . Some surmised that these structures might be 20 or 30 thousand years old ! Equally fantastic theories were advanced concerning the cliff-dwelling people . Some thought they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanquished by later barbarians . Some interpreted the small storage granaries as the dwelling places of dwarfs ! Thus fancy ran free until the spade of the scientific archeologist began , in comparatively recent years , to uncover for us the true prehistory of the region . We now know that the " cliff dwellers " were prehistoric Pueblo Indians who built their pueblos on cliffs for safety from hostile tribes . Knowledge concerning the area 's prehistoric sites is probably now the most comprehensive of any comparable archeologic area in the world . In the growth rings of the wooden beams of the houses , preserved in the arid climate , the investigator has a calendar which places his site more certainly than did the Romans when they carved a date in their cornerstone. * What , then , is the story of these people . now so clearly revealed to us , who lived here before Cabeza de Vaca and his companions first heard of the Seven Cities of Cfbola ? The first human occupants of the area , of whom we have definite knowledge and whose culture we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their first arrival may have been shortly after the beginning of the Christian Era . They occupied the upland territory comprising most of present-day New Mexico and Utah and the northern part of Arizona . Human Hair Used for Weaving These pioneers were a long-headed people who used the spear thrower instead of the bow and arrow , and had no knowledge of pottery making . They lived in the numerous caves of the region and probably also in brush shelters erected in the open . They manufactured coiled basketry , made fine square-toed sandals of woven cord , and twined yucca-fiber bags with colored decorations . So precious was good textile material that they hacked off their own hair for weaving . As time went on , these enterprising people either invented the art of pottery making or , more likely , learned it from their neighbors in Mexico . The decorations on this pottery were simple lines and dots with sometimes a realistic figure . Their vessels were often painted with a red pigment after firing , so that the color was not fast . In their simple agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrow made the spear thrower obsolete and displaced it as their principal weapon . Ultimately the Basket Makers learned to make circular or rectangular pit dwellings . They dug out a kind of cellar , which they lined with mud plaster or stones and roofed with a conical structure of poles covered with mats , brush , plaster , and earth . A smoke hole was  |p555  left in the center of the roof and the room was entered through a covered tunnel in the side . Living thus in an artificial cave , they were well protected from winter cold . About 500 A. D. the country of the Basket Makers was invaded by a new people . Shorter in stature , these newcomers had round heads , made even broader by the custom of lashing their infants to hard cradleboards which flattened the backs of their infantile skulls . First Families of the Pueblos These were the people we now call the Pueblos . With the Basket Makers , among whom they apparently settled , they were the ancestors of the pueblo-dwelling people living in the Southwest today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new neighbors . They wove round-toed sandals , made coiled basketry similar to that of the Basket Makers , and discovered or brought with them the use of cotton . At first they lived in circular pit houses much like those of the Basket Makers , but gradually they began to build their structures mostly above ground with thick walls of poles and plaster . Occasionally several such structures were joined in the manner of connecting rooms . In time these people started to build community structures of many rooms . Their agriculture became more intensive , their ceremonies more elaborate , and their arts more specialized and localized . For several centuries before the coming of the Spaniards this progress continued , and the period from about 1100 to 1400 A. D. marked the climax and greatest flowering of the culture . During this era the Pueblos built the great apartment dwellings like Pueblo Bonito ( Plate II ) and Chettro Kettle of Chaco Canyon , and such imposing cliff dwellings as the Cliff Palace and Spruce Tree House of Mesa Verde ( Plate XVII and page 584 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborigines north of Mexico . Just as these peaceful agriculturists were achieving their highest advance , warlike enemies appeared ? fierce nomads from the north and east . This was why the apartment dwellers built some of their pueblos on the ledges and open caves of high cliffs . Whether the raids of these hostile aliens produced a setback , or whether the natural decline that follows every period of rapid cultural development was the cause , there soon began a period of retrogression which continued until the Spaniards entered the country and produced even more profound changes . About the time the Pueblos came into the land of the Basket Makers , another people , the Hohokams , invaded from the south the semidesert region of the Gila River in southern Arizona . Like the Basket Makers , they were long-headed . These people lived in square houses of poles and brush held together by mud plaster . Their villages were surrounded by adobe mud walls . Expert farmers , the Hohokams built elaborate irrigation systems which made the desert bloom ( Plate XIX ) . Just as the prehistoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . so were the Hohokams probably ancestors of the present-day Pimas , Papagos , and other farming or rancheria tribes . The third great group of Southwest Indians consists of the nomadic tribes . Archeologic evidence of these is scant , and even during the Spanish period they form a rather shadowy background , being mentioned usually because of their enmity to the settled Pueblo peoples . Most often named in these early accounts were the Comanches , Apaches , Navajos , and Utes . Warlike exploits of the Apaches extended into fairly recent times under their chief Geronimo ( Plate I and page 554 ) . No " Vanishing Americans " Are Navajos Largest of all tribes in the United States today are the Navajos , numbering about 50,000 and occupying a huge territory in northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico ( page 585 ) . Far from being " vanishing Americans , " the Navajos are actually much more numerous now than when the Spaniards came . With the Apaches they make up more than half of the Southwest 's entire Indian population . Bodes the Navajos , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Comanches of northeastern New Mexico , who always formed a link between the Southwest peoples and the buffalo-hunting tribes of the Great Plains : the Jicarilla Apaches of northwestern New Mexico ; the Mescalero Apaches of southern New Mexico ; the Utes of the upper San Juan River region ; the Paiutes of southern Utah : the Tonto , White Mountain , San Carlos , and Chiricahua Apaches of southeastern Arizona ; and the Yavapais of western Arizona . Virtually all of these peoples are primarily hunters and seed gatherers who live in temporary villages or houses . Most of them practice agriculture , in varying degrees , probably learned in early times from the Pueblos . Of the ultimate origin of the varied tribes of the Southwest the anthropologist knows  |p556  little , but the number of linguistic stocks represented indicates that they have come together from sources of great diversity . Navajos and Apaches , for example , speak languages of the far-flung Athabascan stock ? traceable to Canada ? while the sedentary agricultural tribes living in the warm country of the headwaters of the Salt River speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various tribes of Pueblos no single tongue prevails . There are several languages , of wholly different stocks . Zuni and affiliated villages , for instance , have one all their own . The Pueblos today consist of 26 towns , with compact communal houses , made of adobe bricks , stones , or clay and rubble , rising two or more stories in a typical terraced or setback style of architecture . The total population is about 15,000 . These communities are primarily dependent upon farming . To maize , beans , and squash have now been added many introduced crops , such as wheat , watermelons , and various vegetables . Wild plants are used to some extent for food , and hunting adds variety to the diet . Most of the present-day pueblos lie near the upper Rio Grande in New Mexico . This eastern group consists of Picuris , Jemez , San Juan , Santa Clara , Nambe , Tesuque , Santo Domingo , San Felipe , Santa Ana , Cochiti , Zia , Taos , Sandia , and Isleta . West of these , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Acoma and Laguna . Still farther west , on the headwaters of the Little Colorado River , is the pueblo of Zuni . In northeastern Arizona , also in the drainage of the Little Colorado , are the seven Hopi villages . In this same group is the pueblo of Hano , which was settled in early historic times by immigrants from the Rio Grande region . Probably the most characteristic feature of the Pueblos , and that which was responsible for their name as given by the Spaniards , is their architecture . Several methods of applying the typical terraced style of construction are followed . At Taos the structure consists of a terraced pyramid built by erecting a large rectangular building with five stories , each one smaller by the width of a room than the one below it . Another way is to erect buildings on the four sides of a court , with each story receding in a terrace from the preceding one and ending with a perpendicular wall in the rear . Such buildings are found today at Santa Clara and Jemez . A prehistoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ruins of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico , where the structure was terraced back from a semicircular court ( Plate II ) . Skyscrapers and " Setbacks " Today , Taos and Zuni are the skyscrapers of the pueblos , reaching a maximum height of five stories . Sometimes buildings are terraced back from both sides of a street , as at Acoma ( page 552 ) . The upper tiers are entered by ladders projecting through holes in the roof , although now side doors are becoming more common . Secret religious meetings are held in subterranean ceremonial chambers . In prehistoric times these were generally circular , but at present they are usually rectangular . A ladder through an opening in the roof is the entrance ( Plate XVII ) . In some pueblos there is an increasing tendency to build individual detached houses , after the European fashion . Much of the construction work is done by women . The walls , especially of adobe structures , usually are plastered with a mixture of burned gypsum , which helps retard erosion from rain . In ancient times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of translucent selenite . Fireplaces usually are built in a corner of the room , and a hood over them carries the smoke to the chimney . In another corner , parallel with the wall , are the slab-lined mealing bins , with their stone metates for grinding corn . Recesses in the wall serve as storage places . " Sing While You Work " From earliest times Pueblo women have worked over their mealing bins to the accompaniment of special " corn-grinding " songs . In 1540 Castaneda described corn grinding almost exactly as it is done today : " They keep the separate houses where they prepare the food for eating and where they grind the meal , very clean . This is a separate room or closet , where they have a trough with three stones fixed in stiff clay . Three women go in here , each one having a stone , with which one of them breaks the corn , the next grinds it , and the third grinds it again . " They take off their shoes , do up their hair , shake their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " A man sits at the door playing on a flute while they grind , moving the stones to the music and singing together . " They grind a large quantity at one time , because they make all their bread of meal soaked in warm water , like wafers . " Corn is usually parched before it is ground .  |p565  The flour is made into a paste by adding water and cooked in the form of thin tortillas , or flapjacks , by baking on a stone slab ( Plate VII ) . Now sheet iron is often used instead of stone . Cornmeal is also eaten in the form of mush . Formerly it was cooked in earthenware vessels , but nowadays these have been supplanted by metal utensils . A picturesque adjunct of the Rio Grande pueblos is the earthen dome-shaped oven , an Old World invention which was borrowed from Mexico during early historic times . The material culture of the Indians has changed much more during the American occupation than it did under the Spaniards . Factorymade stoves are now in general use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resistance to the introduction of farm machinery has been marked , because such devices interfere with aspects of life which form the basis of traditional ceremonials . At Jemez even today mechanized plowing is prohibited . although in 1921 one man who purchased a threshing machine was permitted to operate it . At Isleta the newly erected town council house remained unfinished pending a longdrawn-out controversy as to whether an oldstyle or a tin roof should be used . Eventually the advocates of the tin roof won out . Many of the houses of the eastern pueblos now have tin roofs . New ideas filter in faster as English replaces Spanish . Pueblos Were Early Prohibitionists The Pueblo Indians were among the earliest advocates of prohibition in this country , because the governing bodies of the pueblos saw the bad effect of alcohol on their people . Most pueblos banned it . While the regulations have now relaxed in many of them , in others , such as Zuni , strict prohibition is still in force . The standard drink of Pueblo aborigines was atole , a thin gruel of cornmeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottled carbonated drinks are sold in enormous quantities . Sight-seers at such ceremonies as the Hopi snake dance find Indian venders selling soda pop , chewing gum , and cigarettes , as at a baseball game . The trading post has helped develop the Southwest . Here the Indian meets his friends . exchanges silver jewelry and gossip , and buys canned tomatoes and peaches . Here he views the latest creations of the white man . But " all prices plainly marked " take the joy out of a favorite recreation ? bargaining . In early times the pottery of the Southwest was so good it would hold water indefinitely and could be placed directly on the fire in cooking . The art degenerated after the introduction of cheap metal kitchen utensils , but the tourist demand for native art products brought about a revival . In some instances , as among the Hopi , ancient designs were revived to the great artistic improvement of the ware . At Santa Clara a new decorative technique was invented whereby patterns of dull black were produced on a glossy black surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares favorably with the ancient products . The technical quality has so declined , however , that the ware of today generally can be used only for decorative purposes . Pueblo dwellers use it chiefly for ritual . Pottery making is done by the women . After selecting her clay and removing impurities , the potter adds thinning materials and mixes with it sand or ground potsherds to help distribute the heat evenly in firing . The clay is then rolled into long strips or pencil-like ropes and the vessel is built up by a coiling process on a base of basketry or wood . The potter 's wheel was unknown in aboriginal America . Work must be discontinued from time to time to let the clay dry , since otherwise the walls would collapse . As the pot is shaped , the coils are pressed together with the thumbs and forefingers and the inner and outer surfaces smoothed with a simple tool of shell or gourd . Water is continually applied to keep the texture of the clay right and to help bind it as the coils join . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry gradually , so that it will not crack . It is then coated with a thin clay slip . A brush of yucca fiber and a pointed stick are used to apply the mineral paints of the decorative design . Usually several vessels are formed before firing . This is done by carefully piling around and over the inverted vessels a slow-burning fuel which retains the heat a long time , distributing it evenly and permitting the pots to cool gradually . The famous black ware of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso ( Plate V ) is produced by adding fresh fuel at one stage and smothering the smoke , so that the carbon is fired into the clay slip . When polished this ware takes on a high gloss . In Hopi pottery making , yellow and black are commonly used . At Zuni , black , white , and red pigments are employed . Usually No Secret Meaning in Designs Symbolism plays small part in decorative patterns , being confined aboriginally to ritualistic equipment . The question is often asked , " What does this design mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One might as well ask the meaning of the design on the wallpaper or a patchwork quilt . True , names for identification are given to certain designs or design elements , but the Indian potter , weaver , or jeweler , except where ritualistic equipment is concerned , is thinking of the decorative value of his creation and not of any secret meaning . Nowadays , however , the enterprising native artisans usually can oblige with a good explanation . Basketry , practiced in the Southwest long before pottery making , is now practically a lost art among the Pueblos , except the Hopis . The best Southwest basket makers of the present are the Pimas ( Plate XI ) and Apaches . Birth of the Rug-making Art In ancient times cotton was cultivated generally throughout the Pueblo area and used for weaving . A coarser fabric was made from yucca fiber . The early introduction of sheep from Mexico added a new textile material which gave impetus to weaving and had a profound effect upon the culture of at least one tribe , the Navajo ( pages 551 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white traders , weaving was virtually abandoned , except by the Hopis , Zunis , and Navajos . The finest weavers in the Southwest today are probably the Hopis , whose methods are typical of the art as practiced by the ancient Pueblos ( Plate XIII ) . Among the Hopis the men are the weavers . Likewise they card , spin , and dye the wool . Today , durable native vegetable coloring is supplemented with trade dyes . In weaving blankets , ceremonial kilts , and women 's dresses , Hopi men use the simple suspended hand loom . Belts , garters , and hair bands , all essentials of Hopi costume , are made on a small heddle loom . Both wool and cotton are used . Most famous of the Southwest weavers are the Navajos , to whom the art has become an important economic asset and whose colorful rugs now have a world-wide reputation . Among the Navajos , unlike the Hopis , the woman is the weaver . The Navajos probably learned weaving from the Pueblos in the early 18th century and made a specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navajo weaving was done during the 19th century from yarn obtained by unraveling bayeta , a woolen trade cloth introduced by the Spaniards . These beautifully woven blankets were usually of two colors in simple broad stripes . Navajo bayeta blankets are now rare and in demand by collectors . As the cash importance of blanket weaving developed , the Navajos increased the variety and complexity of their designs . Today , in accordance with visitor and market demands , they produce an infinite number of brilliant patterns , even including reproductions of the old sand paintings ( Plate XIV ) , a thing  |p569  which would have been an unthinkable heresy to their forebears . Much has been heard of symbolism in Navajo blanket designs . In the old days it was rarely that any pattern other than plain stripes was used , and no significance apart from decoration was intended . In modern times complex and bizarre figures are often used , most of which are introduced designs . Many of these have been woven at the instigation of traders and other whites , and successful patterns have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as decoration and not as symbols . Designs Even Copied from Advertising Now and then the Navajo weaver undertakes to copy some white man 's design . Thus it is not uncommon to see on a beautifully woven rug the words " Ivory Soap " or " Kleenex , " copied from a cardboard box ! The early Navajo weavers were much more skillful than those of the present day . Although color patterns were extremely simple , weaving techniques were much more complex and varied . About 1850 , American traders introduced vegetable-dyed yarn imported from Saxony . Laborious unraveling of woolen textiles for dyed thread was now no longer necessary , and blanket production greatly increased . About 1870 the Navajos began to produce rugs instead of the shoulder blanket or poncho , and this sharply spurred the demand . About 1880 came the brilliant and cheaper anilinedyed Germantown yarns . The modern era of Navajo weaving begins about 1890 , when the traders introduced aniline dyes , enabling the weavers to use native wool almost exclusively and making the production of rugs much cheaper . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p571  Most recently adopted of Southwest Indian arts is silver working . Except for a few scattered objects of copper received in trade from Mexico , the Pueblo Indians and their neighbors formerly knew nothing of metals or of metalworking . Silver was one of the articles the Spaniards were eager to acquire for themselves ; hence it was rarely used for trade . Finally , about the middle of the 19th century , a Mexican silversmith entered the Navajo country . The craft was learned by a few Navajos and gradually spread . Now it is practiced by several southwestern tribes , but notably by the Navajos and Zunis . As might be expected of an alien craft , the pattern of the objects manufactured and the designs were also borrowed . The earliest Navajo silver products were buttons , buckles , and clasps . Later the circular or oval silver disks called " conchas " became popular and were used as belt ornaments . In early Navajo silver work , simple designs were produced by scratching or engraving . Later , stamped designs made by iron punches or dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very recently a growing demand by discriminating white buyers has brought about , to some extent , a revival of the earlier chaste patterns . Another popular type of silver ornament is the so-called " naja , " or pendent crescent , an ancient form of Old World amulet . It was introduced as a trade object to the eastern Indians and was , like the concha , probably first observed by the Navajos as used by the tribes of the southern plains . From the Mexicans the Navajos learned to make hollow spherical silver beads , occasionally elaborated into the popular so-called " squash blossom " bead . Actually this was originally a representation of the pomegranate , a fruit entirely unknown to the Navajos . Other articles made by the Navajo silversmiths were bracelets , earrings , bow guards , and saddle and bridle decorations . At present an endless variety of " gadgets " is produced to satisfy the ever-increasing tourist trade . The first silver used by the Navajos consisted of coins obtained from Americans . Later , Mexican pesos ? of a purer grade of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Silver in sheets or bars was not introduced until the present era . Painted Land Peopled with Spirits Native turquoise , found at several localities in the Southwest , was extensively used in aboriginal times for beads , pendants , earrings , and mosaics . The native silversmith , however , did not begin to embellish his handiwork with turquoise until about fifty or sixty years ago , and not until the present century has it been commonly used in conjunction with silver ( Plates VIII and XXIV ) . The dramatic topography of the Southwest had a profound effect upon the religious ideology of the tribes who made the region their home . It is a land of tremendous distances , of fantastic formations , of red cliffs and square-cut buttes . The clear air is occasionally invaded by black storm clouds , the clamor of thunder , and the quick stab of lightning . The deep blue of the sky is painted at dawn and at sunset with colors which defy the brush of the painter . As all of this appeals to the modern artist and poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Indian . In the rising thunderclouds he saw the advancing form of the kachinas ( page 567 ) , bearing rain for his cornfield . In the rumble of the thunder he heard the beating of the wings of a mythical bird ; the whirlwind was a wandering spirit . Rich Mythology Explains All To the Pueblo Indian , his people lived in the center of the universe and all of this display of Nature was created for him . His rich mythology explained it all , and his complete belief produced in him a deep affection for those deities who made life pleasant for him . Particularly was this true of those who were directly concerned with his sustenance : the corn mother , the squash maidens , the rain gods who brought the life-giving moisture , the hunting gods who helped him find game . A surprising amount of time was passed in ceremonies designed to please this multitudinous pantheon . Like most American Indians , the Pueblos believed these beings to be the custodians of a supernatural force or power which was in part transferable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck a small stone image of a mountain lion , it represents much more than meets the eye . The mere carving of the image is but the first step in the preparation of his fetish . The priest of the proper society must perform over it a long ceremony involving hours of prayer and offerings and the placing of the figure on the altar of the hunting society . Here amid sacred objects filled with supernatural power it becomes charged with the spirit of the Mountain Lion God , the master deer hunter . When worn by the hunter , the fetish thus impregnated transmits its power to him . Whenever he starts out for deer , he prays over his little fetish , offering pollen and tobacco to the ancestral Mountain Lion .  |p572  Thus prepared , he sets forth with a confident spirit , sure that he has a powerful ally which will increase the keenness of his eye and make strong his arm . When the hunter has felled his prey , more prayers of thanks and gratitude are offered to the ancestral lion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated . The religion of the Indian is intimate and omnipresent . He feels himself as much a part of the supernatural world as are the nature gods of his own creation . To understand his activities and interpret his ceremonies , it is necessary to bear in mind always the aura of the supernatural which surrounds the individual and the complete faith with which he accepts the elaborate conceptions that are his heritage . No crisis of life , no activity bearing on the welfare of the individual or tribe , is too trivial to have its place in religion and its religious rite . Ceremony attends the individual at birth , at marriage , during sickness , and at death . It precedes planting and harvest . War expeditions , journeys ? all are fitted into the religious pattern . Nothing is haphazard ; nothing is left to fate . Moreover , all of this ceremonialism forms the warp and weft of an orderly concept of Nature with relation to man 's place in the universe . To the Indian the same deities act for good or evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into the religious pattern . Sometimes actions of good or ill are the result of mere caprice . Kiva a Primitive Planetarium Most of the ceremonies are dramatizations of mythological events dealing with the creation and legendary migrations of the tribe . The major part of the rituals is held with great secrecy in the underground ceremonial chambers , or kivas , with only the initiated present . Many rites , often lasting several days , end in public performances . In the poetic mind of the Indian the kiva represents the universe , a sort of primitive planetarium . The roof and walls are the firmament and the floor is the earth . Around the walls are benches where members of the secret society seat themselves and beyond these are imaginary benches , " cloud seats , " where the gods watch the ceremonies in their honor . In the center of the floor is a small hole representing the sipapu , the sacred place of emergence of the mythical ancestral twins from whom all mankind descended . Near this is a larger opening covered with a plank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the denizens of the underworld that a ceremony is under way . Details of belief and methods of conducting rituals differ in all the pueblos , but this description is typical . At present not all the kivas are underground and many are also used as a men 's social club . When for religious purposes a man is undergoing purification , he generally retires to the kiva , where he can best abstain from contamination . Most conspicuous among the Pueblos is the kachina cult , concerned primarily with the control of weather , particularly the bringing of rain . The kachinas are supernatural beings , usually said to have been created at the time the first ancestors of man emerged from the underworld . Others say they represent the spirits of the early ancestors of man . Their residence is conceived as being in the west , usually in some prominent mountain . There are many varieties of kachina , each having its own curious features and costume and each concerned with some aspect of Nature connected with the health and welfare of man . In some pueblos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 567 ) . Clowns Are Cosmic Court Jesters Associated with the kachinas are clowns who play a prominent part in the ceremonies ( Plate XII ) . It seems strange indeed to the white man 's mind to find comedians taking an active part in the most sacred rituals , burlesquing the solemn actions of the priests , obviously breaking the most rigid tabus , and performing obscene practical jokes on the spectators . Their most important function , the Indians say , is to relieve the intense seriousness of the ceremonies and keep the people from becoming too saddened at the sight of the kachinas . The humor displayed by these clowns is usually clever , although ordinarily somewhat broad for the white man 's taste . During the nineties Dr. J. Walter Fewkes , pioneer southwestern ethnologist , brought the first phonograph recording outfit to the Hopis , where he made records of native songs . Later another ethnologist attending a Hopi ceremony saw a group of clowns reproduce the incident . One clown with whitened face , wearing a beard and dressed in a coat and big hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonograph " out of a large box , with a big conical paper horn attached . The " doctor , " with much clowning , then induced reluctant Indians , one by one , to sing into the horn . As each finished , another per/ former , concealed in the box , sang the song back at him , imitating very well the discordant tones of the early phonograph . Masks and other sacred paraphernalia must be meticulously cared for between ceremonies by special keepers , lest ill luck and death descend on the village . Because of this fear the Pueblo Indians have always been reluctant to part with any of their ritual objects . Duplicates can be made , however , and sold with impunity , since they acquire their power only as the result of elaborate ceremony . Passing of the Scalp Society An Acoma Indian described to the writer the passing of the Scalp Society , formerly one of the strongest and most important in the pueblo . To be eligible for membership , an Acoma had to kill an enemy in combat and secure his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent and by the end of the last century had virtually disappeared . Thus at Acoma it eventually came about that only a few old men were left to conduct the ceremonies of the Scalp Society . Finally , a single aged member remained to care for the sacred material . The old Indian who gave me this story exhibited real emotion , and I give it with the same feeling with which it was told to me . A grave danger threatened the community . Should the old man die with none eligible to take his place , the neglected objects of the society would bring disaster to the community . The headmen met in grave conference , and all agreed that since no young man under present conditions could go out and collect an enemy scalp and thus become eligible , the society itself must be brought to an end before it became too late . Therefore , the old man , carefully purifying himself , spent many days in the kiva , praying , making the necessary offerings , and devitalizing the sacred masks and other objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task completed , the village remained indoors while the aged scalp priest in the early morning hours carried the emasculated equipment of his beloved society up through the door of the kiva where it had been stored since the years before the Conquistadores . Three times he descended from the rock with portions of his precious load , the last time just as the rising sun cast its ruddy hue on the summit of the Enchanted Mesa to the north . Then , bearing his burden to a point in the desert known only to himself , he laboriously buried all beneath the concealing sands . As the old man cast the sacred pollen over this unmarked crypt , well might he have reflected that it symbolized the end of an era. the beginning of a new regime . As the sun rose well above the horizon , he returned and wearily climbed the age-old rock to enter an apparently deserted city . For him this was the end ? he was unfrocked by his own will that his people might go on . Returning to the roof of the kiva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heads appeared from the doorways . The unnatural silence that had held the pueblo in its grip since the preceding night gave way to the chatter and laughter of women and the shouting of children , free to release their pent-up energies in the streets between the terraced houses . The interrupted life of the community resumed its normal way . The old priest turned to the ladder of the kiva . By habit he entered in the old ceremonial way . The paraphernalia had always been stored out of sight , but now all was changed . Until this moment he had always sat in the presence of the gods . He looked across at the " cloud seats " around the painted wall . He felt nothing there . The kiva was empty . Witches Blamed for Sickness Next in prominence to the kachina cult are the curing societies , whose primary function is the cure of disease . The therapeutic ceremonies are performed over an altar which usually consists of a symbolic dry painting made on the ground with colored cornmeal and sand . Sickness is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some foreign substance into the body . The medicine man must first diagnose the cause and then withdraw the object ( page 571 ) . Itchings and skin diseases are supposed to be caused by the spirit of the ant , and one curing society deals only with ailments believed to have been produced in this manner . At Aroma a prominent figure on the altar sand painting is the horned toad , eater of ants . The final important group of religious organizations comprises the war and hunting societies . Though the former have practically gone out of existence as warfare has ceased , some were prolonged by making a man eligible for membership through killing a mountain lion or bear instead of a human enemy . The hunting societies are still fairly active . If a man intends to hunt deer , he calls on the spirit of the mountain lion for help . If he is hunting rabbits , he calls upon that expert rabbit hunter , the eagle .  |p582  Most interesting of the various offerings to the spirits are prayer sticks . These are small pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or small bunches of leaves attached . Often faces are indicated on them , since they are supposed to carry the prayer or supplication to the deity addressed . Dancers Hold Live Snakes in Mouths Undoubtedly the most famous of all North American Indian ceremonies is the snake dance of the Hopis , held in alternate years at most of the Hopi villages ( Plate XVI ) . This is a nine-day rain ceremony held under the joint auspices of the Antelope Society and the Snake Society . Details differ in the various villages . The dance at Walpi is considered most authentic and certainly it is most colorful . At Walpi the snakes during the public ceremony are held solely by the mouths of the carriers instead of being gripped also with the hands . At Walpi , furthermore , it is considered proper to hold the snake as near the middle as possible to allow it more freedom of movement for its head . As the popularity of the snake dance has increased from year to year , the white  |p583  attendance has picked up , until now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vantage on the mesa . Many oldtimers have become regular attendants and never miss a snake dance . The ghosts of the ancient priests probably roll over in their graves if they bother to view the framework surrounding the modern ceremony . Visitors converge on the mesa . Indian venders sell soda pop and chewing gum . Native policemen are busy impounding cameras and laying down the rules of conduct to visiting Indians . Previously the snakes have been gathered by members of the Snake Society . They go out from the village in pairs , the first day to the north , the second day to the west , the third to the south , and the fourth to the east . All snakes encountered are collected , but rattlesnakes are most numerous . When captured , the snakes are put in buckskin bags and transferred to pottery vessels in the kiva , where they are used in various secret rituals during ensuing days . On the eighth day the first dance is held outside the kiva . On the ninth day the snakes are taken from the kiva and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the two societies , properly painted and costumed , then make their public appearance . The Antelope priests emerge first from their kiva and parade four times around the plaza , stamping on the foot drum in front of the snake bower at each circuit to notify the gods of the underworld that the ceremony is under way . After the fourth circuit they line up in front of the snake bower . The Snake priests then go through a similar performance , ending up in a line facing the Antelope priests . After further ceremonies the Snake priests go in groups of three to the bower and the most spectacular portion of the performance takes place . Spectators Threatened with Snakes One dancer in each group is given a snake , which he grasps in his teeth . Snake in mouth , he starts dancing down the plaza . The second member of the group distracts the serpent 's attention with a feather whip . Before long the snake is dropped and picked up by the third member of the group . As each dancer drops his snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance is repeated . Sometimes when the hands of the gatherer are full of snakes , he passes them over to the Antelope priests to hold . Now and then the gatherers lash out at a spectator with their snakes for such acts as kicking at a loose snake to drive it back or simply for encroaching too far upon the ceremonial ground . Episodes such as this sometimes create more excitement than the dance itself . On the whole , the dancers have no regard for the presence of the spectators and so far as possible ignore them completely . Finally , when all the snakes have been danced with , the head of the Snake Society pours cornmeal on the plaza in a circle divided by six radii , which represent the four world quarters , the zenith , and the nadir . The snakes are quickly thrown into this circle , where they form a writhing mass , and a group of women throws cornmeal over them . At a given signal the Snake priests rush madly up to the circle and grasp with each hand as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens twisting and squirming , they rush down the trail from the village to the level ground below , where the snakes are carried toward the four quarters of the compass and released as messengers to bear the news of the ceremony to the rain gods . Thereupon the white visitors get into their cars and hurry back to civilization in order not to be marooned by the cloudbursts which are expected to follow ( and which frequently do ) . Teamwork Helps Avoid Bites Amazed white observers often ask how venomous reptiles can be so freely handled without fatal or at least serious results . Many theories have been advanced , ranging from the idea that the Hopis have discovered a secret method of making themselves immune to snakebite , to the notion that the poison glands or fangs are first removed from the rattlesnakes . Neither of these is true . The success of the dancers in avoiding unpleasant results is probably due to two principal factors . One is skill in handling , combined with teamwork by those whose duty it is to distract the attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several days preceding the public performance the snakes have become accustomed to being handled and most of the edge has been taken from their aggressiveness . In the kivas , during captivity , the snakes are allowed to strike , thus draining their poison glands of most of the venom . It is not at all unusual for dancers to be bitten , but I have never known of serious results . Among the many so-called nomadic tribes of the Southwest the most interesting is the Navajo . When the Navajos first appeared in history , in the 17th century , they formed a  |p585  small and unimportant group . Living a seminomadic life , they built their substantial one-room hogans in winter on tops of mesas where they could best defend themselves from their enemies , the Comanches and Utes , and whence they occasionally raided the Pueblos . They practiced agriculture , but hunting also formed an important means of subsistence . In summer they lived principally in shelters covered with brush or green boughs . Lo , the Far-from-poor Navajo ! When the Spaniards arrived , bringing sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a more pastoral life ( Plate X ) . Wool production greatly stimulated weaving and the horse increased the natural desire of the Navajo to travel . Already workers in turquoise , the Navajos took readily to silversmithing . Thus , through quantity production of the two articles most in demand by outsiders , blankets and jewelry , they eventually achieved an economic status unusual among Indian tribes . The great expanse of territory in which they live is largely undesirable for agriculture . It contains no oil wells or rich mines . Hence the Navajos did not feel strongly the pressure of white competition . Industrious , keen traders , they expanded rapidly , and their herds of livestock increased . Today they are not only the largest U. S. tribe but also top all others in wealth derived from products of their own industry . Although a shrewd trader and practical business man , the Navajo is also a dreamer and a poet . He has a deep affection for the colorful canyons and massive mountains among which he makes his home , and perhaps because of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost as evanescent as the songs of beauty which leave his lips is the most interesting and possibly the earliest of his artistic achievements . This is the famed art of sand painting , which forms an important feature of Navajo curing ceremonies ( Plate 1IV ) . The art was probably borrowed from the Pueblos but elaborated upon by the Navajos . These symbolic pictures , done in dry sand of different colors , represent scenes in a myth . The curiously elongated figures of mythological beings are beautifully formed , only to be destroyed in the ceremony , as thus is  |p586  carried away the illness of the patient for whom the ritual is held . No more impressive spectacle is to be seen on the North American Continent than the Night Chants of the Navajo . Held under the stars , usually in some distant , picturesque setting , they combine the gaiety of a social gathering , the solemnity of a religious occasion , and the spectacular feature of a drama . The many dances , acts of jugglery , prayers , and songs are climaxed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their naked bodies painted with white clay , apply b u r n i n g torches to one another as they dance wildly around a blazing bonfire ( Plate XX ) . Here , as among the Pueblos , clowns burlesque the priests , imitating the acts of sleight of hand so awkwardly as to expose them , dancing out of step , and jesting with the spectators . All in all , the Navajo , fortunate in his environment , has managed more successfully than any other American Indian to adapt to his needs such traits of white culture as would most benefit him , while sacrificing little of his own basic culture , so essential to the expression of his ego . Typical of the more primitive groups of the Southwest are the Havasupais ( Color Plate IX ) . Probably the most isolated Indian settlement in the United States is their village on the floor of Havasu Canyon , a precipitous gorge cutting through the western end of Grand Canyon National Park . The Havasupais Dwell in a Gorge At the widest point of this narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado River , is the Havasupai village , hemmed in on all sides by mighty red sandstone cliffs and accessible only by a steep and perilous trail . Here the Havasupais till their fields and live during the growing season . In winter they move to the high plateau where firewood is plentiful and they can gather pinon nuts and hunt . ' Living in a region where game is fairly abundant , the Havasupais are good hunters . Venison forms an important food , and dressed deerskins bring revenue . In tanning , the brain of the deer , with marrow from the spinal canal , is worked into the skin by hand , usually to the rhythm of singing . The primitive fire drill , once almost universally used by American Indians , may still be  |p587  seen occasionally among the Havasupais . The drill , a round piece of dry mesquite wood , is rotated vigorously between the palms of the hands , with as much downward pressure as possible . An expert with this type of drill can produce fire in less than 30 seconds . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Cabeza de Vaca in 1535 when he first reached the Apaches in western Texas : " Their method of cooking is so new , that for its strangeness T desire to speak of it ; thus it may be seen and remarked how curious and diversified are the contrivances and ingenuity of the human family . " Not having discovered the use of pipkins , to boil what they would eat , they fill the half of a large calabash with water , and throw on the fire many stones of such as are most convenient and readily take the heat . When hot . they are taken up with tongs of sticks and dropped into the calabash until the water in it boils from the fervor of the stones . Then whatever is to be cooked is put in , and until it is done they continue taking out cooled stones and throwing in hot ones . Thus they boil their food . " When a Havasupai wants a wife , he gives her parents presents considered of more or less equivalent value for example , a horse priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until one or two children have blessed the union , after which he sets up a home of his own . If the marriage fails . the presents are returned . The tribes of the semidesert region of the Gila and lower Colorado Rivers present an interesting contrast both to the Pueblos and to the nomadic peoples . Culturally they stand midway between the two . Like the nomads , they live in single-family houses , but these are clustered together in true villages . Agriculture is practiced , as among the Pueblos , and irrigation is generally used . In spite of this , domestic crops are supplemented with many wild plants . A surprising number of desert plants of the region can be utilized for food . Among the most important are the mesquite bean , screw bean , yucca , and agave . The fruits of several species of cactus are eaten , that of the giant saguaro cactus being of great importance . A Primitive " Fireless Cooker " The agave , or mescal , a variety of century plant , is made edible by 24 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large pit containing hot stones . Remains of these mescal ovens are often seen in the lower Colorado region . By cooking the mescal for a longer period , the juice may be extracted and fermented , making an intoxicating drink . The ceremonial life of the village-dwelling tribes is much less elaborate than that of the Pueblos , but they place much importance upon interpretation of dreams , about which most of their religious ideas are constructed . This is particularly true of the western tribes , such as the Yuma , Cocopa , and Mojave . All of the Yuman tribes cremate the dead . The spirit is believed to remain in the body until it has been burned . Formerly , when an individual died in a house , the house and all his personal property was burned . Even today this custom is still practiced . The actual cremation , held in the open , presents a wildly barbaric scene . As the flames of the funeral pyre rise , mourners and visitors wail and cry , tearing their hair and scratching their faces . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others throw in offerings , often including money , requesting that the departing spirit take them to the spirits of their own dead relatives and friends . Mourners are required to fast for four days after a cremation . Several village tribes hold a strange memorial service for the dead . In one of these , the annual Kdrok of the Yumas , the climax consists in the public burning of images of the dead and also their personal belongings . Afterward the names of the dead are never again spoken . Beyond the Roads Life Is Little Changed In these pages has been presented , at best , but a fragmentary picture of the manner in which many different groups of Indians have adapted themselves to an interesting and unusual environment . Today the iron rails of the white man bisect the great American Southwest . Paved highways invite the automobile , but behind these narrow ribbons the great canyons remain unchanged from the day of the Basket Makers . The thunderheads rise with the same magnificence they displayed when Pueblo Bonito was in flower . The Machine Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian more lightly than many realize . The rain priests still make their elaborate calculations ; the masked dancers perform their age-old ceremonies . When the rainstorm follows , soaking the parched cornfields with moisture , the Indian , gazing through and beyond the gasoline haze of the highway , offers his quiet thanksgiving , serene in the knowledge that above and below and in the four world quarters his own gods still rule .  |p588
