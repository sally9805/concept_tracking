txt A million New Yorkers , strung along a fifteen-mile route from Flushing 's marshes to Park Avenue , stood in three inches of fresh snow in freezing temperatures yesterday to cheer Admiral of the Fleet William Frederick Halsey . In outlying districts heavily muffled mothers and school teachers , brought their charges to the curbs to wave to the man whose ships felled 3,000 Japanese planes and sank 1,650 Japanese merchant and combatant surface craft . Brooklyn and Manhattan bestowed the city accolade on the grizzled commander of the Third Fleet  --  blizzards of confetti , swirls of ticker tape , bales of torn office records and business pamphlets . Mayor La Guardia , who sat with the admiral in the frosty triumphal journey , gave him the city 's Medal of Honor at City Hall , an honor previously conferred on General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower , Admiral of the Fleet Chester W. Nimitz and Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright . In the evening Admiral Halsey was guest of honor at a testimonial dinner given by the city in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newbold Morris , President of the City Council , made a welcoming speech . Responding to Mr. Morris ' address , the admiral renewed his opposition to the proposed merger of the Army and Navy and , like the three other heroes previously welcomed by the city , called for the maintenance of a strong American military force . " There must be a permanent and continuing mechanism for mobilization of all our resources , " he declared . " The magic of merger will not achieve it . It is not the solution to a strong , healthy national defense . " The merger medicos have made a hasty diagnosis  --  they have offered a ' pink pill ' remedy . They have prescribed the cure-all of unification . " I say this is not and can not be the answer to our many problems . " Until it can be proved that the United States will gain by the merger , he said , " let us keep our victorious Navy ; let us keep it intact and unshackled ; keep it free and it will keep America free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that merger might destroy the initiative of the individual services , deprive them of representation before the Congress and the people . He said he believed strongly in unified field command because " in triphibious warfare it is a prerequisite to success . " " I worked , " he continued , " from the earliest days of the Pacific war to develop coordination and team-work . I saw it pay off . But , let me emphasize , it did n't 4-. ake the magic of merger to achieve it . " Comes to City by Train The admiral came to New York at 2 A. M. by railroad from Washington because flight conditions were bad . He left the hotel about 10:20 A. M. and reached La Guardia Field twenty minutes later . A band and two battalions of sailors drawn up on the snow awaited his arrival . The band played admiral 's honors , the sailors snapped to present arms and small cannon blued the frosty air with a seventeen-gun salute . Mayor La Guardia met Admiral Halsey as the honor guest stepped from his car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open car and , led by motorcycle escort , began the triumphal ride . Dark , icy slush sprayed from the cars ' tires and made brown bow waves when the motorcade sped through deep frozen pools . The motorcycles , of which some forty started out , coughed out as the splash caught their magnetos . When City Hall was reached only four were breaking way for the admiral . The admiral 's greatcoat was tight around his neck and a blanket covered his feet and the Mayor 's , but their faces purpled in the raw wind and their eyes tightened to slits against the steady knifing cold . The procession moved at thirtyfive miles an hour down Astoria Boulevard , into Steinway Street in Astoria , where it passed under blocks of arched electric lights , into Thirty-fourth Avenue , down Queens Boulevard , across Meeker Avenue Bridge into Brooklyn , which had asked that the procession be sent its way . Snow shovelers stood gravely at attention with their wide shovels , Greenpoint matrons waved arms hampered by the day 's shopping . In Penn Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloft a sheet of cardboard with the black-inked legend , " Welcome Home , Bull ! " Crowds increased in density through Brooklyn  --  along Union Avenue , Bedford Avenue , Fulton Street , Flatbush Avenue Extension . Students of Brooklyn High School for Specialty Trades cheered and waved at Concord and Bridge Streets just before the motorcade pushed onto freshly sanded Manhattan Bridge . As Hie wailing escort and the cars came off Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive a gust caught the admiral 's cap . It landed in the slush , gold braid and all , but was hastily retrieved , clapped back on the gray head , and the procession swung into South Street . Knots of seamen called hoarsely to the admiral , the Victory ship Roy K. Johnson cut loose a blast with its siren and , at Seamen 's Church Institute , sailors with noses flattened against the panes watched the Admiral go by . The paper blizzard started as the procession turned into lower Broadway . The admiral got up on the back of the open car , waving to the curb crowds and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread from curb to curb in two ranks , with pennants slatting , the Sanitation Department band and details of sailors and Coast Guards moved out ahead of the admiral 's party from Bowling Green . Financial District " Gives " Then the welcome reached high gear . Paper in every shape and color , ticker tape in contorted spirals , large sheets of bond and foolscap , fell on the admiral 's and the Mayor 's shoulders and martial tunes echoed and re-echoed in the financial district 's shadowed can yons . At Trinity Church hundreds of ' startled pigeons rose from the dark ' eaves in sudden flight , barely dis-1 tinguishable from the larger paper sheets that floated and turned in , the cold air . Fifteen hundred sailors , Coast Guards and a Marine Corps honor guard , red-faced with cold , came to sharp salute in City Hall Park as the cars swung in to City Hall ' steps . Mrs. Frances Grandy Halsey , the admiral 's wife , and Mrs. Preston Lea Spruance , their daughter , joined the party in the Mayor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and citation in the Council chamber before 100 guests . He lauded Admiral Halsey as " daring , dashing , determined and devastating " and praised the Navy 's extraordinary record . " The deep-rooted affection we have for the Navy , the men who command it , and the men who serve in the Navy , " Mr. La Guardia said , " is so deep in men 's hearts that no politicians in Washington can take it away . " He established Admiral Halsey 's right to the title " Son of New York " by recalling that he is a grandson of the Rev. Charles H. Halsey , who was the first rector of Christ Episcopal Church at Fifth Avenue and Eighteenth Street , almost 100 years ago . Responding , Admiral Halsey said : " It is a genuine pleasure to accept this symbol of your friendship . As combat commander I know your accomplishments here were a key to our success out there . I take pride , then , in receiving this medal . I accept it in behalf of the men who fought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well done . ' " The ride from City Hall to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , where the admiral and his party were guests at an informal luncheon , was a continuation of the first leg of the triumphal parade . It started at 12:40 P. M. At Twenty-sixth Street and Fifth Avenue the motorcycles cut During the ceremonies at City Hall , where the Admiral received the City 's Medal of Honor The New York Times out . Another contingent of mounted policemen and a Sanitation Department band set the pace northward . In the Thirties shopping area fur-coated Ch- ? i-tmas buyers crowded to the curbs to wave and cheer and to take the admiral 's salute . Past the Library , between cheering thousands , the cortege moved at marchers ' pace . Midday throngs shrilled and applauded at Rockefeller Center . Across the way Archbishop Francis J. Spellman arid Archbishop James of Toronto , in colorful robes , waved and took the admiral 's smile and salute . The procession turned east in Fifty-seventh Street , then down Park Avenue to the WaldorfAstoria Hotel . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the city 's welcome he said : " I thought it was wonderful to see those thousands of good , smiling faces , particularly after looking at dirty Japanese faces . " He said he has no plans as yet , for the period that will follow his retirement , nor could he tell when he will be retired . He was fairly certain of only one thing : " I expect to be a witness in the Pearl Harbor investigation , but I ca n't say when that will be . " Just before the dinner the admiral received a gold life-membership plaque at the Metropolitan Club , Fifth Avenue and Sixtieth Street , the first honorary life membership ever voted in the club 's fifty-four years ' existence . Lee Warren James , club president , turned over the plaque with the smiling comment : " You have taken Tokyo and you took New York . .. . The Japs gave you unconditional surrender . So do we .
