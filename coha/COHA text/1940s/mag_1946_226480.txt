Protestant leaders cried : " No Popery ! " Protestant opposition to Catholic secular power and influence was growing . <P> Three weeks ago Princeton Theological Seminary 's John A. Mackay spoke his concern over Catholic clericalism and its " vilification " of Protestant leaders ( TIME , March 25 ) . Last week New York 's Methodist Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam , president of the Federal Council of Churches , chose the Catholic stronghold of Boston to set forth the Protestant grievance in spade-calling terms . Excerpts : <P> " Unfortunately , the Roman Catholic Church approaches the question of religious liberty from two points of view-one from principle , the other from expediency . As a matter of principle it holds : ' It is not lawful for the State ... to hold in equal favor different kinds of religion . ' It is opposed to the separation of Church and State . It insists that where Roman Catholics are in the majority , the State should further that faith and restrict other faiths from criticism , missionary activities , deny them exemption from taxation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now on the basis of expediency , the church tolerates the separation of Church and State , and the fact of other churches . However . . . this toleration is not necessarily a permanent commitment . . . . <P> " We call upon the Roman Catholic Church to be a church and not to attempt to be a state and a church . We shall bring practices to light that we believe constitute a threat to religious freedom . We shall speak firmly but in brotherly spirit . " <P> Editorially , the Pilot , official organ of the Boston archdiocese , wrung its hands : " G. Bromley Oxnam has to live with himself . Undoubtedly he says prayers before he retires at night . In these orisons , in his baring of soul before a God Who reads our innermost hearts , let the Bishop weigh his responsibility for the confusion he spread in that . . . talk , for the pain he inflicted on all whose only trust is the Crucified Hope of the world , for the delight he gave to those who try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only god worthy of rational worship . . . . At the heart of his objection to the Catholic Church is his unwillingness to acknowledge the divinity of Christ . " <P> Communist Parallel . New York 's Oxnam was not the only Protestant leader to keelhaul Catholicism . In London last week , Professor A. Victor Murray , president of England 's Congregational Cheshunt College , said : " Rome . . . believes itself to be the perfect society . . . . Anything that furthers its interests , political or social , as well as religious , is considered to be according to the will of God . ... It is this irresponsible influence of an internationally organized society , with its headquarters in a foreign country-in this way exactly parallel to communism-that makes the Free Church Protestant evangelical witness against Rome so vitally necessary .
