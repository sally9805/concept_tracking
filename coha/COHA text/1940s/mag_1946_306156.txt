After a long , hard look at U.S. high schools , from opposite ends of a telescope , two educators last week agreed on the basic trouble with U.S. secondary education : too much book learning . <P> In the January Harper 's , George Henry , principal of a 350-student high school in Dover , Del. , contends that a third of all high-school students ca n't read or write well enough to learn much of anything from textbooks . What 's more , he adds gloomily , they never will be able to . Says he : <P> " The state accepted long-ago the principle that all pupils , bright and dull , were entitled to the same education . But the right to learn does not seem to carry with it the ability . . . . <P> " Most parents regard passing ... as a child 's democratic right . . . . Unless a teacher wishes to be picked to pieces . . . she can not fail a third of her pupils , and so she passes nearly everybody . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little education , even for the others , is now going on . " <P> George Henry is convinced that the one-third are not necessarily either stupid or underprivileged ; they are just " nonverbal . " Many of them have good minds and superior talents ( " the kind of intelligence it takes to build a boat from blueprints " ) . Some cities now put such students in vocational schools-but there , Henry objects , they take four years to learn what they could learn ( with pay ) in industry in a few months . His recommendations : more movies and radios in the schools , much more pioneering in the uses of arts-drama , music and painting , " to sharpen the awareness of pupils to their everyday surroundings . " <P> Sargent v. Twelve-Year-Olds . Harvard 's articulate Dean of Architecture Joseph Hudnut would like to cut down on rote textbook learning , not only for the " nonverbal " third , but for all high-school students . Says he in the January Magazine of Art : <P> " The spirit of the workshop . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a workshop for letters where poems and stories are made ; workshops for dancing and for music ; workshops for the art of living together in houses , that ridiculous name domestic science being forever anathema . . . . Not science but the goal of science is important . . . . Cookery , for example , is a better discipline in our schools than chemistry . The ingredients of a cake are science , art and good sense , all of which can be blended there into a very pretty simulacrum of the good life . . . . " <P> The art that Dean Hudnut feels a need for in U.S. schools is " that kind of making and doing which illuminates life , gives it interest and importance , and which , through education , makes life a common experience . . . <P> " I would have high-school students wholly ignorant of art history until after they had learned to paint and write and build . ... I find few things more depressing than the correct appraisements of works of art by juvenile critics accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I admire Sargent I am ready to defend him . . . against all comers under twelve years of age .
