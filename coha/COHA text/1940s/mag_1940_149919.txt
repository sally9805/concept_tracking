This winter obedient Japanese millions , reading the Government 's vague phrases in their newspapers , may not know exactly what Premier Fumimaro Konoye means by the New Structure he is building in Nippon , but they know something new is going on . <P> Every Japanese has been limited to one cotton towel a year . Foreign news films have disappeared from the theatres . There is strict rationing of gauze , absorbent cotton , condensed and powdered milk . Picture post cards or magazine pictures of Imperial and military buildings , factories , other landmarks , have been prohibited . Geisha girls can not have permanent waves , fancy coiffeurs , heavy makeup , manicures , high heels or too bright kimonos . Tokyo Imperial University students must walk to school if they live within two kilometres , can go to the theatre only on weekends or holidays , ca n't go at all to mah-jongg parlors , billiard saloons , cafes , bars . Tokyo cafes can have only one waitress per six square metres of floor space , instead of one per four square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands who own private cars . <P> Last week in Tokyo the Government went further . Laws were passed for total control of foreign trade , news reports , daily necessities , prices and uses of farmland . <P> Meanwhile the immediate cost of Structural Newness began to come clear . For fiscal 1941-42 Tokyo experts foresaw the greatest of Japan 's many huge budgets , calling for more than ten billion yen-five billions for war purposes alone-and requiring more than six billions of new borrowing . Such a budget would be greater than Japan 's entire funded debt in 1937 when the Sino-Japanese war started .
