Chile 's Ambassador Rodolfo Michels and the State Department 's Under Secretary Sumner Welles , apostle of hemisphere unity , last week signed a Lend-Lease agreement in Washington . The agreement did not greatly improve Chile 's actual prospects of getting needed industrial equipment while there is a shipping shortage ( see p.27 ) . But the general warmth of Chilean and U.S. relations moved stern , unsmiling President Juan Antonio Rios to make an extraordinary statement in Santiago : he came out for a fourth term for Good Neighbor Roosevelt . President Rios , now in his first ( four-year ) term , expressed the hope that President Roosevelt " will continue to head the Government of the U.S. until he has completed his work of generous cooperation with the American nations . " <P> President Rios added that he hoped no one would think that he was interfering in " intra-American politics . "
