The scene was like many U.S. countrysides in summer-except for the bananas ripening and the big black beans on the low-spreading trees . The lazy day was sunny ; the air was warm . A cock crew . Chickens sputtered . A voice sarcastically admonished somebody headed the wrong way : " Where you goin ' ? " Then the artillery let go . <P> This was Saipan , as recorded by Lieut . Loyal ( " Larry " ) B. Hays and Technical Sergeant Keene Hepburn of the U.S. Marines . After 13 days there , they were back in the U.S. last week , editing 15 to 20 hours of the best portable wire and disc recordings of battle action made during World War II . They put home-fronters ( CBS , We , the People ) just about as close to the battle as they could get without participating in it . <P> The Hays-Hepburn recordings are notable for : 1 ) their extreme clarity ; 2 ) their naturalness , which is the result of letting battle sounds speak pretty much for themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that war is any place for histrionics . I do n't believe in yelling ' here they 're coming down the stretch ! ' " <P> " I 'm Gon na Die . " Hays &; Hepburn began their recording aboard ship with the Amphibious Corps on the way to Saipan , setting the battle scene by casual conversations with privates and admirals , by recording 250 men singing Abide With Me ( and obviously meaning it ) in the ship 's sweaty hold , led by a sweating chaplain . The recorders were near the beachhead in a landing craft as the first wave of Marines went in , Hays quietly telling what he saw , Hepburn manipulating the controls and making one anxious comment for all to hear : " If that 's not recording , I 'm gon na die . " <P> The push to Garapan gave Hays &; Hepburn special problems . It was so hot that the fluid in their batteries boiled while charging . Their equipment was frequently choked by clouds of coral dust from the roads . But they managed to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting the microphone gather the battle noises : wounded groaning , Jap bullets pinging against metal , the sharp splat of mortar shells exploding , the high hum of planes , artillery in the background , and the cries of men giving battle directions . <P> " You Got to Walk . " Through this bloody action , Hays kept on recording conversations with Marines : talk , constant nervous laughter and incoherence . " Sometimes you laugh , sometimes you 're scared , run , " says a Flatbush , Brooklyn , boy . " Are you scared ? " asks Hays . " Well , I could n't sleep . " Says one Texas Marine , wounded by fire from undisclosed Japanese pillboxes on a knoll : " You just got to walk till you find them . " <P> Hays &; Hepburn plan to return to the South Pacific soon with new equipment . Hays worries about the necessity of using words to describe action . Says he : " The whole thing does n't come through a radio . If you turn the radio on full blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . But try as I will , you can never get it . Your throat becomes a bottleneck and the words jell in your mouth . " Even so , his warcasting is the best to date .
