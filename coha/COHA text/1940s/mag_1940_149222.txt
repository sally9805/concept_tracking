Bouncing along on a Manhattan subway last May , innocent Leo Pigola , 45 , shifted nervously under the hard , steady stare of a middle-aged woman who was seated across the aisle . When the woman asked : " Do I know you ? " and " Did you ever live near Eighth Street and Second Avenue ? " timid Mr. Pigola had had enough . Explaining that he came from Paterson , N. J. , he slipped off the train at the next stop . <P> Fortnight ago , still staring hard , Mrs. Mary Klein appeared in Paterson with her daughter , Juliet . She commandeered a detective , went looking for Leo Pigola . Finally she found him , hawking fruit from a truck . She had him arrested , taken to court . There she charged him with desertion , told the judge that Leo Pigola was really Ballou Klein , her husband , who had disappeared in 1922 with their savings of several hundred dollars , stranding her with three infants . In vain Mr. Pigola protested that he was a Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had never be fore laid eyes on Mrs. Klein . <P> Last week they had it out in court . Mrs. Pigola , two little Pigolas and 75 Pigola supporters went along to back him up . <P> Mrs. Klein brought three children , a sister and 30 friends . Looking very uneasy as Mrs. Klein 's cohorts squinted at him , tickled him to make him laugh ( a witness was sure he would never forget Mr. Klein 's laugh ) , demanded his signature , Mr. Pigola finally convinced the court that he was Mr. Pigola . Angry Pigolates and Kleinsters bandied insults as the case was dismissed . Mrs. Klein shook her head , sadly muttered : " He looks like him , every bit of him looks like him . "
