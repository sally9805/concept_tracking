Catching a mountain lion in a coyote trap is quite a surprise . Finance Minister Ramon Beteta last week found how it feels . He had set out to run down the silver smugglers who had been cheating the government of export taxes and dollar earnings . He ended up with the ultra-conservative Banco de Comercio , S.A. , the country 's biggest private banking house , on his hands . <P> Mexican silver production is strictly regulated by the government , which imposes a 15% tax on exports to support the value of silver in the Manhattan free market. * For more than a year Mexican treasury officials had suspected a big leak in silver shipments . Despite controls , there always seemed to be enough high-grade Mexican silver in Manhattan to cause prices to fluctuate between 70 and 77.5 cents an ounce . Earlier this year , Beteta put some of his best investigators on the problem . <P> Across the Border . Three months ago , with the investigation beginning to simmer , Beteta had a visit from Anibal de Iturbide , manager of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his chief of exchange had been enriching the bank by illegal silver sales . <P> Following up this lead , Beteta 's agents traced some 80 sales totaling more than 9,000,000 silver pesos , with an estimated profit of more than $1,000,000 . All the silver had been turned over to a notorious smuggler named Roberto Maese , who moved it across the border to El Paso . Each deal had at least two profitable angles : 1 ) it evaded the export tax ; 2 ) the bank sent out old-style silver pesos , whose metal value is now higher than the face value , and replaced them in its own accounts with paper money . <P> Run on the Bank . Maese was arrested ( and released on bail ) . At the customhouse in Ciudad Juarez , 62 inspectors were fired , 25 other officials suspended , and 76 employees either fined or transferred . The Banco de Comercio was fined 200,000 pesos ( $23,121 ) . <P> When the smuggling story broke in Mexico City , Beteta was unexpectedly faced with the possibility of a financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Comercio . Said the pro-Communist El Popular : " Every patriotic depositor should withdraw all funds at once . " Beteta ' asked editors and financial writers to go easy on the bank . <P> At week 's end the threat of a bank run appeared to be ended , but Mexican bankers and politicos had not heard the last of smuggled silver . Congressmen were ready to take the matter up this week . <P> <P> *Newly mined U.S silver does not enter the free market . The U.S. Mint buys it at a subsidy price of 90.5 an ounce .
