Winston Churchill 's redhaired , green-eyed actress daughter , Sarah Churchill , last week showed that she possesses , in a diluted form , some of the same eloquence that characterizes her eminent father . She composed a wartime torch song . <P> A onetime chorus girl , four-a-day vaudeville toe dancer , radio Juliet to Leslie Howard 's Romeo , Daughter Churchill , 26 , is the wife of Austrian-born , U.S.-naturalized Comedian Vic Oliver . For his Sunday-night variety show over BBC she wrote her ballad , humming the melody while Husband Oliver strummed it on a piano . Best lines , as sung and recorded by oldtime Cinemactress Bebe Daniels : <P> Some day windows will light again , <P> Street lamps twinkle by night again . <P> Now , though times are strange , <P> Our love can never change . <P> Chorus : <P> I give you my heart so you wo n't be alone , <P> Please keep it while I am away . . . . . <P> Though the road may be hard and the <P> way may be long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strong . <P> I give you my heart-it is all that I own ; Please keep it while I am away . . . .
