By last week the Republican-led 80th Congress had been in session nine weeks . To date it had not accomplished much : it was still getting ready to do a lot of things . <P> The House had a surface air of complacency ; in fact , it could hardly muster a quorum . The reason was that most of its work-cutting Treasury funds by some $900 million , considering plans to improve the Panama Canal or admit Hawaii as a state-was being done in committee . <P> On the floor , members whooped it up on a vote to change the name of Boulder Dam back to Hoover Dam , and challenged the Senate to a ball game . <P> Tension . Over in the Senate , the galleries were nearly empty . During the week , the Senate had managed to approve the appointment of Lewis W. Douglas as Ambassador to Britain , send the Military Merger Bill to the Armed Services Committee , vote OPA into oblivion ( expiration date : June 30 ) , and promise a cut of $4 billion in the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stew around while colleagues on both sides of the aisle belabored the Congressional Record with eulogies of William Randolph Hearst ( see PRESS ) , editorials and letters from the folks at home . Gradually , such stewing had brought a general Senate tension . <P> It was not relieved by the Gallup poll report that the Republicans had fallen to second place in U.S. favor ( TIME , March 10 ) . Massachusetts ' Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . roasted his colleagues by inserting an editorial from the Worcester ( Mass . ) Telegram in the Record . Said the editorial : " It is high time an aroused public opinion again reminded the Republican Party why it was chosen at the polls last November . ... In an atmosphere of political pussyfooting , the Republicans have been eyeing 1948 . . . . " <P> That began the real news of the week . Then , on one of the Senate 's days off , freshman Senator Raymond E. Baldwin ( ex-governor of Connecticut ) sent a letter to Colorado 's Eugene D. Millikin , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rebuke to the G.O.P. leadership for ignoring the Senate 's Republican fledglings , and a demand for party unity and action . It was signed by 15 other Republican freshman Senators . <P> While he was in the writing mood , Baldwin had also got off a letter to Party Chairman Carroll Reece . Said he : " The report of the Gallup poll indicates that the trend is ... away from us . Why is this so ? . . . Are we united ? " Veteran Campaigner Baldwin thought not , and he thought he saw one of the main reasons . " There are a lot of good men who would like to run for President . We have some darn good candidates , but there is n't a team-at least in the Senate-to help put any one of these fellows across . The greatest help that any candidate could have is a good record-a good record by this Congress-and I mean the whole Congress . " <P> While Republicans blinked and Democrats grinned , there came another blast . South Dakota 's ultra-conservative Republican Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of Congress are in confusion among themselves . . . . We have failed in everything which we promised the voters . ... I predict that unless the Republicans come alive . . . . they will fail again when the next election comes around . "
