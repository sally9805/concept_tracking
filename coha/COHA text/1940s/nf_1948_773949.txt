txt 6o Making Housekeeping Easy chores . If you consciously try to breathe deeply and correctly as you hum or sing , you 'll be improving your voice at the same time . And whenever you use a long-handled utensil , do n't allow your shoulders to hump over . Keep your back straight , both for beauty and to lessen fatigue . Bend , as necessary , from the hips , with your weight on your toes and your knees unlocked . Beauty while you wash . Bending over the wash tubs has its compensations in beauty too . The actual rubbing of clothes helps to develop lovely shoulders and bust lines . The bending is good for reducing the tummy and strengthening the back . The hot steaut which makes you perspire so freely is excellent for the skin . To take advantage of this last , after you finish your washing , dash a little cold ' ater on your face and neck , to close the pores and to give your skin that soft , dewy look . To prevent the backache that sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands above your head reach back as far as you can . This helps prevent a dowager 's hump at the back of your neck and gives your throat a firmer line ? as well as relaxes . By the time you 've finished your wash you wo n't be so interested in hanging it out the beauty way , by squatting lightly for every piece ? to promote agility and firmer thighs . Rather , toting your washbasket around on your kitchen table on wheels ? or anything else to eliminate effort ? will seem like a wonderful idea . The light squatting ( really a lady-like sinking to the heels with one foot advanced ) can be reserved for less arduous days when a few picking-up exercises are more needed . Beauty while you cook . Before you can cook , you must prepare the food . If this entails sitting down , here is an opportunity for you to think in terms of perfect posture ? as well as peeled potatoes . Practicing sitting with your hips touching the back of the chair , your chest high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improves your figure as you peel . At the stove , alternate your stirring , using your left hand as frequently as your right . Here , too , practice your chest up , Beauty While You Work 6i shoulders relaxed , tummy in , hips " tucked under " posture . And when you taste something hot , blow on it hard . . . as if you were trying to inflate a balloon . Such blowing is wonderful for offsetting nose-to-mouth wrinkles and firming cheeks . Beauty while you iron . If you stand to your ironing , do n't sink back on your heels and push your way through the job . Keep your weight balanced on the balls of your feet , your chest up , your knees supple , and let your arms swing freely from the shoulder . . . lightly . The iron should do most of the work . You should merely be guiding it . Properly done , ironing is good for arm beauty . Try ironing with each hand in turn . This is relaxing . If you sit to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll find this less fatiguing . Beauty while you clean . Sparkling windows can put a gleam in your eye , if you combine your window washing with some deep-breathing exercises . Taking down curtains , the washing of walls , are both excellent stretching exercises . The moving and removing of furniture , the picking up of rooms , the polishing of furniture are all good for the roses-inthe-cheek and figure departments . In moving furniture , be sure to keep the back straight , and push against what you guess to be the furniture 's center of gravity . Do n't just push anywhere ? at the top or the bottom . And let your legs , not your hack , do the pushing . You may avoid a bad strain by rcinenilerin ; this . When you pick up your rooms in the early morning , you will be fresh enough to use the preferred squatting technique so beneficial to your grace and figure . Never do it when you are overtired . A little goes a long way . In lifting , do n't let your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees a little and let the straightening of your legs assist with your lifting . Polishing furniture ? the two-handed way ? is excellent for the shoulders , back , bust , and upper arms . Keep your chest high and your spirits up as you work . Under the kerchief you wear to keep the dust out of your // hair , wind your pin curls with one row clockwise , the next counter-clockwise , for natural looking waves . Beauty while you dishwash . Posture is one thing to be conscious of as you dishwash . However , there is something quite different which you can combine with dishwashing nicely . That is the memorizing of poetry for voice training and flexibility of the lips . By propping a book of your favorite poems over the sink , you can add surprisingly to your memory 's store of verses , at the same time as by over-pronunciation and exaggeration of lip movements as you recite , you can keep your lips flexible and soft , and relieve any tendency to tenseness . Beauty While You Wait Odd moments through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add up to a lot of beauty if you make use of them regularly . Instinctively , you will use many of them for that most beneficial of all beauty treatments ? relaxation . In others you can fit most of your beauty check-up and repair jobs so essential to good grooming ? with even a little poise-building to make life more interesting . Relax with your feet up . Doctors for years have been advocating this position . Beauty specialists have recently " discovered " it . You , in the privacy of your living-room or bedroom , can use it to advantage whenever you have a few minutes to spare . Simply get out an ironing board and prop one end up on the seat of the divan , letting the other rest on the floor . Then prepare for laughs . The idea is for you to get on this ironing board and lie on it for as long as your relaxing period allows , letting the blood rush out of your tired feet and back to your head where it can furnish new mental stimulus and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended your blood to be rushing to your feet all the time . ) You 'll probably look and feel very awkward the first time you try this , but once on the board you 'll want to go right to sleep . ( The getting off will be awkward too . It 's well to try this the first time when you are all alone ! ) // If you have no ironing board which is detachable , you can simply lie on the floor with pillows under your hips and your feet on the seat of a divan or chair . Try to put enough pillows under your hips so there is a straight , or nearly straight , line from your feet to your shoulders . For speedier relaxing , pretend you 're a rag doll . One of the quickest ways to take the kinks out of your muscles and thoughts is to sit on the edge of a kitchen chair ? or any other straight chair ? with your feet planted widely and firmly apart . Now lean forward limply , letting your hands , arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your outstretched knees . Once you arrive as close to the floor as you can get , remain in that position for a few seconds , swinging your head and arms slightly as if you really are a rag doll and have n't a care in the world . There 's something about that loose swinging that seems to make your cares really vanish when you straighten up . Practice sitting down gracefully . Considering that we rise and sit down millions of times during a lifetime , it certainly is worth a few of your odd moments to learn to do this the graceful way . It 's a real poise-builder . Models and actresses arc taught to approach a chair from an angle , to sit down in it lightly all in one graceful movement , so there is a lovely long line from their shoulder to the tip of the toe facing their audience . The trick is to let your legs rake care of your sitting down . As you approach the chair , advance the foot which is to be your back foot as you sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the calf of the same leg " find " the chair . Then pivot on your feet , keeping your weight on the foot nearest the chair , and drop lightly to the chair , letting your thigh muscles actually seat you . Your ankles are automatically crossed in a graceful position . If you wish to cross your legs , this can be done by crossing your legs above the knees as you pivot ? a little more difficult , but quite easy with practice . As in standing , a slightly sidewise position is more attractive for sitting than a full front face . For poised standing , always advance one foot a bit toward your audience and keep your weight on the forward foot . // Use a little time for clothes checking . In-between moments are just right for keeping your clothes in order . The few seconds or minutes spent in sewing on snaps and buttons , in pressing and rejuvenating , pay wonderful dividends in good grooming . Keeping the mending basket handy with socks and such cuts down on your regular weekly mending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalp ? start at the nape of the neck and rub your thumbs in circles along the hair line , " lifting " the scalp as you work . Let the other fingers join in the rotating and lifting movements until your whole scalp tingles and looks pink . This not only stimulates the circulation of the scalp , but helps to relieve a nervous headache . Giving your hair a good too strokes following the massage takes but a few minutes more . I lave two brushes ? 5o strokes with each hand goes more quickly and equalizes the upper arm exercise . Train eyebrows in seconds . Just a few brushings each day , with an occasional tweezing of stray hairs , and your eyebrow grooming is perfect . If you can give yourself a facial . . . Facials are super de luxe fill-ins for odd moments , if you can give yourself one . If you do n't know how , it 's worth learning . Watch your magazine beauty columns . In any case apply some good emollient cream to your face every day ? preferably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent time . After doing some grimy chore when a general clean-up is in order is another good time . But any time when you have a few moments and a clean face , rub in a little cream to soften and beautify your skin . Always use an " up " motion . Remove surplus cream with tissues and a skin lotion. , lf you have no skin lotion , use soap and water and dry carefully . Apply a hand lotion or make-up cream afterwards . Leaving a film of cream on your eyelids helps to ward off crcpiness and gives a youthful sheen . If you are not satisfied with your lipstick technique .. . Try tising a lipstick brush to get that lighter , more natural look . Practice in your spare moments . // Buff your nails . Whether you wear nail polish or not , your nails require buffing regularly to remain strong and lustrous . This is a good **43;528;TOOLONG habit . If your buffer is n't handy , you can always rub them on the palm of the opposite hand . File your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nail casualties . . . and to give your nails a daily going over as time allows . Having your hands in water makes your nails grow very rapidly , you 'll notice . To save your manicure time later . Removing old polish always takes a few minutes ? just about the right kind of time for an in-between beauty treatment . Cuticle care can be fitted in the same way . So can the repair of chipped polish . While a completely new polish job is always preferable , there are emergencies when a patched one must do . To repair a chipped nail ? simply smooth down the edge of the chip with an emery board , dab on matching polish lightly , and just before it dries , coat the entire nail with colorless polish or " seal . " And always have a mirror in the kitchen . You know how handy this is for a last minute look-see when the doorbell rings . Have you thought of it as a means of really enhancing your basic charm ? Models and other famous beauties learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What better time and place than your own kitchen while you are waiting for the supper to get done ? 6 IF You love a home with that spic and span look , then keeping yours shining and attractive wo n't seem like all work and no reward . ( Even on dull days ! ) Thinking in terms of " good grooming " instead of " housecleaning , " also helps . And when you consider it , that 's what housecleaning really is : good groom ing ! Just as there arc certain things you must do every day , every week , and every once-in-a-while to keep yourself shining and attractive , so there are certain things you must do every day , every week , and every once-in-a-while to keep your home the same way ! You 'll be happier about the whole business , too , if you really dress for it . Not in just anything , but in clothes which fit the job . A gay bandana is becoming and keeps the dust out of your hair . If it also conceals beautifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know ? It 's better to do your hair up while you 're working and alone , than disillusion your public ? boudoir or otherwise . A play suit , with the skirt off until the doorbell rings , makes any household job seem more fun ? and usually lots easier because of the freedom of action it gives . If you really want to get down to first principles , you might wear a bathing suit . ( k cep an **36;573;TOOLONG dress nearby ! ) Just having to pass a succession of mirrors daily will inspire you to keep your figure in better shape ! 66 // And low-heeled shoes . . . and gloves ! Remember ? Now for your actual cleaning . To lessen the confusion , each of the three general types ? daily , weekly , and that grand-daddy of all cleanings , spring or fall cleaning ? will be discussed separately . FIRST ? YOUR EQUIPMENT You could do a kind of " get by " housecleaning with lots less equipment than was mentioned in the first chapter and is repeated here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for a well-stocked cleaning closet , which will be adequate for even the most rigorous cleaning ? and will make your grooming routines as pleasant as possible , you 'll need : Keep all cleaning equipment in one place . A tidy cleaning closet with everything in its place , is a good first step in any cleaning program . If your kitchen , back hall , or entry does n't boast such a spot , see if you ca n't evolve one . Actually the space required is not great ? just some one corner where you can hang // up your broom , carpet sweeper , mops , brushes , and dustpan with clips , ringed tops or between nails ; where you can have a shelf for bottles , cans , and the basket or box in which you keep your miscellaneous cloths , rags , cleaners , and polishes all together and easily transportable ; and where there is enough floor space for your vacuum cleaner and attachments , as well as your scrubbing brush and pail .

Husbands and all men , these days , es pecially men who have been in the armed forces , know a great deal about healthful eating . They expect their women to have at Icast a nodding acquaintance with the rules of sound nutrition . And rightly ! But you do n't have to rush right out and get a book on the subject to know how to plan nutritious meals . The scientists have given you a short cut ? The Basic 7. // Nutritionists tell us that if we include foods from each of the Basic 7 groups in our daily diet , in the quantities indi cated , then we will have supplied our bodies with their essential nutritional needs for the day , and we can fill out our menus as our fancy , budget , and the state of the local markets dictate . Following the guidance of the Basic 7 also insures a well-balanced diet ? one in which none of the three major food ele ments : carbohydrates , fats , proteins , is used excessively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more intelligent on the whole subject and know how to make substitutions , if necessary , when you go to the markets . Or , if you prefer , you can skip the next few pages and get right on with the business of actual menu planning . // It takes a combination of these foods to produce the fuel . ( measured in calories ) required to keep the body warm , running , and in good repair . If the body does n't get enough fuel value out of the food eaten , it burns its own tissue . This results in stunted growth in children ? chronic fatigue , listlessness , and loss of weight in adults . If the body gets too many calories , the surplus carbohydrates and fats are stored as fat . A surplus of protein has no ill effect . A high protein intake is considered desirable , rather than otherwise . " I'he number of calories of food needed daily varies with the age , size , sex , and activity of the individual . A moderately active woman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderately active man of average size about 3,000 . AVithout being too technical , you can judge whether your diet is providing the proper amount of calories , by watching your weight . Extra pounds mean too many calories ; loss of pounds , too few ? if your health is normal , of course . In addition to the proteins , carbohydrates , and fats neces sary for bodily health , there are two other classes of food nu trients vital to well-being ? the minerals and vitamins . It takes many minerals ? calcium , phosphorous , iron , cop-per , potassium , sulphur , sodium , chlorine , magnesium , iodine ? to build strong bones and teeth , to regulate the body functions , to neutralize body fluids , to produce strong muscles and healthy blood . The following are those most likely to be under-supplied in the average diet : // Vitamins , you know , arc responsible for giving YOU that top-of-the-world feeling . All arc important in keeping the body at its best , but each has its own particular role to play : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meal , the day , or the week , is largely one of practice . Experienced housewives usually plan by the week . This enables them to buy in larger quantities , to save time and energy in shopping , to cook a second day 's dishes often at the same time as the previous day 's ? or to cook in double quantity deliberately for " planned-over " servings . Even as a beginner you will find it just as easy to think of seven days ' meals as two or three days ' once you really get started . One meal seems to lead to another until before you know it you have the whole week 's tentative menus made our . Notice the word " tentative . " No menus can be considered final until you 've been to the markets . There you may be forced to make substitutions for budget or supply reasons or you may conic upon some unusual bargain or item you just fancy and can fit in nicely . Start with the meal patterns . Jr may seem childish , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and head them : Sunday , Monday , " Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday . On each of these copy off the meal patterns for whatever meals you are planning for that day . If your husband and/or yourself will be away for lunch on certain days , that reduces your meal planning by that much . ( Ideally , you should consider the kind of lunch eaten away from home in your general over-all nutrition picture . You 'll probably not get around to this for some time . But keep it in mind. ) // The Basic 7 to the rescue . At this point , with the meal patterns down , your mind may be a complete blank . ( There is lots of precedent for this ! ) But help is at hand in the Basic 7 ? the foods you must include in your meals every day . Try fitting them into your menu patterns . Just crossing out the word " fruit " and writing " orange , " for instance , will give you a sense of accomplishment which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And suppose your husband wo n't drink milk ? The milk you 'd put in a chocolate pudding ( the packaged kind , so easy to make ) counts in his pint . ( Yours , too ! ) Creamed soups , sauces , mashed potatoes , macaroni and cheese ? all require milk . Ilow nnich ? Fnough ? Sec how knowing you must use up a quart or whatever a day in your menus for sound nutrition sets your imagination sparking ? The same is true of all the other Basic 7 requirements ? they form an inspirational springboard for all your other menu planning . Consider the types of variety necessary in meals . Well you know you should n't repeat the same flavor ? as a tomato soup , tomato salad and tomato sauce ? in the same meal , or identical servings of the same food ( unless it is a great favorite ) on successive days . But have you considered the several other kinds of variety equally desirable ? Meals should be colorful . Even a delicious chicken presents a dull picture when accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pallid vanilla custard for dessert . But what a difference when the appetizer is tomato juice , the vegetables ? peas and carrots , the jelly ? cranberry , and chopped parsley adds a contrasting note to the potatoes ! Meals should be varied in texture and form . Could anything give you a more unsettled feeling faster than to have everything minced , diced , or chopped at the same meal ? A typical bad example would be ? diced fruit cup , hash , hashed brown potatoes , cole slaw , cubed carrots , Waldorf salad . Equally , everything creamy or swimming in gravy or sauce lacks appetite appeal . // There is an old saying that every meal should have one hot dish , if it is only the beverage . Variety of temperature is another menu need . In a dinner where the meat course is usually hot , this can be achieved by serving a chilled appetizer , salad and/or dessert with hot coffee . And for the sake of your digestion and figure , balance heavy foods with light . Too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your meat is a fatty one with a heavy gravy , compensate for it by serving a piquant non-fattening appetizer , a tart salad , and a light dessert . Weigh the purchasing possibilities of your budget . A weekly food budget of around $q or $io ( in normal times ) will permit a smart marketer to buy a total of a dozen different kinds of fruits and vegetables , if quantities are kept small ? no more than one pound of a vegetable ( except potatoes ) being bought , for instance . The same budget will permit one large cut of meat per week , with two or three other small ones , including fish . If your budget is less than this , plan to include more dried legumes and cereals , less eggs , meat , and expensive fruit . Consult market news items . Women 's pages of daily papers usually carry some kind of market bargain news . By watching these you can get lots of pointers . Some radio programs also give help along these lines . Suppose you learn asparagus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot asparagus , next day cold asparagrts both cooked at the same time ? and asparagus soup as a third poy , ibilit v.

( Buying " in season " food , rather than ? out of season , ? is always a good idea ? makes your budget cover more variety and brings each food to your table at its peak . Gradually build up a list of seasonal foods for yourself . ) Scan sample menus . Menus for the week or month , as given in daily papers and women 's magazines , are rich sources of inspiration . Notice how the same food is given a fresh treatment on second or third servings . You probably wo n't want // to follow any of the printed menus slavishly , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Especially the kind with menus or recipes attached . Go market window-shopping . Acquainting yourself with what the market offers in the way of food is a sound preliminary to shopping and meal planning . Keep a list of small twosome cuts of meat . Steaks , chops , sausages , liver , frankfurters , kidneys , tongue , and hamburgers are not the only kinds of meat available to families of two . There 's always the small chicken for roasting , frying , broiling , or fricasseeing ? with creamed chicken , minced chicken , cold chicken , chicken la king , chicken salad , and finally chicken soup as possibilities . ( No , not all from one little chicken ! ) A small pot roast of chuck or round steak , rolled , can be made into a very special twosome piece de resistance ? with second or third meal left-overs to count on . If your budget is up to it , you can always have a nice thick juicy steak rolled for roast beef ? or one prime rib rolled ! Learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as much protein , minerals , and vitamins as the more expensive cuts . Properly cooked , they can be very delicious . Someday when your butcher is not too busy , ask him about some of the economy cuts . In no time at all you 'll discover a whole new world of meat : swiss steaks , lamb shanks , pork shoulders , veal rump roasts , rolled shoulders , veal breasts , beef briskets , and dozens of others . Serve fish once a week . Fish has lots of virtues ? economy is one of them . It also is an excellent source of protein . Serve liver frequently . If you paid for meat according to its food value , liver would be " out of sight " for the average budget . Fortunately this is n't the case . Actually liver ? whether expensive calf liver , or the economical beef or pork liver ? is tremendously rich in both Vitamin A and iron . Plan top-of-the-stove or oven-cooked meals . Arranging your menus so that all cooked items can be cooked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It // cuts fuel bills too . Thinking in terms of the next day 's meals , planning to use left-over oven heat for a next day 's dish ? or for simultaneous cooking when the oven is on , arc two other economy tricks .

Just furling through the pages of a good cookbook will make you feel a lot wiser . MAKING YOUR SHOPPING LIST Once you have your menus tentatively complete , tested for nutrition against the Basic 7 , tested for variety in its several forms , with due consideration for your budget , it 's time to check the larder . When the cupboard is really bare . If you are literally starting from scratch , you will have to think through the cooking and serving of every item on your menus , and put their several requirements down on your list . This will include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt , " pepper for a " dash of pepper , " matches , rice , cornstarch , flour , sugar , baking powder ? the things you usually keep in stock on your shelves ? the staples . When the cupboard is not so bare . It still is good practice to think through the cooking and serving of every dish , but your shopping list will be confined usually to the non-staple items . You will probably form the habit of writing down on your future shopping list the name of any staple which begins to run low . If you are a long way from the stores , keeping duplicates of non-perishable staples and buying a replacement when you use one up , is sound practice . How much to buy ? If you " have set your heart on learning to be a smart housekeeper and use your left-overs wisely , you can do a little less worrying about buying in the exact quantity to be used up at one meal .

For meats you will roast : Buy around 3 pounds ? slightly more for chicken . This will allow for a " planned-over " meal . For meats you will pot-roast , stew , or boil : Buy around z pounds ? slightly more for chicken . Buy other meats according to your eye and the butcher 's advice . Make i pound-for-two a top figure for small meats . ( Whenever you see an unfamiliar kind of meat , ask about it .

If you buy a dozen oranges and you use two , three , or four per day , how long will they last ? The same for grapefruit , eggs , potatoes , cans of tomato juice , et cetera . How many loaves of bread will you cat ? I low much shortening , salad dressing , sugar , molasses , preserves ? Obviously , many of these questions are unanswerable by anyone except yourself ? and the best way for you to find the answers is to stock such foods in the sizes most convenient for you , and therr to see how long they last . Aid mow:to market ! 7 MARKETING ? and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital housekeeping skills which you will want to start cultivating promptly , if you are to get the most for your food dollars both in nutrition and mealtime enjoyment . Be a " wise " buyer . That old , fundamental , big-badwolf law of business , caveat e7nptor , meaning " let the buyer beware , " holds especially true in marketing . Your butcher , baker , and candlestick maker are all businessmen ? in business to make a profit . Each may consider himself honest ? within the law . On the other hand , each may have a few little profit-increasing tricks which are far from ethical bur which you can tcard against , once you have been warned . In any event , it is n't the storekeeper 's job to make sure you get the most for your money . That 's your job . He will always have some merchandise which is " tops " and some which is n't . To stay in business , and to make a profit , he usually has to sell both kinds at the same /trice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be aide to recognize it when you see it . Then you can demand it . Do 's AND DON'T 'S OF MARKETING Asyouu progess with your marketing you will learn to stay away from the merchant who has dubious selling practices ? if you are in a locality where you can exercise choice in the IOI // matter . If not , you will have to become a smart marketer quickly . The following pointers apply to marketing with the ethical as well as the unethical . Read them over before starting on your first marketing expedition . Always ask the price first . Perhaps you are just naturally a good trader and would n't think of committing yourself without asking the price first . But the world is full of brides and others who begin their ordering by saying , " ? I 'd like some nice fresh peas . . . and carrots . . . and lettuce . . . . " All of which permits the dealer to do some very fancy jockeying of prices as he tallies your bill . It 's much sounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . . . your carrots . . . your lettuce ? " Then you can decide immediately whether they are in line with your budget , and can order in a real businesslike way , knowing exactly how much each pound , bunch , et cetera will cost . How much for the dealer 's thumb ? Some dealers have notoriously valuable thumbs . Butchers especially . Always watch the scales as your purchases are being weighed . Be sure the dealer 's hand is removed completely from the food itself , the bag , or anything touching the scales before the weight is determined . Be sure , too , a vibrating index comes to a dead stop . ( A small , accurate scale at home is very desirable for rechecking . ) Be smart about grades . Ask for " First Grade " not " Grade A " or " No. r quality " merchandise , unless you know just exactly what you are doing . The whole grading and standardization picture is a confused one . Only some few types of merchandise must be graded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The United States Government has established grades for certain things such as meat , eggs , dairy products , canned fruits and vegetables ? but the manufacturer or processor can put these grade marks on his labels , or not , pretty much as he chooses .

Note where " No. i " and " Grade A " occur in some of these . // 1 04 Making Housekeeping Easy of the fourth ? are approximately the same ; their appearance differences can be minimized by the manner of your handling . For instance , it would be a waste of money to buy " Fancy , " matched-in-size peaches , if you are going to chop them up anyway for fruit cup .

Do n't be hoodwinked into believing it is always cheaper to buy the large size . It is n't . Even on a purely price basis , it frequently is n't . Dented cans are sometimes sold at bargain prices , simply for appearance reasons . The food in such cans is still perfect . But never buy or eat from a swollen or bulging can ! These are indications that the food inside is bad ? poisonous ! Seeing is not always believing . You may think you are buying a large box of breakfast food , only to find it about half full when you open it . This is known as a " slack fill " and is akin to the use of false bottom containers , deceptively shaped bottles and other sly tricks of the trade . Your best protection , again , is to buy by net weight . Watch your labels , too , for such words as " imitation , " " synthetic , " " pectin added , " " artificially colored , " or any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the top quality its name and advertising might indicate . How often to shop . Even though you have made your menus up for the week ? and you wouldould like to be a weekly shopper ? such things as lack of storage space may force you to market more frequently . It 's false economy to have to throw away spoiled food ? no matter how great a bargain it was to start with . And a crowded refrigerator is an inefficient one . Air must circulate around the food in a refrigerator if it is to be preserved properly . Crowded dry storage bins also result in wastage . If you find for storage-space reasons that you must shop more than once a vcck , try to become a bi-weekly shopper . Never fall into the habit of going to the stores every day . That is a terrific waste of tune and energy . What 's Good Today ? 1o5 Small versus large stores . A large turnover means fresher merchandise . On the other hand , the small merchant may give you valuable personal service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether such personal attention compensates . Shop and carry . Shopping where you have to carry your own purchases is always more economical than shopping where delivery service is maintained . This , too , must be a personal decision . Contrary to some thinking , the cash-and-carry stores offer the same qualities of merchandise obtainable in all but the luxury small shops . Shop early . Produce is fresh , clerks are fresh ( in the vitality sense ) , limited supplies are available in the morning . Also , perishable foods spend less time out of the refrigerator if you buy them early and put them away immediately upon returning home , thus preserving their vitamin and mineral values . Shop in person . By going to the markets yourself you can see exactly what you are getting ? and choose the best available .

Instinctively a butcher respects a buyer who knows quality when she sees it , so it is to your advantage to become such a buyer . Government standards .

You 'll find that sifting first onto waxed paper , then transferring this to your measuring cup , then sifting back to the waxed paper or mixing bowl , on easy way . Always level off in measuring . Recipes which call for one spoonful or cupful , mean one level spoonful or cupful . Always level off with a knife or spatula after dipping your spoon or cup into the sugar , for instance , and bringing it out heaping . Graduated sets of spoons are easiest . Some large measuring spoons are marked with half- or quarter-spoonful outlines . Accuracy is easier with a set of spoons .

Every meat recipe , no matter how involved it sounds , is some variation of these . Broiling . This is the good old " steak and chop " process with which you may be familiar . Just preheat the broiler of your oven to the desired temperature . ( See the Timetable for Broiling , keeping in mind that all timetables are only approximate . ) Place steak , chops , or whatever , on the broiling rack three inches from the flame . If closer , reduce the heat . When the top side of the meat is done , salt it before turning it over . ( Salt the second side after it , too , is done . ) Serve on a hot platter . If you do n't have a thermometer for testing oven temperatures ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following rune-honored way : Who Said " Bride 's Cooking " ? 131 Timetable for Broiling This timetable is based on broiling at a moderate temperature ( 35o ? F. ) . Rare steaks are broiled to an internal temperature of 13o ? F. ; medium to 16o ? F. Lamb chops are broiled to 17o ? F. Ham is cooked well done . The time for broiling bacon is influenced by personal preference as to crispness. 13 2 Making Housekeeping Easy Timetable for Broiling ? Continued Roasting . This method takes longer , but is also very easy on the cook . First light your oven and set the temperature control at 300 ? or 35o ? F. according to the roasting timetable for that particular cut of meat . ( Allowing ten minutes for the oven to heat is about right . ) Place the meat in an uncovered pan , fat side up , and without increasing or decreasing the temperature cook until done . ( A meat thermometer inserted to its bulb in the thickest part of the lean meat , is the best way to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " doneness . " ) Do not " flour . " Do not add water . Do not baste . You may season with . // salt and pepper either before or after roasting . ( Notice no men tion is made of " searing . " Searing is now frowned upon . ) Roasting variations . Rolled roasts which have no bones of their own to stand on ( like a standing roast ! ) should be placed on a rack and turned every half hour . Veal , which has little fat of its own , is improved by rubbing with fat or " larding . " Pork and home-cured hams should be soaked overnight before cooking ... " bake " is the term usually applied to ham roasting . ( To glaze a ham , remove the rind after baking , cover with brown sugar and return to the oven to brown. ) // // Pan-broiling .

Excess fat should be poured off , lest the meat be " fried " rather than broiled . Do not add water . ( No timetable is practical for pan-broiling . ) Frying . Cooking in a small amount of fat is sometimes called sauteing ? instead of simply frying . Both mean the same . Cooking in deep fat is French frying . In both kinds of frying , meat is usually coated with flour and/or dipped in egg and crumbs before being browned in the fat . After the initial brown ing , the fire is lowered until the meat is done . Cooking uncov ered results in a crisp crust . Cooking covered ( really braising ) results in a soft exterior . ( No timetable is practical for frying . ) Braising . This involves browning the meat in a little hot fat , covering and cooking slowly in juices from the meat ? with a little water ( usually ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or breaded with egg and crumbs before browning . Braising can be done on the top of the stove , or in the oven . A heavy skillet or kettle with a tight-fitting cover is de sirable for this type of cooking . Seasoning can be done to advan tage before adding the liquid . A rack under the meat if a pot roast ? will prevent its getting too well done on t he bot t onl. ' funn ing is required in all kinds of braising for even cooling . 1 36 Making Housekeeping Easy Cooking in water . In technical circles , this one term is now used to cover stewing ? the cooking of small pieces of meat in water ? and what was previously called simmering ? the cook ing of large pieces of meat in water , as when you cook a ham . The cooking temperatures in both cases should be kept just below the boiling point . // IF IT 'S STILL " STEW " TO YOU . . .

Add vegetables just far enough ahead of serving time to permit their getting done . A variety of colorful vegetables adds interest to any stew . You make the gravy by thickening the liquid left after the vegetables and meat have been removed to a hot platter . ( If you can make dumplings , here 's the perfect spot- for them ! ) For a light stew , follow the same procedure as for a brown stew ? just eliminate the browning . WHAT 'S A MEAT PIE ?
