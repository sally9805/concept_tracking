The Supreme Court this week upheld the right of foremen under the Wagner Act to organize for collective bargaining . Said Justice Jackson for the 5-to-4 majority : though the foremen 's interests lie with management in maintaining production , they may be opposed when it comes to fixing wages , hours and working conditions . Therefore , foremen must be allowed " collective action to protect their collective interests . " <P> Under this decision , snapped Justice Douglas in vigorous dissent , " if a union of vice presidents apply for recognition as a collective bargaining agency , I do not see how we could deny it . "
