Out of a four-and-a-half-year reorganization last week came what was left of the late Clarence Mackay 's Postal Telegraph communications system . <P> The old Postal system had two main units : the " Land Line System , " with a domestic telegraph business , and a cable and radio system to Europe and Latin America . In 1928 , Clarence Mackay decided that music was a more interesting medium of communication , sold the system to International Telephone &; Telegraph . By June 1935 , I. T. &; T. was fed up with advancing Postal cash to pay the $2,500,000-a-year interest on its bonds , let it slip into 77-B . Largest independent bondholder : Lehman Bros , ( and clients ) , whose Bondholders Committee finally represented some $30,000,000 ( about 60% ) of the bonds . <P> Upshot of the reorganization is two new companies : Postal Telegraph , Inc. , which gets the land lines , and American Cable &; Radio Corp. , a holding company , which gets the old radio and cable lines ( induding I. T. &; T. 's South American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be owned by I. T. &; T. , one-third by bondholders in the old Postal . Traffic contracts will link Postal 's land lines to the international network . <P> As for the new Postal , it is now free of I. T. &; T. control , owned by its former bondholders . In exchange for ceding its cable and radio properties to A. C. &; R. these former bondholders also acquired first call on A. C. &; R. 's earnings in the form of $9,210,632 of its subsidiaries ' debentures . Another $3,293,562 of debentures went to I. T. &; T. <P> What old Postal bondholders ( or I. T. &; T. ) will get out of the deal depends on A. C. &; R. 's subsidiaries . At an earnings level before interest and taxes of around $1,500,000 ( about 30% above their combined earnings for 1939 ) I. T. &; T. 's two-thirds stock interest in A. C. &; R. gives it a better return than Postal bondholders , who have the larger bond interest . As for the Postal bondholders ' interest in the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land lines can work a miracle , stay out of the red . Main obstacle : a big competitor , Western Union , has had lean years too , the amount of business ( badly nicked by telephone and airmail competition ) probably can not support two profitable systems . <P> President of the new Postal is a tall , smooth ex-accountant named Edwin F. Chinlund , who twice in his career has been a partner in Arthur Andersen &; Co. ( auditors ) , in between was vice president and comptroller of I. T. &; T. Chinlund 's immediate job will be to compete more aggressively with big , hungry Western Union . But the long and more complicated end of his assignment is negotiating with Western Union , investors , labor and Washington for a merger of the two sickish systems into one with a better chance of making money .
