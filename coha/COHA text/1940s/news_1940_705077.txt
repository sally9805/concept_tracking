txt Steel companies are expected to steady their buying of iron and steel scrap as a result of recent conferences with the National Defense Advisory Commission . Representatives of the steel industry and the scrap iron and steel dealers assured the defense commission at conferences here that there is no justification for any runaway price development or any occasion for concern over securing adequate supplies for the defense program . Meanwhile , Defense Commissioner Leon Henderson issued a formal statement saying that the conferences had shown that " prices for scrap should not exceed and might be lower than the present level " even if , , steel activity increases . Reason for the recent scrap price rises was said by Mr. Henderson to be that " certain steel makers suddenly appeared as buyers in territories from which they formerly had not drawn . " He said that the conference of steel makers , scrap dealers and government officials had agreed on this point . To help smooth out prices in the future , steel companies are expected to buy scrap as it is offered , adding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of new steel . This steady buying should prevent sharp drops in scrap prices and the accumulation of stocks will tend to discourage sharp advances . " Withholding and speculation can be eliminated as a factor affecting scrap prices , " Mr. Henderson predicted , adding that the conference had agreed that , " If buying is orderly . there is nothing on the demand side which would warrant rising price . " Further efforts in this direction will be made at another conference " in the immediate future " and at a meeting with the principal makers of scrap , including the railroads and metal working industries . One of the principal problems in insuring an adequate supply of scrap is to obtain it from centers beyond the normal collection areas and to make this available in the consuming centers . The Defense Advisory Commission is now making studies to accomplish this result . The indications are that the necessary supplies will be available at prices not out of line with those prevailing in previous years in which large quantities were in demand .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
