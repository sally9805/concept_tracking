Geologists , newsmen and stockbrokers were beating a path last week to the tent flaps of a prospector named Robert Campbell , on the chilly shore of Lake Superior . Seventy miles north of Sault Ste. Marie , he had just staked out Canada 's newest uranium discovery . Even cautious officials in Canada 's Department of Mines thought that his samples looked like " very high-quality ore . " <P> Campbell was not the first to find uranium north of the Soo . In 1847 , U.S. copper prospectors had come across uranium . Because uranium was useless at the time , they mentioned their find only vaguely in reports that lay moldering in Toronto libraries until Campbell looked them up last year . <P> Last spring , 34-year-old Bob Campbell set out to rediscover the old strike . He formed a syndicate , raised $4,000 , bought a boat and some Geiger counters . With two other prospectors he started probing his way along the rocky lake shore . In a whole summer of crawling into every cove and climbing 1,000-ft. cliffs , the trio covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . The others gave up but Campbell stayed , got another boat and went on alone . Ten miles farther on , at a place called Alona Bay , his Geiger counter buzzed wildly . A two-inch seam of uranium-bearing pitchblende stood out on the shoreline rock . Said Campbell : " I suddenly wanted to shout to the whole world . " <P> Campbell stayed quiet long enough to stake 30 claims . Another prospector , Norbert Miller of Toronto , saw him staking , guessed what was up . As the word spread along what prospectors call " the moccasin trail , " the rush started . In no time 500 claims had been staked around Campbell 's . When Campbell 's ore samples showed a 60% content of radioactive mineral and 99% of it uranium ( 10% is considered pay dirt ) , the boom went skyhigh . <P> Last week , government atomic experts were hoping it would all turn out to be as good as it looked . The new find is only two miles from a highway , and is right on the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant Eldorado , in the Northwest Territories , Canada 's only proved source of uranium . Toronto investors were willing to bet big money that the new strike was the real thing . By week 's end , shares in Campbell 's syndicate , which he peddled last spring for $25 apiece , were bringing bids of $1,000 . Prospector Campbell and his backers were not selling .
