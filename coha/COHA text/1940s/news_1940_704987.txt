txt Five more sleek gray destroyers of the United States Navy , headed for Canadian waters and ultimately sea duty for Britain , churned slowly down Boston Harbor today , following the course taken by three other fighting ships of the same class which slipped out of the " roads " at 6:30 last night . Without demonstration , the Herndon and the Welles weighed anchor shortly after 8 a. m. , and headed out to sea , and at 12:45 , after signs of unusual activity in Charlestown Navy Yard and much going and coming of subsidary vessels , the U. S. S. Crowinshield cast off mooring lines and headed out . She was followed at brief intervals by the W. C. Wood and the Buchanan , which was tied up yesterday near the old frigate Constitution . There remains now at the yard only the destroyer Mackenzie , which arrived today and which apparently was headed for dry-dock overhaul this afternoon . With the Herndon and Welles went the U. S. S. Russell , a new type of destroyer known as a " destroyer leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities in the ships-forbases trade . On board was said to be . Rear Admiral F. L. Reichmuth , Commander of the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Squadron , who arrived at the Yard last night . He is understood to be accompanying the first delivery of destroyers in order to supervise their transfer to representatives of the - Royal Navy . Departure of the ships and even identification by name and number was made a matter of " no comment " by officials at Charlestown Navy Yard . On orders from Washington they will not give out information on the movement of the vessels being checked here as a part of the 50 given to Great Britain , presumably for convoy service , in return for naval and air bases in the Caribbean and at points in the North Atlantic in this hemisphere . Newsmen , in the absence of direct information from the Yard , therefore are checking the shifting of the four-stackers from Custom House tower , commanding the harbor .
