txt By a unanimous voice vote , the Senate passed and sent to the White House today a bill to extend the LendLease Act for another year from June 30 , after Vice President Truman , casting his first vote as presiding officer , broke a 39-39 tie to clinch the defeat of a Republicansponsored amendment which would have prohibited the President from contracting for the use of the program for post-war relief , rehabilitation or reconstruction , even through the sale of materials to the governments using them . Thirty-four Republicans , four Democrats and one Progressive voted for the restriction , presented by Senator Taft of Ohio . Thirtyseven Democrats and two Republicans opposed it . " The vote , " said the Vice President with a smile , " is 39 to 39 . The chair votes No . " Under Senate Nies , the tie vote was sufficient to kill the amendment . Langer Amendment Also Beaten A second amendment , offered by Senator Langer , Republican , of North Dakota , which would have banned further lend-lease shipments , of farm machinery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came immediately . The measure thus was sent to the President in precisely the fdrm in which the House passed it March 13 . In that chamber , too , the issue of disposal of billions of dollars ' worth of lend-lease materials after hostilities ceased was raised . However , Republican members of the Foreign Affairs Committee , led by Representative Vorys of Ohio , effected a compromise with the majority . Under it , it was provided that nothing in the extended act should be construed to authorize the President to enter into or carry out any contract or agreement with a foreign Government for post-war relief , rehabilitation or reconstruction , but with an exception . This was that in a contract or agreement entered into under the act in which the United States undertook to furnish to a foreign Government defense articles , services or information for use in the prosecution of the war and which provided for their disposition , on terms and conditions of sale prescribed by the President , these would " not be deemed to be for post-war relief , post-war rehabilitation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment proposed to strike out the exception to which the House Republicans had agreed . Although there had been no question about extending the lendlease program , it was evident from the beginning of the contest over the Taft amendment yesterday that this vote would be close . At times when debate focused on sweeping delegations of Congressional power and demands for Congressional control over expenditures and other aids to post-war reconstruction abroad , it was predicted that the Taft proposal would be adopted . Early in today 's debate Senator Tydings , Democrat , of Maryland , called for " an end to the blank check era as soon as this war is over . " " I have signed many blank checks to win this war , " Mr. TydContinued ings said , " but I do not want to sign any for the post-war era . " Demanding " a complete and comprehensive picture of what is contemplated as our share in the rehabilitation of the world , " Senator La Follette , Progressive , of Wisconsin , said that he would support the Taft proposal " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before making commitments for post-war aid to war-torn countries . " " We will never get this picture , or complete and comprehensive determination of the extent to which we are to participate if we give exclusive control over commitments to the executive agencies , " Mr. LaFollette said . Senator Vandenberg , Republican of Michigan , asserted that he did not like the " implications " of the recently announced $2,500,000,000 agreement with France . " It indicates , " he added , " that it is intended to carry over into the post-war period . " It never was the intention of Congress , said Senator Barkley , majority leader , as he took up the Administration 's fight against the Taft amendment , to use lend-lease for post-war reconstruction , rehabilitation or relief . Mr. Roosevelt , he recalled , emphasized that in his annual message to Congress . " But , " Mr. Barkley continued , 1 " lend-lease has put vast quantities of materials all over the world for the prosecution of the war . It is worth billions and billions of dollars . What are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is , haul it back to this country and pile it up to compete with production here ? " There is no proposal here to lend ; lease or give away any of these vast stocks for post-war reconstruction , relief , or rehabilitation in any foreign country . It is proposed instead , to sell it . " If any materials are retained by a Government now using them , they are to be paid for . Of all these vast quantities of equipment and materials abroad when the war is ended , every pound will belong to the United States Government . We will have the choice of selling it overseas at the best terms obtainable , bringing it back here , or letting it lie undisturbed or stored to deteriorate . " If sales were to be made , Senator Wherry , Republican of Nebraska , argued , disposals should be made through the Surplus War Property Board , " not left to the discretion of the President . " The Taft amendment , said Senator George , Democrat of Georgia , would strike from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original act , that provision was necessary for contract settlements .
