It was a week of decision . <P> The Prime Minister was deadly serious ; no colloquialisms spiced the earnest , careful , 10,000-word speech in which he asked Parliament to support Canada 's participation in the World Security Conference at San Francisco .

Member after member rose to support the Prime Minister .
