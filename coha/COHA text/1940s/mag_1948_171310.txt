As an expert in classifying insects , burly , Hoboken-born Alfred Charles Kinsey had 150,000 specimens available for studying a single species of wasp . As professor of zoology at Indiana University , he found no similar bank of scientific data to help answer his students ' questions about the sexual behavior of human beings ; the most detailed study of sex histories covered only 300 individuals . Nine years ago Kinsey , doctor of science ( Harvard ) and author of half a dozen textbooks ( e.g. , New Introduction to Biology ) set out to even the scientific score . <P> This week , after months of excited drum-beating by science writers , Kinsey published some findings , in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male ( W. B. Saunders Co. ; $6.50 ) . *Kinsey , father of three children , insists that the 804-page work is " a report on what people do , which raises no question of what they should do . " <P> So far Scientist Kinsey and his assistants have gathered 12,214 case histories of U.S. men , women &; children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 more years they expect to spend on the study , + he and his associates will add 88,000 histories , publish eight other volumes . Their first book is based on interviews with 5,300 white males . Answers were recorded in code to avoid embarrassment , and tabulation by punch cards made the work easier . <P> Criminals , clergymen , clerks , teachers , students , prison inmates , men of various types and ages were interviewed and urged to tell all . As a result of the tabulated testimony , Kinsey concludes that 85% of the total U.S. male population has premarital intercourse ; nearly 70% has relations with prostitutes ; between 30% and 45% has extra-marital intercourse ; 37% has some homosexual experience between adolescence and old age , with the highest rate among single males 36 to 40 . <P> Class View . Sex behavior , Kinsey reports , seems to have a class angle . There is no " American pattern " of sexual behavior according to his findings ; instead , there are differences as great as anthropologists find between the sexual patterns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. differences correspond roughly to educational levels . Many men who have gone to college , he finds , have kissed dozens of girls , had intercourse with none ; but among males of lower educational levels , there is more intercourse , less petting . <P> In general , males of the upper levels feel that lower-level morality lacks " ideals " while the lower level feels that the college-level group is artificial and insincere in its sexual behavior-and what is worse , tries to force its patterns on others . Says Kinsey : " Legends about the immorality of the lower level are matched by legends about the perversions of the upper level . "
