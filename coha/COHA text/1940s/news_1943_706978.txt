txt ALBANY , Feb. 14 ? Developments in the two weeks between Governor Dewey 's submission of the State budget and the public hearing to be held on it tomorrow in the Assembly Chamber have tended to bolster the belief that the Governor has . underestimated his prospective surplus by at least $25,000,000 , or 5D per cent . The Governor , in his budget , looked for a $50,000,000 State surplus at the end of the fiscal year for which he is budgeting , that is , from April 1 , 1943 , to March 31 , 1944 . Analysis of his own figures indicates a minimum surplus of $75,000,000 , barring a complete change in the domestic economy in the next twelve months . Following are some of the developments : 1 ? The Governor estimated that auto license fees would be only $20,000,000 for the nine months ending this coming April 1 . Motor Vehicle Commissioner Splain disclosed in New York City yesterday that registrations have been 70 per cent of ? normal in number , which means $26,000,000 even if the reduced registration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestionably higher percentage of commercial cars , which pay heavier fees , is ignored . This is a minimum increase of $6,000,000 over the Governor 's surplus on hand as of this April 1 , and is carried over into the 1943-44 fiscal picture . Race-Track Yield a Factor 2 ? The Governor , admitting a trend of $13,200,000 a year in parimutuel revenues on the basis of betting at race tracks in the last six months of the 1942 calendar year , cut this to $7,500,000 at first , and then knocked off half of that , leaving $3,750,000 as his estimate of net racing revenue . He did this with the knowledge that there was no absolute ban on racing in the picture , but that revenues might be cut by transportation difficul'ties . Rubber Administrator Jeffers 's letter this week confirmed the " noban " idea about racing , and the prospects are definite that all // DEWEY SAID TO ERR ON STATE SURPLUS // tracks reachable by subway and normal transportation devices will remain open . This means the closing of Saratoga , and racing instead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase , rather than a decrease , in parimutuel revenues , since the " subway " tracks produce a " handle " several times the daily average at remote , and wealthier , Saratoga . While the details of August racing in New York eity are still to be worked out , they will be , and the Governor 's projected loss of nearly $10,000,000 in racing revenues does not appear in the picture . Highway Funds Involved 3 ? The Democrats in the Legislature unearthed the fact this week that the Governor had appropriated $5,000,000 additional for highway construction in the new of last budget , while re-appropriating most of last year 's $6,200,000 , very little of which was spent , and of which there is virtually no prospect of spending any in the coming year . He thus increased his " reserve " for the future by at least $5,000,000. 4 ? The Governor allotted $7,500 , - 000 in his fiscal plan for appropriations by the Legislature over and above his budget in the next two months . This usually runs about $2,000,000 and even with appropriations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police , not more than $3,500,000 will be spent , leaving another reserve of $4,000,000 . In addition to all these items , which add up to roughly $25,000 , - 000 , there is another item of anywhere from $4,000,000 to $7,000 , - 000 in which the Governor is believed by budget students to have erred , on the conservative side . This is the item of " lapse , " or moneys appropriated for various purposes , mostly salary and maintenance , which sums are not spent during the year for which they are appropriated . The Governor estimated these " lapses " at $6,500,000 for the nine-month fiscal period ending April 1 , and $6,000,000 for the 1943-44 fiscal year . Actually , the lapses for the ninemonth period may run above $10 , - 000,000 and those for the full twelve-month fiscal year coming up may run much higher . When the State has 5,000 vacancies on its payroll , and other jobs are being abolished , the lapses must run higher than the Governor figured , and the financial benefit to the State will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tax-Cut Demands Looming The effect of all this is expected to be threefold : First , it will lead to demands for increased tax cuts at tomorrow 's budget hearing , although the hearing is expected to be far more routine than in the past few years when the taxpayers ' groups came with hopes of persuading a Legislature of a different political complexion from that of the Governor to cut the Governor 's budget as submitted . Second , it will bolster the demands from school authorities , and sentiment among a number of members of the Legislature , for " pegging " State aid for education at last year 's level , instead of permitting the automatic reduction which comes with a declining school attendance . The Democrats will vote as a bloc for pegging State aid , and will have some Republican support . Third , it will fortify the Democrats in their demands that the 25 per cent cut in the income tax , instituted last year , be made a 33 1-3 per cent cut this year . With all these developments , Governor Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats admit that he is playing the game the " smart way . " First of all , he has behind him his theory that good times financially for the State are the times in which to build up a surplus , and not cut taxes , so that deficits can be avoided later on , along with tax increases . Tax increases or borrowings in depression years serve to prolong the depression , he is understood to contend . " Inherited " a State Surplus The Governor will enjoy the political benefit of having theoretically inherited a surplus of only $41,000,000 on April 1 of this year and of having boosted it to $75,000,000 or- $80,000,000 by the end of his first year in office , which , coincidentally , will usher in the Presidential campaign year of 1944 . Mr. Dewey took that course deliberately in the preparation of the new budget when he decided to curtail the Lehman budget to a nine-month budget , in changing the date of the fiscal year , rather than to submit . a nine-month budget of his own to accomplish . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the Lehman surplus from showing on the books of the State . ? governmentally , Mr. Dewey is regarded as justified in making the fiscal year change at the earliest possible date , in order to accomplish quarterly installment payments of the income tax at once , and put the State more nearly on a cash basis from year to year .
