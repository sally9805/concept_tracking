( See Cover ) Postwar planners for whom only the sky is the limit serve a great purpose . They point to the truth that Peace on this planet is indivisible . They reflect the foresight-and the insight-that some day ( 100 or 1,000 years from now ) the human race is likely to order its affairs as one big family , happy or quarrelsome . <P> But planners whose eyes dwell too much on the far horizons of things must be balanced by those who , in the American phrase , " keep their eye on the ball . " The ball in this instance is postwar employment-or unemployment . And currently the keenest sight on that ball is being stimulated by the Committee for Economic Development . <P> C.E.D. will be a year old this week . Its chairman , Paul Gray Hoffman , 52 , has been president of Studebaker Corp . for eight years , has led other mass movements in business . But none has approached the size of C.E.D. 's job . C.E.D. is working on the assumption that private industry can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war than it did in 1940 , and thereby employ at least 20% more workers than in that fat year . <P> The Plan . The Hoffman-C.E.D. idea is to start at the grass roots of private enterprise-with the nation 's 2,000,000 employers ( 90% of whom employ less than , eight men ) - and see what can be done about arranging for this production and this employment . If enough businessmen will do their smart part , the sum total may equal the beyond-the-horizon frontier toward which U.S. hopes are directed . <P> So C.E.D. has embarked on 1 ) a nationwide sales job ( with a Field Division ) ; 2 ) an ambitious study project ( with a Research Division ) . But the most important thing about C.E.D. is that , however big it sounds , the job it has taken on is strictly confined to what business can reasonably be expected to do on its own hook . If C.E.D. achieves its limited objective-and that is still , of necessity , a big if-U.S. businessmen can truthfully say that they have done all that businessmen can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversely , probably the greatest danger facing C.E.D. is that , in evangelizing employers with the " business can do it ' ' point of view , it may mesmerize too many citizens into thinking that C.E.D. 's slogan is " business can do it alone . " Paul Hoffman 's job is to see to it that business does its utmost without appearing to assume responsibility for more than it can be expected to deliver . <P> Who is Paul Hoffman ? Paul Gray Hoffman is a mild-mannered , mildly good-looking , nonsmoking , teetotaling gentleman of medium size , whose most distinctive feature is a pair of startlingly blue eyes . He is a friendly family man with a bustling , buxom wife , five sons-all in uniform today-and two daughters . He works in South Bend , Ind . and spends his meager spare time at home-in the winter in a " mildly exclusive " part of South Bend ; in the summer at unpretentious Lakeside , on Lake Michigan . <P> His one " vice " is that he loves to gamble - on golf ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he plays even better ) , on poker , on almost anything . His favorite tactic is to double his bets until he wins .
