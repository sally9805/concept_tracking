WALT WHITMAN . POET OF DEMOCRACY-Hugh l'Anson Faussef-Yale ( $3 ) . <P> This compact , brilliant critical biography is 1 ) an excellent life of Walt Whitman , 2 ) a just , if merciless , evaluation of him as poet , mystic and prophet of democracy , 3 ) an arduous , provocative sermon on the nature and responsibility of democracy and of art . Unlike most Whitman critics , Author Fausset avoids the extremes of most books about Whitman . He neither damns nor admires Whitman for being a homosexual . He does not claim that Whitman 's poetry is as great as Homer 's or merely a free verse Sears , Roebuck catalogue . He simply tries to explain what Whitman achieved in poetry and mysticism , what he failed to achieve-and why . <P> Critic Fausset 's thesis is simple : if Whitman was a great poet , it was his business to fulfill the responsibilities of one . If he was the evangelist of democracy , it was his business to write a true , not a heretical , gospel . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either poet or evangelist . He wrote some great poetry and some amazingly energetic verse . But on the whole , he shrank even from such responsibilities as he was equipped to recognize . He perceived a great number of democratic half-truths . He lacked the intellectual equipment or spiritual stamina to make the half-truth whole . Reason : Whitman , the man , was never really whole . <P> Bisexual . All human beings , Critic Fausset observes , are to some extent bisexual . But Whitman had a great deal more of the woman in him than men normally have . This schism in his nature , Fausset believes , was in part the source of such greatness as he had . It was also the chief source of his failures . Whitman 's femininity gave him his tremendous powers for the passive absorption of experience , for sympathy , for the almost bottomless endurance ( as in the Civil War hospitals ) of massive suffering . But it also accounts for the sentimentality , effusiveness , extreme over-assertiveness , pseudo-masculinity and egoism of many of his poems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , in all probability , he never felt normal sexual desire in his life , his hunger for the easy comradeship of simple men developed . " More intent on excluding none than on wholely finding one , " it was inevitable that he should remain innocent to the end of his days of psychology , character , the true nature of individualism , personality , tragedy , evil-all of which considerably complicate the problems of the poet and of the democratic theorist .
