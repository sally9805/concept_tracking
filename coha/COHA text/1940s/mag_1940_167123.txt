While digging into the wars of long-dead peoples , it is annoying to archeologists to be bothered by the wars of the living . The University of Chicago 's famed Oriental Institute has an expedition now at work in Tell Fakhariyeh in northern Syria , a great mound ( tell means mound ) which they suppose to be the site of a city that nourished 1,500 years B. c. , and which later was a walled Roman camp . With World War II continually threatening the eastern Mediterranean , the diggers-Dr . <P> Calvin W. McEwan , Mrs. McEwan and Harold D. Hill-had a good deal of trouble just getting visas to reach the site . After they got there they were officially advised to go home . When they decided to stay and cabled Chicago for funds , officials shrugged , obligingly transmitted the cable without further ado . In the message they also dolefully revealed that at the top of the mound , which they had to cut through , were the remains of some 70.000 human bodies , apparently buried there after fighting or massacres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no less than twelve expeditions probing the rich antiquities of the Near East , and its director , the late , great James Henry Breasted , scurried around from camp to camp by airplane . Now in this area the Institute has only one expedition , the McEwan party at Tell Fakhariyeh . War is not the only reason for this ; another reason is diminished income . <P> Dr. John Albert Wilson , the Institute 's young ( 40 ) , affable director who suc ceeded Dr. Breasted , explained last week that the Institute used to get fat annual appropriations from the Rockefellers ' General Education Board . In 1936 the Board , which had started to distribute its capital gave the Institute a final lump-sum endowment of $2,000,000 . The Institute has since been operating mostly on the income from this , which amounts to about a third of the former yearly grants . Few other U. S. diggers are working the war-clouded Near East . The Boston Museum of Fine Arts , however , has a party at Gizeh in Egypt , where it has labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other treasures the gold-cased furniture of Queen Hetep heres I. The American Schools of Oriental Research have a party on the site of King Solomon 's ancient Red Sea port ( TIME , May 30 , 1938 ) and an expedition based at Bagdad which is making a prehistoric survey of North Syria and Iraq . All these archeologists have to be ready to jump at the first crack of a cannon .
