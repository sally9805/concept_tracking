txt WASHINGTON , Oct. 10 ? Thurman Arnold , Assistant Attorney General in charge of anti-trust prosecutions , has warned the Federal Works Agency that denial of a contract to the Currier Lumber Company of Detroit , low bidder for 300 defense houses in Michigan , might require action on the part of the Department of Justice . Mr. Arnold , in a brief letter to John M. Carmody , FWA Administrator , is understood to have asserted that he saw no reason why Mr. Carmody should hesitate to award the contract to the Currier company , which was the low bidder by about $400,000 . He termed the case similar to others that the department has prosecuted for violation of the anti-trust laws . Department of Justice officials declined to comment on Mr. Arnold 's letter or to explain how the A. F. of L. might be affected . It was pointed out , however , that the A. F. of L. had threatened to call a strike on construction work in Michigan if the housing contract was given to the Currier company , which builds pre-fabricated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Carmody has withheld giving the contract to the Currier company , it was said , because of instructions given by Sidney Hillman , Associate Director General of the Office of Production Management , in charge of the OPM 's Labor Division . The Congress of Industrial Organization charges that Mr. Hillman 's attitude is the result of a stabilization agreement with American Federation of Labor unions , which they claim gives the A. F. of L. a monopoly of defense construction . - " Lewis Enters Controversy John L. Lewis , president of the United Mine Workers , entered the controversy today for the second time in forty-eight hours . He sent a telegram to Senator Truman , chairman of the defense investigating committee , charging that the // ARNOLD MAY ACT IN CURRIER CASE // " Hillman stabilization agreement " had granted a monopoly to the A. F. L. , calling the action " outrageous " and demanding that all those connected with the agreement and the Currier case be subpoenaed . Earlier he had urged Administrator Carmody to grant the Currier company the contract . Richard Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Construction Trades Department , in his first statement on the Currier case , said that the A. F. of L. opposition to the Currier contract was not offered because the plans provided for pre-fabricated houses . The A. F. of L. building unions , according to Mr. Gray have built pre-fabricated houses at Rahway and Camden , N. J. Asserting that the actual difference between Mr. Currier 's bid and his nearest competitor was really $216,000 and not $400,000 , Mr. Gray said that the A. F. of L. objected to Mr. Currier receiving the contract solely because of his past labor policies . He said that Mr. Currier was really in the building supply business and that low wages paid by him would permit him to create a monopoly or force his competitors to the same methods in order to meet his competition . The A. F. of L. official maintained that the stabilization agreement would be of no benefit to the A. F. of L. if Mr. Currier 's alleged anti-labor policy prevailed in the Detroit area . C.

The resolutions will be based on the failure of the Federal Works Agency , upon order of Mr. Hillman , to grant the Currier Company contract . The Truman Committee it was said will probably enlarge its request for witnesses and will not only call Mr. Hillman to explain the stabilization agreement but also other OPM officials and A. F. of L. spokesmen who had a hand in it . Charles F. Palmer , Defense Housing Coordinator , commented upon the Currier case and pre-fabricated housing at a press conference . He asserted that pre-fabricated construction was " a streamlined method of building that is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted than the industrial revolution could have been resisted . " " Some experts say that pre-fabrication will lower costs 30 per cent he added . Asked to what extent the OPMA . F. L. stabilization agreement affected denfense housing , he replied : " Ask Mr. Hillman . Our organization was not a party to the agreement . We were not consulted . I have never seen a copy of it . We have no authority to pass upon the acceptance of bids , and therefore have had nothing to do with the Currier case . "
