The Army at last broke secrecy on its most hush-hush subject-its search for new weapons and devices . For the first time in this war , it permitted the National Inventors Council to make public a list of some things the Army needs , invited amateur inventors to put their ingenuity to work on these specific problems. * <P> One revealing request was for a detector to locate " nonmetallic land mines . " This would indicate that the Axis has developed mines , probably made of plastic , that escape detection by magnetic locators . <P> Other gifts the Army would like for Christmas or sooner : a detector to spot unseen enemy soldiers approaching along jungle trails ; a light ( probably using infrared rays ) that would enable soldiers to see objects at night but be invisible to the enemy ; an improved means of signaling the identity of ground troops to friendly planes and vice versa ; a simple , harmless process for darkening metals , especially aluminum , so that they will not reflect light ; a method of waterproofing vehicles so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive , durable metal for soldiers ' dishes ; a means of absorbing or eliminating poisonous carbon monoxide ( apparently a substantial problem to soldiers . working around motorized equipment and plane hangars ) ; new methods of sabotage for use by " friendly inhabitants within enemy occupied areas . " <P> &lt;footnote&gt;* From some 160,000 ideas submitted to the Council since it was formed in 1940 , the armed forces have gleaned more than 40 genuinely helpful inventions , e.g. , milkweed floss , which is used as a substitute for kapok in life preservers ( TIME , April 12 ) , etc. &lt;/footnote&gt;
