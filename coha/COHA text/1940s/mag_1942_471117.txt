MITE Local Draft Board meets twicc a 1 . week , in a long session which may run from four in the afternoon until nearly midnight . There is a meeting going on to-night and the atmosphere of the Selective Service office is charged with suspense ; for the action taken here is deciding how a number of young Americans shall spend the next few years of their lives , and in the back of everybody 's mind is the realization that these decisions may be very literally matters of life and death . This particular office , though it is in a slum district of a great city , happens to be better furnished than most . ( There are some 6,500 draft boards in the United States and they work variously in rented stores , in dingy business offices , in basement apartments , in schoolrooms , some with good equipment and some with very little . ) Here the furniture is good , there is a carpet on the floor , and the records are kept in a battery of modern lockable filing cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is draped a big American flag and on another wall are tacked lively war posters , copies of the President 's registration proclamations , and a bold-face warning to registrants to keep the Local Board informed of any changes in their address , their job , their dependents , or their physical condition . In this outer room there arc a dozen or more men . Leaning against his desk , the Chief Clerk , a harried-looking middle-aged man who not only must keep the intricate machinery of the organization running smoothly but also must be an encyclopedia of the rules and regulations and a forceful diplomat , is answering questions put to him by incoming registrants . " Yes , you 've got to have a permit from this Board to ship to a foreign port . get you the form ? use this pen and fill it out right here if you want . . . . You say your wife is pregnant ? You 'll have to get a doctor 's certificate . No , not for yourself , for your wife ? a certificate that she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neutral alien , so you are classified just as if you were a citizen . But if you object to doing military service you can fill out Form 301 ? only if you sign that form you can never become an American citizen . I 'll give you a copy and you can take it away and look it over . . . . " Along one wall of this outer room are three desks , and at each sits a member of the Advisory Board interviewing a young man and taking notes . These Advisory Board members , serving as collectors and sifters of information for the Local Board , are talking with men who were deferred last year ( put in Class III ) because they had dependents , and finding out just what their present status is , so that the Board may decide whether their deferments should be continued . Along another wall sit five or six registrants awaiting their turn at this inquiry . Go into the inner room and at its end behind a long table , you will see two members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has brought along his elderly father and his plump sister . The Advisory Board member who has gathered information on this dependency case has suggested that the young man may now he Class I material , and the Board members are questioning the elderly father about the family finances . " How much rent do you pay ? . . Have you any money in the bank ? . . . What bank ? . . . What branch of the Corn Exchange Bank ? " ( Even if nobody ever checks up on the answers , specific questions tend to bring honest replies . ) The low-voiced inquiries go on and on . and line by line the picture of the family 's economic status is sketched in . At the other end of the room another member of the Board is reading last year 's questionnaires and picking out an occasional one for " re-opening " ; and in still another corner the Government Appeal Agent , as the appointed watchdog of the whole process , is going over the records of recent Board decisions . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Board members behind the table stretch , and the Appeal Agent saunters over to them . " You fellows made a mistake here , " he says , showing them a questionnaire . " You 've put this fellow in Class I and he 's been convicted of rape . Should be IV F. That 's a heinous crime . " " Not to the Army any more , " replies one of the Board members . " Only murder and crimes involving drugs and perversion . And double offenders and habitual criminal types . " " You 're wrong , " insists the Appeal Agent . " Rape is heinous . " They call for the Chief Clerk , get him to produce the rule-book , find that rape is truly heinous , record their enforced reversal of themselves on the questionnaire and on the outside of the rapist 's folder ? that Domesday Book of his Selective Service history which contains , along with his questionnaire , copies of all correspondence with him and notes on all interviews with him ? and dispose themselves to face the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month in order to sell his interest in his barber shop . They listen to him , argue with him briefly , like his looks , and grant his plea . " That 's two more men lost from our next induction list , " reflects one of them sadly . " And we 're way short of our quota now . Lord , but this thing gets tougher and tougher . " So it does . . just II how tough , it is difficult for outsiders to realize . For recently the Selective Service System , already strained by the magnitude of its task , has speeded up tremendously . During the first thirteen months of its operation , while the country was at least nominally at peace , it produced almost a million men for the Army with singularly little friction considering the fierce division of public opinion over foreign policy . Since Pearl Harbor it has gone into double time ? with the result that before long it will be well into its third million . Up to now the basic democratic good sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scores of thousands of people who administer it , and the real devotion and considerateness of the best of them have won for it a very favorable reputation . Now the problems which it faces multiply and this reputation is put to the test . Let us take a look at these problems . The purpose of the Selective Service System is to choose for service in the Army men who not only are physically , mentally , and morally fit but also may be removed from civilian life with the least possible derangement of the war industries , of essential civilian services , and of family life . The task has been likened to a huge game of jackstraws in which the players try to pick out those straws which can be lifted with the least disturbance of the pile . To accomplish this result democratically and wisely three principles have been brought into play . First , every male in certain age groups must be potentially eligible for service and must register . Second , the System is decentralized widely , and the rules on which decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case may be decided locally by a group of citizens ? unpaid volunteers all ? who will have time to consider individual predicaments one by one in their infinitely unpredictable variety . And third , the order in which these cases will be considered is determined , not by anybody 's whim , but by lot : after each registration the men 's cards are shuffled and then serial-numbered , the order in which serial numbers shall become Order Numbers is ordained by a public drawing from the big goldfish bowl in Washington , and thus each man 's position in the line is protected from manipulation by the double operation of chance . During the first year or so that the System was in operation the Local Boards were mailing out questionnaires , fifty at a time , to their thousands of registrants ? the average Board had nearly 3,000 registrants and many had 4,000 or 5,000 or 6,000 ? beginning with the low Order Numbers and progressing through the list ; then they were classifying the men on the basis of the sworn information in the questionnaires , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borderline cases ; and the men who were put in Class I were submitting to physical examination and ? if they passed both this examination and a further one by the Army ? were going into the service , group by group , as the Army called for them . The Army decided how many men it needed at a given time and these figures were broken up into quotas for the various Boards . The quota for any given Board at any given time was determined at first by the number of registrants it had , and later , roughly , by thenumber of Class I men it had , with due regard to other circumstances ? the nature of the community , the rate at which its men were passing the Army physical examinations , etc. ? the idea being to play upon the quota list as upon an organ to produce from the various Boards their fair contributions to the total . During the spring of 1941 ? when the Army began calling for men in considerable numbers ? the machinery creaked a good deal . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical examiners to do this unaccustomed task rapidly enough . The attitude of the registrants in those days was usually one of resignation to implacable fate but often was bewildered or evasive or sullen . By the summer and fall of 1941 , however , the pace had slackened somewhat , the Boards were better organized and had learned the ropes , and the System had got its second wind . Then came Pearl Harbor ? the big speed-up . The actual onset of war brought a marked change in the attitude of most registrants ? less visible desire to dodge service , more volunteering for induction ? though the men who wanted to get into uniform at once generally enlisted in other ways than via Selective Service . The war also enlarged the number of eligibles : the men between 28 and 36 , who had been temporarily deferred since the preceding summer , were now available . But as the calls for men grew , pretty soon the average Board found that it was getting near enough to the bottom of its reservoir of men originally put in Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it start reclassifying to get more Class I 's ? To be sure , an emergency reservoir of candidates presently became available . In February boys who had reached the age of twenty and had not previously registered were required to do so ; and so were the men between 36 and 44 ? a far less promising group from the military point of view . But it became clear that some sort of reclassification would be necessary anyhow . And in this fact was concealed a hornet 's nest of difficulties . HI The situation which had been reached by midwinter ? this past midwinter ? may be illustrated by looking at the condition of an average Board with 3,000 registrants ( from its first two registrations ? the first big one in October , 1940 , and the little one for the 21-year-olds in July , 1941 ) . This is a purely hypothetical Board which I shall describe , but the figures which I shall give are based as far as possible , in very round numbers , on the national averages as of early 1942 . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the draft induction process , some 180 of its 3,000 men . Sixty more had enlisted otherwise in the Army , Navy , Marines or Coast Guard , making a total of 240 men in the services . ( Of course this total does not include men from the Board 's district who were already in the services at registration time and thus were excused from registering . ) In addition , the Board had some 300 men in one stage or another of the examination process ? actually in Class I A and awaiting induction , or else awaiting physical examination ? and of these 300 it could reasonably guess that about 150 would get into the Army . ( The others would belatedly show convincing reasons for deferment or would flunk their Local Board physical examinations or , having passed these , would be turned down after their further physical examination at the Induction Center . ) The Board had already put 120 men into Class I B after physical examination ( as fit only for limited military service and not then wanted by the Army ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination ( as unfit for service ) . In going through the questionnaires the Board had placed 150 other men in Class IV ? a mixed bag consisting of the obviously physically , mentally , or morally unfit ( cripples , cancer hospital patients , insane hospital patients , criminals , etc. ) , the clergy , non-declarant aliens , conscientious objectors , and " certain officials deferred by law . " ( Incidentally , hardly one man out of the 3,000 was a duly attested conscientious objector . ) Into Class II ? reserved for men necessary to the welfare of the community ( such as policemen and firemen , most of whom had been deferred ) and men needed in war production ? this hypothetical average Board had put only 90 men . Obviously this figure varied in the experience of actual Boards according to the locality : it was 210 per 3,000 registrants in the average Board in Connecticut , where many war factories were located ; it was a little higher than that in North Dakota and Wisconsin , where the need for maintaining the supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 or 500 in a war factory town ; and it was less than 30 in some of the Southern States . Some 120 men out of the Board 's 3,000 were still unclassified or in process of classification . Let us see now : 180 men inducted , 60 enlisted , 300 on the way , 120 in Class I B ( limited service ) , 120 in Class IV F after examination ( unfit ) , 150 in Class IV otherwise , 90 in Class II ( necessary men ) , 120 unclassified : that adds up to only 1,140 men out of a total of 3,000 . What about the other 1,860 ? They were all in Glass Ill ? deferred because of dependents . Although the regulations had been purposely vague on the subject of dependency , leaving the burden of decision very largely on the shoulders of the individual Boards , the great majority of Boards had been deferring all married men ( except perhaps recently married men suspected of loving Class III not less than their brides , and men whose wives had other means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large number of single men whose families apparently needed their financial contributions . But the standards followed had varied according to the nature of the community and the temper of the Board . In a suburban community where single men were few and far between , the married man was more likely to be sent into the Army . In a poor urban community where unemployment had been rife there were more single men deferred : in an Italian community , for instance , where families were large and it was the custom for the children to give up all financial responsibility for their parents as soon as they married , and the Depression had hastened the unemployability of many fathers ( so that Board members got used to reading on questionnaires that the father , at 56 or 58 , was " too old to work " ) , the remaining single sons were likely to be carrying a heavy financial load . Then too there were tough Boards and gentle Boards ? indeed , the chief criticism of the System was that two men whose dependency situations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and few of the critics realized that such discrepancies , bad as they might seem , were vastly preferable to a rigid set of rules which could not allow for the different standards of living in different districts or for the infinite variety of special family situations . But under the circumstances the national draft statistics were less remarkable for their diversity than for their uniformity . I have said that our average Board with 3,000 registrants had put 1,860 of them in Class III . That comes to 62 per cent . The highest percentage of Class III 's ? reckoning by states ? was in Utah , where it came to a little over 70 ; the lowest was in the District of Columbia , where it came to a little less than 52 . Now you must imagine this average Local Board confronted with larger and larger calls for men . The quotas set for it rise sharply . Looking ahead , the members of the Board realize that by the end of 1942 , at the rate the Army is expanding , they may be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have already sent ? and the figure may run to 400 or 500 . Where shall they find these men ? To begin with , they have those 150 men or so whom we found to be on the way to presumable acceptance by the Army . In addition recent changes in the regulations will help a little . The relaxation of the physical standards , beginning in February , is already pushing into the Army some of 120 men who were originally put in Class I B ( fit for limited service only and not accepted previously ) and may in due course push in some or all of the rest . The two leading causes for rejection during 1941 were dental defects ( about 20 per cent of rejections ) and defective eyes ( between 13 and 14 per cent ) ; and in both of these respects the standards are already much less exacting . ( It must be borne in mind that the original physical standards were probably a good deal higher than those of any European country . ) It is a fair guess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I B men to become available during 1942 ? and also , of course , that it will find its percentage of rejections running lower from now on . The reclassification of aliens , ordered in March , may produce perhaps 10 or 20 men for our average Board . The registration of the 20-year-oIds and 21-year-olds last February may in due course produce something like 100 men , assuming that a third of them will qualify for service . The registration of the 36-to-44-year-old group , which took place at the same time , may also produce a considerable number of men ; but let us guess that our average Local Board , after going through the prodigious task of classifying them , will find only some 5 per cent of them available by present standards : that would come to only about 75 men in this average Board . For it is natural to expect that the number of men who have no dependents and are physically in decent shape would be low in this older age group . Adding up these very tentative estimates , we arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 410 to 430 men from these sources during 1942 , as against a need which may be for 360 men and may be considerably higher . That looks hopeful . There are still further hopes , too . If a new crop of 20-year-olds should be registered this summer , that may eventually give the Board another 25 men or so ; and if by new legislation the age-limit should be cut to 18 or 19 , these younger boys might provide still another 150 or 200 . But to count on such measures now is to look too far ahead . Not only that , but to count on completing the classification of the men who registered last February in time to fill this summer 's quotas is also to look too far ahead . The Board needs men now . Furthermore it ought not if possible even to dip into the 36-to44 group until it has exhausted the reasonably available supply of younger men , who will on the average make better soldiers than their seniors . The answer is clear : it must get some if not most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must get them by reclassification , and it must get them at once . It can not get more than a handful of them out of Class IV ( that curious collection of the unfit and the exempt ) . Nor should it try to get them out of Class II ( necessary men , war production workers ) , though this is a conclusion often difficult for Draft Board members to accept . Nothing has been harder for the Selective Service people to swallow than the departure of able-bodied young men into the shelter of Class II via the war industries . Any member of almost any Draft Board will tell you of some Class II case that griped him ? of some young man who was clearly military material and quite obviously never thought of being an aircraft worker till he felt the hot breath of the Draft Board on his neck , and yet got a job in a war factory and had become " essential " before the Board could catch up with him . To draft such men now might be morally just . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Board has wisely asked the fac-MAGAZINE tories in its vicinity to replace their able-bodied young single workers as soon as possible with over-age or at least married men , and then to let the Board have the single ones for military service ; and in due course ? after the vocational questionnaire has been sent out to the younger men , as it will be ? the Boards can bring pressure on at least some of the younger men-with-dependents to take war-industry jobs ( if they are qualified ) . But in the meantime it is undeniably true that the war production men , however low may be one 's regard for the motives of some of them , are most useful to the country where they are . Not only that , but the expansion of the war industries this year must be so great , and the folly of letting the Selective Service System interfere with it is so manifest , that our hypothetical board may well permit its proportion of Class II men actually to increase . Inescapable conclusion : the situation must be met by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with dependents ) ; and the sooner this is done , the better . Boards which heretofore have been lenient in dealing with dependency cases may be able to get 300 or 400 men from this source before digging deeply into the new groups of registrants ; Boards which have been more severe will be well advised to restrain themselves but should be able to get at least 100 or 200 . IV Here . however , our difficulties are just beginning . The first one is the volume of work under which the Boards and their clerical staffs now stagger . The registration of the 20-21 group and the 36-44 group , last February , added some 1,500 new men to the 3,000 which our average Board had on its list . To each of these 1,500 men the Board had to send both a regular military questionnaire and a big cardboard vocational questionnaire . The military questionnaires , when they come back to the Board , must be studied just as carefully as the original 3,000 and a decision must be reached on each . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more questionnaires , more decisions . Two or three alert Draft Board men can go through from fifty to a hundred questionnaires an hour ? but at the end of that time , if they are conscientious , they will have set aside five or ten borderline cases on which they are unwilling to decide until they have talked with the registrant himself and perhaps with members of his family too . At this rate a careful Board proceeds very slowly through a list of 1,500 men . And this labor is all superimposed upon the complex task of classifying and reclassifying the original 3,000 men ! Nor are these the only tasks loaded upon the Boards . Consider , for example , the holding of registrations . In the Local Board of which I used to be a member , in New York , the April registration of men between 44 and 65 lasted three days and involved the accurate listing of some 3,000 older men , many of whom did not know English . One member of the Board undertook to organize this registration . He secured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building with the Draft Board office . He enlisted several score volunteer registrars and assistants and gave two carefully prepared lectures to them beforehand , rehearsing them in how to meet every conceivable problem . When the registration began , his assistants were ready to check the address of every incoming man , to steer the long line on its way to the cafeteria tables where the registrars sat facing the registrants , to direct the man at the head of the line ( head-waiter fashion ) to the first seat left vacant , and to provide interpreters in several languages for those who needed them . It was a fine shipshape job of organization ? but you may be sure that during those three days that member of the Board had no time to read questionnaires . He had no time even to read the incoming bulletins of instructions from Headquarters , which is something of a job in itself ? for these bulletins sometimes tend to be long , complex , couched in legal language rather than in clear English , and confusing if not contradictory . ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletin on the proper policy with regard to illiterates , and coming at last to the dreadful conclusion that the author of the bulletin in defining an illiterate had quite forgotten that there might be such a phenomenon as a foreigner quite literate in his own language who could n't speak or understand English . ) The average Board would greatly appreciate clear , simple , brief guides to policy . And many Board members add vehemently that they wish Selective Service officials , in their speeches and public statements , would refrain from saying things that do n't correspond with their instructions to the Boards and only confuse the registrants . For the clerical staff , too , the burden of work becomes heavier week by week . The number of questionnaires , notices , and " call-ins " to be sent out ; the number of forms to be filled out in duplicate or triplicate or quadruplicate ; the number of reports , statistical and otherwise , which must be made to State Headquarters ; the number of entries which must be made in this record or that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless task of merely recording changes of address , have long since become a clerical nightmare . How Draft Boards in rural districts cope with this mass of clerical detail I do not know ; but from my personal observation in New York and the wrathful evidence I have collected elsewhere , it is clear that in the cities ? and especially in districts where many registrants are ignorant or careless and do not follow instructions carefully -- there must be immediate provision for the expansion of the clerical staffs . One additional clerk has recently been provided to look after the vocational questionnaires ? those huge cardboard documents which are intended to help the U. S. Employment Service in ferreting out potential war-industry workers who arc now otherwise employed ? but that is not nearly enough . Moreover it is obvious that in at least some of the urban districts the pay of the Chief Clerk , which has been limited to $150 a month , and of the Assistant Clerk , which has been limited to $100 a month , should immediately be increased in view of the important responsibilities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board clerks are so intricate and require so much precise knowledge of the regulations that volunteer aids are of very little use . " If my $100-a-month assistant clerk leaves me for a job that 'll pay her what she 's entitled to , I 'll be ready to jump in the river , " said a Draft Board chairman to me . The Selective Service System may break down from sheer overload of necessary detail if its clerical staffs are not strengthened and decently paid . Now imagine these hard-beset Board members and clerks trying simultaneously to classify the 36-to-44 men and to reclassify the men-with-dependents . Will they be able to do these two jobs ? and particularly the reclassification , which it will be easier to slight ? thoroughly and wisely ? That introduces a human problem . The standard of personnel in the Local Boards is prevailingly high , but the temperaments are as various as human nature . There is the impatiently patriotic man whose one idea is that he is recruiting an army and who is inclined to breeze through the list of deferred men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints ( if they make any ) as mere cowardly temporizing . There is the estimable but ill-informed man who forgets that the merchant marine is a vital service these days , or that farm labor is really needed , or that 51 .000 a year will not keep a family of three in a big city ; and the careless man who does not notice that a registrant has said on his questionnairethat he is married ; and the soft-hearted man who is so melted by every dependency case that if he were left to his own devices the work of reclassification would come almost to a standstill . With two or more men taking plenty of time on each case , the vagaries of judgment which these temperaments cause are mostly canceled out ; but the faster the pace of the work , the greater the likelihood of arbitrary or unfair decisions . Add to this the fact that the questionnaires which are being reassessed are mostly a year or more out of date and the chances of error multiply . The job of bringing the information up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office which I described at the beginning of this article ? and of coming to sober and careful decisions is all too likely to be skimped . As this article goes to press , Congress is putting through legislation to raise the soldier 's pay to $42 or more a month , and is also considering legislation to provide that $20 of this amount , plus a separation allowance of $20 additional ? making $40 in all ? shall be sent home to his family if he has dependents . ( The amount may be somewhat bigger than this . ) There has also been agitation for a further flexible allowance for dependents , to be determined in each case in accordance with need and to be administered through the Federal Security Agency . ( This latter plan would have the effect , first , of making almost every man in Class III economically eligible for the Army , and second , of putting a large part of the Army on a sort of WPA basis under Security Agency auspices ? which might make the payments as politically difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan will be put into effect it is impossible to say at this writing . But this much can be said with certainty . If an allotment of $40 or $50 a month is decided upon , it will make far easier the recruiting of some men from Class III without undue hardship ; but also it will vastly increase the temptation to the overloaded Draft Boards to reclassify men heedlessly on a wholesale basis on the ground that " dependents are taken care of anyhow . " Now in some farm areas $40 a month is quite a sum , but in the cities it is only a fraction of what one dependent needs to live on ; and to a family which has been living on , say , a $5,000 scale ? with all the commitments in rent , etc. , which that involves ? it is almost negligible . The passage of such a measure will not make it any easier for the Local Boards to exercise that wise discretion on which the good reputation of the draft has principally rested . V The worst defect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time this article appears . Beginning early this spring , the Draft Board physicians conducted only " screening " physical examinations which amounted to little more than having the men walk across the room before the doctor to assure him that they had their full quota of arms , legs , and fingers ? and the real examination was conducted by the Army at the Induction Center , whereupon some two-thirds of the men were accepted and marched right off to camp , and the other third of them were rejected and sent home ; so that a man who had given up his job and his room , had said good-by to his family and friends , and perhaps had sold his belongings with the idea that he was going into the Army might find himself humiliatingly thrown back into civilian life without warning . This outrageous system was adopted in place of the much more sensible plan ( used previously in most States ) of having the Army examination held some days before induction , so that men knew beforehand whether to burn their bridges or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the layman an absurd reason : that once a man had passed his pre-induction examination and knew he was headed for military service , there was nothing to keep him from decidingthat he 'd rather be in the Navy or the Marine Corps , and despite stern admonitions from Washington there was nothing to keep Navy or Marine Corps recruiting officers from accepting him . So the Army decided to induct him as soon as it made sure he was qualified . As I write , this generally condemned system is to be modified by offering the newly inducted men furloughs long enough to permit them to go home and wind up their affairs . The new plan , scheduled to go into full effect in June , is a vast improvement . A possible future threat to the System lies in the possibility of group deferments ? rules saying that men doing this sort of work or that must be deferred . Nothing could do more to destroy the strongest asset of the draft . Some bulletins from Headquarters have pointed out at length that it is possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coal miner , to be essential and therefore deferrable . Quite true ? but to make such deferments mandatory would turn Selective Service into a football for pressure groups . Likewise Senator Taft 's proposal for rigid rules of classification as to marriage and dependents would kill that very flexibility which is so valuable . Otherwise I see no glaring fault in the System which can not be overcome by the distribution of some money to strengthen the clerical staffs , by the simplification and clarification of bulletins of instruction from Headquarters , and by indefatigable labor on the part of the Local Boards . The Selective Service System was soundly conceived . Much criticized at first because it would not provide us either with a small and highly trained mechanized army or with a sound basis for permanent conscription , it proved on the declaration of war to be just what the doctor would have ordered : a fair and orderly method of expanding the Army indefinitely . Its decentralization of decision and its volunteer character have been great assets : the caliber of the Board members is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that Selective Service answers to the description of most American war enterprises which reach all the way out into the communities ? the individual units do a better job on the average than the co-ordinating authorities , because they are manned by people , no less able , who have the advantage of being face-to-face with their problem instead of having to guess at it from a far-away desk . Some enormously hard work is done at the Local Board offices . Few people outside the System have any conception of the amount of unpaid , thankless , and often distasteful labor which has been put in by the Board members , Advisory Board members , Appeal Agents , Appeal Board members , and examining physicians . I can think of one New York Board , for example , in which a retired business man slaves every day from nine till seven or so , and another one spends several hours every afternoon , with no compensation beyond his satisfaction over the job done . The effectiveness and democratic reputation of the System arc vastly enhanced by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been very few pipelines to officer 's status in the Army for young men of wealth and social position . The Army , as it expands , is officering itself from the ranks ; during 1942 , for instance , it expects to send 95,000 privates and non-commissioned officers to Officers ' Candidate Schools , and to graduate 75,000 of them . Incidentally , of all the criticisms of Selective Service that I have heard , one which I should have expected to hear often I have heard only once ? the criticism that the rich get deferred ? and in that one case the man who uttered it had suffered no injustice at all : he simply did not understand how the Order Numbering system worked and angrily guessed that the rich boys got the high numbers . ( Nor shall I soon forget the almost eager way in which the members of the Board with whom that young man was registered put sons of the well-to-do in Class I. ) The result of these democratic arrangements has been not only to make our Army personnel perhaps the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to change remarkably the public attitude toward the private soldier . In towns which have been historically Army towns , the private may still be unwelcome in the best restaurants and bars ; but in other areas he seems to be accepted unquestioningly everywhere . The other evening I noted the presence of five or six privates in an especially fashionable grill in New York and asked an old habitue of the place whether their like would have been found there in 1917 . " No , " said he . " I do n't know if they would even have been admitted . At any rate they 'd have felt uncomfortable in the same room with those colonels and lieutenant commanders . " A small matter , that , but big in its underlying significance . And it is largely the product of the working of the Selective Service System .
