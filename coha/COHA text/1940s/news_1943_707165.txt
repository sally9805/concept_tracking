txt A " paper-skinned " Coast Guard cutter , commanded by a skipper from New York City , recently shepherding a : large and important convoy across the North Atlantic , outmanoeuvred , out-shot and sank a German submarine , then plucked from the water forty Nazi seamen who were screaming ** and " Virasserbombs ! " the Navy Department disclosed today . The cutter was the 2,000-ton , 327 foot Spencer , one of the Ham , ilton class of ships that have distinguished themselves in previous anti-submarine actions . Her skipper is Commander Harold S. Berdine . The Navy indicated that it considered the action , which took place only a few weeks ago , one of the epic anti-submarine encounters of the war . The Spencer 's fight was graphically recorded for naval annals , for on deck with three cameras ready just as the action broke was Chief Boatswain 's Mate Jack January , a former St. Louis newspaper photographer . January started " shooting " as soon as the guns went into action , and the result was a series of battle shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the battle was over an untold number of Nazis . whose heads dotted the water like dark corks bobbing in a tub , had perished , but forty thoroughly frightened survivors of the furious battle // were captured and now are in American hands . The Spencer suffered slight damage and some of her men were wounded , but the only man killed , the Navy said . was Coast Guardsman Julius T. Petrella. 21 , of 1229 Seventy-seventh Street . Brooklyn.1 Petrella received a hero 's burial at sea , with Commander Berdine reading the funeral service , while Captain Paul R. Heineman of Philadelphia , escort unit commander , whose flagship was the Spencer , stood at attention with the rest of the crew . The men aboard the Spencer were aching for a fight as they led ' their convoy through North Atlantic waters . They f had sworn not to shave until their ship . a one stacker that made up in guns what she lacked in armor plate , had a " positive " submarine sinking to her credit . The U-boat . as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly in the path of the convoy . Its commander apparently was attempting to sneak under the escort screen , periscope down . If he had , made it he would have had easy pickings with a choice of many heavily laden targets . But Soundman Harold V. Anderson of Kewanee , Ill. , detected the U-boat 's presence and gave the warning . The bewhiskered crew ran to battle stations and soon the " ash-cans " were kicking up a pattern of boiling g  --  ysers around the spot where the submarine lurked . Submarine Tries to Escape The submarine tried to escape by running under the convoy , apparently in hope that the noise of the cargo ships ' screws would interfere with the cutter 's sound gear . But the Spencer held to the trail like a bloodhound and laid a second , then a third pattern of death charges on the U-boat . bn deck Jack January had been " fanning the breeze " with Chief Boatswain 's Mate Charlie Lockett , a Philadelphian . January was saying something about being " from IVEssouri , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing , when suddenly Lockett grabbed the photographer 's arm and gulped : " Jack , Jack : Is n't that a submarine coming up out there ? " Sure enough , some distance off port quarter , " a long . dark object " was " squeezing itself out of the water . " January heard Commander Berdine say to a gunner 's mate on the wing of the bridge , " Well , son . here 's what you 've been waiting for . Give ' em hell ! " The Coast Guard cutter Duane , 1 ender Captain Harold G. Bradbury , which had been screening the , Spencer during the depth-charge attacks , bore in to help . Gun crews on both ships " opened a withering , effective fire . " The skipper of the Spencer rang for full speed ahead , and despite the " glass hull " of the cutter , prepared to ram . From the Spencer 's deck they could see members of the U-boat crew rush to gun stations on deck . The Spencer 's lifeboats were riddled  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were damaged . The Nazi gunners tried to reach their heavy deck gun forward , but accurate fire from the two cutters beat them back . Round after round took effect , and the U-boat 's deck was a mass of wreckage when the Spencer prepared to ram . Suddenly fire from the submarine ceased and its crewmen began scurrying up through the conning tower and jumping into the sea . When Commander Berdine saw this , he countermanded his order t ( ram . The U-boat Goes Down Just before the U-boat went down , a Nazi seaman was seen clinging to a stanchion near a deck gun . Another shot from the Spencer landed , and the seaman disappeared . Soon after , the submarine sank , its dark bow , cutting the water like a shark fin , disappearing last . The Spencer sent out boats to pick up survivors . Forty were hauled aboard . Some were hysterical . and all seemed completely unnerved . The depth charges , particularly , had taken the fight out of them . Some of them were throwing up their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " January recalled that the Spencer 's crew , in the heat of battle , was " yelling like a college cheering section . " " I closed my eyes once and thought I was back at St. Louis , covering a Cardinal-Dodgers baseball game , " he said . He got his biggest kick when the Spencer got near the huge submarine and he could hear " the Huns " shouting " Halp ! Halp ! " as they " threw up their hands and began jumping overboard . " All but four of the rescued Germans spoke English , January said . They were asked what they would like to eat and answered : " Just bread and jelly . " But one man took a big helping of corned beef and cabbage and soon all were wolfing the food , he related . When the Spencer had " cleaned up the job , " she steamed through the columns of ships to assume her ' station at the head of the convoy . Each ship hoisted a signal of congratulation , and seamen lined the rails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spencer just grinned as they got out their razors and began working lather into stubbled chins . SURVIVOR TELLS OF BATTLE Radio Man on Cutter Saw Buddy Killed in Fight With U-Boat Arnold Diamond , 22 years old , of Los Angeles , Calif. &; a Coast Guardsman , who saw his buddy , Julius Petrella of Brooklyn . die in battle at sea . was interviewed yesterday at the United States Marine Hospital at Stapleton , S. I. , where he is recovering from shock . He told how the Coast Guard cutter Spencer blasted a German submarine out of the sea in a halfhour chase through an Allied convoy . Diamond , who has been in the Coast Guard for three years , is a radio operator , second class , while Petrella was a radio operator , third class , on the ship . " It was about 9:30 A. M. when we made contact , " he said , " and I answered the general quarters signal by reporting to my battle station on the flying bridge . We just poured shells into the sub and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped shots into her the submarine 's crew climbed out of the conning tower and jumped into the water . " After the sub went down we picked up the Germans , forty of them , and most of them were lined up on deck . One of them who spoke English smiled and said he hoped they would be taken to America and not to England . When told they more likely would wind up in England his face fell in sorrow . " Diamond said he was more than surprised at the youth of the Germans , who seemed to average about twenty years . Although Diamond helped with the rescue work , his thoughts were of his buddy , who , he said , died with a smile on his lips . The two were standing on the cutter 's bridge when a shot from the submarine struck Petrella in the stomach . " I could n't believe he was hit , " Diamond said . " Then I shouted for a stretcher . I looked at him and he was lying there with his eyes open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to man the big guns , but we knocked them off before they could get to them . When the sub started to sink the men on the cutter sent up a rousing cheer . The Coast Guard cutter Duane assisted materially in the sinking of the submarine . " Commander Harold S. Berdine , in charge of the Spencer , formerly lived at 630 Victory Boulevard , Silver Lake , S. I. On March 1 he and his wife moved to Manhattan .
