Ghastly visions of plants that eat flesh have troubled the dreams of many imaginative men . In William Randolph Hearst 's American Weekly a romancer named Dr. Carle Liche once described what he saw one frightful tree do to a native girl in Madagascar . " . . . Then while her awful screams . . . rose wildly . . . the great leaves slowly rose and stiffly . . . closed about the dead and hampered victim with the silent force of a hydraulic press . . . . The retracted leaves of the great tree kept their upright position during ten days , then when I came one morning they were prone again . . . and nothing was left but a white skull at the foot of the tree . . . .

There are about 450 species . Their methods of capturing their prey ( ostensibly nothing larger than insects ) are in some measure common to all . But Professor Lloyd breaks down their " trapping mechanisms " into six categories - pitfalls , lobster pots , snares , flypaper or birdlime traps , steel traps and mousetraps . The plants lure their victims by odors , the secretion of nectar and mucilage , the display of bright colors . With few exceptions , the plants have means of digesting their prey. * Enzymes and acids are excreted , and when these are accumulated together with the prey , something like an animal stomach results . <P> Among the most elaborate trapping mechanisms is that of the Dionaea ( Venus's-flytrap ) . Indigenous to North and South Carolina , the Dionaea is a rosette of leaves , three to six inches across , rising from a rootstock more or less horizontally .

The glands with which the surface of the leaf lobes are covered then secrete a digestive fluid and in a few days the insect body disintegrates and the products are absorbed . In the course of ten days the lobes open again , and are ready to catch other prey . This may be repeated two or three times before the leaf reaches its complete maturity , when it dies .
