1-13 EXT . OPEN COUNTRY - DAY FADE IN The sky is pure blue , exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus clouds , floating lazily . A single bird sails past . From the sky the CAMERA MOVES TO earth . Here , too , all is tranquil . The trees , bright green in the sunlight , move only to the slight but constant breeze . Now the CAMERA MOVES DOWN , revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside the road . The wagon is at an awkward angle , but upright . It is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it as they tried to reach some forage . Its seat is empty . In the bed of the wagon several sacks lie , bearing the legend : FROM : ARGUS MINE - ROCK PASS TO : U. S. ASSAY OFFICE SAN FRANCISCO The sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife . The ropes that bound them are cleanly severed . The disorder in the wagon indicates haste .

Now the CAMERA MOVES AWAY and ALONG tracks made by the wagon when it left the road . ON THE ROAD two horses stand . These are saddled , but riderless . The rifle holstors are empty . CAMERA MOVES TO the ground . There on the road lies the rifle . The dust is slightly blowing across it , moved by the persistent summery little breeze . From the rifle , the CAMERA MOVES ON A LITTLE and STOPS ABRUPTLY ON the sprawled dead figure of a soldier , then another , face down in the road . CLOSE SHOT of the dead soldiers , as the CAMERA HOLDS ON them . Near the hand of one a revolver lies , the fine dust coating it .

To one side there is a big stove and the gambling tables . Beyond can be seen pool tables in an alcove . To another side , a man grinds away at a piano . A stairway near the end of the bar leads to an upper floor . The place is crowded and noisy with people . Haven saunters towards the dice table , pauses , watches ; he is looking the crowd over carefully  --  missing no detail of the place or the people in it . When his turn comes , he picks up the dice , bets all over the place  --  on the line , on the odds , on the seven , then on the come , the hard way , etc .

Prince touches the stickman 's arm ; the man stands aside and Prince takes his place with the stick . Prince tosses the dice back to Haven . Haven 's eyes are fixed on him .

All the others have turned to see it ; even the barman is busy watching . But Haven 's eyes are resting on the figure of a woman now at the piano , singing . Softly , as if to herself and for her own enjoyment . He is near the end of the bar and near the piano , and since no one else listens to her at this moment , she sings , half smiling , directly for him , and then , self-consciously , she stops and turns to sit at a table , as Haven watches her .

But you feel she wishes it might . . . 36 ANGLE on the fight . &nbsp; MICKStand still and fight . As Mick closes again , Haven stops quickly to one side , clipping him behind the ear as he goes by . But this time Mick keeps after Haven and finally connects . It is more of a push than a clean hit , but even so the force of it drives Haven off balance and he sprawls on his back . As Mick , sensing victory , charges , Haven knows he ca n't get to his feet in time , so he turns his body and springs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face ; before he can recover , Haven dives on him , hands flat on his own chest and palms turned out . His body crashes heavily , angling across Mick 's head , and Haven 's savagely  --  25  --  pushing hands mash the other man 's face into the hard ground . Then he rolls clear and comes to his feet , breathing easily , waiting . Mick gets up , shaking his head to clear it , mad and hurt . As he closes ponderously in on Haven , his booted foot suddenly shoots out . Haven twists his knee cap away but takes the blow on the inside of his thigh , numbing the leg so that he almost goes down . And now Mick gets to him . His great arms close around Haven 's waist , his hands locked in the small of Haven 's back . Haven braces himself against the crushing squeeze , tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine , but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute power of the other man . The sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength bends him over farther and farther . He must do something , and soon , or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave . Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off the ground . Mick , suddenly finding Haven 's full weight pulling him forward , crashes down on top of him . With all the strength left in him , Haven brings his knee to the pit of Mick 's stomach ; as Mick 's hold breaks , Haven rolls clear . Now they are both hurt . Haven 's ribs and chest are so bruised that it is agony to take a breath . He knows it has to end quickly or he is done for , and he goes all out . As Mick tries to close with him again , he stands his ground and throws pile-driver punches to Mick 's midsection ; as Mick finally lowers his arms to cover his body , Haven shifts his attack to the face . This is not Mick 's style of fighting , but as he lashes back clumsily and angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Toe to toe , they slug it out , the belt now unwound and dangling from Mick 's fist , both men groggy but both refusing to go down . Finally Mick is helpless to protect himself , but Haven has n't got power left to knock him off those sturdy legs . Gathering himself , Haven hurls his body shoulder first at Mick 's chest but he miscalculates , glances off and falls flat on his face . As he rolls over , dogged and slow with exhaustion , he sees that his weight has staggered Mick ; the big man has taken a step back , and now he starts to walk forward . Dazed and blind with pain , he passes Haven , staggers forward until the tie-rail stops him . There he stands , his hands on the rail , moving his head from side to side like a wounded animal . The crowd is silent now , waiting . Haven gets to his feet , drunk with weariness . He puts a hand on Mick 's shoulder , but has n't the strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the tie-rail , and almost in slow motion pulls Mick around and clips him one last time with his remaining strength . Mick goes down .  --  26  --  &nbsp; MICK ( getting up very slow ) You ca n't do this . Before he is up he goes down again , unable to make it . &nbsp; MICK ( cont 'd ) ( in the dirt ) Nobody can do this . . . to me . The crowd is transfixed . They ca n't even cheer . The two bouncers lean over the fallen Mick . &nbsp; BOUNCERSomebody just did . They pick up Mick as Haven stupidly watches . Then as Haven turns and goes away , swaying and weak , the roar rises . He pushes aside people who try to assist him . They move aside and watch him leave . The crowd goes back in the saloon behind the vanquished Mick . . . . 37 ANGLE on Charlie , Bristow and Prince .

Charlie is still leaning against the desk , but there is a strange look on her face . A thin smile for Haven . Now she sags a little and Haven realizes she has been hit .
