txt The defense tax bill , proposing an unprecedented rise of $3,529,200,000 in the nation 's levies , was formally reported today by the Ways and Means Committee , which - said it was convinced that the country would pay the increased levies cheerfully , because of the imperative need of making American shores invulnerable to attack . The measure , comprising ninetyfive pages of printed matter , proposed levies which would increase the Federal revenue from these sources : from corporations , normal and excess profits , $1,322,900 , - 000 ; individuals $1,152,000,000 , and miscellaneous excise taxes , $1,054 , - 300,000 . In reporting the measure the committee said : " The bill is unprecedented in the amount of revenue it is designed to provide . It lays a ? substantially increased burden upon the American people . " But there is convincing evidence that this burden will be borne cheerfully in the light of the overwhelming importance of national defense to the continued freedom and security of the United States . " It ' is believed that the risk to life and property from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive by comparison . " Effort for Fairness Cited The committee declared it had done its utmost to make the tax burden as equitable as possible " Due consideration was given , " the committee said , " to the economic and social effects of the proposed levies . There was continually in mind the need for keeping to a minimum , consistent with our defense efforts , any disruption of our economy , and at the same time supplying a needed restraint upon inflationary tendencies . " To effect this aim , the commit tee increased the rates on most of the existing excise taxes ( excluding tobacco and gasoline ) , raised the corporation excess profits levy 10 percentage points in each bracket to bring the rates to from 30 to 35 per cent in the lowest bracket and to 60 per cent in the highest bracket ; it also proposed a surtax corporation rate of 5 per cent on the first $25,000 of profits , and 6 per cent above that amount ; it proposed also a surtax on individual incomes which starts at 5 per cent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises progressively to 75 per cent on incomes of $3,500,000 or over . Administration Advice unheeded In writing the bill , which required three months from the day that hearings were started , the committee rebuffed the Administration on various proposals . It decided not to heed the advice , reportedly made by President Roosevelt , to delete the " average earnings basis " for computing corporation excess profits and left in the law the two alternative methods of figuring this- tax on the basis of average earnings or invested capital The committee also refused to go all the way on levying excessive rates on such things as automobiles , refrigerators and such other " durable consumer goods " as Leon Henderson , Administrator of Price Control , had proposed . Mr. Henderson 's idea was that the measure in part should place such a heavy tax on goods which compete with the defense program ? such as automobiles , on which he proposed a levy of 20 per cent ? as to make it a non-inflationary measure . In pointing out that there is no such thing as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informally stated that though it would impose onerous burdens upon those who are to be taxed , it was as nearly equitable as possible . But in the voluminous report that accompanied the bill , the majority of the committee gave considerable space to a defense of one of the most controversial items in the measure  --  that providing for mandatory joint returns for husbands and wives . The committee , which was divided 15 to 10 for retaining this item , contended in the report that it was justified on the ground that for the country as a whole , it was equitable . It mentioned the nine " community property States , " and said that an extension of the act to cover married couples would inure to the benefit of married couples in non-community property States . Debate This Week Is Planned The inclusion of the joint return provision , coupled with various other items , was considered to have made the tax measure an extremely controversial one for the House , which is to take up the bill Monday under present plans , and debate it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , was the report , issued last night . of the Republican members of the committee , who , while admitting the need of new taxes . pointedly inquired of the Administration why it had not decreased its non-defense expenditures . The Ways and Means Committee denied the Republicans the opportunity to amend the bill to require a $1,000,000,000 cut in non-defense items . The " rule " under which the bill is expected to be considered by the House , will preclude the offering of amendments from the floor . Therefore , the rank and file of the House membership must vote down this if they are to be free to offer individual amendments . Thus , there is ground for a prediction that the fight on the bill will be made primarily on the rule , and if this is voted down , there may be a tax measure sent to the Senate which will vary in considerable degree from . the one reported today by the committee .                    @
