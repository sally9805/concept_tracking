Last week Bulgaria longed to get out of the war with the longing of a dying man for life . In Sofia before an extraordinary session of Parliament Premier Ivan Bagrianoff spoke extraordinary words . What he said might be timely demagoguery , but it implied that Bulgarians wanted to hear it , and it foreshadowed the . social changes which may accompany the break of satellite states with the Nazis . <P> Said Bagrianoff : " The majority of the Bulgarian people never wanted to interfere in a large-scale conflict between great powers . The Government declares it fully recognizes this . It is determined to remove all obstacles that stand in the way of the Bulgarian people 's love for peace . <P> " Our barefoot and naked peasant would like to know why he is barefoot and naked . . . why people have forgotten the taste of meat . " Bulgaria , he said , was in " a state of economic chaos . <P> " This war will certainly end with a large-scale social organization of mankind , both horizontally and vertically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of government is concerned . . . will lead to the strengthening of the democratic concept ... to more political freedom for the individual . It will end with achievements in the economic field that will reduce the exploitation of man by man . . . . " <P> Clearly Premier Bagrianoff was running , not walking , toward the nearest exit-Russia.
