This week . C. I. O. 's President Philip Murray had ready at last a big labor effort : a " Survey of the Steel Industry . " To the question whether steel 's present capacity is adequate to defense needs , Mr. Murray humbly answered : " We do not know . " But he did come out with a number of flat assertions certain to cause discussion . Chief of them : that the industry 's output is 5,920,195 net tons short of real capacity . Other Murray claims : <P> Bessemer furnaces ( now unused ) could produce 1,965,800 net tons ; extended use of the Bessemer flame-control process could produce another 1,000,000 net tons ; idle open-hearth and finishing facilities could produce 2,454,395 net tons ; idle facilities for making concrete reinforcement bars ( mostly in small , independent plants ) could be used , releasing 500,000 tons of open-hearth steel capacity . <P> Said Murray : " Much of this additional steel tonnage , however , will not be produced as long as the steel industry continues its present wasteful and inefficient operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of total steel production . " Murray had a plan , claimed that it was eminently practical . His plan : an Industry Council made up of an equal number of representatives from management and S. W. O. C. , chairmanned by a Government man . Among the Council 's duties : <P> 1 ) Boss the whole industry as though it were one huge plant . <P> 2 ) Put present idle capacity into operation . <P> 3 ) Distribute orders so that a few large companies ( such as Bethlehem , where S. W. O. C. has tried unsuccessfully so far to get a contract ) are not permitted to pile up backlogs while smaller mills lie idle . <P> 4 ) Reallocate contracts to fit special capabilities of mills . <P> 5 ) Determine whether the industry needs to be expanded . <P> Whatever flaws they may pick in the plan , however much they may dislike labor 's brashness in offering to help them run their business , steelmen , with the calculating eye of the Administration upon them , are not likely to brush the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his survey . ) In one respect steelmen can feel pleased : it is a notable change for the better that labor should show eagerness not only to make demands for itself but to face the industry 's problems .
