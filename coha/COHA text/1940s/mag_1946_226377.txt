Like offhand remarks , artists ' sketches sometimes have a persisting value of their own . Last week both Chicago 's Art Institute and Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum featured big shows of drawings . Together they provided two backstage glimpses at Europe 's art history . <P> Manhattan 's Metropolitan featured 70 drawings from the 15th to the 19th Century . Standouts were six casual masterpieces by the 15th-Century Florentines , who drew mostly in sepia and silverpoint ( indelible ) . Trained to make each stroke right the first time , men like Michelangelo , Filippino Lippi and Verrochio looked long and hard before translating their models ' flesh into thin lines . Their looser chalk studies , like Michelangelo 's Libyan Sibyl , showed the same supreme accuracy . <P> Rembrandt ( 1606-69 ) , less interested in objective accuracy and less patient , enclosed the general looks of things with parenthetical stabs of his pen , gave them loose cloaks of broadly brushed shadow . His eight sketches at the Metropolitan ( a woman hanging from a gibbet , a burgher sitting on a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he felt about it . <P> The Met was proudest of seven newly acquired studies by the 19th-Century Frenchman Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres , who believed that drawing is seven-eighths of art . His penciled portraits had all the icy perfection , but not the controlled fire of the Renaissance greats . Said Classicist Ingres : " Let us not admire Rembrandt and the others through thick and thin ; let us not compare them . . . to the divine Raphael and the Italian School ; that would be blaspheming . " <P> Chicago 's show , " Drawings Old and New , " would have been even more blasphemous to the French perfectionist . On exhibition were a Van Gogh landscape made of a briar patch of angry , tangled pen strokes ; a Picasso drawing of two nudes which looked like sacks of coal ( and another which might have been a doodle by Raphael ) ; Group of Draped Standing Figures ( headless ) by British Sculptor Henry Moore ; a wildly sketched , toad-faced " Conqueror " hoisting a stein of beer , by Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to admit the simplicity and tenderness of Sculptor Brancusi 's three huddled Infants .
