I HAD the good fortune in Cairo to obtain a copy of a confidential study of British policy in the Middle East . The document in my possession is a collection of three papers " by a study group of the Cairo group of Chatham House . " Chatham House , at 10 St. James 's Square , Londori , is the headquarters of the Royal Institute of International Affairs . The institute is the equivalent , in a sense , of our American Foreign Policy Association , but is far more authoritative . Its personnel and pay roll during the war interlocked closely with the Foreign Office , the Colonial Office , and the Ministry of Economic Warfare . The Royal Institute reflects the informed , conservative , imperial point of view , and it speaks for the experienced and thoughtful elements among the permanent bureaucracy of the Foreign and Colonial offices . The Cairo group of Chatham House , which prepared this study , includes many of Britain 'S leading colonial and diplomatic officials in the Middle East , and I am told that the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the veteran Oriental counselor of the British embassy in Egypt . The study made by the Cairo group is called " The Interests of the Commonwealth in the Middle East , " the commonwealth , in this case , being a euphemism for the empire . It is dated February of last year , and the typescript bears the name of the institute as publisher . The American members of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine could do worse than obtain copies of this document for their own use . Its 25,000 words provide a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the Middle East and the best available candid exposition of what the men in actual charge of Britain 's relations there are thinking . What these men  --  diplomats , intelligence officers , soldiers , experts , and colonial officials  --  are thinking does not necessarily determine what the new Labor government will do , but one can hardly deny the immense influencethey have on top-level decisions and hesitations in London . Nor does it take more than a glance around the world , from Greece to Java , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign , imperial , and colonial policy which these permanent officials must find very gratifying . The Cairo study , to my mind , reveals the real undercurrents of British policy in the Middle East far better than the elaborate balancings of Mr. Bevin 's statement on Palestine or the appalling incomprehension and vulgarity with which , he admonished the survivors of Belsen not to try to get to the head of the queue . The Middle East is described , quite correctly , in this Chatham House study as " a social and economic slum " in which " the greater part of the cultivable land is owned by large landowners . " " Almost everywhere " in this area " the peasants are heavily in debt to moneylenders . " The only country districts " with a free , enlightened , and comparatively prosperous peasantry are to befound in Lebanon and among ' P the Jewish settlements in Palestine . " Everywhere else " the peasants are still ignorant , diseased , and unchanging . " I would say , from my own observations , that this is unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete fairness would have involved an unwelcome admission of the benefits Jewish immigration has brought to the Arab , Britain 's long-standing interests in this ancient slum are described as having " always been largely negative " ? which may help to explain why it remains a slum . Britain 's major concern was seeing that the Middle East did not fall into hands " strong enough to employ its strategic advantages as a means of crippling Britain 's world position . " This major concern was long served quite simply by " a policy of supporting the weak Ottoman Empire , of ' bolstering up the Turk . ' " The " negative interest " dictated the keeping of a weak , corrupt , and inefficient power in charge of the slum . British imperialists did December 29 , 1945 not then and do not now want to see a Middle East strong and progressive enough to stand on its own feet athwart the route to India . The Chatham House document is strongly anti-Zionist . In discussing Britain 's experience in the Middle East during the war , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Egypt , and elsewhere and says not one word about the great contribution made to the British war effort by Palestinian Jewish soldiers , the skilled Jewish workers of the naval base at Haifa , and the Jewish underground in Vichy Syria and Axis Europe . Britain 's obligations to the Jews under the mandate are slurred over , and the White Paper is put forward as the only possible compromise for the Arab-Jewish political controversy in Palestine . " The White Paper , " the study says ingenuously , " demands sacrifices from both sides : the Arabs must recognize the position of the half-million Jews already in the country ; the Jews must be satisfied with what they have and Look elsewhere for a solution of the problem of ? European Jewry . " No compromise solution along bi-national or similar lines is envisaged in this report ; it would have British official opinion believe that the choice is between complete stoppage of Jewish immigration and the establishment of a Jewish state . The Chatham House Middle Eastern experts seem to share Bevin 's hope that the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without opening the doors of Palestine . " There seems good reason to believe , " the study says optimistically , " that the consequences of a restoration of reasonable conditions in other parts of the world would be a substantial re-immigration a Jews from Palestine . " One can just see the Polish Jews streaming back . The Chatham House report is anti-Zionist but hardly pro-Arab , except on the one narrow issue of a Jewish honietand . Characteristically , the report indicates a wistful belief that if the White Paper is carried out and Jewish immigration and Jewish land purchases , in Palestine are shut off , the Arabs there would be willing to accept " a postponement or at least a very gradual fulfilment " of the White Paper 's further promise of a self-governing independent state in Palestine . The Cairo experts of Chatham House are full of pious observations on the failure of the French to comport themselves in Syria and the Lebanon in accordance with the Atlantic Charter . They are pro-Arab as against the French and pm-Arab as against the Jews , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British-controlled areas . The experts envisage the building of an Arab bloc at the expense of the French and the Jews but hardly at the expense of British interests . They favor Arab unity , but under British control . They say that Britain " must be in a position to make unfettered military use of the Arab countries during a war , and to deny such use to her enemies or those who might become her enemies . " They say that Britain must have the right " to use the harbors and aerodromes of the Arab countries " and to control the main lines of communic-atiori across them , including the ' oil pipe-lines . " Neither her military nor her economic position can be assured , " the Caine experts say , " unless the Arab countries , or at least those of them in which her main interests lie , are subject to stable governments which are either themselves under British control or are friendly and willing to conform their policy to hers in matters of727 concern . " Few Arab nationalists would regard that as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not contend that Britain " should , even if she could , try to make the Arab world as much her exclusive concern as for example , India . " They say that neither the Arabs nor the other great powers would permit that , Furthermore- , " it would be too great a strain on British resources . " They propose a system of bases in the Arab countries under a kind of international trusteeship . " This does not mean , " the experts hasten to add , " that the actual occupation should be carried out by a group of powers ; such mixed enterprises are not likely to be successful . What it means is that Great Britain should act as trustee on behalf , for example , of a Middle Eastern Commission , which itself would be responsible to the all-embracing international authority . " Thus international authority would be used to ease that strain on British resources . The new United Nations Organization would come in handy in another way . The new Arab ; ; fates in this scheme would be guaranteed " equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations give up something of their sovereignty to an international authority , " the Caird experts explain , " the Arabs will no longer claim that their sovereignty should be unrestricted . " Thus imperialism would take on the trappings of internationalism . In this grandiose plan for British control of the Middle East the Jews and the French also have a place  --  as burnt offerings to ' Arab nationalism . The Chatham House experts say the policy they have outlined " would probably be indorsed by most reputable British officials ' fare there any other kind ? in the Middle East . " It would also " be accepted by the wiser and more intelligent of the Arab leaders . " Unfortunately , " there are other leaders , and with them a large proportion of the rank and file , who have been so embittered by British policy in the last twenty-five years that they are no longer willing to cooperate with Great Britain , " Britain must help the moderates to gain ascendancy , but this can only be done if - certain immediate issues are settled satisfactorily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vital , obviously , are those of Palestine and of Syria and Lebanon . " The Palestine solution , as we have already seen , is to stop Jewish immigration and land purchase . In Syria and Lebanon it is to persuade the French not to " insist on being given a position similar to that of Great Britain in Iraq . " This is as frank as it is funny . Elsewhere in this study we are told that the Anglo-Egyptian and Anglo-lraqian treaty.relationship " is now the official model for British dealings with the Arabs , " and similar treaties are proposed with the other Arab states . What makes the Cairo experts think British restrictions on Arab independence would be any less palatable than French ? Is the anti-British feeling in Egypt any weaker than the anti-French feeling in Syria ? Politically , this program makes no sense . One does not need many days in Egypt to discover that the Anglo-Egyptian , treaty relationship is hardly a fit model for British relations with the Arab states . The Arabs want some kind of federation and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effendis , pashas , kinglets , and sheiks as the tools of the British will not satisfy them . The " " moderates " on whom the Cairo experts rely are not genuine moderates . They are political potentates and landowners who are more fearful of 728 popular unrest in their own countries than of the British . They want to see British supervision continued , to protect them and their privileges against popular demand for reform and change . They share British imperial phobias about the Soviet Union , and they are considerably less progressive even than the right wing of the British Colonial Office . Men of Sir Walter Smart 's type are well aware of the social conflicts brewing in the Middle East , and see the need for some measure of reform . But reform is reform at the expense of the big landowner . " If we begin to press the effendis for reform , " one British official said , " they 'll ask , ' What 's the difference , then , between you and the Bolsheviks ? ' " You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab world and expect social reform  --  or stability . Britain has no right to rule the Arab world . But it does The NATION have a legitimate interest in communications and oil . That interest will best be preserved by an international solution of the Palestine problem . A growing Jewish community there will continue to dissolve feudal Arab relationships , to raise living standards , and to make reform inevitable . If Arab fears are stilled by insistence on a bi-national Palestine instead of a Jewish state , if Arab aspirations are satisfied by the inclusion of a bi-national Palestine in an Arab federation , if Arab and Jew are helped by a United Nations program for land , water , and power development in the Middle East , the " slum " can be reclaimed , the old sore point of world politics healed , the Jews given a home , the Arabs given a break . This way , and not in disingenuous power politics , nineteenth-century style , lie peace and stability for the Middle East .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
