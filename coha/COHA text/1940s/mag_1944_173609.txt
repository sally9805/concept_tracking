Presidential Secretary Steve Early and a little group of White House employes and pressroom regulars clustered in the President 's office one noon last week . Mr. Roosevelt buzzed for Assistant Secretary William D. Hassett . Lank , grey , stooped Bill Hassett , 64 , got a little flustered , for the President abruptly announced that this was a court-martial ; that he , Bill , had been accused of using some very bad language and the group was gathered to see how good a swearer he really was . Forthwith joke-loving Franklin Roosevelt handed Bill Hassett a commission as full presidential secretary , to succeed the late Marvin Mclntyre . <P> Bill Hassett is a Washington institution . Born in Northfield , Vt. , he started his Washington newspaper career in 1909 , worked decades as a newspaperman before shifting to a job with NRA and on to the White House . A kindly , gregarious , infallibly obliging gentleman of the old school , Bill Hassett rather likes being called a Victorian . He is deeply versed in English and American history and literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only five blocks from the White House . <P> In recent years Secretary Hassett has subbed frequently for Steve Early as press secretary , especially on the grueling train trips which Early dislikes . But his prime value to the President has been as all-round literary choreman , helping compose some of the most felicitous of Presidential letters , touching up the Presidential speeches and supplying apt quotations and historical facts . One of his prized possessions is an autographed photograph of the President inscribed : " To Bill Hassett -a rare combination of Roget , Bartlett and Buckle . "
