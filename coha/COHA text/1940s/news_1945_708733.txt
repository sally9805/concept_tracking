txt Tonight in Boston probably will be just another warm summer nightfall , to most people . Most likely they 'll remark again , " It is n't the heat , it 's the humidity ! " and let it go at that . But in ancient places , sacred to forgotten pagan faiths , from the jungles to the lands where Druids held forth , the sun dipping below the horizon will be in line with symbolic stones , altars or apertures , in a way which long ago would have been marked by one of the great festivals of the year . The sun , in fact , will have reached the northern limit of its apparent travels ? meaning that the shortest nights and longest days in the northern hemisphere are with us once more . The days this week are all an equal 15 hours and two minutes from sunrise to sunset , for though sunrise gets a little later , so does sunset . To be more or less exact  --  to the nearest minute , anyway  --  sunrise has been at 5:14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a minute to 5:15 and continues there until Sunday . But the sun 's minute later rising tomorrow is balanced by a minute later . sunset , which will be at 8:17 for the rest of the week , after keening to an 8:16 schedule for the first three days . In the old days this was known as midsummer week , for the days were the longest , the sun was apt to be the hottest as well as the highest in the heavens , and three warm , leafy months lay behind and three lay ahead . But modern astronomical , arbitrary divisions of the seasons , place the beginning of summer officially at 2:52 tomorrow afternoon , when the sun passes overhead on the Tropic of Cancer , in the so-called " Summer Solstice. " - Bonfires Lit . The best-known reminder of some of the features of long-forgotten midsummer festivals at this season , is Shakespeare 's " Midsummer Night 's Dream . " But in certain features of Saint John 's Eve , as celebrated this coming Saturday night in some lands still , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve festivals . The tact is , according to the history hooks and encyclopedias , that the adoption and emasculation of this ancient pagan festival into the Christian church calendar , was never very complete in : medieval Britain . for one example . It continued to be known mainly as Midsummer Eve , rather than Saint John 's Eve . On the streets and in market ) laces bonfires were lit , and torchlight processions in the ordinarily unlighted streets brought out those of high and low degree for what was more or less of an ail-night procession or carnival eventually . From far-off roots the belief had sprung and survived that sleep was out of the question on this night of nights , and that fire was somehow essential . Authorities on folk lore and customs incline to think this was a survival of sun-worship , with the sun revered as the source of life in summer crops . An important feature of the celebration was a jumping through the flames of a large bonfire . R. Chambers ' " Book of Days " says of this : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the men and boys occasionally jumping through it , not to show their agility , but as a compliance with ancient , custom . There can be no doubt that this leaping through the fire is. one of the most ancient of all known superstitutions , and is identical with that followed by Manasseh . We learn that , till a late period , the practice was followed in Ireland on St. John 's Eve . " The Manasseh mentioned by Chambers is the Biblical character referred to in IT Kings , - 16 , verse ** he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yea , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen . whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel . " There are other scriptural references to this custom , and in Deuteronomy 18. verse 10 , the practice is specifically prohibited . The " Book of Days " lists many another-strange superstition . and custom , associated with Midsummer , or St. John 's , Eve . Fire was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may have been rather more attractive in the cooler summer nights of northern Europe and the British Isles . than it would be today in Boston . A more popular observance of the occasion=or of any other hot night in New England ? is undoubtedly choice of ' a cool place to sleep , instead of celebrating , preceded possibly by a moonlight dip in cool waters . instead of any hot jumping through flames .
