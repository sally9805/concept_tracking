With the announcement that it was offering its 509,550 common shares of National Bank of Detroit stock for sale to the public , General Motors Corp . last week wrote an end to one of the strangest careers in banking history . <P> General Motors jumped into the banking business in March 1933 . Virtually every bank in Detroit had been closed for six weeks . All business was at a near standstill . Even rich G.M. , which had had some $19,000,000 of its cash impounded , was in a fix . Finally , to the $12,500,000 which the Reconstruction Finance Corp . subscribed to start a new bank , G.M. added a like amount ( to buy all the common stock at $25 a share ) . Together they helped break Detroit 's financial paralysis . <P> Success Story . G.M. 's National Bank was a success from the start . Big &; little depositors , some of whom had taken their money from other banks and hoarded it , flocked in to establish accounts amounting to $11,538,339 on the first day of business . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $189,693,074 in deposits . <P> But G.M. , which had firmly announced that it would play town banker for the emergency only , was still reluctant . Promptly after the March 24 opening , the auto makers had offered all their shares to the public at cost . They sold only 111,186 shares . <P> Obviously G.M. was in the banking business for a good long stay ; fortunately it had called in a topflight banker to nurse the depression baby . <P> As president , G.M. installed calm , hefty Walter Scott McLucas , then 57 , whose banking record in New York and Kansas City glittered with successes . ( He is now chairman of National 's board . ) <P> Bailing Out . Among the Detroit banks that had closed for good &; all were the giant First National and the Guardian . Banker McLucas helped them to return to strapped customers some 30% of their $600 million in frozen deposits . <P> Slowly but steadily , the RFC money was repaid until , at the outbreak of World War II , the Government held but $8,750,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As deposits doubled &; redoubled , somewhat surprised General Motors executives found that their bank , which they still planned to abandon at the end of the emergency , had become the keystone of Detroit 's financial structure . <P> Last week , G.M. 's National was the 13th largest bank in the U.S. , with total deposits of over a billion dollars . But G.M. , still anxious to get back to its mechanical last , nevertheless unloaded the biggest controlling block of bank common stock ever to be offered publicly in a single transaction . It found eager buyers , since even at $42 National stock was a good deal . Nobody minded G.M. 's profit of over 100% . The emergency was over .
