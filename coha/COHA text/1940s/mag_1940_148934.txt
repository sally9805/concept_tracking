Three years ago Maine 's salty Republican Senator Wallace Humphrey White Jr. , grandfather of FCC , took a squint at the nation 's ethereal affairs , promptly clamored loudly for a Senate investigation of radio networks and of his grandchild . But before Senate guns could be trained on the agency , Franklin Roosevelt whisked lively little Trouble Shooter Frank Ramsay McNinch of the Federal Power Commission to the chairmanship of FCC . Chairman McNinch cut out a lot of FCC deadwood , then began an investigation of the whole radio industry . <P> Soon FCC findings on super power set 50 Kw. as the maximum strength for commercial transmission . Not so rapid was the progress of FCC 's monopoly-investigating committee , first presided over by Chairman McNinch , later by fat-jowled , cautious Thaddeus Harold Brown , Republican wheel horse of the Commission . Starting in November 1938 , with NBC 's David Sarnoff as its first witness , the committee rambled on until the following May . Then it began to brood . Not until last week did it make known the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tycoon gibbering to the hills . <P> The committee found undertones of monopoly all through the $165,000,000-a-year ( 1938 ) broadcasting industry . Whacking NBC and CBS around without gloves , FCC-men charged them with " many arbitrary and inequitable practices . " Grimly they pointed out : <P> That of the 660 standard U. S. broadcasting stations operating in 1938 , over half were on the three major networks , including practically all high-powered U. S. stations . <P> That outlet stations were contractually hog-tied to one network , prevented from broadcasting in their areas many programs the public wanted . <P> That many large corporations , controlling independently owned broadcasting stations through networks , were themselves controlled through proxy voting by a handful of people . The committee declared that R. C. A. , which owns NBC , " is controlled by three persons who between them have only 5,829 shares of a total of 9,864,502 voted by them . " <P> That NBC and CBS were giving their 253 independently owned outlets a financial tossing around , distributing among them only $12,267,560 of the $44,313,778 received for time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full FCCommission , the committee recommended : <P> &gt;Sterner Governmental supervision of the networks . <P> &gt;Revision of network contracts with outlet stations , allowing station owners more say in the selection of programs , bigger chunks of the profits . <P> Just after filing his monopoly report last week , up for reappointment came Commissioner Brown . He faced unexpected opposition . New Hampshire 's blatant Senator Tobey ignored his party line to belabor a fellow Republican . Equipped with a portfolio crammed with documents , Tobey bellowed a demand for facts concerning a " wild party " given in New York by WMCA 's President Donald Flamm , and attended by Brown . When Brown refused to discuss the affair , Tobey leered and boomed : " And is it true that one of the men at the party ran his hand up a woman 's leg ? " Later on Brown privately revealed that Flamm was a friend of long standing , that the party ( given at Billy Rose 's Diamond Horseshoe ) was fit for a " mother or sister .
