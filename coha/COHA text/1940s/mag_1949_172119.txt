On a stretch of Manhattan 's lower East Side once ridden with slums , the clean , monotonously similar buildings of Stuyvesant Town stand as a symbol of housing progress . They are also a symbol of the North 's brand of Jim Crow . <P> Negroes have been barred from the 8,700-apartment development since it was built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. with some generous financial help from New York City ( the city condemned the property so that Metropolitan could buy it easily , exempted the company from real-estate taxes on the new buildings for 25 years ) . Three Negro veterans , denied apartments , went to court . They argued that the city itself was encouraging racial discrimination . <P> Last week , New York State 's highest court , by a 4-10-3 vote , upheld Metropolitan 's Jim Crow policy . The Negroes ' next stop : the U.S. Supreme Court .
