txt A fullscale test by John L. Lewis of the Taft-Hartley labor law appeared to be shaping up as the number of miners idle in a four-day-old strike protesting the law mounted to 250 , - 000 tonight . The walkout , which began less than an hour after the bill became law , continues to be termed by many district leaders of the United Mine Workers , AFL , as " unauthorized , " but the general attitude in the mining industry and among many of the miners themselves was that the showdown would start on July 8 . In Washington President Truman said he himself contemplated no action now in the coal situation but that the Attorney General was studying it . The Senate heard Edward Martin , Republican , of Pennsylvania , assail the UMW , and Wayne Morse , Republican , of Oregon , defend it . It is on July 8 that the 400,000 soft coal miners are scheduled to return to work , following a tenday official vacation that begins at midnight tomorrow night . Very few persons , both in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mined that day and for some time afterward . The reason would be the lack of a contract , with the miners , even without any official word from the UMW leadership , following their traditional policy of " no contract ? no work . " The present interim wage agreement with the Federal Government expires at midnight Monday night , simultaneously with the return of the mines to the operators with the expiration of the SmithConnally Act . The mines were seized thirteen months ago as a means of ending a wage strike . Although some of the mine oper- ators have been conferring privately in Washington about the possibility of reaching an agreement with Mr. Lewis , no meetings have been scheduled with the union 's leader . Thus , as each day passea the time to settle the differences ' between the owners and the UMW grows shorter . Both coal industry and union spokesmen here are in agreement that drawing up a new wage pact by July 8 would be a difficult task . While they do not rule out entirely the possibility , they point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed when the oper-1 ators and Mr. Lewis broke off their talks on May 31 . Although Mr. Lewis has not publicly staated his wage demands , operators said he had asked a 1$1.20-a-day wage increase , besides a reduction of hours , including portal time , from nine to eight hours . This would include a halfhour lunch period as against the present fifteen minutes . Counter-Offer Much Lower The operators figured that the pay increase and the reduced working hours would amount to an increased labor cost of 35 cents an hour . They countered with an eight-hour day , with a basic rate of $11.35 or 50 cents under the present scale for nine hours . The counter-offer is equivalent to 15 cents an hour , thus resulting in a spread of 20 cents an hour separating the principals . Mr. Lewis also asked for a 10-cent-aton royalty for a health and welfare fund . Therefore , to grant all the demands , according to the operators , they would have to increase the price of coal 70 cents a ton to break even . Rumors of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close check of retail coal merchants and mine owners failed to verify it . Meanwhile , the choking off of about 1,500,000 of the daily production of 2,000,000 tons of coal bit into steel production for the second consecutive day . The Sharon Steel Corporation announced I that it had banked one of two blast furnaces and four out of ten open hearth furnaces at the Farrell ( Pa. ) works . This brought to the equivalent of 11% blast furnaces , having a daily pig iron output of about 9,000 tons , either banked or in the process of being shut down by three companies  --  Sharon , Youngstown Sheet and Tube and Carnegie-Illinois Steel , the largest operating subsidiary of the United States Steel Corporation . Neither Sharon nor Carnegie-Illinois could estimate how many men would be made idle in their mills , but Youngstown estimated that its lay-offs would total 4,000 by Monday . Railroads generally reported a sharp drop in coal shipments in the Pennsylvania-Ohio-West Virginia area , and some train crew lay-offs were in prospect .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
