From the swank Disney Studios in Burbank , Calif , came a new wave of raucous sound effects . It was no sign of new life in Walt 's celebrated cartoon creatures . It sounded more like Donald Duck in a tizzy of indecision . <P> Most of the noise came from representatives of 27 unions protesting last week 's layoff of 450 Disney employes , almost half the studio 's staff . Replied General Manager John F. Reeder : the new pay schedule ( a 25% increase-an estimated $1 million-a-year boost in the payroll ) put into effect on the demand of the Screen Cartoonists Guild would not allow the studio to keep on going full blast with a reasonable hope of profit . Work would have to stop , said he , on all but four feature productions ( Song of the South , Fun and Fancy Free , How Dear to My Heart , All in Fun ) . Workers on all other projects would have to go . <P> Actually the situation had been boiling up for years . Since 1940 , cartoon costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs ) while revenues have increased only 12% . Distributors have cold-shouldered efforts to increase rentals , which are still at the 1940 rate . Full-length cartoons , for all the fanfare about them , have only dug the hole deeper . As a result , most cartoonmakers ( e.g. , Lantz , Pal , Quimby , Selzer ) are wondering how long they can go on . <P> Some of them hope to last for a while with the support of the big studios with which they are allied . But Disney , who has a genius for running up costs , is an independent . He now owes about $4 million to banks , has $7.5 million sunk in current productions . His average shorts , which cost $60,000 to $65,000 to produce and over $25,000 for prints , advertising and distribution , gross only $75,000 to $90,000 over a five-year period . Unless some drastic adjustments are made , Donald , along with his cartoon cousins , might soon be a stuffed Duck .               @ @ @ @ @ @
