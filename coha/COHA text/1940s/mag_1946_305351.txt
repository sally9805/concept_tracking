At Chicago 's Billings Hospital , 97 men &; women suffering from severe stomach and intestinal ulcers have submitted during the past three years to a revolutionary operation for their disorder . Its discoverer : Dr. Lester Reynold Dragstedt , gentle , stooped professor of surgery at the University of Chicago Medical School . His operation : opening the patient 's chest above the diaphragm , cutting the two vagus nerves where they lead to the stomach and intestines . <P> Of the 97 Billings patients , all but two were cured of their ulcers . One of the failures died of bronchial pneumonia after the operation ; the other , a neurotic , thought it did not help . <P> By last week Dr. Dragstedt 's operation , now tested by many another surgeon , had stirred plenty of interest among ulcer specialists . Because peptic ulcers may recur in five-year cycles , Dr. Dragstedt and other investigators were not yet ready to pronounce the three-year-old operation a permanent cure . But so far , there had been no relapse after a vagus operation . <P> Overstimulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretion of gastric juices in the digestive system . Ulcers result from the secretion of abnormally large amounts of gastric acid . The normal stimulus for gastric secretions is eating . What puzzled Dr. Dragstedt was the fact that ulcer patients secrete large amounts between meals , especially at night , without any obvious stimulus . <P> Doctors have long suspected that stomach ulcers , popularly considered an occupational disorder of business executives , doctors , taxi drivers , newsmen and others who work under stress , have their root in the nervous system . If so , Dr. Dragstedt reasoned , overstimulation of the nerves must somehow be responsible for the abnormal secretions of gastric acid . When he tested his theory , he discovered that the operation did indeed greatly reduce the amount of gastric juice in the digestive system . Cutting the vagus nerves just above the stomach slows digestion , but seems to have no serious effect on other organs . <P> Men with a History . About 80% of all ulcers respond to medical treatment-e.g. , a mild , unstimulating diet-and a change to a less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of ulcerated sections of the stomach or intestines , but often new ulcers break out after the operation . All the vagotomy cases were in this stubborn group . <P> After a vagus operation , ulcers heal rapidly , the stomach quiets down and the patient leaves the hospital within twelve days . At Massachusetts General Hospital , Surgeon Francis D. Moore reported that vagotomy is especially effective for young or middle-aged men with a long history of peptic ulcers . Nonetheless , Drs . Dragstedt , Moore , et al. , advise the operation only after diet and other treatments have failed . For nervous stomachs and the " tensions and strains of modern life , " says Dr. Dragstedt , preventive psychoanalysis may be better than nerve-cutting.
