It was just a ten-minute talk at a Rutgers convocation , but long enough for the speaker , Philosopher Houston Peterson , to peddle a provocative thought . Why did n't everyone at Rutgers read one good book a year-the same good book ? Added Peterson : " On a university campus , we ought to have more to talk about than football , girls and the Russians . " <P> Last week everybody on the New Jersey campus , from President Robert C. Clothier to the newest freshman ( and including secretaries and janitors ) , was tackling the first " Book of the Year " : Anthropologist Ruth Benedict 's Patterns of Culture . The campus Philosophean Society had picked it on Peterson 's say-so : he called it " a noble , beautiful , important book . " If they get through the first one , he has some more up his sleeve : Thucydides ' History of the Peloponnesian War , Hamlet , Alice in Wonderland .                  @ @ @
