Agness ( " Aggie " ) Underwood is an uninhibited Los Angeles crime reporter . She has lately been teaching William Randolph Hearst 's granddaughter Phoebe the newspaper business ( TIME , May 27 ) . Last week Aggie gave her Hearstling apprentice a forthright lesson in the care and treatment of city editors . <P> Incensed when City Editor Lou Young of the Los Angeles Herald &; Express canceled her day off , Aggie barged across the city room , proceeded to belabor him about the arms and neck with her handiest weapon-a three-foot barracuda which a fisherman had just given her . City Editor Young heard the laughter , decided it was best to join in.
