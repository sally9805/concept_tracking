txt In a speech delivered 103 years ago , Abraham Lincoln . with amazing foresight , discussed two vital questions , which now absorb the minds of Americans . Pondering dangers which time Might . bring to the country , he envisioned the possibility of invasion by a foreign force . At this he scoffed . In the same speech he forecast the - oming of a man of strong will , overweening ambition , and towering genius . who would attempt to pull down the national " edifice of liberty and equal rights " ? pull it clown , said Lincoln , even at the cost of " enslaving free men . " Called an Instance of Prescience . The speech was called to THE TRIarNE 's attention by a Lincoln authority who regards it , because of its astounding aptness , as " one of the most startling instances of prescience in hist ory . " At the time he delivered it , Lincoln was 28 years old ? at the halfway point in his life . He was a member of the Illinois house of representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Lyceum , a Springfield club , wanted to " look him over , " as an authority puts it , and invited him to address them . He spoke on Jan. 27 , 1837 . Lincoln chose to gaze soberly far into the future on that January evening is not known . However , his deep love of country already had manifested itself . He was concerned then , as later , with the great problem of the preservation of the Union , and the depth of his concern is made apparent by the searching character of his speech . Pays a Tribute to America . On that winter evening . of 1837 Lincoln gave to his " remarks of the evening , " as he called them , the title : " The Perpetuation of our Political Institutions . " He opened his address with a stirring tribute to the richness of America and the freedom it offered . He declared Americans to be in " the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth " and described " these fundamental bless:ngs " as a " legacy bequeathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lamented and de- , parted , race of ancestors . " Liberty and equal rights had been istiaianteed by the founding fathers , ne said , and the task of transmitting these rights had been forever left to those who should follow . The speaker then turned to the main subject of his discourse . Poses Some Questions . " How then shall we perform it ? " Lincoln asked , referring to the task so dear to his heart  --  the preservation of the republic and its institutions . " At what point shall , we expect the approach of danger ? By what means shall we fortify against it ? Shall we expect some transAtlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow ? 4 Never ! Ail the armies of Europe , Asia , and Africa combined , with all . the treasures of the earth our own C3:CePtedi in their military chest , with a Bonaparte for a commander , could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge In the trial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Is the approach of danger to be expected ? I answer , if it ever reach us , it must spring up amongst us ; it can not come from abroad . If destruction be our lot , we must ourselves ho its author and finisher . As a nation of freemen we must live thru all time , or die by suicide . Foresees " Men of Ambition . " " It Is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true , to suppose that men of ambition and talfills will not continue to spring up amongst us . And when they do , they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them . " The question then is , can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others ? . Most , cer ? tainlY it can not . Many great and good men , sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake , may ever he found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rential chair ; but such belong not to the family of the lion , or the brood of the eagle . " What ! Think you these places would satisfy an Alexander , a Cresar , or a Napoleon ? Never ! Sketches the Characteristics . " Towering genius disdains a beaten path . It seeks regions hitherto unexplored . It secs no distinction In adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others . " It denies that it Is glory enough to serve under any chief . It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor , however illustrious . It thirsts and burns for distinction ; and , If possible , it will have it , whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen . " Is it unreasonable , then , to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius , coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to the utmost stretch , will at some time spring up amongst us ? And when such Em one does It will require the people to be united with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and generally intelligent , to successfully frustrate his designs . Sets Forth a Probable Case . " Distinction will be his paramount object , and altho he would as willingly , perhaps more so , acquire it by doing good as harm , yet , that opportunity , being past , and nothing left to be done in the way of building up , he would set boldly to the task of pulling down . " Here , then , is a probable case , highly dangerous , and such ' an one as could not have welt existed heretofore . " Lincoln 's advice to the country , given in the same speech , was : " Reason  --  cold , calculating , unim ? passioned reason  --  must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense . " Let those materials be molded into general Intelligence , sound morality , and , in particular , a reverence for the constitution and laws . " Upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest. , as the rock of its basis ; and as truly as has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates of hell shall not prevail against it . ' "
