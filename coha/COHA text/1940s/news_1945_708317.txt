txt YOUR mention of the CBS proposal for better television pictures on higher frequencies in " Highlights of the Year " on Dec. 31 was gratifying . So was your verdict that " in itself this was a real public service . " It seems too bad that your praise needed  --  and I agree it needed  --  the qualification that this subject has of late assumed the character of a " you 're another brawl . " Because this reproach was coupled with my name and the CBS name , and no other name , I fear a wrong inference has been created . May . I. point out that the " brawl " has ; tome from opponents of the CBS proposal for vastly improved television pictures . As early as last May , a month after we issued our challenge , I publicly renounced and deplored " the battle of words " which our ideas had generated . At a meeting of the Television Press Club , I said : " I hope we have seen the : ad of angry argument and will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect the kind of television which wartime electronics has made possible . " I think if you will check the record you will find that half a dozen " blasts " have been issued by others against the progress we propose , for every rebuttal we have been forced , by such attacks , to issue . We agree completely with you that the better ? ctures themselves will settle the argument , and have committed hundreds of thousands of dollars to getting them on the air at the earliest possible moment . Last Sunday in an article on the progress made in " Technical Matters " in 1944 the writer ended by citing one thing in which no progress had been made : servicing the home radio . The American radio industry has been derelict in the matter of servicing from the beginning . Why not set up now some organization to make sure it does n't happen after the war ?
