Congressman Robert L. ( " Muley " ) Doughton of North Carolina last week had lived to see a historic phenomenon in Washington . Up before Congress , in election year , was a hefty Federal tax bill . The proposed taxes-an estimated $656,000,000 worth-were for National Defense . The press applauded , cried in effect : " Tax us more ! " Congressmen bickered only over details , did not question the need for new taxes . Said Muley Doughton , explaining this miracle : " Everybody is so patriotic . " <P> What made the taxes historic on a second count was that they represented the first real effort by the Roosevelt Administration to arrange the payment of a debt before the money was borrowed . Muley Doughton ( as chairman of the House Ways &; Means Committee ) and Mississippi 's Pat Harrison ( Senate Finance Committee ) sold lukewarm Franklin Roosevelt on this departure from New Deal practice , then wrote the President 's ideas into " a bill to provide for the expenses of national preparedness . . . . " Sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere drop in the enormous bucket of Defense . <P> What the bill meant to 3,500,000 Federal income taxpayers ( corporate and individual ) was a 10% supertax , for five years starting next March 15 , to be added to the amount normally payable . Anticipated additional revenue : $226,000,000 . Rest of the $656,000,000 is to come from upped levies on distilled spirits ( $91,000,000 ) ; beer ( $46,000.000 ) ; gasoline ( from 1 to 1 per gallon , $112,000,000 ) ; cigarets ( up 1 per pack , $77,000,000 ) ; amusements ( tickets costing 31 or more will be taxed ; present taxable minimum is 41 , $25,000,000 ) ; increases in most other excise taxes ( $76,000,000 ) ; a 20% increase in the tax rates on stock transfers ( $3,000,000 ) . <P> Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau explained to Muley Doughton 's committee why the new taxes are necessary . Even before the President upped his emergency Defense estimates by $1,000,000,000 plus ( see p. 77 ) , the expected deficit for fiscal 1941 stood at $3,703,000,000 . This prospect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the U. S. Treasury as of last week could borrow only $1,973,000,000 more without cracking the $45,000,000,000 debt limit . In consequence the Secretary , Muley Doughton and Pat Harrison asked Congress to up the limit to $48,000,000,000 , set aside the new taxes specifically to pay off the additional debt . Congress pliantly prepared to do so . But Congress well knew that provision for a mere $3,000,000,000 more debt will be just a starter , that yet to come are the full burdens and disciplines of a grave new world .
