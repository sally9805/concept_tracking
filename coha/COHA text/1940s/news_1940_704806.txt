txt As the war entered its most crucial phase , with German troops occupying the city of Paris , France 's appeal to America for aid has found a specific echo in Britain . In an exclusive interview with The Christian Science Monitor , Mr. Ernest Bevin , Britain 's new " strong man " Minister of Labor and National Service , declared , " We want the United States to fill our orders at once and send out supplies immediately . " Britain- yesterday released unlimited .. funds for purchase of arms in America . With characteristic directness Mr. Bevin said : " Tell the Americans they need n't worry about payments . We are not broke . " " We are willing to fight the battle . We have the men . We have the organization . But our war production will depend on the flow of raw materials . My task is to keep the labor supply always a little ahead of this flow . " Entering a New Phase Mr. Bevin disclosed that with the rapid reorganization of labor and production methods completed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers having sped their machines to the utmost limit at no thought for their own comfort , the time and opportunity have now come to take action so that the personnel is properly rested while the machines are kept running at all hours , to bring in newly trained workers , to provide more machines . For young persons the , provisions of factory acts and the five-day week are soon to be restored and relief parties of women and other nonessential workers are to be brought in to keep the machines running . The men are to have the six-day week restored . " You could say that by the sheer impetuous weight of momentum our production has been increased in the past few weeks at the general level of ' 70 per cent . And that would be a conservative estimate , " Mr. Bevin declared . He stressed that in improvising By a Staff Artist proz : . =.1 Ernest Bevin Britain 's new Minister of Labor and National Service . new methods to meet the crisis in production , methods which seem dictatorial , and indeed enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it wants , and the workers to work where it wants at the speed it wants , there has been no compulsion  --  except in sweeping away certain unethical practices . He made the point that no trade-union rights whatever are threatened . Looking into the future Mr. Bevin declared trade-unionism to be approaching a new era in which it would have permanent responsibility . in the Government . The whole system of industrial government he sees changing too as a result of the war 's impact on established methods . He believes a very different Britain will emerge from the war , a Britain planned and planning . One-Man Industrial Revolution Beside the effect of the new structure on the methods of government Mr. Bevin declares that the war has raised two issues which are bound vitally to influence the shape of things to come  --  evacuation , with its revealing searchlight on living conditions in industrial centers , and appreciations by the State of immense national capital value of skill , in the past allowed to waste through unemployment . In his lofty office in Montague House in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing and where his own working hours are often 5 a . In. to 11 p. m. , this erstwhile truck driver is directing a one-man industrial revolution . He believes that he is building on firm foundations . Mr. Bevin 's industrial revolu- lion is bold but it is simple . It works through existing machinery ? to a great extent , through trade-unions , employers ' organizations , and through the National Employment Exchanges which exist in each town . Direction at the top has been added by Mr. Bevin through a council of production which meets three times weekly , and makes its requirements known immediately by telegram to the area boards , and through a system of inspection at the base to insure that man power is used both fully and carefully . " The workmen themselves now appreciate that they are employed by the State , " Mr. Sevin pointed out . " They do n't think of themselves as belonging to one factory . and so if need be when one plant is temporary idle we can and do transfer skilled workers to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Tool Room Standard Raised " I started in arranging transfers during my first day here . And such action is largely responsible for the very greatly increased aircraft production which we have attained . " Then I have given new technical status to the tool room . It is now on a higher plane than the belt . In this way skilled men such as diemakers are not lured away to production shops where previously they have been able to earn much greater pay . Craftsmen have flocked back to the tool room and I have increased my production very much . " With new legislation enforced early this week ( obliging engineering employers to engage labor only through an etnployment exchange or an approved trade-union arrangement ) we are cutting those heavy losses normally due to excessive turnover of labor in industry . And so far I have not had one single complaint . " Peacetime Salvage Seen I asked Mr. Bevin how much of the wartime production structure he thought could usefully remain in peacetime . " A great deal , " he replied with emphasis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are building up experience now and we must go forward . Many basic industries are undergoing a complete change . Then look how transport is planned and controlled ; it can not be returned to its old state . " I think the production council is a big advance and will remain to play an important part in solving problems that - demobilization will bring . " With regard to unemployment Mr. Bevin stressed forcibly that in his opinion out of unemployment has already come an important realization of the capital value of skill . " Owing to unemployment we in Britain now know we have wasted skill of greater value than our whole gold reserves . A craftsman is a ? 20,000 capital asset . In coal alone I have lost 300,000 skilled miners . If I had them at this minute I could nullify the effect of the German invasion of Belgium . A general appreciation of these things- will be bound to have a solid effect in the future . "                  @ @ @
