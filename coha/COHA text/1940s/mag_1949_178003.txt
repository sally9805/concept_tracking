John and Margaret Perkins of the University of Michigan decided that the nation knew far too little about the presidents its colleges &; universities were getting . They decided to make a survey of their own . Last week , in School and Society , they told what they had found out about the heads of 84 state and land-grant colleges . <P> A good many of the 84 , they found , had apparently decided early about their future . One out of four had majored in education at college . The next largest number had specialized in social or physical sciences ; only six had picked the humanities ; of the whole group only half had taken a Ph.D . <P> Most ( 77% ) had gone to eastern colleges , and three out of ten had earned a degree at the institutions they later headed . Of the 35 southern colleges &; universities , 32 had chosen a southerner for president . <P> About 40% of the presidents had once worked at something besides education . The University of Kansas picked a vice president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were a physician , a dirt farmer , two journalists , a rear admiral and a former state governor . <P> But most ( 77% ) had done some teaching , and 83% had been some sort of executive on the college level ( one out of four had been a dean ) . <P> The average president , conclude the Perkinses , has taught about eight years , been an administrator for another eight , became a president at 45 , has now been in office about six years . There was not a woman in the lot .
