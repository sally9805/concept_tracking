txt ALBANY , Dec. ** years of uninterrupted domination of the State government by the Democratic party will end the coming week when Thomas E. Dewey takes the oath of office as Governor on Friday . The last Republican to stand in the place which Mr. Dewey will assume was Nathan L. Miller , elected over Alfred E. Smith in the Harding landslide of 1920 . However , there the parallel ends , since Mr. Miller 's election in no sense constituted the termination of an era of long-held power . Democrats and Republicans had held the executive power almost alternately in the previous decade . The effect on the Democratic party of the results of the last election are not clear . but some factors are apparent . The first is that for the first time since 1916 the Democrats are out of power in both the New York . City and State administrations . By a coincidence they held then , as they do now , control of the National Administration . Opposition Lacking Funds Another factor is that the party organization appears to be without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the incoming Republican State administration , and the La Gaurdia city administration , even if war conditions permitted it and public interest made it worth while . A third factor is that leadership of the party in the State is in doubt , for the first time in many years . Alfred E. Smith dominated his party here while he was Governor , Franklin D. Roosevelt won control completely just about the time he was getting used to the White House , and Herbert H. Lehman , Mr. Roosevelt and James A. // DEMOCRATIC ERA ENDING AT ALBANY // Farley shared working control in some of the years that followed . Now , the split between the President and Mr. Farley which flared up in the last State convention , is bound t ' remain open in the period before the choosing of delegates to ' the 1944 Democratic National Convention , with Mr. Farley apparently committed to a non-Roosevelt delegation from the State . Governor Charles Poletti , who is retiring from office , assumed new prominence in the State picture I when , to the surprise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came close to reelection as lieutenant governor in a Republican year . Mr. Poletti has announced no plans . but is is assumed that he will not drop contact completely with government and politics . As the most recent leading vote-getter of the party he should be in the picture for future nominations , possibly for Senator in 1944 or governor in 1946 . The turning over of the Governor 's office to the Republicans , who will also control both Houses of the Legislature With ample margins , ' leaves the Democrats in poorer position , as the party of the opposition , than the Republicans have been . This is because the leadership in State government rested , on the Democratic side , in the executive chamber , rather than in legislative halls , while on the Republican side , through necessity , leadership was developed in both the Assembly and Senate chambers . The Republicans , controlling the legislative purse-strings , were able to set up research bureaus which yielded dividends in the long run . . The Democrats , trying the same thing , would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican side , Mr. Dewey 's patronage policy is already under scrutiny . It is reported that the Governor - elect does not intend to turn over key Cabinet posts to purely political appointees , but that these will get the posts of deputies , secretaries , etc . This is more or less in line with what happened , with exceptions , of course , under the Lehman Admin-1 istration and should be satisfactory to the Republican organizations . There are more deputies I and secretaries in each department than there are commissioners . Mr. Dewey has emerged as the complete leader of his party in the State and should have no difficulty in adhering to whatever policy on Patronage he has laid down . As previously reported , he does not intend to fill all posts now held by Democrats during his *first few weeks in office . It may even be well along in the 1943 session of the Legislature before some appointments are sent to the Senate for confirmation . By following this policy Mr. Dewey will not only be able to fulfill his pledge of careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the posts , but also to tighten his leadership of the party . He has stated several times that he intends to serve his full term as Governor , which runs until 1946. but despite this , ' most Republicans here regard him as being prominently in the 1944 Presidential picture . They feel that if party prospects are good in 1944 Mr. Dewey cal allow himself to be drafted for the Presidential nomination , while under another set of circumstances he can spike any draft movement and save his run for 1948 . His acs tivities as Governor , they feel , . will keep him in the " available " class . Mr. Dewey 's inauguration plans have yet to be formally announced here , but it is known that he will arrive in Albany the day before and take the oath privately . so that there will ' be no interim during which the State would be without . a Governor . Mr. Poletti 's term expires at midnight Thursday . Governor Poletti plans to vacate ' the Executive Mansion , which he and his family have occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-can be in readiness for the new occupants .
