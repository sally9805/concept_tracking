txt Orderly trading returned yesterday , for the day at least , to most of the nation 's primary markets as some grain contracts scored modest gains and cotton futures closed strong after a brisk recovery . But in the East a price war over butter raged among the chain groceries , with some near-by independents joining in , to the advantage of some shoppers . The price war over butter , influenced by the weak position of the wholesale butter markets in New York , Chicago and San Francisco , began when the New York division of Safeway Stores , one of the leaders in the price competition of the last ten days , announced that top-grade butter would sell in its , outlets at 86 cents a pound yesterday . The A. &; P. , Grand Union and Dilbert announced cuts to 85 cents , which went into effect at their stores for the Saturday marketing . Independents Drop to 83 Then Bohack 's , without announcement , fired a salvo of its own . This chain sold top grade butter yesterday at 84 cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores near the center of competition joined in the fray , ; offering butter at 83 cents a pound . The 83-cent price is 12 cents under the average price prevailing earlier in the week at retail and 14 cents under the price that prevailed a week ago , according to the surveys of the City Markets Department . An executive of one of the food outlets selling at the 83 to 86 cent level said he had bought the butter on the wholesale market for 87 cents . The minimum mark-up on butter to cover handling costs is 2 cents , so this chain was losing 4 cents or more on every pound it sold at yesterday 's price . Most of the butter being sold at cut prices was bought at levels higher than 87 cents . As the price tumbled 13 cents in a week at wholesale in New York , buyers remained aloof , filling only day-today needs , in expectation of a further drop . On Friday Grade AA butter was quoted nominally at 79 cents a pound but no transactions took place at that figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday it was quoted at 92 cents . The attitude of many retailers was reflected by Julius Spier , manager of a market at 68 East 161st Street , the Bronx . He predicted that butter would be selling at 75 cents a pound within two weeks . Specialists in the wholesale market thought this viewpoint was extreme . Alfred Rich , manager of the Butter and Egg Merchants Association , said the trade had expected a sharp drop because the price was out of line with Chicago earlier in the week , being 51/2 cents higher . But no one expected a 13-cent decline . Says Sellers Got Panicky Albert Lowenfels , an executive of the Hotel Bar Butter Company , said the wholesale price dropped because sellers , unsettled by the actions of other markets , had got panicky . Because of the extreme shortage in butter , the spread had got very , very high , he said , and when production went up a little while demand was falling off the situation produced an extremely violent fluctuation .

For January deliveries in the New York milkshed farmers received a price of $5.31 a hundredweight , 18 cents above the January , 1947 , price . But farmers would be ill-advised to try to get the butter price back up , Mr. Rich believed . Both he and Markets Commissioner Eugene G. Schulz pointed out that butter - is still losing ground to margarine . Butter sales in New York in . the week ending Feb. 7 were only twothirds the five-year average , Mr. Schulz noted . Both Mr. Rich and Mr. Lowen // fels believed that if a price at or near the present levels is maintained , the butter trade will have a chance to compete against margarine , which was impossible at the 92-cent wholesale price . With the slump in fats and oils , the retail price of margarine has come down 2 cents in many stores . Richard D.

The A. &; P. said it would announce reductions on most brands in that area tomorrow . Margarine 2 Cents in Oregon What happens when a retail price war really gets going was demonstrated in Newport , Ore. , when ( margarine was given away for 2 cents a pound before an armed ' truce was declared , according to an Associated Press dispatch . The war started Friday when one market cut prices . As it proceeded , fiftypound sacks of flour , which cost $4.08 wholesale , went at $1.05 . Boys were hired to report changes in window signs , and sound trucks carried retail market bulletins to the customers . When the price war ended yesterday , one market owner said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competitor , it would be on again . A shopper 's reaction was expressed by Mrs. Margaret Groody of 585 East 161st Street , the 3ronx , in a price-cutting meat market at 3212 Third Avenue . " This situation does n't make sense , " Mrs. Groody declared . " One item goes up and another goes down or vice versa . Now it 's dog biscuits that have gone up . " But another of the chains that has been a leader in the price competition in New York , the Grand Union Company , carried the price war into new territory , general meat prices . The chain announced , effective tomorrow , reductions in the prices of twenty-seven meat cuts sold at its 125 stores in the metropolitan area and 195 elsewhere . This chain cut boneless chuck roast of beef , brisket , neck and heel of round 6 cents to 69 cents a pound ; legs of lamb 6 cents to 59 , and veal cutlets 6 cents to 89 .

Previously price cutting in meats had centered on bacon and similar meats , which had been very high . Meat buying continued cautious on the New York wholesale markets . At Omaha , Neb. , C. Y. Thompson , president of the Producers Livestock Marketing Association , asserted that the recent drop in livestock prices would b ing about a drop in cattle production . He told the convention of his organization that " livestock men in this area are afraid of the uncertainty and confusion .

Edward A. Hausman , executive secretary of the Ailboro Retail Fruit Association , compared current wholesale produce prices with those of February , 1947 . He found that a few items , like New York State Mackintosh apples , had only gone- up a little , from $2.65 to $2.75-$3 a box . But most were two and three times higher . California carrots are up from $2.70 to $8 a crate , Texas carrots from $2.21 to $7 . Florida cabbage is up from 78 cents to $2 a fifty-pound sack and Texas cabbage from 92 cents to $2.25 . Broccoli , beets , wax beans , cauliflower , celery , lettuce , green peppers , spinach , green beans and brussels sprouts were on his list of horrible examples , but onions topped them all .
