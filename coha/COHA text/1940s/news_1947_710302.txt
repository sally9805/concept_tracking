txt In Defense of Fort Clinton WILLIAM H. BALDWIN . Letters to The Times In Defense of Fort Clinton Its Service and Its Place in Our History Recalled To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial comment on the old Aquarium at Battery Park is so out a line with the position which this longtime admirer of THE TIMES would expect you to take that I seriously wonder whether it truly reflects the collective thinking of your editorial board . There are many others far better equipped than I to answer the engineering , architectural and historical stupidities with which that comment is filled ; but I would simply like to point out that , for some 8,000,000 pioneers who have contributed to the fiber and fabric of American life , it was the stepping stone to this New World . Its " mixed history 44 4 ' of such dubious interest " happens to include , besides its service for thirty-five years as the immigration station of our principal port , the gala reception to Lafayette when he revisited the United States , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public functions in the bright pattern of our city 's and nation 's development . A fort so designed and placed that the enemy fleet in the War of 1812 did not dare come within gun range of it would seem to be a useful symbol of prevention as the most effective defense . There are many of us who resent so gratuitous a smearing of our history , and I for one am hopeful that you have not said the last word on this matter and that the next word will be more graceful . WILLIAM H. BALDWIN . New York , April 4 , 1947.
