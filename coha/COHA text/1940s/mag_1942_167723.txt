Out of the wreck of Burma last week came Lieut . General Joseph W. Stilwell . When the outside world had last heard of him , " Uncle Joe " and his Chinese Fifth and Sixth Armies were cut off , and had swung north in a , ferocious slash at the back of the Jap . <P> There was no more word until he turned up at the northeastern India frontier leading a motley column . <P> But the Chinese Fifth and Sixth Armies were not with Joe Stilwell . They were still fighting the Jap in Burma , or had filtered back into China , or had disintegrated . Unspoken in India ( and unanswered in the U.S. early this week ) was the question : Why did Uncle Joe Stilwell leave the troops he commanded ? Was it on orders from Washington ? Was it at Gissimo Chiang 's request ? * Was it on his own authority , because the job of commanding Chinese troops who had commanders of their own was too embarrassing ? <P> Said Uncle Joe , with disarming casualness : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting food regularly . " <P> But newsmen knew that another prospect was not so pleasant . The whole military philosophy of fighting the slippery , lightly equipped Jap had to be rewritten . And Uncle Joe had all the notes for the new text , if only he could make other soldiers listen . <P> Later , to correspondents at New Delhi , he expounded a salty preface . Said Uncle Joe : " I claim we got a hell of a beating . We got run out of Burma and it is humiliating as hell . I think we ought to find out what caused it , go back and retake it . ... The Japanese are not supermen . If we go back properly proportioned and properly equipped we can throw them out . " <P> West Pointer Stilwell knew well enough what had got him and his men thrown out . The question was whether he could sell his story to the staff at New Delhi-in time for this war . <P> <P> * General Stilwell said he intended to go back to China and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
