That was in 1908 . Many years afterward , a court judge recorded Ethel 's answer : " Yes , Elmer , but let us wait until you get something to marry on . " <P> Elmer left the mill , went beekeeping in Enniskillen Township , saved and saved . By 1919 Ethel felt that he had saved enough . But now Elmer hung back . He had got religion , felt that marriage to the unconverted Ethel would not be blessed in heaven . Still they kept company . <P> In 1941 , Elmer , by then grown affluent through beekeeping , still hung back . Ethel , all hope gone , haled him to court , sued for breach of promise . Elmer won round one when the judge took the case from the jury . Ethel won round two in the Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Supreme court ordered a new trial . Ethel won again . Last week the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed Elmer 's second plea , rewarded patient Ethel with $7,000 . Elmer pondered whether to pay or appeal once more .
