Sixty-six years ago , Prince Otto von Bismarck 's Germany set up the first national " Sickness Insurance " plan , covering industrial workers . Kaiser Wilhelm I had proclaimed : " The cure of social ills must be sought not exclusively in the repression of Social Democratic excesses , but simultaneously in the positive advancement of the welfare of the working classes . " This state assumption of responsibility has been interpreted by some as farsighted statesmanship , by others as the embryo of the totalitarian state . In any case , it caught on . Today more have some form of public health insurance . In the catalogue : <P> Germany , since Bismark 's day , through Hitler 's regime , and under Allied Occupation , has steadily developed sickness insurance . <P> About 42 million , or 70% of the population , are covered . <P> Premiums are raised through a 6% payroll tax , shared equally by employees and employers . Austria , since 1888 , has copied the German pattern . More than 6,500,000 , or 90% of the population , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers 5 to 6.5% of their wages . Administration is in the hands of semiprivate companies supervised by the government . Sweden , since 1891 , has promoted voluntary sickness and accident insurance . More than half the population , or 4,700,000 , are covered . They pay varying premiums to government-approved societies . The government pays 55% of the societies ' outlay . <P> Nearly all of Sweden 's 3,359 doctors take part . A law already passed , but not effective until 1951 , will make health insurance compulsory . Norway has had health insurance since 1909 , compulsory for all earning less than 9,000 kroner ( $1,800 ) yearly and voluntary for those earning more . <P> About 2,500,000 , or 80% of the population , are covered . <P> Most of the country 's 2,800 doctors are in the plan . A bit more than half the premiums is paid by employees , the remainder by employers and government . Denmark , beginning with health co-operatives in 1891 , has had a compulsory system since 1933 . Of Denmark 's 4,000,000 people , all those over 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperatives and contribute premiums equaling up to $10 yearly . But benefits depend on individual income .

It now covers 30 million , or 75% of the population , including the republic 's President but not its lawyers , doctors and landowning farmers . Regional councils , elected by premium-paying workers and employers , manage the program . <P> Funds are derived from a 12% social security levy on payrolls , half contributed by employees and half by employers .
