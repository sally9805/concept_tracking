The checkered flag dropped . Thirty-three low-slung , supercharged autos growled and pushed for position . On the straightaway , 50-year-old Ralph Hepburn got the pace up to a deafening 168 m.p.h . On the 16th lap , a Fageol Special bucked on the northwest turn , sailed over the wall . During the first hour , 14 cars had to stop at the pits for repairs . <P> The 500-mile Indianapolis Memorial Day race is famed as a testing ground for new auto gadgets . But this race , the first since 1941 , was mostly a contest between patched-up prewar jobs . Only nine of the 33 starters finished . The largest crowd ever to watch a U.S. sport event ( 175,000 people ) saw shy George Robson , 36 , in his third try at Indianapolis , cross the line first . He averaged 114 m.p.h. in his light blue , alcohol-burning Thorne Special . His reward : about $48,000 in prizes and a trip around the world .                 @ @ @ @
