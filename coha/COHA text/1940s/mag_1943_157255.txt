In its 13 months of ups &; downs , of internal bickerings and external frictions , WPB last week moved into an up position . <P> Out was square-jawed Ferd Eberstadt ( TIME , March 1 ) ; the Palace Guard that engineered his ouster was for the moment appeased . For Boss Donald Nelson war production looked 20% rosier than it did the week before . And Charles Edward Wilson , who had suffered under WPB 's divided authority and mind , at last could consolidate his position . <P> This he did by a new scheduling order to which the Army , Navy and Maritime Commission reluctantly agreed . The order ( which Charlie Wilson carefully called a mere codification of proved practices ) specified the degree of control he would have over three classes of materials . It gave him kingly powers to shift war orders , make manufacturers toe his mark . But Charlie Wilson promised the armed services he would use the new powers only in an emergency and with their approval . Thus did he effect a truce with the Army &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications that they would get the request ) that WPB show its good faith by making two new appointments : 1 ) tough , trusted Julius Albert ( " Cap " ) Krug , head of the WPB power section , to run the WPB requirements committee and program adjustment ; 2 ) Sherrod E. Skinner to be in charge of WPB 's industry divisions . Skinner has been in the Army 's S.O.S. four months , was an executive of General Motors ' Oldsmobile . <P> Krug and Skinner the Army regards as men who understand the down-to-earth importance of materials in production , who can guard the flow of war goods , who will see that WPB makes no attempt to control any needed item or say when it is needed . They get along with each other and distrust WPB 's " politicking termites " and " stratospheric thinkers " - i.e. , the Palace Guard . <P> After all the fuss &; feathers in and over WPB , one fact seemed finally to be dawning on its men : WPB was in no position to risk a showdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it take sole responsibility for running the war .
