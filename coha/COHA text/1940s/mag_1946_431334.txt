FOR five years now , uncle Sam has been running a planned economy with the general consent of the public . Not in the Russian sense of " activating " ? to use a pet term of the planners ? the total national product . Ours was a home-grown American brand of planned economy , mothered by necessity and sanctioned by its limitations . Superimposed on our kind of capitalist economy , it functioned without altering the laws of property or abridging the basic freedom of our enterprise . We backed into it , an area at a time , under duress of war , keeping hands off as much as it was safe to . And when the military crisis was past , most of the controls were dropped with enthusiasm . It soon became evident , however , that Uncle Sam could not yet retire from the planning game without a public outcry . In peace not less than in war there were national problems of production that just would not solve themselves . And so we find ourselves , a year after the armistice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits , nylons , homes . To the student of economic trends that may well look like an important milestone . It is certainly unprecedented in this country . The last war had its War Industries Board , but it was shorter-lived and affected a smaller sector of the economy . This time we have had more than a passing brush with the controlled capitalist economy , and we now have seen the public demand it in peacetime with no more dire excuse than the fact that people ca n't get things that they want . Regardless of one 's blood pressure on the subject , the habit may well be taking form , and one day our children may cry for it . Be that as it may , it does not help much to dismiss the planned economy as an unAmerican anteroom to communism into which we may some day be tricked if we do n't watch out . The fact is that , nomenclature aside , we have been living with it for five years , and now that it is about to leave us it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find out about it . For if another emergency arises in which the public demands it , we had better know how to operate it without too much bungling . II AT FIRST blush , the picture one gets of the capitalist economy under control is none too gratifying . It looks for all the world like . a free-for-all between the  | administration and industry , with Congress as the referee and the Consumer the innocent bystander who gets the black eye . Closer scrutiny will reveal , moreover , that whereas the administration is boxing under Marquis of Queensberry rules , industry is wrestling catch-as-catch-can . And that is why Mr. Consumer on the sidelines gets hurt . For the significant fact about the government 's techniques of control was that they ignored the factor of profits , while the industries they were designed to control were primarily motivated by profits . This is no reflection on industry , which was functioning within its proper framework in our economic system . But it did mean that the principal incentive for the business man to comply with the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishable by law . Thus the game was played with each side using different rules : the controllers bent on getting production at stable prices by ukase ; the controlees , equipped with just as good brains and a lot more experience , bent on making as much money as they could without running afoul of the law . Little wonder , then , that things happened which were not on the program . To get a clear view of how this came about , it is best to focus attention on one sector of the arena . The cotton textile industry is an excellent choice for the purpose . It is a basic industry with which the consuming public is intimately concerned , it has experienced government control in peacetime , and it is composed of a multitude of individualistic businesses whose competition-bred resourcefulness and flexibility are a standing challenge to any attempt at control . The story of government control in cotton textiles is necessarily complex , but its objective can be simply stated : insuring the production of the needed items and their sale at safe prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combined operation production control by the WPB and its successor , the CPA , and price control by the OPA . Unlike military combined operations , however , there was no unified command . On the contrary , WPB and OPA differed significantly as to approach , type of personnel , and philosophy . WPB filled its key posts with men from industry , who retained the industry point of view and leaned toward a minimization of controls . OPA , in its formative stage at least , was led by men from academic and government circles whose uninhibited zeal and crusading spirit backfired into distrust by Congress and legislative limitations on their freedom of action . In this context , government control became far from combined in operation . The problem of production control was the maintenance of a balanced flow of cotton textiles to their various end-uses in accordance with their importance . Cotton is a multipurpose fabric whose industrial and agricultural applications are as important as its consumer use in apparel and in the home . Superimposed on these normal demands was the extensive military requirement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mechanics of production control were straightforward . The WPB made up a list of critical fabrics , and ordered manufacturers who had looms turning out those fabrics before the war to continue turning them out . This was known as the " loom freeze , " which theoretically took care of the supply of cloth , but which did not insure that the cloth would be made up into the things that were most needed . So the WPB gave priority ratings for the cloth to manufacturers who promised to make it up into the critical items . But these priorities had to compete with military ratings which outranked them , and so for a time critical civilian needs were starved at the expense of the military . To meet this problem the WPB set up a system of allocations whereby certain percentages of the frozen looms ' output were set aside for civilian use and certain percentages for military use and for export . THE mechanics of price control were not nearly so straightforward , but the philosophy , as dictated by a wary Congress , was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do no retouching of the industrial picture , no revolutionizing of its normal patterns . Thus the central concept of price control became one of  | freezing prices where they had been before the war . Where it was not practical to put an industry-wide dollar-and-cents ceiling on an item ( as was usually the case ) , OPA either set an industry-wide profit ceiling at the prewar level , or tied the individual 's selling price for the item to his own past ( normal ) selling price , just as restaurant prices for instance ? were tied to those on " our menus for the week of April 4-10 , 1943 . " And the choice among these various methods was made according to which most comfortably fitted normal trade practice . Without the benefit of hindsight , this must have seemed like a fairly logical approach to emergency government control under a capitalist system . Yet it put the administration into this difficult game with two strikes against it : divided command , and the shunning of the profit incentive as an instrument of control . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an individualistic economy , they would affect the other arm 's production plans . And both behaved as if they believed the business man had been hypnotized into living by their incantations instead of by his own profitand-loss sheet . The impact of all this on the cotton textile industry , on the administration 's program , and on the public was as interesting as it was unexpected . Far from keeping industry in a comfortably normal , prewar pose , it sent it spinning in a series of cataclysmic changes which have amounted to little less than a revolution in the production and distribution of cotton textiles . In this lies the principal explanation of why , in spite of the good intentions and zeal of the government planners , the American housewife insisted that the cost of living had gone scandalously high . And , as we shall see , it was these changes which explain why the stores were full of fancy bedspreads , expensive shower curtains , and cotton-stuffed toys , while the consumer searched in vain for sheets , shirts , and inexpensive clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain things in retail stores was that the system of controls had caused a widespread dislocation of the normal channels of distribution , with the result that many retailers were cut off from their former sources of goods . Before the war , the structure of the cotton textile industry was notable for the many hands through which the material passed on its way from the cotton fields to the ultimate consumer . It is helpful to visualize this structure as a series of layers , as follows : 1 . The yarn producer . 2 . The mill , which weaves the yarn into cloth in the gray or unfinished state . This cloth is termed " gray goods . " 3 . The finisher , who bleaches , dyes , prints , or otherwise finishes the gray goods . 4 . The converter , who buys the gray goods from the mill , has them finished by the finisher , and sells the finished cloth . He normally does no manufacturing , but assumes the style and credit risks . Cotton fabrics have a ready and stable market " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain color or printed with a certain design , however , it becomes subject to the shifting preferences of fashion , and the converter who converts staple goods into fashion merchandise normally risks not being able to sell his creations at a profit . 5 . The manufacturer , who makes the finished cloth into garments , or has them made for him by ? 6 . The contractor , who turns out garments under contract without assuming any of the risk for their sale . 7 . The wholesaler or jobber , who buys from manufacturers and sells to the ( smaller ) retailers . 8 . The retailer , who buys from the jobber or ( more usually ) from the manufacturer and sells to the consumer . Before the war , most firms in the cotton textile industry were apt to confine their operations to one of these eight levels . The industry was highly competitive , and it was none too easy to make a consistent profit anywhere in it . And so the average firm felt that it was best to concentrate its efforts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent field in search of greener grass , and come a cropper like any novice in a risky business . Under wartime conditions , however , the risks pretty well disappeared . Anyone  | who had merchandise to sell had no trouble finding a buyer at the ceiling price , and even a novice could make money . Style risk was a thing of the past ; the consumer was in no position to be choosy . With the old deterrents gone , a mill which normally sold gray goods to converters began to wonder why it should not set up its own converting outfit and cop the converter 's profit . Or a manufacturer who used to sell to a host of different jobbers decided it would be a good idea to organize his own jobbing company and run his entire output through it for another profit . This process of one firm 's spanning several functions ( or levels ) in an industry is known as integration , or more familiarly in the trade , " a vertical setup . " The cotton textile industry was not slow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The degree of integration in the cotton textile industry , according to government observers , roughly trebled ? from a prewar twentyfive per cent to a present seventy-five per cent . In the process , the normal channels of distribution went all awry . The independent converters woke up to find that mills who had been their regular sources of supply now did their own finishing and marketed their finished goods themselves . Some of the larger converters were able to save themselves by buying mills , but the smaller ones were left out in the cold . This , in turn , meant that supplies were cut off from the manufacturers who had looked to these smaller converters for their cloth . The larger manufacturers , in the interests of self-preservation , tried to sew up an assured source of supply by buying a mill of their own . Throughout the industry the possession of cloth ( " piece goods " to the trade ) became the passkey to supply . Retailers began to find that the only sure way to get all the merchandise they needed was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers went vertical and bought mills . On the other hand , integration sometimes was brought about by a process almost exactly the reverse of this . Some enterprising mills went so far as to open their own retail piece goods stores , where the consumer was suddenly able to find all manner of scarce fabrics , to the consternation of the department store next door . By a similar process in the hosiery field , hosiery mills took over the hosiery departments in large stores for a nominal rental and operated them as direct retail outlets of the mill . The stores got so much advertising and good will by having stockings to sell that they accepted the arrangement , and everybody was happy ? except the store 's competitors who used to buy from the mill . ( Incidentally , it was this setup which explained why , if you bought stockings at certain department stores , you were billed for them separately from your other purchases . ) If all this sounds confusing , it was even more so to the small business man trying to keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a time of frustration , of pleading , of conniving ? and perhaps , in desperation , of the black market . THE clue to all these industry-shaking changes lies in the price control setup , which looked like this : 1 . At the yarn-producing level , the OPA set dollar-and-cents ceilings on the various types of yarns ; that is , it fixed the maximum price at which each type of yarn could be sold , and that price applied to all sellers . 2 . At the weaving and finishing level , however , the OPA did not put out an industry-wide ceiling price for each type of cloth . Instead , it only limited the margin of profit that the mill or converter could include in its selling price . The various components of their total cost , some of them subject to price ceilings , were added up and multiplied by a markup ( i.e. , profit ) percentage not to exceed that specified in the OPA order for the fabric in question . 3 . At the garment-manufacturing level , the control was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The manufacturer added all his costs and applied a markup limited to his own average historical markup for that price line ? i.e. , his markup for all similar goods which he had sold in the past at or near that price . 4 . Finally , the retailer 's ceiling was the highest price at which he had sold the item in March 1942 ? a so-called " his-  | torical freeze . " If he had not sold it then , his ceiling was supposed to be borrowed from that of a comparable or similar item . Thus there was a different type of control at each level . At the primary or yarn level , the control was simple and tight ? a specified ceiling price for everybody , for each type of yarn . At the fabric level , the only limit specified was the percentage of profit ; the higher a man 's costs , the more this uniform profit rate would net him . At the garment level , even the profit rate was left unspecified and tied only to the manufacturer 's historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the price lines which had the highest profits . And the retailer 's prices for each item were theoretically fixed by a historical freeze , but with a broad loophole on new items provided by the words " similar " and " competitive " in the regulation . The picture was one of progressive relaxation at each level from the yarn producers right on down to the retailers . In justice to the OPA it must be said that it recognized the dollar-and-cents ceiling as the best way to keep a price stable , but felt constrained to avoid outraging established custom in the industry , and therefore applied the dollar-and-cents ceiling only in the yarn field , where the variety of items was small and they were customarily sold at uniform prices throughout the industry . Since in this industry the variety of items and the diversity of their prices normally increase at each successive level , price control , following suit , became looser at each successive level . At any rate , the incentive to go vertical was there . It was a perfectly legitimate way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed for the trebling of the degree of integration . THE ensuing distortion of the channels of distribution and the cutting off of small business from the flow of supply came to a head after V -J Day . During the war , WPB orders had governed virtually the entire production and distribution pattern of cotton textiles . By October 1945 most of the controls had been removed , and in the ensuing free-for-all , small business felt the full impact of increased inte- gration for the first time . There was no simple cure , once the condition had been allowed to go so far . To meet this and other problems ( to be discussed later ) the CPA ultimately had to restore most of the controls that had been prematurely dropped in a burst of optimism when the war was over . The part of this hasty restoration of control that had the closest bearing on the integration problem was the revival of distribution controls , which ordered the mills to set aside specified percentages of their production of key fabrics for certain critical end-uses , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items get the fabric . This did some good , but it by no means solved the problem . In the meantime , the OPA , which had not considered integration its baby because it was not regarded as inflationary , woke up to find that an excessive amount of jobbing had developed in the industry . Mills which used to sell direct were now selling through " affiliated " jobbers ? and pocketing the jobber 's markup . This amounted to adding more middlemen than were normally there . It was inflationary , and no mistake . So OPA put through an amendment that went to the root of the problem by amputating the profit incentive that had caused it . There was henceforth to be no markup for any jobber entering business after September 1 , 1944 , nor for any jobber entering business after May 1 , 1942 , unless he sold the fabric to retailers for over-the-counter sale as piece goods . Finally OPA introduced another amendment on February 26 , 1946 , making the markup for integrated mill converters three per cent less than that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set with a view to producing a desired result in the industry . That which the administration considered bad was made less profitable than that which it considered good . Here at last , after years of attempting to control the economy by fiat , the administration was using the profit motive as the lever by which to exert pressure upon the industry . This recognition of the facts of life was a  | courageous departure from the principle of uniform pricing , and was adopted after much soul-searching , including a survey which showed that independent converters had suffered acutely from declining volume and profits as a result of the vertical revolution in the industry . Thus the vertical gold rush , though primarily not an inflation problem , could not be satisfactorily dealt with by production control alone , because it was the price ( and profit ) structure that had engendered it . And it was not until the OPA adjusted its ceilings to remove the profit incentive toward integration that any effective results were achieved . IV BUT the trend toward integration and the resultant squeeze on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken off was only one of the unforeseen developments . Another was the virtual disappearance of staple , or standard , cotton goods . In normal times the cotton textile industry , like many another , lives off its run of standard or staple items , which though relatively few in number , account for the bulk of its output . Profit margins on this stuff are apt to be narrow , but that fact is outweighed by the large , steady volume and the relative absence of risk . On top of this volume of staple items comes a smaller , heterogeneous flow of specialty , fancy , or " novelty " items on which the profit has to be higher to make up for the smaller volume and the greater risk . Given a strong enough sellers ' market and a price control philosophy based on the historical freeze , the disappearance of staples was inevitable . Let ' em eat cake , if they 'll buy all you make and there 's more money in cake . Moreover , the OPA order which allowed a profit factor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placed a strong premium on over-finishing . As we have seen , mills went in for finishing their own goods . That was not all . Even the mill that did not acquire its own finisher , reluctant to pass up the profit on finishing , arranged to have its gray goods finished on the outside rather than sell them in the gray . The result was that gray goods practically disappeared from the market . This had serious repercussions in some agricultural and industrial fields which used cotton fabrics in the gray state . Bagging , a tremendous and vital end-use of cotton , was confronted with such a shortage of gray goods that the farmer found his feed coming in gaily printed bags . And , as his wife appropriated the empty bags for dressmaking , the re-use of bags was curtailed , further aggravating the situation . Cotton used for industrial belting is weakened and rendered less durable by finishing . Yet finished cottons were all that was available , and that at higher prices . The same was true of cambric for electrical uses . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get as elaborate ( and costly ) as possible . It was not a violation of price ceilings to finish all cotton cloth in colors and checks , rather than in plain white ? and to sell them at the higher prices these finishes brought . But the inevitable result was a serious scarcity of white shirtings , sheets , and other fabrics which had been the mainstays of the industry . Thus the OPA regulation , through a serious flaw in reasoning , backfired , and where it intended to freeze the price structure at a historical level , actually stimulated price rises to the consumer through overfinishing and , through the abandonment of standard fabrics in favor of more expensive fancy fabrics which were less desirable from the consumer 's point of view . The flaw , of course , was that the historical price had been beaten out on an anvil of seller competition and style risk . Its application under conditions of buyer competition and riskless selling meant that the industry would channel its output to where the ceilings were highest ; i.e. , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be accused of attempting to change " trade practice , " but it certainly produced some changes it had not anticipated . By comparison with farmers and industry , consumers are an inert mass , given to suffering in silence . The loudest complaints , after V -J Day , came from agricul- tore and industry . By the first of this year , the situation was serious . Farmers could not get seed-bed covers . The rubber industry could not get fabric for tires , overshoes , and mechanical goods . Automobile manufacturers were held up by a lack of headliners used under car tops . The electric motor industry was stymied without its small but vital requirement of varnished cambric , needed in the gray . The situation called for drastic action and finally got it . OPA cancelled out most of the malignant incentive by eliminating the markup on overfinishing costs ; henceforth the markup , generally speaking , was applied to the gray goods cost plus a limited finishing cost . The CPA , moreover , restored the loom freeze on a list of needed fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sold in the gray . And finally , under the urgency of the situation , CPA and OPA , which were accustomed each to going its own way , got together and adopted a joint program under which , in essence , CPA ordered the needed fabrics made , and OPA provided an incentive price on those fabrics five per cent above the previous ceiling to see that virtue -- in addition to being its own reward ? paid . At last the planners were talking the business man 's language . But more of this incentive program later . V MEANWHILE control had been outmaneuvered in still another way : by widespread resorting to the manufacture of new products and the formation of new businesses . One of the great weaknesses of the historical freeze technique ? the cornerstone of price control ? was the question of what to do about the product that had not been sold in the base period . Had we been willing to standardize on utility models or otherwise limit the variety of items sold , as Great Britain and other countries did , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have " changed trade practice , " and would have destroyed the traditional freedom of the entrepreneur ? a thing we would resort to only if it were absolutely necessary in order to win the war . We elected instead to do things the hard way and keep controls to a minimum . The freedom to shift from one product to another made price control a problem in definitions . Where the item had not been sold in the base period , its ceiling was to be taken from that of a similar item which had been sold , or failing that , from the ceiling of the most closely competitive seller of the same class . The responsibility , as usual , was the seller 's , under the usual threats for non-compliance . However , it is one thing to check a man 's costs for overstatement ; it is quite another to try to police such a metaphysical concept as similarity .  | Thus began the inevitable scramble for the new product with the best possible ceiling . Hence such things as switching from children 's clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sportswear denims , from men 's white shirts to men 's playsuits , from linings to dress fabrics , from light cottons to upholstery fabrics . Along with these changes in product came a great flood of new firms . Apparel salesmen or foremen went into business for themselves and picked their products and their nearest competitor carefully , with an eye to their ceilings . The OPA in New York received some 4,000 applications from new apparel firms in a field where there had been an estimated total of 3,500 firms at the outset of price control . The established firms began to complain that the newcomers were getting far better ceilings than they had . The manufacturer with a ceiling of $12 for his product saw his salesman , after organizing a new company , come up with a ceiling of $20 on just about the same product . With the premium on newness , many established firms went out of business and set up new corporations , to try their luck at better ceilings . OPA , after resisting the notion that this state of affairs could in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the situation by no longer permitting the newcomer to pick his competition . Instead he was assigned to a price-line based on his own experience in the industry . Thus if a man had been a salesman for a $5 dress house he could no longer say his newly organized firm was going to make $15 dresses ; it had to be $5 dresses . This helped considerably in controlling new businesses , but it did not dispose of the problem of shifting products . That problem has , in fact , remained to plague the planners to this day . The newcomer problem was a headache not only in price control but in production control as well . When the CPA restored its priority system after the V-J Day holiday , the applications for priorities in the next quarter ran thirty-five per cent from new manufacturers . What is more , of these newcomers , sixty per cent purported to be veterans . The CPA suspected that at least some of these were dummy corporations set up by established businesses in an attempt to corral a larger share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid down the law that there was to be no discrimination against new enterprises , and this meant that , unless something were done , CPA had many more mouths to feed with the already inadequate supply . Something was done . The first step was to require that newcomers applying for ratings must show evidence that they had price ceilings authorized by OPA for the finished garments . That struck gold . Applications slowed down to a walk . Apparently many of the newcomers had had no intention of manufacturing garments , but were simply using the setup as a means of getting valuable piece goods which they proposed to sell to the highest bidder . It was then found that most of the newcomers who did use the piece goods were having contractors do their manufacturing for them . What had happened was that in the first quarter of 1946 there was almost a third less yardage of fabrics available for apparel than there had been in 1943 . This meant curtailed volume for apparel manufacturers generally , but for the smaller contract shops it was catastrophic , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwindling supplies of piece goods out of their reach . The CPA had reason to believe that many of the contractors were using veteran fronts to help get them piece goods . The CPA by this time was prepared to get tough with any backing and filling in the industry that might interfere with the program . The order was consequently amended so that any newcomer , to qualify for priority ratings , had to own or lease the manufacturing facilities and meet the payroll on the labor used to manufacture the apparel . Moreover , facilities which operated as contractors for the account of others were not eligible . This last was intended to stop the big retailers from getting more than their share of the supply by using contract shops to make up garments from piece goods they had acquired in a vertical setup . Wheels within wheels . And finally , CPA decided to consider applications from newcomers only if their annual sales volume was to be less than $250,000 . The big newcomer was out . These regulations did not add up to a very hearty welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen its allocations to established businesses cut thirty per cent . So now the newcomer , unless he was small and virtuous , had the door slammed in his face . VI PERHAPS the most serious of the unplanned problem-children of control in the cotton textile industry , at least from the standpoint of inflation , was the disappearance of low priced goods ( or " low-end merchandise , " as it is termed by the trade ) . For the housewife living on a budget , the Government statistics ? delicately recording ever-so-fractional rises in the general level of retail prices-were a hollow mockery . They weighed baskets of kittens with the kittens jumping out . As far as she was concerned , if she had always paid $1.95 for her husband 's shirts and now the cheapest shirt she could buy cost $3.50 , the cost of keeping a shirt on her husband 's back had gone up seventy-five per cent . And the same was true of a great many of the things average-income people buy . The best-selling price for cotton housedresses before the war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mid-1946 were $2.98 . The statistician comparing a $2.98 cotton dress in 1946 with a $2.98 cotton dress in 1940 might see no price rise ( the drop in quality was distressing , but not a statistical concept ) ; yet the increase in the cost  | of cotton dresses to the customer was as plain as a pikestaff and just as sharp , The reasons for this insidious but widespread type of inflation are by now pretty obvious and need not be labored . The government would not or could not freeze the production as well as the price of the low cost item . The wartime " utility " product was all right for England , but not for the world 's richest country . So we tried to freeze prices and left the producer free to pick his product , with profit as his guide . At each level in the industry the profit pressure was upward , toward the higher price-lines . The incentive to overfinished and more expensive fabrics has already been described . At the apparel level , the OPA order had a built-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive items , since it was only the profit margin that was frozen . The manufacturer could sell all he could make , so he was a dolt not to concentrate on his highest price-lines , which would give him the largest dollar sales per unit of production , and on top of that usually a higher profit margin , because the higher priced items historically carried the higher markups . Finally , at the retail level , stores would any day rather sell two $50 dresses than ten $10 ones ? especially as the alternative more likely was ten $50 dresses or ten $10 ones . The only curb on the retailer 's natural urge to " trade up " was the rule that he might not introduce a price-line higher than he had sold in the base period . But so long as he stocked one $50 dress in March 1942 , he had the right of way . And even that mild curb was removed in 1944 by an amendment fathered by Congressman Hartley of New Jersey , a then vocal critic of the professors in the OPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the problem was , to borrow a term from the diplomats , nonrecognition . By the beginning of 1945 the problem could no longer be ignored , however . In February of that year the WPB announced a " low-end program . " Sellers of fabrics were required to set aside a stated portion of their annual sales for manufacturers of low-priced garments on the essential list . Garment manufacturers in turn were assigned priority ratings for these fabrics related to their peacetime output of similar items . In June the OPA followed up with its Maximum Average Price ( MAP ) order designed to check " trading up " by limiting the garment manufacturer 's average price per unit currently sold to his average price in 1943 . That one hurt a bit . It meant that if the manufacturer sold more high-priced goods than in 1943 , he now had to sell more low-priced goods to offset this and come out with the average unit price he had had in 1943 . The next step was OPA 's pre-ticketing order , which attempted to place dollarand-cents ceilings at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affix a retail price ticket to each garment , showing the retail ceiling based on OPA schedules . In spite of all these well meant measures , the dent made in the low-end problem was disappointingly small , as evidenced by the fact that when production controls generally came off after V-J Day , they still had to be retained for this program . The priority ratings were assigned and the fabrics were supposed to be beautifully " channeled , " but somehow the lowpriced merchandise still did not appear in the stores . Once again a profit incentive was needed to deal with the situation . It came in March 1946 , when the CPA and OPA jointly announced an " incentive program , " the feature of which was a five per cent rise in the ceiling price of the critical low-end items , as well as other items whose production it was desired to encourage . The response was immediate ; at last government and industry understood each other . The low-end problem was too stubborn to lick overnight , but it was apparent then that the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in increasing volume . VII THESE , then , were some of the major skirmishes on the battlefield of a government-controlled industry . Their recital tells a lot about the real reasons for the stubborn shortages in many kinds of consumer goods , and helps explain the wor- ried , uneasy state of mind of consumers and business men alike these days . Recriminations against both sides in the government-industry tussle have been plentiful , and there is no need to add to them here . The only excuse for this postmortem is the moral that emerges from it . The story of control in the cotton textile industry points up two important conclusions about central control in a capitalist society : 1 . Control is indivisible . The combined operation must have a unified command . Price control and production control are interlocked . 2 . In our profit economy , the chief lever of control must be profits . The only effective way to make industry produce certain items and behave in required ways is to make such production and such behavior more profitable than others . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that threatened a breakdown of control in the industry , it was not until both OPA and CPA acted together that results began to be achieved . Co-ordination of price control with production control from the start would have been a good investment for the industry as well as for the country as a whole . And it is a tribute to Fred M. Vinson that he recognized this when he issued the so-called Vinson Directive late in 1943 . This directive established the principle that it is unfair ( a better word would have been useless ) for the administration to force a man to do something if price is a deterrent , and commanded the OPA and WPB to work together whenever necessary ( ! ) , the OPA adjusting the price if WPB declared it was a deterrent . The right hand must know , and must support , , what the left hand is doing . Also we have seen that the underlying cause of each of the unforeseen and unwanted consequences of control was the existing pattern of profit incentives in the industry . So long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desired results , they simply challenged the considerable ingenuity of the industry into maneuvering to evade the plan . Much of this evasion , as shown above , was entirely legal . But an untold amount of it inevitably took the form of subterfuges and black marketeering . For the inescapable fact is that no amount of policing can overcome the gravitational pull of profits in the American economy . WHETHER or not the planned economy is a good or an evil thing is not the subject of this inquiry . The fact is that we have had to resort to it in the past , and we may have to resort to it again in some future emergency . The vital thing for Americans is to make certain that , if and when that happens , it shall not , by its breakdown , bring on the end of what we value in our economic system . Our system has the virility and flexibility to stand central planning at such times as the people deem it necessary , in the areas where they want it . But if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit the planning to it , by making profits the instrument of control . While this conclusion seems to emerge logically enough from our recent experience , its implications are fairly startling . It would mean that the business man would have his profit determined , not by the pre-emergency level ( an act of God ) , - but by the Administration 's judgment as to the need for his product ( an act of a bureaucrat ) . Such a program would doubtless have slim chances of approval by our present Congress . One can imagine its stormy reception by business , and the outcry that it is un-American , dictatorial , socialistic , and what not . For while OPA and CPA have , in the end , used profit incentives to achieve objectives , it has been done haltingly , on a few items , and has involved the raising ? never the lowering ? of profits on those items . There is no general recognition , even by them , that they have been tampering with profits ; all they have done is raise a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to . Yet , whatever the objections , and whatever the admitted difficulties of administration , central control under a profit system must be through profits , if it is to work . This is the only practical way ; any other sets off the kind of tug of war already described . And , far from being revolutionary , this approach to the planned economy is the only one that would safeguard the profit motive , and through it our economic system .  |
