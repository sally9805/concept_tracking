Both of the Washingtons were still growing last week-the Capital of politics , of lobbyists , bureaucracy , waste , inefficiency , greed , red tape , delay , confusion ; and the other Washington , the center of a Government that is the world 's biggest business , where decisions somehow get made and work somehow gets done . <P> War has sharpened the cleavage between the two capitals . The city and its confusion are endlessly multiplied : to faraway citizens , Washington looks and sounds like a madhouse . But the solid core has grown too : Washington now has more keen managerial talent than any other city in the world . <P> Some of the best men in Washington are naturally the men in the biggest jobs , the headline names . There are also scores - and perhaps hundreds-of capable 60-hour-a-week executives who never get their names in the papers . At the top rank of these good executives and just below the big headliners are the little headliners . They are a few dozen men of key importance who have already qualified for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ten of them , chosen not necessarily as the best ten but as typical of efficient patriots : <P> James V. Forrestal , 50 , went to Washington after making a pile of money in Wall Street , where he was president of the investment banking firm of Dillon , Read &; Co . He still wears his banker 's semi-stiff collars , smokes a pipe , has an amiably smashed nose from boxing . A man of healthy cynicism , Forrestal sometimes says : " I doubt very seriously that I 'm doing any good down here . I do n't know whether businessmen should go into the government or not . " But as Under Secretary of the Navy , Jim Forrestal reorganized the archaic Navy purchasing system , is now responsible for all of its huge procurement program . By making his job one of Washington 's best-managed , he has earned the town 's respect . <P> Robert Porter Patterson , 51 , a blunt , monkish onetime Federal Appeals Court judge , was doing K.P . duty in the Army reserve camp at Plattsburg the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington he got an equally messy job : channeling the Army 's swollen , muddied procurement program . He went to work in shirt sleeves , vest dangling , jaws chomping gum , his right arm working like a pump handle as he announced decisions . Soon he was promoted to Under Secretary . Judicial Bob Patterson 's plodding , plugging methods have led him down many a blind alley . But they have also knocked over blank walls . He won permission for field ordnance officers to award orders up to $500.000 without approval from Washington , finally got the figure to $5,000,000 , now has cut by two-thirds the time it took the Army to sign contracts . He was pounding his desk over Army waste of strategic materials long before most men in Washington even knew this was a problem .
