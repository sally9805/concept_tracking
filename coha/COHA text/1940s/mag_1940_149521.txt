Last week , while screaming bombs were falling on London , C. Martin Wilbur , curator of Chinese archeology &; ethnology at Chicago 's Field Museum of Natural History , called attention to his exhibit of Chinese whistling arrows . They were used by Manchu bodyguards to frighten people off the streets when the emperor rode by . The large , blunt whistle head kept them from being dangerous . <P> Probably the earliest reference to whistling arrows credits their use to a Hsiung Nu , Mongolian prince , Maotun ( 200 B.C. ) , who used them to train his followers to loyalty . Whenever he shot his screamer at something , attendants were to follow up , shoot to kill . Those who hesitated were executed . Methodically working up from his favorite horse to his favorite concubine , he finally aimed his plaything at his father , went on to found the powerful Hsiung Nu dynasty .
