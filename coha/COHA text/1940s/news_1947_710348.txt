txt Mayor O'Dwyer embarked upon a broad program of consolidation of city departments 9 , nd full mechanization of city services yesterday when he asked the Citizens Budget Commission to work with city officials on large-scale ' surveys in both fields . On the principle that departments should be grouped according to function , the Mayor suggested a possible merger of the Police , Fire and Correction Departments into one agency . Similarly , he asked the Budget Commission to explore the possibility of combining the Sanitation Department with the Department of Public Works , since the haulage of material forms a large part of the work of both departments . In both suggested mergers , the Mayor said close attention should be given to the substitution of mechanized equipment for manpower wherever possible . While no jobs are to be abolished under the plan , the Mayor ' believes he can finance new motorized equipment in part with the money he saves by failing to fill ' city jobs . The city payroll now lists 185,000 employes . In addition to their salaries , the city must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . So far as the city 's manpower is concerned , the Mayor believes in an adequate , welt-paid staff for essential functions . However , he considers that the substitution of machinery for hand labor will produce more efficient work at an eventual saving . The Mayor 's idea will require study , which will make it too late for incorporation in the 1947-48 budget . but it may provide the groundwork for substantial revision of city services in the 1948-49 budget The Sanitation Department , which ranks with Police and Fire among the " expensive " city departments , has bought little new equipment since 1938 , and much of its work is done by individual laborers . Instead of having ash and garbage trucks choking the streets during the day , the Mayor believes the streets can be cleaned at night by machinery .

By using standardized equipment as much as possible and maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city could centralize its maintenance and repair services on motor vehicles at a huge saving . W ? nts Replacement System Borrowing from Army and Navy practice , the Mayor wants to set up a unit replacement system whereby a defective engine would be completely replaced , or a defective transmission could be similarly handled . With about 25 per cent of the Sanitation Department vehicles in repair shops now , this system could cut down time in the shop and increase a vehicle 's working time . At present many city departments maintain their own shops for their own vehicles , at considerable duplication of facilities and effort . By using smaller and lighter vehicles specifically adapted to the tasks they must handle , the Mayor believes many three and four story firehouses could be replaced by smaller structures . He has suggested that savings might be made by using Diesel-powered heavy equipment instead of gasolinepowered vehicles . He would like to see more two-way radio vehicles engaged in the protection of life and property , serving both police and fire purposes . While his ideas are still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of increasing the patrol force on the streets up to 23,000 by using up , to 8,000 firemen on radio patrol . While it might take time to work out , he believes recruits for each department could be trained in the functions of the other . $2,564,000 Added to Budget At an executive session yesterday , the Board of Estimate voted to add $2,564,000 to the Mayor 's executive budget of $1,029,120,314 , making the total $1,031,774,314 . Private hospitals caring for city patients would get fee increases amounting to $1,414,000 , or an in crease from $4.50 to $6 a day . The , board also voted $500,000 for the daytime care of children in childcare centers after the Mayor said the State had agreed to supplement the city appropriation . The board also provided an additional $400,000 for child-caring institutions , and an additional $250 , - 000 for school supplies . Libraries received no additional amounts and the Mayor said the city had gone as far as it could on libraries in this budget .

' Approval of the Mayor 's request ' for the surveys he has asked was voted yesterday by the executive committee of the Citizens Budget Commission at its offices , 51 East Forty-second Street . Harold Riegelman , counsel , was named as chairman of the survey committee , with former Commissioner of Housing and Buildings Aired Rheinstein and George Van Namee , former chairman of the Public Service ' Commission , as his assistants .
