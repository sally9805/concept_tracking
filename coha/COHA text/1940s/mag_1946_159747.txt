The State Department reluctantly laid down a policy last week for U.S. airlines operating in ex-enemy nations . The policy , over which State has hemmed &; hawed for weeks , was forced out by the squabble between Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc. and the British Government . Nub of the dispute : control of Italy 's internal airlines . <P> Last winter T.W.A. signed a contract with the Italian Government under which a new company , Linee Aeree-Italiane Societ Perazioni was to get an exclusive franchise to fly internal air routes : T.W.A. was to get a 40% interest in L.A.I . The British demanded that T.W.A. share its interest with the Government-owned British Overseas Airways Corp . T.W.A. President Jack Frye refused , saying that British and American equipment could not be profitably operated together . <P> Confident that T.W.A. could out-compete B.O.A.C. , Frye proposed that the British set up a competing line . But the British , not as anxious to compete as to share , used diplomatic pressure to prevent the Italian Government from carrying out its contract with T.W.A. <P> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of Russia 's air monopoly in the Balkans , told T.W.A. : the U.S. is opposed to exclusive trade privileges for any one power in ex-enemy states . But if the exclusive features were taken out of the T.W.A. contract , the Department would try to see that the contract was carried out . Said State to the British : the U.S. could not force T.W.A. to share its Italian interests with B.O.A.C. However , the British could arrange with the Italian Government to form a rival company . <P> T.W.A. 's Frye quickly dropped the exclusive air privileges , thought it was a clear victory for T.W.A. It would be-if the Italian Cabinet passes a decree giving the contract final approval this week .
