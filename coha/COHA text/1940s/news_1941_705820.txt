txt So far the government has done more to raise food prices than to steady them . Upshot is that , if the government turned today to a policy of holding food prices down , it still would have to allow another increase in retail prices as large as the one which has taken place since the war began . Assuming that the pending price control bill with its ceiling on farm prices at 110% of " parity " went into effect today , the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that retail food prices . nevertheless , would rise another 12% . Other agencies place the estimate as high as 25% . Reason is that the administration , at the behest of the farm bloc in and out of Congress , has thus far been following a policy of " supporting "  - -  really raising  --  the prices at which foodstuffs sell on the farm and in wholesale markets . Retail prices have yet to reflect fully the effect of this " support .

Higher living coats , higher wages , higher production costs ? its the old cycle . Farm , Wholesale Prices The government has been encouraging a rise in the farm and wholesale prices of foods in at least three ways . It has been buying food and shipping it out of the country , thus increasing demand . It has pegged the price of nine food products at relatively high levels by announcing that it will buy all of them offered . It jacked up wheat and corn prices by the policy , forced on the Administration by the farm bloc , of accepting these crops as collateral for loans at prices equal to 85% of " parity . " ( " Parity " prices are prices for farm crops which will give the farmer the same ability to buy things he uses as he had in 1909-14 . ) Of special importance in raising food prices has been the lease-lend program , creating a special kind of export demand . Although lease-lending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 5% of the nation 's total food consumption , the surplus marketing administration ( which buys for lease-lend and domestic relief ) has been buying 70 different kinds of food at the sizable clip of about $2 million daily . A total of $200 million has been spent since April . However , many of these purchases have been of commodities , like dairy products , tomatoes and eggs , in which the supply-demand situation already was tight  --  and prices were correspondingly sensitive  --  because of the boominspired domestic demands . What 's been Bought Purchases of foods made by the Surplus Marketing Administration have included over 205 million pounds of pork products , 175 million pounds of lard , 55 million pounds of cheese , 4 million cases of tomatoes , 9 million pounds of soybeans. 9 million pounds of vitamin concentrates , 1 million cases of grapefruit , 2,500. - 000 bushels of corn , and 64 million pounds of dried and frozen egg products . Purchasing officials say they would buy considerably more than $2 million worth of food daily if ships were available to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the SIIA. buys , wants food . Food gets shipping apace ahead of tanks and guns . Meanwhile , to encourage production by guaranteeing prices , the government put a floor under the prices for nine foodstuffs by offering to buy any quantities offered at lower quotations . Now the open market prices for all these commodities are above the floors , or pegs . So the government , instead of buying in the open market like other consumers , arranges its purchases through private negotiations with suppliers , receiving  --  or so officials claim  --  prices below the market . Other consumers are n't so lucky . Have n't Reserves Secretary of Agriculture Wickard tempered his price-pegging announcement with the warn . Mg that the government also would sell these nine commodities to depress prices which were too high . The threat was an empty one .

In some cases , the commitment to continue these minimum prices covers only the 1941 crop ; others are to be supported until June 30 , quorem . Acted Openly on 7 Foods Meanwhile , the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply has acted openly on only seven foods . Three of them are import commodities not domestically produced . Only one of them has a price ceiling so far . OPACS did place a price ceiling of 3.50 cents per pound , wholesale , on raw sugar .

The government 's new policy of price stabilization still is n't husky enough to tip the scales against the New Deal 's eight-year-old policy of aiding the farmer .
