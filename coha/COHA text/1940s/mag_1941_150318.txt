Last week London lost the last traces of a sentimental old symbol-the Crystal Palace . A Victorian monster of iron and glass , surrounded by gardens full of melancholy statuary , the Palace had been since 1854 London 's high-toned version of Coney Island . Thousands of contemporary Londoners had their first childhood outings there , listening to holy choirs , brass bands , evangelists ; watching cricket , soccer , motorbike races ; running through the gardens , boating on the pond . In World War I the grounds and building incongruously became H.M.S. Crystal Palace-i.e. a " training ship " for naval reservists . <P> In November 1936 most of the building , including one of the ugly twin towers , burned to the ground . But the North Tower remained . Recently the neighborhood began to think the Luftwaffe was using the tower as a landmark . The Supply Ministry also wanted its 840 tons of wrought and cast iron . So , one day last week , engineers packed 120 Ib. of gelignite against one side of the tower , touched it off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later that evening , which was bonny , clear-skied , and warm enough to discard topcoats , Hyde Park was lively with strollers and the Serpentine with boats , and a vendor at Marble Arch was briskly selling red rubber balls painted with the faces of Hitler and Mussolini . In Leicester Square crowds jammed the first anniversary showing of Gone With the Wind and the first week of Shaw 's Major Barbara . On the radio , Sir Adrian Boult was conducting a memorial concert to Sir Hamilton Harty . Two hundred Harrod 's employes carried home gas masks , after a gas test in the store . Freckled brown orchids sold at a half crown a bunch in Piccadilly , where the crowds window-shopped before late dinners or after big late teas in crowded Lyons ' Corner Houses . Londoners were not liking the news from Libya and Greece , but were relaxing in the comfortable conviction that the war was receding from their doorstep . <P> When the alarm came , no one took it particularly seriously . Just another nuisance raid , most people thought . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop for a long time . A few fire bombs began falling . People drove to watch fires for a lark . <P> Then the flares began to float down-long graceful chain flares , star flares , flaming onions , and Molotov chandeliers , which ripple down in long ribbons of fire . From all directions the planes began to dive-bomb , lower than usual , and more than usual . This , the citizenry suddenly realized , was a return visit for the big fire raid the R.A.F. had bestowed on Berlin 's Unter den Linden the week before ; this would be bad .
