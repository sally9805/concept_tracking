txt The State Department announced today that President Truman would submit the military assistance program for Western Europe to Congress soon and would recommend a six-point program designed to assist the members of the North Atlantic pact and other free nations in rebuilding their defenses . At present the defenses of Western Europe , the department emphasized , were so " inadequate " as to " invite military aggression . " The cost of the program for the first year , the fiscal year 1950 , was placed at $1,450,000,000 , of which $1,130,000,000 would be for the North Atlantic pact countries and the rest , about $320,000,000 , for Greece , Turkey and " certain " other nations , whose security is important to the United States . These nations presumably include Iran . But the department envisaged programs in subsequent years , ex plaining that the one for the fiscal year which ends on June 30 , 1950 , would be an interim one , covering most urgently needed military aid requirements . It described the program in a pamphlet entitled " Building the Peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , the department said : " We can not count on our friends in Western Europe to resist if our strategy in the event of war is to abandon these friends to the enemy with a promise of later liberation . Western Europe must count on us if it is to survive , and we , in turn , must count on Western Europe if we are to endure . " It listed the six-point recommendations that are to be presented to Congress saying they would provide that : 1 . " All projects of United States military aid be brought together in one program . " 2 . " A single appropriation be made to cover the costs of the entire military aid program . " $1,450,000,000 for Western Europe , Greece , Turkey and certain other nations. 3 . " The Chief Executive be given the authority to make flexible use of these funds and to meet emergencies as they arise . " Technical Aid Proposed 4 . " Most of our aid at this time go to Western Europe , an area whose importance to our security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The military aid program be separate and distinct from the North Atlantic Treaty , but that it complement that treaty through carrying out the principles of self-help and mutual aid . " 6 . " Our military aid to the free nations of Western Europe in 1950 take three , forms : a relatively small but very important amount of dollar aid to increase military production programs of ' the Western European nations and thus speed termination of their present heavy dependence on the United States , a direct supply of arms and equipment to help accelerate the strengthening of the defensive capabilities of their military forces , and the provision of United States technical and training assistance . " The program for subsequent years , the department said , " will be dependent upon many intangibles . " There would also be certain " limiting factors . " " The first of these factors , " it said in this connection , " is that each year 's program will add a permanent increment in defensive strength . With the exception of the aid to Greece , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , capital equipment , equipment which lasts in peactime for many years . " A second factor is that the aid projected for Western Europe is being furnished to military forces which are of definite size and composition . " A third limiting factor will be the increasing ability of the nations of Western Europe to provide for themselves . " The fourth and greatest factor is the degree to which we and the nations associated with us can remove the threat of war . " The department outlined the program as something that was " conceived and developed separately and somewhat in advance of the formulation " of the North Atlantic pact . However , they were described as based upon the same principles and as complementary . " The military assistance program , " it said , " would be necessary even without an Atlantic pact . It is clear , however , that the military assistance program will be more effective with the Atlantic pact than without it . "                @ @ @ @ @
