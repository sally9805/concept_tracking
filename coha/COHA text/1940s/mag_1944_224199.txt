Kneeling thousands stared hard at two phials on the high altar in Naples ' gothic Cathedral . The phials , people had been taught , contained dried blood of St. Januarius , patron saint of the city who died a martyr in the time of Diocletian ( 245-313 ) . Last Saturday the hard , dark substance was due to turn to liquid , as it does the first Saturday of every May and every Sept. 19 if the outlook for Naples is good . <P> Throughout the long , tense afternoon the hymns and orisons followed one another in unbroken march . The tired voice of Cardinal Ascalesi led the prayers . But no miracle occurred . At half past nine the Cardinal announced that because of army curfew regulations the vigil would have to be postponed . Departing , the people wept . <P> Sunday at half past two the bells rang out . Pious Neapolitans , flocking to learn the cause , were elated to hear that the miracle of the liquefaction had finally taken place , 22 hours after the first prayer .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
