WHITTLING BOY-Roger Burlingame - Harcourt , Brace ( $3 ) . <P> Concerning Eli Whitney , scholars have ginned from history only a few pale fluffs of information . Roger Burlingame , social-minded historian of U. S. invention ( Engines of Democracy , etc. ) , has woven these factual fluffs , plus a few skeins of imaginative ersatz , into an attractive fabric which is part novel , part biography : Whittling Boy-the Story of Eli Whitney . <P> Young Eli Whitney developed his mechanical skill in the rustic smithies which forged muskets for General Washington 's troops . But when peace came , folk expected their new Confederation to become a great nation through the inventions of lawyers , not of tinkerers . So , despite his gift for whittling and smithing , Eli went to Yale College where he studied mathematics , then to Georgia to teach school and study law . He lived on the plantation of General Nathanael Greene 's charming widow . She urged her whittling friend to devise a machine for cleaning cotton . Author Burlingame thinks that any Yankee tinkerer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seedy bolls , could have invented the cotton gin . <P> But Whitney 's genius was far more distinguished . He returned to New Haven , struggled desperately against widespread infringement of his patents ( and against his own desire for marriage ) . To produce cotton gins of uniform quality in large numbers he was slowly working out the division of labor , the principle of interchangeable parts which underlie industrial mass production . <P> In 1798 the young republic , fearing a warlord of continental Europe , undertook its first full-fledged defense program . From the Federal Government in Philadelphia Whitney got a contract for 10,000 muskets . But New Haven whispered of the queer doings at the new arms factory : Whitney was n't building muskets at all , he was building machines . When delivery was called for , Whitney could show only 500 muskets and a weird machine shop . <P> In muddy Washington there was disappointment , doubt , ill will over his failure . So Whitney went to the White House with a boxful of ten gunstocks , ten barrels , ten triggers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thomas Jefferson , other awed officials choose at random the parts from which a single excellent musket was quickly assembled . It was an unprecedented event in military and industrial history . The Government leniently extended Whitney 's contract . His machine shop hummed on .
