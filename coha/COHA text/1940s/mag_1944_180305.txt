OPA felt that at last it was about to give the nation 's grocers and housewives something really &; truly simple . Date of the gift is Feb. 27 , but last week , well in advance , OPA was proudly explaining about its new change-making food tokens . The fiber tokens ( see cut ) will be red for meats and fats , blue for processed foods . Each token will be worth one ration point . All red and blue food stamps will be worth ten points , no matter what the figures already printed on them . Stamps will remain valid for twelve weeks instead of the current four . Use of the tokens will mean no more brown stamps . <P> OPA 's Food Rationer Walter Straub figures that the tokens will save shopkeepers an annual $35 million worth of time otherwise spent sorting stamps . The American taxpayer , he judges , will save $1.5 million every time a new ration book is not issued .                  @ @ @
