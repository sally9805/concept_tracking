It was the biggest &; best collection of borrowed art since the loot Napoleon had brought home to the Louvre from his conquering sweep of Europe . And it was even better guarded . In Washington 's National Gallery , blue-coated guards in reinforced numbers paced the corridors . Military policemen stood in every room . But the 202 paintings they were guarding ( estimated value : $80,000,000 ) were not loot , though they too had been brought back by conquerors ( TIME , Feb. 11 , 1946 ) . All but two-a Daumier and a Manet-had once hung on the walls of Berlin 's Kaiser Friedrich Museum . <P> Last week , the conquerors were making the most of this loot-on-loan . One day the attendance at the National Gallery was 11,895 . Lecturers took whole platoons of sightseers through , speaking in sibilant whispers , and on the rim of every cluster gallerygoers jostled to see &; hear . But no one could take in everything-the 15 Rembrandts , six Rubens , five Botticellis , the Bruegels , Vermeers , three Raphaels , five Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holbeins , Diirers , Hals and the Velasquez . <P> An American lieutenant colonel had stumbled on the treasure , 2,000 feet underground in a German salt mine . After being on show for a month in Washington , the 202 paintings will be returned to Germany-but not to Berlin , for fear that the Russians might grab them , as they grabbed the treasures of the Zwinger in Dresden . Instead , they will probably go to Wiesbaden and Munich , in the U.S. zone .
