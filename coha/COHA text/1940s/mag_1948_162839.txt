Elsie Frankfurt , who had studied designing at Southern Methodist University , was distressed by the unesthetic appearance of her married sister Edna . She was pregnant . Said Elsie : " You look simply horrible . We 've go to do something . " <P> Setting her designer 's mind to work , Elsie soon had a dress that made Edna look both slender and stylish . A clamor for copies convinced Elsie and Edna that they should go into business . They pooled $500 , hired three seamstresses and rented a small shop in a strategic location-the Medical Arts Building , where most Dallas obstetricians have offices . Thus , ten years ago , began a business that has grown until it is now a U.S. merchandising sensation : Page Boy maternity clothes . <P> Now there are 100 employees and four Page Boy-owned stores ( in Dallas , Los Angeles , Indianapolis and San Francisco ) , plus 250 other retail outlets . Last year the Page Boy grossed $1,026,584 , on which the sister-partners netted better than 10% . This week , with profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new Dallas building which will enable them to boost production 50% . <P> The business is run with gay informality . Elsie , still single , is " administrative director " ( " It took me an hour , " she says , " to think up that title " ) . She does a little of everything , including shopping over long-distance telephone . Sample : " Jack , this is Elsie . Elsie-who else calls you from Dallas ? Get me some colors , I 've got to have colors . Need gabardine , about 10,000 yards . Have n't a yard of brown left . Okay ? Now do n't forget . " <P> Edna , the cause of it all , is " in charge of production and merchandising . " A third sister , Louise ( " Tootsie " ) , who joined the team after finishing college , in 1941 , now does all the designing . Last week the sisters had a new number they thought exciting : a Page Boy convertible . A few simple alterations transform it into a stylish post-maternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect model for it .
