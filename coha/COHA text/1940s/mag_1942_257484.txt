It was a black week for the U.S. female leg . Du Pont announced tersely that , " because of demand for military purposes , " nylon would no longer be sold on contract but on a spot basis ( i.e. , if there was any to sell ) . That meant that hosiery makers would get no nylon . They had long since stopped getting silk . <P> On what silk the U.S. has left WPB tightened its grip last week , even at the Army 's expense . After March 1 " no silk may be used in the manufacture of parachutes until the grade and type has been approved by the Defense Supplies Corp . " Evidently the Army had been wastefully using it on parachute shroud lines and cords instead of saving it for canopies . If nylon is subjected to similar husbanding , women can at least feel that their sacrifice is necessary . <P> What will they wear instead ? Of the 43,000,000 pairs of women 's full-fashioned hosiery shipped last year , 7,000,000 were all nylon , 22,000,000 were all silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk or nylon from the knee down . Fortnight ago , WPB ordered the rayon industry to increase the percentage of its output earmarked for hosiery . But the increase ( from 9 to 12% of the viscose and cuprammonium output and from 5 to 6% of acetate ) was not enough to make up the difference in quantity , even if women liked rayon stockings , which they do n't . <P> Despite longtime experiments by the U.S. Department of Agriculture , hosiery stylists never cottoned to cotton either . No modern stocking machine exists that can make acceptable full-fashioned cotton hosiery except from long-staple cotton , which grows only in small quantities in the U.S. <P> Moreover , long-staple imports , chiefly from Egypt , * are not to be depended on . And if U.S. production of long-staple cotton booms ( the Government is now encouraging it with special subsidies ) , U.S. spindles to spin it are limited , even on a three-shift basis , to a maximum of 4,000,000 Ib. a year . If all of that were spun into the best hosiery yarn , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. women 's hosiery market . Furthermore , long-staple cotton has important defense uses , such as powder bags , balloons . Upshot : many a girl who used to take pride in her legs will wear either seamless ( i.e. , shapeless ) cotton stockings made from coarser , short-staple cotton , or knee-length " campus hose , " or nothing . <P> <P> * Last week W. R. Grace &; Co. ' s Cecil Kern began a campaign to lower the U.S. duty , kill the quota regulations on Peru 's long-staple cotton . These limitations ( dear to U.S. cotton Congressmen ) normally keep U.S. imports to only 4,000 bales out of Peru 's total crop of over 300,000 bales .
