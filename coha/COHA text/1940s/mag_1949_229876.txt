TO BE A PILGRIM ( 343 pp. ) - Joyce Cary-Harper ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Tom Wilcher was one of those choice eccentrics who , if English novelists are to be believed , still wander about the English countryside . He was a tough-minded conservative . He believed in God . He despised what seemed to him the shilly-shallowness of the between-wars younger generation and stoutly affirmed that the days of his youth , well before World War I , were the best a man could be born to . <P> When his niece Ann , a painfully plain woman doctor , bundled him off to the family 's abandoned country house , old Tom feared that it was not so much out of affection for him as out of an interest in how he 'd leave his money . But he settled down to enjoy the countryside he had known as a young fellow , and to watch with a critical eye the love affair and marriage of Ann and his nephew Robert . <P> Gaiety v. Wit . There is no earth-shaking action in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses to tell in To Be a Pilgrim ( the fourth of his novels to be published in the U.S. ) , but Author Cary manages to convey one man 's view of what has been happening to English life since Tom Wilcher 's Victorian youth . <P> The love affair of Ann and Robert had mighty little spirit and even less romance old Tom Wilcher thought . After they were married , Robert returned to the fields phlegmatically modernizing the farm , and Ann calmly took up her chores , all as romantic as a baked potato . And naturally they drifted apart . <P> Tom let his mind spin back to livelier days . He remembered his devilish sister Lucy , who willfully eloped with Puggy Brown , the butcher ; Lucy had scrubbed floors , suffered humiliation and yet found happiness in Puggy 's gypsy crusade as leader of a revivalist sect . He remembered his own brilliant brother Edward , who rose to power as a Liberal politician and later came to a colorful , if disappointing , end . These people had made mistakes , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been of the real England " whose nature was rather affection than passion ; whose gaiety was rather humor than wit ; whose judgment did not spring from logic but from sense . " <P> Chaucer v. Black Hats . In a London hotel , watching the faces of those about him , Tom thinks : " When Chaucer wrote of pilgrimage . . . then every man knew where he was , and where he could go . But now all is confusion and no one has anywhere to go . They leave home only to sit under glass roofs , in black overcoats and black hats , with faces so private and cunning that you are afraid of them . " <P> While not so lively or lightly spun as its predecessor , Herself Surprised ( TIME , Sept. 20 ) , To Be a Pilgrim has a vibrant life . Together , the two novels form part of a first-rate trilogy covering 20th-century English manners &; morals in a half-serious , half-picaresque vein ; the last and best of the three , The Horse 's Mouth , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
