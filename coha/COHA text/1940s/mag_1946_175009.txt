Soon after the trains stopped running last week , President Truman went to a White House garden party , sipped some lemonade and calmly ate a dish of ice cream . It was a party for disabled war veterans , arranged several weeks before . Harry Truman shook hands with some 900 wounded men , many of them in wheel chairs . One disabled man asked the President how the railroad strike was going . Said Harry Truman : it was still on . <P> He knew at that moment what he was going to do about the strike and about the threat of a resumed coal strike . For weeks he had done everything he had believed it was possible to do , short of getting sore , tough and militant . But he still kept mum . <P> Next day the prestige of the U.S. presidency was at its lowest point in recent history . The nation was gripped by paralysis . The people 's cry to Washington to do something was an angry cry of incredulity at an impossible , intolerable situation . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogged down in ludicrous futility . Pointing up the fact on countless front pages was that silly picture of the President eating ice cream . <P> High Pressure . That morning the President told his Cabinet members that his mind was made up ; he told them his plan of action . He set the timing himself : he would make a nationwide broadcast to the people that night , personally take specific emergency anti-strike proposals to Congress the next day . The usually cool Missourian had his dander up . Late in the day he had a swim and his periodic physical checkup . Reported his physician : the President 's blood pressure was " way up yonder . " <P> Four hours before he was to broadcast , the President , sitting in the spacious White House study , began to put down in longhand what he wanted to say . He discussed it with his advisers , and Judge Samuel Rosenman , summoned from New York , put some razor-sharp edges in it . <P> Then Harry Truman went on the air . <P> The New Truman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners* heard a Truman they had never heard before . Said he : " The crisis of Pearl Harbor was the result of action by a foreign enemy . The crisis tonight is caused by a group of men within our own country . " <P> The gloves were off , and the rough , clenched hands which had once guided a plow through the rich Missouri soil were there for all to see . Having compared the Trainmen 's Alexander Whitney and the Engineers ' Alvanley Johnston to enemy agents , the President went on to denounce them in the strongest language he could use over the radio . Time &; again he referred to " these two men , " " Mister Whitney and Mister Johnston , " - with mounting scorn . <P> He told what they had done . They were bringing industry to a standstill . Home-building was interrupted . Other men-good union men-were being thrown out of work . Stopped production was aiding inflation . <P> The President 's voice , determined but quivering at first , grew more assured . " I shall always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
