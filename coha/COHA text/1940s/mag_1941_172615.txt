The New York Daily News sent post cards to 10% of the State 's 6,960,117 registered voters , asking : " Shall the United States enter the war to help Britain defeat Hitler ? " Of the 696,011 voters , last week 174,309 ( 25% ) had responded-51,507 , Yes ; 122,802 , No . Score : Go in , 29.5% ; Stay out , 70.5% . Publisher Joseph Medill Patterson editorialized : " If , contrary to his 1940 campaign pledges , the President leads or pushes us into this war any time soon , he will be taking an unwilling people into a hated war . " The newspaper anticlimactically observed : " In such event , the President must risk the verdict of history . " <P> Publisher Patterson knew that he too was risking the verdict of history . The multimillionaire publisher of the biggest U.S. proletarian newspaper had asked a loaded question , had drawn a loaded answer . There is a difference between wanting to go to war and being willing to go to war-no sensible citizen in any country wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a further difference between being willing to go to war " to help Britain " and to save the U.S. from grave danger . Careless questions certainly could not probe the present complex U.S. state of mind . <P> In the News poll the most striking fact was that almost 30% of the answerers were willing to go to war now . Dr. George Gallup 's scientifically conducted Institute of Public Opinion , in a special New York State survey ( monthly-for-23-months ) , could find only 21% who wanted to go to war , 8.5% less than Publisher Patterson 's poll . Obvious conclusion : instead of chortling at the lack of war fever , Publisher Patterson should be brooding over its high reading on his own thermometer . <P> In Illinois , Colonel Patterson 's cousin , multimillionaire Isolationist Colonel Robert Rutherford McCormick , simultaneously conducted a poll in his Chicago Tribune on the same question . Of 257,484 post cards mailed to every tenth voter , 77,229 ( 30% ) answered : Yes ( for war ) , 14,176 , or 18.36% ; No ( against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked almost exactly with Dr. Gallup 's month-by-month poll of Illinois sentiment . Obvious conclusion : Colonel McCormick would have saved thousands of dollars by reading Dr. Gallup 's polls , which regularly appear in the rival Chicago Daily News . <P> Four other polls made news : <P> &gt; In Montana the Great Falls News asked voters : " If Senator Burton K. Wheeler were a candidate for re-election today , would you vote for him or against him ? Did you vote for Wheeler for Senator last November ? " Result , projected from early returns : Isolationist Leader Wheeler would be defeated by from 100,000 to 150,000 votes ( last autumn he won by 112,812 ) . <P> &gt; In Virginia the Richmond Times-Dispatch began a poll on the question : " Shall the United States enter a shooting war against Germany now ? " Early returns : Yes ( for war ) 450 or 45% ; No ( against war ) , 550 or 55% . <P> &gt; This week Dr. Gallup polled Who 's Who in America , asked the U.S. 's most prominent and successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , said 45% ; stay out , 55% .
