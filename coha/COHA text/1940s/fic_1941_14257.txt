For some ten minutes or more before our play starts , a bagpiper in full Highland dress moves up and down in front of the theatre playing old Scottish tunes . As the overture is about to begin , he goes inside the theatre , down one aisle and up another and out , playing as he goes . The theatre music then strikes up the overture and continues . At that section marked " The Highland Widow 's Lament " the house lights come slowly down to half-dim and hold while the latecomers in the audience are being seated . The overture concludes , and the lights go down and out . The music begins " Flora McDonald 's Lament , " and immediately the light comes up on the center stage . The Chorus enters from the right and left center singing . The singers are dressed in the ordinary clothes of the times  --  being actors of the cast . Their movements are relaxed and there is no formality in their arrangement . They face the audience with their rich and dynamic harmony , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the heather sae green , And down by the corrie that sings by the sea , The bonnie young Flora sat sighing her lane , The dew on her plaid and the tear in her e'e.She looked at the boat wi ' the breezes that swungAway on the waves like a bird on the main , And aye as it lessen 'd she sighed as she sung , " Fareweel to the lad I shall ne'er see again ! Fareweel to my hero , the gallant and young , Fareweel to the lad I shall ne'er see again ! " During the singing , Mr. Mac , the genial and kindly narrator , enters from the left center and comes along in front of the group . He smiles and nods to the singers and adds his voice to theirs . The song finished , the Chorus retires into the background . Mr. Mac steps forward and looks out at the audience . p. 3 MR . MAC ( Buoyantly , cheerfully . ) Good evening , everybody . A hearty welcome to you all . I am the narrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events of the play as we go along . The people call me Mr. Mac , and the author said he chose me to act this part because he found out that I was not only one of the God-blessed Macs but also something of a Cape Fear Valley historian . ( The Chorus has now disappeared into the darkness . Mr. Mac continues as he moves over to the right . ) Our people came into this Valley more than two hundred years ago  --  yes , some of them more than two hundred and fifty years ago  --  landing from their little ships at Wilmington and pushing on up the Cape Fear River or overland to make their settlements . ( With deepened feeling . ) Here in the wilderness they built their homes , laid out roads and towns , cleared the forest and raised their schools and churches to the knowledge and worship of God and in friendship for one another . ( He bows his head , the light dims down on him somewhat , and the Chorus sings the old hymn " Dundee " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , our help in ages past , &nbsp; &nbsp; Our hope for years to come , Our shelter from the stormy blast , &nbsp; &nbsp; And our eternal home , Before the hills in order stood &nbsp; &nbsp; Or earth received her frame , From everlasting thou art God &nbsp; &nbsp; To endless years the same  --  Amen . ( The song dies out . Mr. Mac moves over to the right side stage and the light brightens on him there , fading from the center stage. ) p. 4 MR . MAC ( More business-like . ) Let us go back in our minds to Scotland at the middle of the eighteenth century . Here the Scots for generations had waged a tenacious struggle against the power of England . At the battle of Culloden in 1745 they were finally and disastrously defeated , and their leader , Prince Charles Edward of the House of Stuart , fled to the continent . Among those who aided in the patriot cause was Flora McDonald , and her last gesture in defeat was to save the prince from capture by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the now famous heroine was tried and imprisoned in the tower of London but later pardoned .

The light comes up on a section of the center stage , revealing a table over at the left front at which an English officer is sitting . A clerk is beside him with a great open book and two red-coated soldiers behind , one with a bayonetted musket and the other holding the English flag aloft . In front of the officer a poor Highland farmer is standing , his hat tucked under his arm . A little boy about six or seven years old is with him and holding to his hand. ) p. 5 OFFICER ( Concluding , commandingly . ) I swear . MAN ( Repeating . ) I swear . ( Pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his wrist . ) BOY ( With a cry . ) Father ! MAN A mark with my own blood  --  aye  --  BOY ( Vehemently , at the officer , his face quivering . ) You 're hurting my father . OFFICER Keep him quiet . ( The soldier with the musket steps forward and stands by the boy . ) MAN Ne'er mind , Dan . ( He puts his finger to his wrist and marks in the great book . The little boy bows his head , his shoulders shaking with sobs . ) OFFICER Like this mark , John Murchison , your sacred oath will never be erased . JOHN MURCHISON ( Bitterly . ) Sacred all right  --  for wi ' my woman dead , my house burnt , and my few poor acres ruined , I have no heart to break it now .

The soldier seizes him and after a short struggle gets it from him . ) OFFICER ( Angrily . ) Even the children suck hatred here with their milk . Take him out . BOY Give it back to him  --  give it  --  JOHN MURCHISON ( Putting his arm around him and leading him off . ) Nothing to do about it , Dan , nothing . Come on  --  back to our work .

Allan is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in good English clothes of the period . Flora McDonald is of about the same age , though looking much younger . She is slender and some- what below medium height , with a mobile spirited face and wide dark eyes . She wears a shawl over her head. ) p. 7 OFFICER ( Rising and bowing . ) At last  --  and a great day it is  --  sir and madam .

OFFICER He calls upon all his loyal followers and you to refuse the oath . His day is not set , he will yet rise again  --  he says . ( Mockingly . ) From his drunken hiding place in France he will rise again . FLORA MCDONALD Bonnie Prince Charlie will never rise again . We serve a better cause now , and may a just God witness that as we take this oath we shall abide by it . OFFICER ( Lightly . ) Amen !

The Officer recites . ) I , Allan McDonald of Kingsboro , and I , Flora McDonald of Skye  --  ( They repeat the words in unison. )  --  do swear and as I shall answer to my God in the great day of judgment  --  ( As they repeat this , Tammy Ochiltree , dressed in the well-worn tartan of the McDonald clan , edges forward from the right and watches them in dismay . He is a thin , middle-aged fellow and wears an old tam-o ' - shanter with two white gull feathers stuck in it . Hugged up against him he carries an old bagpipe strung with a strap around his shoulders. )  --  solemnly take oath that I shall never bear arms against the rightful King of Britain  --  ( They repeat this. )  --  that I shall forego all action , all tokens and symbols of separation  --  ( They repeat. )  --  and may I never see my wife ( husband ) and children , father , mother , loved ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed in battle as a coward and lie without Christian sacrament  --  ( They repeat and Tammy shudders. )  --  unburied and forgot far from the graves of my forefathers and kindred  --  ( They repeat. )  --  may all this come across me if I break my oath  --  in the name of my King and Almighty God . Amen . ( They repeat this , and Allan pulls out his knife. ) p. 9 TAMMY OCHILTREE ( Piteously . ) Not that , Master Allan , spare the blood . ( He springs in front of Allan . ) OFFICER ( Now noticing him for the first time . ) Who is this bold fellow ? TAMMY OCHILTREE Me , Tammy Ochiltree , of the Clan Ochiltree .

OFFICER Sacred or profane , do you swear to serve your King ? TAMMY OCHILTREE Yessir , yessir , I 'll take all the oaths under heaven 's high arch  --  but please sir , do n't make me damage myself with a knife . OFFICER Hold up your hand . ( He does so. )  --  Higher ! ( He reaches up on tiptoe. )  --  Drop it !

ALLAN AND FLORA Farewell . ( They go away into the darkness at the right , the two soldiers holding their musket and flag in salute . The Officer stares after her . ) OFFICER A brave and noble woman . Next ! ( The scene fades out and the light comes up on Mr. Mac again . ) MR . MAC But though the taking of the oath brought peace to Scotland , it brought little improvement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pestilence of nature took their everlasting and accustomed toll . And many died from the hardship of their lot  --  one of them being our John Murchison , who found no new life beyond the sea as he had hoped but rather the darkness of a Highland grave , leaving his orphan son , Dan Murchison , to grow up a shepherd lad on the stony hills of Skye.And thousands of people continued to migrate to North Carolina . They sent back glowing reports , telling of the balmy climate there , the rich soil , the great forests , the grassy uplands and reedy bottoms where their cattle grew fat in winter and summer . Flora and Allan McDonald were past middle age now with a family of children and grandchildren . But finally they decided to follow their relatives into this new land and leave the troubles of the old world behind.And on an afternoon in August , 1774 , the good ship Baliol waited at the little seaport of Campbelltown to take them to the new world  --  a world where already , unknown to them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very king they had sworn to serve . ( The light fades from Mr. Mac and comes up on the center stage. ) p. 12 p. 13 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 The wharf at Campbelltown , in Scotland . At the left front and running diagonally back into the shadows at the right rear is a stout wattle or paling fence about the height of a man 's shoulder and with sharp-pointed tips . A gate at the left front opens through it with a tall board sign on a stake beside it which says  --  " BALIOL , sailing for North Carolina . " At the right front is an old barrel or cask , and a few other casks and boxes are at the back . Old Tammy Ochiltree is sitting on a bundle of baggage in front of the gate . He is much the same as when we saw him last , except older , being now about sixty-five or seventy , and with wrinkles fish-netting his face . He wears an old pair of voluminous breeches over his kilt , and his tam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His old bagpipe is slung across his shoulder . He is holding a needle and thread in one hand and a ragged shoe in the other . He sings half-satirically and disgustedly with the unseen chorus which has begun " The Highland Widow 's Lament , " the music accompanying . TAMMY AND CHORUS O , I am come to the low countrie , &nbsp; &nbsp; Ochon  --  ochon  --  ochrie  --  Without a penny in my purse &nbsp; &nbsp; To buy a meal to me . ( He sews away on his shoe and calls irritatedly off. )  --  Hesh on ye mourning and complaining , will ye ! ( Wagging his head in mockery. )  --  Oh , and it 's me poor bonnie boys and wee pritty lasses set to sail across the wide ocean . Ochon  --  ochrie ! ( Loudly . ) And why should n't they be sailing away ? There 's naught here in this woeful land of Scotland but rocks and wind and a power of raging waters amongst the hills . And the people coughing out their lives in the freezing fogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the thread , he bends down to put on his shoe . Dan Murchison , now a stout muscular young man in his twenties , hurries in at the right front . He steps quickly over behind Tammy as if to conceal himself . Tammy springs up . Dan keeps looking off at the left front. )  --  Dan Murchison , what are ye doing here , lad ! p. 14 DAN MURCHISON ( Glancing around . ) Where are the McDonalds ? TAMMY OCHILTREE You mean where is Peggy MacNeill ? ( Accusingly . ) You followed her here ! DAN MURCHISON ( Sharply . ) Did I say so ? TAMMY OCHILTREE The family 's gone up the hill there , her with ' em . Ye 're a fool , Dan , to keep honing after her and she all set to marry her man that waits beyond the sea . DAN MURCHISON I 'm a fool  --  that 's right . Look . ( He points off . ) TAMMY OCHILTREE ( With a squeak . ) The King 's soldiers . DAN MURCHISON Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , Dan ? DAN MURCHISON I 'm called to be impressed into the army . Whist ! ( He looks about him once more , then dashes away at the right rear . Tammy starts after him , then comes slowly back to his seat . ) TAMMY OCHILTREE Poor fellow  --  ( He holds up his old shoe , looks at it , and begins sewing again . The Chorus resumes its singing , and he joins abstractedly in. ) p. 15 CHORUS AND TAMMY O farewell , Scotland , forevermore , &nbsp; &nbsp; Ochon  --  ochon  --  ochrie  --  We 're sailing to a furrin shore  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; In North Amerik-ee .

Poor old Dan . p. 16 FIRST SOLDIER We do not , we mean young Dan Murchison , a wild shepherd lad . He 's wanted for the King 's army . TAMMY OCHILTREE Lordy-mercy . FIRST SOLDIER He 's hid on that ship . TAMMY OCHILTREE He is not . He 's back home tending his sheep on the Isle of Skye and lonesome for me this minute . SECOND SOLDIER But he 's been traced here .

He 's gone with my mistress to say farewell to the old castle  --  ( Gesturing. )  --  they 'll be here any minute . p. 17 FIRST SOLDIER Is your mistress by any chance Flora McDonald ? TAMMY OCHILTREE Aye , the same that saved bonnie Prince Charlie and made you English a laughing stock forever . FIRST SOLDIER Yeh , a laughing stock ! ( Reaching out he flings Tammy from the gate and strides on through . ) TAMMY OCHILTREE ( Calling furiously after him . ) You 'll ketch it ! The Captain 'll have your blood !

And Mistress Peggy MacNeill too  --  her to be married there to Master Cameron MacLaughlin that waits for her . SECOND SOLDIER ( Teasingly as he edges up by Tammy . ) I hear tell there 's buffalo critters in that strange country big as a house and bears that swallow a man at a gulp . TAMMY OCHILTREE No. p. 18 SECOND SOLDIER And Indians that slip up on you in the dead of night , and take your hair , dripping wet with blood and half your head with it .

( The bright gay voices of young girls are heard off at the left side stage . The light comes up there and several girls enter , grouping around Peggy MacNeill as they come. ) p. 19 FIRST GIRL Think of it , Peggy  --  you 're going to North Carolina !

With him is a minister and several townspeople . ) THE MAYOR OF CAMPBELLTOWN ( Stooping and smiling benignantly around him . ) It warms me in my heart to see ye all so happy in this hour of farewell .

Flora McDonald ! ( They all turn toward the right . The light has come up on the right side stage showing the approaching procession . Other people come in at the right center . A flourish of trumpets sounds in announcement and then breaks into the melody , " Hail to the Chief .

They are all wearing good but sober English clothes of the time . The pantomime of greetings continues as the song goes on . The Mayor steps out in front when the song ends . The captain is now stationed over at the gate. ) p. 21 THE MAYOR OF CAMPBELLTOWN ( Bowing . ) My lady and you , sir , this humble village and the county of Kintyre  --  aye all Scotland herself , join me at this hour in saying Hail and Farewell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all .

Flora looks up at Allan . ) ALLAN MCDONALD ( Hesitating and then going ahead . ) Mr. Mayor and friends  --  your kindness inspires us with more courage to face the days ahead of us .

May we forget , forget it all in Carolina where we are going . Peace is there , peace and love for one another in that new world . MINISTER Amen . ( The people applaud . The two soldiers come marching Dan Murchison in from the right . His arms are bound behind him .

Untie him . ( Allan passes over the money to the First Soldier as the Second Soldier unties Dan 's hands . Dan stirs happily about him .

Dan rushes forward , seizes another heavy bundle and lifts it gleefully aloft . The music strikes up " Hail to the Chief " again , and the Chorus begins singing as the people move through the gate toward the ship . Bonnets and shawls and handkerchiefs are waved on high and one of the men lifts the ship 's sign up and waves it . ) PEOPLE AND CHORUS Moored in the rifted rock , Proof to the tempest shock , Firmer he roots him the ruder it blows  --  Monteith and Breadalbin ' thenEcho his praise again , Roderich Vich Alpine dhu ho ! ieroe !

The town turned out in welcome and the city 's single onepound cannon fired off its thunderous salute . And it was with troubled , jealous heart that young Dan Murchison saw Cameron MacLaughlin meet Peggy MacNeill , his bride-to-be , with a kiss . Still they were not married yet , and beyond the present Dan would not think.The first care was for a home . All reports spoke of the grazing and farmlands up the Cape Fear River . The family loaded their belongings on a flatboat and with the help of hired Negroes poled themselves along the winding stream until they came to the village of Cross Creek , now our Fayetteville.And here many of their old neighbors and acquaintances from back home  --  the MacGregors , MacKays , MacDougalds , Camerons , Darrochs , MacAllisters and others  --  gathered to honor Flora and Allan McDonald in an evening of celebration .

At the rear coming out of the shadows is a panel or two of white plank fence which goes off diagonally to the right to join the unseen house offscene . Just in front of the fence is an iron wash-pot with the glowing coals of a died-down fire around it . When the light comes up , a gay and colorful folk dance is underway  --  at first a Highland strathspey to the tune of " The Bush Aboon Traquair , " which changes after a moment or two into a fast reel to the tune of " The White Cockade . " Some thirty or forty people are present  --  young , middle-aged and old . The young and middle-aged with one or two exceptions are doing the dancing while the older ones look enthusiastically on . As the dancing continues , other neighbors come down along the side stages and join the scene . Among the dancers are Allan and Flora McDonald , Peggy MacNeill and her handsomely dressed fiance Cameron MacLaughlin , Alexander Mc-Donald and his wife Annabelle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean , the florid and indefatigable Farquhar Campbell and his young wife Isabella , Alexander MacLeod and his wife Anne , the two McDonald boys , Sandy and Jamie , who are paired off with two bright-faced neighborhood girls , and other young people of the countryside . Among those looking on are old Hugh McDonald , Flora 's stepfather , " one-eyed Hugh " he is called , leaning on his cane , and Jennie Ban MacNeill , a jolly old Scotswoman with Anne MacLeod 's baby in her arms . Old Tammy with his bagpipe and dressed in his kilts is moving up and down , now and then cutting a few excited steps . Dan Murchison is at the pot tending to haggis cooking , stirring the contents with a paddle . An old serving woman is helping him . The strathspey builds in intensity and then with a swirl of music and movement changes into the speeded-up reel . Tammy lets out a whoop and tries to dance with Jenny Ban . She kicks at him and drives him off . He goes angrily over and stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands in time to the music . The dance goes on . Words break out here and there until all are singing . Tammy joins in , but Dan stolidly stirs the pot , his somber gaze now and then on the gliding figures of Peggy and Cameron .

They 've had some actual skirmishing at Lexington and Concord . But there 'll be no division here in the valley . The Scotsmen are going to stay united . And I 'll tell you why . ( Nodding at Flora . ) Because of her . She is the darling of every true Scotsman 's heart . She is our heroine . Ballads and songs have been written about Flora McDonald .

MAC And on his visit to New Bern Allan assured the Governor of his and Flora 's loyalty . But their one wish was , as Flora had declared so often , to live in peace . And there in Anson County they worked away on their new plantation . With the help of their servants and friends and young Dan Murchison they set about building a mill dam , clearing fields , and putting up fences . At last they had reached the haven where they would be , and life looked sweet and smiling ahead.Hour after hour , day after day , the sound of their axes , their saws and hammers could be heard in the wilderness , and beam by beam their house shouldered up its sturdy way , there among the pines above a flowing spring .

She makes a beautiful picture with her cap , bright skirt and red shawl . As she works away she hums to herself in time with the soft music . The sound of hammers is heard off at the right . The music strengthens , and Peggy begins singing in a clear , light , inner-absorbed voice . The hammering fades down .

Tammy stands bent over , his palms resting on his knees as he makes a great show of drawing in gulps of air . ) TAMMY OCHILTREE Ah Lord , what a wild man for work he is ! Shameful it is , the lifting and straining he has put upon me . PEGGY MACNEILL ( Gesturing . ) And look at the lifting you 've put on Dan .

( She passes the food around . ) FLORA MCDONALD Cameron has something to say . CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( As they all grow still . ) This  --  Peggy and I are to be married next week  --  the day of the festival in town . ( Dan stands without a sign to show that he has heard , while the others applaud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ad lib expressions of " So , it 's all fixed up at last , " " Good , " " Bravo , " etc. ) p. 53 ALLAN MCDONALD We drink to them . ( They lift their goblets and drink . ) CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN And everybody 's invited to Cross Creek on Tuesday . JENNIE BAN MACNEILL Half the lassies in Cumberland County are sick with envy , Peggy . ALLAN MCDONALD Some more wine . ( They hold their goblets out and Dan pours . ) CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( Bitingly to MacAllister . ) Even in the wilderness , Mr. MacAllister , we do not forget our loyalty . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Another biscuit , Peggy . ( He reaches for the plate . Cameron lifts his glass , Allan , Flora , Jennie Ban and the boys likewise . Peggy raises hers slowly , glancing at Dan . ) CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( Going on more loudly . ) Three thousand miles of ocean separate us from the throne . But there is no separation in our hearts . Long live His Majesty the King ! OTHERS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King . ( They drink . MacAllister swells with anger and then bursts out . ) ALEXANDER MACALLISTER You 're blind  --  blind as bats . Here in the wilderness drinking and toasting a figurehead that has no meaning any more . p. 54 JENNIE BAN MACNEILL Eat , everybody , eat and do n't listen to him . ( She goes for the food again , followed by Sandy and Jamie . ) ALEXANDER MACALLISTER I 'll have my say , I will . And it 's for your sake , Florie and Allan , I 'm telling you . I 've come over here to ask you to join our cause  --  just that . CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN There 's only one cause  --  ours . ( Allan nods , half-abstractedly . ) ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Listen to me  --  you  --  all of you . A struggle is beginning in this country against your King and parliament and  --  CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN Your King also . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER He 's not mine  --  CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN Then you are a Whig and a traitor ! ! ALEXANDER MACALLISTER And you , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the rest . ( Cameron controls his anger by dashing down the rest of his wine . ) ALLAN MCDONALD ( Gravely , earnestly . ) But scattered colonies like these can never raise a rebellion against the power of the empire . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER But they 're doing that very thing  --  and why ? For their liberty and rights . ( Earnestly . ) You are the queen of this valley , Florie . The majority of the people  --  we patriots  --  would follow you . I told you so . Then there would be peace amongst us  --  the peace you 've always talked about . You 've got to declare yourself for our side . ( Cameron throws out his hands angrily and turns his back on MacAllister. ) p. 55 ALLAN MCDONALD In Scotland we took an oath of obedience to the King . Now you ask us to break that oath . FLORA MCDONALD And go against the principle we believe in . JENNIE BAN MACNEILL Old Alec 's got no principle , Flora . He do n't understand you . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anguish . ) Leave us alone , Cousin Alec . Please ! ALEXANDER MACALLISTER When I first came over here thirty-five years ago , I too was all for the empire  --  feeling myself a part of its great power in the world . And then gradually something  --  I do n't know what it was  --  something in this wilderness and the struggle to tame it that gives a man a feeling of self-reliance , of  --  CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( Turning angrily back . ) Yes , liberty  --  we know the word . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER ( Almost with a shout . ) Liberty ! ( Quieting down . ) And every man gets the urge to be his own master , to go and come as he pleases , to worship as he pleases . He resents the meddling of parliament and oppression of the King and wants to have his own government , something he has created and has a voice in. p. 56 FLORA MCDONALD ( Pleadingly . ) The people here have their own government , their assemblies and houses of burgesses , guaranteed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by royal governors under the King  --  to be dismissed , to be called , to be instructed as they see fit . Oh , I 've seen it all happening under my very eyes . My own bond servants caught this new spirit . I freed every one of ' em and helped them get their own start . And they are standing with us to a man . SANDY MCDONALD ( To Jamie , softly . ) Come on . ( They move off at the right , with their hands full of food . ) CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( Vehemently . ) If we have war , we 'll all be in it , and Cousin Flora and Cousin Allan will lead the clans to victory against the rabble of servants and discontented rogues . FLORA MCDONALD ( With almost a cry . ) No . Cameron ! ALEXANDER MACALLISTER And that would be a bloody civil war  --  Scotsman against Scotsman  --  as before . CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( Rushing on . ) Bang go our guns , and the riff-raff scatter to hide in the ditches and fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This country 's going to separate itself from Britain as sure as there 's a God in heaven . Everywhere up and down the land the workers , servants , the poor people are banding themselves together in a common ideal . Poles and banners are being set up in the towns . The Sons of Liberty are organizing and arming themselves . Call them riff-raff if you will , but they can shoot straight . ( Suddenly to Dan . ) I ask you  --  you 're a servant  --  what do you think ? ( Dan stares at the ground saying nothing . ) FLORA MCDONALD Give over this mad talk , Cousin Alec . We are all borrowing trouble for nothing . You can clear away , Dan . DAN MURCHISON ( Lifting his head . ) Standing here listening to him talk seems like I begin to see things ahead of me  --  things I 'd never been able to see before . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER ( Triumphantly . ) Hah-hah , what did I tell you ? ALLAN MCDONALD You can go back to work , Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear you , Master Allan  --  today I do . But if a a war comes and it 's a fight between the powerful that have everything and them that have little or nothing , you know which side I 'll take . ( Crying out , suddenly . ) Maybe that 's it  --  yes  --  ! ( With sudden loudness . ) Against all that keeps me down ! I 'd break my way through , push on , stand there somehow a free man and rid of this galling slavery forever  --  ( Striking his breast . ) Free here inside myself . p. 58 ALLAN MCDONALD ( Anger sweeping his great frame . ) Silence ! ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Hah  --  and there are thousands like him , Allan . I 'm warning you . ALLAN MCDONALD Dan Murchison , you forget your place . ( To the others . ) My apologies .

( Sandy and Jamie come hurriedly in . ) SANDY MCDONALD ( Excitedly . ) A British officer is here , Father , to see you and Mother . JAMIE MCDONALD ( Gesturing . ) And with soldiers and the flag . p. 59 SANDY MCDONALD ( Excitedly . ) It must be great news . FLORA MCDONALD ( In alarm . ) What is it ? ( A flourish of trumpets sounds . Colonel James Cotton , a tall British officer in full uniform , comes in at the right , accompanied by a flagbearer , three or four armed soldiers and a drummer boy . Tammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heels , and salutes . Cameron salutes sharply back . ) COLONEL JAMES COTTON Ah  --  Lieutenant MacLaughlin . ( He steps over and shakes hands with Cameron . ) CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( Indicating . ) My kinsman Allan McDonald , Flora McDonald , Cousin Jennie Ban MacNeill  --  and my fiancee Peggy MacNeill . ( He ignores MacAllister . Colonel Cotton bows about him . ) COLONEL JAMES COTTON ( To Allan and Flora in quick staccato words . ) You , sir and madam , are called upon by his excellency the Governor to meet with the loyal servants of the King in Cross Creek . ( Looking about him . ) Are you all loyal people here ? ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Aye , loyal to our belief . COLONEL JAMES COTTON ( To Dan . ) Who are you ? p. 60 ALLAN MCDONALD One of our servants , sir . COLONEL JAMES COTTON Um  --  ( To MacAllister . ) And what do you mean by your remarks , sir . ( Then , his face changing . ) Oh  --  Mr. MacAllister from the Cape Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need not ask are you loyal . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER You need not . COLONEL JAMES COTTON ( To Jennie Ban . ) And you , madam . Are you the King 's woman ? JENNIE BAN MACNEILL ( Puffing away . ) I am , as you might say , generally speaking . COLONEL JAMES COTTON Then my words are only for the loyal ones present . Governor Martin has called upon all the clans to meet at Cross Creek Tuesday . CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN Our festival day . COLONEL JAMES COTTON The same . FLORA MCDONALD And the purpose ? COLONEL JAMES COTTON To consider raising a Highland regiment . FLORA MCDONALD But there is no war  --  p. 61 COLONEL JAMES COTTON To raise a regiment to keep the peace as it needs to be kept . And you , madam , are most specially called for to speak to the people . ( Bowing . ) Because of your great influence  --  and you will be honored . FLORA MCDONALD ( Sharply . ) I seek no honor . COLONEL JAMES COTTON And you will honor us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tapping a document in his hand. )  --  issued in the King 's name . ( He hands the document to Allan who stares at it . ) ALLAN MCDONALD ( Finally . ) Set with the seal . ( He gazes over at Flora . She bows her head . ) COLONEL JAMES COTTON It is needful that they be obeyed . ALLAN MCDONALD ( Heavily , as he looks at Flora 's bowed head . ) We must go , Flora . ( Flora says nothing . ) JAMIE MCDONALD Hooray ! FLORA MCDONALD ( Her voice almost a cry . ) We want no hing of these troubles , sir . COLONEL JAMES COTTON And it is to prevent them coming that we must show our strength and authority . It need not distress you . The gathering will be in holiday mood of the festival . ( Saluting . ) Tuesday then  --  p. 62 ALLAN MCDONALD But you will spend the night here . COLONEL JAMES COTTON I must return immediately . ( To MacAllister . ) I trust , sir , you will take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACALLISTER It 's not my neighbors of Cumberland that need advice , but the folks here . And I declare to you , sir , if the Highlanders raise a regiment , the patriots will raise two regiments  --  and blood will flow in this valley . COLONEL JAMES COTTON As you prefer  --  ( He salutes again and goes quickly away , along the left side stage , followed by the soldiers and the flag-bearer . The music sounds its fanfare as they leave , and the drum beats . ) ALLAN MCDONALD ( With sudden energy . ) We must make preparations at once . You  --  boys . ( He gestures over the scene . Sandy and Jamie gather up the hamper and hurry gleefully out . ) TAMMY OCHILTREE Aye , and I 'll sharpen up my old broadsword . I 'd druther die fighting on the battlefield than be sweated to death in these here woods . ( He follows the boys off . ) CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN Let 's hurry and pack your things , Peggy . ( He takes the tray of goblets from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63 ALEXANDER MACALLISTER And I must ride back to my plantation tonight . ( Turning to Flora . ) Well , Flora , you still have time to make the right choice . FLORA MCDONALD Cousin Alec , I plead with you  --  use your influence with the people . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER And once more I ask you  --  will you join our cause ? FLORA MCDONALD ( Desperately . ) How can I ? How ? CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( Sharply . ) We must obey the orders of our King ! ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Then God help you all ! ALLAN MCDONALD Yes , Flora , we will go to Cross Creek  --  go and use whatever voice we have to keep the peace . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER And you will live to regret your going . Listen to me , Flora  --  JENNIE BAN MACNEILL Quit your persecuting the poor thing . ( Flora looks out at MacAllister , then lays her hand on Allan 's arm . ) FLORA MCDONALD Allan has spoken for us . ( MacAllister throws out his hands angrily . ) ALLAN MCDONALD Dan , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the men working until we return . p. 64 DAN MURCHISON Two more days I will , sir . ALLAN MCDONALD What ! PEGGY MACNEILL His service is ended then . ALLAN MCDONALD ( After a moment . ) You 'll stay with us . DAN MURCHISON No , sir . ALLAN MCDONALD ( Exasperated . ) But what will you do ? DAN MURCHISON ( Indicating MacAllister . ) If he 's right  --  I know what I 'll do . ( He picks up the table and bears it away at the right . Peggy hesitates and then she goes out , Cameron with her . ) ALEXANDER MACALLISTER ( With a smile . ) We 'll see you in Cross Creek . ( He goes toward the right by Jennie Ban . ) And what will you do in the coming struggle , Cousin Jennie ? JENNIE BAN MACNEILL I 'll be praying to a merciful God to paralyze your pizenous tongue . ( She turns to leave . MacAllister takes her arm in mock-gallantry , but she flings his hand off . He laughs as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at each other . She shakes her head as if trying to keep from breaking into tears , then looks away. ) p. 65 FLORA MCDONALD I 'm afraid , Allan , afraid . ALLAN MCDONALD ( Putting his arm around her . ) But what is right we must do  --  there is no escape . FLORA MCDONALD Our home  --  will we come back to it , Allan ? Will we ? ALLAN MCDONALD We will , I promise you . ( They go out at the right . The music comes pouring in , using the last three phrases of " Flora McDonald 's Lament "  --  beginning at the first " Fareweel "  --  to build to a quick and powerful musical finale . The house lights come on for the intermission. ) @x At the end of the intermission the music starts playing and the audience reassembles . As the overture comes into the melody of " Loch Lomond , " the lights fade down and out and from the darkness behind the left side stage the Chorus begins to sing . The music dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonnie braes , &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond , Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae , &nbsp; &nbsp; On the bonnie , bonnie banks o ' Loch Lomond . ( Mr. Mac enters from the right center and moves along to the left , joining with the Chorus . ) MR . MAC AND CHORUS And ye 'll take the high road and I 'll take the low road , &nbsp; &nbsp; And I 'll be in Scotland afore ye , But me and my true love will never meet again &nbsp; &nbsp; On the bonnie , bonnie banks o ' Loch Lomond . ( By this time Mr. Mac has reached the left side stage . The light comes up on him there , the center stage sinking into darkness . The Chorus hums the second part of the song in a wordless harmony . ) MR . MAC ( Over the background humming . ) And ye 'll take the high road and I 'll take the low road  --  Yes , some of us take one road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . ) So it was with the people in this valley and this neighborhood . They took two opposing and unyielding views  --  the question of liberty against loyalty to the King . And as so often happens in human thinking the differences would finally have to be settled in blood . Alarmed by the calling of the High- landers , the Whigs assembled at different points along the valley to be ready in case of trouble . And Dan Murchison , his service to Allan McDonald ended , put himself under the orders of the now Colonel Alexander MacAllister and Robert Rowan , a devoted patriot , and soon he became one of their most trusted messengers and scouts . And ever as he rode his lonely journey , the brighter shone the face of Peggy MacNeill within his mind , the fiercer burned her image in his heart . ( The light dims from Mr. Mac and comes up on the center stage , revealing a garden scene somewhat dimly lit and showing at the left rear beyond a scraggly bank of shrubbery the windows and arches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence with a gate crosses the left center and at the right center is a seat , with the protruding branch of a tree hanging above it . When the curtain rises the figure of a poorly dressed young working man , Fergus Buchanan by name , is seen standing at the rear close against the shrubbery . He apparently is listening to what is going on inside the hall , where ever and anon the sound of cheering and applause is heard . A bell begins ringing off at the right , much like a small dinner bell . Immediately Fergus turns toward the front and gives a spieling chant. ) p. 67 FERGUS BUCHANAN Sale tomorrow !  --  Sale !  --  Goods at half price at MacLaughlin and Campbell 's Store  --  Distilled spirits , molasses , Madeira wine , beer , ale and porter in bottles  --  coffee and cocoa  --  candles of tallow and wax and spermaceti  --  cheese and soap and boots and slippers  --  ( The night watchman , Jock McPhail , comes in at the right front carrying a lantern .

FERGUS BUCHANAN Master Cameron wo n't mind  --  if it brings him some trade . JOCK MCPHAIL Hah-hah . ( Raising his voice ) Ten o'clock and all is well . God save His Majesty the King ! ( He goes out at the left front , ringing his bell . ) FERGUS BUCHANAN ( Calling again . ) Pack thread and nails and spikes , salt and tobacco , snuff and indigo , pickled fish and dried fish  --  saddles , gloves and leather !  --  herbs of all sorts bought and sold  --  ( His voice dies out , and after looking carefully about him , he turns back to his listening by the shrubbery . Again the sound of applause and cheering is heard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . He is dressed in his usual work clothes and is splashed with mud from long riding . Fergus looks up and again starts his spiel . ) Wrought pins , pewterware and glasses  --  black bottles , china , stone  --  and earthenware  --  ( Dan gives a low whistle . Fergus peers at him and then hurries forward . ) Murchison , is it ? p. 68 DAN MURCHISON Yes . FERGUS BUCHANAN ( Grasping his hand . ) Welcome , brother . You 're late . DAN MURCHISON The Highlanders searched me at the bridge but found nothing . I carry it in my head . Who 's in there ? FERGUS BUCHANAN The leaders  --  the McDonalds , Colonel Cotton , Colonel MacLeod , the McLeans , Campbells , MacNeills , old Kenneth Black  --  I 've got the names of them all . Such speechmaking you never heard . Highlanders forever , they cry out , and drinking to the bride and groom ! DAN MURCHISON Hah !

They 're mad enough to kill you  --  you running off and jining up with old Alec MacAllister and spreading rebellion wherever you go . Off with you or I 'll call the watch . p. 70 FERGUS BUCHANAN ( From the shadows . ) Come on . DAN MURCHISON I want you to tell her  --  JENNIE BAN MACNEILL I 'll tell her nothing , Dan Murchison .

Jennie Ban stands staring before her , and then sinks down on the seat , her face thoughtful . Gay voices are heard singing beyond the fence .

Presently the crowd separates and gathers on the right and left , leaving a space immediately in front of Flora and Allan . The dancing girls turn their backs to the audience in the theatre and perform especially for Flora and Allan . Flora nods and smiles and for the moment forgets whatever fear and cares are haunting her . Allan is jubilant , his broad face crinkling with smiles .

Now she must bow her head to the cruel merciless fact , but she would stand by her husband and her people and trust in her God that the storm would soon be over and the right would prevail . It was too late to draw back now . Though her heart might break , she would throw herself into the cause with all the energy of her devotion .

( The music begins a gay fifing melody of " Now Away , My Brave Boys , " with a snare drumbeat accompanying . The light comes up on the left side stage showing an ad lib pantomime scene of parting . The music continues its mocking contrast . A soldier is standing at the right holding a great waving flag . Anne MacLeod in tears is clinging to her husband , Alexander MacLeod . Allan with his sword buckled on puts his arm around Flora . Cameron comes in from the left and kisses Peggy goodbye , then hurries down toward the center stage and on into the darkness at the right rear .

MacLeod pulls Anne 's arms from around him and goes . She turns sobbing against Peggy 's bosom . Flora gazes after her boys , lifting her handkerchief and waving toward them as they disappear . Allan looks after them , kisses Flora , and starts away . Old Tammy comes tearing in , his long claymore in his hand . Allan turns and in stern pantomime orders him back . Tammy is seen pleading with Allan to let him go fight . Allan gestures to him to look after the women there . His bravery is needed at home . Tammy in pitiful resignation goes forlornly back to the left , beckoning with his hand for the women to come . Allan goes away into the darkness , the soldier following with the great flag . In the distance at the right Cameron is heard giving a sharp command to the company as Captain Allan approaches. ) p. 103 CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN Attention !

( The sound of marching feet is heard offstage . ) Hup  --  hup  --  hup  --  ( Allan 's voice and the sound of marching die away . The fife and drumbeat fade down . A moment Flora stands so , then bowing her head suddenly into her shawl , turns swiftly into the darkness . The scene blacks out . The bugle sounds a final call  --  **26;1769;TOOLONG and is silent . The light comes up on Mr. Mac again on the right side stage . ) MR . MAC With flags flying and bagpipes blowing the jubilant Highlanders marched toward Wilmington . Their intent was to invest the town and join forces with the expected British fleet before the Whigs could arrive . But Richard Caswell and Alexander Lillington were determined they should never reach there . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge ahead of the Scotsmen who must cross there . Breastworks were thrown up , and as tradition has it the planks of the bridge were removed and the stringers greased with soap and tallow . Let anyone try to cross who dared . And there before dawn on February 27 , 1776 , the exhausted but watchful Whigs huddled among the reeds and trees waiting for the enemy . ( The light dies from Mr. Mac and comes up in a gray foggy murk on the center stage. ) p. 104 p. 105 Act 2 , Scene 3 Scene 3 The woods at Moore 's Creek Bridge . Some dozen or more Whig soldiers are in the background , some of them squatting on their haunches , others sprawled on the ground , their muskets hugged close to them . The mood of the scene is one of suspense  --  of waiting , waiting . The Chorus from the darkness at the far rear has begun a deep harmonious singing , drenching the funereal air with its grim and mournful sound . CHORUS ( Accompanied . ) Scots wha ha'e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led , Welcome to your gory bed , &nbsp; &nbsp; Or to victorie . Now 's the day and now 's the hour , See the front of battle lower , See approach proud Edward 's power , &nbsp; &nbsp; Chains and slaverie . ( The singing dies . A noise is heard off at the right rear . Fergus , who is now a sergeant , springs up , his gun at the ready . Others lift their guns . Dan comes in accompanied by a soldier with a jug . ) FERGUS BUCHANAN ( Saluting . ) Lieutenant Murchison . DAN MURCHISON ( Saluting back . ) The outposts all set ? FERGUS BUCHANAN Yes sir . p. 106 DAN MURCHISON How 're the men ? FIRST SOLDIER ( From the muffled darkness . ) Cold . SECOND SOLDIER Wet and freezing . DAN MURCHISON Here 's some drink to warm you .

DAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left front and stands staring watchfully out . The men relax . The muffled harmony of the chorus comes in again . ) CHORUS By oppression 's woes and pains , By your sons in servile chains , We will drain our dearest veins , &nbsp; &nbsp; But they shall be free . Lay the proud usurpers low , Tyrants fall in every foe , Liberty 's in every blow  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us do or die . ( The singing dies down to a low humming in which the soldiers join for a moment . Suddenly the music gives a warning cry . The men spring to their feet . Dan runs over to the right , looks out , then draws his sword. ) p. 107 DAN MURCHISON To your posts  --  every man ! ( The soldiers scatter to the left and right rear , secreting themselves behind the shrubbery . Dan goes last . In an instant the scene is empty . The music begins an ominous and staccato arrhythmic rendering of the former melody . The light comes up dimly on the two side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Highlanders are seen coming warily along , their muskets held in front of them . One or two of the leading figures , seeing no sign of the Whigs , beckon to those behind them . Others come on in , moving as if in time to the weird music . Some of them go through the side entrances and others move on straight down the ramps or runways toward the center stage . Allan McDonald comes along the right side stage , as Captain of the men there , his sword drawn , a flag bearer with him . Over on the left side stage Lieutenant Cameron MacLaughlin is in charge . The music breaks off and sounds the trumpet of alarm . From behind the shrubbery a nervous musket fires a trigger-happy shot . ) ALLAN MCDONALD ( With a high cry . ) King George and broadswords !

Flashes of guns and explosions are seen in the distance . Dan and his men run in from the left rear , driving the Highlanders out at the right . The Whig flagbearer is among them , waving his flag , a blue and yellow strip of cloth , wildly summoning them on to victory . The British flag flees before it . The tumult increases . Here and there a Scotsman goes down , twisting convulsively . Smoke swirls up over the scene , hanging heavy in the blanket of wet icy air . The music has continued to mix its loud din of discordant sound with the fervor of battle . Dan leads his men back across the scene , his sword lifted . Cameron comes in from the right with his shattered force to a renewed attack. ) p. 108 CAMERON MACLAUGHLIN ( Waving his sword . ) Across the bridge ! Follow me !

Cameron staggers , turns helplessly about , stumbles toward the right rear and collapses on the ground , then topples forward on his face and is still .

( The Whig flagbearer runs back through the scene and on out , yelling as he goes . ) A FLAGBEARER Victory ! Victory ! ( The music gives a forlorn trumpet call and the sounds of battle slowly trickle down and out in its descending notes . Dan turns toward the fallen Cameron and kneels by him . Some of the men gather around . Dan takes off his cap , and a few of the others in respect do likewise . ) DAN MURCHISON Cameron MacLaughlin . ( After a moment . ) He was a brave man !

Dan picks up Allan 's fallen sword , looks at it an instant , and then follows after . The music plays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead march tempo . The scene blacks out and the light comes up on Mr. Mac on the right side stage . ) MR . MAC The victory of the Whigs at Moore 's Creek Bridge saved North Carolina for the patriots and broke the power of the Highlanders forever . In the months that followed , scenes of great cruelty took place up and down the valley  --  comparable to those Flora McDonald and her people had endured in the clan wars in Scotland . Hate ran loose , parties of irresponsible Whigs roamed up and down the river capturing the disorganized Highlanders , pillaging and burning , driving off the cattle , beating and waylaying , murdering even . Fire and sword were the rule now . And there at her home in Anson County , Flora McDonald carried on her life in the wreckage of her dreams as best she could  --  with one hope now , to free her husband and son from the prison at Halifax where they were held . And Tammy continued to be her faithful old servitor , loyal and sworn to valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac . The music plays the first five bars of " Flora McDonald 's Lament " in a tempo of sorrow , holding on the last note . The light comes up on the center stage. ) p. 111 p. 112 Act 2 , Scene 4 Scene 4 A large open room of Flora McDonald 's home at Killiegrey , the yard showing in front and to the side . It is a rather striking interior in a frontier or backwood manner . A rough table is at the center back . Over at the right front is a fireplace and to the right rear a door , and to the left front another door leading to an inner room . At the center back is a large window with rich hanging curtains of the clan tartan . To the left of the window and spread out on the wall is a British flag . At the right of the left door are portraits of Allan McDonald and other McDonald chieftains dressed in their warlike regalia . A few antique Scottish chairs are scattered about . When the curtain rises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving himself commands and awkwardly executing them . TAMMY OCHILTREE Shoulder arms . Right about . Forward march . ( He marches a few steps . ) To the rear , march . ( He bangs the musket down on the floor and wipes his forehead with his sleeve . ) Dang my soul if I can learn this stuff . What 's the use of all these here commands when a man 's got nothing to do but aim and load and shoot ? ( Commanding himself . ) Ready , aim , fire  --  and all by the book . ( He does so , stamping the floor to give the shot , even frightening himself . He consults a little book lying on the table . ) And that was the trouble at Moore 's Creek Bridge . Too many commands and not enough execution . Now here are them Whigs  --  ( Indicating a place on the floor. )  --  and here are us Tories . We come a-marching up . Lay down your arms we say . But they lie still and say nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fours , men  --  And do we come walking into death with their bullets flying through the air  --  zip-zip ? No sir .

( He goes through some antics of stabbing the enemy . ) Then hand to hand we engage ' em . ( He drops his musket and seizes his own throat choking himself ( a Whig ) down to the floor in a terrific onslaught . MacAllister comes spryly up in the yard and bangs on the side of the house with his cane . Tammy clambers to his feet in terror and grabs his musket . ) Go away , go away . There 's nobody here but me  --  poor old Tammy . Go away . p. 113 ALEXANDER MACALLISTER It 's me  --  Colonel MacAllister . I 'm not going to hurt you .

TAMMY OCHILTREE In a manner of speaking  --  sir . But Lord protect us , there ai n't much to guard . Two weeks ago the Whigs come and taken our corn and threatened to burn down our house  --  and Mistress Peggy begging ' em on her knees not to . III-sick she was , but a-begging of ' em . Then they go away and another crowd marches up in the yard . They taken the silverware and what little meat we got in the smokehouse . And now you come  --  Oh , say you wo n't harm poor mistress .

Three weeks ago the first child was took sick and it died and we buried it down there , and yistiddy the other one . Ochon  --  Ochrie  --  and I am left to watch over the ruins of this house .

TAMMY OCHILTREE Mistress Jennie brung us something yistiddy  --  all the way from her mill she did . Kinsfolk ort to hold together , she said , Whig or Tory !

PEGGY MACNEILL Every day I expect to hear something dreadful 's happened . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER ( Consolingly . ) Not to Dan Murchison . If we had a thousand men like him we 'd win this war in a month . PEGGY MACNEILL And it will be ended soon , wo n't it ? ALEXANDER MACALLISTER It will .

ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Aye . Flora doted on her grandchildren and had great hopes for them . ( Shaking his head . ) Ah , but I warned her , pleaded with her and Allan , but it did no good . ( The door at the right rear opens , and Jennie Ban , Flora , Anne and Jamie come in . Anne is crushed with grief , and the few months of suffering have left their mark on Flora .

ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Florie , I 've come to have a final talk with you  --  p. 117 FLORA MCDONALD Final ? ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Before it 's too late . The Whig leader , Colonel Alston , is marching down this way , burning and laying waste all Tory property . ( Flora is silent . ) I sent a messenger to Dan Murchison , urging him to meet me here quick as possible . Whether he 'll arrive in time , I do n't know . Fire and sword are loose , Flora . This is no organized warfare in the Cape Fear Valley now , but a bloody civil war . JENNIE BAN MACNEILL And you 've been a ringleader in bringing it on , Alec MacAllister . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER And , Florie , I 've come here to , ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American cause and thereby save yourself and your family . FLORA MCDONALD ( Turning to him , her voice strong and imperious . ) This war is not ended yet . We have just begun to fight . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER ( Staring at her . ) You 're out of your mind . FLORA MCDONALD It 's true we lost the battle of Moore 's Creek Bridge . But our people have shown their worth . The Highlanders are still fighting , and they will continue to fight , even in small bands . You are wrong . Washington and Jefferson are wrong . Time will prove it . The people are not united against the King . The majority are for him . Your Congress in Philadelphia is divided . And already reinforcements are being sent to General Clinton on the Cape Fear . p. 118 ALEXANDER MACALLISTER How do you know that ? FLORA MCDONALD Do you think I sit here every day and do nothing ? JENNIE BAN MACNEILL She 's become a regular Paul Revere , riding out at night . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER The British government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCDONALD No ! ALEXANDER MACALLISTER He sailed for Charleston three days ago .

( Quietly . ) Nor will I. ALEXANDER MACALLISTER You will sign it Flora  --  or you will be driven from North Carolina  --  aye , mayhap worse than that  --  It is a law passed by the General Assembly and is beyond me now . PEGGY MACNEILL You have influence  --  power . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER But no military authority . FLORA MCDONALD ( Staring ahead of her . ) I visited Allan there in his jail at Halifax . They offered him his freedom  --  a shameful freedom  --  if he would deny his cause  --  dishonor himself . He would not do it . p. 119 ALEXANDER MACALLISTER And he will be marched away to the cold wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  FLORA MCDONALD ( Suddenly crying out . ) This is some mad dream . The King 's men will come . Allan will be freed from prison , my boy will be freed , and we 'll have peace again . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER A mad dream , Florie ? Then you are the dreamer . And I have come all this distance to give you a last chance to save yourself . Peggy here knows it and that 's why she 's on our side . FLORA MCDONALD Peggy 's lost her mind to Dan Murchison , that 's why she 's on your side . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER ( Vehemently . ) You ca n't stand out against us , Florie  --  we  --  ( Suddenly there is the sound of shots in the distance . Peggy runs to the front and looks out .

And look , they put a hole plumb through the bucket and all the milk leaked out . p. 120 JENNIE BAN MACNEILL I tell you this , Alec MacAllister . If you let them Whigs come in here and do harm to Florie I 'll kill somebody if it 's the last thing I ever do . ( Looking at the gun , then handing it quickly to Tammy . ) Here , take your musket and go out and defend yourself like a man . TAMMY OCHILTREE ( Quavering as he takes it . ) Oh , I would but there ai n't no use  --  them frenzy-minded cut-throats  --  Oh , listen at ' em . They 're coming on like savage dogs , a-yelling and a-barking .

He 's named in the paper . ( Jamie springs across the room and seizes a piece of wood , but MacAllister hurries in front of him . ) ALEXANDER MACALLISTER No , boy !

JENNIE BAN MACNEILL I 'm not a Tory , but I 'd like to get my broadsword and cut your shirt off . Ai n't you got no respect for people  --  bursting into houses like this ?

It is cruel but it has to happen and things wo n't be like she said  --  ( Fiercely )  --  my country  --  our country wo n't . We 'll build it different  --  out of her very tears we 'll build it  --  ( He holds Peggy tightly to him . ) ALEXANDER MACALLISTER ( Jubilantly . ) Aye , lad , we will . Mistakes will occur  --  evil things will happen , but the glory of it  --  and what she 'll never see  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to wipe out these evils  --  to make our country what we want it to be . ( Staring at Peggy and Dan . ) Aye , that 's it  --  free men  --  like this document says  --  and responsible men . And in the symbol of you two like our young country beginning  --  ( His voice dies out and he gazes a moment at the floor. ) p. 128 JENNIE BAN MACNEILL And in the symbol of Flora McDonald  --  and the greatness that is in her , you , you old reprobate ! ( Shaking her head . ) For a minute seemed like she was right . And now seeing you , Dan and Peggy , standing there with the light on you , looking so fresh and young and hopeful  --  seems like you 're right . Yes , maybe you are . DAN MURCHISON And we are right . ALEXANDER MACALLISTER Aye . Good night , Jennie Ban , I must hurry back to Cumberland . ( He turns and holds his hand out to her . With slothful reluctance she takes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door . ) Get them safely aboard ship in Wilmington , Dan . Even in her defeat I honor her . DAN MURCHISON I will , sir . ( MacAllister comes down out of the room and goes off at the right . ) JENNIE BAN MACNEILL ( Calling after him angrily . ) And I hope you are proud of yourself  --  you old  --  ( She searches for a word abusive enough but ca n't find it . Flora comes in from the right with a shawl over her head , carrying a little bundle under her arm . Following her are Anne and Jamie . They also carry bundles . ) FLORA MCDONALD We are ready , Dan . ( Tammy hurries and takes the bundle from her . He is sniffling back his tears. ) p. 129 DAN MURCHISON I have some horses brought up to the road there . FLORA MCDONALD I leave this to you , Peggy and Dan . Killiegrey is yours . PEGGY MACNEILL It will always be yours , Aunt Flora , yours ! We 'll keep it for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived , you must live . There is a laurel bush I planted by the spring . See that it lives . PEGGY MACNEILL ( Weeping . ) Yes , yes .

( Peggy nods her head . ) DAN MURCHISON Aye . ( The music begins reprising , " Flora McDonald 's Lament " as they all move out at the rear . ) JENNIE BAN MACNEILL ( Wiping her eyes with her apron , going last . ) Goodbye Florie , goodbye . ( For a moment the stage is empty and silent , save for one calling note in the music . Flora reappears in the door . She gazes about the room , then at the portraits on the wall . She picks up the flag and holds it to her . The music grows louder . She gazes about her once more , and then goes swiftly away , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final crescendo . The scene fades out , and the lights come on in the theatre. )
