While the bombers , southward flocking , <P> set Italian cities rocking , <P> Suddenly there came a knocking <P> at Il Duce 's office door . <P> He , with fiery decision , <P> opened to admit a vision <P> An expected apparition <P> who had often called before- <P> Destiny at hand once more . <P> Britain 's " Sagittarius " ( real name Olga Katzin ) has a nasty knack of rhyming world political events into their proper perspective . Her parody of Poe 's The Raven was given documentation last week by events in Italy . <P> Bomb-panicked families in Turin brushed aside the call of destiny , left their war jobs and trudged , across Alpine snows to Savoy and the French Riviera . They took their money out of the banks , tossed away their Party badges , spread their panic like a disease . From Turin south to Naples and on to Sicily the mass evacuation of city dwellers strained Italian railways . They carried bundles on their shoulders , slept in stables , begged food from farmers . <P> Reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vatican and historical treasures caused an influx there from other cities . Speculators took options on all available flats and rooms , charged fantastic prices . <P> All Italy awaited the Pope 's Christmas Day broadcast . A fortnight previously police had stood by helpless to interfere when thousands gathered before St. Peter 's at Papal services , chanting : " Long live peace ! " Embarrassed , the Italian press had tried to explain away the demonstrations as " obviously a tribute to the Pope 's efforts for peace before the war . " <P> Still more embarrassed were Government propagandists who had just issued pamphlets urging the Italian people to be as brave as the British were during the blitz . The Neapolitans had an answer for that . In the Cathedral of San Gennaro they knelt in prayer , mumbling : " Dear God . direct the bombers on to Rome . That is where Mussolini is . " <P> For the first time Rome radio admitted the retreat of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel 's German and Italian troops in North Africa , but tried to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead the British on . A popular quip became : " A clock moves forward saying tictac ; Rommel moves backward saying tac-tic . " <P> Along with the sledgehammer blow of air raids , the Allies kept up a propaganda war on frazzled nerves by promising more and greater bombings . The Germans moved anti-aircraft out of northern cities to danger points in the south . <P> The Germans took over the Italian air fleet of 3,000 bombers and fighters and demanded control of the island of Pantelleria , Italian naval base in the Mediterranean . Mussolini was either too ill ( of ulcers or mental distress ) or too busy to attend the reception for Pierre Laval in Germany ( see p. 23 ) . More likely he was too busy , for he still behaved like an aged errand , boy . He shook up his Party directorate and was reported to have fired General Vittorio Ambrosio , Army Chief of Staff , and General Ettore Bastico , Marshal of Italy and onetime Governor of Libya , for " unprincipled pacifism . " His own unprincipled imperialism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> Into that apartment regal <P> slunk instead a Roman eagle , <P> Moping , molting , and bedraggled
