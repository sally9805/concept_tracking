After 16 days of tumult and picketing , striking clerks , pages and elevator operators returned to their jobs on the New York Curb Exchange . The members of Local 205 , United Financial Employes , A.F.L. had won little : the Curb agreed to change its pre-strike offer of a temporary 10% cost-of-living bonus to a straight 10% wage raise , but it did not grant demands for a union shop and it insisted on a two-year contract . <P> The union continued its strike against the New York Stock Exchange . Some 700 Exchange workers were still out . But the brokers who pinch-hit for them had no trouble handling its booming business . In one day , 2,140,000 shares were traded , the biggest since April 14 , 1947 . By week 's end the Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 180.38 , up 0.90 from the week before and only 0.66 from the year 's high .
