txt A vigorous protest has been made to Great Britain against the removal by British authorities from British ships and American and other neutral ships of American mails addressed to neutral countries and the censoring of American mails on ships that have involuntarily entered British ports . Early assurances have been requested that the practices will be discontinued . The protest was delivered by the United States Embassy in London to the British Foreign Office on instructions of Secretary of State Cordell Hull after the matter had been studied by the State Department . The text of the note was made public by the department today without comment . " Violation of Immunity " The note charges " a clear violation of the immunity " provided by the Eleventh Hague Convention , which recognizes that postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents is inviolable on the high seas . The contention is made that the same rule obtains regarding such correspondence on ships that have been required by British authorities to put in to British ports . It regards as " particularly objectionable " the taking of mails from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four specific cases are noted of removal of American mails , totaling more than 1,700 sacks . Reference is made to " many individual instances " of British censorship of American mails . Some of this mail was addressed to Germany , but in other cases where the destination was the Netherlands , Belgium or other neutral countries the British claimed the mail was intended for Germany . One Exception Is Made No objection is raised in the American note to the censoring of private mails originating in or destined for the United Kingdom or which normally pass through the United Kingdom for transmission to a final destination . However the right is denied of interference with American mails on American or other neutral ships on the high seas or involuntarily in British ports . The note marks another representation against British interference ' with neutral rights . These include the protest against the British Order in Council for the seizure of German exports , wherever they may be destined ; the one in which the United States is associated with the other American republics against violation of the safety zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and informal representations against long delay in letentiOn of American ships for purposes of such search as is permitted by international law . Since the protest on German export seizures , no cases involving the United States have arisen . The issue of the safety zone is still undecided . The appeal for speedy search of American ships for contraband has borne fruit , however , I according to the State Department . This procedure , it was said today , had been accelerated . " Receiving Consideration " Wireless to Tile New YORK TinEs . LONDON , Jan. ** was no official reaction here tonight to the announcement that the United States had protested the interception of American mail beyond the statement that the note had been delivered ' and was receiving careful consideration . This answer was given despite the fact that , as was learned today , the United States note has been in British hands for more than a week . It was not delivered in person by Herschel V. Johnson , United States Charge d'Affaires , as most important notes are , but was merely taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Office remained reticent , the general outline // SEIZURE OF MAILS PROTESTED BY U. S. // of the British position in this matter is clear . Britain claims the right to intercept mail to or from Germany as a corollary to the Allies ' economic blockade of the Reich . The British regard currency as a definite and important contraband . They declare they have already been successful in preventing important amounts from reaching Germany . In a war in which wrecking the enemy 's , power of purchase abroad plays a big part , it is obvious , the British say , that interception of mails containing currency is vital . It is further argued here that mails can be used by Germans for the transmission of other contraband articles , which may be small in bulk but large in value . Diamonds are cited as an example . The British procedure with mail is similar to that with other forms of cargo destined or believed to be destined for Germany . When a neutral ship enters a contraband control base , either voluntarily or under an armed British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mails , is examined . If a cargo can prove to be not destined for Germany , the ship is released and any suspected mail is held by the boarding officer . Once it has passed inspection the mail is sent on by the next boat of the same line . Currency or any article designated as contraband is seized . There is apparently some difference of opinion between the United States and Britain as to the procedure being followed in the interception and censorship of mail that does not contain contraband . Any neutral ships  --  or , for that matter , planes  --  that voluntarily make regular stops at British seaports or airports must submit their mail for censorship . This is held here to he legitimate , in view of the use of British port facilities . However , it is said here that this procedure does not include censorship of mails on neutral ships intercepted by the British Navy and sent or taken to contraband control stations . Their mail , it was said , is examined only for possible contraband .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
