Silver-haired old Edwin Franko Goldman is dean of American bandmasters and a firm believer in himself ( as " internationally famous " ) and in the soothing magic of music . Bandmaster Goldman thought he knew one reason why G.I.s were so unhappy in the Pacific ( see ARMY &; NAVY ) : they did n't hear enough music , and what they did hear was awful . He had made a U.S.O. tour to the Philippines and Japan to lead U.S. Army bands . When he got back , he blew a loud blatt at the War Department : <P> " We found that many bands had members who could barely produce a sound on their instruments , had no knowledge of music and could not read it . ... In one instance we found that a ... band had not played . . . together for three months . <P> " The only musical organizations worthy of the name in the Pacific Theater are the Philippine Army Band , the Manila Symphony Orchestra , the Nippon Symphony Orchestra , the Tokyo Philharmonic and the Tokyo Metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
