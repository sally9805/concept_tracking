General Strike Due Today By GENE CURRIVAN By Wireless to THE NEW YoEx Taus . JERUSALEM , May 2 ? A letter was sent today by the Arab Higher Committee to the British . Cabinet , warning that if the recommendations of the Joint Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine are adopted , the Arabs willi resume " the national struggle . " The letter was sent to Prime Minister Attlee through the High Commissioner for Palestine , Lieut . Gen. Sir Alan G. Cunningham . The reference to national struggle concerns the Arab uprisings from 1936 to 1939 , which ended only after the British White Paper limiting Jewish immigration had been adopted . The note was " the next thing to an ultimatum , " Ahmed Bey Shukairy , director of the Arab Office , told The Associated Press . He said he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented the letter to General Cunningham 's secretary in a formal two-minute meeting , adding that " in our view , if Britain implements the report , those two minutes will pass into history as historical seconds . " THE ARAB NOTE TEXT The text of the note sent to London was as follows : In connection with the report of the Inquiry Committee , the Arab Higher Committee has decided to reject the recommendations in the said report . The Higher Committee believes the report was not the result of a free and innocent examination of the problem , but the outcome of American and British policy . Implementation of the said recommendations threatens the national existence of the Arabs in Palestine . In addition , it is a violation of ARAB CHIEFS WARN ATTLEE OF CONFLICT // the rights of self-determination , of the pledges to the Arabs by the British , of the Atlantic Charter and of the principles for which the Allies waged war . The Higher Committee declares the determination to defend the country with all the means at their disposal . Pending the decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs will proceed to organize national forces and prepare all means for defense in order to resume the national struggle . The Arabs shall not fail to take a path leading to the expulsion of this danger to sovereignty , liberty and independence . In view of the above , the Higher Committee presents this warning demanding refusal of the recommendations and the realization of our national demands . The entire Arab world is incensed at the report , which would permit 100,000 Jews to enter Palestine , and there are indications that this blow to their national pride may be the one instrument that can bring them together in one united form . Party factionalism and political schisms seem to have disappeared overnight , and it now has become for them one world  --  one Arab world . There was further indication of this budding unity today when the Higher Committee elected fifteen prominent Arabs to the committee , whose purpose is to raise what amounts to a war fund . It is to be called a national fund , and will be used to carry out the " national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other Arab countries and that an " international fund " may result . Most Arabs , regardless of their country , are deeply sympathetic toward the Palestinian Arabs , because they believe that the Jewish influence eventually may have no respect for orders , and if one Arab country is threatened with " invasion , " all are under the same threat . Earlier today , the Arabs took another step toward transforming their anger over the Anglo-Ar. - ? lean Committee 's report into concrete action . Mass meetings have been called , the support of neighboring Arab States is about to be implored and plans are being considered for a civil disobedience strike . Tomorrow , which is the Moslem Sabbath , all Arabs will go on strike throughout Palestine and possibly all over the Arab world as a manifestation of their complete disappointment and disgust . This strike , called for just one day , is a symbolic gesture designed to demonstrate to the world that in this instance the Arabs are of one mind and are united in their protestations . It is more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they firmly believe lies ahead if the Jews drive a wedge of 100 , - 000 immigrants into the heart of the country . The current Arab boycott against Jewish goods and services is a halfhearted measure at best , with many Arabs paying little attention to it ; but the newest effort is beginning to look as if they really mean business . After a six-hour emergency committee meeting , Jamal el Husseini , chairman of the Arab Higher Com- , mittee , announced that plans were being considered for a non-cooperation strike and that methods were being considered to rally the Arab youth of Palestine to the country 's defense . He declined to amplify this statement , but it obviously means that the Arabs feel their national existence is at stake and that they ' will take every means to combat the " invaders . " Representatives of the Higher Committee will start this weekend into the neighboring Arab countries to enlist their support in the forthcoming resistance movement . And starting May 10 , there will be a series of mass meetings in most of the towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
