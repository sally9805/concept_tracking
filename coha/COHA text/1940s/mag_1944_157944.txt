From a cautious experiment the Army had received an unexpectedly rich reward . A group of sinewy oriental soldiers , only one generation removed from a nation that was fighting fanatically against the U.S. , was fighting just as fanatically for it . Last week the War Department wrote " proved " on the experiment . It added a unit citation ( for " outstanding performance of duty in action " ) to the already-remarkable collection of medals held by the Japanese-American 100th Battalion . <P> Chary Beginnings . For almost two years after the attack on Pearl Harbor , young Japanese-American soldiers trained hard and all but unnoticed at a camp in the U.S. Then the news began to spread : they looked so good that the War Department began to recruit more from Hawaii . <P> The first group soon got a real test . Formed up as the 100th Infantry Battalion , they were sent to North Africa , attached to the 34th Division . To keep them a racial unit the War Department sent along 500 reserve Nisei to augment the 100th 's normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Coming Through . From the day of their first action-in Italy-the 100th had one tough fight after another . The stocky , brown-skinned boys , with their curious Hawaiian English , showed themselves good shots , doggedly resistant in combat . <P> Fifteen enlisted men won battlefield promotions . After Cassino , where they had spearheaded the crossing of the Rapido River and had clung to a corner of the town for many days , their combat strength was down to 120 men . <P> In the action at Belvedere , for which the 100th was officially cited , the divisional commander had to commit the battalion sooner than expected , to outflank a tough German position . With little artillery support the Nisei cut behind the position of some 500 Germans , knocked it to pieces , killed , wounded and captured 271 Germans . <P> After the capture of Rome the 100th was joined by its recently trained counterpart , the 442nd Combat Team , also Japanese-Americans . Both units are exceptionally popular in the Fifth Army , have a wonderful knack for organizing little comforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese-Americans have seen action at San Luce and Pastina . Last week their versatility was further recognized . They had pitched in with the Engineers to help rebuild the port of Leghorn . Said their commander , Major General Charles W. Ryder : they 're the best troops in the Division .
