What 's the good of bookplates if I never paste them in ? Why ca n't my permanent waves turn out like other people 's ? When will I learn that it is unwise to trust the dashboard clocks in cars ? And that I am the kind of driver other motorists mean when they say : " Humph ! Of course ! A woman driver " ? Why wo n't I ever wait till the bath salts melt , before I get in and sit down ( and yell , " Ouch ! " ) ? What am I keeping those old burned-out electriclight bulbs for ? And those old hats with snoods ? And that warped record of The Stein Song ? And that ancient memorabilia book I kept in boarding school ? And that slightly bawdy Christmas card signed " Snake , " whoever he was ? And those instructions from my air-raid warden about turning off the pilot light ? Why ca n't I erase things neatly ? Other people can . What 's my excuse for not remembering to register for the primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my men friends to explain things like cartels and the excess-profits tax , when I know to begin with I 'm not going to listen ? Is n't it high time I got over my childhood awe of schoolteachers , and clergymen , and maiden aunts with pheasants on their hats ? When will it dawn on me that I can not win at horse races ? What blinds me to such warnings as " Close Cover before Striking " ? And " Appointments must be canceled 12 hours in advance ? otherwise they will be charged for " ? Why ca n't I ever open one of those jars with the tin tops that say , so simply , " To open , pry up around edge with back of table knife " ? What on earth is the matter with me , that after my brilliant performance at changing a typewriter ribbon , I never can make the spools ( if that 's what they 're called ) go clear down on the spindles ( if spindles they are ) ? Sometimes I ask myself these questions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants ? And how do they come to be under the next table ? On what do I base my incurable hope that hats I 'm having made to order are going to look even remotely the way I thought they would ? When will I realize that a penny a point can bankrupt me at gin rummy ? and does ? Whatever gave me the notion that I 've got any card sense , anyway ? Is it impossible for me to master the intricacies of soap machines in public lavatories , and of Venetian blinds in guestrooms ? What makes me think I can wear red ? Whose are those books my house is filled with ? When am I going to get up courage enough to fly to Europe ? Why am I such a craven coward in airplanes , anyway ? me with my eyes squeezed shut , me with my back teeth clamped together till the inlays ache ? Me in my safety belt , like a sissy , at ten thousand feet , in tranquil air ? What can account for my conviction that today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put that sales slip without which I ca n't  | return that Little Horror of a sequinspangled satin dress ? Should I be psychoanalyzed , or shall I go on like this . Why do I quail when I 'm confronted by an income-tax investigator , or a lawyer , or a judge , or a policeman ? I have done no wrong . Am I the only living adult who ca n't read a road map or a timetable ? or who could n't get beyond page 16 of The Hucksters , for that matter ? By what process of self-delusion have I arrived at the belief that I can sing like a bird , that I make the best scrambled eggs in all Manhattan , that I know something about politics , that I look good in coq feathers , that I could be a designer or a decorator if I wanted to , and that I am an excellent judge of furs and wines and fiction plots and football strategy and boogie-woogie bands , and human nature ? Sometimes I ask myself . But there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
