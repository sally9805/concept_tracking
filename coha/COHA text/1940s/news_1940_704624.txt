txt The most elaborate and controversial nose-counting in the history of the United States got under way yesterday morning , when more than 120,000 enumerators , including 8,300 in the city of New York , began the decennial census required by the Federal Constitution . Along scores of Main , Center and Elm Streets throughout the nation ; in the Vieux Carre of New Orleans ; on Cleveland 's Euclid Avenue and Los Angeles ' Wilshire Boulevard , the trained statistic-hunters pur- ' sued their not too elusive quarry . In Boston 's Back Bay , Memphis ' Beale Street , Savannah 's Yama-1 craw , they carted their bulky portfolios into unpredictable homes , where in prescribed black ink they recorded what the government wanted to know . In this metropolis indications were that the job would progress smoothly and wind up within two weeks . Kirke D. Austin , area manager , had only smiles at the end of what some had foretold would be a day of headaches for him . He said no complaints against nonanswering citizens had reached his office and summed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been in touch with the Census Bureau in Washington and learned that everything was going along nicely all over the land , according to reports there . Aside from the nipping by a pet dog of a woman enumerator in Paterson , N. J. , the area manager said he did not know of the slightest untoward incident . This hinted that Me administrators were not worried over President Roosevelt 's admission at the Capitol , after a fifteen-minute session with Census Director William L. Austin , that he had failed the test despite willingness and even eagerness to tell all . The President , whose income was gravely recorded as " over $5,000 , " made it pretty plain he was striving to set for the nation an example of cooperation with the counters . First-hand surveys of many of the twenty-eight district offices in the five boroughs revealed nothing to upset the area chief 's optimistic summary . Supervisors in general reported their staffs had been received with unexpected courtesy , had encountered no refusals to reply and , if anything , had been made to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to be on their way  --  they make 4 cents every time they get another name on their sheet  --  often found themselves invited to breakfast , luncheon , tea or dinner , depending upon the time of their visit . The hospitality of one family took the form of a steaming bowl of between-meals spaghetti which was simply too much for the enumerator ; and another couple seemed almost hurt because their official guest could n't stay for at least a drink or a - cigarette . Enumerators who had feared the worst said they were scarcely ever asked to show their credentials . As for requests for form P-16 , which permits the questioned person to file the answers regarding his income by mail , there were virtually none . In one large midtown district enumerators were instructed to offer the special form before asking for the answers to the two questions Numbers 32 and 33 . The response , according ? to the supervisor who figured out the technique , was generally : " Aw , I do n't mind answering , I do n't want to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But despite the general harmony which prevailed , there were some cases of outraged individualists who at least momentarily expressed sentiments verging from either extreme toward the opinion of Senator Tobey of New Hampshire , No : 1 thorn in the census 's side . One woman in a high-rent area began explosively : " Imagine bringing a thing like that into one 's home ! " as she spotted the question blank . Another was more resigned , but sighed that only a dictator would do things that way . Both ultimately complied fully . So did the Rev. Dr. Nathan A. Seagle , rector of St. Stephen 's Protestant Episcopal Church , 122 West Sixty-ninth Street , who , after seven members of his household had been covered , suggested that the project was " Russian instead of American . " Asked to expand his views , Dr. Seagle provided a three-paragraph statement referring to himself in the third person and as " an American to the manner born and jealous of his personal ights and liberties . " " The doctor met the ' enumerator with the calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but with a fiery flash of the eye which indicated that he still has the spirit of a soldier eager for the fray . Those who know him know that he is not afraid of the word ' fight . ' " The statement referred to Dr. Seagle 's ancestry and ended : " The doctor himself before the retiring age served for many years as chaplain of the First Battalion New York Naval Reserves and has been a most loyal supporter of his country . He now feels that personal liberty is fast becoming a thing of the past and that the old idea of a man 's home being his castle is threatened . ' While he tried to be polite to the census taker , he nevertheless left no doubt as to his opinions concerning New Deal impertinence . He feels very strongly that the time has come when Americans should speak out and make themselves felt . " While keeping busy with squad leaders and enumerators working on a door-to-door basis , supervisors also had to plan for the census of institutions such as hospitals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such places some one on the institutional staff . The count at the House of Detention for Women , 10 Greenwich Avenue , was postponed until later in the week because it was visiting day , according to the supervisor of the district . Varied Locales for Interviews Interviews between enumerators and subjects ' took place in living rooms , kitchens , bedrooms , hallways , in lush-carpeted duplexes and in bandbox flats shadowed by passing Elevated trains . Some enumerators were more eloquent than others in reporting on " reaction , " and one woman assigned to several large Park Avenue buildings had a keen eye for detail . " It 's lots of fun , " she said , while waiting for her squad leader at a corner in the East Eighties . " There was one dear little 78-year-old woman , I could have kissed her . She said : ' Now , do n't you go and tell any one all about what I 've told you , ' and I said , ' Do n't worry , I " She told of having to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asleep at the time of her first call . " There was one woman who sat up in bed . She had on a pink maribou jacket and two dogs ? I mean there were two cute little dogs on the bed too  --  she was a blonde and her income was $9,000 . " Then there was another blonde . She was about 45 and she said , ' I only have an income of $60,000 . ' She was wearing a crepe de chine negligee , she sat up in bed too . " One man offered the enumerator a drink and a cigarette , she recalled , adding explicitly , " but his wife was there . " In general , she said , she thought the men liked to " waste more time " than the women . " One man got out a chair and a bridge table , " she went on , asking abruptly , " Do you know a lawyer named so-and-so , a very famous lawyer ? You should see his wife  --  she 's twenty years younger than he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had covered ran from $265 to . $423 . She had obtained forty-two names in fifteen households in three hours . Another woman , tired from what she described as a " fifteen-story walk-up , " asked if she had taken " all that this morning . ' The first woman nodded . " That 's wonderful , " said her discouraged associate . Questions Found Simple Another enumerator was discovered munching an egg-on-wholewheat sandwich in a near-by cafeteria . " They are all amazed the questions were so simple , " she said . " They all want to give you more than You want to know . I hit most of mine in their bath , and I had to wait , but everybody 's been very charming . " One woman was n't sure what her husband earned . She phoned and he said , ' Just tell her over $5,000 . ' " She took another bite of sandwich and went on : " They all try to tell how much over $5,000 they Make and I do n't want it . They all try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want it . Three out of eleven did n't know what their husband 's salary was and one said : ' All I know is , business is bad . I ca n't buy what I want to . ' " In an adjoining district centering in Yorkville , a slow-spoken male enumerator , with heavy rimmed glasses worn down on his nose , said his only problem had involved the woman who reiterated , " What is this ? " when lie appeared . He was n't at all bitter over the trouble she had caused him . " Some people are afraid to let strangers in , " he said gently . At a district office on East Fortysecond Street , a gray-haired man with torn seams in his overcoat was noncommittal and disconsolate over untold experiences in Tudor City . Had people cooperated with him ? " What do you mean , ' cooperate ' ? " he repeated dully . In Astor Place Supervisor Nathan Skolnik said the only complaint was that too many people were " askin ' ' em to stay for lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The enumerators did n't like to be held ' up that way , he made clear . In the office a heavy woman reported getting a scare when a man came to the door " with a razor in his hand . " " That was a ' flophouse ' : she should n't have gone there in the first place , " a superior said later . All hotels , including " flophouses , " are to be covered in the special transient survey next Monday . Herman Itskowitz , a lower East Side supervisor , said : " It looks like they never heard of Tobey in New York , " when telling of the cordial reception his staff had found . The leader of the unit covering Chinatown had three Chinese-speaking enumerators to handle an area where interviews are difficult . Mrs. Tim Mara of 935 Park Avenue , wife of the owner of the New York Giants ' football team , was the only one interviewed in her section to be reached for an opinion on the census-taker , She was generous in her praise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts , too , mothers with children on their laps sat in kitchen chairs , watched stoves and answered questions simultaneously . One Grand Street youngster of 3 ; z toddled up with a box containing three baby chicks . " Ya gon na count these , too ? " he wanted to know . It was that kind of day .
