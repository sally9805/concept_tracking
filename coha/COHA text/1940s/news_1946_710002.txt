txt NUNGAN , Manchuria , Dec. 2-A slow icy wind blows over the Manchurian plain . For miles the Human eye sees nothing but brown , bare land , frozen hard , with here and there a thin line of - trees around a mud hut . The sun 's rays seem barely to reach the earth through the thin mist overhead . A jeep jolts along over the ruts . Fastened to its hood by chicken wire is a thick , quilted cotton blanket , lined with dog fur , to protect the motor from sub-zero weather . In the jeep are four men , heavily bundled in bulky winter clothing . The driver is a Chinese general , dressed in American Army winter clothing from Alaska . Beside him sits an American correspondent . In back is seated Major Robert Rigg , assistant United States military attach ? for Manchuria . Next to him is perched a Chinese soldier , clad in Chinese quilted cotton uniform and carrying a tommy gun . The party is bound for the front lines in the Manchurian war between the Nationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty miles northeast of Changchun . Soon the jeep approaches twelve horsemen , mounted on stalwart little Mongolian ponies that caper and prance as the jeep snorts up alongside . Across the backs of the men are slung rifles , and from their belts dangle potato masher grenades . " Local militia , " explains the general . " We raise them in various // districts for reconnaissance and general scouting work . " The general exchanges a few words : with ? the leader of troop , a huge , dark-visaged Mongol with high cheek bones half hidden beneath the ear flaps of his furlined cap . A banner flutters in the wind from a ten-foot pole he has stuck in his belt . Tip Mongol waves forward and the jeep jumps ahead with a roar . Several Mongols lean low oVer their horses ' necks , urging them ahead in a wild short-lived race with the jeep . On the jeep goes , over ruts and ice-covered puddles while the wind blows in , cutting through layer upon layer of clothing . Suddenly , 100 yards ahead , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tall Chinese , dressed like the rest , approaches and salutes . The rest of , the men trudge silently past , their heads turning in interest half deadened by the cold to regard the occupants of the vehicle . Wear Canvas Sneakers Bundled thickly , they present a strange appearance , filing along in single lines , one on each side of the road . They wear typical Chinese winter uniforms of quilted cotton tunics and breeches with tightly wrapped cloth leggings . On their feet are canvas sneakers with rubber soles . All wear American Army helmets , piled high on scarves or socks or other bits of woolen cloth they , have wrapped around their heads . Many have slung their rifles horizontally behind their shoulders , with leather slings across their chests . Their faces are numb with cold . Mahy hands are blue while from their mouths come clouds of vapors as they pant into the thin blue air . Toward the rear shuffle soldiers bearing carrying poles , to the ends of which are slung cooking equipment , pots , pans and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and parts of mortars . At the end of the battalion creak several rude wooden carts , drawn by shaggy ponies . On ' the carts are heavier equipment and sick or wounded Chinese soldiers who try to , sleep in various positions . In a moment the general again puts the jeep in gear and it leaps ahead . " One of our battalions , coming back from the front , " he explains . " They 've been up the line several days . Their major says we will find a regimental command post about three miles ahead at Halahai . " Chinese Shout " 0 . K. " As the jeep passes the tail of the column one or two Chinese soldiers , noticing ' American faces beneath the heavy protective winter gear , grin and shout , " 0 . K. " One of the Americans raises his right hand and , with thumb up , answers in the traditional salute of American troops in China , " Ting Hao , " meaning " very good . " As the sun reaches its zenith in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plain . Surrounding it is a solid mud wall , twenty feet high . At the foot of the wall is a moat fifteen feet deep and ten feet wide at the bottom , which glistens with a small sinuous ribbon of ice . The jeep swings along the wall . coming to a heavy wooden unpainted gate , topped by bricks built in the form of a lookout post . The blue ribbed barrel of a light Japanese-type machine gun is visible through an opening in the bricks . The general drives quickly inside , past five armed Chinese guards , and steers through narrow dirt streets into a courtyard on the northern edge of the town . Standing huddled together in a line are twenty horses . Soldiers move about and military gear is neatly stacked along the ground . From the chimney of the end house smoke issues . As the jeep halts , four Chinese officers come running to greet the division commander . After introductions the general turns and gazes fixedly at ten soldiers , sitting Sullenly in a. row a few yards away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing on their feet but felt slippers , but most are warmly clad , some even with blankets about their shoulders . Some stare back ; others gaze moodily at the ground . Prisoners Are Communists " Communist prisoners , " the general explains . " They were captured yesterday , attacking not a mile from here . They are part of the Communist Third Division . " " What will happen to them ? " Major Riggs asks . " Most of them do not want to fight , at least not in this weather , " the general replies . " They are not hardened Communists , just local peasants who either joined up of their own accord under some misapprehension or else were irnpressed into the Communist ranks . We 'll give them three months of political re-education and then offer them a chance to enlist in a replacement regiment . " " And if they refuse ? " the corresponded asks . " In that case , " the general says , " we 'll hold some and probably let others return to their farms , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general follows the regimental commander indoors and the rest also enter . Maps are quickly brought out . A colonel points with the skill of long experience to areas where Communist forces are concentrated . His forefinger quickly touches three towns , each within forty miles of Nungan . At each of these three points , he says , Communist forces are grouped , waiting to attack . Two days ago , 1,000 Reds advanced within 2,000 yards of Nungan , where division headquarters are situated , and shelled a town with Japanese artillery . Their aim was poor and the shells fell on the outskirts , doing no damage . When Nationalist forces sped out of Nungan to meet them the Reds quickly retired thirty miles and now elements of their Third Division and Fourth Division ? each division numbering about 8,000 men -- are up the road , just north of Halahai . At Kaoshantun , thirty miles northeast of Nungan ; are elements of the Reds ' First Independent Division and Fifth Division . At Fulungchuan , thirty miles west of Nungan , are 1,000 Reds . There are four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Third , Fourth and Fifth , totaling perhaps 30,000 ' to 50,000 men , depending on the state of local recruiting , now being directed from the main Communist headquarters at Chienkuochi , seventy-five miles northwest of Nungan , along the southern banks of the Sungari river . Gen. Lin Piao , Communist commander in all Manchuria , was reported there a week ago , directing the new phase of Communist activities in this region . The colonel draws his fingers across the map below the Sungari from right to left . The main strength of the Communists in central and northern Manchuria , he says , has been transferred in the past two ' weeks from east of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the west . " The Communists ' aim now is to strike repeatedly along our left flank , constantly cutting the vital ' railway to prevent us from bringing up supplies for any possible future attack on Harbin as well as other communities in northern Manchuria , " - the colonel explains . " We are having a difficult time holding them off . They have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent cease fire order . They travel light , strike across country and often operate at night . They never try to stand up to us , but retire swiftly and content themselves mainly with railway and other demolitions . " We have American vehicles , brought up from the Burma campaign , but they hold us to the roads . We have little winter oil , so our motors freeze every night . It takes several hours ' work each morning to get them started again . " I ' What are your Military easu- , any averages 7 " Major Riggs asks . " They are light , " the colonel replies . - " Yesterday , for example , we had one man killed and two wounded . We are inflicting morel damage on them than they are on us because we are more heavilyi armed , but even so it is still hit and run , not bloody fighting . " An American-type field telephone rings . The colonel picks it up and remains talking for several minutes . While he speaks ' a Chinese soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory chop sticks and a bottle of baigar , a strong colorless liquid that is used widely throughout Manchuria to warm men working outdoors and as an anti-freeze in vehicles . The party eats quickly . When the colonel returns he says the forward battalions have just telephoned that an estimated 10,000 Communists , menaced by a flanking move of Nationalist forces in the east below the Sungari , are trying to escape encirclement by a forced march to the northwest and are , crossing only ' two miles north of the regimental command post . The general gives orders to repulse the Communists if they attack the Nationalist forward position but not to advance deliberately ' against them because of the cease-fire order , which is binding on all Nationalist forces in Manchuria Wide Defenses in Place The meal is quickly completed . The general rises and , followed ' by his party , makes a tour of the perimeter defenses of the town . Beyond the moat , dug centuries ago deleted 5 lines the cold wind in brown earth dugouts . Barbed wire is strung six feet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten feet everywhere around the moat . The total width of the perimeter defenses of Halahai is between thirty and seventy yards . Trees and thorny Manchurian scrub are placed across roads . Movable barbed wire road blocks are dragged aside by soldiers ' to allow the official party to pass . On the edge of the plain , hidden ' beside a low mud farm building , stand ' two well-oiled , well-pre-1 served American ' 75-mm .. guns . The gun squads come to attention on a hoarsely shouted order and then return to oiling and gun drill on a word from the division commander . Mounting . the roof of the farm building , the general , colonel and other officers peer through binoculars across the flat plain toward the north , conferring for twenty minutes . After a conference ecome hand shakes and salutes and the general , correspondent , assistant military attache and tommy gunner pile into the jeep and set out on the bumpy , frozen roads for Nungan . At half past four the sun is on the edge of the horizon . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness is all around . The wind has risen and it is colder . Shivering Chinese soldiers lit up in the glare of the jeep headlights , drag aside road blocks and open the massive creaking gates of Nungan to permit the jeep to enter . Other soldiers stand stiffly at attention when the party pulls up before the decrepit former Japanese school house that is serving as division headquarters . Inside , in the general 's narrow , dark room , lit only by candles on the ends of American ration tins , a small brick stove gives only faint heat , so those in the party keep their overcoats on . Candles flicker in the draft . When the telephone rings , the general , in a quiet , authoritative voice , reports . back to the New First Army in Changchun on the day 's activities at the front . A soldier - brings in bowls of boiling water and adds milk powder and sugar . This is dinner . The general sips slowly , holding his bowl in his left hand while with the right he grasps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps . The others sip the sugared milk and converse in low tones . As hours pass the general stays on the telephone , taking reports , giving reports to the higher command and sending instructions to his front elements . This is the war being fought today between the Nationalists and Communists in Manchuria . , Red Threat to Kirin Seen NANKING , Dec. 2 UP  --  Government reports said today that Chinese Communists had concentrated more than 500,000 troops in central Manchuria for an attack on Kirin and then on Changchun , ninety miles to the west . Communist miltary and political headquarters have been moved from Harbin to Kiamusze , the Government Central News Agency said . Kiamusze is nearly 300 miles from Changchun and 180 miles from Harbin . Crack Red troops were reported to have been shifted from Harbin to Shulan , 125 miles northeast of Changchun . Others that had been attacking Government forces in the Nungan area , north of Changchun , were said to have been withdrawn toward the Kirin sector . As Nationalist troops continued to clean up the Liaotung Peninsula of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stripping the industrial section of Dairen , the free port near the tip of the peninsula . These reports , entirely without confirmation and carried by the pro-Government press of Peiping , said the Reds were shipping the machinery to Shantung.
