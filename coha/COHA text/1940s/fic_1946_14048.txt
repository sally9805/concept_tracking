SCENE : The scene is a stage as it 's likely to appear at the beginning of a rehearsal . Some chairs are set in a semicircle to the left without much order . In the center the STAGE MANAGER has concocted a rehearsal version of a fifteenth century kitchen . A table is set at an angle to the audience , with some miscellaneous , battered chairs around it . A chair and a stool are arranged to indicate a fireplace ; two other chairs , back to back , stand for a doorway . AT RISE : As the curtain goes up the STAGE MANAGER is sitting at a smaller , rickety table downstage to the right , his manuscript and spare sides and a stop-watch before him . The ASSISTANT STAGE MANAGER , a girl , sits with him at a table . The DIRECTOR is walking up and down at the right , smoking a cigarette . HE wears a slouch hat over his eyes for protection against the lights . An ELECTRICIAN is tinkering with a rehearsal lamp down center . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rehearsal to begin . MR . ABBEY sits talking with MRS . BARNES . ABBEY is between forty and fifty , a worn but kindly man . MRS . BARNES is motherly and full of energy . CORDWELL and DOLLNER , boys of fifteen or sixteen , sit reading an old copy of Variety . FARWELL and GARDER , boys of about the same age , are bringing up chairs from the rear . In the background CHARLES ELLING , a noble-looking old fellow , is talking with JEFFSON , a dignified man of the world . p. 3 The ELECTRICIAN suddenly succeeds with the rehearsal light and everybody is blinded by it . JIMMY MASTERS ( The Director ) . What the hell 's he doing ? Do I have to have that thing there ? AL ( Stage Manager ) . If we use any other lights we have to pay an electrician . JIMMY MASTERS Then we pay an electrician ! Strike that and give us something decent overhead ! GARDER O.K. HE goes out to turn on some lights .

This is the fireplace , this is the spinning wheel , this is the outside door . The table is smaller than the one we 're going to use , and there wo n't be room for props . No dishes , for one thing . JIMMY MASTERS We 'll work out the business with the food later .  --  Does everybody know the schedule for today ? Some overhead lights come on . Oh ! Thank God ! AL Yes . They 've all been told , Mr. Masters . LONG and NOBLE come in from the left together . THEY are of military age , good-looking. p. 4 JIMMY MASTERS I 'll say it again , just in case someone did n't hear . Listen folks . HE talks both to the actors on stage and to a number unseen off to the left . We 'll begin at the beginning and go straight through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch your own cues . HE turns to the footlights . The ELECTRICIAN comes in for the rehearsal lamp , and pauses to speak to AL . KIPNER and CHAMPLAIN , both elderly , and SMITH and SHEPPARD , younger fellows , enter from the left . AL As the ELECTRICIAN goes out with the lampWe ca n't use that table . Looks like part of a set . JIMMY MASTERS Is that a ruling ? AL That 's right . JIMMY MASTERS Well , do n't argue about it . Never argue with a union . Set up with that table you 're using . While MASTERS goes on talking , AL and CORDWELL carry the table from the set out to the right . The ASSISTANT STAGE MANAGER and DOLLNER put the smaller one in its place . AL and CORDWELL return with another little table for AL and his ASSISTANT . MARY GREY enters from the left , followed by MARIE , the costumer. p. 5 JIMMY MASTERS Morning , Mary . Are we still quarrelling ? MARY GREY No , Jimmy . We 're having lunch together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel over lunch . MARY GREY And do n't cancel it again  --  JIMMY MASTERS I 've been having my troubles with the sets and lights . MARY GREY I know  --  but I have to talk to you . JIMMY MASTERS Unhappy ? MARY GREY A little . JIMMY MASTERS Oh , God . You still think I was wrong ? MARY GREY Completely wrong . JIMMY MASTERS You 're so honest , darling . I 'm not sure I like it . MARY GREY But the lunch is on ? JIMMY MASTERS The lunch is on . MARY GREY Meanwhile I shall play everything the way you want it , and little by little you 'll discover that I was right . JIMMY MASTERS Or that I was . It 's possible . MARY GREY Not likely . JIMMY MASTERS Well , let 's play it and find out . MARIE Mr. Masters  --  could Miss Grey try her costume in the first scene ? JIMMY MASTERS I 'd love to see it . In fact I 'd like to see any costume that 's ready , cast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al 's timing the scenes , so do n't stop for lines . Keep your part handy and read anything you 're not sure of .  --  There 's one thing more .  --  I do n't know whether to say this or not . Yes , I guess I will say it .  --  You probably know my theory about rehearsals . Anyway , you 've had some experience with it . My notion is that the more you kid the play and the actors and everybody concerned the better it is for all of us . If there 's anything or anybody that wo n't stand kidding , now 's the time to find it out . So I razz everyone in sight , including myself . Hank here 's been with me five times  --  JEFFSON Six . And every time the jokes get worse . JIMMY MASTERS Right . The jokes are bad , the puns are bad , and the conversation settles to a low plane where we can all be comfortable  --  and pretty soon even those of us who ca n't act , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've been running along that way for nearly three weeks , one big brainless family , no holds barred , letting ourselves go and sort of lapsing into our parts . And the method works . Even when we know what 's going on it works . We 're getting the feeling of this thing . But that 's all preparation . What we 're all waiting for and working toward is the miracle  --  the miracle that has to happen with every play that 's going to go . Some day we 'll start cold as usual , just reading lines , and then that holy fire 'll begin to play around one actor  --  and then another  --  and then around a whole scene  --  and then the spirit 'll descend on all of us at once  --  and we 'll make a new world about the size of a star and set it down on a bare stage , surrounded by kitchen chairs and mockery and bungling mechanics and directors . And afterward maybe we 'll never hit anything as good as that again , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can recall  --  and we 'll put that echo into costumes and sets and polish it up , and that 's what the first night audience will be in on .  --  Now do n't let this scare you . Do n't try for any miracle . Just go ahead and read your lines and relax , but if a miracle happens do n't let that scare you either . Take it , Al . We can start now . AL The author is n't here , Mr. Masters . JIMMY MASTERS I know it . That 's why I think we might be good today . He 's over in a hotel room re-writing a scene , thank God . Playwrights are like Indians and other enemy peoples  --  the good ones are dead . Shakespeare , Sheridan , Moliere , Synge , Sophocles  --  they 're good and dead . However , if I ca n't have a dead playwright I 'll settle for an absent one . HE starts to climb down into the auditorium. p. 6 NOBLE Could I ask one thing before we begin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day you said if actors were going to be good in a play they had to understand it . JIMMY MASTERS Right . NOBLE Well , I never think I understand a play till I know what 's the central question in it . And there are so many questions in this play I ca n't figure out which is the central one  --  JIMMY MASTERS You mean I 've been talking to you steadily for twenty-one days without touching the heart of the subject ? NOBLE Well , I would n't say that . JIMMY MASTERS If I have n't made myself clear by this time I never will and we may as well start . HE turns . No , wait a minute . When Joan was nineteen years old , after she 'd crowned her king and saved France , she was captured by her enemies and put on trial for her life . And they asked her the toughest question ever put to the human race . Why do you believe what you believe ? Remember that ? It 's in the second act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " JIMMY MASTERS That 's right . That 's the question we all have to answer . And that 's the big scene in anybody 's life , when he has to answer that question . NOBLE " Why do you believe what you believe ? " Yes , sir . JIMMY MASTERS Let 's get going . HE climbs down into the auditorium. p. 7 AL Clear the stage , please , except for those in the scene . JIMMY MASTERS Mamma d'Arc at the spinning wheel , Papa d'Arc walking up and down . AL Places , please . Act one , scene one . MASTERS disappears . The ACTORS go off to the left except MRS . BARNES , who sits at the fireplace , and ABBEY , who paces back and forth near the table . AL and his ASSISTANT sit at their table . AL presses the button on his stop watch . Curtain going up . JOAN IN HER HOME ISABELLE ROMEE ( Mrs. Barnes ) Is it full dark ? JACQUES D'ARC ( Abbey ) . Black as a chimney hole . ISABELLE ROMEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the lantern . JACQUES D'ARC The older I get the more I hate these winter nights . The dark 's so thick no honest man dares stir in it . And all night my wife lies listening for the tramp of horses , the robbers of Burgundy or England coming to run off what little they 've left us . ISABELLE ROMEE Yes . We lie awake .  --  Is there bad news today ? JACQUES D'ARC Not that I know . I was alone in the field . ISABELLE ROMEE It 's harder for the head men of a village . When things go wrong you think it 's your fault . JACQUES D'ARC Every year the English and the Burgundians draw closer , till now they 're at our own doorstep , and there 's nothing left of France but a little patch , without even a king . And it 's not a war now , only bands of robbers riding up and down , taking purses from the rich and food from the poor  --  caring nothing for which side you 're on , or which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our children  --  and what must our children think of it , looking out on all this ? It would be small wonder if a child went a little mad . ELLING ( Laxart ) enters from the wings . As HE raises his hand to the imagined door , the STAGE MANAGER raps with his knuckles on his table . D'ARC and ISABELLE look questioningly at each other. p. 8 ISABELLE ROMEE Jacques ! JACQUES D'ARC I 'll open it . HE takes an imaginary pike from the wall , steps to the door and makes a gesture of drawing it open . It 's Durand . Come in . DURAND LAXART Thank you , Jacques . HE enters . Good evening , cousin . ISABELLE ROMEE Good evening , Durand . We 're glad to see you . DURAND LAXART Then I 'm glad I came . There 's a glimmer of light at your sheep cote . ISABELLE ROMEE Yes , we have an ailing lamb . JACQUES D'ARC Is the rule relaxed about riding out at night ? DURAND LAXART No . If I were caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lantern and I met nobody . ISABELLE ROMEE I hope there 's no bad news at Burey . DURAND LAXART No . It 's been quiet . As for news , your sister Jeanne asks me to tell you that we hope to baptize a child in May . ISABELLE ROMEE I 'm glad . And we hope she 'll have good fortune . JACQUES D'ARC Yes . But HE still stands at the door , which he has closed. p. 9 DURAND LAXART Thank you .  --  I 'm not quite welcome , I know that . And that 's why I came , Isabelle . There used to be coming and going between this house and mine . I wish it could be that way again . And Jeanne wishes it . She even hoped that your Jeannette might stay with us for a week again  --  to help with the spinning , so the new babe would be sure of a nest . ISABELLE ROMEE Come and sit near the fire with us , Durand . DURAND LAXART I want to say something to Jacques first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forgiven me . But I meant no harm , and no harm came of it , you know that . Could we be friends again ? JACQUES D'ARC I think I remember saying we could not . DURAND LAXART Let me tell you how it came about . When your Jeannette came to stay with us in the spring she heard that I must go to Vaucouleurs to buy seed for the village . And nothing would do but she must go to Vaucouleurs . I gave her a bit of money , thinking she 'd want to buy something , but she had no notion of buying . No , on the road she told me that she wanted me to take her to the Lord of Baudricourt because she had a message for the Dauphin that must be delivered . I said I was only a farmer and could never approach Robert de Baudricourt . Then as it happened my village sent me a message that I must see Baudricourt to intercede about the taxes and the wheat , and I kept remembering that there was a prophecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of France . And I was perplexed about it , Jacques . For I had never expected to speak to Baudricourt , and suddenly I was charged to speak with him . ISABELLE ROMEE And you took Jeannette with you ? DURAND LAXART Yes . ISABELLE ROMEE And she spoke to Robert de Baudricourt ? DURAND LAXART Yes , a few words . ISABELLE ROMEE And he answered ? DURAND LAXART I do n't remember that he answered . He laughed at her . I think when she came before him she was the way I am with such a man . When I stand there in his presence my words clog up on my tongue . She said very little and very low , and I 'm not sure he understood what she meant . So he laughed and told me to take her home . ISABELLE ROMEE That was all ? DURAND LAXART There was no more .  --  You see , Jacques ? JACQUES D'ARC I do n't know . I  --  DURAND LAXART Well  --  I can turn and go back . ISABELLE ROMEE No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeannette has been  --  she has troubled Jacques a great deal . It 's not you he 's thinking of , but of her . DURAND LAXART Very well . HE turns. p. 10 SHE turns to LAXART . ISABELLE ROMEE Wait , Durand . I must tell him about it , Jacques . We 've kept this to ourselves . It 's more than two years since Jacques had a dream that woke him in the night , so that he woke me and told me . A dream about soldiers raiding our village , and in the dream Jeannette went away with the soldiers of one side . At first he thought she 'd been carried away , but then he saw that she went of her own will . She 's such a good and gentle girl that we thought nothing of it , but then he dreamed this same dream again and again . The third time he spoke about it at breakfast , and it happened that Jeannette was sitting near the white wall , newly limed . And when he had told the dream I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the wall behind her . Then she got up and went to the door , and we asked her what was the matter . The boys were here with us . And she said  --  first she said there might be truth in such a dream as that  --  and when we asked more about it she said , yes , it was true that she was to lead an army . Afterward she said many things like that , but it was only the talk of a child , so we still thought nothing of it . Not till she went with you to Vaucouleurs . Then we began to be afraid that our girl was a little mad  --  and it seemed that you had encouraged her in her madness . JACQUES D'ARC Bursting out p. 11 I told her that I would drown her in the River Meuse before such a thing should happen ! With my own hands ! ISABELLE ROMEE But you knew nothing of all this . DURAND LAXART No . I would n't have taken her with me if I 'd known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean ) and DOLLNER ( Pierre ) . THEY stand waiting at the door . The BOYS carry a cardboard box between them . ISABELLE ROMEE I think you should take his hand , Jacquot . MARY ( Joan ) who is wearing a patched red dress , now enters , followed by the Two BOYS . The THREE go at once to the fireplace , carrying the box and not noticing LAXART . How is the little one , Jeannette ? JOAN D'ARC I think his mother has refused him . SHE turns the box toward the fire . He 's not sick , but hungry and cold . ISABELLE ROMEE Your Uncle Durand is here . JOAN D'ARC Oh , I 'm glad . SHE rises and comes over to DURAND , giving her hand . PIERRE D'ARC Good evening , Uncle . JEAN D'ARC Good evening . DURAND LAXART How are you  --  all three ? PIERRE D'ARC I think I 'm as cold as the lamb , and as hungry , but I get no sympathy . ISABELLE ROMEE We 'll have supper in a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get plates from an imaginary cupboard. p. 12 JOAN D'ARC We must fetch some warm milk first , and try to get him to eat . It wo n't take long . JEAN D'ARC Come on . Pierre , do n't shiver . The lamb 's supposed to shiver . The three CHILDREN go toward the door . PIERRE and JEAN go out , JOAN is about to follow when her father speaks . JACQUES D'ARC Jeannette . JOAN D'ARC TurningYes , father . JACQUES D'ARC I think you know that I quarrelled with your Uncle Durand over your going to see Baudricourt . Now he has come to ask that our families be friendly again . And that you should go to Burey again to help with the spinning for the new babe . JOAN D'ARC There 's to be a new babe ? DURAND LAXART Yes . JOAN D'ARC I 'd like to go and help . JACQUES D'ARC You could go if there 's to be no more of that foolishness about Vaucouleurs or Baudricourt or the rest . If we 've heard the last of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say ? JOAN D'ARC After a pause I never want to hurt you , Father . I always want to be good , and to do right . JACQUES D'ARC Will it always be that way ? JOAN D'ARC Yes , always . JACQUES D'ARC Does that mean you wo n't try to go to Vaucouleurs from Burey ? JOAN D'ARC Low p. 13 I think I shall never again go to Vaucouleurs . JACQUES D'ARC After a pauseVery well . Go bring the milk for the lamb . JOAN goes out and into the wings . ISABELLE ROMEE You know , Jacques , it may be a good thing that she went with Durand . She came out so badly that she does n't mean to try again . DURAND LAXART It does sound that way . JACQUES D'ARC I think it 's true  --  she 's lost heart . We wo n't quarrel further about the child . HE puts out a hand . LAXART takes it and THEY go toward the table together . AL Sharply@@ ReturningHow does this door swing , Al ? I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were right . JIMMY MASTERS From in front of the footlightsWe 'll go right on , Al . Set up for the next scene . The STAGE MANAGER and his ASSISTANT begin to move the chairs to form the interior of a small sheep cote . There 's not much to it except a door , a basket upside down to sit on , and a few odd boxes . The CAST begins to emerge from the wings . MRS . KAY BARNES How was the story , Mr. Masters ? JIMMY MASTERS Getting better , Kay . It could have a bit more pace . MRS . KAY BARNES I was afraid I 'd lose them if I rushed it . JIMMY MASTERS Well , do n't do that either , of course . But just a trace faster . The whole scene was a bit lumpy and cold . You did n't exactly bring in fire from heaven , Mary . MARY GREY No , I just brought in a sheep from the stable . JIMMY MASTERS Well , that 's the idea , of course  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Now this next scene , this sheep cote  --  Almost ready , Al ? p. 15 AL Half a minute more , Mr. Masters . JIMMY MASTERS This sheep cote scene  --  and what the hell is a cote ?  --  This is probably the most difficult hurdle ever set for actors . It 's all right to say that Joan heard voices , but to show Joan on the stage listening to those voices  --  and to let the audience hear them  --  that will take some doing . It 's all got to be just right or it 'll be all wrong . We 'll have to try out the voices over and over again for sound and placing . Where 's Saint Michael ? QUIRKE EnteringHere , sir . JIMMY MASTERS Stand over in that corner of the wings , in front , and say your first line . Clear the stage , please . MISS REEVES and MISS SADLER look in . AL Clear the stage , please , unless you 're in the scene . The ACTORS go off except for MARY , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and QUIRKE , who stand to the left . JIMMY MASTERS I 'll go out front and listen . QUIRKE Right , sir . JIMMY MASTERS And try to keep that radio-announcer gravy out of your voice  --  that haliver-oil with viosterol they spread on the commercials . p. 16 QUIRKE I 'll try , sir . HE goes out . JIMMY MASTERS Go ahead . AL Are you ready , Mr. Quirke ? QUIRKE Yes . HE speaks as the saint . Jeannette ! MARY GREY Do you want to go through the scene ? JIMMY MASTERS Not yet . We 're just trying out these celestial noises . QUIRKE Jeannette ! Daughter of God , child of France ! JIMMY MASTERS My God , it 's the cascara program . No , no ! Say it , man , just say it in your own natural tone  --  do n't try to sound like an archangel . The radio 's cluttered with archangels and Gabriels . Just talk like yourself . HE mutters . If you have one . QUIRKE looks in . And stand a little further toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappears . Jeannette ! Daughter of God . Child of France . JIMMY MASTERS That 's better . That 's almost good . Keep that . Where 's Saint Catherine ? MISS REEVES Here , Mr. Masters . p. 17 JIMMY MASTERS Will you stand on the same side of the stage , but near the rear wall , and say one of your lines ? MISS REEVES Yes , surely . SHE goes off left . JIMMY MASTERS And Miss Sadler , will you stand between them , facing away from the stage ? We 'll just hear how it sounds . MISS SADLER Yes , of course . SHE goes to the left . MARY is left alone on the stage . SHE sits in her place on the up-turned basket , facing left . MISS REEVES Off-stageAnd when these things are finished let nothing deter you , for you must crown the Dauphin at Rheims . JIMMY MASTERS Look up that pronunciation , will you Al ? AL Yes , sir . MISS SADLER Off-stageBut go first to Robert de Baudricourt at Vaucouleurs , for he is nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those pronunciations , will you Al ? AL Yes , sir . JIMMY MASTERS Coming to the footlightsListen , Voices , your positions are n't right yet , but this is taking too much time , and I do n't want to stop the run-through for it . So we 'll play it where you are today . Do n't worry about how they sound , Mary . We 'll get them right . p. 18 MARY GREY I ca n't tell from here . They sound fine . AL Shall we start the scene ? QUIRKE looks in . JIMMY MASTERS Yes . Oh , St. Michael , you have n't been here before so I 'd better explain to you . She 's feeding the lamb out of that dish . She 'll finish that and then kneel to pray . That 's your cue  --  when she kneels . Only give her a few seconds to pray . QUIRKE Yes , sir . HE goes left .

If you 're properly grateful you 'll thrive and grow and live to be an old sheep . An old sheep with curly horns and a bad disposition like your father .  --  Promise me that and I 'll promise to come back this afternoon as soon as I can . Only now I must pray a little .

I always listen . SAINT MICHAEL The time grows very short , Jeannette . Your own time grows short . JOAN D'ARC I 've tried so many times , and it comes to nothing . When I try to speak the words are wrong , and when I try to do what you say , it seems  --  it seems I 'd be laughed at . SAINT MICHAEL Are you afraid of that ? JOAN D'ARC A little . SAINT CATHERINE Jeannette . JOAN D'ARC Yes . SAINT CATHERINE We have spoken to you many times . It 's more than four years since you first heard the Voice in your garden .

You are the one prophesied . p. 20 JOAN D'ARC Robert de Baudricourt only laughed . SAINT MARGARET He will not laugh at you again . JOAN D'ARC I have not even a way to go to Vaucouleurs.  --  And when I speak to de Baudricourt I blush and forget what I must tell him .

How can I find my way to these things alone ? The light disappears . I will not weep again . SHE wipes away tears . It does n't help to weep . I must think what to do by myself . SHE turns to the lamb . I must try to find my way alone . CORDWELL and DOLLNER ( Pierre and Jean d'Arc ) enter from the right and cross to the sheep cote. p. 21 PIERRE D'ARC How 's the lamb ?

JEAN D'ARC Well , the last time you went to Vaucouleurs from there . JOAN D'ARC I should be at the house . She rises , wiping away tears again . PIERRE D'ARC You should n't make her cry , Jean . JEAN D'ARC I did n't mean to . JOAN D'ARC Why did you say it ? p. 22 JEAN D'ARC What ? JOAN D'ARC About Vaucouleurs ? JEAN looks at PIERRE , who shakes his head . JEAN D'ARC We 're not supposed to tell you . JOAN D'ARC Did you talk to Uncle Durand about me ? JEAN D'ARC No . JOAN D'ARC Then it was Father . What did he say ?

JEAN D'ARC Because we were your brothers and we must protect your honor . JOAN D'ARC Would you have done it ? JEAN D'ARC Yes . JOAN D'ARC Even if God had wanted me to go ? PIERRE D'ARC Of course , if God wanted you to go you would be safe , but do you think he wanted it ? p. 23 JOAN D'ARC I do n't know how a girl from Lorraine , or anywhere , could go to war and give orders and save France .

JEAN D'ARC In high rageFor God 's sake , go home , you Duke and King of England , and if you do n't do so , I am the commander of armies , and I will do such things to you and your men  --  I will do horrible things . I will cut their heads off . PIERRE D'ARC Huh  --  that 's not done in warfare . JEAN D'ARC I 'll do it in my warfare . I 'll cut you all into small pieces , if God should wish it , I 'll  --  PIERRE D'ARC You 're a farm boy from the country , a low laborer  --  JEAN D'ARC I am a laborer and a farmer ! I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when you are all dead and cut up into sausage and we have thrown you into the fosse , it wo n't matter where I came from , you Duke of Bethfort and your baby King ! Forward , my friends ! Keep good heart ! They are frightened ! They are falling of themselves ! Strike them when they fall ! God with us ! PIERRE D'ARC We will not go away , laborer . We will fight you with our terrible hurrah ! JEAN D'ARC Then from this day expect bad fortune in France , great Duke ! HE stops to pick up an imaginary pike . Here I set up my standard . I will not budge from this ground save to go forward . p. 26 PIERRE D'ARC Now you have your fork in your hand we 'd better finish the stable . JEAN D'ARC I tell you , baby King and big-nose regent , you will do right by me and by France or you will die mean and horrible deaths ! PIERRE D'ARC Come on and help me before dinner or you 'll hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good , do n't you think ? PIERRE D'ARC You 're better'n I am , but that 's not good . JEAN D'ARC Do n't you think I 'm good , Jeannette ? JOAN D'ARC You almost make me believe  --  a boy could do it . Or a man . JEAN D'ARC No doubt about it . Give me a pike and a prophecy and I 'll talk to the Duke myself . PIERRE D'ARC Come on . JEAN D'ARC Come on , yourself ! You stand behind me and call come on ! The BOYS go out . JOAN starts after them , stops to look at the lamb , then kneels . JOAN D'ARC Oh , if I could speak large and round like a boy , and could stand that way and make my words sound out like a trumpet ,  --  if I could do that I could do all the things God wants me to do . But I 'm a girl , and my voice is a girl 's voice , and my ways are a girl 's ways . If only I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man ! But that would n't help either , for it would n't fit with the prophecy . SHE stands slowly and walks to where Jean had stood . After a moment SHE puts a hand on her hip . It will be ridiculous , it will sound foolish , but in the name of God I must try it . SHE speaks in imitation of Jean . You , you baby King of England , here without warrant from God , and you , Duke of Bethfort , who call yourself regent , go home , go back to your own country ! SHE pausesIt 's worse than I thought . It sounds wrong for a girl to say it . And yet it 's a way . It 's the only way I see . I must try it , and try it , and try again . SHE takes her stance . Sir Robert de Baudricourt , I am the maid of Lorraine , the one prophesied , and I come to you because I have a message from God for our Dauphin who should be king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it many times it may cease to be strange  --  and come easily . God help me , it 's a kind of play-acting , a thing forbidden , yet if it 's the only way it must be God 's way . SHE takes her stance again . My Dauphin , my king , I have come to you with messages from the King of Heaven . It is His will that you reign in France as His regent  --  and that Bethfort and the English be utterly defeated at my hands . And for your private ear I have more to tell you , a revelation from St. Margaret that will gladden your heart . DURAND LAXART enters and approaches the sheep-cote . JOAN bows her head in thought for a moment . LAXART comes to the door and speaks p. 27 DURAND LAXART I came to say farewell , Joan . But one week after Christmas I 'll return to fetch you to Burey . JOAN D'ARC Uncle Durand ? DURAND LAXART Yes ? JOAN D'ARC After Christmas it will be too late . I must go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till May . JOAN D'ARC I 'm not thinking of the babe , but of Orleans and the Dauphin . DURAND LAXART You must forget these things , Jeannette . I 'm allowed to have you in my house only because you promised to forget them . JOAN D'ARC I made no promise . DURAND LAXART Would you deceive your father ? JOAN D'ARC If God wishes it . DURAND LAXART I 'm sorry . I can take no part in this . I must tell him . HE turns to go . JOAN D'ARC Durand . SHE takes her stance again . Durand Laxart ! DURAND LAXART Returning , in some wonderWhat is it ? JOAN D'ARC You are only a poor peasant , Durand Laxart , and I am only a poor maiden from Lorraine , yet it is given to us two to be the first to know that Orleans will be rescued , that the armies of the English will be defeated and that France will rise again and be free . We must take this news to men far greater than any we have ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you accept this your name will be coupled with mine and never forgotten . If you refuse me your name and the name of France will be forgotten together . For I ca n't go alone . It is God who calls on us both . p. 28 DURAND LAXART You never spoke this way before . JOAN D'ARC God has taught me how to speak . DURAND LAXART Would you have me quarrel with your father ? JOAN D'ARC Would you rather quarrel with God , Durand Laxart ? DURAND LAXART God help me , girl , there 's something in your face I never saw before . Can it be that you are not mad , but see truly ? JOAN D'ARC I tell you , Durand , I carry a message from God . As surely as I stand here , I have spoken with His messengers and it is true . DURAND LAXART God help me , if I should do wrong . Your father is a hard man . JOAN D'ARC When I have saved France we shall both be forgiven . That I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the house . I 'll wait here . JOAN D'ARC I need nothing from the house . I 'll go as I am . DURAND LAXART Nothing ? And you wo n't say goodbye ? JOAN D'ARC No . They 'll come to see me  --  when I 've set Orleans free  --  when the King of Heaven has come to the aid of France . But they would hinder me now , and I have only a year . p. 29 DURAND LAXART A year ? JOAN D'ARC God gives me only one year of victory . It must not be wasted . Even an hour . Come . AL Curtain . p. 30 Act 1 , Scene 2 INTERLUDE II MASTERS comes to the footlights . MARY and ELLING return . DOLLNER and CORDWELL re-enter . AL Shall I set up for the next scene , Mr. Masters ? JIMMY MASTERS Yes . Well , fellows , this one begins to pull together . CHARLES ELLING That 's good news . I guess I thought it was better yesterday . JO CORDWELL That 's my fault . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too much in that Duke of Bedford burlesque , but I 'm not certain . We 'll have to test that before an audience . You should n't be perfect yet , you know . If you were you 'd go stale before the opening . JO CORDWELL Oh , I can do that , too . JIMMY MASTERS You wo n't . Anyway , it 's not bad to hit that Duke of Bedford stuff pretty hard . Joan has to have something to imitate . You see , she 's always been shown on the stage as a sort of Tom Paine in petticoats , a rough , mannish hoyden , with visual delusions , strong common-sense , and a rather homo predilection for soldiers ' clothes and manners . Even Shaw follows that line , but it does n't seem to be historically accurate . As far as the evidence goes she was a modest and unassuming village girl who never would have raised her voice anywhere if she had n't been convinced she was carrying out God 's orders . And if she was this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how to make herself heard , how to get her message out to the world . TESSIE enters with a note which SHE gives to MASTERS . Well , she could have picked up an idea from her brothers as well as not , and we 're supposing she did . Her own letters to the English are in this same mock-heroic style  --  and so I do n't think you 're far off the way you 're doing it now . p. 31 JO CORDWELL I see . JIMMY MASTERS Looking at the noteWhat 's this ? TESSIE It 's a message from the office . JIMMY MASTERS Damn . There goes our lunch date , Mary . MARY GREY I knew it . JIMMY MASTERS I did n't . I thought it was settled what theatre we were going to have . Now it 's not even certain we 'll have a theatre . This is really life or death for the play . MARY GREY What I wanted to talk about could be life or death for the play , too . JIMMY MASTERS How come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to discuss major revisions ? JIMMY MASTERS Yes , and it is . What 's bothering you , Mary ? We may as well have it out now . MARY GREY Well , very simply , the author 's been rewriting ever since the beginning of rehearsals . It 's almost a new play  --  JIMMY MASTERS I know it 's hard to act with new lines coming at you all the time  --  MARY GREY It 's not the new lines I 'm worried about so much  --  it 's the new meaning  --  p. 32 JIMMY MASTERS The meaning  --  ? MARIE comes in , followed by KIPNER , who wears a bishop 's mitre . MARIE Mr. Masters , you said something to the cast about trying on costumes , but do you want them to wear part of the costume , even if the rest is n't here ? I mean like Mr. Kipner ? And Miss Grey 's silver armor has come if you want her to try it on . AL enters from the left . AL I 'm sorry , Mr. Masters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door with a chunk of the cathedral scene in it , and the carpenter says you thought of using that piece in the run-through if it got here . JIMMY MASTERS That 's right  --  I forgot to tell you . AL We 'll have to put on a crew  --  or a part of a crew  --  if we use any part of a set . JIMMY MASTERS Put on a crew , then , because I want to see it . AL Roger . HE goes out left . JIMMY MASTERS Now , one thing at a time . Yes , Marie  --  I 'd like to see odds and ends of costumes whether they 're complete or not . And I 'd like to see Miss Grey in the silver armor  --  p. 33 MARIE The scarlet cloak has n't come  --  JIMMY MASTERS With or without the scarlet cloak . Is that clear ? MARIE Yes , sir . SHE goes out left with KIPNER . JIMMY MASTERS Tessie , call Howie and tell him I 'll have lunch with him and we 'll go over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rented our theatre from is now in jail , and we have to get him out or we lose our lease . They all ought to be locked up , of course , but they 're not . It only happens to us . TESSIE goes out left . And Mary , what new meaning are you talking about ? MARY GREY I do n't like to bring things up this way  --  in the middle of rehearsals  --  JIMMY MASTERS Do n't waste time apologizing  --  MARY GREY All right . Well , when I first read the play it was just the story of how Joan was told by her saints what she must do , and how she went out into the world and did her work and was tried by her enemies and executed  --  JIMMY MASTERS Yes . MARY GREY But now it 's the story of how she was told by her saints what she must do , and how she finds that she must compromise with the world , and even work with evil men , and allow evil to be done , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say it so badly  --  p. 34 JIMMY MASTERS No , you say it very well . MARY GREY But it seems to me the way the play is now it means that we all have to compromise and work with evil men  --  and that if you have a faith it will come to nothing unless you get some of the forces of evil on your side . JIMMY MASTERS That 's right . I do n't think I 'd call them the forces of evil  --  but you have to get some of the people who are running things on your side  --  and they 're pretty doubful characters mostly . MARY GREY But is that what we want to say , in a play about Joan of Arc ? JIMMY MASTERS It 's what I 'd like to hear said . And , of course you knew there was to be some re-writing . We both knew it . MARY GREY But to change what the whole play says  --  JIMMY MASTERS Changing one word can change what a play says  --  AL re-enters . MARY GREY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a desecration of Joan to treat her that way . We were talking about it last night  --  JIMMY MASTERS Who ? MARY GREY Some of the cast . We were having dinner and trying to think what was wrong  --  p. 35 JIMMY MASTERS Actors should just have dinner , Mary  --  they should n't try to think . MARY GREY But they have to think or they ca n't act ! JIMMY MASTERS Yes , I guess I did say that . Al , right after the Orleans scene , I want everybody on stage . The whole cast . AL Yes , sir . JIMMY MASTERS Clear for one-three now . AL Yes , sir . Clear the stage for thirteen , please ! Mr. Sheppard ! MARY GREY Must we have them all in on this ? JIMMY MASTERS I think they should all hear it . MARY GREY All right . SHE goes out to the right . SHEPPARD enters . AL Everybody off except those in the scene . HE and TESSIE sit at their table . JIMMY MASTERS A little more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucius Beebe and Franois Villon all rolled in one . That ought to be easy . SHEPPARD Sure  --  no trick at all . JIMMY MASTERS Loll a bit , examine your laces , take snuff  --  wait a minute , there was n't any tobacco yet , America had n't been discovered  --  but you get the idea . p. 36 SHEPPARD Not too well , but something will come out . MASTERS turns away . SHEPPARD lolls on a bench . AL Curtain going up . A POET AT THE COURT OF THE DAUPHIN JOAN enters in boy 's clothes , with JEAN DE METZ ( Farwell ) and BERTRAND DE POULENGY ( Garder ) . DE METZ The horses have to be fed , anyway . People can go without food , but horses , no . JOAN D'ARC We were to be in Chinon before nightfall , Jean de Metz . DE METZ Well , by  --  HE hesitates  --  by my saintly mother , do these girls never get tired ? JOAN D'ARC Are you tired  --  truly ? DE METZ We 've travelled three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad winter , we 've slept on more cold ground than beds , we 've eaten on an average once a day  --  and not well  --  we 've run away from Burgundians three times , and now we 've arrived  --  those are the towers of Chinon sticking up over the walls there in the sunset  --  we 've had no food today , we have n't been off our horses since noon ; and you do n't want to stop to eat . p. 37 JOAN D'ARC We could eat in Chinon . BERTRAND DE POULENGY No , Jeannette . I give you my word we ca n't . Men and horses must pause occasionally . You may be made of metal , but we 're not . We can enter Chinon in the morning . ALAN CHARTIER ( Sheppard ) rises and inspects the group surreptitiously . JOAN D'ARC ReluctantlyThen if it must be  --  BERTRAND DE POULENGY Step back of me a moment , Jeannette . JOAN does so . We meet too many curious strangers . ALAIN CHARTIER I beg your pardon , gentlemen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many miles would you say it is to that city yonder ? ALAIN CHARTIER To Chinon ? Four or five ; not more . BERTRAND DE POULENGY Does the good Dauphin still keep his court there ? ALAIN CHARTIER He does indeed . You must have come a long way . BERTRAND DE POULENGY We have . ALAIN CHARTIER The worst of it is there are no rooms in this place . DE METZ None ? p. 38 ALAIN CHARTIER Not one . They 've all been taken by citizens waiting on the road here for a sight of the virgin . DE METZ What virgin ? ALAIN CHARTIER The virgin from Lorraine who is coming this way . You have n't heard ? DE METZ No , we have n't . ALAIN CHARTIER You 'll find crowds of people along every road that leads from Lorraine to Chinon . Some twenty or thirty waited here all day  --  then at dinner time they gave up and went in to see what there was to eat . As a matter of fact , I 'm waiting for this girl myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dauphin sent me to watch out for her and smuggle her into the city by a back entrance . BERTRAND DE POULENGY The Dauphin sent you ? ALAIN CHARTIER To act as a sort of guide and friend , yes . BERTRAND DE POULENGY But is there any danger ? ALAIN CHARTIER Well , danger that she might be torn apart by the loving mob , that 's all . The Dauphin has his own private mouse-hole for going in and out of this silly city  --  and he thought perhaps the Maid would find it a bit more comfortable that way .  --  I see that you do n't believe me. p. 39 DE METZ Why do you tell us about it ? ALAIN CHARTIER Because , though I am not a prophet , my friend , I am a poet , and poets have powers of divination . You have ridden a long way , picking up the dirt of many provinces and swimming the muddy fords of many rivers . You come from Lorraine and bring the Maid with you . A pause . JOAN comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'ARC If you speak for the Dauphin you must have a sign . ALAIN CHARTIER Offering a paperThis is his seal . JOAN D'ARC What is your name ? ALAIN CHARTIER Sweeping off his hat and kneelingI am Alain Chartier , a poet and hanger-on at the court of the Illustrious Charles . He bids me greet the Maid fairly and give her welcome . JOAN D'ARC Did he say you were to kneel to me ? ALAIN CHARTIER No . JOAN D'ARC I 'd rather nobody knelt to me . ALAIN CHARTIER Then nobody will , I assure you . HE rises , dusting his knee . It 's not a position one chooses for comfort . Before we proceed further will you tell me why you wish to see the Dauphin , and upon whose authority you come ? p. 40 JOAN D'ARC Realizing that her mission begins hereI bring messages of hope and reassurance for the Dauphin from the Lord of Heaven , and if it be God 's will I hope I may see him soon , for the time is short . ALAIN CHARTIER His time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little time , so little that I can not waste nights or days or half-hours . I should be in Chinon tonight  --  ALAIN CHARTIER Then you will be .  --  In fact , it would be better if we sent for our horses and slipped away before the dinner table began to empty . JOAN D'ARC You see , Bertrand ? BERTRAND DE POULENGY Yes . The horses will have had time for a bite . I 'll get them . HE goes out . ALAIN CHARTIER The Dauphin sent no further message than I 've given , but for your satisfaction may I say that your strategy has been excellent , your timing superb and your method of approach incomparable . In the history of France I remember no name built up with such suddenness , no enthusiasm so wide-spread , no career advanced under such favorable auspices . I have not examined your entourage carefully , and therefore ca n't guess who bears the brain , but somebody of really portentous skill and imagination must have cooked this thing up . p. 41 JOAN D'ARC What thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to keep up appearances with me , you know . I 'm behind the scenes at court , and as a poet I 'm a dealer in illusions . JOAN is silent ; HE proceeds unruffled . If it 's money you want you will discover at once that the Dauphin has none . Tremoille has the money . In fact , so far as money 's concerned , you 'd have done far better on the other side . The Duke of Burgundy 's loaded with pelf . He can buy nearly anybody , and does . JOAN D'ARC To DE METZDo you know what this man means ? POULENGY reappears and waits for an entrance cue . DE METZ If I do I do n't like it . ALAIN CHARTIER Then it 's not either of you that gives orders  --  POULENGY rejoins them . BERTRAND DE POULENGY We 'll have to wait a bit . ALAIN CHARTIER Perhaps this gentleman ? I 've been saying that your success was certainly due to superior wits somewhere , and I 'd better know at once where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have set up among you may as well be acknowledged now  --  so that we 'll at least know what to conceal . p. 42 BERTRAND DE POULENGY Domestic arrangements ? ALAIN CHARTIER Who sleeps with whom , and so forth . For convenience sake let 's get such matters out of the way at once . BERTRAND DE POULENGY Sir , on the way here , since we had little money , and travelled through much Burgundian country where we dared not enter the inns , we slept mostly in the open fields . We lay down all three together , the Maid between us for warmth and protection , and one blanket above . ALAIN CHARTIER A menage a trois ? BERTRAND DE POULENGY Sir , if you mean anything against the Maid or doubt our respect for her , I advise you to watch what you say . Jean de Metz here is quick with his hands and hasty of temper , and so is Bertrand Poulengy  --  that 's myself . ALAIN CHARTIER Your pardon . What am I to think ? What am I to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lorraine . In all the time we rode together I have not had one evil thought about her  --  nor one evil impulse . DE METZ And I have not . JOAN D'ARC Your name is Alain Chartier ? ALAIN CHARTIER Yes . JOAN D'ARC Then , Messire Alain Chartier , we wo n't need you to guide us into the city  --  and we wo n't need your help to find the Dauphin . It was not the Dauphin who sent you . The Dauphin is a good and honest man , and worthy to be king . You speak as if you lived in a nest of snakes . p. 43 ALAIN CHARTIER I do . And I must say that you puzzle me . JOAN D'ARC Because we are honest ? ALAIN CHARTIER Is it possible that these are three simple folk from the farms , and all this hullabaloo grew up of itself ? JOAN D'ARC If you wish to know what is true , I can tell you very simply : God has sent me , and has sent these men so far to guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'ARC He will . ALAIN CHARTIER God help you , girl . Yes , I believe it 's true ; you come here honestly . What makes you think you can help the Dauphin ? JOAN D'ARC I have had it revealed to me . ALAIN CHARTIER In a vision , no doubt ? JOAN D'ARC In many visions . ALAIN CHARTIER You poor lost children . JOAN D'ARC We have made a long winter journey , and have come within sight of where we are going . And you say we are lost . ALAIN CHARTIER I am not a rich man , but there happens to be money in my purse at the moment . And you really go to my heart , you three . Take it , and turn back the way you came , and live happily . God knows what will become of you here . p. 44 JOAN D'ARC You speak truly . He does know . Where are these horses ? SHE turns impatiently . DE METZ They are at the trough . They have to drink . JOAN D'ARC Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And everywhere it takes so long . ALAIN CHARTIER I do n't know why I concern myself about you . If you wish to go to Chinon and pitch yourself into calamities it 's your affair . But I see now that you 're a child  --  with a child 's heart and no knowledge of the place you set your face toward . You do n't deserve what will happen to you , Maid from the frontiers . There is nothing in that court but evil . A weak ruler draws evil to him as a dead dog draws buzzards . There 's nobody left around Charles save the dead , the dying and the vultures . He 's lost nearly all his kingdom , and what 's left he 's selling , acre by acre , to pay for his cheap little pleasures . I have to live amidst what goes on there and the stench of it ruins my verses . I write bad poetry because of the lechers and usurers about me . They say you have promised to set a crown on Charles ' head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have promised it . ALAIN CHARTIER Let me tell you about his crown and his kingdom  --  a kitchen history of France  --  while they finish watering the horses . Charles ' mother Isabeau says he 's a bastard and therefore has no claim on the throne of France . She states this formally in a treaty , and the history of her amours goes far to confirm what she says . So far as I can tell Charles cares very little whether he 's a bastard or not , or who governs France  --  the French , the English , or the Burgundians  --  so long as he keeps his silly little court together and has the women he wants and enough money to stave off the tradesmen . p. 45 DE METZ Do you expect us to believe that this is our Dauphin ? ALAIN CHARTIER Well , it is your Dauphin . I live close enough to him to know . I spend most of my days and many of my nights trying to amuse him . Not that he is n't easy to amuse . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him to his face that his bad bargains with Tremoille were proof of his bastardy . No Frenchman would be so taken in . He laughed at that . I told him he had made the House of Valois a house of prostitution  --  and that it was the only house of that character that ever lost money on its transactions . He laughed at that . If he can make three sous profit on any virtue you bring him he 'll sell you out , and throw you in the corner like an empty sausage-skin . There 's no honor or decency left around him . None of any kind  --  in government , or religion  --  or the arts . Nothing but carrion flesh and the big black birds pulling at it . JOAN D'ARC Why would Charles send out to greet me if this were true ? ALAIN CHARTIER You have caused a great stir . With you he might raise an army and frighten Burgundy enough to get some money out of him . JOAN D'ARC If there is an army raised I will stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgundy will not only be threatened  --  they will be taken  --  and when once I have taken them they will not change hands again  --  p. 46 ALAIN CHARTIER They will be sold back before the capitulation is signed ! JOAN D'ARC It may be that the Dauphin has lost faith in himself and in the kingdom of France . I shall bring his faith back to him , messire , and , with the help of God , I shall bring all France back to him . Behind me , Alain Chartier , in all the towns I have passed through , men and women are talking of the rescue that I bring to France . Wherever I have been seen the Burgundians are not safe , and they know it . Wherever I have slept on the ground a whisper has gone out among the folk , and the men-at-arms go over to the Dauphin who is to be King . It is not my doing . I am a poor maid , and all I have is that I am chosen of God . That is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will be enough . You see these two men with me . They were only soldiers . They had no faith  --  but now they have . And all France will have faith . Take me to the Dauphin who is to be our King . DE METZ The horses are ready . ALAIN CHARTIER By God  --  JOAN D'ARC And do not swear . I will have no swearing in my presence . ALAIN CHARTIER Before God , then  --  you are neither charlatan nor fool . JOAN D'ARC As for the first I ca n't answer , for I do n't know what your word means . If I am a fool God at least has not held it against me. p. 47 ALAIN CHARTIER Maybe I 'm the fool  --  for there 's either a brightness on your face or something dazzles my eyes . I begin to believe  --  yes , if there were help possible for France  --  you might bring it . If somebody else were Dauphin  --  I  --  or Dunois  --  anybody  --  there might be some hope . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you do n't succeed where you are going  --  then , girl , you 're not likely to live very long afterward . JOAN D'ARC I know very well that I 'm to die . ALAIN CHARTIER You know it ? JOAN D'ARC But not before I bring hope back to France . Not until I 've taught her how to win . ALAIN CHARTIER I would never have thought it possible , but I begin to believe  --  to believe  --  God knows  --  . You bring even my wry half-faith back to me . JOAN D'ARC If you are a man of France you shall have your faith back whole ; for all France is to be ours before we are done . ALAIN CHARTIER You know , I 've never knelt to a woman for any reason except that it was the proper thing to do , but I have a strange desire to kneel to you and kiss your hand  --  because of what you have said and  --  HE kneels.  --  because  --  well , because there was mockery in my first greeting  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 JOAN D'ARC Taking her hand away I 'm dirty and weary from long travelling , and we have no time for these tricks you play at court . Take me to the Dauphin . ALAIN CHARTIER And may I see his face when he first talks with you ? AL Curtain . p. 49 Act 1 , Scene 3 INTERLUDE III MARY GREY takes Sheppard 's hand and pulls him to his feet . SHEPPARD Dusting his kneesThanks , Miss Grey .  --  You know , something went wrong with my eyes , or there was really and truly a sort of brightness on your face when I said that line . I  --  MARY GREY It comes from within , Mr. Sheppard  --  one of those patent devices , like the necktie that glows in the dark  --  SHEPPARD But truly , no joking , it was there . AL Going out leftEverybody on stage , please . The ACTORS are beginning to enter . TESSIE Going to the right . Everybody on stage , please .

Damn this Shubert furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has to be brief because we have to finish the run-through , but I 've had a little talk with Mary , and I find we 're not all pulling in harness here , and we have to find out why before we can go on .  --  Why does the fourth leg fall out of all Shubert chairs ? There 's a fundamental question .  --  Now , Mary says , quite honestly , she does n't like the way the revisions are going , and that a lot of you feel the same way . Is that true , Mr. Kipner ? p. 51 KIPNER I gather it is , Mr. Masters , though I was n't in on the discussion last night . JIMMY MASTERS Well , who was there ? LONG I was , Jimmy  --  and I guess I rather agreed with Mary .  --  Yes , I agree . JIMMY MASTERS But what was being said ? What did Mary say ? LONG Well , she said it . JIMMY MASTERS Well , Mary ? MARY GREY I see what you are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot  --  to say what I mean in front of the whole company . JIMMY MASTERS Well , maybe I am , Mary , but that 's not all of it . We have to discuss this now or not at all , and the whole company ought to hear it . And if the script 's to be changed we have to know it today . Tomorrow 's just one day too late . MARY GREY All right . I 'll say what I said last night .  --  I have always wanted to play Joan . I have studied her and read about her all my life . She has a meaning for me . She means that the great things in this world are all brought about by faith  --  that all the leaders who count are dreamers and people who see visions . The realists and the commonsense people can never begin anything . They can only do what the visionaries plan for them . The scientists can never lead unless they happen to be dreamers , too . p. 52 JIMMY MASTERS I go right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dreams . Everybody follows a gleam of some sort , and nobody can prove his gleam is n't an ignis fatuous . MARY GREY But I had another reason for wanting to do this play now . Joan 's life means to me  --  that if you die in a great cause  --  for something you believe so deeply you 're willing to die for it  --  then you 're not lost  --  your sacrifice is not lost  --  and the world can be better and different because of your dying .  --  I guess we all lost somebody in the war  --  somebody near to us that we wo n't see again . I did . And I wanted to do this play because it could mean  --  He 's not dead  --  none of them are dead who gave their lives for the world we believe in . They saved that world for us  --  and kept it for us . They are more alive than we are , for we shall never change the world much  --  but they did  --  JIMMY MASTERS Yes . MARY GREY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the way the play 's being re-written it 's in favor of compromise and getting along as well as you can with what you have . You said yesterday that no faith will bear critical inspection  --  JIMMY MASTERS Yes , I did say that  --  MARY GREY And I do n't believe it ! I do n't believe that Joan died in vain , or that those who died in the war died in vain ! p. 53 JIMMY MASTERS No  --  I do n't either . MARY GREY But does n't the play mean that now  --  does n't the coronation scene mean that , when she discovers that the Dauphin is dishonest and a fraud and allows him to be crowned anyway ? JIMMY MASTERS No . It means just the opposite . MARY GREY I wish you 'd tell me how . JIMMY MASTERS Mary , dear , the world is run by money-changers and bargainers . Sometimes a saint or a prophet comes along and gets so much influence with the people that the bargainers and politicians have to pay some attention . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They just shift their bargains enough so that the public conscience is satisfied , and get rid of the saint as fast as they can . Once in a long while there 's a saint who 's a bargainer also , like Lincoln or Roosevelt , and he plays ball with crooks and works for the common good at the same time . But nearly always the crooks are in control and the people and the men of good-will are on the outside with no power except for the fact that they can tip over the whole machine if they do n't like the way things are going . MARY GREY But what has that got to do with Joan ? JIMMY MASTERS Only this  --  that the bargainers were running the earth when she was alive  --  and they 're running the earth now . And she had to decide whether she 'd stay with that small-time crook of a king and try to make him act for the people occasionally or leave him , just as we have to decide whether we 'll keep an eye on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right now the crooks are bargaining over who 's going to own the earth  --  they 're doing it in Paris and at Hunter College and wherever two or three politicians get together  --  and a lot of people look at those politicians , dividing up empires , and say , " What 's the use ? We fought the war to stay free , and a lot of men died , and the brigands are quarreling over the loot again ! It 's no use . " And they get cynical and give up . And what I want this play to say is that we should never give up . We have to have a faith , and we have to hold those brigands to our faith  --  to world government or world peace or whatever it is . Because they 're in there making trades all the time , and we 'll never get any part of our dream except by trading for it . p. 54 MARY GREY But then why bring in Joan ? Why take the purest , simplest , most honest person that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bargaining to get things done ? JIMMY MASTERS Because it 's true . If she had n't learned to speak and then gone out into the world and argued with people and met the King and learned to deal with him  --  even learned to get along with his crooked , stupid court  --  she never would have got started . There 'd have been no country of France . MARY GREY It 's not true . I think if she 'd ever said one thing she did n't mean , or allowed one dishonest word to pass without denying it , she could n't have had any influence . Compromise is not a virtue . Once you begin to compromise you 're lost . JIMMY MASTERS We all compromise , every day of our lives . MARY GREY But a saint does n't ! That 's the difference between us and a saint ! JIMMY MASTERS Then the saint has to get somebody to do it for him . MARY GREY I simply do n't believe it , that 's all . JIMMY MASTERS What shall we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean  --  leave things the way they are ? p. 55 JIMMY MASTERS For the moment . MARY GREY Very well . JIMMY MASTERS We 'll go on , Al . AL Clear the stage for one-four , please  --  Joan at Orleans . The CAST begins to rise and go out except for WARD , who is in the Orleans scene , and MARY , who waits to speak to MASTERS . AL and TESSIE finish arranging the chairs . MARIE , the costumer , looks in . MARIE Do you wish to try the Dauphin 's robe , Mr. Ward ? LES WARD Well , I have my vanity . I could . MARIE helps him into the robe . MARY GREY You said something about wanting me to wear the silver armor . JIMMY MASTERS Right . MARY GREY Is that an order ? JIMMY MASTERS Absolutely . MARY GREY I 'll look like a table lamp from Jensen 's . JIMMY MASTERS That lights up too , you know . MARY GREY But I do n't . Not today . SHE goes out left . WARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 56 JIMMY MASTERS Ready , Al . To WARDYou 're both supposed to be asleep . You wake up first  --  just as the curtain hits the top . LES WARD I get it . AL Curtain going up . Cathedral chimes . Bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong . JOAN AT ORLEANS DAUPHIN ( Ward ) . Twelve ? HE sits up . I have an appointment at noon . AURORE ( Tessie ) . Come back and cuddle . DAUPHIN I ca n't . There are people coming here . AURORE Here ? DAUPHIN It 's only the same old stupid council . The Archbishop of Rheims and the Due de Tremoille and the Bastard . Everywhere I go I meet the same people and they all give me advice . AURORE Why do you let them ? You 're the Dauphin , are n't you ? DAUPHIN The whole trouble , Aurore , is that I 'm a reasonable man , and a man who 'll listen to reason has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasurer rush in and make me do something and then Joan and the Bastard rush in and make me take it back  --  p. 57 AURORE But how can they make you  --  ? DAUPHIN They insist . They 're not logical about it . Now I 'm logical . I know that all human decisions are based on insufficient evidence . A man never really has enough evidence even to prove that he ought to get up in the morning  --  HE gets up . AURORE Then come back . Please . DAUPHIN I ca n't  --  I  --  HE puts on his robe . AURORE I 'd better go . I 'll be in the way . DAUPHIN Not if you stay under the covers and do n't go traipsing about with nothing on . AURORE What town did we come to last night ? DAUPHIN We 're in Orleans , right in the front lines . And now that I think of it I 'm very much annoyed about being here . I never should have let them persuade me to come . It 's dangerous here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely unreasonable , as usual . AURORE Are you afraid ? DAUPHIN I afraid ? Of course not . Only a king should n't be risked in a position of danger . It 's bad strategy . Suppose I were taken ? Think of the ransom we 'd have to pay .  --  And it 's all that virgin 's fault . Tremoille keeps telling me if I do n't go about and show myself she 'll run away with all my authority  --  so  --  here I am. p. 58 AURORE She 's no virgin . DAUPHIN Oh , yes , she 's intacta . She 's been examined . AURORE Indeed ? DAUPHIN By the best possible authorities  --  a committee of jealous and suspicious women . They say she 's intacta . Also she hears prophecies and wins victories . But she 's annoying . She annoys nearly everybody . She arrogates power to herself . And we have to stop that . AURORE I think I 'll go to sleep . JEFFSON ( Tremoille ) , KIPNER ( Archbishop of Rheims ) and LONG ( Dunois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCHBISHOP wears a mitre . DAUPHIN Do you want breakfast ? AURORE No , I want to sleep . DAUPHIN So do I. HE is about to go back to bed when DUNOIS lifts his hand to the imaginary door . The STAGE MANAGER knocks on the table . I knew it . There they are . Cover your legs . Come in . HE rises . TREMOILLE , DUNOIS and the ARCHBISHOP of Rheims enter the indicated bedroom . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE I fear we disturb Your Highness . p. 59 DAUPHIN You take pleasure in disturbing my highness . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS It 's twelve o'clock , my lord . DAUPHIN I know it . DUNOIS And there 's been fighting going on since seven . DAUPHIN I thought I heard noises . Are we in any danger ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE You are indeed in grave danger . DAUPHIN I am ? I  --  myself ? HE turns to the bed . Aurore ! GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Let your cosset sleep . You are in danger , you personally . But not from the English . In danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't see how I could lose much money  --  I 'd have to have it first . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE You 'd have it if your virgin from Lorraine would fight this war with ordinary sense ! DAUPHIN What has she done ? DUNOIS She has taken three forts this morning , if you really want to know . Saint Loup , les Augustins , and Saint Jean le Blanc . DAUPHIN But that 's a victory ! DUNOIS A series of victories . p. 60 DAUPHIN But then we 're winning ! GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Victories , yes . DAUPHIN But then why are you here ? ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Because you must assert your authority over this girl . These victories will cost you heavily not only in money but in prestige also . We are truly sorry to disturb you  --  DAUPHIN Oh , I quite forgive you . I was up late , you know . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS No doubt . HE glances at the bed . AURORE squirms . DAUPHIN But what is the complaint against Joan ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she wo n't give quarter to the nobles . She wo n't take ransom money . The thought of money never occurs to her . We 're losing thousands of pounds  --  thousands ! ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS She had begun a fourth assault when we interfered  --  in your name . DUNOIS To tell the truth , we are here to warn you that there will be a terrible howl from the soldiers when they come up against that closed gate . And Joan will be angry , too . DAUPHIN What gate ? p. 61 DUNOIS The river gate . She was about to attack the Tourelles . DAUPHIN But the Tourelles ca n't be taken . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Of course not . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Sir William Glasdale boasts that he could hold the Tourelles against us for a thousand years , and I 'm inclined to think he 's right . DAUPHIN May I ask who ordered the gate closed ? Mere curiosity , of course . DUNOIS I did , Your Highness . I 'm sorry to differ with Joan , but we must attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one of that chain . The Tourelles is really impregnable till we have it flanked . DAUPHIN I agree with that entirely . That 's very sensible . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE But the heart of the matter is this , Your Highness  --  she must not make another attack without consulting you . She 's running away with your royal prerogatives . You must put yourself at the head of your troops . DAUPHIN Gentlemen , I will do anything that 's reasonable , but I will not put myself at the head of my troops . I will not fight a battle . This whole idea of fighting battles was Joan 's . It was n't mine . I do n't want to be king as much as all that . If she wants to fight battles let her fight them . p. 62 ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Step by step this girl is taking away your hereditary power . Those soldiers who stormed the forts this morning , whose followers were they , yours or the Maid 's ? DAUPHIN But that may be more my fault than hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been up I 'd still be having breakfast . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS But the Bastard was up . Were they following you or Joan ? DUNOIS They were following Joan mostly , and well they might . When she gets on that black horse in that white armor she 's something to follow . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS But it 's gone very far , Dunois . If there were a difference of opinion between Joan and our Dauphin here  --  if one went one way and the other another way  --  which would the people follow ? DAUPHIN Not me . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Then who is the ruler of France ? DUNOIS Gentlemen , gentlemen , I command the army . Joan serves under me ; I serve under Charles . He can remove either or both of us at any time . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Can he , though ? The people and the army have taken Joan as their symbol , their oriflamme . She means more to them than either of you . Try to get rid of her and there 'll be such a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never stand against it . p. 63 DAUPHIN But I 'm not thinking of getting rid of her . I 'm  --  GEORGES DE TREMOILLE If you ca n't get rid of her you can at least make use of her . At present she 's using you .  --  She must not allow her soldiers to kill enemy noblemen who could pay large ransoms . All aristocrats must be taken alive and carefully guarded . You must insist on this . If you do insist you will fill your empty treasury , and , moreover , you will re-establish your authority . DUNOIS It 's not your authority they 're concerned about , Your Highness . It 's their own . This morning she ordered that every soldier who served under her go to confession before he went into battle . And the soldiers did it . She ordered that no man should swear within her hearing  --  and they do n't . Last night she ordered that all loose women , and camp followers , be dismissed and sent home . They 're gone , too . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bundles . When has the Archbishop of Rheims converted an army ? ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS She has no right to interfere in such matters ! DUNOIS Now , we 're really getting at it ! You do n't want her around ! And Tremoille has his reason for not wanting her  --  and I 'll tell you what it is ! NOBLE ( La Hire ) walks on to the stage wearing a helmet and a sword . HE is followed by JOAN . LA HIRE raises his hand to the door and the STAGE MANAGER knocks loudly. p. 64 DAUPHIN Who 's that ? LA HIRE La Hire ! DAUPHIN You ca n't come in . We 're in council ! LA HIRE I beg your pardon . We 're coming in . HE strides in , followed by JOAN in her silver armor . Who gave that order ? DUNOIS What order ? LA HIRE Who ordered that gate shut in our faces ? DUNOIS I did . LA HIRE I thought better of you , Bastard . I thought you at least were with us . DUNOIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to show it . JOAN D'ARC Coming forwardLet me speak to them , La Hire . Forgive us , my Dauphin . Forgive our bad manners . We have come from a battlefield , where breath is short and tempers are short . I understand that you are in council . What has this council of yours decided ? DUNOIS As for me , Joan , I have decided that it would be better not to attack the Tourelles until we can surround it . As for these gentlemen , they 're afraid you 're running away with the King 's power . I 'm not with them in that . I 'm only in favor of proceeding with ordinary caution . p. 65 DAUPHIN Yes , Joan  --  in a moment of victory we must be cautious . JOAN D'ARC Gentle Dauphin , you have been with your council and I have been with mine . My Voices told me to attack the Tourelles boldly and at once . They told me to attack from three sides  --  from the river , from the city , and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion  --  the ships ; the scaffolding from the shore , the archers from the city , but now the archers have come to a closed gate . I tell you we can not pause now , and we will not . My soldiers will not be kept waiting before the gates of our city  --  closed by your orders to keep us from our battle . Look  --  look out that window ! DUNOIS and the DAUPHIN look out . The gate-keeper and his officer will be torn to pieces if that order stands . DUNOIS opens an imaginary window . There is a sound of distant shouting to the left . DUNOIS It 's true  --  they 're getting ready to break the thing down . JOAN D'ARC I ca n't hold them back ! Nobody could hold them ! I tell you God is in charge here and He wishes the Tourelles to fall ! ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS You see ? Who governs your kingdom now ? DUNOIS God , perhaps . La Hire , go to the gate-keeper , rescind the order in my name , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66 LA HIRE It 's time . Give me your seal . HE takes a ring from DUNOIS and goes . JOAN D'ARC Noticing AUROREIs this the Queen ? DAUPHIN GuiltilyNo . It 's Aurore . JOAN D'ARC Get up . Forgive me , gentle Dauphin . If you are to be a king you must act like a king . Get up . AURORE Why should I ? JOAN D'ARC Get up . I have no time to spend . DAUPHIN You 'd better get up , dear . AURORE does so . JOAN D'ARC Get your clothes and report at the gate of St. Loup . They 'll let you through . AURORE Where would I go ? JOAN D'ARC Out of this town . I have vowed that I would not leave one harlot in the city of Orleans this day . DAUPHIN But this is a little different , Joan . JOAN D'ARC I have made that vow and I find a harlot in the bed of the Dauphin who will be our king . AURORE I do n't know where I 'll go . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll tell you where to go . There have been four hundred like you through that gate . AURORE Do you let her do this ? DAUPHIN You 'd better go , dear . You see , it 's  --  she insists on it . Even the common soldiers had to send them away . AURORE I have n't had breakfast . JOAN D'ARC They 'll give you breakfast . AURORE , clutching her clothes about her , goes out . TREMOILLE , with a gesture , reminds the DAUPHIN that he must speak to JOAN . DAUPHIN I wish to issue instructions upon one point , Joan . You are not to allow any more enemy nobles to be killed . They 're to be taken prisoner and held for ransom . JOAN D'ARC My Dauphin , if they fight us they will be killed , and I will not let them go for money . I must write a letter to Sir William Glasdale , commander of the Tourelles . Who can write ? Who will write this down for me ? DAUPHIN I can write . HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is not fitting . JOAN D'ARC Do you write it then ! TREMOILLE turns away. p. 68 DAUPHIN Speak , Joan . I will set it down . JOAN D'ARC " You , Sir William Glasdale  --  and you , men of England , who have no right to be in this Kingdom of France , the King of Heaven commands you through me , Joan the Maid , to abandon your forts and go back where you belong . And if you fail to do this I will make such a hai-hai among you as will be eternally remembered . I am warning you for the third and last time . When I warned you this morning , Sir William Glasdale , you called me bitch  --  and other names which you should not have used , for you will be in the presence of God within an hour . " And now sign it , " Joan the Maid . " DAUPHIN Do n't you want to sign ? JOAN D'ARC I wish I could write but I can not . Sign it for me , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arrow and shoot it where it will come to Glasdale . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS This letter must not be sent . It is silly , boastful , illiterate , treasonous and heretical . DUNOIS Treasonous ? ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Our Dauphin has instructed her to take all noblemen prisoner . She defies him , and threatens Glasdale with death . JOAN D'ARC I must do what my Voices tell me . I can not do anything else . p. 69 DUNOIS Heretical ? ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS She goes further . She prophesies Glasdale 's death . Prophecy is sorcery , and certainly heretical . JOAN D'ARC It 's not prophecy . It 's only that  --  we shall take the bastion  --  and in the taking of it he will be killed . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS I say it 's prophecy  --  and you 've prophesied other things , too . You foretold the change in the wind . DUNOIS That 's true , Joan . And the wind changed . Not that I hold it against you . JOAN D'ARC I said the wind would change  --  and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DUNOIS I must say you spoke it like an Old Testament prophecy  --  and I believed it like one . JOAN D'ARC Would you have believed me if I 'd spoken otherwise ? DUNOIS No . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE There 's only one way to destroy such foolishness . Do you foretell that we shall take the Tourelles today ? JOAN D'ARC I know only what my Voices say . They tell me to attack today at the strongest point . And they tell me that Glasdale will be killed and many with him  --  and I think it 's today that I shall be wounded . p. 70 DUNOIS You will be wounded ? JOAN D'ARC I 've known that for a long time . But I shall recover , and we shall go on fighting , despite many who might wish otherwise . Give me the letter . SHE takes it from DUNOIS , and starts out . God wishes it to be sent , and it will be sent . Come , Bastard , I shall need you . SHE goes . DUNOIS starts to follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his reason for wishing to be rid of the Maid . What is his reason ? DUNOIS In the doorwayYesterday was pay day for the soldiers and they were not paid . Always before when they were not paid they laid down their arms and went home . In other words , our dear Tremoille used to have a veto power . He could stop a campaign at any point by withholding the money . But now they do n't give a damn whether they 're paid or not . They follow Joan . Look at them ! HE goes . DAUPHIN Did you hear that , Tremoille ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE My hearing is excellent . DAUPHIN Do you know what I 'm thinking ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE I do , but I 'd like to hear you say it . p. 71 DAUPHIN I 'll see if you know . My treasury is so deep in debt to you , my dear Duke , that I have to borrow money from you to pay interest on the money I owe you . So my debt to you gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom and my income gets smaller and smaller , and I 'm inclined to think it 's because every time I borrow from you you sell some of my territory to Burgundy to raise the money you lend me . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Nonsense . DAUPHIN It sounds like nonsense but it 's true . If we go on this way I shall end up with no kingdom at all , but you 'll have a great deal of money . You have a great deal of money now . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE It has been honestly acquired , Your Highness . DAUPHIN Oh , you 're perfectly honest . As treasurer you pocket seven-tenths of everything you take in , and I ca n't do anything about it because all your business is traffic with the enemy , and there 's no way of finding out what goes on . Everybody knows that you 're the greatest thief and the most accomplished liar in France . Otherwise you 're perfectly honest . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE You are leading up to something , I believe ? DAUPHIN Yes , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Let me tell you . p. 72 DAUPHIN Oh , you know , do you ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Certainly . It has occurred to you , as it would occur to anybody in your place , that if the Maid goes on winning your kingdom back for you the time will come when you wo n't need me . If you get two or three more rich cities you 'll be able to raise enough in taxes to pay me off . If the girl goes on beyond that and takes Paris you 'll be powerful enough to push the English out of France  --  and if you push the English out of France and I do n't have Burgundy to play off against you , well , you can eat me up and Burgundy , too . And all of us . You wo n't even have to pay your debts . A real king never does . DAUPHIN That 's exactly what I was thinking . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Of course . It 's obvious . DAUPHIN And I shall do it . GEORGES DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . DAUPHIN And why not ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Because you are counting your ortolans in the egg . You look ahead to a brilliant succession of victories for your virgin . But such things do n't happen . Joan has won three forts without the slightest attention to tactics , relying entirely on her personal prestige , the fanatic enthusiasm of her followers , and the fear she inspires in our opponents . Now , if she had stopped there and played the rest of the game cannily , watching for opportunities , she might have lasted for years . But this way she 's certain to lose sometime  --  and that 's the end of her . She 's like a gambler that doubles the stakes with every throw because he 's winning . Sooner or later the dice must fall against her . If not today , then tomorrow , if not tomorrow , then soon . But I think today . p. 73 DAUPHIN Why ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Because her luck has held about as long as luck can hold . I think she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a seer and as a general . The men will begin to grumble . They have not been paid . They have been sent to confession like children . Their women are taken from them . They 'll quit . One defeat and they 'll quit . Forget your dream of taking city after city , forget your dream of eating Burgundy and me . It will not come true . But even if Joan were to win all France for you it would not help you . DAUPHIN I think it would . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE No , because she would then eat you . DAUPHIN What do you mean ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE My lord , this girl is ambitious and unscrupulous . She intends to rule France . In your place . There is a crash in the wings to the left . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS What was that ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE They are using the cannon . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS No , but this was more like the crash of timbers . All THREE go to the window . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE She 's trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74 DAUPHIN What 's that flame in the background ? ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS They 've sent fire-boats down the river . The bridge is burning . DAUPHIN The bridge is down ! That 's what that crash was ! Oh , you wise crafty councillors , you ancient Satans , her men are fighting in the Tourelles itself !  --  While you stood here hoping for disaster she has taken it  --  she has won it ! I should be there ! I should be helping her  --  encouraging her ! ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Much help she needs from you , and much encouragement . DAUPHIN This is the end of the siege of Orleans ! They are beaten ! HE runs out . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Are we supposed to follow ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE I have no great interest in battles . There is a distant shout to the left . . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS She has won again . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE She will make an error . It will come . There was something I wanted to ask you . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Yes ? GEORGES DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the attitude of the church toward visions and prophecies among the laity ? p. 75 ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS I 'm not sure that one has been formulated . THEY go into the wings at the right . After a moment JOAN enters alone from the left . SHE carries an arrow in one hand , a kerchief in the other . Finding the room empty SHE goes to the window and looks out . There is a shout again from the left . JOAN sits on a low stool and tries to clean a blood stain from her left shoulder with the kerchief . Suddenly SHE breaks down and begins to weep . DUNOIS comes in from the left . SHE is again the little girl of the first scene . DUNOIS Joan . JOAN D'ARC Yes ? DUNOIS I shall never question your judgment again . It 's nearly over . JOAN D'ARC I know . DUNOIS How 's the shoulder ? JOAN D'ARC I do n't know . It hurts . DUNOIS Did it bleed well ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . SHE puts her kerchief to her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . JOAN D'ARC I do n't . DUNOIS Why are you crying ? p. 76 JOAN D'ARC Because they 're dead . Horribly dead . In the flaming Tourelles . In the midst of evil . And it was I that killed them . DUNOIS Killed who ? JOAN D'ARC The English . Oh , Dunois , death by fire is a horrible thing ! DUNOIS You 're crying about the English ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . I thought I wanted them dead . I said terrible things to them . But when I saw them fall blazing into that blazing water  --  then I knew  --  what I had done .  --  I ca n't do any more . I ca n't go on . Glasdale went down with all his armor . DUNOIS Naturally .  --  But do n't you see that we have won , Joan ? Do n't you see that my city is free ? You have done it ; you alone , I think . JOAN D'ARC My wound throbs awfully  --  and I have been the death of many men  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were home again . I wish I could go home . DUNOIS Why , you 're a little girl , Joan . Just a little girl . JOAN D'ARC Did n't you know it ? DUNOIS No . JOAN D'ARC The other was all put on . So they 'd respect me , and listen to me . But I ca n't do it any more . I went through so many things , because I looked forward to victory . I thought victory would be beautiful . But it 's ugly and bloody and hateful . p. 77 DUNOIS I 've never seen anything more beautiful than you as you stood on the edge of the fosse lifting your standard .  --  I happened to glance up just as you leaped , when you were calling on them to follow . When I think of victory I shall think of you as you looked then  --  The DAUPHIN bustles in , followed by LA HIRE , POULENGY and DE METZ . DAUPHIN Is she here ? DUNOIS Yes . DAUPHIN Joan  --  Joan  --  What a stroke , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I shall never cease to be grateful . I shall ennoble your family  --  Why is she crying ? DUNOIS About the dead . DAUPHIN The dead ? Oh , yes .  --  But there were n't many . DUNOIS The English dead . DAUPHIN Oh , yes , well , that was certainly a loss . All those ransoms gone . But it 's a great victory even if there 's no immediate cash in it . TREMOILLE and RHEIMS enter and stand in the rear . LA HIRE We came to be sure that you were taken care of , Joan . That was a nasty wound . JOAN D'ARC Thank you , La Hire . It will be all right . p. 78 LA HIRE And I bring you a message from the army , too . Maybe there was some doubt about you yesterday  --  or even this morning . Well  --  not now . We have the Tourelles , and Glasdale 's down under water , and you 're wounded but alive , thank God . And from now on it 's your army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've left off swearing and whoring at your word . We follow you , we follow the Maid . Pay or no pay , we stay with you .  --  And now your army wishes to see you . Will you let us carry you out to them , Dunois and I ? JOAN D'ARC Still sitting , wiping her eyesPlease , La Hire . I do n't think I can do any more . LA HIRE Some used to worry about that , too , the way you 'd burst into tears over nothing  --  over a bad name or a godon in the drink  --  but that wo n't worry us now . You 're our captain  --  and you can cry if you like  --  we follow Joan just the same . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS La Hire . LA HIRE Yes , Archbishop . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Take care of your soul if you follow that woman . She 's a sorceress . LA HIRE Turning on himTake care of your body , priest ! DUNOIS If you were not in clerical attire , my lord , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF RHEIMS I speak for the church , Captain . You are all deceived in this girl . Her visions are evil . They will bring evil to France . JOAN D'ARC What do you mean ? ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS I mean what I say ! Your visions are evil ! JOAN D'ARC RisingThen I say that you lie ! My visions are good , and they bring good to France ! They have saved Orleans today for the Dauphin , and they will set a crown on his head in your own cathedral at Rheims ! DAUPHIN My dear Archbishop , you go very far  --  ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Do you wish to be crowned by a heretic ? DAUPHIN I see no prospect of being crowned by you or Tremoille ! And you 're going to do it , are n't you , Joan ? JOAN D'ARC I have a heavy weight on my soul today . I think of the many men who died unshriven at my order  --  and I could turn gladly back to Domremy . If there are men within your own council who call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go further . DAUPHIN Then I 'll get rid of them ! To RHEIMS and TREMOILLE From now on I do n't want you in my council ! I 'll have Dunois and La Hire and Joan for my council ! Tremoille and the Archbishop are dismissed from it ! That 's an edict ! I proclaim it ! Now am I to be King ? JOAN D'ARC Defying RHEIMS and TREMOILLE p. 80 Yes , my Dauphin ! It 's been promised ! You shall be King ! DAUPHIN You see ! I do n't need you ! Leave us , you robbers  --  leave us to form our government ! GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes , my lord . You 'll wish me to turn in my accounts , no doubt ? DAUPHIN I 'll send for you when I need you ! Go ! GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes , my lord . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Yes , my lord . RHEIMS and TREMOILLE go out . DAUPHIN I wonder if I should have done that . There is a shout of soldiers off-stage to the left . . LA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have to carry you out to them . JOAN D'ARC Not yet , La Hire .  --  If you are to be King , my Dauphin , you must not keep unworthy people near you . Those two must not return . DAUPHIN I do n't want them near me . They 're not honest , you know . They 're always proposing deals . They make the most enormous sums , too , mostly out of me . JOAN D'ARC Whatever they take they take from the people of France . DAUPHIN That 's true , too . From my people . Immense sums . Fantastic . p. 81 JOAN D'ARC And if you are to be King , my Dauphin , your people must believe in you . DAUPHIN In me ? Not in you ? JOAN D'ARC In you , my Dauphin . They must believe in you . They must believe you honest , and they wo n't believe it unless you are . For the people have a strange instinct about these things . If you are n't honest , sooner or later they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worthy to be a king . DAUPHIN We 'll beat them , wo n't we ? We four will beat them , and you 'll set me on the throne and I can laugh at them all . There are books on the subject of kingship , you know . Full of wisdom . I must read them . JOAN D'ARC What you need is only faith in God . When you have that you will have faith in yourself . DAUPHIN Is that the secret ? JOAN D'ARC That 's the secret .  --  Only it 's no secret . DAUPHIN Faith in God ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . DAUPHIN I 've never had much faith in God , you know . Honestly , I have n't . JOAN D'ARC But He wants you to be King . He will set you on your throne  --  and all He asks is that you be worthy of it . p. 82 DAUPHIN I 'm not a very worthy man , really . Are you quite sure God can do anything with me ? JOAN D'ARC He has changed the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered more than half of your kingdom for you . Can He not change one human heart ? DAUPHIN That 's the question . JOAN D'ARC I have seen Him work in the hearts of many people . He will change you . DAUPHIN Well , if you say so . Come  --  I 'm willing to risk it if you are . After all , I 'm the only Dauphin there is about . Set me on the throne , and stay by me , Joan , for personally , you know , I have no visions at all . No visions and no faith . JOAN D'ARC God will send you faith . DAUPHIN You want me to be King , even if I doubt it ? JOAN D'ARC God wants you to be King . You will have faith , and you will believe in yourself , and you will govern France for Him . DAUPHIN You 're a very strange girl . I almost believe you . What worries me most is  --  we have no money . They have all the money . JOAN D'ARC We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need it we shall have it . DAUPHIN Now , if I believed that , you know  --  p. 83 JOAN D'ARC You may believe it . DAUPHIN Give me your hands , you three . THEY clasp hands . You are my council now . We shall have whatever we need ? JOAN D'ARC As soon as there is faith in your heart , you shall have whatever you need . The DAUPHIN drops their hands . . DAUPHIN I do n't know whether I want to do this . I have made some very powerful enemies . HE looks out after TREMOILLE and RHEIMSAnd if it 's all going to depend on my having faith  --  that 's a catch  --  that 's a real catch , you know . JOAN D'ARC Oh , my King , my King , put aside your fears ! Be noble as I have dreamed you to be , be as God requires you to be , be as France needs you ! Your France , your nation , your people  --  so helpless without you , but unconquerable as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at her face . Can you look at her and doubt ? DAUPHIN Looking at JOANNo . I do n't doubt it now . Give me your hands again . THEY clasp hands . AL Curtain . p. 84 Act 1 , Scene 4 INTERLUDE IV JIMMY MASTERS At the footlightsWhat time is it , Al ? AL Just one . JIMMY MASTERS We 'll break now . Back in an hour . AL Yes , sir . A piece of scenery , its wrong side to the audience , and labelled " Altar  --  Joan of Lorraine , " comes sliding on stage , pushed by FARWELL , GARDER , CORDWELL , DOLLNER , and a STAGE HAND . A number of ACTORS follow , looking on . Back at two , everybody . The ACTORS begin to drift away . FARWELL Want this thing on the marks ? AL Yes , if you do n't mind . FARWELL I 'd like to see it . During the following colloquy , the altar is swung round and placed . JIMMY MASTERS Before I go , Mary  --  MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps . It was the best you 've done . MARY GREY I thought it was better . p. 85 JIMMY MASTERS And I do n't want you to think I do n't feel the way you do about the men who died in the war . MARY GREY But you do n't . You make that very plain . I did n't want to say this before them all , Jimmy , but it does seem completely unfair to ask me to play in a play which has been re-written to say something entirely different from what it meant when I agreed to do it . JIMMY MASTERS Let 's be quite clear about this , Mary . Do you mean you might walk out on us ? MARY GREY Well , that would be unfair , too , after we 've gone so far . But I do n't know which is more unfair  --  truly I don't.  --  And the play could go back the way it was without even a rehearsal . It 's a mere matter of cutting . The whole new meaning is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . JIMMY MASTERS Leaving the play with no meaning at all . MARY GREY Leaving it with the same meaning it had when I first read it . JIMMY MASTERS Which was none at all .  --  Good God , Mary , this is no way to decide things ! MARY GREY Every play and every picture gets into this same kind of jam , and you just have to remember your first convictions and stick to them and refuse to be talked out of them or let them get lost . p. 86 JIMMY MASTERS That 's exactly what I 'm doing . MARY GREY It 's what I 'm doing . JIMMY MASTERS It 's what we 're both doing , I guess . MARY GREY Look at what this play says now , Jimmy . It says that we have to tolerate dishonesty in high places in order to get things done ! JIMMY MASTERS We do ! MARY GREY But you would n't tolerate dishonesty in your own plans ! You would n't tolerate it in the theatre ! JIMMY MASTERS My dear Mary , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . It 's frightening . You find yourself dealing with all sorts of shady operators . You heard me saying that the theatre we 're supposed to open in turns out to be rented from a man who put through a minor swindle to get the lease on it  --  and he 's in jail , and if we do n't cover a bad check of his he 'll stay there and lose his lease and we ca n't open . MARY GREY Is there no other theatre ? JIMMY MASTERS None available . MARY GREY I 'd never do it . JIMMY MASTERS You do n't have to . And I do . MARY GREY But , Jimmy , it 's like going into partnership with thieves ! It 's like buying in the black market  --  p. 87 JIMMY MASTERS We 're in that already . Every set in the New York theatre is built with black market materials . And I 'd hate to ask where some of the investors ' money came from  --  some that came in in thousand dollar bills . And did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . What is it ? JIMMY MASTERS Ice is the technical name for the private graft of the box-office men when they 're handling a hit . It 's quite usual . MARY GREY Not in  --  reputable theatres ? JIMMY MASTERS If we 're a hit we 'll probably have it in our theatre . MARY GREY But where does this end ? JIMMY MASTERS It does n't end . The world 's like that . It 's always been like that . And the theatre 's in the world , like everything else . And I still think it 's worth while to put on a play about Joan of Arc  --  in the middle of all this . The human race is a mass of corruption tempered with high ideals .  --  You ca n't sacrifice your integrity , but short of that  --  MARY GREY I will not say it ! Oh , now I see it clearly , and I will not say it ! You want the play to mean that Joan had to work with dishonest people to put a kingdom together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a play or build a world government ! And it 's not true ! It 's never been true ! You can refuse to work with thieves ! p. 88 JIMMY MASTERS You 'll touch dishonesty somewhere as soon as you start to get anything done ! MARY GREY I do n't believe it and I will not play it that way ! She was n't like that and we do n't have to be like that ! JIMMY MASTERS At the footlights , preparing to leaveI have to go , Mary . But , first , do n't you think you 're stepping outside your province a bit when you decide what the play has to say ? MARY GREY Who should decide it ? JIMMY MASTERS The author , I should think . MARY GREY You 've been giving him a good deal of advice lately . JIMMY MASTERS Anybody can advise him  --  but it 's up to him to decide . MARY GREY Then I think you should warn him that I wo n't play the lines the way they are now . The meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was clear and clean and honest and I want her shown the way she was . JIMMY MASTERS That 's all , cast . AL Take an hour for lunch everybody . Back at two . JIMMY MASTERS Is this your last word ? MARY GREY Yes , it is . An actress is held responsible for the plays she chooses , remember . And this play was different when I chose it . By this time TESSIE and the ACTORS have gone out left . AL remains marking the stage for the altar. p. 89 JIMMY MASTERS I do n't think I 'd care to produce it the way it was when you chose it . HE climbs down off the stage . I 'm not sure I 'll bother to get the fellow out of jail . Maybe I 'll just take a walk . Anyway , I 'd better get some air before I blow a fuse . Al , if I do n't come back you can take over the rehearsals . Do everything Miss Grey tells you . Let her fix the whole God damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two ! Look ! JIMMY MASTERS What is it ? AL Well , wait ! I do n't know whether I could handle this  --  JIMMY MASTERS Just ask Miss Grey . She 'll make all the necessary decisions . AL Are n't you coming back ? JIMMY MASTERS I do n't know . I 'm taking a walk . I 'll know at the end of it . HE goes on up the aisle . AL turns to Miss Grey . AL I 've never directed a play , Miss Grey . MARY GREY Neither have I. SHE sits and takes out a cigarette . TESSIE enters with three containers and three wrapped sandwiches . TESSIE Oh , Miss Grey , I brought a sandwich for you and some coffee , because you were in costume and wo n't have time to change . SHE puts the food on her table. p. 90 MARY GREY Thank you . TESSIE Do you take cream or sugar ? MARY GREY Thank you , black . TESSIE begins to unwrap her packages . No , I think I 'll go out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . MARY GREY I know . I think I will change to my street clothes . And then I will have lunch . And then I will also take a walk . And if I do not come back  --  well  --  then Mr. Masters can have it all his own way . SHE turns and goes out . TESSIE and AL look blankly at each other. @x SCENE : The stage an hour later . Two pieces of scenery have been brought in , a cathedral altar , which stands at rear center , and a section of masonry  --  with one deep-set window  --  which has been pushed back to the rear wall . When the curtain goes up the stage is in darkness except for a single spot that falls on the face of TESSIE . SHE is kneeling near the altar , pencil and notebook in hand , trying to find the light and squinting up into it . KIPNER , JEFFSON , NOBLE , LONG and ELLING are sitting to the left . AL is at the footlights , checking the lights for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so . There . I guess that 's as near as we can get it without Mary . TESSIE Calling off-stage leftMark that , Charlie ! GARDER Off-stageRight . AL Now try standing where Joan stands when they crown the king . TESSIE rises and takes the new position . And put more charm into it . TESSIE Oh , if I 'd only known you wanted charm ! SHE imitates. p. 92 AL A little to the right . TESSIE moves . Where 's that spot , Charlie ? CHARLES ELLING Off-stageIs n't that it ? No , here it is . A brilliant splash of light hits Tessie 's face . AL That does it . Have n't you got that marked ? CHARLES ELLING Off-stage Yeah , I 've got it now . AL Now where Joan stands during the trial . TESSIE She uses this stool , too . SHE picks up a stool and places it , then waits in position for the light . CORDWELL and DOLLNER enter from the left meanwhile . DOLLNER Is n't it after two ? KIPNER Masters is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLING This it ? A light comes up on TESSIE . AL Right . Now , sit down , Tessie . SHE does so . Upstage a little . SHE moves and the light finds her . MASTERS enters from the left. p. 93 JIMMY MASTERS Al ? AL Yes , Mr. Masters . JIMMY MASTERS Everybody here ? AL Miss Grey went out to lunch , and I do n't think she 's back yet , sir . TESSIE I 'll look again . SHE goes out left . MASTERS comes to the footlights . MRS . BARNES enters . AL Any luck with our theatre ? JIMMY MASTERS I do n't know yet . I did what I could . We 'll know this afternoon . AL I think there 's enough lighting sketched in for the run-through . JIMMY MASTERS What did Miss Grey say when she went out ? AL She said more or less what you said  --  if she did n't come back you could have it your own way . JIMMY MASTERS I see . Maybe we wo n't need any lighting . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what came next since I got out of the army . TESSIE returns . TESSIE No , her room 's empty . AL We could start the coronation scene . She 's not on at the beginning . JIMMY MASTERS No , we 'll wait . HE walks to the right and sits. p. 94 AL At ease , company . FARWELL , WARD and GARDER enter . LONG Could I ask a question ? JIMMY MASTERS Must you ? LONG Well , these fellows fed me three Manhattans at lunch to give me courage and they 're wearing off . JIMMY MASTERS I 'm a bit depressed . Any answers I make to questions will be depressing . LONG I do n't mind . JIMMY MASTERS Shoot . LONG Why ca n't a fellow just live by common-sense , without faith , dreams or religion ? JIMMY MASTERS What 's common sense ? LONG Oh , keeping to the right when you go down the street . GARDER Obeying the traffic laws . JEFFSON Staying away from strange women . LES WARD Saving your money . JIMMY MASTERS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of common-sense , but common-sense has nothing to do with where he 's going . You 'd never do anything , living by common-sense . Nobody lives sensibly . Let any man try to explain his motives for living the way he does . By all the rules of common-sense he 'll sound like an idiot . Why do you marry the girl you get married to ? Nobody ever explained that satisfactorily yet . DOLLNER Could n't a man live by science ? JIMMY MASTERS Hell , if you live you have to be going somewhere . You have to choose a direction . And science is completely impartial . It does n't give a damn which way you go . It can invent the atom bomb but it ca n't tell you whether to use it or not . Science is like  --  well , it 's like a flashlight in a totally dark room measuring two billion light-years across  --  and with walls that shift away from you as you go toward them . The flash can show you where your feet are on the floor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ; but as for which direction you should take in that endless room it can tell you nothing . LONG That puts you in my class , boy . Science is no better than common sense . JIMMY MASTERS It 's the same thing as far as I can see . Commonsense is yesterday 's science ; or science will be plain common-sense tomorrow . LONG But I do n't have any faith . JIMMY MASTERS Oh , yes , you do . And you live by it . Everybody has a notion of what the world 's like and what he 's like in it . My notion of what I 'm like has been giving me ulcers for years . But what you think about the world is your faith , and if you begin to doubt it you have to put something in its place quick or you 'll fall apart . A man has to have a faith , and a culture has to have one  --  and an army . An army may move on its belly , but it would n't move at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might go for an army , but not for me . JIMMY MASTERS No ? You look hard at yourself , any one of you , and you 'll find you 're living by something you ca n't explain  --  maybe a formal religion , maybe a crazy-quilt philosophy you made up for yourself out of odds and ends , maybe a cause , maybe the S.P.C.A. or the Baconian theory or Freud or scientific research or communism or Christian Science or anti-vivisection , or somebody you 're in love with , or an institution that needs cherishing  --  like our poor old theatre here on Manhattan , driven to the wall by Gresham 's Law . KIPNER What 's Gresham 's Law ? JIMMY MASTERS Cheap stuff drives good stuff off the market . KIPNER Oh . MRS . KAY BARNES What 's your religion , Mr. Masters ? JIMMY MASTERS I guess democracy . I believe in democracy , and I believe the theatre is the temple of democracy . A democratic society needs a church without a creed  --  where anybody is allowed to talk as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre is  --  though it 's sort of dwindling down to a side-chapel here , lately . What time is it ? AL Ten past two . JIMMY MASTERS Everybody here ? AL All but Miss Grey . KIPNER What did you mean when you said everybody has to have a faith but no faith will bear critical examination ? JIMMY MASTERS Just what I said . KIPNER But take your own faith  --  JIMMY MASTERS Well  --  can I prove that democracy is better than dictatorship ? Certainly not . Can I prove that the theatre is the temple of democracy ? Certainly not . I ca n't even prove that it 's a good influence . I just have faith that it is.  --  And every faith 's like that  --  every faith looks ridiculous to those who do n't have it . GARDER But if no faith will stand critical examination , does n't that leave the human race in a very doubtful position ? JIMMY MASTERS It 's always been in doubtful position . We moderns have a way of feeling very smug about poor Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her Voices and doing what they told her . But not one of us believes in anything more solid . MRS . KAY BARNES Oh , Mr. Masters ! JIMMY MASTERS We live by illusions and assumptions and concepts , every one of them as questionable as the Voices Joan heard in the garden . We take on our religions the way we fall in love , and we ca n't defend one any more than the other . MRS . KAY BARNES Oh , dear . Is this a very pessimistic play , Mr. Masters ? JIMMY MASTERS More and more men are going to realize that it 's our destiny to be in the dark and yet go forward  --  to doubt our religions and yet live by them . To know that our faith ca n't be proved and yet stick to it . Unless it 's a bad one . TESSIE But how do you know a bad faith from a good one ? JIMMY MASTERS I ca n't tell you . Nobody can tell you . But you have to know , because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who followed Hitler are held responsible , you may have noticed . LONG Those that are n't able to lie out of it . JIMMY MASTERS Yes . TESSIE But who holds us responsible ? JIMMY MASTERS We do . The human race . We hold each other responsible . TESSIE It 's a very imperfect system then . JIMMY MASTERS Very . It just barely works . It might break down altogether . NOBLE You know , Mr. Masters , I listen and listen and try my damndest  --  and to me all this does n't mean a thing . JIMMY MASTERS You 're fortunate . NOBLE But I have a faith . I have perfect faith in my director without understanding a word he says . JIMMY MASTERS Good . On the strength of that we 'll go ahead with the run-through . Ready for 21 , Al ? AL Yes , sir . You 're not going to wait for Miss Grey ? JIMMY MASTERS Right . We 're not going to wait for Miss Grey . AL Yes , sir . Ready for 21 , cast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Joan , Tessie . TESSIE Oh , my God ! All the ACTORS , except KIPNER and WARD go out. p. 95 AL Curtain going up . MASTERS climbs down off the stage . KIPNER and WARD take places near the altar . THE CORONATION AT RHEIMS ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS The Archbishop stands here , as I understand it , Your Highness , and the Dauphin kneels on this cushion to receive the unction , and the crown . Ah , here 's Tremoille . TREMOILLE enters . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE There 's a great crowd in the square in front of the cathedral . DAUPHIN Will there be many here , do you think ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE The cathedral will be full  --  and could be filled many times . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS After all , there 's been no such event in all our history . This triumphal march of yours across France , the taking of Orleans and then all the Loire cities  --  Jargeau , Beaugency , Meung , Auxerre , Troyes , Chalons , and now Rheims  --  the defeat of the English at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something really tremendous , at least in the popular mind . DAUPHIN Not really tremendous , though ? Only in the popular mind ? ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Well , of course , it 's actually made a great difference in your status . And when I 've dug a little of that dried-up consecrated oil out of the ancient chalice on the point of a golden pin , and anointed you with it , and set a crown on your head , you 'll turn on your enemies with very different prospects . DAUPHIN It runs in my head that the Maid has had a great deal to do with it . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS But remember , you 've had to restrain and guide her constantly . She receives more credit than is due her , because of your naturally generous disposition . Any other prince in your place would have got rid of her long ago . DAUPHIN Yes , of course she is a  --  a  --  GEORGES DE TREMOILLE A definite threat . DAUPHIN But useful , Tremoille , useful ! GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is whether I 've reached that point ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE As Your Highness says . Personally I believe the time has come and passed . DAUPHIN I wo n't feel I can let Joan go till I 'm rid of the Duke of Burgundy , that 's the truth . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE The Duke of Burgundy is much more afraid of you now than you of him . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Do you wish to practice kneeling once or twice , Your Highness ? DAUPHIN Perhaps I should . HE tries the cushion. p. 96 Why do you say he 's afraid of me ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE He sent a messenger last week . DAUPHIN To you ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE He wished to see you . I told him you would not negotiate . He sent another this morning . He offered you a hundred thousand gold crowns if you would make a two-weeks ' truce . DAUPHIN Getting up hastily . Did you send him away ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE No . He 's still here . Unless I 'm mistaken he has the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep him about . DAUPHIN Yes , I like the idea of having that much money in town . Has it occurred to you  --  ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes , it has  --  DAUPHIN I could  --  GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes , you could . However  --  DAUPHIN Treachery in money matters is not advisable ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE I would n't make that an absolute rule , Your Highness . But in this case  --  the positions might some time be reversed . DAUPHIN It 's a great deal of money . How much do you get ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Nothing . It seems that Burgundy wishes to deal with you directly . DAUPHIN That 's new . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes , that 's new . DAUPHIN What could we lose by two weeks ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE We should gain . It would solve a lot of problems if your treasury were full . DAUPHIN I 'll take it . Find the envoy before he leaves . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes , Your Highness . I believe , too , that if you will spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking Paris  --  there 's enough money in the wind to set a king up forever . DAUPHIN Paris ? A great deal more ? GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes . Oh , a vast amount . DAUPHIN That will bear thinking about . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes . I 'll go , Your Highness . HE turns to go . LA HIRE , DUNOIS and JOAN enter  --  TESSIE carrying her part and looking very unhappy . As THEY pass Tremoille the SOLDIERS make way for him with distaste. p. 97 DAUPHIN I think I 'll kneel with my face turned a little more toward the congregation . It 's not that I think well of my face , but I do n't want to slight the people , you see . After all , I 'm to be their King . ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Yes , my lord . DAUPHIN Ah , and here are my good military friends , the ones who have made it all possible . HE rises and gives his hand to kiss . You 're to stand near me , you know , right through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver armor . LA HIRE Your Highness . HE bows over the hand . DUNOIS Your Majesty . In turn TESSIE Kissing his handGentle Dauphin , I hope this day will prove all you could wish . DAUPHIN Indeed I think it will . The crowds are enormous . JOAN D'ARC It 's the day we fought for and waited for . MARY GREY turns to slip out and just at that moment TESSIE catches sight of her . TESSIE Oh , Miss Grey , for God 's sake do n't go ! Come and rescue me ! MARY GREY You 're doing it very well . TESSIE I 'm not doing it at all ! Oh , please ! MARY GREY I 'm not sure I 'm wanted . JIMMY MASTERS We 'd like to have you back , Mary , any time . But we did n't know whether you were coming . MARY GREY I did n't either . But after I took my walk , I  --  I decided I 'd come back and finish out the afternoon anyway . JIMMY MASTERS You 're here  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  we 'll take you on that basis . Go on with the scene , please . Let 's not waste time . AL Places , please . MARY takes Tessie 's place. p. 98 " Indeed I think it will . " DAUPHIN Indeed I think it will . The crowds are enormous . JOAN D'ARC It 's the day we fought for , and waited for . And it 's come . I think I shall be as happy today as any mortal has ever been in this world . For I shall watch the anointing and the coronation of my King .  --  So much is done that looked impossible . DUNOIS It all looked impossible . What 's left should be easy . LA HIRE Well , not easy , but we 'll do it . DUNOIS We came to one decision this morning , we of the military . We decided to strike while the iron 's hot . As soon as your crown is firm on your head we start rolling for Paris . DAUPHIN Who ? DUNOIS The army . DAUPHIN The army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new King will descend the steps to his horse , and then mount to take his place at the head of the greatest army ever led by a French sovereign . We shall strike at Paris before they can organize a resistance . And that will be the end of Burgundy , and of the English in France . DAUPHIN I 'm sorry . You 'll have to cancel those arrangements . I 'm negotiating a truce with Burgundy . LA HIRE A truce ? DAUPHIN Yes . LA HIRE And why ? DAUPHIN There has been too much bloodshed . The realm has been terribly torn . We need a little peace  --  JOAN D'ARC Burgundy needs a little peace , my King . But not you . You have all your enemies at your mercy now . It is as I have said so often before  --  we have only to go forward and Paris is ours  --  and once we have Paris they can do nothing . DAUPHIN I tell you I have decided on a fortnight 's truce with Burgundy . It 's done . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIRE It would be too late . DUNOIS They would use the two weeks to get ready for us . JOAN D'ARC You can not do this , my Dauphin . It would mean that you threw away all the advantage we have fought so hard and given so much blood to win . DAUPHIN I have done it ! JOAN D'ARC Then it must be changed ! DAUPHIN I will not change it . JOAN D'ARC We ca n't believe that you wo n't change it . We can not accept this  --  DAUPHIN I hear around me on every side that you have made me King of France  --  JOAN D'ARC No , but God has done it  --  DAUPHIN When I am King of France who will govern France ? JOAN D'ARC It is for kings to govern . You will be God 's regent here . DAUPHIN And who will tell His regent what God wishes him to do ? Will it be Joan the Maid ? DUNOIS If it were , Your Highness , you would be well advised . DAUPHIN I tell you if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause. p. 99 JOAN D'ARC And who is your adviser in this matter of the truce ? DAUPHIN I have none . LA HIRE Tremoille was here . DAUPHIN That has nothing to do with it .  --  What do you three know of the expedients to which the heads of nations must stoop ? What do you know of statecraft ? You are children in such matters . A ruler has to rob , murder , compromise , lie , cheat , steal , and enter into compacts with all sorts of brigands in order to keep going !  --  JOAN D'ARC But you did all these things before I came  --  and they did n't help ! DAUPHIN And do you think your coming has reformed the methods of government ? Men have been governed by corruption since the invention of government . They like it . They do n't want to be governed any other way ! And if you think a green girl from the country is going to change that by winning some victories you have more delusions than I thought . JOAN D'ARC Men hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know about God , but men take to it very naturally . You promised me I 'd have money when I needed it , remember ? Well , I need it very badly , and God does nothing about it . JOAN D'ARC And now I begin to wonder why God wished you to be King . DAUPHIN I wondered that myself when you first came to me , but you explained it very convincingly at the time . And now that I 'm to be made King , and practically am King , I tell you I shall do as I please . And I please to make a truce with Burgundy , and maybe I shall never march on Paris at all . Maybe I 'll decide that it 's wiser not to . DUNOIS You know how this looks , Your Highness . Like betrayal or stupidity . LA HIRE Or both . DAUPHIN I never said I was wise , I never said I was honest , I never said I was handsome . But this girl came to me and said I must be King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about .  --  I do n't think I 'm an especially good person to be King . But here I am , and the Archbishop 's waiting to crown me , and half of France is waiting outside , and I think it 's a little late to do anything about it . The crowd is heard outside . TREMOILLE enters p. 100 GEORGES DE TREMOILLE They 're about to open the doors . You 'd better take your places . How many are to stand with the King ? ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS These three . DAUPHIN Not you , Tremoille . It would n't look well . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Yes , Your Majesty . HE goes out . DUNOIS Come , Joan . The rest of us do n't matter , kings or nobles . It 's you they want to see , the Maid of France in her white armor . JOAN D'ARC If the truce is signed with Burgundy I shall never wear this armor again . I shall dedicate it to God and lay it on His altar  --  and try no more . LA HIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction . DAUPHIN If you do I 'll have the bridges burned , I 'll cut off your supplies , I 'll  --  I 'll stop you some way  --  I 'll govern my own kingdom  --  and better than you could ! HE kneels . JOAN D'ARC Why does he do this ? What has happened ? LA HIRE He has sold us out , Joan . DUNOIS Yes , he has sold us out . And we are pilloried here to look on at his crowning . Stand erect , Maid . The folk will soon be entering . We must stand erect  --  and take it . JOAN D'ARC My Dauphin , have you done this thing ? DAUPHIN What thing ? JOAN D'ARC Have you sold us out ? DAUPHIN That is not a question a sovereign should answer . JOAN D'ARC Then you have ! And you must not be King of France ! DAUPHIN But I 'm going to be ! JOAN D'ARC You say it 's too late to stop it , but it 's not too late ! I shall tell the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in this cathedral , and the people will listen to me ! The CROWD is heard again. p. 101 ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS Softly , quietly  --  The DAUPHIN rises . JOAN D'ARC I shall speak out , I say ! And when I have finished you will not dare to set the crown on his head ! ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS You have not been asked to speak ! And you wo n't speak ! We can see to that ! LA HIRE She 'll speak if she likes , my lord ! And you 'll keep quiet and listen ! I can see to that ! The army can see to it ! DAUPHIN Take care , La Hire ! This will be remembered ! By the King of France ! LA HIRE We put you here ! We keep you here ! She 's to speak to the people if she likes ! And if you do n't want her to expose you , take back whatever bargain you 've made with Burgundy and the English ! Get Tremoille back here and countermand that truce  --  only we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it ! I 'm going to be King , and I 'm going to do as I please , and if Joan does n't agree she can always leave ! It might be a very good idea for her to leave ! I will not be told what to do all the time ! It 's too late to stop my coronation  --  much too late ! It ca n't be done now ! GEORGES DE TREMOILLE Re-entering p. 102 My lord , there is a messenger here  --  one you should see , perhaps , in private . DAUPHIN Ah , ah , yes . I wonder  --  yes  --  This will only take a moment . Affairs of state . Policy . HE goes out with RHEIMS and TERMOILLE . DUNOIS Joan ? JOAN D'ARC Yes , Dunois ? DUNOIS Do n't leave him . Stay with him . JOAN D'ARC After he has betrayed us all  --  and his country  --  and even himself ? DUNOIS Yes . You see , if you speak out you may destroy him , and if you do that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no king . And if you speak out and he 's crowned anyway , and you leave him , what will France have ? A government of pure corruption . No saint , no faith , no good angel , no good influence  --  just corruption . But if you stay with him he will have to think a little of the people of France , and not always of his own bargains , for the people of France will trust you , and he will sometimes have to listen to you . JOAN D'ARC But would I be honest to stay  --  to stand here at his crowning and say nothing about what he has done ? DUNOIS Did n't your Voices tell you that you were to set the Dauphin on the throne in the cathedral at Rheims ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . DUNOIS Well  --  this is the Dauphin  --  the only one we have  --  and this is the cathedral  --  and the doors are about to be opened . You are doing what God told you to do . LA HIRE It makes a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not be wrong . This is the king He chose and He could not be wrong . And yet  --  DUNOIS Every government is made up of bargainers , Joan . That 's to be expected . Even God must be aware of that . And it 's a lucky country where the bargainers do n't have it all their own way  --  where there 's somebody like you about , making the bargainers behave . JOAN D'ARC I 've had small success so far . DUNOIS You must not give up . You must try . JOAN D'ARC I will let him be crowned . God could not be wrong . At this point MARY GREY walks down to the footlights , leaving the scene. p. 103 MARY GREY This is the part I ca n't accept , Jimmy . This is where the play goes wrong . JIMMY MASTERS I know , Mary , but let 's finish the scene . MARY GREY It 's just these few lines  --  and they could come out so easily  --  JIMMY MASTERS But let 's go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOAN D'ARC I will let him be crowned . God could not be wrong . TREMOILLE and RHEIMS re-enter , ushering in the DAUPHIN . GEORGES DE TREMOILLE When you make your entrance do not appear to be in a hurry , Your Majesty . The eyes of the people will be upon you . DAUPHIN Yes , I remember . I remember . Now  --  is the girl to stand beside me or not ? DUNOIS She will stand beside you . Come , Joan . THEY all start out. @x To MastersAll the rest I can believe  --  but I do n't see how she can decide so deliberately to give her blessing to corruption . JIMMY MASTERS The author wants it that way . MARY GREY You spoke to him about it ? AL goes out left . JIMMY MASTERS At lunch time . And it 's his own decision . Not mine . MARY GREY Oh . KIPNER , NOBLE and LONG go out left . So that settles that . Your way . JIMMY MASTERS I guess it does . He 's not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see  --  excuse me  --  but could I break in to ask something ? JIMMY MASTERS What is it , Al ? AL There 's a man named Sweeter on the phone , and he wants to know if he could attend a rehearsal tomorrow . JIMMY MASTERS Sweeter ? TESSIE enters p. 105 AL Yes . I gather he has something to do with our theatre . JIMMY MASTERS He does . He 's leasing it to us . If he likes us . AL Shall I tell him to come ? JIMMY MASTERS It 's up to Mary . I do n't mind . MARY GREY Is this the gentleman you rescued from jail ? JIMMY MASTERS It is . MARY GREY I 'm not sure there 'll be any rehearsals tomorrow . AL If you please  --  I  --  I did n't hear that  --  MARY GREY I 'm not sure there will be any more rehearsals . I 'm not sure I 'll be here tomorrow . But I 'll finish out the day . Do you want me to change for this next scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY GREY I 'll have to hurry . SHE goes out left . AL Does she mean that ? JIMMY MASTERS Yes , she means it . AL What are you going to do ? JIMMY MASTERS Proceed with the rehearsal . As usual . AL What shall we tell Sweeter ? p. 106 JIMMY MASTERS Ask if you can call him back later . Tell him we do n't know our schedule for tomorrow yet . AL And  --  we may not open at all ? JIMMY MASTERS That 's right . AL TurningGood God , what a business to be in ! Tessie , will you take the phone and give him the message ? I 've got to  --  TESSIE Sure . SHE goes out left . AL starts shifting the set for the new scene . AL CallingGive me a hand with this , will you ? GARDER EnteringAbsolutely . JIMMY MASTERS Where 's Harry ? AL He 's off today . We gave him permission , remember ? Some radio hour he could n't afford to lose . JIMMY MASTERS Oh , yes . The warmsey-woolsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any actor from a radio job . The radio holds the actors in New York and keeps ' em alive till we need ' em . The radio 's bread and butter , and anything they pick up in the theatre is just whore-money . Who 's his understudy ? AL We do n't have an understudy for the Inquisitor yet . I was hoping you 'd read it . p. 107 JIMMY MASTERS I knew it . Well , then , I want to see that pronouncing dictionary of place names . AL It 's on the table here . HE hands it down to MASTERS . JIMMY MASTERS Tomorrow we 're going through and check up on every pronunciation in the script . Some authentic Parisian is likely to come to the opening , and shoot the archbishop before he gets halfway through that list of French towns . Then there 's the River Meuse , too . I 've heard it called Merz , Maze , Mezz , Moise , and Muse  --  and my brain begins to reel when I know we 're coming to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just give up and sound ' em the way they 're spelled , either .  --  Are we ready ? AL Everything 's in position . JIMMY MASTERS What are we waiting for ? AL For Miss Grey . JIMMY MASTERS Oh . AL Clear the stage , please . SHE DEDICATES HER WHITE ARMOR JOAN , wearing the boy 's clothes as before and carrying the white armor , comes in from the left . SHE lays the armor on the altar and then kneels . JOAN D'ARC King of Heaven , I come to fulfill a vow . The truce with Burgundy is signed , we are at peace , I shall wear this white armor no more . I leave it here on your altar . We are at peace , my King , but not such a peace as we dreamed ; no , horribly , evilly in armistice , with much of the war to be fought and our enemies preparing while we dwindle here from town to town , holding court , receiving embassies , and dismissing soldiers . From town to town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King 's bidding , for he asks me to stay beside him  --  and this is the king of Your choosing , Your regent in France . We have feasted in Campiegne , Senlis and Beauvais , and we must feast in many more , if the plans hold .  --  But , O King of Heaven , the food is bitter . It is bought with money the King has accepted in payment for provinces and cities . I would rather sleep on the ground again , and chew my handful of beans , and rise to face the rank of English spears . For this way we shall lose all we have won . Even I can see that , and my Voices have said nothing .  --  If my Voices would speak again  --  if they would tell me what I should do  --  then I could sleep at night and accept what comes to me . But they have not spoken , they are silent . And I ask again and again  --  may I go into battle , or must I remain with the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days ? If my Voices do not answer , if no injunction is laid on me , then I can not stay here . I must arm again , and find the enemy , and fight as before .  --  Let my Voices speak to me if this is wrong ! Let them speak now ! I wait here alone , in the darkness and silence .  --  There is no answer . Have I been abandoned ? Have I made an error that is not forgiven ?  --  No answer still .  --  Then I must go into battle , King of Heaven . I shall find another armor , not this shining one in which I rode as Your messenger , but another , dark and humble , fitting to a common soldier . Whether I win or lose , it will be better than in these chattering rooms , trying to say something that means nothing . I think I have courage to die , but not to die thus , in small , sick ways , daily .  --  Is there a voice then ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or St. Margaret ? There is no answerThen I go to find Alencon and La Hire and Dunois . And an armor of iron  --  and the axe and sword of a soldier . Long ago my Voices told me that I would be taken prisoner . Well , when it comes I shall at least have arms in my hands . SHE rises and turns to go. p. 108 AL Curtain . p. 109 Act 2 , Scene 2 INTERLUDE II JIMMY MASTERS At the footlightsMary ? MARY GREY Yes ? JIMMY MASTERS You 'll forgive an old admirer for sort of relapsing a bit and  --  admiring you ? MARY GREY I do n't trust you , Jimmy . JIMMY MASTERS Oh , never trust an admirer . I doubt that a woman ever does . And maybe it was just because you 're goodlooking . But I liked it . HE climbs on stage . MARY GREY Do you know what I was thinking ? JIMMY MASTERS No . MARY GREY You seem to have influence with the author , and there 's a scene the play really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . Because the next time we see her she 's been taken prisoner by the English , and it 's never explained . JIMMY MASTERS That 's what the author 's working on over there now . That 's why he 's locked in the hotel room . He 's promised we 'll have it tomorrow . MARY GREY I see . Are we going right on ? JIMMY MASTERS Yes . To the first trial scene , Al . p. 110 AL Places , please . Twenty-three . ABBEY , QUIRKE , SMITH , CHAMPLAIN and MASTERS take places on the set . THE TRIAL  --  THE QUESTION CAUCHON ( Abbey ) Father Massieu , will you bring in the prisoner ? FATHER MASSIEU ( Champlain ) Surely . HE rises and goes out left . CAUCHON Before the session begins I wish to say why we are not meeting today in the Chapel Royal  --  why , indeed , the full court is not with us , and why we few assemble here in the prison to put our questions to the defendant . First , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this trial . Perhaps some of us here present misunderstood . We sit as an ecclesiastical court to examine in a case of alleged heresy , blasphemy and sorcery . But if that were our only business we should have concluded the matter long ago . It is obvious that Joan the Maid is guilty on all three counts . She has freely admitted enough heretical beliefs and actions to burn all the virgins in Europe . In my mind she is condemned and the trial is over . And yet we must go on with it . And we must be more skillful and resourceful than we have been so far or we shall be beaten . p. 111 THOMAS DE COURCELLES How is it possible that we could be beaten ? CAUCHON It would be very easy to condemn her to death at this moment and turn her over to the soldiers to be burned . But first we must discredit her . She has given the people of France a rallying cry and a cause . We must blacken her fame and destroy her name . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Masters ) I warn you then that I can take no part in such an endeavor . For myself , I am not yet satisfied of her guilt . And I shall not allow any temporal influence , whether French , English or Burgundian , to touch my judgment . CAUCHON Why , sir , I would not myself judge a case in opposition to my belief . But when it happens , as it happens now , that the just thing is the politic thing  --  when it happens that the laws of the church require of us the same verdict which is demanded of us by the heads of the state  --  is there any reason why we should not render that verdict ? INQUISITOR I shall not allow the head of any state to believe that I have pardoned or condemned at his dictation  --  or to save my own skin . CAUCHON Joan has done two things . She has put Burgundy and the English in danger . She has also put the church in danger . It happens , my dear Vicar , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers of Normandy and England is felt also by the church which you and I represent . For Joan has begun a heresy . She appeals from the church on earth to the church in Heaven . She does not recognize the necessity for an agent between the individual soul and its God . And this heresy of hers begins to affect the whole western world . p. 112 INQUISITOR My dear Bishop , if I thought a girl , one lonely , untaught girl , could come in here and set her mind and belief against the church  --  and win  --  I say she ought to win , and the church should lose . You think too little of your church . CAUCHON Then , no doubt , you will disapprove of what I have planned for today ! INQUISITOR Yes ? CAUCHON I have invited the executioner to bring in a few of his implements of torture . I have a question I wish to ask her in their presence . You disapprove , of course ? INQUISITOR No , I approve . CAUCHON Indeed ? INQUISITOR If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must do so . A sight of the rack may save her from fire on earth and fire in hell . CAUCHON Good . Then we shall have the executioner in , and he will give us a little exhibition . JOAN is led in from the left by FATHER MASSIEU , who takes her to the stool . FATHER MASSIEU You may sit if you wish . JOAN D'ARC Thank you , Father . I think I 'll stand . At first , anyway . FATHER MASSIEU As you please . HE goes to his place among the examiners. p. 113 THOMAS DE COURCELLES Who is acting as clerkDo you swear to answer truthfully to our questions ? JOAN D'ARC Taking her stance with hand on hipI will answer truly anything that pertains to this trial and which I am allowed to answer . THOMAS DE COURCELLES Are there questions which you are not allowed to answer ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . THOMAS DE COURCELLES You have been forbidden by your Voices to answer them ? JOAN D'ARC Yes , I have . THOMAS DE COURCELLES How can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all the truth ? JOAN D'ARC How can you give me a fair trial when you are all English or Burgundians , and not one churchman from loyal France among you ? I stand here among the enemies of my king , and they pretend to judge me fairly ! Why do you desire the English to be in France , when France is not their country ? INQUISITOR Let us put this matter aside . It is no part of our process  --  JOAN D'ARC It is very much a part of your process ! It is why I am here ! Because you wish to be rid of an enemy ! p. 114 INQUISITOR No , Joan . I am interested in one thing only : your soul and your relation to the mother church . I sit here not as a Burgundian , not as your enemy , but as the representative of the Inquisitor of France . If I can save you from evil , I shall save you . If I can find you innocent I shall find you so . JOAN D'ARC Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes me guilty now . CAUCHON I shall not answer that . I shall return good for evil by telling you what every prisoner wishes to know  --  news from outside his prison . Do you wish to hear it ? JOAN D'ARC If you tell it truly . CAUCHON It may sound like a fabrication , for it is all on our side , yet it 's true . Your king , the king you set on his throne , has sold Paris to the Duke of Burgundy . And he lives up to that bargain very honestly . He has broken down the bridges leading to Paris  --  and the Bastard has given up , and resigned his command and gone home . There 's your Charles the Seventh . JOAN D'ARC I will listen to nothing against my king . CAUCHON This is perhaps nothing against him , but it is also true . Your king has abandoned you . He knows that you are a prisoner here , and he has made no offer of ransom . p. 115 JOAN D'ARC I know nothing of ransoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are common among us . Talbot is still your king 's prisoner . He could have offered Talbot for you . He has not done so . He has not offered one sou . Your old friends have given you up very gaily and easily . There is no help coming  --  no hope for you save in this court . JOAN D'ARC There is no hope here . THOMAS DE COURCELLES Do you believe yourself to be in a state of grace ? JOAN D'ARC If I am not , may God put me there . If I am , may He keep me there . The MEN look at each other . FATHER MASSIEU That 's a good answer , Joan . I could not have said it so well , nor , I doubt , could your questioner , Thomas de Courcelles . CAUCHON We can do without your comments , Father Massieu.  --  Why do you insist on wearing men 's clothes , a thing forbidden to women in the rules of the church ? JOAN D'ARC You have asked that question before , Bishop of Beauvais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first because they were both more fitting and more comfortable when I rode with soldiers . I wear them now because you keep me in a man 's prison , with jailors night and day in my cell . These are evil men , and to protect myself against them I must wear men 's clothes . Give me women to attend me , give me protection against men , and I will dress as a woman . p. 116 CAUCHON We dare not leave you alone , because you attempted suicide , remember , leaping from the tower . JOAN D'ARC My prison and my guards were the same before that attempt and after  --  so that 's no reason , Bishop of Beauvais . D'ESTIVET Did your Voices tell you to leap from the tower ? JOAN D'ARC No , they did not . I leaped because I was afraid of the fire . I am still afraid of it . I would rather die in some other fashion . D'ESTIVET But you have testified that your Voices assured you you would be rescued . JOAN D'ARC Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOAN D'ARC No , I do not . They tell me only truth  --  but I do n't know what they mean by a rescue , nor do I know when it will come . THOMAS DE COURCELLES Did your Voices predict that you would be taken prisoner ? JOAN D'ARC Yes , they did . THOMAS DE COURCELLES Why did you not avoid capture if you knew it was predicted ? JOAN D'ARC If I had known the day I would not have gone out to fight that day . But they said nothing about the day or the time . p. 117 CAUCHON Have you heard your Voices since we saw you yesterday ? JOAN D'ARC Yes , I have . CAUCHON What did they tell you ? JOAN D'ARC It does n't matter . CAUCHON But it does matter . That is part of this trial . You must answer . JOAN D'ARC They woke me to warn me that the men in my cell had come near me with evil intent . And it was true . CAUCHON Did they say nothing further ? JOAN D'ARC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over again many times . This is the fiftieth time , or the hundreth , that I have come before you  --  I do n't know which . And the questions are always the same  --  and the only difference is that I grow so weary I ca n't think , and I forget what I have said before . I am chained in my cell , gentlemen . It must be by your order . My feet are chained together , and I am chained to my bed , and if I must rise for any purpose I must ask the guards to unlock the bonds . And they are there continually , the guards , day and night , planning filth , for I hear them talk and they have the minds of caterpillars  --  crawling things . What they have done , what they have tried to do , that I ca n't tell you , because it 's filth and torture . They will not let me sleep . Night after night I have no sleep , and still I must come before you to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women about me . This is not fair . It is not a trial . I come before you half mad with what I must endure in my cell  --  and without rest , without rest day or night ! p. 118 THOMAS DE COURCELLES When the warning came to you last night in your cell did it come as a voice or a vision ? JOAN D'ARC I heard it first and then saw it . THOMAS DE COURCELLES Did it touch you ? JOAN D'ARC No . WearilyMust you put these questions again ? THOMAS DE COURCELLES Have you ever touched the saints when they appeared to you ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . THOMAS DE COURCELLES In what way ? JOAN D'ARC Pass over that . I am not allowed to answer . THOMAS DE COURCELLES Do the saints have hair on their heads ? JOAN D'ARC It is good to know that they have . THOMAS DE COURCELLES Do they wear clothes ? JOAN D'ARC Is God so poor that He can not clothe His saints ? THOMAS DE COURCELLES Did they speak in French or in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not on the English side . INQUISITOR Rising impatientlyLet us trouble her no further with these petty matters . We deal here with great questions of life and death . Let me go over once more the ground of disagreement between us , and when it is clear to you perhaps you will find yourself on our side . And if that should happen you will not go to the fire . You will live . Are you too weary to listen carefully ? p. 119 JOAN D'ARC No . I will hear you out . INQUISITOR Here is the case against you . You hear voices , have visions and inspirations , which you say come from God . The church , which is God 's representative on earth , does not recognize the possibility of direct inspiration from God to His children . If you have visions we must condemn them as evil and condemn you as evil . Unless  --  unless  --  you see , there is a way out  --  unless you also condemn your visions as evil . JOAN D'ARC But I know that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JOAN D'ARC I am sure of it . I know them well . INQUISITOR You see , you have no proof . It is impossible for you to have proof . JOAN D'ARC What they led me to do was good . INQUISITOR Can you be sure that it was good ? Think of your king , and the men around him . Can you be sure ? Be truthful . There is a pause . JOAN D'ARC No . I am not sure . Rising INQUISITOR At last ! She has said it ! JOAN D'ARC Oh , ca n't you see that what I want is to do right , and not to do wrong ? Ca n't you see that this is my greater torture ? More than the torment of the guards , more than the torment of the lack of sleep , more than the threat of the fire  --  this torment of not knowing whether I am right or wrong ? My voices came to me when I was a child , and I loved them and worshipped them , and I have followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would give them up instantly if I knew they were evil ? Only I do n't know . And you have n't told me . What is all this trial for ? I wish to do right . It 's because I wish to do right that I stand out stubbornly through these sleepless nights and try to find God 's way in my thinking ! p. 120 INQUISITOR Yes , you are saved , Joan ! We shall beat the fire yet ! JOAN D'ARC But I will not be trapped ! I will not betray the truth to avoid the fire ! INQUISITOR Never ! I would as soon betray myself ! But the way is easy and clear now . You have come to the great question  --  the one that goes to the root  --  the one to which all thinking men must come  --  why do I believe what I believe ? Is n't that it ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . Then you do know . INQUISITOR I came to it myself , though not so young as you . I came to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortures you now . And I fought my way through to an answer . Do you wish to know what it was ? JOAN D'ARC With all my heart . INQUISITOR It is this ! One must believe nothing which can not be solidly proved . All hopes , all dreams , all aspirations , all imaginings , must be ruthlessly emptied out . The soul must be rinsed to the bottom of all these things  --  and must hold only to what can be proved . JOAN D'ARC But then what is there that can be proved ? INQUISITOR The doctrine and the teachings of the church . They come down in unbroken succession from the word of God . Nothing else is solid . Nothing else can be proved . Not even that we are here . Not even that the sun rises and sets . Not even that I speak to you . Not the four walls about us . Not the voices of our friends . All these could be appearance , illusions , feverish concepts . We could awake tomorrow and find that we dreamed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you trust your visions ? When the church itself , the one thing solid , has said that they are lies ? p. 121 JOAN D'ARC But if I give them up I shall be empty . All my world and my life will have no meaning . INQUISITOR Why do you believe what you believe ? Ask yourself that question again . Why do you believe your Voices ? JOAN D'ARC Because I feel that they meant good to me , and good to the world  --  because when they speak to me my heart is alive  --  like the heart of a girl in love  --  INQUISITOR Are these proofs ? JOAN D'ARC No . INQUISITOR You see , you have no answer . JOAN D'ARC And yet  --  I do feel it . INQUISITOR Still ? JOAN D'ARC Yes , I feel it still . INQUISITOR Remember that the king you set on his throne has sold Paris to us . Could God have wanted such a man to be your king ? Does n't that prove that your visions could have been evil ? JOAN D'ARC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always wanted to do right . It 's only because I wish to do right that I say my Voices are good .  --  I ca n't wrong them  --  FATHER MASSIEU Oh , Joan , Joan  --  against all of us , against reason and wisdom  --  The EXECUTIONER , wearing a mask , enters and stands at the entrance to the cell. p. 122 JOAN D'ARC I have known them so long  --  SHE looks up at the Executioner . Who is that ? CAUCHON The executioner . Come in , sir . The EXECUTIONER comes into the scene . JOAN D'ARC Why is he here ? SHE rises . CAUCHON This is the man who will put you to the fire if you persist in your heresy . But before that he will put you to the torture as a last recourse to save your soul . Show her your instruments . EXECUTIONER Taking up an imaginary boot I have many ingenious instruments , sir , but these will perhaps be sufficient . The boot and the mercy-wheel , though simply made and easily applied , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MASSIEU Yes , child . JOAN D'ARC You have heard my confession ; you know my heart ; what should I do ? FATHER MASSIEU There is only one way to save yourself . You must submit to the judgment of the church . You must renounce your visions . JOAN D'ARC And then will you let me go ? p. 123 INQUISITOR The church will forgive you . You will evade the fire . JOAN D'ARC But I will remain in prison ? INQUISITOR You will remain a prisoner . FATHER MASSIEU But save your soul , Joan . Submit yourself to the church . You are alone here . Your king has forgotten you . The noble soldiers with whom you rode to war have all forgotten you . Your visions have deceived you . They have brought no good to you or to France . You are alone and lost and condemned . But the church stands waiting still . EXECUTIONER Shall I demonstrate the operation of the wheel ? CAUCHON Wait . JOAN D'ARC What must I do ? THOMAS DE COURCELLES I have the statement ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOAN D'ARC I do n't know what is true . I do n't know what is good . Bring me a dress to wear and leave me alone in my prison . I will do as you say . I will believe no more in my visions . I will let the church decide . THOMAS DE COURCELLES It is written here that you renounce your visions and your voices , that you will wear only women 's clothes , and submit your judgment to the church . HE offers his pen and the document. p. 124 JOAN D'ARC I can only make my mark . THOMAS DE COURCELLES Yes . JOAN draws a circle . INQUISITOR It is done ! HE rises . THOMAS DE COURCELLES You have signed . Take care not to alter your decision , for the penalty is heavy . FATHER MASSIEU You are saved , Joan . HE comes over to her . The church receives you as a penitent . The MEN have all risen . JOAN D'ARC Let me go then . Let me rest . SHE turns to go . CAUCHON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joan . Be ready for us . This victory must be made known throughout Rouen , and throughout all France ! JOAN D'ARC Take me to my cell , and let me sleep . God help me , I may have done wrong , but I must rest . FATHER MASSIEU Come then . AL Curtain . THE TRIAL  --  JOAN ANSWERS JOAN D'ARC KneelingKing of Heaven , the night is over . My jailors have worn themselves out with tormenting me , and have gone to sleep . And I should sleep  --  I could sleep safely now  --  but the bishop 's questions come back to me over and over . What if I were wrong ? How do I know that my visions were good ? I stare wide awake at the dawn in the window and I can not find an answer .  --  So many things they said were true . It is true that the king we crowned at Rheims is not wise nor just nor honest . It is true that his realm is not well governed . It is true that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the King and the nobles who fought beside me . There is no word from them , no offer of ransom . And I am doubly alone , for I have denied my visions , and they will come to me no more .  --  I believe my visions to be good . I know them to be good , but I do not know how to defend them . When I am brought into a court , and must prove what I believe , how can I prove that they are good and not evil ?  --  Yes , and I ask myself whether I have been honest always , for when I went among men I acted a part . It was not only that I wore boy 's clothes .  --  I stood as my brother stood and spoke heartily as he spoke , and put my challenges in the words he would have spoken . When I spoke with my own voice nobody listened , nobody heard me , yet , was it honest to assume ways that were not my own ?  --  I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer now , after I have betrayed and denied my saints .  --  They will not burn me now because I admitted that I could not prove my voices good  --  and I submitted to the church . And now , when I am to live , when I have done what they say is right , I am more unhappy than when they said I was wrong , and must die . SHE bows her head . To the left , and partly in the wings , a light brightens. p. 125 SAINT MICHAEL Off-stageJeannette . JOAN D'ARC Yes . SAINT MICHAEL You were not wrong . You were not mistaken . Only keep true to us , and what you have done will set France free . JOAN D'ARC But the King is not a good king . SAINT MICHAEL A king is not for long . Good will come of his crowning . The French will have his kingdom . JOAN D'ARC You have spoken to me , and I denied you . SAINT MICHAEL How would you understand these things , Jeannette ? They confuse you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the church itself is built on revelations , and these revelations came out of darkness and went back into darkness like your own . JOAN D'ARC They say I can prove nothing . SAINT MICHAEL They can prove no more . In all the articles of belief and creed not one is capable of proof . SAINT CATHERINE Jeannette . JOAN D'ARC Yes . SAINT CATHERINE When you answer them speak boldly again as your brother spoke . A soul must have faith , a faith must find a voice . The voice you found has served your vision well . Resume your faith . Speak boldly as before . You were not wrong . p. 126 JOAN D'ARC But I have just signed the abjuration . If I repudiate it the penalty is swift and sure . They have told me that . SAINT MARGARET Jeannette . JOAN D'ARC Yes . SAINT MARGARET Within one year you have changed the whole face of France . If you keep your faith  --  if you hold fast to the end  --  this is only a beginning . Let them fire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set will burn down ten thousand tyrannies before it 's burnt out . It will run from kingdom to kingdom , from century to century . It is not only the French who will be set free . JOAN D'ARC Then  --  my cause is to win  --  but there 's to be no rescue for me ? SAINT MARGARET Are you afraid , daughter of France ? JOAN D'ARC I 'm afraid of the fire . Only of the fire . SAINT MARGARET If it 's too difficult , if you can not bear it , then it 's not required of you . You have done what you set out to do . You have saved Orleans and crowned the Dauphin at Rheims . You have had your year , your work is done , and they can not undo it . Make your peace with them if you must . Even so , you have done well . JOAN D'ARC Even if I continue to deny you , still I have done well ? p. 127 SAINT MARGARET Yes . They can not take from you what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was . JOAN D'ARC Forgive me if I deny you . Forgive me if I 'm not strong enough , when I see the executioner and the stake . I think I could face any other death many times , but not this once , not when I see it plain before me.  --  Listening to you , here alone with you , I can not believe that I will turn against you . But the fire has always frightened me . The fear of it rises up in me like a horror  --  and my voice says things against my will to save me . I think I will be so again . SAINT MARGARET Even so , you have done well . You have done well all you set out to do . The light begins to fade . JOAN D'ARC You are angry with me ! SAINT MARGARET How could we be angry with you , Jeannette ? In all France , in all her thousand years , there has been no child such as you . The light disappears . MASSIEU enters and crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raps on the table as MASSIEU lifts his hand to the door . FATHER MASSIEU Joan ? JOAN D'ARC RisingYes , Father Massieu. p. 128 FATHER MASSIEU May I come in ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . MASSIEU swings back the door and enters . FATHER MASSIEU Good morning , daughter . He stops in horror . You have not put on the dress ? JOAN D'ARC The guards are still in my cell . SHE points to the spot under the window where the guards are supposed to lie asleep . FATHER MASSIEU To the supposed guardsGo out . You will not be needed . HE waits for a moment while they are supposed to go . Joan , Joan , they come this morning to make sure you have kept your oath . And you have broken it . A heretic may repent and be forgiven , but a heretic who repents and then falls back into error , for such there is no forgiveness . You must change quickly , before the others arrive . This was unfair , to leave guards with you . I thought there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dress quickly . JOAN D'ARC Yes . SHE picks up the dress from the chair where it has lain . CAUCHON , the INQUISITOR , D'ESTIVET and COURCELLES enter. p. 129 FATHER MASSIEU It 's too late . They 're here . JOAN puts down the dress and turns to the door . MASSIEU opens it for the others . Come in . The FOUR enter the cell , looking first at Massieu , then at Joan . CAUCHON To COURCELLESYes  --  as I expected  --  she has not kept her word . FATHER MASSIEU You did not expect her to keep it ? CAUCHON I did not . FATHER MASSIEU Will you tell me why ? CAUCHON She meant nothing of what she said . FATHER MASSIEU She meant all that she said . She dealt honestly with us . But we have not dealt honestly with her . The guards were left in this cell last night as before . CAUCHON I made no promise about the guards . She has retained the clothes of a man . She has broken her signed abjuration . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible for her to keep her word . CAUCHON It is still true that she has not kept it . You exceed your function here , Father Massieu . You are not one of her judges . p. 130 FATHER MASSIEU I appeal to the Inquisitor  --  CAUCHON His mind is like mine in this matter . We gave her till this morning . And I am at an end of my patience with her and with this trial . She shall have her sentence , and nothing else . INQUISITOR One moment , Bishop of Beauvais . If this girl has been tricked into breaking her vow I shall not share in a sentence against her . CAUCHON Would you expect her to break it voluntarily ? Would you expect her to walk into the flames when we leave her a way out ? INQUISITOR You are not the church , my dear Bishop , and I am co-judge with you here . We gave you a dress , Joan . Why are you not wearing it ? FATHER MASSIEU I had sent the guards away . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It that true ? JOAN D'ARC Yes . INQUISITOR Then we shall leave the cell , and you may don it before the examination proceeds . HE turns . CAUCHON You wish her to escape us ? INQUISITOR Your Grace , have you not seen yet how double-edged this judgment may prove ? Do you wish to thrust greatness and an undying name upon our chief enemy ? When she is willing to put on the dress of humility , willing to pass into oblivion , willing to become nothing in the eyes of God and the Church and men ? p. 131 CAUCHON I see no such choice . INQUISITOR For the love of the church and of God we must forgive this girl , and let her be forgiven . If you have your way , if the soldiers take her and send her spirit up from the fire and cast her body to the winds , we shall never hear the last of this day 's work . The winning of a few victories  --  that could be put aside as a nine-days ' wonder . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her a martyr and a symbol  --  why then her ashes and her words will blow abroad like seeds and take root on deserts and pavements ! They will flower in heralds and prophets to spread her fame ! This will be her age , her century , and all the rest of us , priests and kings , will be minor figures in her tragedy ! CAUCHON This is fantasy , or prophecy . INQUISITOR When our history comes to be written it will show up as solid fact . There is more at hazard here than the soul of a child . CAUCHON Very well . Let her put on her dress . HE turns . FATHER MASSIEU You hear , Joan ? You 're to be forgiven . We 'll go out . JOAN D'ARC It 's not necessary . I wo n't wear it . INQUISITOR You said you were about to put it on . p. 132 JOAN D'ARC Yes . But not now . INQUISITOR This is an easy thing to do , Joan , but essential . JOAN D'ARC It wo n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voices again , and I trust them , and they are good . I 'm sorry that I denied them . FATHER MASSIEU Joan ! JOAN D'ARC It was hard to say , but now that I say it I 'm glad again , and happy . Even though it means that I must die . INQUISITOR We told you yesterday that your Voices were evil , and you had no answer . p. 133 Act 2 , Scene 3 INTERLUDE III JOAN pauses . AL prompts her . AL " I have an answer now . " MARY GREY I know the line . It 's  --  Jimmy ! JIMMY MASTERS Yes ? HE steps out of his position . MARY GREY Oh , there you are . I do have an answer now ! JIMMY MASTERS An answer ? MARY GREY Some of the new lines in this scene are Joan 's own words . I could feel them turning and living . And then suddenly I knew what she would say . JIMMY MASTERS Are you getting revelations , too ? MARY GREY Maybe . Anyway , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise in little things  --  but it 's also true that she would not compromise her belief  --  her own soul . She 'd rather step into the fire  --  and she does . JIMMY MASTERS That 's what I 've been trying to tell you  --  MARY GREY And another thing I know now  --  and it 's as if I knew it from Joan herself . It does n't matter what we try to say about her . Nobody can use her for an alien purpose . Her own meaning will always come through , and all the rest will be forgotten . p. 134 JIMMY MASTERS We 're minor figures in her tragedy ? MARY GREY Yes . SHE hugs him . I 'm sorry  --  we can go on now . What was the line ? AL " I have an answer now  --  " MARY GREY Yes . JOAN D'ARC I have an answer now . I believe in them in my heart . There is no other authority . CAUCHON Do you deny the authority of the church ? JOAN D'ARC I believe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe . CAUCHON The church has called your Voices evil . One or the other you must deny . JOAN D'ARC That 's your belief , Bishop Cauchon , but not mine . Each must believe for himself . Each soul chooses for itself . No other can choose for it . In all the world there is no authority for anyone save his own soul . INQUISITOR Then you choose death . JOAN D'ARC I know you have tried to save me . INQUISITOR I have never tried to save you . I have spoken only for the strict and correct application of the canon law . When the law is on your side , I am there also . When you set yourself against the law I must set myself against you . But I still plead with you : do not force us to abandon you . The individual soul can not choose its own faith , can not judge for itself ! p. 135 JOAN D'ARC Yet every soul chooses for itself . Who chose your faith for you ? Did n't you choose it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DE COURCELLES There 's a singular logic in this . CAUCHON I think not . JOAN D'ARC Yes , you did choose it . You choose to keep it . As I choose to keep mine . And , if I give my life for that choice , I know this too now : Every man gives his life for what he believes . Every woman gives her life for what she believes . Sometimes people believe in little or nothing , nevertheless they give up their lives to that little or nothing . One life is all we have , and we live it as we believe in living it , and then it 's gone . But to surrender what you are , and live without belief  --  that 's more terrible than dying  --  more terrible than dying young . INQUISITOR I came this morning ready to receive you back . I must now join with the Bishop of Beauvais in turning you over to the secular authorities , with the recommendation that you be gently dealt with . FATHER MASSIEU Before it 's too late , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . JOAN D'ARC To live your life without faith is more terrible than the fire . INQUISITOR The secular arm will decide the manner of death . HE turns to go. p. 136 CAUCHON However , we know pretty well what they will decide . The scaffold and the faggots are ready in the square . HE turns . THOMAS DE COURCELLES What shall I write ? THEY pause , waiting for Joan . SHE is silent . CAUCHON Write that she has relapsed , and that we abandon her . D'ESTIVET Shall I call the cell guards ? CAUCHON No . The executioner will take care of the rest . One by one the examiners go , leaving FATHER MASSIEU . FATHER MASSIEU I did all I could . JOAN D'ARC I know . And I thank you , Father Massieu . FATHER MASSIEU And I will see you again . JOAN D'ARC When they take me to the  --  to the place  --  please be with me then . I shall need you . FATHER MASSIEU Yes , I know . JOAN D'ARC If it 's today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that . JOAN D'ARC Today ? FATHER MASSIEU Yes . p. 137 JOAN D'ARC Must you leave me now ? FATHER MASSIEU We are all summoned to a conference . I will see you afterward . JOAN D'ARC In the square ? FATHER MASSIEU I think so , Joan . I fear it . I must go now . JOAN D'ARC Yes , I know . MASSIEU goes out . How sharply I see  --  how different everything looks  --  now that I know I 'm to die ! The window  --  and the dim cell  --  and the black dress . SHE picks up the dress . I wanted a black dress when I left Domremy , but I had to wear that old , red patched one .  --  It seems so long ago . I wonder where my father and mother are . The taxes are remitted on the town of Domremy . Remitted forever , it 's said . And I 'm to die today . I must face it and play it out . I must stand proudly and speak well . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end . I can depend on them as on Father Massieu.  --  And if it were to do over , I would do it again . I would follow my faith , even to the fire . It can not take long to die . It will be a little pain , and then it will end , and then I wo n't know . No , the pain will not be little  --  but it will end  --  and up to the end my Voices will speak to me . The EXECUTIONER comes in from the left , swings back the door and enters p. 138 EXECUTIONER You are to come with me . JOAN D'ARC Is it to happen now ? EXECUTIONER Yes . Put your hands behind your back . You 're to be manacled . JOAN D'ARC ObeyingI shall not give you any trouble . EXECUTIONER But your hands must be bound . HE seems to bind them . Now walk before me . JOAN D'ARC Turning to the door                @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
