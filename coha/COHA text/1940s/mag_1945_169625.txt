They had been married ten years . Big , slow-moving Albert and his neat , pretty wife Josie-Lee , seldom escaped the dawn-to-dark drudgery of farm life . They made little money . But few U.S. couples were happier . They had 52 acres ot land near Memphis , a white cottage , a little herd of dairy cattle . They had four children-a baby girl and three little boys . Both had been raised on the land , both were from plain , churchgoing Methodist families and neither had ever expected life to be different . <P> Then , when Albert was 40 and Josie-Lee 32 , the U.S. went to war . They packed up and went to Memphis , Albert to work in a tire factory , Josie-Lee to a job in an aircraft plant . In two years they saved $3,000 . But they lived in a squalid water front boarding house , saw little of each other or their children . <P> There were strains and irritations in their new life . Albert , who had never touched liquor , began coming home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half their savings on a car . Then he took up with an 18-year-old girl war-worker . Josie-Lee went to the tire plant , where she fought her rival with fists and fingernails . She won , but Albert , who had watched , simply walked away with the weeping loser . <P> Terrified , Josie-Lee went to the other woman again , to plead for her husband . Said the girl : " He 's anybody 's prey . If I get him , I 'll keep him . " As stonily , Albert said : " I 've worked all my life . It 's time I was enjoying myself . " He asked Josie-Lee to divorce him . At last she agreed . Last week she was back on the farm with the children . Albert had married the girl , lost his war job , headed somewhere away from Tennessee . <P> Young and Middle-Aged . With variations major and minor , the same bathetic , woeful , touching story was being enacted last week by thousands of other U.S. husbands &; wives . Like Albert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most had been happy before the war . But they had not withstood loneliness or temptation or big money , or the contagious recklessness of the times . <P> Despite a Supreme Court decision ( TiME , June 4 ) which made quick divorce suspect in other states , Reno was booming - its hotels were jammed , workmen were building a $106,000 addition to the Washoe County Courthouse , and the divorce business was almost triple the mark of booming 1940 . But Reno , and divorce mills like Miami and Hot Springs , Ark. , no longer had a corner on the quick-divorce market . People were buying divorces every where almost as matter-of-factly as they had bought moonshine in the ' 20s . The U.S. divorce rate had virtually doubled since Pearl Harbor . <P> For Those with Children . In Chicago , Judge Edwin A. Robson had installed a nursery just off his court . As parents stood before the bench last week ( few Chicago bailiffs wasted time asking them to take the witness stand ) , their children looked at comic books or played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real victims . Thousands of them would learn to accept the impermanence of their parents ' marriages as natural and matter-of-fact . Instead of having two parents they would now have one - or three , or four ; they would learn to be visitors in one or both of their two " homes . " Brothers &; sisters would be divided . And many a child would lack actual care , suffer indifference or antagonism.
