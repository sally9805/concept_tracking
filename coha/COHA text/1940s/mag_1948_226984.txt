One day last week the second biggest teachers ' strike in U.S. history+ " broke out in Minneapolis - 92 schools shut down and 64,000 schoolkids on the loose . The next day Minneapolis School Superintendent Willard Goslin boarded a plane for Atlantic City . There he was inducted as pres ident of the Association of School Administrators , the No. 1 honor open to any U.S. school superintendent . <P> At first glance , the two events did n't seem to go together . But no one blamed Goslin for the strike . The union teachers ( 1,100 out of 2,200 ) were striking against a law he did n't like either , but could not change by himself : a tax ceiling that had left Minneapolis schools $2 million shy of 1948 needs . <P> Under the circumstances , confessed Mayor Hubert Humphrey : " Minneapolis is powerless to meet the financial requirements of providing decent education for its children . " On March 24 , Minneapolis would vote on a new charter-providing $4 million more school revenues a year . But the Teachers ' Federations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves : movie attendance jumped 50% , " every day was like Saturday " at the public library , and there were just too many kids underfoot . <P> Lanky , folksy Superintendent Goslin , who grew up on a Missouri farm and thinks that too much of education goes on in a classroom , did n't feel quite as desperate as most Minneapolis parents . Just before - he boarded the plane for Atlantic City last week , Goslin told his 15-year-old daughter to buy a sewing machine . The schools might be idle , but his " gosling " would n't be . <P> + Bigger : Buffalo 's a year ago .
