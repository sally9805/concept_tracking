Letters to The Times Student Exchange Suggested Scholarship Plan to Embrace as Many Nations as Desired Recommended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : To the interested and often worried observer of events , particularly in the recent past , comes the recurring thought that much of the trouble and disorder confronting us today is due to a deficient understanding among the peoples of the world . If this statement is trite , it is no less accurate . The community of nations in which we live finds itself compressed to a hitherto unbelievable degree by the almost magical speeding of its system of communications , by the dependent interests of its peoples -- economic and otherwise ? and by war , to a degree unimagined even in 1939 . The acceleration of these developments has been so great since then that , in reality , world leaders find themselves attempting to steer a course with no bearings and , perhaps until lately , without even a chart . It seems clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of nationals to understand how the foreigner thinks , what he wants , or why he wants it . The situation can hardly improve , and may even worsen , as apparently increasing nationalism and reaction give every indication of forcing the countries of the world into an isolationism as vicious as it is unnecessary . Fear , uncertainty and lack of knowledge of the unknown , perhaps more than any other thing , cause nation after nation to withdraw into itself , to build up tariffs and to increase armaments ; and the danger can be progressive in an era when mechanical and industrial development , accentuated and abetted by war , distances by far mankind 's progress toward the peaceful association of peoples . Fresh Minds Needed The age group that has lived through two wars is too old to learn new ideas and even the generation of the present war can or will want to learn little of those against whom , or even beside whom , it has fought ; indeed , in a short time it also will be too old to learn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the least of the dangers that confront the world today . There could , however , be a remedy which need not be illusory and which certainly would be entirely possible . Its merit would lie in the gradual but fundamental approach through fresh minds to the stark necessity of international understanding , an understanding which was of no particular interest to the American or European of one hundred years ago but which , in a much smaller world , is of urgent importance today . Such a remedy could be the exchange of students of many nations on a really broad scale , involving ultimately not hundreds but thousands of individuals . It is submitted that an exchange plan , student for student , among as many countries as will cooperate , financed by the subsidies of various Governments , is not only a desirable but a practical approach as well to a fundamental problem whose solution in the first instance would require only goodwill . The Rhodes scholarship plan was a venture in this direction , but as a priwate enterprise its application was limited and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis , thus avoiding the average student . Moreover , apart from the Dominions , and for a while ' Germany , it involved only England and the United States and ran in one direction ; namely , toward Britain . In the proposal at hand there would have to be a starting point , and it could be the Americas , England , France , and , it is to be hoped , Russia ? a group comprising the great political and economic entities of our time , with cultures that at least approach one another in form and in content . The statement has been made that the security of the future ahead of us depends on an understanding among America , Britain and Russia . This understanding , to mean anything , can not come from minds that are set . Broad Distribution Sought One can imagine , as an initial unit , a thousand students from the United States going to universities in England , Russia , France and South America on an exchange basis , student for student , to be followed annually by similar but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experience would later dictate further distribution , but there need be no restriction as to the number of countries ultimately included in such a plan . It is suggested parenthetically that , in due course , it should certainly include China , because the wise use of the Boxer indemnity funds for the education of thousands of young Chinese , over a period of many years , in the United States and , to a lesser degree , Great Britain is an inspiring example of foreign education and may well explain , in part at least , the constancy and loyalty of that country to its Western Allies in the present struggle . As each nation is involved , individual scholarships could be reciprocally granted by the subsidies of various Governments to the visiting student and in large enough amount to permit a year 's or perhaps two years ' attendance at one of a specified list of colleges or universities . The Rhodes grant to an individual is approximately $2,000 per annum . Granted cooperation from abroad , the mechanics of such an arrangement need not be complicated . American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that for those who would have the thought in mind , time need not be lost before they begin their life work . The telescoping of a college course by summer- study would not be too much to expect of student earlier indicating an intentio of becoming an exchange scholar , MI ( in any event , should prepare himse. beforehand in the language of the cour try for which he has previously d Glared . For the purpose of this pla . the exchange courses should specificall not include technical or profession ) training . They should be confined I studies in the humanities , recognize ( in general , in the United States , by tt A.

The benefit of such a plan would n ( express itself immediately , but wo ? . accrue ; and if the year 1970 find the civilized world with nr thousands of internationally educate students speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can now measure win the impact might be on world realities It is difficult to imagine it would 1 in harmful degree . JAMES GUILD , Andover , Mass. , Aug. 1 , 1945 . In Praise of Lactic Foods Pot Cheese , Especially , With Its of Names , Wins Favor To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES ; Your July 30 editorial , " Buttermil and Cheese , " measures up to Chant Lamb 's " Dissertation on Roast Pig " i whimsey and humor . To me , whose di ( calls for copious quantities of these la ( tic titbits , it had the consoling effect c a delicate poem or soul-soothing hymi I am sure that the spirits of Epicuru . Lucullus , Louis XVI , Diamond Jb Brady and other classic gourmands ar rejoicing . For the past year and a half my r7 ? 7s dish for breakfast has been pot chees , By publishing your erudite list of sync nyms for that delectable gustator gem , I now can vary my diet : Pc cheese on Sunday , cottage cheese o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its Germanic in : plications , on Wednesday . Your emphatic statement that " cot tage cheese is definitely not crear cheese , " has increased my fondness fc the latter and dispelled a harrowin doubt that affected my blood pressurt I am sure there will be no more confu sion or misunderstanding after you dictum , and your iambic declaratio that pot cheese " is full of curds an lumps and tasty little chunks . " give your little masterpiece a poetic toile that even Lamb would have had cliff : culty in surpassing . Seriously , in calling attention i. these meatless days to lactic foods c high protein content you are doing great , constructive service , and I hop you will amplify your fine work b , doing a piece on ice cream . The story of Vatel 's monumental dis covery , that when salt and ice ar mixed and are then brought in contac with milk it raises that commonplac fluid to ambrosial heights will , I ar sure , prove of interest from the scien tific standpoint , and will assuage som of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chops . If I may venture to make a sugget tion , a line or two on cheesecak which would point out that there i practically no limit to the culinar ; uses to which the " curds and lump and tasty little chunks " can be put . I have just drunk a. toast to you health and happiness and to THJ TIMES . The beverage ? Two flui ounces of curdful , non-synthetic but termilk , accurately measured and mi croscopically examined by a doctor wh has a lactic complex . To him calori and vitamin are synonyms of cheese .
