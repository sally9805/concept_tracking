txt Uniting the Country In your editorial you ask the question " What ' New Leadership ' ? " I 'll explain first that you are confused between leader and leadership . No one is going to change the leader who is President until January , 1945 . The leader now is representing Britain and small special groups in the country . A new leadership would be a change to representing all Americans until united again , and this can be done by the help of all , for the ultimate purpose of defending America honorably by preparing ourselves first and considl ering the welfare of America uppermost . Real leadership would surround itself with the ablest of men , such as Charles A. Lindbergh for the new Department of Air , John L. Lewis for Secretary of Labor , James A. Farley as Secretary of War , Charles P. Taft as Secretary of the Navy , Thomas E. Dewey as Secretary of the Department of Justice . This would unite America . J. P. MARSHALL . Larchmont , N. Y. , June 4 , 1941.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
