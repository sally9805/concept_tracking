txt General Charles de Gaulle , leader of Fighting France , will very shortly make " a strong personal appeal " to President Roosevelt to change the status of Admiral Francois Darien as French High Commissioner in North Africa , it was said in certain circles in London today . This information came on the heels of the refusal by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden , in the House of Commons , to permit immediate debate on a motion submitted by twelve Members cf Parliament , led by Aneurin Bevan. declaring that this country 's relations " with Darlan and his kind are inconsistent with the ideals for // DE GAULLE APPEAL TO ROOSEVELT SEEN // which we entered and are fighting this war . " There has been speculation for several days that General de Gaulle , whose adherents , if anything , are becoming more vociferous than ever in their opposition to Admiral Darlan 's appointment as high commissioner even as a " temporary expedient , " would appeal to Washington . Reports reaching here from the United States said that Secretary of State Cordell Hull had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While there were not any solid reasons for believing that this move would be successful in ousting Admiral Darlan and replacing him by some one acceptable to the de Gaullists , Fighting French circles were optimistic over the outcome . Sees Faith Undermined The motion submitted to the House of Commons today warned that , if the present relations of Britain and Admiral Darlan were persisted in , they would " undermine faith in us among our friends in the oppressed and invaded lands and impair the military , social and political prospects of the final and complete triumph of the cause of the United Nations . " Speaking on behalf of the government , Mr. Eden said that debate on this motion would be untimely and unhelpful while military operations were still at a critical stage in French North Africa . The sentiment expressed in the motion represented the private feelings of most members of the House , but the House as a whole was inclined to agree that public debate at this time would be inexpedient . It was believed that even some Cabinet Ministers probably held views akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggestions have been made that as an alternative to the debate Mr. Eden should address a private meeting of the members of the House representing all parties and Mr. Eden is expected to consider this suggestion in consultation with Prime Minister Churchill . But whether he will act on the suggestion is not by any means certain . No Conflict With Roosevelt A great deal is being done privately to clear up the situation that has developed rapidly within the last few days and that is still confusing to many . The immediate task is to make sure that Admiral Darlan 's new powers are not incompatible with President Roosevelt 's statement that the arrangement between Admiral Darlan and Lieut . Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , commander of the Allied forces in North Africa , was a temporary expedient . The view taken here is that West Africa 's declaration of loyalty to Admiral Darlan does not conflict with President Roosevelt 's statement . However , a larger question is raised by the possible attitude of Vichy representatives abroad who can now choose whether they will remain attached to Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Fighting French in opposition to both Admiral Darlan and M. Laval . At the same time it is foreseen that a considerable interval must elapse before any progress can be made toward an understanding between the Fighting French and those elements who are cooperating with Allied forces in North Africa . Advocating immediate discussion of the North African situation in the House of Commons , Mr. Bevan pointed out that there was a considerable body of disturbed opinion throughout Britain on the subject . He asserted that the House should discuss it " before we are irretrievably committed to eslishing Darlan in North Africa and extension of the same policy to other fields of foreign policy . " Mr. Eden replied : " What the government has to bear in mind is whether it is timely in relation to the military operation , and on that point I made what I think was quite a clear reply yesterday , to which I have nothing to add . " Not Under British Control Mr. Eden concurred with Sir Herbert Williams that civilian governments in French North Africa did not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He added : " The military power is the United States and the present civilian power is French power , and our position has to be related to those two facts . " Mr. Bevan asked if it was in the public interest or of good relations with the United States that reports should go abroad to the effect that " these unpleasant and undesirable policies are being imposed on us by the United States . " Mr. Eden retorted : " I have never said anything of the kind , but I think the Members must realize that we are dealing with what is an extremely delicate situation at the moment when our troops and American troops are engaged in a very critical ' phase of the campaign . " In the course of today 's discussion Mr. Eden said in answer to a question by Edgar L. Granville that he was doing everything he could to bring about the resumption of Fighting French broadcasts at the earliest possible moment . He repeated that the " temporary " stoppage of these broadcasts was not due to any action by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
