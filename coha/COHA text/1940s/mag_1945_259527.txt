With the American League pennant odds even-Stephen at " 6-to-5 and take your pick , " the first-place Detroit Tigers limped into Washington last week for the payoff . Lefty Hal Newhouser ( won 22 , lost 9 ) had the miseries in his back ; Slugger Hank Greenberg was out with a sprained ankle ; Sparkplug Eddie Mayo had a wrenched shoulder . <P> The base-stealing pitcher-rich Senators , only a half-game back in second place , were set for a kill . Manager Ossie Bluege 's razor-sharp club had won ten of its last thirteen games . <P> At the start , the script read true to form : Newhouser 's arm lasted only an inning ; Greenberg , pinch-hitting , hobbled to the plate and slapped into a rally-ending double play . But other Tigers supplied crushing ad libs . <P> After they drove knuckleballer Dutch Leonard ( 16-7 ) to cover-Leonard pitched the Tigers out of last year 's pennant-40-year-old Doc Cramer broke up the party with a game-winning triple .

That helped Dizzy Trout ( 18-14 ) realize an iron-man promise to win five games in two weeks . Score : Detroit 7 , Washington 3 . <P> Irishman with a Combination . Nothing mattered much after that . Detroit split the next day 's doubleheader . Washington , with only six games left to play , was a gloomy four games back in the lost column .

He had been holding his breath for three months as the Tigers grimly held their first-place grip . A down-to-earth Irishman , O'Neill had done much with little. + <P> There were two key plays in Manager Steve 's pennant drive . Last spring , he wangled Roy Cullenbine from Cleveland , laid it on the line in a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of banging 17 homers ( third highest in the league ) and batting in 89 runs ( second highest ) .
