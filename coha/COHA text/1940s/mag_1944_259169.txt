One of the world 's most tantalizing murder mysteries last week received a belated public airing . <P> It began in Rome one day in June 1924 , when an old woman sitting in a doorway and a little boy playing in the street saw a grey Fiat sedan pull up to a curb . Five men jumped out , grabbed Socialist Deputy Giacomo Matteotti , leader of the opposition to Benito Mussolini . They wrestled him into the car . It raced away . That was the last that was seen of Matteotti until his body , stabbed 36 times , beaten , partly burned , was found a few days later in a Roman ditch . <P> All over the world , Socialists , Liberals , Communists pointed a finger at Mussolini and cried : " Murderer ! " <P> The hubbub in Italy was tremendous . If Mussolini 's complicity in the murder had been proved , he would have been driven from the Government . Nobody did prove it . Cried Mussolini : " Only an enemy who for long nights had thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> He arrested five alleged assassins , headed by Amerigo Dumini , a boastful , U.S.-born gangster and Fascist . He forced other suspects into hiding . Among them : Filippelli , editor of Rome 's only Fascist newspaper , Cornere Italiano . <P> The Ghost Walks . The crisis passed . <P> Mussolini was saved . But somehow the world never forgot the crime . From time to time Matteotti 's ghost , started up to haunt Mussolini . From time to time people involved in the murder talked . But they never really told anything . Nevertheless there was a perennial rumor that the Corriere Italiano 's editor Filippelli ( who has since dropped out of sight ) had written a full confession . Only one photostated copy of the confession existed . <P> In Rome last week able New York Timesman Herbert L. Matthews somehow procured ( he would not say where ) and published Filippelli 's 20-year-old photostat . The confession had been paraphrased in part in George Seldes ' Sawdust Caesar . Matthews reported the full text . <P> The Ghost Talks . Filippelli confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well known to the President of the Fascist Council , Honorable Mussolini . <P> " Dumini 1 ) had carried out an assault on Misuri Deputy Alfred Misuri , 2 ) had worked in France , 3 ) had recently assaulted Forni Deputy Cesare Forni in a station at Milan with Mussolini 's knowledge and connivance . . . . <P> " Monday , June 9 , 1924 , Dumini asked me for a car for three or four days . He told me it would be used by some of his friends and that I would be doing something which would give pleasure to Rossi Fascist Press Chief and Marinelli then Economic Secretary of the Fascist party . . . . I agreed that Dumini should use a car that I hired . <P> <P> " I knew nothing more until Tuesday evening around midnight . . . . <P> Something in a Newspaper . " Dumini entered my office with something rolled up in a newspaper believed to have been Matteotti 's bloody clothing and asked me to find him a place where he could keep the automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned on him that Gangster Dumini had used his car to commit a political murder . Filippelli was shocked and panicky . He did not yet know who the victim was .
