At night the moon still bowed her pale head above the sea . The languorous trade wind drifted across the water . Storms broke on the dark crest of Diamond Head , stalked down the swift slope to the harbor . But Hawaii was not the same . Alone in the great quiet of the Pacific , 2,100 miles from any continent , Hawaii waited . The tension was strung tight as harp wires . <P> Mutter . The Japs made the tension . Of the 423,330 Hawaiian inhabitants , about 40,000 are Japanese aliens . Another 120,000 are citizens of Japanese descent . They are woven beyond unraveling into the fabric of Hawaiian life-they serve in the Army , labor in the fields and refineries , work on war projects . Japs known to be unfriendly ( consuls , enemy agents , teachers ) have been segregated on Sand Island . Some have been shipped back to the U.S. Japs ' guns and short-wave radios have been confiscated . But if Lieut . General Delos C. Emmons ordered all Japs interned , Hawaii 's economy might fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets last week as much as possible . They were scrupulously polite . A group of loyal Jap-American employes of a Waikiki hotel asked to be locked in a concentration camp at night , said they would go straight to work in the morning , pay part of the upkeep of the camp . ( The Army turned down their offer . ) <P> Butter . The food supply was another source of worry . About 70% of Hawaii 's food normally comes from the mainland , ten days ' voyage away by freighter . Two years ago , when 241,000 acres of the rich land of the islands were planted in sugar cane , only 695 acres were used for rice , 76 for asparagus , three acres for grapefruit . Since Pearl Harbor , the islands have stored a six months ' supply of food in case of siege . But meat is scarce . <P> Now , under martial law , General Emmons has requisitioned sugar lands for use as airports , gun emplacements , kitchen gardens . The big Aiea Plantation , near Pearl Harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden crops ) . But years will be needed to make Hawaii self-sufficient . <P> Beyond the Blue . There are more planes and more men on the islands than there were on Dec. 7 . Hawaii is guarded by more artillery than was ever before gathered in one place under the U.S. flag . <P> Where the slim wahine ( Hawaiian women ) once strolled along the beach at Waikiki , barbed wire is looped in crazy , glistening coils . Soldiers with naked bayonets patrol the docks . Parks and schoolyards are scarred with fresh-dug trenches . Howitzers hide in the cane fields . Men sleep by their guns on the beach and in caves hollowed out of the mountains . <P> Hawaii is dark as the grave . Hawaiians say proudly that Honolulu 's blackout is " blacker than London 's . " After curfew sounds , at 9 p.m. , any civilian found on the street may be arrested or shot . <P> Traffic is light , with gas rationed : ten gallons a month to each car owner . The bright waters between the islands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On every vacant lot , and on the long green golf-course fairways , old iron and battered jalopies are scattered to keep enemy planes from landing .
