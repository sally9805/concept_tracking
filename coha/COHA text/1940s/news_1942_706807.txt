txt With emphasis shifting from the home to the factory in the scrap metal drive , the Civilian Defense Volunteer Office will start today to concentrate on the household salvage of rubber , fats , rags , tin cans and silk and nylon hosiery . James G. Blaine , city CDVO chairman , announced last night plans for visits to every home in the city by salvage workers , who will renew their drive for the va- I rious critical materials at the request of the War Production Board 's conservation division . The visits , which will be made through the newly set up CDVO group leader organization , will explain to householders how to prepare the materials for salvage and arrange for their collection . The fur and garment industries will empty their shops and factories of scrap metal and throw it onto their Victory piles today , amid parades and ceremonies . Tonight leaders of the embroidery , pleating , stitching and buttonhole industries will meet with R. Merrill Decker , regional director of the WPB industrial salvage section , to get their metal salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Guardia , Mr. Blaine and other city and Federal officials are to attend the " Tin Can Ball " at the Hotel Astor tonight . The event is to spur the tin can salvage and raise funds for CDVO expenses . Mentioning in his weekly broadcast that the city would be paid $4.50 a ton for its household scrap metal by the junk dealers , the Mayor said he wanted to make it clear that it .. would be impossible to donate the scrap to the Federal Government . He confirmed the report that the city would sign an agreement today for removal of the scrap to the steel mills . " The government buys steel and pays for it , " he said , " and no matter how ws would try there is no way that the government could take it over directly . I think Tye broken down this idea that some gentlemen of the salvage division of the WPB had in Washington to try to make the American people believe that donating it to the junk and waste dealers was donating it to the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the junk dealers and the government pays the steel mills . So we will dispose of this to the waste dealers , not as was suggested , very cleverly , by some of the gentlemen of the salvage division of the WPB . We will dispose of it at $4.50 a ton . Every Mayor of this country has had the same trouble . " Declaring that " the industrial scrap problem is still on our hands , " the Mayor said that Park Commissioner Robert Moses was " not without justification " when he resigned as director of the city 's industrial salvage drive , blaming lack of Federal cooperation in moving the heavy scrap metal . The Mayor pointed out that James M. Hopwood of Pittsburgh had resigned a few days ago as president of War Materials , Inc. , one of the Federal agencies involved in the situation that had led to Mr. Moses 's earlier resignation , and added : " You know , the War Materials , Inc. , is a corporation under the RFC . The Reconstruction Finance Corporation is headed by very energetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the government really needs the industrial scrap , the thing to do would be to let it be handled entirely by this War Materials , Inc. , under Jessee Jones , and then the scrap will start to fly . " In the meantime I will keep you informed of the disposition of this scrap metal which the people of this city contributed , but please be patient about it  --  it will take I several weeks . I 'm going to see what we can do about expediting getting it to the mills . " Several scrap dealers among the nine in the pool that is buying the city 's household scrap metal have estimated that it would be more likely several months before the last of the scrap now heaped high in several depots throughout the city gets to the mills . Mr. Blaine , announcing the CVDO drive for a variety of scrap materials , said that metals were only one phase of the salvage job . " The government wants every one of us to turn in everything which can be used to blast the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not end until the war ends . "
