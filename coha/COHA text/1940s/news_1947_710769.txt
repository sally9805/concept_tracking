txt Review of Book on General Patton JOHN N. WHEELER . pg . 20 Letter 's to The Times Review of Book on General Patton To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your book reviewer , Orville Prescott , says Col. Robert S. Allen , author of " Lucky Forward , " is prejudiced in favor of Patton . That may be , but certainly Mr. Prescott , in his review , is prejudiced against General Patton and Colonel Allen . If Mr. Prescott read the book he should realize it deals with the campaign of the Third Army in France and would not have suggested the author deliberately avoided any reference to the slapping incident . That took place before General Patton was in command of the Third Army and before Colonel Allen was on Patton 's staff , so he would have no particular knowledge of it . Again , he points out that Colonel Allen does not mention General Patton could not distinguish Nazis from Democrats , but neglects to consider General Patton* was trying to organize Germany under difficult conditions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mild former Nazis are helpful , in the process Of reconstruction .. Perhaps I should admit I am prejudiced , since Colonel Allen writes for the North American Newspaper Alliance ( which I  - -  un ) , is a , fine correspondent , and lost his right arm in action . JOHN N. WHEELER . New York , Sept. 25 , 1947.
