Let me make the songs of a nation , and I care not who makes its laws . <P> - Andrew Fletcher , 1703 . <P> In the politically violent land of Cuba there is often some doubt as to who , exactly , is writing the laws . But there is never any doubt as to who is the chief songwriter in that melodious land . He is Ernesto Lecuona . He wrote the famed , romantic air which outsiders could scarcely be blamed for supposing was the Cuban National Anthem-Siboney. * He wrote Canto Karabali ( Jungle Drums ) , Andalucia ( The Breeze and I ) , La Comparsa , Say Si Si , Maria La O , and a host of other numbers which have made Cuban melody world-famed . <P> Last week , armed with the title of Cultural Attach of the Cuban Embassy , solid , swarthy Ernesto Lecuona was rushing around Manhattan doing a number of things no diplomat had ever done before . He had just signed one of the biggest song-publishing contracts ever negotiated on Broadway . He had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two ) on 15 numbers for a new musical show . He was combing Hollywood agents out of his vaselined hair . He had gathered together an orchestra of some 60 pieces and turned Carnegie Hall into a cave of Caribbean melody . <P> Even in the U.S. Lecuona 's tunes outsell those of many a top-flight Tin Pan Alleyite ( Decca alone has sold over 1,700,000 records of Andalucia ) . They also stay in the top sales brackets longer than most Tin Pan Alley songs ( Malaguea has been averaging 100,000 sheet-music sales a year in the U.S. for 20 years ) . <P> Boy Bandsman . But Ernesto Lecuona 's biggest popularity lies south , of the Tropic of Cancer . There his eminence is fabulous . Cuba has two other top-rank songwriters : Moises Simons ( The Peanut Vendor ) and Eliseo Grenet ( Mama Ines ) . But Lecuona 's 300-odd songs and piano pieces , to which Latin Americans have been listening for more than two decades , have become as indelible a part of their culture as the Spanish and Portuguese tongues . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Havana , a businessman named Ricardo Lecuona was killed in a plane crash in Colombia . While news flashes mistakenly identified the dead man as Ernesto , radio stations in Mexico , Peru , Chile , Brazil and Argentina went off the air for periods of silence in his honor . <P> Unlike most popular songwriters , 47-year-old Lecuona is also a virtuoso concert pianist and a composer of symphonic music . Son of a Havana newspaperman , he began composing at the age of eleven with a two-step called Cuba Y America . Cuban military bands still play it . A boyhood star at Havana 's National Conservatory under Composer Joaquin Nin , Lecuona organized his own band and appeared in Havana 's movie houses in long trousers borrowed from an older friend . At 21 he traveled to the U.S. and made player-piano rolls of his early hits . <P> Lecuona was among the first to introduce rumba music to the U.S. public-in 1922 at Broadway 's Capitol Theatre . Later he went to Paris , where he hobnobbed with the late Maurice Ravel and continued studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America as a concert pianist . He has since made equally wide but more informal tours with a rumba outfit called Lecuona 's Cuban Boys , has also written 30 musical comedies , most of them in collaboration with Cuban Librettist Gustavo Galarraga.
