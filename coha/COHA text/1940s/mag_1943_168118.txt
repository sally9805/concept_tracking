Ever since Mahatma Gandhi pulled through his fast , Indians and British alike have been standoffishly waiting for a next move-for Gandhi 's survival by no means closed the issue for which he failed to die . There were some moves last week , but they only widened the breach . <P> The British Raj issued a 76-page pamphlet entitled Statement Published by the Government of India on the Congress Party 's Responsibility for the Disturbances in India , 1942-43 . The pamphlet quoted at length from Gandhi 's writings in the paper Harijan , from his speeches and those of Congress officers , from pamphlets and articles . Some were clearly inflammatory : " Leave India to God ; if that is too much , then leave her to anarchy . . . . " " If in spite of all precautions rioting does take place , it can not be helped . " But some of the statements which were cited as evidences of treason echoed slogans which have had a certain appeal in U.S. history : " Let every Indian consider himself to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death would be the motto of every son and daughter of India . If we live we live as free men . . . . " <P> One impediment to freedom has been the failure of the Indian National Congress party and the Moslem League to reach a common ground which would give India internal peace with her freedom . Last week , despite the differences , the Moslem League rose to the defense of the Congress and answered the White Paper . The League 's paper , Dawn , remarked that it was not fair to present one side of the case while the defendant was held silent behind bars . " For the Viceroy to be both prosecutor and judge carries its own commentary . " <P> Publication of the White Paper , said Dawn , " has not been designed to improve relations between the two countries . . . . In the fundamental demand for removal of British sovereignty , Indians are in agreement . " <P> Industry 's View . The industrial , if not the human , resources of India have been pretty well behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength in the Far East . Nevertheless , a spokesman for Indian industry sharply criticized the British last week . Said G. L. Mehta , president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry : " In India , the program of defense , civil or military , is not broadly based on popular will . The demand for application to India of principles for whose vindication the United Nations claim to be waging this war . . . has remained unheeded . " <P> Mr. Mehta 's statement was not entirely free of self-interest . Wrote New York Times Correspondent Herbert L. Matthews from Calcutta recently : " Big Indian firms like the Birla Brothers of Bombay finance the All-India Congress . . . . Indian rivals of British businessmen want to get their businesses away from them , and in that struggle much is involved , political as well as financial . "
