Frankie comes to call A Story by Betty Smith I T WAS the night that Frankie was coming to meet her folks . Margy was on her feet two blocks before Maujer Street in agony as to whether the motorman would stop at that corner . Fortunately , another passenger wanted to get off at that block and while the motorman might ignore one passenger 's desires , he could n't ignore two . She got home ten minutes earlier than usual . She need n't have hurried . Flo , her mother , had everything under control . The chopped meat , onions , and potatoes were in the frying pan . The flat was immaculate . " Oh , everything looks so nice , Mama , " said Margy . " And you look nice , too . " Indeed , Flo looked nice . She had on a freshly laundered house dress and she had shampooed her hair that morning . Ho was only thirty-nine and still slender and shapely . She would have looked young and pretty if it had n't been for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all , " said Flo . " Look ! " She opened the icebox . Alone on the top shelf was a small , round , high , creamy cheesecake and a half-pint bottle of coffee cream . " Real cream for coffee when he comes . " " You shouldn't 've , " protested Margy . " Frankie 's used to condensed milk in his coffee just like us . " " If he 's coming here with the idea that we 're shanty Irish trash , he 's going to find himself mistaken , " said Flo . " Why , Mama , he never had any such idea . " " What other idea could he have ? A girl lets him meet her on the sly without her parents knowing . She takes jewelry from him when she hardly knows him and keeps it from her mother . So he ca n't have much of an opinion of her and her family . " " I would 've brought him home to meet you long ago only I was afraid you 'd carry on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming ? " asked Flo . Yes ! Margy wanted to shout . Instead she said , " Aw , Mama , you got everything fixed so nice and you 're so swell about entertaining him , do n't spoil it all now . " Somehow , this got to Flo and she said nothing more . Henny got home early . He had saved time by doing the opposite of Margy , riding a block past his corner , which saved some minutes spent in futile argument with the motorman . He ate quickly , ignoring his newspaper for once , and then put on a clean shirt , collar , and tie . He got his vest out of the closet , brushed it , and hung it on the back of a chair . Margy washed , put on fresh make-up and a new white georgette blouse . By eight o'clock the three clean Shannons were sitting stiffly and silently in their kitchen waiting to receive the suitor . When the bell rang at a quarter-past eight , the Shannons as one got to their feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , Henny got into his vest and Flo led the way to the parlor . ARGY , watching Frankie come up the stairs , saw him through her parents ' j.V l critical eyes and decided that he 'd do . He had had his suit pressed and a bay-rum barbershop smell preceded his entrance . She introduced him self-consciously before she took his hat and placed it in the exact middle of the bed in the adjoining room . Frankie came with gifts : a box of peanut brittle for his future mother-in-law , a couple of two-for-a-quarter cigars for Henny , and a corsage of lavender sweet peas tied with tinsel ribbon for Margy . Flo thanked him stiffly but Margy knew she was pleased . Henry made much of the cigars assuring Frankie that he was a young man who certainly knew his tobacco . But Henny did n't smoke cigars . He placed them in his vest pocket intending to present them to his foreman in hope of gaining some small concession in exchange . Margy beamed with pride as she pinned the corsage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of candy around . The peanut brittle came in for sprightly praise . They talked about the gifts as long as they could . Then the conversation died . No one said anything for a long time . Henny , knowing it was his duty as host to keep the talk flowing , put his stiff curved hands on his knees , leaned forward , cleared his throat , looked directly into Frankie 's eyes and asked : " Do you think light wines and beer will ever come back ? " It was a frequent question in those days . Frankie looked confused but pulled himself together . " You can search me , " was his considered opinion . Flo put in her two-cents ? worth . " Maybe the young man ai n't interested in blind tigers . " " Pigs , " corrected Henny . " Saloons , tigers , speakeasies , cider stores , call them blind pigs , even , " conceded Flo . " All mean the same thing  --  a place where a man gets drunk and spends his hard-earned money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to explain that he never got drunk ; that he spent very little money in saloons ; that he went there merely to relax in talk with other men . But out of consideration for their guest , he said nothing . He tried a different conversational approach . " Me , I 'm all for keeping the law . But they got no right to take a workingman 's beer away from him . Prohibition was put over on us while our boys was dying in the trenches . That reminds me : was you with the Rainbow Division , Mr. Malone ? " " I never saw action , " admitted Frankie : " I happened to be in second-year High when the war broke out . " " You should have known , " Flo reproached her husband . " I only thought ... so many of our Brooklyn boys was with the Rainbow Division , " apologized Henny , " that I thought you was one of them . " " I was only a kid myself , " put in Margy brightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war on . But I saw Rudolph Valentino in the ' Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ' and that showed that war is a terrible thing . " All agreed that war was a terrible thing and again the talk died out . Margy revived it . " Still and all , " she said , " there were the poems that came out of the war . I love the one about the poppies growing between the crosses row on row . " " My favorite , " said Frankie , " is , ' I Have a Rendezvous with Death . ' " They urged him to recite it but he begged off saying he did n't know all the words . Henny came out of a deep study . " Rondy-voo ? " he asked puzzled . " It means a date , " said Margy . " It means we all got to go someday , " amplified Flo . " Knock wood , " suggested Frankie . The quartet beat a brief tattoo on the arms of their chairs . There was a solemn pause  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took matters into his own hands and rejected death as a conversational theme . He brought the talk back to poetry . " There 's a piece , not about the war exactly but I like it anyway . It goes like this : In all my life , I 've got to see A poem as lovely as a tree . H is wife and daughter looked at him in blank astonishment . They had never heard the word , lovely , come from his lips . They looked at him so strangely that he felt he had to apologize . " Only reason I read it when it was in the Brooklyn Eagle was that the feller what wrote it was a Brooklyn boy what got killed in the war . They got a I.egion post named after him , now : the Joyce Kilmer Post they call it . " Margy was proud of her father for knowing that . " You know a lot of things , Papa , " she said . " Oh , I get around , " said Henny debonairly . Flo pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around to saloons and wherever else bums hang out . " Brooklyn is a wonderful place in many ways , " expanded Henny , heady with his daughter 's compliment . " There 's many a famous person come from Brooklyn . " And most of them are ashamed of it , too , " said Flo , making ashes out of his pride . " That 's because some dumb people do n't realize Brooklyn 's a fine city . " " This part of Brooklyn ai n't fine , " said Flo , " the way the neighborhood 's run down . " " This neighborhood ai n't all of Brooklyn , I 'll let you know , " said loyal Henny . " Well , it 's all the Brooklyn we 'll ever know , " clinched Flo . She stood up and asked to be excused and left the room abruptly . Frankie looked puzzled . " Mama went out to make coffee , " explained Margy . " Oh ! For a minute I thought something out of the way was said , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversational topics . They had discussed the fiery question of the day , the right of a strong minority to inflict prohibition on an unwilling majority . Henny had made a brief statement concerning the rights of the workingman . They had acknowledged the horrors of war and the beauty of poetry : the inevitability of death , and had skirmished briefly with the subject of civic pride . There remained three more general topics of conversation to get them through the rest of the evening : religion , politics and the weather . Henny tackled politics . " It it 's not a personal question , Mr. Malone , " he asked politely , " I 'd like to know whether you 're a Republican or whether you vote the Democratic ticket . " His voice capitalized Democrat but put Republican in the lower case . " I cast my first vote this coming election , " said Frankie proudly , " and of course , I 'll vote the straight Democratic ticket . " " That 's fine , " approved Henny . " Then I take it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House  --  Harding . " " No use at all , " pronounced Frankie . Henny got up and shook the boy 's hand . They were one against the Republican party . After a while Flo appeared in the alcove . " There 's coffee , " she announced . They went out into the kitchen . There was a fresh cloth on the table . Instead of the usual custom of placing the cut cake in the center of the table where all could reach for a piece to eat with their hands , Flo had set out cake plates and forks . Margy was proud of her mother for knowing and doing the right thing . Frankie stood in the middle of the kitchen and looked around . " May I wash my hands ? " he asked politely . Margy , knowing that his request was a delicate way of asking where the bathroom was , was filled with consternation . They had no bathroom ! Literal Flo produced a small enameled basin which she placed in the sink , handed the boy a clean towel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie held the towel in his hands and looked frustrated . Henny drew him into the bedroom next to the kitchen . " The toilet 's in the hall , " said Henny in a hoarse whisper heard by the two women in the kitchen . " I 'll get you the key . " " I just want to wash my hands , " lied Frankie in a clear loud voice . The two men came out of the bedroom . Frankie 's face was brick-red with embarrassment . He washed his clean hands at the sink and dried them thoroughly . They sat down to coffee and cake . F RANK1E , trying desperately to ingratiate himself with Margy 's parents , praised the cheesecake , claiming it was creamier than the kind sold on his block . He asked where the bakery store was , saying he intended to buy a duplicate cake to take home to his mother . Flo was anxious to know the boy 's religion . To that end , she asked him bluntly what church he attended . He told her St. Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , implying that people who went elsewhere just did n't count . " I mean , Margy and me go , " she added giving her husband a bitter look . " Sunday 's the one day in the week when a workingman can sleep late , " said Henny defensively . " You could go to twelve-o'clock Mass , " said his wife . " That 's High Mass and too long . " Before Flo and Henry could get off on an argument , Frankie announced his impending departure . " I guess I better make a break , " he said , " and not wear out my welcome by staying too long . " They trooped back to the parlor . Margy held his hat while he made his polite farewells . " I enjoyed the conversation , ? he said , " and the coffee and cake . " Feeling that this was inadequate , he added , " You certainly have a nice home here , Mrs. Shannon . " Then it came ! " I 'm glad you realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand , then , that Margy 's in no hurry to leave her home and get married until she can have even a nicer home than this . " Frankie 's face colored quickly . " I happen to come from a pretty nice home myself , Mrs. Shannon , " he said with dignity . Margy , trying desperately to change the conversation called out " Look ! It 's beginning to sprinkle . " All went to look out of the window at the light rain which had begun to fall . " What 's a little rain ? " asked Frankie . " But you 'll ruin your press , " she said . " I happen to have another suit home , strange as it may seem , " said Frankie coldly . Stiff goodnights were exchanged . Margy walked down the stairs with Frankie . As they reached the bottom , Mrs. Shannon called over the bannister : " Thanks for the peanut brittle and all . " " You 're welcome . l'ut sure , " he called back . W HEN they yeached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss but she held him there in the dark cubicle . All former doubts of her love for the boy vanished when she realized how vulnerable he was to hurt and how she had hurt him indirectly through her parents . She decided that she wanted to stand between him and hurt fol. the rest of their lives . It does n't matter , it does n't matter , " she soothed him . " Mama 's that way to everyone . " " That crack about taking you out of your rich home , " he sneered . " She did n't mean anything . " " Oh , no ? " " Well , even if she did , what does it matter ? I 'm the one you 're marrying , not her . And I think you 're wonderful . " " Thanks for nothing . " She held him tightly , murmuring comforting words . He stood unyielding in her arms . Finally she said : " And we 'll be married very soon . " That won him over . His arms went around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show them ! I 'll show them all someday . " " I know . I know you will , " she whispered back in fierce faith . They gave promises to each other . He finished off the evening by passing fair judgment on Margy 's parents . " Your old man 's not a had guy ; " he said . " But your mother . . . " he decided to be charitable . " Well I guess she 's got her troubles , " he con-ceded . " They 're really all right , " she said . " Its just that you have to get used to their ways . " " It was sure hard talking to them , " he said . " I do n't mind saying I was nervous . " " You know , " said Margy , " I was wondering when we 'd get around to talking about the weather . " " You had a hell of a time bringing it in , all right . " " I thought I 'd die . " " Come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , did n't we ? " Suddenly the strain of the evening was lifted and they started to snicker as they recalled the more humorous aspects of the visit . The snickers changed to giggles and the giggles to laughter . Margy laughed so hard that she became weak and had to hold on to Frankie . They laughed until they cried . The laughter came up the stairs  --  through the closed doors of the flat . The father and mother , hearing the young laughter , exchanged a slow look of defeat .
