Almost all her life , Amparo Iturbi has played second piano to her famous brother Jose . If they were n't rippling away together on the Mozart concerto for two pianos , Jose was usually on the podium , conducting while she pounded out the solo part . One of Jose 's favorite cracks : " I am my sister 's worst enemy . " <P> Last week , Amparo set out to show her brother , and the public , " what she can do on her own . She picked a bad time and a worse place : Philadelphia 's Robin Hood Dell , the night the Republican convention opened . When she finished Liszt 's bombastic Piano Concerto No. 1 , the 5,000 people in the Dell cheered . The critics cheered too , but less noisily : Amparo had some of her brother 's lightning in her fingers , but not enough of his thunder . <P> Amparo , who is three years younger than Jose , flares up when she is called his pupil , but admits that " Jose is my god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Jose played the piano . When Jose went to the Paris Conservatory , Amparo wanted to go too , but Jose said no : " It 's all work . One gets nothing but exhaustion . And for her it 's not necessary . " That is why , she says , she is still a " kind of wild pianist . " At 18 , Amparo arrived in Paris under her own steam , made her debut as a pianist six years later . Finally , just before the Spanish civil war broke out , Jose persuaded her to join him in the U.S. <P> Long divorced from her Spanish husband , Amparo lives in Beverly Hills with her 17-year-old daughter Amparin . Amparo believes that concertizing " is a crazy life , " though she has lined up a 30-concert tour for fall . She also plans to make recordings , though she regards the process as " the ultimate torture of our century . "
