txt General Sir John G. Dill will retire as Chief of the Imperial General Staff ? the highest post in the British Army ? upon reaching his sixtieth birthday on Christmas Day this year , it was announced today . He will be succeeded by Lieut . Gen. Sir Alan Brooke , Commander in Chief of the Home Forces . The change in the head of the empire military forces was naturally enough accompanied by a general shake-up in the High Command . General Dill , who was made a field marshal he will probably figure in the next honors list as a peer , becomes Governor of Bombay , which is one of the most important jobs in the Indian Government and second only to that of the Viceroy . General Brooke is succeeded as Commander in Chief of the Home Forces by Lieut . Gen. Bernard C. Paget , who is now General Officer Commanding in Chief of the Southeastern Command . General Paget 's old job goes to Lieut . Gen. B. L. Montgomery , at present a divisional commander . Lieut . Gen. Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staff and is succeeded by Major Gen. Archibald Edward Nye , lately Director of Staff Duties at the War Office . " I have always been anxious that young men in the army get on , " General Dill said tonight in an unprecedented statement ? unprecedented because British officers do not usually issue state- ments when they relinquish their jobs . " That can only happen if older men give way to them . You all know General Brooke and his fine record : I hand over the duty of Chief of the Imperial General Staff to him with the-greatest confidence . General Paget you also know . He is one of our finest generals . " " The new Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff is an officer of my old regiment whom I have long marked out for rapid advancement . He , as you know , replaces General Pownall who is required for a most important appointment which will be announced before long . " Thus General Dill retires from the job he has held since May , 1940 , with all dignity . The official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 60 , and that he has held the tremendous and exacting job of Commander in Chief since May , 1940 , about as long as any one man could possibly stand the strain . Those are the two official reasons and they are probably accurate so far as they go . On the other hand , there is no doubt that General Dill had his critics as not being forward enough or aggressive enough . There is no reason to believe that he and Prime Minister Churchill are on anything but the best of terms . Nevertheless , it is probably true that the general 's attaining the age of 60 came somewhat conveniently for the Churchill Cabinet . Brooke an Artillery Officer The new head of the Empire Armies is a man who has long had Mr. Churchill 's confidence and trust . General Brooke , like most of the coming men in the British Army , is a gunner by trade . In the last war , as an artillery officer , he won the Distinguished Service Order and a bar to it , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in dispatches . He commanded the Second Army Corps in France in this war and took part at Dunkerque . Then he was made Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces , with the task of making these islands impregnable against invasion . The best story involved in the changes is that of the promotion of General Nye . He is that rare thing in the high command of the British Army  --  a man who has risen straight through the ranks . The son of a sergeant , he enlisted in the Leinster Regiment at the start of the war and served in the ranks for a year and two months . Then he received a commission in the Warwickshires and later transferred to the Prince of Wales Volunteers , where he became a captain and brevet major . Despite the handicap of ranker origin  --  it is considerable in the British Army just as it is in the United States Army in peacetime ? General Nye stuck with the Army and made it his career . There is no question that Mr. Churchill had a great deal to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his ideas and pushed him on until today , practically unknown to the British public , he is appointed to one of the biggest jobs in the British military heirarchy . General Pownall 's new job is being kept a complete mystery . It is obviously one of importance and one of fighting significance . Beyond that the press is not encouraged to speculate .
