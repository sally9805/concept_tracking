An old weapon in a new , more deadly form will soon return to the U.S. Army : the carbine-a short barreled rifle . <P> The Army 's new carbine will be short enough ( 36 in. ) , light enough ( about 5 Ib. ) to replace the famous but erratic .45 pistol as a small arm for officers and noncoms . It will also give infantrymen , paratroopers , cavalrymen , tankers , machine gunners an effective supplementary weapon . Designed for rapid fire ( either semiautomatic , like the Garand rifle , or full automatic , like a machine gun ) , it will enormously increase the amount of lead the U.S. Army can spit at its enemies . <P> Secretary of War Stimson last week called this innovation " one of the most significant changes of weapons for the Army that has ever taken place . " But it is still a future change . Army Ordnance Designer John C. Garand , who developed the Army 's new rifle , has an experimental model of the new carbine almost ready for final tests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to keep secret until tests are completed .
