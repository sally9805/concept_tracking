The stage was set last week for the hottest political fight U.S. airlines have ever tangled in . The prize : postwar international air transport . Last week , 16 ( out of 19 ) airlines plunked $250,000 into a brand-new committee to fight for " free " worldwide competition . Their aim : to blast out of its top-dog spot Pan American Airways , which monopolized prewar international air travel . <P> This was no cat- &-dog; wrangle . Behind the potent new committee ( The Airlines Committee on International Routes ) was the tremendous prestige-and smart flyer 's brains-of the Army Air Forces ' chief , General H. H. ( " Hap " ) Arnold . Ten days ago , General Arnold hastily called a hush-hush meeting in Washington of the U.S. airlines which operate routes for the Army 's world-straddling Air Transport Command . ( Pan American was included . ) General Arnold advised them to take steps . <P> What these steps should be came out at the second-and widely publicized-meeting of 16 U.S. airlines last week . This time Pan Am did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates to Ireland ) , nor United Air Lines . The reason was soon plain . <P> The Harpoon . The conferees adopted a five-point program : 1 ) free and open worldwide air competition , subject to reasonable Federal regulation ; 2 ) private ownership and management ; 3 ) Federal encouragement of a worldwide air transport system ; 4 ) worldwide freedom of transit in peaceful flight ; 5 ) acquisition by the U.S. of the civil and commercial outlets required in the public interest . <P> The harpoon for Pan Am came in a statement of policy : " There can be no rational basis for permitting " air transport outside the U.S. to be " left to the withering influence of monopoly . " To implement the new " free " policy , the 16 airlines served notice on CAB that they will promptly file petitions for permission to operate worldwide air routes . <P> Weapon to Swing . In the face of this all-out attack , Pan Am 's suave President Juan T. Trippe was mum , but not idle . United Air Lines , second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route , had been reported in favor of the new committee . United did not appear at the second session . Then news came that United now favored a policy in which one company " or at the most two or three in different territories " should operate the U.S. share of international airlines . . <P> No secret is General Arnold 's dislike of Pan Am 's peacetime monopoly . When ATC was set up , he gave domestic U.S. airlines ( with little international experience ) the lion 's share . Thus General Arnold has already built up the weapon to smash Pan Am 's grip on world routes . <P> A Fire under CAB . Why is General Arnold suddenly so interested in postwar air competition ? One likely reason : the Army has decided that the more U.S. companies operate air routes to foreign countries , the better the Army will be equipped to handle postwar emergencies .
