txt BIPARTISAN FIGHT TO UNIFY MILITARY GAINS UNDER CRISIS Senator Thomas- of Utah Says He Will Back GOP to Limit on Merger Program HINTS MORE MINORITY AID Gurney Declares Hearings on Plan Will Be Speeded , With Training Action to Follow By WILLIAM S. WHITE Special to ME New YOMIS Timms . WASHINGTON , March 14 ? The bipartisan campaign for urgent action toward unification of the armed forces , already forwarded by the atmosphere of crisis concerning the Mediterranean , gained powerful adherents in Congress today . Senator Elbert D. Thomas , who headed the old Military Affairs Committee in the last Congress and was a co-author of an unsuccessful merger bill last session , took the floor in a major speech to pledge " to the limit " his aid to the present Republican leaders on military legislation . In the present Senate , the new amalgamated Committee on the Armed Services , which supervises the whole military establishment , ' land , sea and air , has the unification issue in charge and will open ' hearings next Tuesday . To Senator Chan Gurney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee , Senator Thomas , a Democrat of Utah , publicly promised , not only " whatever service I can offer , " but inferentially the help of some of his senior Democratic colleagues . Hill Joins With Thomas By way of adding to the data of the Armed Services Committee , Mr. Thomas offered for himself and for Senator Lister Hill , Democrat , of Alabama , another old Military Affairs Committee member , the final draft of the merger measure which failed in the last Congress . " Congress can not now escape the responsibility of deciding , and deciding soon , what sort of military organization we are to have , " Senator Thomas told his colleagues . Speaking as a member who , in the days of Democratic control , // was the most influential man in Congress on military legislation , he added , " Congress in the Reorganization Act ( which consolidated the Military and Naval Affairs Committees in both Houses ) has already taken action toward unification of the services . " Actual service unification , he said , " inevitably would follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the midst of the late war , " he observed , " both services wanted unification , because of the striking necessity for it . " In an analysis of the provisions of last session 's bill , which like the present one had the backing of the White House , Mr. Thomas observed that many of its principles had been brought forward into the present measure . Education Agency Is *Urged He raised some objection to what he termed a " most important omission , " in the lack of any present provision for a special Education and Training Agency in the proposed military establishment , He asserted , too , that the new bill offered the possibility of a " break in the line " of all-civilian direction , from the President downward . Nevertheless , he declared : " The reorganization and unification of the War and Navy Departments is essential both for peace and war , and especially essential if our country is to meet all its obligations under world organization , and its obligations in connection with the peace and the maintenance of the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions , " he asserted . " The vital thing , " he went on , " is that we bring about unification at the first opportunity and that we do it before our experiences in the war are forgotten and before those who have guided us in the war have ceased to be in positions of leadership in our nation . This is probably a now-or-never bill . " While Mr. Thomas was stressing economy as an effect of a service merger , Senator Gurney said off the floor that the bill 's advocates would lean heavily on the contention that an " economy of men " also would result . Four Weeks of Hearings Likely " It is easy to establish " he added , " that with unification the total number of men needed for the military establishment in any given situation would be less than would be needed without unification . " Senator Gurney disclosed that he expected to complete the hearings within four weeks , and perhaps in three , and then to proceed to the issue of universal military training .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
