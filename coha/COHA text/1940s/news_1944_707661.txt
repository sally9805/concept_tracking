txt IFARTHUR , STASSEN CAN BE NOMINATED UNDER NEW RULING But a Regular Officer Must Not Himself Seek to Be Picked by a Party , Army and Navy Say ROOSEVELT TELLS OF PACT ' Reserves Can File as Candidates but All in Service Are Barred From Campaigning By CHARLES HI RD Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . IWASHINGTON , March 10 ? , Regular officers 43f the armed services can accept such nominations for political office as come to them without solicitation by themselves , according to an interpretation of regulations announced today by President Roosevelt . This means that Gen. Douglas would be eligible to run for the Presidency if selected by a convention , but would not be able to authorize the use of his name on primary ballots or in any pre-convention activity . In contrast to this ruling on regular officers , reserve officers will be permitted to file as candidates in the pre-convention period . Lieut . Comdr . Harold Stassen , former Governor of Minnesota and also prominently mentioned for a Presidential nomination , is General 's counterpart in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President in a statement embodying a joint Army and Navy agreement signed by Secretary Stimson and Secretary Knox . In actual practice political observers here believe that the distinction between regular and reserve officers is without much importance . Restrictions on Campaigning General 's sponsors have been championing his candidacy without public word from the general and Commander Stassen has consistently refused to take an active part on his own behalf . Otherwise these two possible candidates for the Presidency , and any other officers who might be named for similar or subsidiary positions , are under the same restrictions . None may take time out from military duties to devote to politics and none may perform duties to which he may be elected while he remains on active service . Neither can the officers make speeches or conduct election campaigns while on active duty . If elected to office , national or State , any officer will be retired or honorably discharged , according to the type and length of his service . The position of regular officers is set by a law which specifically prohibits any such officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in civilian life while performing military duties . The Army-Navy agreement added : " A member of the regular components of the land or naval forces , while on active duty , may accept a nomination for public office , provided such nomination is tendered without direct or indirect activity or solicitation on his part . He may then file such evidence of his candidacy as is required by local law . " This was taken to mean that if the Republican National Convention should nominate General he could then comply with formalities necessary to put his name on State ballots . Since reserve officers have essentially a civilian status , it was ruled that these , " while on active duty may become candidates for // WARTHUR , STASSEN CAN BE NOMINATED1 // election to public office without the tender of nomination . " The limitations imposed on both regular and reserve officer candidates require that the candidacy must not interfere with the performance by the individual concerned of his duties , that the individual concerned . if elected , " will not at any time , while in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holder of the office , or perform any of the duties thereof . " Agreement on Presidency The Army and Navy agree specifically to release from active duty anyone elected to the Presidency , while stating that it is " mandatory " for any officer elected to the United States Senate or House to leave the armed services if he accepts such a Congressional position . Officers eligible for retirement would , under these conditions , be retired ; holders of reserve commissions dated prior to Sept. 16 , 1940 , would be returned to " inactive status , " while " all other persons shall be discharged , relieved from active duty or permitted to resign , as appropriate . " Strict rules governing the conduct of candidates of all categories and all members of the armed forces in connection with politics state : " No member of the land or naval forces , while on active duty , will use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the course or outcome thereof . " They will not be permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Following is the text of the statement by President Roosevelt and the joint Army-Navy agreement which he approved : I have approved a joint ArmyNavy agreement regarding the participation of members of the armed services in political campaigns .
