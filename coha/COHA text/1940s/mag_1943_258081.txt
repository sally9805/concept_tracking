The Swedish liner Gripsholm stood ready for another errand of mercy . Into her hold went medicine , clothing , cigarets , food packed by Red Cross volunteers who worked day &; night shifts . Aboard went the pathetic little gifts , prepared with great hope and sorrow , by the families of the American men &; women who are spending the war in Japanese prison camps . <P> Ahead of the Gripsholm lies a long , weary journey . Not until Oct. 15 will she cast anchor in the Zuary River , inside the hilly coastline of Goa in Portuguese India . <P> There she will meet the Japanese Keta Maru , which in better days flew the French flag as the Aramis . She will ex change cargoes - and above all civilian prisoners of war . <P> If the Gripsholm 's returning passengers are lucky , they will be home - after " two years ' imprisonment - by December . Of the 8,500 Americans interned in the Far East , only 1,250 can get aboard the ship . <P> The able-bodied must stay behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged , the ill , 300 children . They will require care : besides its load of toys for the children , the Gripsholm will carry four doctors , eight nurses . <P> Since the wheels of communication between nations at war turn slowly , this will be the first exchange of prisoners and gifts since last August . One cause of the long delay : Japan 's insistence on the return of a selected list of her citizens interned in the U.S.-many of whom flatly refused the opportunity .
