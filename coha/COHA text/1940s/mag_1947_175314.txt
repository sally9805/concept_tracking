The patient diggers of the American School of Classical Studies last week finished their twelfth season of rooting into ancient Athens . They had concentrated on the Agora , or central public square , one of the oldest continually inhabitated spots on earth . Beneath the Agora , history and prehistory lie in deep-stacked layers . All the great trends in civilization have touched this enchanted area , as they are touching it now . <P> Beneath the remains of classical Athens , the diggers found two Mycenaean tombs hacked in the living rock . The tombs contained three skeletons , two long bronze swords , other weapons and delicately wrought ornaments of the Age of Bronze . Judging by these remains , the diggers believe that the tombs date from 1400 B.C. At that period , ancient Greece was not yet Greece , for the real Greeks had not swept down in numbers from Thessaly in the north . Athens was probably a small city subject to great Mycenae , itself an outpost of the strange , semi-Egyptian civilization which centered on the island of Crete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School hopes to build , the diggers found a treasure which looked like a page from a history book . Thrown away and buried deep were several hundred ostraka-bits of broken pottery on which Athenian voters once wrote the names of public men they wished to elect or to exile . Among the names on exile ballots were three which still echo in history : Themistocles , Hippocrates , and Aristides . <P> In ancient , filled-up wells , the diggers ' spades found stone heads from the great periods of Greek sculpture . One , of a 4th Century woman , had been completely gilded , probably by some tasteless Roman . <P> Out of the hallowed ground came humbler things , too . The ruins of an old Greek drugstore had urns marked " purgative " and " wine " wine sweetened sweetened with honey . " A fragment of pottery ( which the Greeks used as scratch paper ) bore the curt instruction : " Leave the saw under the threshold . " The diggers have already figured out how the Acropolis ( citadel ) of Athens looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models ( see cut . But there is still much work to be done in and under the Agora . The diggers think that they have chores to keep them busy for the next 16 years . By then they hope to tell the whole story of how ancient Athens looked and lived throughout its long , important past .
