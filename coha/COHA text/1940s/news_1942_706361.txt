txt Special Cable to Tay NEW YORE TIMES : LONDON , April ** naval units guarding the sea approaches to India have been depleted further , the Admiralty announced today . Already weakened in that sector of the world-wide struggle for mastery of the seas by the loss of two badly needed heavy cruisers , the Royal Navy has now lost the 10,850-ton aircraft carrier Hermes to Japanese planes in the Indian Ocean . Dive-bombers got the 18-yearold floating airport . She is the latest casualty in the titanic struggle that is going on in those far-off seas for control of lanes of communication vital to the strategy of the United Nations . This loss , like that of the cruisers Dorsetshire and Cornwall , announced yesterday , has been sustained without the fighting of a battle in the old sense of the word in naval warfare .

In contrast to Tokyo 's acknowledged loss of ten planes , the British said they had shot down seventy-five that participated in raids on Colombo and Trincomalee since last Sunday . A British communiqu ? issued at Colombo announced that twenty-one Japanese planes had been destroyed for certain on Thursday in the enemy raid on Trincomalee , that twelve other planes probably had been destroyed and two more had been damaged , The Associated Press reported . However , there remained little doubt that Japanese surface warships and submarines had taken a heavy toll of merchant ships in the Bay of Bengal . Survivors of a group of ships sunk in convoy off the Orissa coast of India have arrived in port and told their stories .

The carrier , which has gone the same way as the Courageous , the Glorious and the Ark Royal , was the first of those designed , from the time her keel was laid down , for her special mission . It was not known here tonight whether the Hermes had the cover of shore-based fighters when she was sunk east of Ceylon , seventy miles south of Trincomalee . It was said that it might have been that the fighter forces were heavily engaged in driving off the Japanese raiders at the naval base at the time the Hermes was sunk . ?
