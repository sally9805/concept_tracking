As Tchaikovsky 's 1812 Overture boomed to its finish last week in St.Louis ' Convention Hall , an audience of 9,000 leaped to its feet and looked nervously for the nearest exit . Amid the pealing of Moscow 's bells and the surging of God Save the Czar , two shotguns had belched fire and smoke behind the scenes of the St. Louis Symphony . The shooting was merely part of an old Muscovite custom . <P> Ever since Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky included an obbligato for cannon in its tumultuous score , the 1812 Overture has been considered something to shoot about . <P> The late John Philip Sousa did it with bombs and giant firecrackers . His predecessor , redoubtable Bandmaster Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore , cracked plaster from the ceiling of many a U.S. auditorium with a battery of real cannon manned by a squad of U.S. artillerymen . In Madison Square Garden , six years ago , Conductor Erno Rapee added a squad of infantry and a ten-gauge cannon to his WPA orchestra of 210 men , made enough noise to rock midtown Manhattan . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vladimir Golschmahn . Promising in his program that he would perform the overture so stirringly that the audience would " literally be lifted from their seats , " Conductor Golschmann ransacked nearby army camps for artillery . He found plenty of cannon , but no blank shells . At last Conductor Golschmann settled for a couple of shotguns which he borrowed from the Schubert Theater 's property manager , Eugene Popp . They were " fired by stage mechanics into empty wooden tubs . St. Louis Symphony patrons agreed that the popping of Popp 's shotguns was noise enough .
