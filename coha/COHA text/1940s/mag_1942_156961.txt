The days of Darwin when the church attacked the teachings of science are long since past , but last week the old argument was revived-this time by Julian Huxley , grandson of Darwin 's great interpreter Thomas Huxley . <P> The truce between religion and science has been based on the assumption of both most churchmen and most scientists that religion and science are separate realms , that the truth of God and the truth of the scientific world are complementary . Last spring FORTUNE published four philosophical articles by four learned professors , all of them expounding this view in one form or another . <P> Biologist Julian Huxley , agreeing with none of them , asked leave to reply and does so in the December FORTUNE . His reply directly challenges those who try philosophically to reconcile science and religion . Presenting a coherent philosophy of man 's object in life , he makes the flat assertions that : <P> Body and soul are not separate entities but two aspects of one organization . . . . Matter and mind are two aspects of one reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural that has not been understood , in part an invention of human fantasy , in part the unknowable . <P> Man must not attempt to put off any of his burden of responsibility on to the shoulders of outside powers . <P> More Science . Huxley 's answer to the argument that science is insufficient to man 's needs and aspirations is to demand more science : " When men assert that the scientific approach is incomplete it is because they have not been willing to follow it to its final conclusion , or because they are mistaking an early stage in its growth for full development . " <P> Science , Huxley points out , began with the simpler phenomena ; its first triumphs were in mechanics and simple ! physics ; chemistry took another century . " The central fact of biology , evolution was not established until modern science had been in existence for over two hundred years . ... In the same way the science of mind developed later than biological science . What Newton was for mechanics and physics , and Darwin for biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminating way of thinking . " <P> The World Stuff . Huxley flatly rejects the philosophic dualism which divides truth into two kinds , scientific and revealed . He declares that the world , living and lifeless , mental and physical , is composed of one stuff . " In reproduction there is no moment at which life enters . . . the offspring is merely a detached portion of the parental living substance . " <P> Dualists have classically insisted that . a dead man differs from a live one by the loss of a soul . But , says Huxley , a dead body is not the same as a living body , the chemical conditions are different : " If you substitute oil for acid in the battery of your automobile , no current will pass . " The electric eel can light a lamp ; less visible , but none the less real are the currents which accompany all vital activity . In the same manner , " all the activities of the world stuff are accompanied by mental as well as material happenings . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
