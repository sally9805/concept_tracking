txt The feel of climax is in the air . High tension at half a dozen different points at once indicates that we are nearing another explosive point in the war . During the long pause between the Polish campaign and the attack on France a high Nazi official told the Writer in Berlin that this struggle would be marked by spurts and thins , alternating periods of intense activity and exhaustion . He said the pattern would be different from that of previous contests , because modern weapons made static fronts impossible , and the mechanical and physical effort expended in each drive would require intervals for recharging and repair . So far the tidal movement of the struggle has borne out his forecast . The military battles have been brief and violent episodes in a war of political , economic and moral pressures . But the Nazi spokesman did not say that each wave of assault would have to be stronger and bigger than the preceding . Doubtless he thought the movement would be diminuendo rather than crescendo . The enemies were to be picked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone that the lightest blow would finish it off . Exactly the contrary process has taken place . Each fresh assault , instead of calling for less force , demands an enormous increase of strength . Look at the picture today and you see that the area of high pressure is not only in Russia . Unrest in France has reached a pitch where it has to be suppressed by terror . It has become so dangerous and widespread that the conquerors have to find a scapegoat . So they do what they did in Germany , round up thousands of people in a working-class district of Paris  --  formerly Communist and probably now following the party line  --  and call . them " Jews , " although every Parisian knows that almost no Jews live in the Bastille quarter . On a smaller scale the same thing is happening in Rumania , Croatia , CzechoSlovakia , Holland . Occupied Europe is seething . Instead of uniting the Continent in an anti-Red campaign , as Hitler hoped , the invasion of Russia has stirred up all the underground opposition , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force so active it can no longer be concealed and is labeled " Jewish " to hide its real character . There is crisis in Europe . There is crisis in Iran , where all signs point to the imminent opening of a new fighting front . A test of the intentions of Japan approaches as the first American shipload of munitions to Russia draws closer to Vladivostok . There is a sense of crisis in Washington as the President speaks more urgently of danger , and the assorted tensions of the widening war multiply the questions and demands that press upon this government . All the answers hang on the Battle of Russia . Hitler is hurrying on that murderous front . He is racing against time , against Winter , against action in the Middle East that threatens to block his way to the Caucasus , against the gathering chaos of Europe , against the accelerating pace of American production . The great spurt now at We breaking point represents a climax more momentous than those that have gone before , because the Germans have staked everything on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a chance to do more than hold the line . They have a chance to hitch the Nazi dynamo to the " impossible static front " while they strike in other directions . One can only guess at Hitler 's aims in Russia , but the first thrust of the campaign indicated that he intended to drive through to Moscow , probably with the idea of destroying his friend Stalin and establishing in the Kremlin a government subservient to himself . Had he succeeded in that plan the rest of European Russia would have fallen into his hands without the foot-by-foot struggle he is now engaged in . Supposing that the tough resistance he encountered , the unexpected power of Stalin to rally his people to the furious defense of their soil , caused Hitler to revise his strategy , the alternative would be the move he is making now . He would fight to seal up Russia , close her sea outlets north and south , cut her off from Europe , and this he will accomplish if he takes Leningrad and the ports on the Black Sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded old capital where the Workers ' Revolution began . Peter the Great opened too wide his " window on the west . " He built a western city in the swamps of the Neva , a kind of imperial Washington with wide squares and classic facades , and gathered so many laborers there that it became a breeding place of discontent and conspiracies . There the Bolsheviks , a little group of " westerners " whose revolution was as un-Russian as Leningrad itself , were planted by the Germans in the last war , and there , by a strange irony , comes the leader of the counter-revolution on a message of destruction . Neither Leningrad nor Odessa is as important as Moscow , and if the Red Army can make a stand with fresh forces at any point west of Moscow , as the Germans begin to hint they will , the decisive battle for time can be won . On the other hand , possession of the western approaches to the Soviet Unionwill enable the Germans to control the Dardanelles and open the way to the battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harder campaign . The climax now developing is only the prologue to the next .
