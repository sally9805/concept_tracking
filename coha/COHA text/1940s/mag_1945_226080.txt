Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Quisling was awakened at 2 a.m. and hurried from his cell to a square in Oslo 's somber Akershus Fortress . Awaiting him were a clergyman , a state prosecutor and a firing squad , an officer and ten men . No photographers , no reporters recorded his last abasement or his last heroics . <P> At 2:40 , the officer commanded : " Fyr ! " The ten soldiers obeyed . <P> Thus died the man whose name had become a worldwide synonym for traitor . The police had to keep the ashes of his cremated body ; his native village refused to accept them for burial .
