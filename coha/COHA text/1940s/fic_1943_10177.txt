THE FOREST AND THE FORTexcept for one lock that grew from the middle scalp , which Mawakisgreased with bear 's fat and wrapped about near the base with twine . It looked like a little sheaf of wheat left alone when the field has been gleaned . After that , when the fuzz came , Kaysinatashaved his head . That hurt at first , and so he remembered . And one thing more about that time or later . Kaysinata put him in a canoe and paddled up the Ohio to Logstown . Logstown was an even bigger village than Sacunk . There were many Indian children there from various tribes and he played with them and swam in the river . They spoke several tribal tongues . Their people had come to get powder and little rolls of lead for the summer hunting from a French half-breed trader named Chartier . But there was an Englishman there , too . His name was Gist . He stayed for two days only . TIe was afraid . The French would have had him killed or taken prisoner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Long Knives , and Kaysinata would have none of it . Gist spoke secretly to the Little Turtle . The boy was glad to hear his own tongue again . Gist asked him his name , and who his parents were . Salathiel thought awhile and told him . Gist bade him remember them when he said his prayers . He would have ransomed the boy from the Big Turtle , if he had had any goods with him . But he had none . He was on a mission from the governor of Virginiato spy out the land for the Ohio Company . He went across the river in a canoe in the night . llut Salathiel remembered . It made an impression on him . For a long time he secretly said the prayer his mother had taught him , and told the names of his parents to God . After a long while the words grew dim . They became little more than a noise that he made to himself in his head . At length he thought he forgot . The Big Turtle was angry when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . lie took loin to the river and ducked him . He held him long under the water . ' then he had him painted brown , blue , and red . He put a line new doeskin shirt on him that Mawakis had made , and he showed him at the council lire . All the Indians , and he himself , saw that he was now indeed the Little Turtle , and one of the Sawanos , the people who came from the south . This was after they returned to Sacunk . Soon after that they went hunting . It was the first time . They hunted beaver that summer . The Little Turtle learned all about beavers . He was badly bitten by a pup . The scar on his thumb remained . Every summer the tribe scattered . They left their winter cabins in the trading villages by the river and became separate lodges , OF OLD FORGOTTEN THINGS 41hunting where they listed , as long as they did n't interfere with one another . For the most part the Shawnees wandered west , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , empty of men , but full of game . They sought buffalo and elk there in the bluegrass glades . Even the boys shot deer . Once they were ambushedby Catawbas . Kaysinata killed two of them and took their scalps . One summer the whole tribe went and camped at the DeTroit . The Little Turtle saw many white men 's houses there , and the great barns along the river between the two lakes , like the street of a town . He saw an ox again . The French officers at the fort kindled the council fire often . Their chief was called de Bienville . There were many speeches , and much rum flowed . There were drinking clubs amongst the lodges , and people ran about screaming . They shot guns off and wounded one another . They fought with knives and several were killed . It was hard for the chiefs to keep the peace among the tribes . The French were persuading the Shawnees to take up the hatchet against the Dawn Land people . Kaysinata was gloomy and sad . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great council fire at Philadelphia . There were too many of them to fight , he said . Let them trade . Their goods were cheaper and better than those of the French . Many gifts were showered upon him by the French to make him change his mind . That was a bad summer for old people and children at the DeTroit . Mawakis was drunk most of the time . She grew bleareyedand fat . Her teeth loosened . She beat the Little Turtle often , until the Big Turtle beat her . Kaysinata hated the firewater and the wars that the French would kindle against the English and the six fires of the Long House . He was a hunter . His half-brother Nymwha was a prophet . Nymwha made medicine with tobacco , killikinick , feathers , and the shoulder blades of deer . He foretold disaster to the Shawnees from the wars of the palefaces . He tried to persuade his people to leave the DeTroit , to give up guns and firewater , to hunt with bow and arrow again , and to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were accursed , said Nymwha . All the gifts of the paleface were poison to the Indian , he said . ' I'lhcy laughed at him . The tribes from the north across the great lake danced the war dance . They danced all summer , and drank . They often went mad and killed one another . There was no hunting . There would be no42 THE FOREST AND THE FORTfood in the fall . The French would have to feed them , and they would have to take up the hatchet for the French . Kaysinata believed Nymwha . He also saw things with his fathers ' eyes . It was a bad summer . Even the children ran wild . The squaws drove them from the lodges . They shifted for themselves , all but the very little ones , whom Father Bonnecamp brought to the fort and baptized . It never occurred to the Little Turtle to take refuge with the French . He remembered in the back of his mind he was once an Englishman and the French were his enemies , although he now thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a big boy , and strong . He spoke the chief 's Shawnee well , and he could talk in several other tongues , and the sign language . He and some other youngsters stole a birchbark canoe from the Ottawas , who were drinking brandy from kegs with wooden dippers . There was a hole in the canoe , but they repaired it . They spent the summerfishing and gathering berries . They camped on islands in the lake , and built fires . Rattlesnakes bit two of them and they died . Once the woods burned while they slept and they took to the lake just in time , with their eyebrows burned off . A Huron boy called Speckled Snake was drowned . Before autumn came Kaysinata and Nymwha took their squaws and lodges away early from the I ) e ' 1'roit . They took the fine clothes , the brass kettles , the paints and vermilion , and the wheat flour and lead they had received from the French , and headed south across country for the Beautiful River . All their furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had died . They stole horses from the Mingoes , and hunted to lay in food for the winter . There would be no corn that year for hominy . None had been planted . They smoked fish , and dried berries . They . took bears and fat raccoons . They worked the squaws hard . They struck the stream called Beaver and followed it south till they came to the Beautiful River again . I gut that autumn they did not go back to Sacunk . They settled for the winter at Iogstown on the banks of the Beautiful River . The French soldiers came soon after and built them log huts and stone chimneys , and they lived there that winter on the bounty of the French . Kaysinata had at last been persuaded to take up the hatchet against the English . Nemacolin , the Delaware , who lived near the fort of the Old People at Red Stone , came and told him he had shown the English the Old Buffalo trail over the mountains , through the Great and Little Meadows . The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Stone . The Long Knives were already there . Next year they would build a fort at the GreatOF OLD FORGOTTEN THINGS 43Forks . The Six Nations had sold the English land south of the Ohio . Kaysinata was very angry at this news . He feared the English more than the French . When the English came they cut down the trees , made houses , and stayed . Soon the hunting grounds would be full of English all along the Beautiful River . So the Big Turtle listened to the French . The Little Turtle heard all this talk , sitting in the cabins at Logstown . He filled the pipes of the chiefs . He blew smoke in their faces to be polite . He was growing tall now . He listened with open ears . Mawakis was losing her teeth . She sat in the lodge , and slept often . Soon she would be old . In the chief 's hut there was always much meat , gifts , and food . Kaysinata and Nymwha were the best hunters of all the Shawnees . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They spoke of it together at night . The Little Turtle listened . He grew tall and fierce . His hands and feet were large . He played with Indian boys older than he was . He made them afraid of him . He was the chief 's son . The Big Turtle taught him how to wrestle and strike out with both hands and feet , like the half-breed Frenchmen . He taught him how to skin beasts , and how to throw the knife and the hatchet . His bow of arc wood had once been a warrior 's . It came from the Illinois . The Little Turtle was the only boy who could bend it . He was taller now than the bow . That winter , about the time the ice formed , two Englishmen came to Logstown . Shingas , the Delaware chief , brought them . One was a tall , young man with a pink face and his hair tied back in a queue . He was a Long Knife and brought with him an interpreter called " David 's son " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young man talked . He also sent for Tanacharison , the half-king , who was away hunting . He came and talked with the tall man secretly in his tent . Then there was a great council of the Delawares , Shawnees , and Mingoes held at the council house . The Little Turtle heard English talked again between David 's son and the Long Knife . He told all that passed to Kaysinata , who sat and said nothing . The Long Knife wanted guides and an escort to the French captain at Venango . He had come to warn the French to leave the country . Kaysinata laughed . " It 's lead will do the talking , " he said to Nymwha . He would not let the Little Turtle speak to the Englishmen . Shingas , Tanacharison , Jeskakake , White Thunder , and the Ilunter went with the Long Knife , Wash'ton , and David 's son to Venango . They were not seen again . " There will be war now between the palefaces , " said Nymwha. 44 THE FOREST AND THE FORT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive them out . One paleface is as bad as another . Let the hatchet bite deep . " In the early spring Kaysinata needed horses . He stole two from the English at their fort near Red Stone . He stole another from an Englishman named Frazier at the mouth of Turtle Creek , on the Monongahela . The Little Turtle lifted that horse . First he went close to the cabin . He heard the man Frazier saying goddamn to his wife . She was angry , and poured water on the fire . Then the Little Turtle caught the horse and just rode away while no one was looking . He was very proud . He said goddamn to the horse , like Mr. Frazier , and it went faster . He named the horse that . The French laughed , but not for long , for Nymwha stole three horses from them at Venango . He cut off their manes and dyed them with walnut juice so that they would not be recognized . The two lodges went far up the Beaver and made sugar from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west on a great hunting . They ranged along the Ohio , clear out to the Big Miami . They caught catfish and shot ducks and swans . They ate beaver and buffalo and venison . Kaysinata and his half-brother Nymwha hunted together . They pitched their lodges side by side . There were four squaws in Nymwha 's lodge . All his children had been daughters . They were strong . That was why Kaysinata hunted with Nymwha . Mawakis was no longer much good to Kaysinata . Her front teeth were worn down and loosened from chewing deerskins for his shirts . She could no longer make them soft for him . She was full of miseries , and longed for firewater to feel young again . Kaysinata wanted much dried fish and jerked buffalo meat . He brought in many animals to skin . There must be dried berries and pemmican for the winter . The corn must be ground , and the hominy stamped . The fires were to be tended . Nymwha 's squaws could do the work . Ile and the Big Turtle still insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wish to sell themselves to the French and the traders just for a little food . They worked the women hard . Nymwha watched his squaws carefully . He would not let his daughters marry . He made bad medicine and prophesied they would give birth to snakes . He scared the young men and drove them away . The three big girls bothered the Little Turtle . They once caught him in swimming and found he was not a full man yet and made fun of him . He hated them . When he grew larger he made them afraid of him . He beat them with Nymwha 's stick . He never spoke to them again , except to tell them to bring him something . OF OLD FORGOTTEN THINGS 45They made moccasins for him , and grunted . They were named after the three winds . It was different with Mawakis . The Big Turtle did not abuse her . He simply disregarded her as she grew old . She stumbled after him through the forest when they made a march , carrying what she could on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening fire for Kaysinata . The Little Turtle would do that . He also brought her things to eat and she gradually became quite dependent upon him . Once he was gone a week and stole a little horse for her from the Twigtees . Nymwha praised him for going far away to steal . Kaysinata said nothing . Sometimes he gave Mawakis tobacco to smoke . There was an affection between the Little Turtle and Mawakis . She was the only being who loved him for himself . She had tried to be a mother to him . Had it not been for her , he might have forgotten his own mother entirely . Sometimes Mawakis would squat close to him in the half-lodge at evening while Kaysinata smoked and they looked into the fire . She would stroke his cheek with her old , roughened fingers . Then he would think of the fire in the cabin and the old days that were now like a dream . At such times Nymwha made medicine and talked with his great-grandfathers . Animals looked at them from the trees with red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come upon the white shoulder blades of the deer with which he prophesied . They clicked together in the ancient box of hardwood that had come from the south . There were other things in the box . Once a year Nymwha blew upon the conch shell , which was also there , and burnt tobacco to celebrate the day the Sawanos had come from their far island in the south . All the voices from the past were sad now , he said . He drank the bitter drink , and dreamed dreams . Sometimes he danced and once he frothed at the mouth . To all this Kaysinata said nothing , but he listened to Nymwha and believed him . Many evenings Mawakis sat looking into the fire and told the Little Turtle of her girlhood in the happy valley east of the mountains . Those were good times , she said . The paleface was far away in the dawnlight then . The spotted sickness slept . Kaysinata agreed , and told stories himself . He , too , longed to return to the good valley between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juniata . He made the Little Turtle learn by heart the names of the places where his grandfathers slept along the streams in that valley . He taught him the signs of the hills and the stars by which to find them . There was a song about them and46 THE FOREST AND THE FORTtheir sleeping places which all the squaws sang . It was so old some of the words could no longer be explained . It was old , old medicine . But for the most part the Little Turtle was lonely in the forest on those western huntings , even when Nymwha 's lodge was along . There were no companions for the Little Turtle , no young men or boys in the party . Kaysinata and Nymwha worked him hard . All day they taught him many things . But they would not let him go to the villages of other tribes alone . Nor would they smoke with him . " Women and tobacco are for men , " they said . " You are tall , but you are not yet a man . Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . War is coming . " So , because of that , the forests and the long stretches of the Beautiful River were lonely to the boy . He was grave and sad in the summer . He was glad when they turned back as the first leaves began to fall . They had wandered far . They marched back eastwardunder the great trees for a score of days . The moon changed from little to full . At night they came out on bottom lands where there was good grass , and there they camped . The trail was made that way . The horses grazed under the stars and the Little Turtle watched them . All day under the trees the rut of the trace ran eastward through the forest . In some places it was waist-deep , worn by moccasinsthat had passed going and coming , no one knew how long . At night it usually led out under the stars again . Then it was that they hobbled the horses and camped near running water . They came back to the Beaver Creek well and strong that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pelts and deerskins . Even Mawakis was better . There had been no firewater . On the banks of the Beaver Creek the tribe gathered . There were many villages there of several tribes . In the autumn the traders came with goods and rum . And it was then that the fun began , and the trouble too . Kaysinata , however , would buy no firewater that year . He traded all his deerskins and the heaver pelts for guns , powder , flints , and clothes . Then he took the best horses and went away with six other warriors to raid the English east of the mountains . It was good raiding weather . It was fine Indian summer . And Nymwha 's saying had come true . There was war . The French had struck the English and finished the fort at the Great Forks , which the English had begun . They called that fort " Due-kane . " They gathered the warriors there . The squaws and youngsters were left alone on the Beaver , except for the old men . And there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year the bad trouble began . The tribes began toOF OLD FORGOTTEN THINGS 47break up . Many warriors who went to raid never returned . Many more were away loafing at the fort at the Great Forks most of the time . Few cared to hunt while the French fed them . There was small work done in the villages by the squaws . Sometimes even the fires went out . Plunder , firewater , and some captives began to arrive . Everything was plentiful but food . But no one ate much . They drank . When the firewater ran out , a kind of coma succeeded the long delirium . Nothing was as it once had been . Life in the villages of the Mingoes and the Shawnees along the Beaver Creek was haggard and miserable . The squaws sold themselves to strangers and French soldiers for a little food . The chiefs were at the fort talking with the French . They were going to drive the English into the salty lake , they said . Nymwha had foretold all this . He had seen something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high rocks on the south side of the Beautiful River , just a little downstream from Fort Duquesne . There he camped in an inaccessible gorge which led to the top of the cliff . There was a hill near by that swarmed with turkeys . Only officers could land near the rocks . He required considerable gifts for them . His daughters were happy , and there was great plenty in the lodge , and no trouble . Nymwha hid an English trader near the rocks and kept him till he could go east . That man 's name was McKee . Nymwha gave McKee wampum to take back to the English and told him consoling speeches to say to their chief men . He saw many bad pictures on the shoulder blades of deer when he made medicine now , but he said nothing about them to the French . " Let the hatchet fall on many , " he said . " Who would be a paleface ? They live only to feel themselves . They destroy all that the Manitous have made . They are right when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them . " The Little Turtle found life in the village on Beaver Creek difficult while the Big Turtle was away . He took a canoe and went to see his uncle Nymwha , at McKees Rocks . He told him that Kaysinatahad returned from raiding , but was still at the fort . Mawakis was hungry and there was little game to be had . Life was bad in the villages . At first Nymwha said nothing . He smoked for a long time . He looked at the boy keenly . Then for the first time he passed the pipe to his nephew , the Little Turtle , who also now blew the smoke out through his nose . " Now , " said Nymwha , " listen like a man . These things are but the beginning of wisdom " : THE FOREST AND THE FORTGo alone , go with one other , or go with many . Never go with two ; one of them will prove an enemy .

He believed in his medicine whether it promised him good or ill . Through all the great war between the French and English he lived in the high gorge near McKees Rocks in the way his ancestors had lived before him . He hunted . Save for a few French officers who came for a while to visit his daughters , no one else had come there . The country to the south of the Beautiful River was deserted now because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forks the tribes gathered to help the French meet the English . All the warriors were gone from the Beaver . It was lean times there in the villages of old men , women , and children . Most of the Delawares , the Wyandots , the Twigtees , the Shawnees , and the tribes from the north were gathered at the fort . A great army of the British , Red Coats and Long Knives with cannon , were coming over the mountains . All men , even the Long House , waited to see which way the hatchet would fall . The music played , and cannon were fired often at the fort . The banks of the three rivers there , and the islands , were lined with the watch fires of many warriors . The Little Turtle climbed the high rocks near Nymwha 's camp to look at them . At night he could look upriverpast an island and see the red glow of the fires of the warriors pictured in the water and the sky . Mawakis and the Little Turtle had come to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , much food , and contentment at his snug bark lodges in the gorge . Even the French officers did not come any more as battle drew near them. 4950 THE FOREST AND THE FORT And two of the squaws had babies now . The papooses hung strapped to boards under the trees . They seldom cried . They hung there silent , and looked about them with big brown eyes . They were as fond of honeycomb as young bear cubs . They would suck it from your finger . Mawakis made much of them . She grew better after she had once been chased by snakes . There was nothing to drink in Nym- wha 's gorge but cold water from the spring . Many canoes passed up and down the river far below , but none landed to speak with Nymwha . He was content . " They will find trouble both ways , " he said . He and the Little Turtle smoked together , while the women chewed deerskins . Nymwha once spoke at night of the far-off past : Many , many bead strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great island in the broad water in the south . The trees and the animals were different there . The fruits and nuts rained upon the earth constantly , for there were no seasons . The sun stood still in heaven and no winter came . There were great fish in the lake that was salty and lay all along beneath the heaven of stars . Out of it came the sun and moon , and into it the sun went at evening . The Sawanos were a mighty people in that island . The y blew u on conch shells , the fished , and they fou ht with other Indians who came from the far south to eat them . They conquered in battle . But mostly they were peaceful . They waxed fat ; grew old . They died of old age and innocence . Then in an evil day came the paleface out of the dawn- light .

Then a great medicine man arose in the tribe of the Sawanos . He was greater and wiser than the chiefs . He was a fisherman . He had a broken back , and a large head . A fish had eaten his foot . But he spoke the truth . " Come , " HOW NYMWHA BLEW ON A CONCH SHELL 51he said . " I will show you a great island across the deep water . I have been there . It is where the sun goes in the night .

They took white clay and made their canoes the color of moonlight . They paddledafter the crookbacked man . After two nights they came to the great island where the alligators roared and there were turkeys and deer . They raised their lodges besidethe great water . Then the fisherman said , " Blow once every summer on this conch shell in the same moon that you have safely landed . Then your grandfathers in the old island will know their children are still here . And forget not to do it , or it will be the end of you .

They followed the trails of deer and buffalo into52 THE FOREST AND THE FORT the sunset till they came to the great , blue mountains where the smoke stands out from the high hills at morning like an arm with a broad hand on it . There they fought with a fierce people called the Cherokees , who have lived in those hills since the beginning . And they fled before them northward and westward into a fat but empty land . There was nothing but animals in that country . Only the Old People had lived there long ago . They were giants . It was they who built the forts shaped like serpents out of mud and stones , but no man had seen them . No one remembered who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those battles were also sore . So they came north again through the great hills into the country where the rain turned white in the winter , and a rumour came that the Espanioles were behind them . They blew upon the conch shell and communed with the ghosts of their grandfathers in the old island . But what the ghosts said no one could now be sure . So the Sawanos made friends with the Delawares , the First Corners into the land , who were a mighty people in those days . They blew upon the conch shell and told the ghosts of their old grandfathers that now they had new grandfathers in the new island , and their names were those of the Delawares , and they begged their new grand- fathers for land to hunt in and to build their lodges in , and be at peace . And that land the Delawares gave them . It was on the rivers that run into the Great Bay . Yet there was no peace for the Sawanos , whom men now call the Shawanees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from their grand- fathers , the Delawares . They raced the English in a great foot race for the land , and the English cheated . They had many men who ran far . The Shawanees moved into the sunset again . That was not so long ago , he said . The grandmother of Nym- wha had her lodge near the place where the lodges of the Broad Hats stand on the Delaware . Nymwha , himself , had played there when he was a young boy . Now he was hiding in a gorge on the Ohio . The Shawanees were still wanderers . In his lifetime they had fled westward across the mountains into the great forests . The English had followed and built cabins in the valleys of the hills in the Shawanee hunting grounds by the Juniata . It was there that HOW NYMWHA BLEW ON A CONCH SHELL 53Nymwha would have made his home . He liked that country best . His fathers slept by the streams there . But now the English were coming again . They were coming into the Ohio country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had done that before . Nymwha could remember all that . He would say no more . He smoked the pipe , and sat silent . Of the days to come he would say nothing at all . . . . In the month when the British were cutting a road through the forest over the mountains , and the French and Indians watched for them at Fort Duquesne , Kaysinata came to visit his half-brother Nymwha at the gorge near the high rocks . He came secretly by night in a canoe from the fort , and alone . The Big Turtle was a famous warrior now . The scalp locks of the English hung in fringes from his leggings , and the war paint gleamed on his face . " Dost thou still exist ? " said Nymwha , and held out his hand . " I do , " replied Kaysinata , " and here is my hand . " Kaysinata and Nymwha said nothing to the women for fear the bad ghosts of their mothers might follow them when they made medicine .

A deer was then killed . They had venison and roasted the first ears of the young corn for a feast . All by now were very hungry , but the feast was a sign that Nymwha and the Big Turtle had made good medicine . The two chiefs sat together in the same lodge and smoked fine tobacco . They invited the Little Turtle to come and sit with them . " Does he learn ? " asked Kaysinata . " He does , " replied Nymwha . " It is well , " said the Big Turtle . " Let Mawakis fetch him a coal for his pipe . Let him begin . " So the Little Turtle smoked with the two chiefs before all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nymwha had praised him greatly . As for Kaysinata , he returned to Fort Duquesne by night as secretly as he had come . And it was high time he came back there , for he found that nearly half the warriors were gone . As the Englishdrew nearer , and the strength of " Bladock 's " army became known , canoe after canoe had slipped down the Beautiful River , or up the Allegheny , filled with warriors , with the gifts which the French had given them , with the loot and prisoners from their54 THE FOREST AND THE FORTraids on English settlements . There were a number of white women and children among them who were thus spirited off into the wildernessand were seen no more . Soon the glow in the sky by night from the watch fires of the tribes was only a small patch on the clouds to what it had been before .

Althoughamongst them the authority of their chiefs was great , many had left while the Big Turtle was away . More were preparing to go . It took all of his persuasion and oratory , the promises and presents of Monsieur de Beaujeu to detain the remainder . For that purpose Kaysinata held an assembly of the Shawnee warriors . He taunted those who had left , with panic and cowardice . He lauded those who remained . He promised them that when the English approached nigh the fort a messenger should go to Nymwha , who would make medicine just when the battle was about to be joined . Nymwha would blow upon the ancient conch shell three times , said Kaysinata , and ask the help of their grandfathers ' ghosts . Kaysinata reminded them that when this had been done before the Shawnees had always prevailed . It was a certain medicineto be used only to drive the paleface from the land .

" Bladock " was a fool . The hatchet would surprise him and find him out . Thus , by arts and promises , the Big Turtle persuaded them to stay . There was a great war ( lance at the fort . Their father , the commandant , Monsieur de ( ' ontrcc  --  ur , sat in his chair and gave his children new guns , lead , blankets , and powder . An English boy named Smith , who had been captured near 1:aystown , was made to run the gantlet . Afterward the French nursed him back to life in the fort . All was ready . The place of the ambush was decided upon near the lower crossing of the Monongahela . The English were only three marches away . The sound of their cannon could be heard in the forest at sunrise . At the beginning of the moon of Full Leaves a messenger came down the river to Nymwha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time has come . Speak to the grandfathers . " Then Nymwha arose from the lodge where he had been singingHOW NYMWHA BLEW ON A CONCH SHELL 55and fasting . He put the women in one hut and tied the door fast with wolf gut . He threatened them , and told them not to watch or follow him . He took his box with the medicine in it , his best blankets , his feathers , a copper kettle , and his paint pots . He caught the two best horses out of seven that fed in the long glade at the top of the cliffs , and bidding the Little Turtle to follow at a respectfuldistance , he set off southward into the forest , singing a powerful song to his grandfathers . After a day the Little Turtle knew that song , for the words went the same way over and over again . He joined in , and Nymwha was pleased . The trail south was a good one . It was narrow and it led along the crests of the hills . It was the warpath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherokees . There were signs carved upon the rocks , if one knew where to look for them . There were old pictures painted on the blazes of ancient trees . They told of the passing of many warriors long ago before there were horses . On the third day Nymwha and the Little Turtle came to a tall hill in the midst of the largest stretch of meadows the Little Turtle had ever seen . Once there must have been cornfields there . He could see that . On the top of the hill was a fort of the Old People , with a mound in the middle . Inside the fort there grew a kind of fragrant pine tree which the Little Turtle had never seen before , and many of the bitter drink bushes . All these had come from the south , Nymwha said . They camped there and Nymwha watched exactly to see where the sun rose and set . He made a broad mark on the two pine trees to mark the sun 's place in the east and the west , and he laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day they made ready to make medicine . They cleansed themselves , and fasted . First they uncovered an old hearth of stone under the deep pine needles . Nymwha knew exactly where it was . They built a fire on it until the stones were hot . Then they put out the fire , swept the stones clean , and built a frame of saplings over them which they covered with blankets . After the stones cooled somewhat , Nymwha threw upon them dried bundles of herbs which he had brought with him , and the tender end-shoots of the pines gathered on the spot . They packed the floor thick with these , and every cranny of it . Next they went down to the river together and drew the brass kettle full of water , after washing it clean with sand . Then they took it back slung on a pole between them to the top of the hill . Nymwha now removed all the wire from the long gristle loops of his ears . He took off all his clothes , even his breechclout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the same . He plucked leaves from the bitter drink bushes and made a strong , brown brew that was rank . They drank this . After a while they became dizzy . They fell down , and vomited . Then Nymwha dumped the water from the kettle on the hot stones in the hut covered with blankets . He and the Little Turtle crawled in and sat in the aromatic steam . They sat there till the paint and the grease and the sweat ran out of them . Pretty soon balls of wax fell out of their ears . They sat there till Nymwha was through chanting the cleansing song . Then they darted out of the hut and plunged into the river . They drank deeply of the cool water . They felt well . They were clean inside and out . The Little Turtle saw when he came out on the bank that he was a white man . Only the mark of the red turtle remained very clear over his heart . It was bigger now . It had grown with him . Nymwha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went back to the hills , wrapped themselves in their blankets , and slept . In the nighttime the Little Turtle dreamed . He heard his mother scream . It seemed to come from underground . He remembered again what had happened to him and to her . He awoke shivering . He was very hungry . He had not eaten for two days . The owls sang . He was an Indian again . IIe said nothing to Nymwha of his dream for fear Nymwha would know the ghost of his mother had followed him . He went to sleep once more . Nymwha awoke him at sunrise . He would not let him eat . " This is the day , " Nymwha said . Then he began to make big medicine . He painted himself carefully , then he faced south from the deer thong that stretched between the two pine trees . He walked south for as many paces as he had fingers and toes . On the spot where he stopped he built a pile of big stones with a flat one on top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a deer , and lumps of the sweet gum which had gathered in the marks he had made on the two pine trees . Over these Nyniwha laid clean , dry twigs . He sang a loud song , kindled a fire with his fire sticks , and fanned it with a fan made out of eagles ' wings. " 0 , ho , " he said , " 0 , ho , ho . " The fire burned fiercely and consumed the deer heart and the gum . Nymwha then threw fine tobacco upon it . The good leaf burned slowly . A thick , sweet smoke arose . Nymwha fanned it into the south. " 0 , ho , " he said , " 0 , ho , ho-ho . " Grandfathers in the far island , grandfathers and warriors of the People of the South , listen . All is not well with your children , HOW NYMWHA BLEW ON A CONCH SHELL 57the Sawanos . The paleface comes again .

I , Nymwha , of the clan of the Turtle of your children , the Sawanos , I call upon you , I say the old words of the fisherman . I speak to you three times with the loud voice of the shell. " 0 , ho . 0 , ho , ho . " The fan made of the wings of eagles scorched slowly on the fire and poured forth a dense white smoke . Nymwha stood before it , tall and waiting . His blanket drooped from his shoulders to his feet . He raised his hands three times before the fire , saying the secret words . Suddenly the feathers sublimed in an intense , clear flame . They crackled . Nymwha drew the old conch shell from under his blanket and blew on it . All the woods echoed back as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shell a second time . While he filled his lungs for the final effort , the echo answered back . Nymwha smiled . He seemed to hear the war horns of his grandfathers . He raised the shell and blew on it a third time . Not a sound came forth . Only some white dust and a few grains of sea sand . Shattered by the vibration , the ancient shell fell to pieces in his hand . The Little Turtle saw that the big medicine of Nymwha had failed . But he was surprised not at that , but at how he felt about it . He was glad . He felt like a white man . He wanted to laugh . When the shell fell apart Nymwha had grunted . " Hoomph . " A ghost of smoke drifted down into the meadows from the dying fire . On the pile of stones the bones of the eagle wings coveredthe last embers like the fingers of a skeleton hand . Nymwha fell forward on his face , groaning . He was a man who had believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gorge was a quiet one . There were no songs along the way going back . " What you saw , you have not seen , " said Nymwha to the Little Turtle , and said no more . But the Little Turtle turned all these things over in his mind as he rode along . He was glad he had said nothing to Nymwha of his dream . It was no time to remind Nymwha that he was a white58 THE FOREST AND THE FORTman . But the Little Turtle had certainly been reminded of it . He was no longer so content that Kaysinata had stolen him . More than the big medicine had failed . He began to ponder on what his life as a white boy might have been . " Salathiel , Salathiel Albine , you come out of the woods . " How she had called him ! What had they done to his father ? Why was it he had never come back ? He thought of Kaysinata in a new way , and hated him . He was sorry for his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nymwha could care for nothing now that his medicine had failed . Already he rode his horse slumped down like an old man . What was going to happen ? Was it really better to live in the forest than to live like a white man ? Kaysinata said so . How did he know ? Someday I will talk to some of the captives , he promised himself . I will do so secretly . I will try to remember the words . I will tell them my name is Salathiel  --  Salathiel Albine . They will be glad to see me . I will ask them . So he pondered and tried to comfort himself as he rode back to the lodges by the Beautiful River . When they got there they were met by the tremendous news of Braddock 's defeat . Curiously enough , it was that news which confirmed the Little Turtle in beginning to ponder the ways of being an Indian . He was ashamed . And he was afraid now they would begin to remember he was a white man , after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although apparently he was reckless . He began to consider carefully the consequences of anything he did . This was partly due to the influence of Nymwha . Nymwha had made him learn many things by heart . Now he said them over and considered them . He found that he ' had always thought the English must win in the end . It might not be so now . It appeared that the Red Coats were no longer invincible . What then ? Now the youth called Little ' Turtle or Salathiel Albine  --  he did not yet know which  --  was not alone in his predicament . No battle fought iii North America has ever had such farreachingand permanent effects as Braddock 's defeat . Afterward , the battle was largely forgotten , but the effects went on . It was like the tolling of a great hell in time , whose ripple of sound grew less , but ever widened out in eternity . On the sunny afternoon ofJuly 9 , 1755 , in the ravines of a forest meadow along a river whose name most Englishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of the Horse Guards , lost quite definitelyand permanently the empire of Marlborough and Queen Anne , in the reign of his Majesty , George II . It was the first day on the white man 's calendar which Salathiel could be absolutely sure of . It was , of course , irrevocably fixed inHOW NYMWHA BLEW ON A CONCH SHELL 59his memory . Consciously or unconsciously , like most other Americansof his generation and time , he arranged the years of his life as before and after Braddock 's defeat , as time wore on . The French and the Indians at Fort Duquesne went crazy . They could hardly believe themselves . The British Red Coats had been beaten ! They had been massacred and stampeded . There was a way to stop them . The Indians and the Americans remembered the way . The French straightway forgot . Like brave Europeans they could not shake off an habitual preference for being massacred en masse . For them the battle was counted a victory , but it was also the beginning of the end of their empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky by night above the river gorge about Fort Duquesne after the battle , the constant firing of cannon , and the fusillades of joy that went on day after day ; the passing of canoes down the Ohio filled with prisoners with blackened faces , and their Indian captors howlinglike demons . It was a full week before the place quieted down . Those who had run away before the battle returned to take scalps and trophies from the stricken field . He and Nymwha beheld all this at a distance , from the high rocks above the river . Nymwha would not go to the fort . " Let them go by , " said Nymwha ; " this is the end . " It was not until many years later that Salathiel thought he knew what his uncle , the Shawnee , meant . Seven days after the victory Kaysinata came to see Nymwha . IIe was still quite drunk . He was still dirty and bloody ; covered with fringes of scalps that he had belted about him . He never knew himself how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he wanted . The dead lay heaped in the bushes , piled three deep . Kaysinata boasted himself to Nymwha . He vaunted his brave deeds , and the success of the great medicine . Then Nymwha laughed . He told Kaysinata what had happened . He showed him the fragments of the broken shell . It was only then that the Big Turtle finally grew silent . " Listen , " said Nymwha , " Kaysinata , my brother , you are a fool . The English and the Long Knives will come back again . The ( lays of our people are numbered . They will be broken even as the shell broke in my hand . The firewater will overpower you . You will lie with your face down in the mud like Mawakis . You will bite the dust . There is no longer a way to speak with our grandfathers . They have nothing to say to us . We are no longer their children . Go , and take the Little Turtle with you . He also is a paleface . Even your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will6o THE FOREST AND THE FORThave to give him back again . Treat him well , lest his people remember when they ask for him . Remember what I have said . I am Nymwha . I am not the spirit of firewater . I am sober . " Kaysinata listened , but he was furiously angry . He made the Little Turtle and Mawakis leave the lodges of Nymwha . He shouted insults at Nymwha , and boasted . But he was sad and terrified at heart . All that summer he raided the English frontiers to prove that Nymwha was wrong . He brought gifts and spoil  --  horses , clothes , and weapons  --  back to Logstown . Soon the villages along the Beaver were full of miserable women and children " captivated " from the settlements . There were only a few men . . . . Then the English began to come over the mountains again . Nymwha was right . After only three winters the English were back at the fort at the Great Forks . The General Forbes was a sick man , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That general died , but the English stayed . The General Stanwix came next and started building a fort at the Great Forks out of brick . They called it Fort Pitt now . The French had gone . They would never come back again . They had given the Indian lands to the English . What was a man with many English prisoners going to do ? The times were terrible . Kaysinata raided , and drank . He fell down in the mud and put his face in it with Mawakis . Sometimes there was nothing to eat . Finally he made peace with the English at Fort Pitt . Meanwhile , the Little Turtle had been forced to shift for himself as best he could . Many Indian lads had to do that in those days . The Little Turtle had become a lone wolf . IIe was what the older warriors called a " young scalp " . Ile had gone secretly to Nymwha , and taken his advice . It was good advice , well suited to the times . And what times they were could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They Found Moses in the BulrushesTHERE were four of them , all about the same age . There was the Little Turtle , Locust Mouth , Whippoorwill Hill , and Black Hawk . They were not quite young braves yet , but old enough to be free of the squaws . When the firewater and the English traders came now they had learned to flee the lodges on the Beaver and live to themselves . It was usually sometime between the first fall of leaves and the coming of ice on the waters when they stole a canoe and lived on the islands up and down the Beautiful River in the fat season of the year . As time went on , and their tactics improved , they returned only at longer and longer intervals to the village , and they gradually increased the scope of their depredations . It was a life of complete freedom and irresponsibility , maintainedby infinite cunning and stealth . No small animal and not many large ones were safe from them . The islands they haunted at first were long reaches of low forest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand beach . They stretched for miles along the river in places . They teemed with small life : squirrels , rabbits , coons , possums , waterfowl , and turkeys . The antlered deer swam the river between them , back and forth . Snapping turtles were their first and by no means most contemptibleenemy . Locust Mouth lost a big toe . Despite that , they learned to snare the ducks in the water . They caught enormous bcwhiskered catfish , and feasted . One island was a grove of nothing but chestnut trees . The squirrels tasted sweetest there . It became the favourite haunt of the band . A swift current with eddies protected that island 's shores . There were mussels and clams on the shoals. 6i62 THE FOREST AND THE FORTBut they moved often . It was partly instinctive precaution and partly restlessness . When they tired of one island they moved to another at night under the stars . The small , black canoe made no noise . They would land , hide out in the rushes to make sure no one was before them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural discipline kept them together , and the fear of discovery . The hand of all men , even the squaws ' , would be against them . As the strict tribal customs of the Indians began to break up and lapse in the years of war , raids , and no less devastating trade with the English , such free-lance and wandering bands of hungry and murderous youngsters were not unusual . Their success dependedentirely on what skill they could develop among themselves . They were the crows , or the hawks and eaglets , of the forest , upon whom no one had mercy  --  if they were caught . The band of the Little Turtle existed successfully at odd times , for several years by the simple strategy of never being seen or heard , and by not stealing from or closely approaching Indian villages . They throve on and in the forest alone . They hunted silently with snares , bow and arrow , tomahawk , and scalp knife . They had one small iron pot under which they lit carefully smokeless fires in hollowclay banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That arrangement kept the boy on watch cold , alert , and awake . There was little talking , and shouting was unthinkable . They called themselves the " Shadow Brethren " , and acted the parts . For the rest , there were four fine scalping knives , three good , keen English hatchets , and the canoe and paddles. ' i'hat was all , except for the Little Turtle 's flint and steel and his powerful bow of arc wood . He made his own arrows  --  and he followed Nymwha 's advice , whom he visited secretly at the gorge from time to time . The Little Turtle was now much taller than his bow . He was " high as the head of a horse " , and he shot long , straight , and hard . He was not cruel ; he simply had no qualms at all . He was like a young male panther in its third year , long muscular , and lean . The Shadows wore brcechclouts , moccasins , and their hair in knots like little grain sheaves on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they kept shaved . The Little Turtle had a brown scalp lock .

Fluff , appeared on him , which he carefully singed off . It was an embarrassing disHOWTHEY FOUND MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES 63tinction not to be tolerated . His skin thus became hardened by fire . Ile promised to be a young giant shortly . His muscles were like fluid oak wood , and the others were rightly afraid of him if it came to a quarrel . He simply lifted them clear of his shoulders and hurled them down with a crash . He used their own strength against them , as Kaysinata had taught him , and among the Shawneeswrestling was an ancient art . His senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind gave him a wider and more certain play of thought . He saw that when one thing happened another must follow . The others did not , unless they had seen things happen together that way before . Then they expected the same thing over and over again . He did not . That was the chief difference between him and the other Shadows , and perhaps , too , he could decide and carry things out more quickly and to a certain result , because he could remember back time and imagine the future more vividly than his brothers . " Now " was enormously complete to them ; night was more like the passing of a cloud than the passing of time . The forest was eternity  --  but not for the Little Turtle . He dreamed of somethingand somewhere else . He wondered . Gradually the four of them came to have but one will and purpose . It was by mutual , almost by unconscious consent that both were supplied by the Little Turtle . Black Hawk , the son of a chief , was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . The absence of firearms among them they finally came to realize as their chief advantage . Other people betrayed themselves sooner or later by the smoke of careless fires or the firing of guns . They performed silently , and were never out of powder or stopped by the damp . They learned to take the deer in the water . An exhausted doe about to make a landing found four topknots swimming beside her at twilight , and her throat cut . An unerring stone , a loop in the grass , or a twig trap was the death of any small thing they fixed upon as prey . For birds  --  an arrow came flitting from the thicket and struck the drumming partridge from the log . They marked down what they needed and took it . There was always something for the pot . On the Isle of Chestnuts in the autumn they were even like to become fat . They kept coming back there often after the first year , in spite of a difficult landing . The river was narrow on either side , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most people went around , and the place was their own for quiet keeping . That was why and where they caught the Reverend James McArdle . From a certain point of view the arrival of Mr. McArdle on64 THE FOREST AND THE FORTthe Isle of Chestnuts might be regarded as a sheer physical accident . That was the light in which the Shadows looked at it . He came like a fish from the stream . But even accidents are said not to occur in a timeless vacuum . And from the standpoint of Mr. McArdlehimself , his sudden advent on an island in the Ohio was a beautifully special act of God . He was left there , like Moses , in the bulrushes . James McArdle was a self-constituted missionary , Scotch-Irish from Belfast , fanatically learned , and as hard to root out of the land as a dock weed . He insisted that God had called him loudly to preach to the Indians . Some averred he might have heard another noise . But preach he did . He had played apostle to five eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon to the Munsees on the circumcision must have been misinterpreted by them , for they had removed both his ears instead . He had borne this with patience , however , since his vital organ , the tongue , still remained intact . And with it he had continued to preach his novel doctrine , whenever and wherever he could , to the effect that the Indians were the lost ten tribes of Israel , a remnant of God 's chosen people condemned to wander in the wilderness again until the news of their redemption was brought to them . Mr. McArdle was by no means alone in this opinion . Many of his more discreet , reverend , and regularly licensed brethren concurred  --  butfor the most part in writing . It was only natural , then , that his rather unwelcome news of the alleged partiality of the Deity for Indians , or lost Hebrews , should not be received by the harried and burnt-out laity of the English settlements with a helpfulburst of sustaining glee . Quite the contrary . Suffice it to say that even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably enjoying constant hot water , and many close shaves , on the indignant Pennsylvania frontiers . Martyr and rebel to the core , no human pressure could straighten out his spiritual eccentricity . Finally , he was carried bodilyout of the Conococheague settlement on a fence rail . And he was then forced to look on while some miserable squaws , three little children , and two old men of the Delawares , whom he had harboured and comforted , were quietly knocked on the head in the year of grace 1759 . Earless and disillusioned , sick at heart but indomitable , he set out westward over the new " Glades Road " , lately cut by General Forbes , and for some months cobbled for the garrison and teamsters at the new Fort Ligonier on the Loyalhanna . Opportunity serving , he then joined an ammunition convoy , and the late autumn of theHOW THEY FOUND MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES 65same year found him mending shoes on weekdays and souls on the Sabbath at Fort Pitt . Already there was a considerable settlement at Pittsburgh . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the garrison , and a constant stream of Indians who came and went . So the field of redemption there appeared both ample and ripe . But in his hope for a harvest Mr. McArdle was once more given to suffer frustration . The king 's deputy Indian agent , George Croghan , was an Irish Catholic . It was rumoured that on the previous St. Patrick 's Day he had openly drunk the health of the Pretender , in the fervour of his cups . However that might be , when sober he looked with a jaundiced eye upon the efforts of Orangemen to evangelize the " king 's Indians " . Once again Mr. McArdle was prevented . Nor did he fare much better in his efforts among the Welsh , Swiss , and Pennsylvania Germans of the Royal Americans in garrison . Their commander at the time was also a Swiss , an impoverished officer , but a cultivated gentleman , who had been nourished at the very breast of Calvinism in his native Geneva , as a child . Yet  --  as he himself put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He went in for mathematics , and he read Voltaire . Then , too , as a soldier he was inclined to render most things to C2esar , and he would tolerate no spiritual advisers in the confines of the posts committed to his charge , except those " duly appointed by mundane authority to ration their celestial nonsense to the king 's troops " . Thus at the very outset Mr. McArdle 's dream of a Theban Legion at Fort Pitt , as well as his hopes of a harvest of souls amongst the lost tribes of Israel , were murdered , as it were , in the cradle like holy twin innocents . And when the Reverend James went in unto Herod to protest  --  eloquently -- he found instead a clapper and dangerous little soldier , who occasionally smelled at a verbena-scented handkerchief , while he rocked the foundations of Mr. McArdle 's faith seriously . In short , McArdle was given his clay in court , treated as an equal , as a scholar and a gentleman ; and lost his case on the flaws in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soul-shattering experience for the Reverend James , who was finally dismissed with a glass of neat brandy and the military courtesies of the gate . And so to pastures new . That was the only alternative to cobbling . The unknown and unconverted wilderness lay westward before him , where the lost tribes wandered ad lib . This was , he felt , the crucial test of his faith . He obtained a " small shallope " , as doubtful as the charity which conferred it , and , despite the fact that winter would soon66 THE FOREST AND THE FORTbe coming on , he set off down the Ohio , remarking that the Lord would provide . The Beautiful River did all the rest . It was three days later when necessity and the current drove him ashore at the Isle of Chestnuts . It was twilight , and he was weak and cold from exposure and little food . He caught his foot in a crevice of rock as he stepped ashore , and snapped his ankle painfully . He lay for a moment groaning among the rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wolves . His dugout slowly floated off in an eddy . Possibly because he lay perfectly still , they did not kill him immediately . They scarcely knew what to do with a perfectly inert " enemy " . This was submission itself . So they stood around looking at him curiously in the last grey twilight . He had fainted , more from the pain in his ankle than from the beating they had given him . Then he came to again and said something in the Onondaga tongue . There was no reply . He tried several other dialects , with no result . Then he began to pray , for his pain was great and he thought his time had come . He said , " Our Father " . " My mom say that , " said a young voice out of the darkness , with a strange thick accent . " Who are you , then ? " demanded McArdle hopefully . There was a pause . " Sal  --  Salathi-el Albine , " the voice replied presently . The Little Turtle could remember his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame the syllables satisfactorily when he tried to speak them . For him it was a momentous reply , as well as for Mr. McArdle . The sudden question out of the darkness , " Who are you ? " had forced an issue , which , deep in his being , the boy had been asking himself over and over , and getting no answer . Now an instant reply had been demanded from the outside . There was no time to adjust the balance nicely and reconsider . The weight of the stranger 's question had unexpectedly been thrown into the scale . The Little Turtle was forced to speak up , and he found it was Salathiel Albine who stood there , after all . He had simply been disguised as the Little Turtle . It was Salathiel who found himself . Now he knew . As for the Reverend James , he felt that he was saved alive . His prayer had been answered . Hope was like a drink of strong cordial to him . He revived . Ile sat up , and managed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He even made it understood that his dugout was floating away . Salathiel gave the word and two of the boys plunged in and eventually returned with it . It was a long , cold swim in the darkHOWTHEY FOUND MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES 67ness , and they almost missed it . McArdle had the presence of mind to reward them with a knife and spoon . Things went better after that . Meanwhile , he had been able to tell something of his predicamentto young Albine . He and the boy called Locust Mouth finally picked up the ReverendJames between them and carried him to a hollow behind the bank , where they built up a fire and laid him beside it . Albine wrapped him in his blanket and they gave him some roast squirrel and hot , baked chestnuts . He sent them back to his boat for a little corn meal and salt , and they baked cakes on a stone . McArdle 's foot was numb now . He strained every nerve to make himself welcome . Some iron fishhooks from a small box in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found that by talking slowly , and by using simple words and gestures , he could make himself understood in English by the big boy with the turtle on his breast . Thus the evening wore away with McArdle as an object of considerable interest . Curiosity and novelty had apparently been substitutedfor hostility . Nothing , however , finally allayed the pain of a broken ankle , and in spite of the risks the minister was at last forced to do something about it . He was a man of iron nerves , and after explaining as well as he could to Albine , he gave directions for setting his leg . They hauled and pulled him until he fainted again . Once the " fun " becamefast and furious , and if he had groaned or cried out the young savages might have found it too interesting to leave off . But he kept silent , and he finally got them to bind his leg in a piece of heavy bark for a splint  --  and stop . It was an ill job , of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of his life . His foot turned in . They remained at the island for nearly a fortnight . A period of lazy Indian summer had set in . McArdle was unable to walk and the Shadows were content enough to linger . A division of spoil had taken place . The " shallope " and all the rest of the captive 's small effects were divided amongst Locust Mouth , Black Hawk , and Whippoorwill Hill . McArdle himself fell to the Little Turtle as the share of the leader . He managed to preserve his Bible and watch by giving them to Salathiel , who kept them as the white man 's big medicine . In that he was sincere enough , for he soon came to regard McArdle as a Nymwha among the palefaces . McArdleknew many signs of the Old Medicine . He belonged . Through the long hours of the night the Reverend James talked to the white boy . He talked of the white lodges in the Sunrise Land beyond the mountains , where the people were more numerous than68 THE FOREST AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened while Salathiel within him awakened and dreamed . The glimmering vocabulary of his childhood began to come back . They said their prayers together while the others slept . The Reverend James began secretly to teach Salathiel many things . He began with the watch , which was magic and a speaking thing . For the first time , and suddenly , Salathiel became aware of the audible and visual passage of time . Where was he going , and what would he be ? All this was kept private from the three other Shadows , who would never know . Gradually the boy felt the pride of his race stir within him . It was his people who had made the watch . All that McArdle spoke of belonged to him if he should claim it . Greater than being the son of the Big Turtle was being one of the white men . All these things he kept in his breast and said nothing . One morning the season changed suddenly and there was a skin of ice on the shallows about the island . It was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident in the white man 's " big canoe " . They laid him in it and paddled back two days to the mouth of the Beaver . That year the Shawnees had gone farther up the creek . Near the old huts at Logstown they killed two wolves and took their skins . Every winter there were more wolves now . Wolves followed war . The Big Turtle was proud of his son for the prisoner he had taken . He let McArdle lie by the fire in the lodge . Mawakis was pleased and happy that the Little Turtle had come back . Things would go better for her with him around . McArdle made himself useful . Ile made things with his hands and spoke of the Great Spirit . They soon respected and feared him . Sal Albine began to regain the use of his English tongue . Once resumed , it came back , and it went on with a rush . Hitherto , the Little Turtle had felt it beneath him to converse with white captives . But this man was different , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his talk on some of the other captives . There were many that year . There was a certain white girl he had noticed . He spoke to her . He liked her , but she was afraid of him . She still thought he was an Indian . It was best not to tell her that he was n't . Kaysinata might be angered . He was jealous for his son . Meanwhile , the Reverend James McArdle 's leg was slowly healingand he talked at night of many things . Mawakis would go to sleep , wake up again suddenly , and grunt . Then they would laugh , conscious that the difference between her sleeping and waking existencewas merely an unpleasant surprise . The fire flickered and smoked as before . But there were new pictures in the embers for Salathiel . Shadows of Indian SummerTHE YEARS were at hand when for all the English frontiers , hut especially in Pennsylvania , the terrible expression " Indian sumnier " took on an even more deeply sinister meaning than it had had before . It was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made the season so memorable ; not the quiet , noble triumph of the year . It was the renewedand extended terror of the delay of winter that made the paleface paler . The Indians were summer fighters . Winter brought surcease to the settlers . Indian summer meant more Indians longer in the fall . After the French were driven north , and westward down the Beautiful River , there was a brief pause in hostilities . A peace was patched up between the English and the tribes along the Ohio . The hot embers of French resistance smouldered , flared up , and finally died away at Montreal . All men waited to see what the Englishwould do . Would they return again to the Dawn Lands , or would they stay west of the mountains ? Even the faithful Iroquois were restive and watchful . The Shawnees and Delawares mourned secretly for their fathers , the French . Who now would help them against the English and the Long House ? But for a time they waited . They let the English traders come among them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their captives they kept . When General Stanwix left Fort Pitt in the early spring of 176o , thirty-five chiefs accompanied him eastward . Kaysinata and Nymwha went along . Some turned back at Raystown , but the halfbrotherswent clear to Philadelphia , leaving their horses at Lancaster . In Philadelphia they saw the great town and the endless num-6970 THE FOREST AND THE FORThers of the Broad Hats and English . They saw the canoes with cannon that sailed upon the rivers and over the great salt lake . They saw them come from and depart into the sunrise . They saw the streets swarming with people , horses , and wagons . The drums banged , the soldiers marched . The Broad Hats spoke of peace . The church bells kept ringing . They sat in the house of the governor and dined like Manitous . The Governor Hamilton shook hands with them . He called them " my children " , and they felt small . The general hung a gold medal around their necks with the English king 's face on it . The speaker of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house gave them a few stingy presents . Then they were dressed up like British majors all but the wig , packed in wagons , and sent off . They were kicked out at Lancasterto get home as best they might . A Broad Hat there had sold their horses to pay for the corn . People laughed at them , or looked at them with sullen hate . Nymwha and Kaysinata had seen . They understood . When they were very small they had hunted in the forests and fished along the streams where the farms and villages now stood . They saw that the English increased mightily ; that nothing could withstand them . They traded their gold medals for horses at Harris 's and fled home over the mountains . At Fort Bedford a white man named Garrett Pendergass fed them , warmed them by a huge chimney in his store , and gave them new trading blankets after they had made the sign of amity . He understood the Old Medicine . He belonged . He treated them as chieftains of a great nation . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way west . At the foot of the Allegheny ridge , by the ruins of the old Shawnee cabins , Nymwha and Kaysinata burned tobacco at the graves of their fathers . Already large trees grew on the low mounds of the sleepers . They kindled a fire on the old hearth found under the soil and ashes . They saw the stars rise over the mountains in the same places as they had in ancient clays . The black mountains twisted like great serpents across the starpath . The dark forests murmured with old voices . They prayed to the dead . They slept by their last fire in the beautiful valley of the land of their boyhood . They sang the song of the hunter who returns no more . It was early summer when they got back to the Ohio . They avoided the English at Fort Pitt . The place was made strong with brick and stone now . It bristled with cannon that looked into the three rivers and the moat . The English were not going . They had built a strong house to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nymwha and Kaysinata had seen what they had seen . SHADOWS OF INDIAN SUMMER 71They agreed to act secretly together , come what might . Nymwhawent back to his lodges in the gorge near the fort . Kaysinata returned to the Beaver . Kaysinata moved his lodges that summer clear out to the Wabash . He went hunting farther westward than ever before . The belts of Pontiac and his brother , the Prophet , were going around . Many had laid hold of them and promised not to let go . Kaysinata had not yet held one in his hand . He was hunting . He moved often . He took the Little Turtle , McArdle , Mawakis , and three of the " captivated " English women along . Black Hawk and Locust Mouth followed . They were made welcome by the fire . They camped for a while at the salt lick where the buffalo came trampling a great road , and the huge teeth of the mysterious dead beasts were found . There were countless bones of these great animals only a little way under the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and monsters before the Flood . They ran short of powder here , but there were no traders to go to . " Arrows will do , as they did for our fathers , " said the Big Turtle . The young men shook their heads . Kaysinata permitted the young men much freedom now . In anothersummer they would be made braves of the tribe . He also listened to McArdle when he spoke of the Great Spirit . But he smoked his pipe and said nothing . He had heard from the French about Maly 's Son . This was another medicine . But the words were good . McArdle was a wise man . He kept peace in the camp . He made it possible for the three captive white women to exist . Kaysinatawould permit no one else to speak to them . Kaysinata respectedMcArdle . He let him come and go as he liked . He was good , and he was harmless . He knew the old signs . That summer the Little Turtle , the Reverend James , Black Hawk , and Locust Mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the prairies that belonged to the Illinois . They rode at last to the place where the trees came to an end . An ocean of grass stretched away into the sunset . Locust Mouth was frightened , heaven was so vast . But McArdle wrote a book about this country on strips of bark . He bound it together with deer sinews , and two slabs for covers . He had taught the Albine boy how to read out of his pocket Bible . He and the two Indian boys and young Albine hunted buffalo together on the prairies . The Illinois were friendly with them . They were very cleanly , and lived in beautiful villages . Even their dogs were brought to be village broken . It was a good summer . Salathiel learned to make the marks that spoke on the bark . McArdle practisedhim constantly . He made him write most of the book about72 THE FOREST AND THE FORTthe Fox Indians and the prairie . They made pens out of the feathers of wild geese . Salathiel wrote down what McArdle would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used many strips of long bark . Out of his Bible McArdle began to demonstrate the meaning of words . He taught God and language at the same time . He explainedand explained . He acted and gestured . He even drew rough pictures . In two years he taught Salathiel how to count and cipher . He began with sticks of wood , stones , fingers and toes , and ended with geometrical figures . Secretly the missionary had great hopes for the boy over whose mind and soul he laboured . He felt that he owed him his life . Salathiel Albine could now speak his native tongue much better than he knew . The Reverend James McArdle was a bigoted enthusiast , but a learned man . He had come to preach to the Indians , but the Lord had shown him another work . More and more his time was taken up with the white captiveshe came across . There were many of them , even among the Illinois . And there were many more farther east among the Shawneesand Delawares . In the winters McArdle went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administering to the captives and preaching to them or the Indians whenever he could . He and the Little Turtle wrote the names of these captives and where they came from upon bark tablets and concealed them . Most of the Indians were in awe of McArdle . They saw that the finger of the Great Spirit had touched his head . There could be no doubt of it . He even gave things away because people needed them . He did kind deeds without asking anything in return . Also he set bones and attempted to treat disease . In this he was not always successful , but many in their own time and way were grateful . Thus the Reverend James could pass from tribe to tribe , and was welcome .. 11is knowledge of Indian tongues was now astonishing . And many a hopeless white prisoner had cause to bless him . The smallpox came walking through the forest in ' 61 , and in many a village where there had heed songs there was silence . McArdle bound the scabs of the spotted sickness on the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he soon recovered . It was a light case , and he was never troubled again by the spotted sickness . This " cure " tended to cement the bond between Salathiel and McArdle , when they returned to the Beaver again in the early autumn after the great hunting westward . That was the last fall that the Shadows hunted together as a free band of young scalps . That year they ranged the forest northSHADOWSOF INDIAN SUMMER 73ward to the great lake called Erie . Raids on the settlements had once again surreptitiously begun . There were many small war partiespassing to and fro from the mountains . The Shadows were strong young hunters now , but that autumn it was dangerous work . They stole what they needed from war parties and others , and fled . They became enormously skilful and cunning . They stole horses and loot from famous warriors returning from the settlements . They grew proud of themselves , and they grew bolder . Near Venango , on the Allegheny , they caught some Indian girls in a river cornfield and lay with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Little Turtle had no such luck . He was dead-white under his breechclout , and his girl was afraid of him . She cried out bitterly , and the old men came swarmingout of the villages with muskets . The boys had to swim down the river to their horses and ride away with the bullets whistling around them . It was a close thing . After it was over the others , particularly the young Black Hawk , boasted . They were men now . They had proved it . Sal Albine said nothing . He knew he was white , and different from his comrades . He was finally convinced of that . The Indian girl had been afraid of him . He was a stranger . She had screamed . Kaysinata was very angry when they returned . Ganstax , a Senecachief , one of the Mingoes , had complained to him . The Shadows had been recognized at Venango . It was time such foolishness was over , said the Big Turtle . Next year they must be received as full warriors , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these days Kaysinata and Nymwha were both much troubled . Secretly , they wished to remain friends with the English . But Kaysinatahad been forced to lay hold of the war belt sent by Pontiac . IIe had sent blue wampum in return . Nymwha was not a great warrior . His actions were not so jealously watched . He promised to make medicine and spy on the English . He was plausible . He left the gorge and moved upriver nearer to the fort on a stream called Sawmill Run . The English had built a lumber mill there and posted soldiers near the mouth of the creek . The place was almost opposite the fort . Nymwha felt safer there . He warned his friend McKee of the trouble to come . The commandant began quietly to prepare . . . . In the spring all the tribes were to rise as one man and at one time . They were to surprise all the English forts west of the mountains and massacre the garrisons to a man . They were to fall on the settlements at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no harvest but death on the frontier . All the74 THE FOREST AND THE FORTcabins and little villages west of the mountains were to be burned . There was to be no mercy . The hatchet was to speak to the English from the Great Lakes to the Potomac . The silence of the forest was to resume . Even the Six Nations wavered in their loyalty to the English king . Many of the Senecas and all of the Mingoes joined Pontiac . There were many secret councils . All were to act together . There was to be only one enemy , the paleface . The Shawneesand their grandfathers , the Delawares , secretly rejoiced . Wait , wait until the spring ! Unfortunately , some could not wait . The excitement was too great . Raids began , led by individuals , even in the autumn before . Many prisoners , women and children , were brought back for hostages . There were more mouths than ever at a time when there was little food . Sickness came with the white captives . The winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever seen or heard so many wolves before . They sang at night . " It is the death howl of the land , " whispered the squaws . The plans of men , they knew , did not always succeed . White children with the Little Spots had been brought to the villages on the Beaver . That new trouble ran through the lodges of the Shawnees , the Mingoes , and the Delawares for miles back into the country like fire through a dry pine forest . Few entirely escaped . Many strong , old warriors died . Locust Mouth and Whippoorwill Hill were stricken . They built a sweat lodge , and threw water on the hot stones , and sat in the steam . They died the next day , speechless and swollen . The Little Turtle and McArdle buried them . Measles was the English name of that death . The Little Turtle buried many friends . IIe was not sick with those spots either . All who crawled into the sweat lodge died , but that made no difference to the others . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also was speechless . She gave the Little Turtle the two gold coins on a bar that hung about her neck , medals that had come from her grandmothers . She patted his hand , and her eyes turned back in her head . The Little Turtle wept . McArdle said it was right he should do so . Black Hawk came and mourned with him . He was the only other Shadow left . Salathiel grew impatient . he heard of the plans for attacking the English . Many rumours flew about . Salathiel Albine began to think it was time to run away . " Wait , " said McArdle , " the time to do that will disclose itself . " Kaysinata sat in his empty lodge and drank firewater . He mourned for Mawakis and for old companions . Now that his squaw was gone , he missed her . He was troubled about the coming war . SHADOWS OF INDIAN SUMMER 75Nymwha had sent him secret messages . He would not himself come to the Beaver . Kaysinata was alone in the lodge now with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often went out . He sat with his head leaning against a keg of firewater . He drank from it with a wooden spoon . The snakes came for Kaysinata , and McArdle and the Little Turtle held him down . They put a stick in his mouth and tied it there . In a few hours , they were able to take it out and he talked to them again of things everybody could see . The traders had been murdered or warned away . Cloth and food and blankets were very scarce . Clothes wore out . That winter many dressed in wolfskins , and all but starved . Many captives died . Spring , it seemed , would never come . At the fort the English feasted and celebrated Christmas , 1762 . The commandant kept his powder dry and handy . Witchcraft and Deep SnowMARY CALAHAN was a white witch . She was a poor Celtic bogtrottersold out of Ireland into the plantations by some London snatchers , and later " captivated " by the Indians along with her American mistress and her daughter near Frederick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her mistress and her daughter , who had gone along to do the squaw work for Kaysinata on the western hunting of the summer before . " Malycal " , as the Indians called her , could neither read , write , nor speak much English . She spoke Erse as though it were a living liturgy , and her life mostly had been bright , age-old misery . But for all that she was a wisewoman from the hills of Munster with half an eye at times into the past or the future . It was a trick she had of cocking her eye into the mist . She foresaw the death of her mistress in detail , and foretold it with tears . But to no avail . For Mistress Jessica Lloyd was a proud , tireless woman , who despised the Irish even more than the Indians . Mary was left behind for her trouble when Mistress Lloyd and Miss Eva tried to escape in a bark canoe to Fort Pitt . They were drowned on the falls in the Beaver , and wolves tore their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a trader , came from Maryland and offered to ransom the Lloyds from the Shawnees . Wilson then wanted to take Mary back to Maryland , and offered Kaysinata four hundred blue wampum shells and his tow bag for her , but Mary did not want to go . She had five years to serve yet at Lloyds . She said the work was easier with the Indians , and that she hated the bloody English , who were cruel and cold as the Western Sea . Kaysinata let her have her way and refused to part with her . So76WITCHCRAFT AND DEEP SNOW 77she stayed on to make hominy for his lodge and foretell the weather and the hunting and certain select deaths . That had been in the early fall and Wilson was still able to get back to the fort . He was the last trader to visit the villages on the Beaver till the war was over , and his scalp prickled , for he felt the hatchet raised in the air over his head . When Mawakis died at the beginning of winter , Malycal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for him , taking better care of the lodge than any squaw , though she would sleep in no man 's blanket . Her fleas did their own hopping . She preferred to scratch alone , she said . No one troubled her . All the other women in the village were afraid of Malycal , both white and Indian . She knew when they were going to die . Sometimesshe laughed to herself , and sometimes she told them . She came and went pretty much as she pleased . People gave her tobacco when she needed it , so she would not think ill of them . When she drank she sang long songs in Irish . She sang the " Cattle Drive " . She was afraid of McArdle because he spoke Latin like a mass priest . He forbade her to mutter at him . On the whole , and considering , they got along together in the lodge not badly . And it was well they did , for it came on to be one of the worst winters ever known . Malycal foretold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her business to inform Kaysinata of the weather and he valued her much for it , because it helped the hunters . She would go out into a clearing , lie down , and look up at the sky for a long time . Presently she would stop winking and her face went dead . In the evening she would come back into the lodge , eat , and speak of the weather . Salathiel learned to believe her . He wrote down what she had said would happen on certain days , and it came out her way . Even McArdle was half convinced . Before the great snow came they roofed in the lodge of Kaysinata with pine slabs , and Malycal stuffed moss and clay between the logs of the walls like sod in a Munster shebang . She also brought in some coal which she had dug out of the streambank , like peat . It made the first coal fire Salathiel ever saw . It was so hot McArdle had to build a clay and stick chimney to contain it . Many now came to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farewell as soon as they poked their heads into the chief 's house . Some thought , afterward , she put the kibosh * on those she said good-bye to then . At last Kaysinata began throwing the hatchet at visitors and they stayed away both day and night. * That is , the cap of Death . THE FOREST AND THE FORTThen the snow came . Great black clouds of ducks and other wildfowl from the lake regions , flying south , began to darken the sun the day before . Next the sky came down close to the forest and turned pearl grey . The third day it grew dark as evening . Then it began to snow . It snowed for nineteen days . Sometimes it stopped at night when the wind died down , and the wolves could be heard howling . They gathered on the tops of the hills to sing . Otherwise the wind came steadily from the north . The forest began to lean towards the south . High trees finally collapsed quietly . At last no one could go out , the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate what they had , and waited . The Shawnees did not make snowshoes then like the Ottawas . They were the people of the south and it was not done . Everybody along the Beaver was soon pretty hungry . There was also an earthquake that winter before the snow went . It broke the ice on the river in places . The ground rumbled . Frozen catfish were thrown up out of the mud . It was a great help to those on the Beaver Creek , for no one could hunt in the soft drifts , and the fish saved many from starving . They came alive on the fire . Large , white horned owls came from the far north and sang to the villages till men 's blood froze . Some people went to the fort to beg from George Croghan . They got salt beef there , but no powder . The commandant , Captain Ecuyer , said he would give them plenty of powder and shot when they came in the spring . He laughed when he said it . When a hard crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and McArdle who did most of the hunting . What little fresh meat there was that winter they brought in . They took sleeping bears out of hollow trees . The deer had gone over the river . Even rabbits were scarce , for the owls and wolves lived on them . They shot grey wolves for their coats , and trapped otters . One day about midwinterthey killed a young elk . It was great luck . But they had ranged far to find him , and it took them two days to get the carcasshome over the snow . They hung it on trees at night and stood the wolves off with a leaping fire . At that they were nearly frozen , but the meat was desperately needed . In fact , it came in too late . When they got back to the village they heard Malycal keening , givingthe Irish death howl . Most of the white captives had been done away with in a massacre . There was nothing for them to eat and they would have died anyway , said Kaysinata . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful and strong had been saved . Now there wouldbe enough meat to go around . Those who had been done away with were stuffed into the river through a hole in the ice . If anyone came looking for them they would not be found . Kaysinata was anxious the news should not be taken to the fort . McArdle listened sadly to the chief and then went outside of the lodge to weep . He crossed off eleven names on his bark tablets and put a little hatchet after them . Salathiel saw there was now quite a bundle of these bark tablets with prisoners ' names , wrapped in deerskin . It was the record of most of the Indian captives held west of Fort Pitt . McArdle had been at great pains to get the names set down . Salathiel had helped write down many of them himself . He could remember the lists , too . McArdle and he had memorized them together . So many prisoners among the Delawares , so many among the Mingoes , the Shawnees , and the Illinois  --  so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names . He was to say nothing of the lists on the bark tablets . They were to go sometime to the fort . McArdle was afraid he would be killed and the names lost . If so , young Albine and the song would remember them . It would be time to take the list to the fort in the spring , McArdle said . Salathiel had made up his mind to go to the fort in the spring , anyhow . He would tell them that he was English and sing the song of the lists to the captain-commandant . Mawakis was gone now . He was tired of the gloomy life in the lodge . Kaysinata was getting old and demanding . Salathiel would not stay to go on the warpath against his own people . He would leave and go clear back to the inhabitants . Maybe he could find him a girl there . He was beginning to be much troubled under his breechclout . Black Hawk laughed at him . He took the young squaws into the woods and tried them out . He boasted often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white girl . " What is the difference ? " he asked . " To me , but not to you , " said Salathiel . " You are an Indian . " Black Hawk was surprised . When the snow finally went there was a great flood . Half the low country along the Beaver was like a lake . But it was better for the Indians that way . The game was driven to take refuge on high ground and hilltops that were now temporary islands . There was a great slaughter and everyone had plenty and to spare . Kaysinata now sent for rum to Venango . He paid a great price for it . No regular traders came that year on account of the troubles . There was a scarcity of cloth , powder , and blankets . Many dressed in skins again like their fathers . Few had expected this . The young warriors were now anxious to begin the attack on the English forts in order to plunder the stores . It was hard to restrain them . Kay-8o THE FOREST AND THE FORT WITCHCRAFT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Beaver . He wished to delay the attack until the time appointed . Two bears were killed , and he gave a feast . He also gave out the firewater . As a consequencenothing was decided . This suited Kaysinata well , for he was a much-perplexed man . McArdle saw to it that the whites who were still left alive had pickings from the feast . There were still seven of them in the vicinity , four children and three women . They had been afraid to call attention to themselves by asking for food . It was the sight of these captives which finally enabled the Big Turtle to make up his mind what course to take . He had tried to walk two paths at once , and so he staggered with uncertainty . He wished cautiously to remain friends with his powerful fathers , the English ; he longed to rise against them with his brother Pontiac and drive them from the land . Nymwha was partly responsible for this . He pointed out that , since the French and Indians together had failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians would now succeed alone . Nor would the Six Nations be with Pontiac . About the time the sugar sap began to run , a messenger came from the Long House to Kaysinatasaying , " Beware how you play the fool . " So the Big Turtle was left on tenterhooks . He saw his son , the Little Turtle , was about to leave him . In his heart Kaysinata was sad . He smoked much . He asked his pipe many questions . But there was no rum left to give him courage to answer them . Finally , he decided he would use the remaining captives to stay friends with the English by sending them safe and sound back to Fort Pitt . The commandant there , the Captain Ecuyer , was always demanding return of white captives . Now the Big Turtle would return them and so gain favour . And he would send the Little Turtle and McArdle along with the captives to guard them , and to take wampum to the commandant . The Little Turtle could make the speeches to the Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McArdle could explain away the massacre of the other prisoners , if they asked him . Ile could say they had been drowned in the flood . He was a man of God , whom the English would believe . Also he was an important prisoner himself . All this , of course , was to be done quite secretly . If Pontiac or his own people objected , he would explain it as a crafty move to lull the commandant into security before the attack . The more the Big Turtle smoked over the problem the better he liked what his pipe told him . One thing he liked especially . No one could say now that his son , the Little Turtle , had run away to his own people . Ifhe stayed on at the fort , Kaysinata could blame the English . He , himself , would not lose honour . Kaysinata hoped that the Little Turtle would stay at the fort ; that he would return to his own people , and never come back . It was not that in his own way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a good son , he admired him for his courage , wits , and strength . But the ritual reason why Kaysinata had shot the big , yellow-bearded smith in the back , stolen his boy baby and adopted him , had lapsed ; it no longer held good . Nymwha 's big medicine had failed . The clan of the Turtle could no longer speak with the grandfathers of the Sawanos . The old shell was broken . The words of the fisherman could be forgotten . The way was closed . The Clan of the Turtle could cease . It was for this , and not for sorrow of personal parting , that Malycal one night saw the tears run down the cheeks of Kaysinata , as the chief sat in his own corner and smoked bitter stems . Now that Mawakis was gone , Kaysinata talked with Malycal alone , or he talked to his grandfathers . It was hard to tell which . He muttered . But Malycal understood . Her people also had been driven west by the English long , long ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to her when she spoke in the gloom of the lodge where the coal fire flickered . The medicine of his own people had failed him . Nymwha agreed that the plan for the captives was a good one . Still it was hard for Kaysinata to come to the point . He began to feel like an old man . At last he called the Little Turtle and McArdle to him and explained his scheme . He let them see many things for themselves . 1 fc put matters so as to save his own face . As for Salathiel and McArdle , if they saw their own opportunity , they also remained silent . And that , too , was understood . Kaysinata gave the Little Turtle four strings of wampum . These he was to take with him along with the captives to Fort Pitt . Then he was to lay the strings across the knees of the commandant and say his say . The first string was to wipe away the captain 's tears , another was to open his eyes , the third was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English . The fourth belt was to cause the captain to remember it . Kaysinata made the little Turtle learn the speeches solemnly . Once more McArdle had to go out of the lodge to hide his emotion , but this time it was to laugh . The pains the good minister had taken with Salathiel Albine would not be in vain , he saw . The youth would be deliveredout of the hands of the heathen with his soul and mind82 THE FOREST AND THE FORT alive . " Blessed be the name of the Lord , whose ways are inscru- table . " It was spring now , but there was yet a chill in the air . The great flood had gone down the river leaving ice behind it . Part of the works at Fort Pitt had been caved in along the riverbanks . The commandant laboured desperately to repair them . The Indians gathered their tribes for the attack . Still Kaysinata delayed . Almost a month went by . One day word came by an Ottawa runner that nearly all the English forts westward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The DeTroit was besieged . Niagara was beleaguered , Venango attacked . Soon they , too , would fall . The surprise was dis- astrous and complete . All the English were cut off from their friends beyond the mountains . There could be no holding back now . The war belts passed through the forest and the tribes from the west and north closed in on Fort Pitt . The Shawnees rose like one man . Soon the road to the fort would be completely closed . Already the commandant was firing great guns at the canoes that tried to pass up and down the rivers . Kaysinata sent for the Little Turtle and McArdle in frantic haste . He called the seven captives into his lodge and explained . Mc- Ardle made a prayer to the Great Spirit . Kaysinata gave them new blankets and a little parched corn . He also showed them a long canoe concealed in the bushes , and gave a musket and powder to McArdle . By no means were they to fall into the hands of any passing war parties . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchers and into the fort . If necessary , they could stop with Nym- wha at his lodges on Sawmill Run until opportunity served . The fort was just across the river . Nymwha understood . He would help . To blunder now might cost the lives of the captives and bring down the wrath of Pontiac upon Kaysinata . Let them hurry , and they still might make it . McArdle was to dress himself as a half- breed Frenchman supposed to be bringing messages from the DeTroit . The Little Turtle was to go as the young brave he seemed to be . They waited in the lodge till night fell . At the last moment , parting from his son was not so easy for Kaysinata . He gave the Little Turtle a curious thing to remember . He told him never to eat turtle meat of any kind , lest it be the end of him . Then Kay- sinata put his hand on the sign on Salathiel 's breast and Salathiel 's on his own , and made him promise solemnly to return if ever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ancient tomahawk and they shook hands both with the left and the right hand . Thiswas a warrior 's dismissal into the world , and Salathiel felt that . Kaysinata had been a great chief . Now he was old . The moment was poignant . Malycal sat by , crooning . She also understood . She gave Salathiel a crucifix , which she made out of two hazel sticks bound together , and her blessing . She gave them all , the women and children , and even McArdle , " good luck " , and a cup of hot fish soup . Then she covered the fire in the lodge with ashes . They went down quietly as a cloud passes in the darkness to the banks and the black water of the Beaver Creek . The ice had now long passed away . The trees would soon be in full leaf . The owls bubbled and sang . A fish jumped in the water . No one said a word . The scared children had long since learned not to whimper . The women were grim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly . Soon there would be only black darkness in the tunnel of branches that met over the creek . As yet the far ripples of the stream still sparkled . They began to embark. 10A Marriage Is Recorded on Slippery ElmBarkTHE THREE WOMEN wrapped the four young children in blankets and put them in the bottom of the canoe . The women sat up . McArdle paddled in the bow ; the Little Turtle in the stern . They slid out onto the dark waters of Beaver Creek . For a moment they stayed with paddles poised while the current swung the canoe . The Little Turtle looked back . Kaysinata stood on a high point of land with a single pine tree on it . The eagle feathers in the chief 's hair spread out raggedly against the sinking moon . He wrapped his blanket about him with both arms and stood there darkly . The paddles dipped and the canoe slid forward . Presently it glided around a bend into the forest . Kaysinata vanished . Here and there the creek still glittered in the dying moonlight . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fast , little river ran like a twisting cavern through the forest .

Afterwhile , they began to hear the wolves howling along the bluffs of the Ohio , still many miles ahead of them . Sal Albine could see the cline figure of the woman who sat facing downstream in the forward part of the big canoe , the silver flash of McArdle 's paddle in the bow . But immediately in front of Salathiel was the blanket-draped shadow and dark head of a young girl . Her golden hair was done in braids and he could see the white glimmer of her neck in the V between her pigtails . That winter he had noticed her several times moving about among the lodges , help-84A MARRIAGE IS RECORDED 85ing one of the squaws dress deerskins . He remembered she had been singing at her work . It was a simple and monotonous little tune , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes , humming the theme . She looked back at him startled . " What 's your name , girl ? " he asked . " Jane Sligo , " she murmured . " Mine is Salathiel Albine , " he whispered . " I thought you were the Little Turtle , the chief 's son , " she said . " I 'm white , like you , " he replied . There was a pause while they paddled around the bend . The howling of the wolves was much nearer now . " Take me with you to the fort , " she whispered eagerly . One of the women looked back . They were both silent awhile . " In my blanket ? " he asked in a low tone , between paddle strokes . She did not reply . " Jane ! " he pleaded , whispering her name . The woman in the bow of the canoe looked back again . " Your mother ? " he asked , after the woman had turned and was looking ahead again . She shook her head and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He understood then that her mother had been scalped . " I 'll take you , " he promised . She put her hand behind her back and gripped his . Her hand was warm and soft , with little pads of calluses on it from grinding corn . He leaned forward and kissed her between the braids of her hair . Her hair smelled of pine smoke . They both sat silent now . The woman ahead did not look back again . They were nearing the great river . The canoe went forward into the night with sweeping strokes . In the bow the Reverend James McArdle began to breathe hard . His young companion in the stern was suddenly setting him a strong pace . Presently the night seemed to open up before them . A great stretch of sky shimmering with milky stars gave them the feeling of floating out into eternity . The stars seemed to blink together at the chorus of wolves answering one another from bank to bank of the great river . They floated out onto the calm bosom of the Ohio . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writhing branches drifted by , for the river had recently been in flood . On their right was a long sand spit that ran out like a white leprous finger into the black water that poured from the mouth of Beaver Creek . Five or six wolves were growling over something there . Their eyes dripped like molten coins . It was necessary to pass close by that86 THE FOREST AND THE FORTplace in order to avoid an eddy . McArdle and Albine plied the paddles rapidly . The dark bundles on the sand spit that the wolves were dragging about were the bodies of those massacred weeks before . They seemed to have gathered together at the mouth of the river . One of the women moaned . " Oh , God , " said she , " why did we'uns ever leave Lancaster ? It 's them there now . " The canoe shot by . They turned its bow into the current and felt the slow drag of the mighty stream against them . McArdle began to repeat the Twenty-third Psalm . The women turned to quiet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead there was a great waveringred light in the sky . Perhaps the fort was burning . A storm was brewing over in the east . The light of the flames beat up under the thunderheads . The little company crouched low and wrapped their blankets about them as the chill night wind sang past their ears . There must have been a hailstorm somewhere . Luckily there was no rain . On that reach of the river it was as clear as a new mirror . The dark mass of a forested island began to loom up before them . They would hide there all day and go on the next evening . The lodges of Nymwha were at the sawmill built by the English soldiers just across the river from Fort Pitt . They had agreed to go there first . It was at the mouth of a little stream called Sawmill Run . It would take them at least another night 's paddling to get there . The loom of the island seemed to float slowly down upon them . They beached the canoe and hid it carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They went inland into the forest under the great elm boughs that hung down over the banks . There was a high bank that leaned forward at an acute angle hollowed out by some ancient flood . It was dry there now and the ledge beneath was deep with half-rotted leaves . They sank down into the leaves thankfully . Dawn began over the river . The exhausted voyageurs slept . Sal Albine took Jane Sligo by the hand and led her off into the thicket . He knew a deep hollow under the roots of an ancient catalpa that had outweathered more than four hundred seasons . There was no wind now . The morning sun beat into the place gratefully , and bathed the erect column of the tree with pale golden light . The girl stood patiently , hanging her head in confusion while he spread his blanket for both of them . IIe pulled her down to him . They sank into a great depth of dry leaves that gradually covered them like the sands of time . It was hours later , and midafternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of his forest covering , the boy beheld the stealthy , alert face of a startled vixen looking at him fixedly over a neighbouring tree root . Her barking had wakened him . Jane was reluctant to leave her bed where the warmth of the sun had penetrated . It was delicious among the fragrant leaves . They rose unwillingly , and shook them off . They returned through the woods and found McArdle and the two women and young children sitting about a smokeless fire of chestnut burrs in the shelter of the bank . They were picking bare the bones of a wild turkey . Something about them reminded young Albine of the wolves on the sand spit of the night before . He andJane stopped for a moment , standing hand in hand . " There they are , " said the woman who had kept looking back at them the night before in the canoe . " I told you so ! She 's nothing but a blanket girl . I heard 'm whisperin ' last night . Jane Sligo , ye young slut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised a branch angrily . " What 's the matter with the white squaw ? " Albine asked McArdlein the Indian tongue . The face of the woman reminded him of the face of the fox that had recently looked at him . " Is she angry because no one has slept with her ? " " Her husband 's dead , " replied McArdle . Jane tried to smile at the children and the other women by the fire . " We were only bundlin ' , " she said apologetically . " Ye lie ! " shrieked the woman , waving the branch threateningly . " Look at your blanket . Ye lie ! I know ya ! " She advanced on the girl and would have beaten her , but Albine snatched the branch from her hand and shoved her away . He looked appealingly at McArdle . Meanwhile , the other woman shoved Jane from the fire when she tried to approach it . " Keep your hands off them children , " she said . " There 's no place for the likes of you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juty toward them pore innocents whose mar was murdered , and I wo n't have no trash from the settlements that beds down in a Injun 's blanket in the woods tryin ' to pretend t ' mother ' em . " Jane had turned pale now . She covered her face with her hands and wept . " The young man is white , " said McArdle . " What ! " said both women . " What ! " " His people must have been from Connecticut . They 're good old stock there , " insisted McArdle . The women sniffed . " Why do n't you make it right then ? " said the lady . " You 're a minister , be n't ya ? " McArdle nodded . " I 'd thought of it , " he admitted , " but it seemed sudden . " 88 TILE FOREST AND THE FORT " Not soon enough , " sniffed the lady . " That 's what I say , " added the Fox . Jane sobbed . The boy with with the Indian topknot stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reverend James McArdle suddenly , " you 'll be after getting married ! Are you willing , Jane ? " The girl rose slowly from beside the fire where she had been crouching . She looked her tormentors in the face . " I 'll not be pushed away from the fire by no old women like you , " she said . She came over and stood beside young Albine . McArdle took out his tattered Bible and joined their hands over it . The Fox took a thin ring from her finger . " Here , " she said , and tossed the ring to McArdle . " I 'll not be needin ' it much longer . I 'll never see the settlements agin . I 've got a lump in my breast . The crab 's eating into my heart . " She began to weep . The children looked on , wide-eyed . Both the women cried while McArdle married Jane and Salathiel . He married them with a broad Scotch-Irish accent , with the Presbyterian service , and the sick woman 's ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wolf cubs . After it was over Jane gave Salathiel a peck on the cheek and went and sat down by the fire . The Fox moved over for her now . She took the girl 's hand and fondled it . She looked at the ring on Jane 's finger and wept again . " It brought me good luck oncet . That 's why I guv it yer , " she choked . Jane tried to thank her . McArdle sat on the end of a log reading his Bible . He felt he had done a good morning 's work . Salathiel busied himself baking some corncakes on hot stones . There was no salt , but they broke the marriage bread together thankfully and with friendly smiles . McArdle traced something with his fish-gall ink on a piece of his precious bark . The " lady " signed it , and the Fox made her mark . The minister also signed it and gave it to Jane , who could read . After she spelled it out she put it carefully in her bosom . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been wrong with Jane that the women had worried her so ? She was a good girl . She had been happy with him . It had all gone very well and easily . He knew he was a man now . He felt contented and satisfied , but not a little puzzled . White ways were curious . He went down and drank his belly full of river water and washed the paint off his face . Let them see he was not an Indian . Jane was delighted with him when he came back . She put her arms around him and kissed him . He smiled at her and held her hand . She would make him a good squaw . On the whole , he liked her . Outside Looking InAT NIGHT , after the moon sank , they launched the canoe and pushed on up the river again . There were not so many wolves now . Miles ahead , as they swept around a bend , came a new sound , distantbut unmistakable . It was the barking of European dogs at the fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It lay only a few miles farther upriver , but beyond an island . In the darkness of the morning hours they heard rifle fire . Once the river gorge echoed to the bellowing of a great gun . The point between the two rivers , where the fort stood , was overlooked by towering cliffs . Another hour of darkness and they might have made it , but there was a clear reach of water ahead and the dawn was upon them . It was plain that if they tried to make a dash for it they would be fired on by the fort . In the fog , before the sun rose , they saw the bright flash of hand grenades being thrown into the ditch on the Monongahela side . They were also aware now of many canoes making across both rivers away from the fort in the mist as the light grew brighter . All night the Indians crept close to harass the garrison . With the day they retreated to the opposite banks or lay concealed in hollows close under the walls of the fort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Great Forks . Once a canoe came drifting downriver and quite near them in the mist . It came near enough to hail , and Salathiel replied in the Shawnee tongue . It was a scalping party of Mingoes returning to the Beaver from the Pennsylvania settlements . Albine knew who they were . He let them pass without discovering himself . They gave the death helloo twice and passed triumphantly westward down8990 THE FOREST AND THE FORTthe river . It was a close call . The women cowered down in the canoe . The children whimpered . The mist had saved them . McArdle encouraged them , telling them their journey was near its end . Presently they turned aside toward the south bank and made their way into a deep creek that came down out of the hills . A brief distance behind , the land towered up in a series of cliffs to the plateau above . A short reach of level bank hereabouts was covered with huge and ancient trees . It was here that the English had built their sawmill at the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could still see its roof rising black above the fog . The lodges of Nymwha and his squaws lay a half mile farther upstream on the banks of Sawmill Run . They arrived at the camp shortly after the sun began peering into the river valley and licking up the mists . The guns from the fort spoke . They were firing at any canoes they could see , and spraying the banks opposite the fort with grapeshot . The commandant was a careful man . He began each new day with a fusillade as a matter of routine . There was no one , besides the chief himself , but the three squaws and the two papooses at the lodges of Nymwha . The creek and the gorge of it was now his winter hunting and camping ground . He received the message of his half-brother Kaysinata with approval and regaled the party with dried venison and hoecake . Nymwha also had recently sent wampum to the fort to make his private peace . The English , he said , would soon be coming over the mountains with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Carlisle . Of what use , then , to howl like wolves outside their palisades ? Those who climbed the stockades only fell inside upon bayonets . Their scalps were even now nailed to the gate of the fort . Nymwha and his half-brother saw eye to eye . It would not be easy to gain admittance to the fort . By day they fired the cannon at canoes that tried to pass it or that approachedtoo near . At night they fired from the ramparts at the slightest noise in the ditch beneath . The Indians all about were lying in wait for refugees trying to gain the fort . Nymwha assured McArdle that the matter of getting their little party into the place would have to be well planned and considered . Nymwha smoked a pipe upon it . He passed the smoke to Salathiel , who also looked thoughtful and blew the smoke in two streams from his nostrils . Nymwha advised Salathiel to go and see the lay of the land about the fort for himself . Also , at the sawmill , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was , too , a sunken boat concealed at the mouth of the creek . Nymwha had burned neither the soldiers nor the mill . He had even sent food to the soldiers . Let the Little Turtle tell the Commandant Ecuyer that whenOUTSIDE LOOKING IN 9 ' he reached the fort . Let him consider well and act . Meanwhile the white captives would be hidden and safe . Nymwha knocked the ashes from his pipe . He had spoken . Albine went and slept with Jane . He slept all morning , rose , and ate heavily . Then he put the paint of a Shawnee warrior on his face again . That afternoon he and McArdle climbed the hills above Sawmill Run and looked along the three rivers and down on the fort . The place lay nearly a thousand feet below them , spread out like a green map . The Allegheny , or the Aligwissippi , as the Delawares called it , and the Monongahela swept together just below them to make the broad Ohio . The rivers were about half a mile wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort . The English flag flaunted brightly in the sun from a mastlike flagpole with spars upon it . The bronze and brasses of the cannon glittered . The place swarmed with people . They were driving the cattle out to pasture into the fields east of the fort with strong supportingparties of soldiers scouting before them . The houses about the fort had all been burned . You could see the fresh scars of the burning upon the riverbanks . That had probablybeen done by the commandant 's orders , for in the upper town that stood farther away up the flat at the foot of a high hill , some houses were still left standing . There were cultivated fields there , roads and tracks that led eastward . Women were going into the fields with sickles , with a company of riflemen before them , to cut spelts . A wagon raised the dust with a small party going out for firewood . Smoke rose from the chimneys of the barracks in the star-shaped fort and hung there like a pall in the still air of the gorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lacy white of appleblossoms stood out against the tender green of the leaves and lay scattered like snowflakeson the ground . Salathiel had never seen fruit trees before . Iie was greatly surprised by the " snow " . It was a warm day . On an island below the fort , on the other side of the Allegheny River , the skin tepees of an Indian encampment lay hidden from the ramparts , behind a small hill . Canoes were pulled up there on the beach . At a distance they looked like a row of black teeth . All of this , from the top of the cliffs south of the fort , where McArdle and Salathiel were standing , was like looking down on an ant heap . It was a view in miniature of inch-high horses and pea-sized men . But the surrounding country was gigantic . Along the river gorges , on every side , the ancient leaf-banked forests rolled away northward , eastward , and westward , like folds of solid dark-green velvet draped along the cliffs . And the white man92 THE FOREST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that huddled near his starshapedfort dark in the middle of its flashing moat ! His hateful , but magic activities lay spread out before the eyes of the Indians watching from the high hills along the gorges . You could see him in his bright scarlet clothes , his houses , and his glittering weapons . You could hear his dogs bark . The thunder of his cannon made the land quake . The heart of young Albine leaped within him . The fort at the end of the long point seemed to be aimed like the head of an arrow , pointing straight westward at the heart of the Indian lands . What would happen when the great king across the water loosed that arrow from his string ? Salathiel laughed . He despised his savage childhood now . Spread before him at his feet was the scene in which his manhood should begin . Down there was his white heritage . All he had to do was to cross the river and enter into it . Indeed and indeed , Kaysinata and Nymwha were right . They were wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take their wampum to the fort , deliver their message , and have done with them . He would take Jane there , too . Later , when the siege was over , they would go back over the mountainsto the settlements . All this came into the boy 's mind with a rush and an invincible determination . McArdle was excited , too . It was many years now since he had seen a white settlement . He explained , and talked , and answered a thousand questions . Secretly he was sad . He also longed to return but his conscience , he knew , would force him to stay with the Indiansand the captives . So they stood together , well hidden , in a thicket at the top of the cliff . Salathiel watched , fascinated , until evening came . The bland , smooth song of the bugles rose , echoing up out of the gorge . The sunset gun crashed . The flag came down . The dogs in the fort howled . Twilight descended . The fires of the fort , its yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cressets along the parapets flared . Finally , Salathiel turned away reluctantly to follow McArdle back to the lodges of Nymwha . Later that evening they went down the stream together to the sawmill and conferred with the soldiers . At the mill they found an English sergeant by the name of Jobson , and one Murphy , an Irish recruit . McArdle talked long with them both . He and Salathiel had a good plan to get into the fort . So they raised the sunken boat by moonlight and bailed her out to be ready to start . Salathiel was to go alone with the soldiers when the moon sank . He was to take the Big Turtle 's wampum , and McArdle'sOUTSIDE LOOKING IN 93bark tablets with the names of the white captives on them , and give them carefully to the commandant . It was finally agreed to make a dash for it after the moon went down , row across the river , and get into the outer ditch on the Monongahela side . Then they would carefully crawl up the glacis and call out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired on in the dark or of meeting hostile parties of Indians prowling about the fort . It would be an advantage to have the two soldiers from the mill along . Their voices would both be known to the sentries . The commandant was to be asked to send back as soon as opportunityserved for the women and children left at Nymwha 's lodges . A green flag was to be hoisted at the fort the day of the night before the commandant would send to fetch them . McArdle promised to stay until the boats came . Then he would go westward again into the Indian lands , he said . There were still many captives to see to . His release was not yet . Salathiel saw it was no use to argue with McArdle where his conscience was involved . Instead , he went back to the lodges to say good-bye to Jane . She took the parting calmly . " I 'm a married woman now , " she said . " I can wait . " She showed him the bark writing with the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding ring for good luck . Salathiel kissed her , and returned to the mill . While he had been gone , the soldiers had been busy muffling the oarlocks . When full darkness came they intended to row up an eddy in the Monongahela and cross over to the fort along a sand bar that choked the river near its southern side . Slowly the moon dropped towards the western hills . The soldierschewed tobacco and spat into the water . As darkness became more complete , a chorus of wolves began farther down the Ohio . At the fort the dogs barked and barked . The evening wore on . PART TWOThe Fort12Inside Looking OutSIMEON ECUYER , gentleman , captain in his Britannic Majesty 's 6oth Regiment of foot , the Royal Americans , and commandant of Fort Pitt , sat near the door of his quarters and contemplated , not without military interest and a Gallic eye for the picturesque , the scene in the interior of the fort that lay before him . He had moved that day into the " Governor 's Quarters , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the southwest bastion , which Colonel Bouquet had occupied some months ago , and reserved for his use , if and when he should return . The colonel had even left his camp bed behind , with a good mattress . But , as there seemed small chance that Colonel Bouquet would be able to return from the eastern settlements and lead the remnants of his sickly West Indian regiments over the Alleghenies to the relief of Fort Pitt for some time to come , Captain Ecuyer had taken advantage of a state of siege , and the excuse of necessity , to move into his colonel 's quarters . The captain was a professional soldier and therefore an adept at judging when such necessities arose . But he was also careful , and to salve his nice military conscience he had dispatched the colonel 's lame mare , now nearly well , fattened and newly shod , back to the colonel 's farm in Maryland , with nothing but a burden of her own oats and a letter . God alone knew whether she and the messenger who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prowling Indians and the wild Scotch-Irish on the frontiers , the king 's property and that of his officers in western Pennsylvania was ever of uncertain tenure . Even the dispatches were frequently stopped and opened . The good captain was tired of America . He was a native of9798 THE FOREST AND THE FORT INSIDE LOOKING OUT 99 Geneva . His mother had been a Frenchwoman of the impoverished Huguenot nobility , who had married a Swiss advocate , and Simeon , their only son , had been brought up on law , theology , the classics , and military history . As a curious consequence , he had become a soldier of fortune , a sceptic , and an officer whose native abilities could be appreciated only by brilliant superiors . They being few , his fortunes had languished . In the course of years and several services , he had grown patiently tired of unremarked success and unrewarded energy . Now he would have liked nothing better than to sell out his commission in the Royal Americans and retire to spend the re- mainder of his days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant conversation for which the shores of Lake Geneva and his native city were so noted . But he was still a mere captain , and as yet too young to retire . Only thirty-six , in fact , although he looked much older . And there was small chance of his being able to sell out . No one with money , and the influence that went with it , wanted to buy a commission in the Royal American regiment . It was all work and small pay in that service , and ungrateful work at that . Colonel Henri Bouquet , whom the captain had first met when in the service of the king of Sardinia , had lured his friend Ecuyer from a minor but promising post in the electoral household troops at Munich , by tales of the opportunities for active service and swift promotion to be had with the Royal Americans . They were to be a new corps with new blood and new tactics suited to warfare in the New World . Ecuyer had finally succumbed . He trusted and ad- mired the genius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle of Coni , and besides that , the colonel was a Swiss him- self , a native of Rolle in the canton of Vaud . Only part of the colonel 's great expectations for America had come true , however . There had been a great deal of active service in the bitter school of Indian warfare , and little more . Promotion , apparently pay itself , had all but ceased . Nevertheless , it was still a distinction and a joy to serve tinder Colonel Bouquet . He sue- ceeded where " great generals " had awfully failed . Indeed , he was the prime reason why Ecuyer still employed his own not incon- siderable talents in the service of King George , despite wounds , hope deferred , and growing poverty . One was constantly learning from the colonel . There at least one advanced in one 's own mind and profession , one grew . And what a rare sensation was that in any army ! For the rest of the officers in the Royal Americans the captain did not care  --  particularly . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foreigners in a foreign service . They at least obeyed orders carefully for the sake of professional reputation . But it was not always so with the bulk of the English officers who had come out to America with visions of easy garrison duty on a colonial post , only to find an Indian war on their hands . That was the worst kind of war in the world ; little honour , savage and mercilessfighting , incredible hardships , and fearful personal risk . A certainlack of enthusiasm among the older English officers was thereforeunderstandable , but to Ecuyer 's professional mind none the less exasperating . The subalterns alone he regarded as the grand hope of the regiment . They came from good families both in Englandand in America . They were the most promising material for soldiers the captain had ever seen . And in his time Ecuyer had seen a good deal of promising young material from East Prussia to Sicily . As for the rank and file , they had been raised as the act of Parliament forming the regiment had required  --  in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania . They were made up mainly of immigrant Swiss , Welsh , Pennsylvania " Dutch " , Irish , Scotch-Irish , Germans , renegade Quakers , a few frontier riflemen , escaped servants , and quite a number of mariners picked up along the water front at Philadelphia , men who would rather fight Indians and be scalped than linger to be flogged to death in the king 's floating hells . In this " Militia of Babel " , as the captain called it , the orders were given in English , and all by enlistment were made subjects of the British crown . That , the Mutiny Act , the hope of sometime being paid , and fear of the officers and the enemy , kept the regimenttogether  --  and one thing more . Something which it amused the captain to think all the historians he had read , except Caesar , had contrived completely to overlook . Yet it was one of the strongestand most patent characteristics of man : loyalty to one 's own military legion , esprit de corps . It was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was stronger even than self-preservation , religion , or patriotism . Now , there were a great many unfavourable things that could be said about the Royal Americans . The English officers and the War Department constantly said them , but there was one thing that outweighed all the rest . The Royal Americans had esprit de corps . Thanks to Colonel Bouquet , Captain Ecuyer , and a few others , they were at that moment the hope of the frontier , and of Fort Pitt in particular . In a sea of chaos , in the welter of disaster and confusion which had followed the onslaught of the hosts of Pontiac , they stood like a ribbed fortress on an island of rock. too THE FOREST AND THE FORTThere was an exceedingly simple , personal reason for this then vital military fact . In times of great crisis the " administration of events " tends to fall into the hands of a certain few persons . In the month of May , 1763 , it so happened that the defence , in fact the very existence , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily : Colonel Henri Bouquet and CaptainSimeon Ecuyer . They met the situation , of which they were aware , not only zealously but ingeniously , and they were followed and obeyed even by rascals and masterless characters , because by no means could either of them be bought , cajoled , flattered , frightened , or betrayed into doing anything less than his whole duty at any moment . They were in fact , as well as by law , the superiors of those they commanded . All this was more or less in the nature of things . For even if his mother had been a French noblewoman and left him a small pension in the public funds , Captain Ecuyer was a thorough Swiss , a professionalsoldier of fortune from Switzerland . Born a republican , he served the monarch to whom he had sworn allegiance with skill , honour , and a professional zeal that might have touched King George to the heart , if he had ever heard of it . But there was small chance of that , or of promotion , and the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had his personal feelingsjust the same . And he cursed quietly and fluently , but resignedly , as he ran his professional eye over the barbarous scene before him . Pittsburgh , as the settlers now called it , was indeed a long way from Geneva . Also the captain 's claret had given out . The last bottle was gone . He was now reduced to native , Monongahela corn whisky . Even the issue and the trade rum was exhausted . lle took a reluctant sip of the perfectly white , slightly oily liquid from the glass poised on the arm of his chair , and shuddered . No wonder the Indians rose against the English ! ' l'liis was a drink lit only for some hostelry in inferno . It seared the throat and caused the eyeballs to start out of their sockets like ships ' cannon from a porthole . Reduced to this potable lava , Captain Ecuyer nevertheless still wiped his brow with a fine cambric handkerchief nicely laundered . Thanks to the allegedly triune God , he still had Johnson ! Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook , washerman , and groom . And to think that they were going to hang Johnson in England for stealing a pearl-set pin ! Surely a gentle offence at worst ! But also , thank God , they had transported him instead to the colonies . What life on the frontiers would have been like without Johnson , Captain Ecuyer shivered to think . For the captain was now quite literally at the end of the world . INSIDE LOOKING OUT ioiJust over the Ohio bastion on the point , and across the Ohio River , began the pathless forests . No one really knew where they ended . They extended west , into the sunset , probably into China or Russia . Some geographers claimed they extended to the South Sea . Apparently , they were inhabited illimitably by the same kind of merciless devils as now surrounded Fort Pitt . To the mind of Captain Ecuyer , a thoroughly cultivated and European mind , the Indians constituted a ponderous problem in extermination . Personally , they annoyed him . Their manners were bad . Also they were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good soldier , he was being thoroughly practical about doing away with them , individually or in such numbers as might from time to time try to fall upon him . In this policy General Amherst himself concurred . In fact , he had already written Colonel Bouquet suggesting the use of Cuban bloodhounds , if they could be obtained , and the introduction of smallpox-infected clothing amongst the tribes . In any event , Fort Pitt was not going to be surprised or easily taken by the savages . Captain Ecuyer was the warrant for that assumption . Even with a mathematical mind , a military education , and a longing to return to Geneva , a keen and obstinate sense of the importance of his command was constantly present in the captain'sthoughts . Should Fort Pitt fall , the English might well be rolled back to the eastern seaboard . The post at the DeTroit , already in desperatestraits , would be cut off beyond hope , and the country west of the mountains lost , perhaps permanently . It would lapse back into the wandering keep of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone axes home , along with a collection of arrowheads and scalps . He foresaw the day when it would be convenientto have some tangible evidence of what would be , at Geneva , an otherwise incredible past . Meanwhile , the hope of English advance and perhaps the fate of an empire lay in the hands of Colonel Bouquet , who was gatheringhis expedition at Carlisle , and in Ecuyer 's hands at Fort Pitt . Both the colonel and the captain were keen enough to know that . They were also Gallic enough to laugh wryly in their letters to each other over the fact that the English empery in America depended , for the time being , upon two Swiss gentlemen whom King George had hired to fight for him , and that no one in London would ever know it unless they lost . The restrained grin of their painfully official correspondence had something horribly factual about it that conveyed itself in the same way that the grim geniality and toothsomely sardonic expres-102 THE FOREST AND THE FORTsion of a skull comments in the darkness upon both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild contrary resolves , the terrors , and the conflicting interests of the harried frontiers , which made the task of these two Swiss officers so difficult , would someday drop away like flesh from the skull , leaving the bare bone of fact to make its own comment . Here , as elsewhere , the sword would decide . Night after night Captain Ecuyer poured out his thoughts in such letters to Colonel Bouquet at Carlisle and Fort Bedford , and the colonel in like manner replied . On the rough pine desk in the headquarters room just behind Captain Ecuyer the papers , pen , and wax had already been laid out by Johnson , and a well-snuffed candle lit . A bright fire of large square lumps of soft coal glowed incandescent in the chimney . Nights in the deep river valley were often chilly and damp . Johnson himself , a middle-aged man with a sleek bag wig , the bulging contours of an old servant , and a kindly face rendered expressionless by suffering , was starching and ironing his master 's lace jabots , spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To look into the log-walled room was thus to behold a delicate , lacy film of butterflies spread out against the glow of the coal fire . A greasy cloud of coal and wood smoke hung over the fort continually . Soot fell in flakes . Consequently , the process of laundering the captain 's linens , lace cuffs , and stocks was continuous ; the polishingof his boots , buttons , and weapons , endless . And Captain Ecuyer had three wigs . To these labours Johnson devoted himself , and to the grooming of his own equally immaculate exterior . The captain , or rather his physical appearance , had become religion with J ohnson . It was the last check of duty , devotion , and responsibility which still held him to the European world from which , in reality , the current of events was sweeping him farther away every day . Events had achieved and were achieving a new personality for Johnson in spite of himself . He was , in short , being made over from an Englishman into an American , rapidly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porter of sedan chairs , later a lackey , and eventually as the chief valet in a noble and ecclesiastical establishment in Exeter , the process of becoming a frontiersman , both mentally and physically , was an unexpected nervous strain . Who would have thought that the bishop would have transportedhim merely for borrowing her ladyship 's pin ? A lamb covered with pearls ! It was only for a servants ' ball . He had only been detected in returning it . But her ladyship had been all for having him hanged . Possibly he should have been more grateful to hisINSIDE LOOKING OUT 103Lordship for merely transporting him as an act of Christian charity . But Johnson was beginning to doubt that . The new country was putting new ideas into his head . The bishop of Exeter and his ilk seemed unnecessary and far away . Johnson was beginning to become an individual instead of a mere member of a class . He had been forced to do so , because in the New World there were occasions when he had to act for himself in situations where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . Already he was thinking of acquiring land and settling down . He was engaged to a young woman of property , Amelia Hart , a Pittsburgh trader 's daughter . But he had been most proper in his advances . Too proper , in fact . The Reverend Charles Frederick Post , a missionary , had publishedthe banns of Mr. Johnson and Miss Hart in three sundry places , on three separate occasions , which made the people to stare , it being such a strange and unheard-of thing . Then Mr. Post had departed down the Ohio before the ceremony was performed , leavingMr . Johnson to consummate his own union . The enthusiastic co-operation of the putative Mrs. Johnson had , however , greatly encouragedher triply banned husband . As a consequence , he had led a sort of double life , that of an accomplished European servant in the service of Captain Ecuyer at the fort ; that of an American in the log store of Mr. Hart and his daughter , until lately situated on the banks of the Monongahela just beyond the glacis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take his place , he had made up his mind to retire from the fort . But , under the circumstances , a satisfactory substitute was not likely to turn up . Johnson had been one of the best valets in England and the captain was fully conscious of his good luck in having retained him . He had paid his passage money when he arrived at Philadelphia , and thus saved Johnson from five years of indentured slavery . And Johnson was grateful for that . He found himself in a predicament between a comfortable servitude and the prospects of a fearful but fascinating freedom . Meanwhile , Amelia was having a child . Meanwhile , Mr. Johnson relieved his peculiar state of mental anxiety with nothing less than a fanatical attention to the details of Captain Ecuyer 's service and outfit , for much the same reason that solitary prisoners sometimes carve meticulous baskets out of peach stones . That was the reason Captain Ecuyer was able to sit on the edge of the Western world dressed with all the precision and attention to immaculate detail that would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the reason his boots shone , his gorget glittered , his wig had the mould of the metropolis , and his frill with a small diamond pin in it was stiff , but not too stiff , with starch . The gold104 THE FOREST AND THE FORTbuttons on his scarlet coat blinked in the firelight , and the Val lace from his cuffs drooped over his capable masculine hands . All this was not without its effect on the garrison . It gave the captain the right prestige and appearance of an officer of the line . It was an example to some of the slovenly colonial officers , and it set the captain apart as a being from another world quite properly endowed with authority amidst the dirt , grime , and impudence of the barbarous frontier population . Since the captain had nothing of the macaroni or the martinet about him , but was just and kindly without being either weak or vain , his outer appearance , thanks partly to Johnson , expressed nicely his clean and precise , his logical and capable mind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd policy had already been made abundantly plain to both the traders and the Indians . Perhaps the final element which implicated his successful defence of Fort Pitt was a tact which arose from an understanding of certain democratic principles then in actual practice in Switzerland alone . By accident of birth the captain was without the blind arroganceof social class . Perhaps it would have been better if King George had hired more gentlemen from the vicinity of Geneva . At any rate , for once , by sheer accident and good fortune , that sovereignwas being ably served on the frontiers of his empire by a civilized man . Nor was this a trivial and personal fact . For in the extremely neat gentleman who sat smoking a cigar in front of headquarters at Fort Pitt was temporarily personified the hope of endowing with the life of reality the colonial charters that ran , in theory , from sea to sea . The fort and hovels in his charge was the only gate through which Englishmen and Americans could then pass to get to the Indianhunting grounds westward . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons and all , was being carefully and fearfully observed by three little girls in pigtails , who held hands and whispered . A smile from the captain was sufficient to send them scampering back , scared but happy , to the bedlam of a casemate near the flag bastion which then constituted their home . " Scared but happy " might , indeed , be said to describe the generalspirit abroad in the fort . Rather happy tonight , for after a cold spell and a flood the weather was unusually pleasant . More importantmatters than the weather were about to engage the attention of the garrison , however. 13A Stone Souvenir Descends from HeavenCAPTAIN ECUYER had permitted his coat to slip down off his shoulders , and across the back of his chair . The moon , whose setting young Albine and his companions , at a distance of only a mile or two , were awaiting so eagerly , still obstinately poured its feeble light over the Ohio bastion . The interior of the fort was illuminated by it with a kind of unearthly grey light . Leave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain'scogitations might almost have been taken from a page in the Germania of Tacitus . In fact , the Germanic peoples were back in the forest again and the Celts were still with them . The fivesidedenclosure of the fort resounded with a cacophony of English , Welsh , German , and Irish . The captain thought in French . There was really nothing so unique about America , he told himself . The frontier of Western civilization had moved from the Rhine to the Ohio in about two thousand years . Meanwhile , to be sure , Europeans had forgotten what primeval forests and a barbarousfrontier were like . Yet they plunged back into them as though they had an ancestral memory of what were the original conditions of their home . It must have been something like this once along the limes between the Rhine and the , Vistula . The captain 's memory was a classical one , but for that very reason he thought in natural terms . Much of the old texts was illuminated by his own experience . It was the military angle , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , for instance , to try to conduct campaigns with garrison troops . That was always ineffectual against barbarians . What the English needed were field armies , ably led . And there should be plenty of effective auxiliaries . The Royal Americans were , . io5io6 THE FOREST AND THE FORTin fact , a sort of vexillation , if you cared to look at it that way . The English generals were unfortunate in despising the colonials . Braddock had been the Varus of George II . Probably the English would never recover from that campaign . It might be that there had been a natural and fatal wound for the dream of empire that day on the banks of the Monongahela . Their prestige , in North Americaat least , had gone . Snobbery in generals was the chief nemesis of empire . In the end , history is nothing but the tragedy of manners , thought the captain . The manners best suited to reality prevailed . In America , west of the mountains at least , people had been forced to become realists again . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature instead of man . But London would probably never understand that . It was two millenniums away . Here in Pennsylvania or Virginia , no one yet knew which , one could again read Ccesar with a genuine understanding . The man was full of excellent hints for Indian warfare . The captain , for instance , had just filled the ditch of Fort Pitt with small caltrops and beaver traps . They were excellent things for a moccasined foot to step on , or into . All the howls that rose from the ditch now at night were not ones of defiance . The fort was surprising its wouldbesurprisers . A Rhine bridge across the Ohio glimmered in the captain 's mind . There was plenty of timber to make one . He was going to suggest it to Colonel Bouquet . All the towns and settlementsshould be surrounded by stockades . Tiles or slate should be put on the roofs to turn aside the fire arrows . But how could anyone ever persuade the provincial assembly to appropriate money for such things as that ? He looked uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort . They projected temptingly above the ramparts . Their many chimneys threw off thick curls of oily coal smoke . The soot fell upon the captain where he sat . A low hum of life , conversation , the cries of children , the lowing of cattle , the constant and infernal barking of dogs , and the stench of squealing swine saluted the sinking moon and the captain 's ears and nostrils alike . There were five hundred and forty " mouths " , men , women , and children , including the garrison and the refugee population of Pittsburgh , crowded into the fort . Every casemate in the walls was occupied and glimmering with candles , torches , or lanthorns . The square windows of the barracks looked at him from all sides with rows of yellow eyes . Now and then a door opened , revealing a scene of crowded confusion within , and a glimpse of glowing coal fires . These fires went day and night , summer and winter . They were both the curse and the comfort of the place . Its inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel . People took coal out of the hill across the river and used it like madmen . There was no end to the coal . A military forge across from the gate was also in full blast . The hammers of the smiths and the muted ring of glowing iron on anvils seemed to fill the place with a clashing of harsh bells . Stacks of hay and provender rose everywhere like little hillocks , furnishingat once a perfect fire menace and the assembly points for cows , horses , and poultry . The loud flapping of cow dung on the flagstones , the pissing of cattle , the interminable trumpeting of geese , and crowing of cocks provided merely the comparatively hushed monotone accompaniment for the constant staccato of humanity that arose from the casemates where the families of the unfortunate settlers of burnt Pittsburgh now sheltered themselves . Somewhere an Irishman was apparently beating his wife to death . Babies squalled . Mothers screamed the names of their strayed offspring . Little boys played leapfrog . Lines of people were waiting to get corn meal and whisky from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissary rations were being issued to the garrison . There seemed to be no sign that sleep was in order at night . Against the silent loom of the dark forests across the river the Americans were unconsciously raising a defiant human shout . It was almost a shriek . It was the outstanding characteristic of the inhabitants , a constant disorderly and complaining noise . Not infrequentlyit became surly in tone . The garrison of Fort Pitt boomed and yelled at the moon . It would be better when the planet sank . Darkness would come and some of them would have to go to sleep then , thought the captain . In the early morning the Indians would creep in upon them . They attacked with fire arrows and hysteria . Guns , with them , were largely something with which to make a noise . Most of them were vile shots , even worse than the English regulars . Only the Americanscould use a rifle . They always fired it at something or someone in particular . The Europeans had not learned to do that yet . The Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped them . The captain rearranged his stock , and sighed audibly. it was his task , with only a modicum of authority , to bring order into all this chaos . The inhabitants had come into the fort only a fcw days before . Up until that time it had at least resembled a militarypost . Now it was the parade ground of pandemonium . " Tomorrow , " said the captain , " allons nous en ! " The reforms of administration which the captain had been turning over in his mind while he sat looking at the confusion before him now began taking shape in his thoughts in the diction of the orders to be written that night . Only in the clear area immediately108 THE FOREST AND THE FORTin front of headquarters upon which he was looking , about the gate , and on the walls and outer stockade was order visible . On the walls the cannoneers stood with smoking linstocks beside their loaded cannon . He could see the glow of their matches in the gloom of the bastions . Beyond , over the moat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the platform of the stockadewhich Captain Ecuyer had had built all about the glacis . Just at that moment he listened somewhat sceptically to the announcement that all was well , repeated twenty-seven times , one after the other by each sentry . The consoling thought was thus enunciated clear around the walls . At least the sentries were alert . The captain counted the voices . He stood there , and finally crushed the fire out of his cigar while he leaned forward listening intently . The moon sank , and the shades of night engulfed the pentagon of Fort Pitt . The place gradually became quieter . The dogs no longer howled . Now and then , in the alleys behind the barracks , they growled . The captain rose and wrapped his coat about him . Inside , Johnson finished and folded up the little mangle he had brought from Philadelphia , to put it into the chest which held his valet 's kit . The starch on the jabots was dry . He began to fold them neatly and put them into a small drawer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment as though suddenly frozen . Captain Ecuyer also was still standing just as he had risen with his coat wrapped about him . For at that moment a curious and demoniacal wailing began in the fields beyond the fort . The women camping in the casemates and lean-to huts arranged against the walls clutched their children to their breasts . It sounded as though a pack of wolves was being slowly burned to death out there . ' A graveyard chill crept along the spines of the sentries , who stood transfixed , peering over the pointed stakes of the parapet about the glacis . Ghostly glimmers of fire twinkled amidst the grass in the meadows about the fort . From these points , soaring up like rockets , streaks of flame mounted into the sky . Some of the sentries shouted . Captain Ecuyer saw the fire arrows fall like shooting stars into the fort . They plunged , hissing faintly . Instantly the shingle roofs of the barracks were alight with little spluttering tongues of flame . Pentecost had come with a vengeance . A babble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep roll of drums began to thunder , echoing from bank to bank of the three rivers . Under the penthouse roof , by the gate , the captain could see the drummers in dim silhouette against the lanthorns , moving their arms like automatons . The garrison turned out . Ladders were rushed to the roofs . Women formed a line and began passing buck-A STONE SOUVENIR DESCENDS FROM HEAVEN 109ets from the wells . The swish of water on the roofs became rhythmic . The tongues of flame spluttered and went out . A pile of hay burst into lurid smoky flame , and was quenched . A crackle of rifle fire began from the opposite banks of the rivers . The bullets whizzed and moaned into the fort . Here and there wood splintered . The tinkle of a smashed window light sounded ominous . Three wounded men plunged , with sickening crashes , from the roofs . The Indians wailed like lost souls . The fire arrows finally became fewer . Now and then from the stockade the sullen bump of a musket thudded into the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder . The crack of the settlers ' rifles was more frequent . Captain Ecuyer mounted the ramparts and took his stand by the cannon on the flag bastion . To the eastward , on rising ground near Grant 's Hill , a house had burst into flame . A crowd of Indians could be seen about it capering against the fire , and driving off cattle . They were nearly a mile away . The captain gave an order . Twice , under his direction , the matross corrected the elevation of his piece . Its thundering explosionshook the fort . At the foot of Grant 's Hill , the house , the Indians , and the cattle disappeared in an intense white flash and a rocking shell explosion that re-echoed from the woods . The burningtimbers of the house hurtled into a near-by thicket and set it on fire . The red glow , framed by the frowning forests , threw a kind of infernal dawn over the valley . From the parapets of the fort several cannon began to spray the country about with grapeshot . The rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the fort hung a low , dun-coloured cloud of choking powder and coal smoke . Except for the dismal bellowing of some wounded cattle , and the disconsolate lapping of water in the flooded moat , silence settled down as if it had sneaked back in the enveloping velvet darkness of a foggy midnight . The night and the stars above marched on . The captain made his rounds . Finally he stood watching the dark lines of the forests across the rivers that swept away , rocking along the clifftops into the slowly paling eastern sky . There must be nearly a thousand savages concealed there . He had estimated their rifles  --  hundreds of them . The prospect of a long siege was by no means a delightful one . He hoped Colonel Bouquet at Carlisle would hurry . Perhaps by this time he had been able to advance to Fort Bedford . Perhaps ? There were only a few weeks ' provisions left at Fort Pitt . The captain stood pondering that solemn thought . A retreatthrough the forest would mean almost certain death for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nowhere above suddenly plunged viciously into the muscle of the calf of his left leg . It was exceedingly painful , and the wound bled profusely . It was a nasty gash . He retired to his quarters to be bandaged . The men on the stockades began to throw hand grenades down the glacis as morning approached . They exploded in the ditch with a crimson splash and a bump . The captain tensely watched Johnson and the surgeon cut a stone arrowhead out of the calf of his left leg . That arrowhead would be the most cherished item in his souvenir collection , he reflected painfully . Suddenly he could see himself at Geneva , exhibiting it to his neighbours . The faces of many people he had forgotten surrounded him . He was sitting in a small summerhouse near the lake . The vision was extremely clear . He began to hear familiar old voices . Then he fainted . Johnson completed the work of the surgeon , who had been called hastily elsewhere . He poured can de Cologne into the wound . The smarting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cloak and laid him upon Colonel Bouquet 's camp bed . He poured the blood out of his boot , washed it , wiped it , and lay down himself on the floor . After a while Johnson began to snore . The captain shuddered feverishly now and then . It seemed to him he could see the future in the dark . Finally he slept exhaustedly . Outside an occasional hand grenade viciously punctuated the early morning hours. 14Portrait in Oils of a Young ScalpTHE ARROW which struck the captain was also like to have been the death of young Albine and his two soldier companions . It was plain to the garrison that considerable numbers of Indians must have crept into the ditch and be lurking in the shadow of the palisade . The news of Captain Ecuyer 's being wounded caused them to keep a doubly sharp and vengeful watch from the platform . The slightest sound from the riverbank , or the least suspicion of somethingmoving in the shadow of the glacis , brought spurts of rifle fire from the loopholes , or the earth-shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , before the little party of three dared even to leave the cover of the deep overhung riverbank by the point , where they had landed and taken shelter about midnight . There had been no trouble in crossing the river after the moon had gone down . They had simply rowed up an eddy to the bar , and then poled across . One could wade across at low water in the summer from the south side of the Monongahela to the point . It was just their bad luck to have chosen a night when an attack was on to try to enter the fort . When they were halfway across , the Indian rifle fire had broken out viciously from the cliffs on the banks above them . Also they were afraid they might be seen in a cannon flash from the fort . For that reason they abandoned the boat , and , crouching low , waded in on the bar that ran out from the point . Under the deep bank it was safe enough till dawn came . With daylight , however , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , and picked off . Yet if they stuck their heads above the bank now they would be killed by the sentries on the parapet . So it was the devil and the deep sea . They stood shiveringIII112 THE FOREST AND THE FORT in the mud for two hours , occasionally conferring in whispers . Jobson , the sergeant , eventually decided to try to make the foot of the parapet by crawling around the point into the " King 's Artillery Garden " on the Allegheny side of the fort . They started , having to swim once , and proceeded with infinite caution , for as they wormed their way through the rows of lettuce and red cabbages toward the deeper loom of the slope of the glacis they became aware of other forms crouching here and there in the darkness . Once Albine whispered something in Shawnee as a crawl- ing Indian overtook them from behind . A low grunt replied . The Indian crawled on . Presently a shot rang from the palisade and the Indian sprang into the air and crashed into the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still for an hour . Murphy , the other soldier , stuffed himself with parsley , like a rabbit . It was his last meal . The sky began to turn grey . The lurking forms on the glacis slipped back through the bushes to the riverbank . They heard canoes being quietly launched . Presently the three white men felt they were alone . Morning was coming on fast now . They could occasionally see the head of a sentry sliding , like a dark bead , along the pointed stakes of the palisade . Between them and it lay the slope of the glacis , and the ditch . It was still pitch-dark in the ditch . They were on the western side of the fort . Jobson wriggled up the slope with- out being seen , and called out . Young Albine and Murphy followed more slowly . " Do n't shoot ! " cried the sergeant . " It 's me , Sergeant Jobson , from the sawmill . Is that you , Leftenant Francis ? I know your voice . For God 's sake , call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . The lieutenant assured himself he was really talking with Sergeant Jobson . He took a terrible time doing so . Then he sent for a rope . It also was a terrible time coming . The three men on the glacis could now be seen from the parapet . " Hi , Murphy , " said a soldier from the platform , " have you still got your har ? Who 's that wid ye ? " " It 's a young white bhoy tryin ' to escape from thim red divils , and mind ye do n't tike him for one . An ' fer Christ 's sake , git that rope or we 'll all be moithered out here entirely , you with yer blath- erin ' mouth in there . " " Shut your own , " growled Sergeant Jobson , " and get you ready to make a rush . Here 's the rope now . " It came wriggling over the parapet , and fell into the ditch with a splash . The sergeant went first . He picked his way through the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn up , not without a good deal of difficulty . The rope came dangling down again . " It 's your turn , me bhoy , " said Murphy . " You 're a spalpeen . I 'll tarry . " A couple of bullets droned across the river and splashed against the parapet . Someone had brought a lanthorn onto the platform . Everyone on the palisade ducked , and cursed the man with the light . It went out . Sal Albine rose clutching his bundle of bark leaves to his breast . He put the thong that held them together in his mouth , and rushed for the rope . Out of one corner of his eye he saw the Indian in the ditch , wriggling , but he could n't call out . He had the thong in his mouth , and he must n't drop that precious list . He went up the rope hand over hand , bracing his feet against the wall of the palisade . He stood on the platform and began to shout a warning to Murphy . " Good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back . Then they heard Murphy scream . " Jasus ! Jasus ! I 've caught me fut in a baver trap . Howly Mither of God ! " The party of ten soldiers on the parapet stood looking down at him helplessly . " I 'll go back , " said Albine , and started . But it was too late . A form , painted black and green , with animallike red stripes on its face , rose out of the shadow of the ditch . It rushed upon Murphy where he was struggling helpless in the trap , and gripped him by the hair . A knife flashed . A horrible floundering and moaningfollowed while the Irishman 's scalp was torn from his head . He shrieked . The Indian rushed down the glacis and the death helloo rose triumphantly from under the riverbank . It was answered and reanswered eerily from the opposite bank . On the parapet SalathielAlbine , Sergeant Jobson , Lieutenant Francis , and eight soldiersof the Royal American regiment dressed in scarlet coats and white leather cross belts , stood shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been possible to fire at the Indian withoutkilling Murphy . Then someone threw a hand grenade . It blew Murphy to pieces . " You God-damned idjit ! " piped the lieutenant . A young soldier began to vomit . " Git back to yer posts , " roared the sergeant . " Do you think it 's a quiltin ' bee ? " The men scattered . Young Albine stood on the platform and looked out over the inner moat and roofs of Fort Pitt . In his nostrils for the first time was the faintly fecal odour of civilization mixed with coal and powder smoke . He was never to grow quite used to it . His nostrils expanded with astonishment and disgust. 114 THE FOREST AND THE FORT " Come on , me lad , " said the lieutenant . " I 'll have to enter all this in the orderly book . " They walked along the stockade platform in the growing daylight , and descended a ladder opposite the music bastion . The musicians were gathering there and the cannoneers preparing to fire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fosse that fed the moat from the Allegheny , and found themselves at the guardhouseat the outer gate of the fort . The guard was already drawn up awaiting the morning relief . In the increasing morning light their burnished arms and scarlet coats gleamed cheerfully . The water of the moat reflected impressivelythe frowning dark ramparts and cannon looking out from the embrasures of the wall . The place seemed armed to the teeth . From fifty chimneys the black coal smoke announcing breakfast rolled threateningly into the air , and drifted down the Ohio . The sun peeked over the eastern hills , its first beams saluted by the thunder of the morning gun , and a ruffle of fifes , drums , and trumpets . The echoes rolled grandly up the river canyons as the Union Jack rose over Fort Pitt . The heart of the young man dressed in muddy wolfskins , with the bark bundle under his arm , expanded with pride , hope , and astonishment . To the youth from the wilderness this bare outpost of civilization , the ragged panoply of European war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explosion in his imagination . His white heritage fell upon him at one swoop ; left him dizzy . He rallied to it with the phlegm of the savages he had been raised among . Inwardly he was amazed and excited ; outwardly he was calm and apparently contemptuous . " Can you speak English ? " asked Lieutenant Francis , for so far Salathiel had made no reply to anything he had said . " Better than you , " replied Albine proudly . " I can even repeat all the psalms by heart . " " Every Scotch rebel in these mountains can , " said the lieutenant wryly . Most of the people , lie noticed , had the accent and manners of the former age . They were all Covenanters except the Catholic Irish , and they were nearly all runaway servants . " What 's that under your arm , a Bible ? " the lieutenant asked . " It 's a list of white captives now in the western woods , " replied Salathiel , " and it 's for the chief here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Francis . He looked at the youth in wolfskins now with more curiosity and respect . " I have wampum from the chiefs for him too , " added Salathiel . The lieutenant nodded . In these parts you could never tell whoPORTRAIT IN OILS OF A YOUNG SCALP I15or what a man was . There were no certain signs of class distinction . He thought it best to take Salathiel to his quarters and give him some clothes and breakfast . There would be some wild tales of the forest in him at least . The lieutenant was bored . He missed the excitement of routs at Bristol , and you could n't bed with a girl in America without catching fleas at least . Eventually they gathered under one 's wig . He scratched thoughtfully . They were waiting for the drawbridge to fall . It soon came down with a crash , and the relief in the scarlet of the Royal Americansmarched across . The drums banged . The lieutenant saluted and dismissed . Then he led the way onto the little island barbican in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smell of corn mush , frying bacon , boiling pork , humanity , and cattle filled the air . The fumes from the chimney caused Salathiel to choke . Astonishment once more filled his mind . It had never occurred to him that buildings could be built of anything but logs . He had never seen anything but a log cabin or an Indian hut . The fort was a mass of solid dirty grey brick and stone . There seemed to be enormous numbers of people in it . The cattle also were amazing . He remembered his father 's ox that had once breathed in his face . All these animals looked monstrous . And the chief sound that marked the presence of the white man was the crowing of cocks . It sounded delirious . The lieutenant paused to unlock the door of his quarters . Salathiel stood lost in admiration over the ingenious contrivance of lock and key . He even stooped to examine it . " Come in , come in , " said the young officer impatiently . For the first time in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple enough place  --  a mere plastered cubicle of the single officers ' quarters , but to Salathiel it conveyed the impression of immense and inexhaustible wealth , prodigally displayed . There were three deal chairs , a bed , an officer 's chest of polished wood with a brass lock , and a painted table . A shelfful of books , containingnearly a dozen volumes , hung on the wall . Across from it a small cupboard displayed some pewter and a few pieces of china and crockery . There was a ragged woollen rug on the floor . Into this place , through a spotlessly clean window , poured the level rays of the newly risen sun , which seemed to Salathiel to gild the apartment with a kind of palatial splendour . He stood obviously lost in wonder and admiration until the lieutenant laughed . Lieutenant Francis was a young gentleman of talent and small income . The second son of a rich and titled English family , his commission in the Royal Americans had been bought for him in 16 THE FOREST AND THE FORTlieu of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some effects of elegance , had accompanied him . He actually painted a little . Two oil landscapes and a portrait of his sister , by no means despicable , adorned the walls . There were iron candlesticks , long clay pipes , and bottles on the mantelpiece . A white cloth with a set of military silver and steel knives was laid out on the table , and his servant just at that moment knocked on the door , entered , and began to prepare breakfast over a bright coal fire in the little chimney place . To cap the climax , the walls were plastered and a ray of sunshine , focused by one of the bottle panes , illuminated charmingly the white face of the young lady in court dress smirking at them all . All this at once assaulted the senses of Salathiel . He felt as though he had been suddenly translated into the lodge of Manitou . The young man in gold lace and scarlet , hanging his gilt-hilted sword on a peg in the wall , might have been the sultan of Golconda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Salathiel that a room could be smooth and white inside . He ran his fingers along the plaster in amazement , and left a smudge on the wall . " Sit down , " said the lieutenant , laughing . " No , no , in the chair ! " So that was what they were for ! " Hawkins , " continued the lieutenant , addressing his servant , " set another place for my guest . " The soldier grinned and coughed . They settled down to tea , rashers of bacon , corn bread , and eggs . It was now that young Albine , perhaps by sheer native shrewdness , hit upon a scheme which was to lead him to whatever modicum of success he achieved in life . Imitation was his only hope and defence . He began to copy the actions of Lieutenant Francis ' eating . He mimicked him precisely . He poured his tea into his saucer , blew upon it carefully , and swallowed it . It was to him a nauseous dose , but he downed it . Ile watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spoon . Ile managed not to spill anything . He thought butter was wonderful . He ate six eggs and a half pound of bacon . " That 's all we have , sir , " said Ilawkins , rising , with his face a beet color , from before the fire . " It 's the week 's supply . " " Buy some more , " said the lieutenant , tossing him a coin en grand seigneur . Salathiel blushed under his paint and mud . But what did these English live on ? Eggs ? The lieutenant made some hot toddy . He plied his guest , and both their tongues were loosened . They began to talk with instead of at each other . In the halfBiblical , half-learned jargon of the Reverend James McArdle , mixed with the idiom of the frontier and some Indian words , SalathielPORTRAIT IN OILS OF A YOUNG SCALP 117began to reconstruct his life in the forest in reply to the amused , but searching , questions of Lieutenant Francis . He did surprisingly well . Then he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang up between them as the toddy neared the bottom of the bowl . The young Englishman began to tell Salathiel about Bristol and Bath . Francis grew enthusiastic about Bath . " It would do you good to take a plunge in the hot springs there , " he said . " I believe you 'd come out a white man . Lord , I 'd like to spend the morning in the bath , myself ! " He scratched his wig dolefully . " Now then , " said he , " if you 're going to the commandant , you will simply have to have some decent clothes . Ecuyer dresses like a courtier . IIe 's the only man on the frontier who 's not hoppin ' with fleas . But before you dress up , I 'd like to catch you just as you are . Do you mind ? " Albine , of course , had n't the faintest idea what he meant . " Sit over there in that streak of sunlight , " continued the lieutenant . " Here , try a pipe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tobacco was excellent . The lieutenant took out his palette , a small piece of old tent canvas stretched on a frame , and some oil paints . He began to daub rapidly . The sunbeam shifted slowly down . the wall . Outside , a trumpet sounded , making his subject jump , and the tramp of marching men passed the door . The lieutenant painted on . This fellow , he knew , would never look like that again . And he was a specimen , a type ! He sketched in the head against a tangled background of dim forest and branches . Across it fell streaks of sunlight , high-lighting the big shaved head with its prominent ears , the topknot with an eagle feather tied to it . The face he did rather from the side . The large , piercing grey eyes , wide apart , the nose that swept down and finally curved in a little at the mouth . That was the really astonishingfeature . Or was it the hatchetlike lines of the lower jaw that gave him so much character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not for the mouth , the fine , big , white teeth , slightly pouting lips parted in a happy , manly young smile . That smile was ingratiating , whether it was unconscious or not . Certainly it was natural . On the costume Lieutenant Francis let himself go . Ile draped the wolfskin over one shoulder and put in the little red turtle over the heart . " And we will suppose it is summer , " he said . " The backgroundshows it . " He put a rifle gun in his subject 's hand . The lieutenant drew guns well . And he seated his subject on a stump whose roots wreathed themselves into the base of the picture . " No chairs down the Ohio ? " he asked . Salathiel shook his head , and laughed. 1 18 THE FOREST AND THE FORT " Hold that , " said Francis . He worked rapidly . A general enthusiasm glowed through him and seemed to animatehis brush . His hand seemed to have a life of its own . This was , by far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour was the hardest . It had a copper tinge under the grime . Perhaps he painted it too red . He put in the three white marks on the cheekbones , of the Shawnee tribe , and last of all the pipe with its curling wreath of smoke . On a stump in the forest his young hunter sat , smoking between shots . " Rest in the wilderness , " said the lieutenant . All that was needed was a wild turkey lying at his hunter 's feet . He would put that in later . He stopped , rather breathless and tired . A fit of coughingshook him . Salathiel could not admire the picture enough . He kept going backward and forward between it and a bit of looking glass on the chest . The picture , he saw , was how he looked to the young Englishman . " I like your likeness better , " he said . Francis laughed . " I see you will probably get on in this world , " said he . The lieutenant was pleased . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Salathiel added . The lieutenant laughed again . " I opine you will , " he admitted . " Perhaps you had better begin the metamorphosis now . " " What ? " said Albine , looking puzzled . Francis did not explain . He gave his new-found friend a piece of soap and poured out a basin of hot water . Ile showed him how to use the soap , and persuaded him to wash his face . The paint , the mud , the smoke of many campfires , and the bear 's grease came off . The lieutenant sat back enjoying all this immensely . His friend was white , after all . Looking in the glass again Albine could scarcely recognize himself . Ile looked at the picture half regretfully . That was me , he thought . Just then Hawkins came back with some clothes from the quartermaster , where the lieutenant had sent him . All this reminded young Francis of amateur play acting at home . Nothing had amused him so much for a long time . It made him a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He now contributed an old linen shirt , tied at the wrists . Salathiel then stepped out behind the quarters and had Hawkinsdash several buckets of water over him . He left the muddy wolfskin lying on the ground and returned to dress in the new clothes : a pair of soldier 's boots , knitted socks , half-leather breeches , PORTRAIT IN OILS OF A YOUNG SCALP 119and the lieutenant 's shirt . An old green coat , provided by the provinceof Pennsylvania for its militia , completed the costume . Only the boots were unbearable . He finally took them off and put on his moccasins again . " That 's better . They go with the topknot . But I 'd let my hair grow , " said Francis , who never cracked a smile . " Put the feather on again . It gives you a more respectable look . " Hawkins would have guffawed but , even in his moccasins , the young man stood six feet four , with narrow hips and broad shoulders . The muscles in his arms were pantherlike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guffaw . Anyway , at that moment the lieutenant sent Hawkins along with a message to headquarters . He returned shortly with the desired answer . Salathiel picked up the bundle of bark and his pouch with the wampum in it . Then he and the lieutenant set out together to see the commandant . Lieutenant Francis was filled with a kind of schoolboy curiosity , bordering on mirth . He wanted to see Captain Simeon Ecuyer confronted by young Albine . It would be something to tell at mess , where his reputation as a wit had suffered somewhat of late for lack of new material to embroider upon.
