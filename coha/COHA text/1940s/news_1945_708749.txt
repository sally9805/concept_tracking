txt A few days ago an organization called Allied Coal Headquarters moved from humble qbarters in one of the smaller Ruhr cities into a huge ugly palace here . This palace was constructed by three generations of the Krupp family on the outskirts of Essen , with profits made through exploitation of one of the world 's most thickly populated and richest industrial districts . The job that A.C.H . undertakes is bigger than any other established or projected by the Allies for control of the economic destinies of Germany . With the transfer to Britain of that portion of the Ruhr which American forces hitherto occupied , all the area 's 167 mines , together with the expansive brown coal fields in the Cologne area , fall under British military sway . Allied Coal Headquarters , therefore , is primarily a British military organization though it embraces many experts representing other United Nations . ? It Has A Big Job A. C. H. 's task is to see that the mines produce . what the Allies , presently through SHAEF and later through the Allied Control Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what coal is produced is loaded and headed to the proper destinations . Leaving non-Nazi German technical and administrative personnel at their posts , the Allied Coal Headquarters through agents at each mine will keep daily tab on production and loadings ; see to it that miners are properly fed , housed , clothed and paid ; fix a method for gradual revival of the industry and supervise finances within a program laid down from above . Should the Allies allow the Ruhr to recover its old level of activity , A. C. H. will control the production of more than 100 million tons of coal annually . It will also be responsible for the lives of more than 300 , - 000 German mine workers , besides many hundreds of thousands more that the mines employ indirectly .
