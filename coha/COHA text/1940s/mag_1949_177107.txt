FROM THE CITY , FROM THE PLOUGH ( 224 pp. ) - Alexander Baron - Washburn ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> The 5th Battalion , Wessex Regiment , British Expeditionary Force , was assembled in England in January 1944 and destroyed in Normandy six months later . From the City , from the Plough is the chronicle of its infantrymen 's life &; death . Published last year in Britain , the book was both a bestseller and a critical success . Some reviewers described it as the All Quiet of World War II ; others were reminded of Journey 's End . Critic V. S. Pritchett , one of Britain 's best , called it simply " the only war book that has conveyed any sense of reality to me . " Published now in the U.S. , it conveys , unabated , a sense of quiet reality more remarkable than any American World War II writer has yet achieved . <P> The Putative Medal . For the first half of the book , the story hops through the tense spring before Operation Overlord , landing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicaments : <P> Corporal Charlie Shuttleworth is grinding his teeth with anguish over his wife ( " the cow ! " ) who " jacked me in for a civvy " ; Major Maddison is exulting as his platoon-in-training comes crashing through a barbed-wire obstacle with blood running from their face scratches ( and he furtively pins a putative medal to his chest in the secrecy of his room ) ; Colonel Pothecary , a plain man , stumbles warmheartedly through his announcement of the invasion : " Well , my lads . This is it . At last . You know , I 'm damned if I know what to say to you . . . Eat when you can , and keep your bowels open . . . " <P> In the first days of Overlord , the members of the sth crash ashore in France , and death begins its steady tithing . Corporal Shuttleworth dies with a snigger : " The cow , she 'll get my pension . " Major Maddison , leading a rash reconnaissance into disastrous ambush , is shot by one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He rose to his feet . . . ignoring the bullets that squealed around him . . . They saw him stoop , pick a white flower from a hedgerow and fasten it , without haste , in his lapel . Everywhere in the meadow men rose and moved forward with him . " And so the bridge is taken , and so the Colonel dies , and so the battalion comes to " The Hill , " a point beyond Caen , where the Germans had held long and stubbornly . <P> The Winkled Guns . When the hill is finally taken , and the battalion is reduced to less than a company , the brigadier in command says cheerily : " I 've got a job for you . . . We want to get our armor on the move . . . but they 're held up until we can get infantry to winkle the guns out . " When the winkling is done , all that is left is " a pair of boots protruding from a roadside ditch ; a body blackened and bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed into the dirt ; a hand reaching up out of a mass of brick and timbers . . . " and very little else of the sth Battalion . But the British tanks , " their commanders standing like conquerors in their open turrets , " rumble through , towards Germany .
