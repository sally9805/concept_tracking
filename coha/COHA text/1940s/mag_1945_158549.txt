At the reopening of London 's National Gallery last week , King , Queen and ordinary art lover saluted old friends as Rembrandt 's Woman Bathing , Rubens ' Judgment of Paris and Titian 's Christ and Mary Magdalene . These and 47 other choice paintings were the first of the National Gallery 's treasures to be returned to London from the 300-ft. - deep mountain caves near Blaenau Festiniog , Wales , where they had been stored since the blitz . What with shortages of transport , return of the entire collection will take about three months . <P> Plans for the evacuation were made before Munich , and they were being carried out as Chamberlain made his declaration of war speech . In a single week 2,000 pictures were removed in 64 special railway container vans-first to country houses and museums ; then , after widespread raids began , to the Welsh caves . The caves were air-conditioned , equipped with a single-track narrow railway , and wired with a burglar alarm system . <P> By one of the ironies of war , the National Gallery passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only one gallery ( No. 26 ) damaged . Far harder hit were the British Museum , whose Greek and Roman rooms were destroyed by incendiaries in 1941 , and the Tate Gallery , which will not reopen for six months .
