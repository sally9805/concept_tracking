If any U.S. male needs proof that women 's hats are crazy-and that men get stuck for them-Benjamin Benedict Greenfield of Chicago is the man to see for evidence . At his Bes-Ben hat shop on Chicago 's plush North Michigan Avenue , he has sold hats with everything on them from dish mops to jewels at a minimum price of $37.75 , and an alltime high of $1,000 ( complete with an emerald and ruby brooch ) . Last week , suave , dark-eyed Ben wowed the ladies again with a fashion show for Chicago 's pet society charity , St. Luke 's Hospital . In the solemn spirit of wartime rationing , every Bes-Ben hat was made of kitchen utensils . <P> <P> There was a Dutch cap made of a kitchen towel , trimmed with four napkin rings , a cookie cutter and a tea strainer . There was a tricorn glittering with plastic cutlery , grapefruit knives and ice tongs , and a hat of a sponge pierced with iced-tea spoons . The queer fact about these hats was that they were all becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror . " <P> Ben makes money . In his highceilinged , mirrored French salon , the average sale is " over $50 " and the volume runs from 10-40 hats a day . His list of customers reads like an amalgam of the Social Register , Variety and Who 's Who in Commerce &; Industry* . In search of new ideas , he has made 40 European junkets , six trips to the Orient and four around the world . <P> Besides miniature bananas , palm trees and pedigreed dogs , Ben has also trimmed hats with models of penguins , reindeer , Ferdinand the Bull , Red Cross nurses , Chinese coolies with water jugs , and nude " Folies-Bergre " dancers . He is already planning for the 1944 elections : hats trimmed with elephants and donkeys . But his biggest innovation for the out-of-this-world hat business is his refusal to sell any hat exclusively . <P> For this bluff treatment of the women who pay $37.75 and up for a hat , Ben is rewarded with fawning affection . Last Easter 22 of his clients were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in his shop , complete with hors d'oeuvres from his own hat boxes , passed around by their assembled chauffeurs . <P> Ben Greenfield got his start 27 years ago in a $5-a-week selling job for a shopkeeper friend of his mother 's . Three years later he opened his own shop with his sister ( the " Bess " of Bes-Ben , now married and out of the business ) . Two years after that he had gone from one employe and a $35 rent bill to 22 and $350 . <P> Now he can afford to be offhand about his business-and to turn down dizzying Manhattan and Hollywood offers . When his clients ask him why he does not open more shops , he merely drawls : " What for ? I 'm in the wrong income bracket now . " <P> <P> *Such as : .
