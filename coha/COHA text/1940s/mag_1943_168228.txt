Malvern 's call ( TIME , Jan. 20 , 1941 ) to Britain 's Christians to reconcile their economic and social world with their religious principles has been all but muffled by the guns of war . But now &; again the ringing note still echoes , to the well-bred annoyance of political and religious Tories . <P> Said Malvern 's godfather , William Temple , who is also Archbishop of Canterbury , Primate of All England : " Our function is to watch the politicians , spurring them on by criticism of the existing order in the light of our principles . . . . <P> " We have got to find a way to effect the real marriage of state concern with voluntary enterprise . . . . We are bound to be concerned about housing , nutrition , social security , freedom from unemployment . . . that will cover nearly every proposal in the social and economic field . . . and keep us true as regards our main direction and deliver us , as nothing else can , from the hell we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume in our thought the function and position of that welfare itself . " <P> At the same meeting spoke up the Anglican Church 's second-ranking prelate , Cyril Forster Garbett , Archbishop of York : " The condition of many of the children from the large industrial areas is a disgrace to our civilization* Evacuation has thrown a sudden searchlight on the evils of which the majority of citizens are ignorant . It showed that there still exists a submerged tenth over which squalor , ignorance and vice reign supreme . " <P> *From Our Towns : Close Up , a new book about the British slum-children evacuees : head lice were found on 20.8% of the Liverpool children , 19.8% of the Middlesbrough children and 17.3%of the Manchester children .
