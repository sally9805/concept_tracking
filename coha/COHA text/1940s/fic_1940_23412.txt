" THEY ALSO SERVE . . . " A STORY BY MERVYN WALL O NE afternoon a middle-aged man walked up to the gateway of Dublin Castle . He had such a smart way of walking and held himself so upright that the policeman on duty had touched his helmet respectfully before he noticed the little man 's outmoded and shabby clothes . Mr. Carmody coughed nervously before he spoke . " I beg your pardon . Is this Dublin Castle ? " The policeman stared down at him as if suspicious of a joke . " Yes , " he admitted , " it is . " " I have an appointment with Mr. Watkins , " Mr. Carmody explained . " Perhaps you would be so kind as to tell me where I would find him . " The policeman looked him up and down and replied sternly : " There are seven departments of government in the Castle and a staff of over two thousand . " Mr. Carmody shifted nervously . " He 's in the Department of Fisheries . " The policeman moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signpost . " Go down there , " he said , " across the Lower Yard , round by the Chapel Royal , and when you come up against a blank wall turn to the left . " Mr. Carmody began to thank him , but the policeman went on without heeding him . " The Department of Fisheries is moving out to-day to another building , butyou may get the man you 're looking for if he has n't left . " Mr. Carmody thanked him again , crooked his umbrella on his arm , and walked through the gates . He crossed the Lower Castle Yard , glancing up at the black battlements of the Wardrobe Tower . He turned the corner by the Chapel Royal , gazing with admiration at the Latin inscription over the doorway . He did exactly as the policeman had told him and in a few minutes he came to a group standing about a door . Officials were hurrying in and out giving directions to some workmen who were loading filing boxes and bundles of papers on to a van . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterproof coats folded over their arms . " I beg your pardon , " he said , " could you tell me is this the Department of Fisheries ? " " Yes , " answered one , " but we 're moving out to-day to make room for Internal Affairs . Were you looking for anyone in particular ? " " I have an appointment with Mr. Watkins , " explained Mr. Carmody . " I do n't know that he has n't left . Try the second floor , turn to the right , and when you come to a fire extinguisher , it 's the third door on the left . " Mr. Carmody thanked him and went in . He mounted two flights of stairs and , turning to the right , found himself on a landing from which he could see quite a number of fire extinguishers . He was standing in a narrow passage , summoning up courage to enter one of the rooms , when a door suddenly opened and out came a heavy table and pinned him to the opposite wall . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed across at him in astonishment . When Mr. Carmody was released he thanked the workman and knocked at the first door he came to . A voice said , " Come in , " and Mr. Carmody hastily took off his bowler hat and entered . An elderly man was sitting at a table writing . " Hello , " he said , " have you come to move the safe ? " Mr. Carmody said he had n't , that he had come to see Mr. Watkins . " I do n't know that Watkins is in the building , " replied the elderly man . " You see we 're vacating these offices . Is there anything I can do ? " Mr. Carmody coughed with some embarrassment . " Well , it was about a post , " he said . " I have been looking for a job for some time past , and someone , a friend of mine , spoke to Mr. Watkins , who wrote to me to call and see him . " The elderly man looked at him severely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You must pass a qualifying examination and receive a certificate of appointment from the Minister . Besides , I doubt if Mr. Watkips . . He holds a comparatively junior position . " " It was n't a post in the Civil Service , " Mr. Carmody put in hurriedly . " I thought he might know of something outside in the city . I thought perhaps he 'd be able to give me some advice as to how I should proceed . " The elderly man looked at Mr. Carmody for a moment . " How old are you ? " he asked . " Forty-two . " The elderly man seemed to become suddenly embarrassed . " You better wait for Mr. Watkins , " he said . He led the way to the door . Mr. Carmody took his umbrella and followed . The elderly man tried to bring Mr. Carmody up another flight of stairs but he was prevented by two diminutive workmen who had got into difficulties with a large filing press at a place where the banisters curved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " It 's hardly safe to be out in the corridors . " Mr. Carmody agreed with him . " You better wait in here , " the elderly man said , leading the way to a room at the end of the passage . " III send in Watkins when he turns up . " Mr. Carmody thanked him and took the Liberty of sitting down on the edge of a chair . The room was small and ugly . There was a calendar on the wall with the day 's date , 27th January , 1922 . The only furniture was the chair on which he was sitting and a table littered with papers . Among them was a file of about forty typed pages of foolscap fixed together with a brass fastener . Mr. Carmody blew off the dust and read : " Suggested Scheme for the Industrial Development of the Ballinacorrig Oyster Beds . " He turned the first page and began to read with mild interest . An hour passed . He suddenly realized that everything was very quiet . He could no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , opened it , and put out his head . For some time he heard nothing , then he became aware of approaching footsteps , and a young man turned the corner and came down the passage reading a sheet of paper as he walked , so that he did not see Mr. Carmody until he was close by . " Hello , " he said in a surprised voice when he saw Mr. Carmody 's head . " Are you waiting for someone ? " Mr. Carmody told him about his appointment with Mr. Watkins . " The Department of Fisheries has moved out , " said the young man , " but of course if you have an appointment with someone no doubt he 'll turn up . " He was a friendly young fellow with ginger hair , and he seemed to have time on his hands , for he offered Mr. Carmody a cigarette and loitered , talking for a bit . " I 'm from Internal Affairs , " he explained . " We 'll be moving in this evening , and they sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're to occupy . That 's in case the Department of Arts and Crafts tries to grab any of our rooms . They 're in the same building , you see . They 're extending too . They 're getting some of these rooms Fisheries were in . " " I did n't know two Government departments were ever housed in the same building , " said Mr. Carmody . " Oh , Lord , yes , " replied the young man , " often . Just according as there 's accommodation . In this building Arts and Crafts were all mixed up with Fisheries , one room one department , the next room the other department . They 'll be all mixed up with us now . " " A very remarkable system , " said Mr. Carmody . " Ah , " declared the ginger-headed young man , " what does it matter ? We get to know our own rooms quick enough , and a stranger has only to inquire . " " A country 's civil service is a wonderful organization , " said Mr. Carmody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You see , it 's only a few weeks since the Irish Government took over from the British . That 's why all this changing of buildings is going on . And there have been practically no hitches . The Civil Service is n't really such a funny institution as people make out . It 's slow in its movements but it 's sure . " He went to the window . " I think I hear the Board of Works men arriving with the furniture . I wonder is this room of yours on my list . " He opened the door . " Number 107 . No . Arts and Crafts must be coming in here . " " I hope Mr. Watkins has n't forgotten that he made an appointment with me , " said Mr. Carmody , " I 'm sure I 've been waiting over an hour . " The young man hesitated at the door . " He may have been delayed , there 's so much confusion to-day on account of thestaff moving out . Might be worth your while waiting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry anywhere . " Mr. Carmody assured him that he was n't in a particular hurry anywhere and that he 'd wait for another while . " Good-by now , " said the ginger-headed young man and he went out . Mr. Carmody sat down again and , resting his head between his hands , went on with his reading . He was re-perusing Section 23 , which was not at all clear , when the trampling of feet and an occasional crash informed him that Government furniture was once more being moved . He continued to read until the sounds of activity came to the corridor outside . He listened for a while , and then as he was getting anxious lest Mr. Watkins had indeed forgotten him , he went over again and opened the door . Workmen were moving tables into the room next to his . An official stood alongside with a piece of paper and a red pencil in his hand . A workman came down the passage carrying a pile of papers . " Arts and Crafts stuff , " he said . " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What about the end room ? " asked another , " is there anything to go in there ? " The official read the number over Mr. Carmody 's head , " 107 , " and he consulted his list . " No . We 're not getting 107 . Internal Affairs must be moving in there . " " That 's all then ? " asked the first workman . " That 's all , " said the official , and without as much as a glance at Mr. Carmody they all went down the corridor . Mr. Carmody for a few minutes stood in the doorway , then he stepped back into the room . " That 's queer , " he said to himself , " this room is not on the Internal Affairs list and not on the Arts and Crafts list , and each of them thinks it belongs to the other department , " He sat thinking what a great organization the civil service of a country was , and yet how easily a mistake like that could be made . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the sky above the roof of a tenement house in Ship Street . It was growing late in the afternoon , the room was no longer light , soon it would be half dark . He knew suddenly that Mr. Watkins must have forgotten the appointment and that the right thing for him to do was to go away and call to-morrow at the new offices wherever they were ; but he found he was unwilling to go . His heart sickened when he thought of having to go out again into the chill fog of the city . He thought of the misery of his position , the heartbreaking search for a job , any job at all , and the interviews with successful patronizing men , which were such a hurt to his shyness and his pride . Christ Church Cathedral bell sounded its warning notes and then it slowly struck the hour . Four o'clock . He remembered his miserable lodgings where there was no fire and where the rent was not paid . He thought of the misery of having to go on living at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all go , " he said to himself , " at least there are hot pipes here and the room is warm . " He got up and groped for the electric-light switch . He took off his overcoat and hung it behind the door . Then he seated himself at the table again , with his head on his hands , and forced himself to go on reading . Half-past four had struck when he was surprised by a quick step in the passage and a knock at the door . A young man came in . " Good evening , " he said briskly , laying on the table what seemed to be a list of names . " I hardly know where I am with all this moving about of staff . What 's your name , please ? " Mr. Carmody told him , and the young man added the name quickly to the list . " I 'll be around on the thirty-first about eleven , " he said . " You 'll be here about that time , I suppose ? " " Here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday , the thirty-first . In this room . " " Oh , you 're from Mr. Watkins ? " " No , " replied the young man looking puzzled , " from Mr. O'Brien . " " Oh , " said Mr. Carmody , not understanding a word . " I 'll always be here at eleven , " said the young man . " Good evening , " and he went out briskly leaving Mr. Carmody gaping after him in astonishment . On Friday at eleven o'clock Mr. Carmody sat in the room at the end of the corridor waiting for the young man to arrive . He did not understand why he was to be there , but he believed it was all connected in some way with the original appointment made by Mr. Watkins . The room was unchanged , the table was still littered with abandoned papers . At five past eleven the young man came in , brisk as before , with a bundle of paper slips in his hand . " Good morning , " he said . " Awful work we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the staffs moving all around the city . Your name is . ? " " Carmody , " said the other , wondering what was going to happen next . " Benedict Carmody , " said the young man , selecting a slip of paper from his bundle and laying it on the table . " I 'll be here at the same time on the last day of next month . Good morning . " When the door closed Mr. Carmody gazed with amazement at the slip of paper . It was headed " Department of Internal Affairs Note " and it was a check for sixteen pounds . Mr. Carmody has now been in occupation of the little room for seventeen years . He comes in every morning about a quarter to eleven and reads the newspaper , then he looks at the ceiling and smokes cigarettes through a long holder until lunch time . He meditates at times on the vastness of a country 's civil service and says to himself that it is n't such a funny institution as people make out . The " Suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lies permanently on the table before him , lest by not appearing to be at work he should give scandal to anyone who may come into his room by mistake . He is very rarely disturbed , however , since in his second year he wrote " Private " on a sheet of paper and pasted it on the door . He feels himself perfectly secure as the officials of each department no doubt imagine he belongs to the other one whenever they chance to see him in the passages  --  that is if they think about him at all . In the afternoons he usually goes for a stroll through the streets or sits in one of the city parks until the evening editions of the newspapers come out . Sometimes he takes a week 's or a fortnight 's holiday , but he is always careful to be back on the last day of the month to receive a brisk young man with a bundle of checks . He has six years to run before he reaches the retiring age . He is beginning to worry about whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GENTLER TIME BY JESSICA POWERS O N A shrill street he mourns his nightingales Through whom love spoke ; he writes in weightless verse His anguish at the absence of the lark . I come to him , I bring him rueful tales That the small birds of indigence rehearse On the bare branches of a city park . Surely , he cries , where towers make wilderness , And stone supplants the moss , and song gives way To raucous speech , you must in tears confess A most unmusical and loveless day . My words torment him with the prick of arrows . Not soon , not ever will he understand That love may learn the accent of the sparrows , Having no larks or nightingales at hand .
