This collection of Grade A scrap steel , according to the Germans , is all that is left of a British tank force after a recent skirmish near the border between Libya and Egypt . The Germans were confidently preparing last week to add to their collection of junked British weapons . In reconnaissance-in-force across the Egyptian border , they drove two fairly strong tank columns into British forward positions to feel out strength , then withdrew them quickly . British strength in the Western Desert has grown greatly during the summer , and the British hope there will be no more landscapes like the above when the real skirmishes begin .
