Letters ' to The Times New Philippine Republic Filipino Economist Gives History of His Country TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On July 4 , 1946 , the Philippine Republic is born , with the United States as its sponsor . An American law , the Act of Congress of March 24. 1934 , brings the new nation into existence . The President has issued a proclamation recognizing the independence of the Philippines and withdrawing American sovereignty over them . The Philippines came under the control of the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War . By treaty signed at Paris on Dec. 10 , 1898 , Spain ; eded the Philippine territory of 114,000 square miles . President announced that . the American policy would be to develop the Philippines , the country and its people . There would be no oppression , exploitation or imperialism . The policy would be radically different from the colonial policies of other nations . This has been followed faithfully . Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress passed the first organic law for the Philippines . In it is incorporated the Bill of Rights with two exceptions : the trial by jury and the right to bear arms , which were both left for the Filipinos to adopt or not . In other words , the Filipinos since 1902 have enjoyed the same civil liberty as is guaranteed to the American citizen under the Bill of Rights . No dependent people had had that boon before in all history . A. government suited to the people was established . Filipinos occupied important posts . The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has always been a Filipino . The overwhelming majority of civil service employes were Filipinos . In 1907 the Philippine Assembly was inaugurated . Its members were elected by the people . Its first act was to appropriate a sizable amount for the education of the Filipino masses . The Assembly was , in effect , the lower house of the Legislature , and the Commission the upper . The members of the Commission were appointed by the President of the United States . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free trade was established between the United States and the Philippines in 1909 . That gave impetus to industries , particularly sugar , coconut oil , cigars , embroidery and cordage . On Aug. 29 , 1916 , Congress passed the Jones law . This placed the legislative power in the hands of Filipinos , re-enacted the Bill of Rights , and established a nearly complete self-government . The Chief Executive , called Governor General , continued to he appointed by the President of the United States . Commonwealth Created Finally , on March 24 , 1934 , Congress passed the Independence- Act . This law created the Philippine Commonwealth , with the President and Congress elected by the people , a Constitution drafted by their representatives and a Government 100 per cent Filipino in direction , personnel and policy . American sovereignty was represented by the American High Commissioner , who watched and was consulted , but did not take part in governing . It should be made clear that the Philippine Government has always been self-supporting , but the war has upset everything . The Government treasury is empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different fields of endeavor is just starting . But withal the future of the country is bright and far from gloomy . The challenge is to the Filipino leaders to mobilize the forces that would compel success . The 18,000,000 Filipinos are determined to progress and to make the new Government succeed . That is the chief asset . The material assets are , if properly protected and employed , capable of increasing the Filipino people 's national income of $1,000,000,000 five times over , giving the Government a possible yearly revenue of around $350,000,000 without increasing taxes . Recent Laws Congress has recently passed the following laws : An act turning over to the Philippine Government about $73,000,000 in certain taxes collected in the United States ; an act appropriating $400,000,000 to pay private persons for war damages and $120,000,000 to the Philippine Government for reconstruction work plus $100,000,000 worth of surplus property ; and an act establishing free trade , fully exempt from duty in the first eight years and partially so for twenty years after that period . In relation to these appropriations , two things should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive any lend-lease aid from the United States and ( 2 ) the Filipino participation shortened the war , saved American soldiers ' lives and saved roughly ten billion dollars in expenses . The amount of destruction in the Philippines is estimated at about one billion dollars . Recently Congress passed a law providing for military assistance to the Philippine Republic . Under a joint resolution of Congress of June 29 , 1944 , sites for naval , air and military bases may be reserved by the United States on Philippine territory . The plan is to build a formidable American military establishment . It is clear that , although the two countries have separated politically , their relations will continue to be very close , maintained as they will be by special economic and military arrangements and buttressed by nearly half a century of close relationships . VICENTE VILLAMIN . Los Angeles , Calif. , June 26 , 1946 . Juvenile Delinquency Expansion of Present , Facilities Is Deemed Necessary to Combat Problem TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Governor Dewey is correct and realistic in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems a our time . Whether or not New York is the first State to make the effort to integrate its resources to combat this problem might be challenged by other progressive States struggling with the prevention and treatment of delinquency . " It would tie helpful if the Governor would consider carefully what was implied by integrated effort in combating juvenile delinquency . Did he refer to the Youth Commission and the related legislative act allotting limited grants of funds to communities to do a job of delinquency prevention ? Just how effective has this Youth Commission been ? Very little has been said or reported about it . How have its funds been used and by whom ? It would be helpful to have a clearer aid more accurate pie . ture of the work done with the money made available . Just how much of it was used and which communities re ? quested an allotment would be reveal . ing . Were there communities that should have made every effort to secure funds for the purpose but did not ? ? If so , why ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no justification . In work on the problem of juvenile delinquency cooperative a ctiv. ity among the agencies dealing wilt : delinquents is absolutely essential There are some indications that we are moving away from the practice of giving lip service to such a conviction In some communities , schools , courts , social agencies , the police and other groups are struggling to establish a common ground from which to work to resolve the serious problem of delinquency . However , inadequate funds and lack of trained personnel have beer factors that have stymied those of is concerned with the problem . The Governor 's recognition of the problem and his interest in it should , lead to his support of requests foi probably five times the sum originally allotted . Such a sum will allow the various communities concerned to worth intensively with the delinquency prob . lem and enable them effectively to coordinate and utilize all available resources . Prospects for achieving a productive form of integrated effort will materialize and increase if sufficient funds are made available fot the purpose . This along with a community plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention and treatment of delinquents would then become more realistic . Nem York State can then achieve the position Governor Dewey believes it should hold with respect to the problem anc its solution . MURRAY SACHS . Rye , N. Y. , June 29 , 1946 . Safety Thinking Is Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK . TIMES : Let each auto manufacturer , parts manufacturer , gasoline and oil cons pany , as well as any other related organization , devote some portion of every ad , every letter , every manual and every promotion piece to safety thinking and safety driving . Let the motor industry declare war on the clan gerous thinking that leads to danger* ous driving . It is said that 50,000 people are killer annually through traffic accidents it the United States . This js an oper appeal to everyone to carry on an un . ceasing campaign against this unbe ? lievable phenomenon of sudden deatk and wholesale murder . Even if the auto industry should look at the problem selfishly , such a cam . paign is in order . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that there is a tremen ? dous market , but just the same , why not do everything to increase the army of potential owners rather than to allow this awful daily carnage to continue ? t DAVID M. MALOVANY . Newark , N. J. , June 28 , 1946 . Refuse Burning Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Is there any city agency that is responsible for seeing that the rules about burning of reuse are obeyed ? I understand that there is a law that prescribes that private incinerators must be burned only in the early morning and early evening , yet in the neighborhood where I live , which happens to include the Roosevelt Hospital , the air is filled with acrid , unpleasant odors of burning garbage every night around midnight . This is the time when it is most important to have the air wholesome , since people have their windows open for the night . MABEL H. WARD , New York , July 2 , 1946.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
