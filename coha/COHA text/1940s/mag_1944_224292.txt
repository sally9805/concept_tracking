Last week a black gentleman turned up in a captured Fascist internment camp at Ferremonte , presented himself to the U.S. Lieut . Larry Garcia , C.O. , then brought in another black gentleman : His Excellency Mangesha Woube , former Ethiopian Ambassador to Italy . Ever since Italy grabbed Ethiopia in 1935 , the Ambassador and his aide had been comfortably interned in a village near Cosenza . Happy and well treated , they did not want to leave , but Lieut . Garcia had orders to forward them to the Middle East . <P> Only available transportation to the coast was by boxcar , hardly suitable for an Ambassador . Lieut . Garcia proved to be a diplomat in uniform . Tactfully , he ordered a parlor car . As he knew all along , no parlor car was available . Next morning , with full protocol , Lieut . Garcia ushered the Ambassadorial party into a private boxcar , provided them with C-rations , and started them off toward home .               @ @ @ @ @ @
