The warm Mediterranean air around the little French town of Grasse was heavy with the fragrance of carnations , jasmine and roses . Working in quick-fingered teams , the white-bloused girls of Grasse filled wicker baskets with blossoms , carried them to the huge stills to have the odorous oils extracted . Combined and transmuted by chemists , they will be dabbed behind the ears of women throughout the world to multiply the risk of genteel seduction . <P> As the harvest continued at Grasse this week , the prospects of the French perfume trade were not as pretty as the blossoms . Of the many ingredients required to make men sniff with interest , the fields of Grasse produce only a few , and not enough of those . Citronella , civet , vetivert , santalol , ambergris , patchouli and a long list of other exotic products had to be imported from abroad , and they were still not arriving in France in anything like prewar quantities . Prices were staggering ; a kilo ( 2.2 pounds ) of musk is now 100,000 francs compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past few months 600 of the 2,400 French perfume manufacturers have gone out of business . Another 600 are expected to close shop by the end of the year . Most were fly-by-nights who set up in business during the war and filled fancy flacons with any sweet , synthetic smell-or colored water-that chemists could brew . They cleaned up , selling to the unsophisticated Nazis and later to the G.I.s . <P> Synthetic Glamor . But not all perfumers made easy millions by debasing their wares . Most of the old-line houses were reduced to using synthetic scents , which do not " stay " as well . But such houses as Guerlain , which colleagues in the trade call the " perfume emperor , " fiercely resent even a hint that they had adulterated their wares . <P> One day a woman stalked into Guerlain 's shop on the Avenue des Champs-Elyses . She had a complaint to make to the proprietor in person : " Monsieur , your perfume does n't smell as good as it used to . " One of the dignified old gentlemen who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If anything does n't smell as good as it used to , it must be you , Madame . " <P> When war cut off materials needed for certain scents , the Guerlains , Pierre and Jacques , jealous of the house 's 119-year-old reputation , stopped making them , rather than put out an inferior product . When bombers wiped out the Guerlain laboratory in the suburbs , they started mixing perfumes in the basement of their Champs-Elyses shop . No one but Pierre and Jacques and their four sons knows how the scents are blended . The Guerlains do the work themselves , use girls only to bottle perfume . For months the perfumes were rationed and G.I.s used to line up for a block to buy the 250 bottles a day put on sale . <P> But now materials are coming in again and the big copper tanks and brown bottles are filled with tens of millions of francs worth of extracts , which white-robed girls dribble carefully into flacons . The real secret is to use more natural than synthetic musk . As Jeanpierre Guerlain explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reeks with synthetic musk . It smells of tarts . It takes real musk to make a woman smell like a lady . "
