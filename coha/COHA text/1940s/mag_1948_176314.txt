Last week London 's Marriage Guidance Clinic presented to the International Congress on Mental Health ( see above ) , a " little Kinsey Report " based on a study of 1,000 married couples . Some of the findings : more than half had " basic sex problems " ; one-fourth showed " gross sex ignorance " ; only 25 had read a book of sexual instruction ; almost one-third of the wives were unsatisfied sexually .
