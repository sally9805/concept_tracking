txt Sidney Daily Telegraph Correspondent deleted 42 lines ARGENTINE RULER CALLED ' GANGSTER ' // self , signed with flowery best wishes . Between Santiago and Bogota , on my way back to New York , two attempts were made to steal that photograph from my luggage . On one occasion a " maid " had the photograph out of the case and was about to take it from the room as I entered . Innocent Man Is Killed A few nights before V-E Day I heard shooting near the Plaza Hotel , where I was staying . When I asked the hotel manager what it was , he said : " Perhaps you 'd better not go out tonight , sir . " Then he reconsidered and said : " But you 're probably used to a bit of warfare , so you may be all right . But be careful . " That was the night of the shootings in the Plaza de Mayo , when an innocent man of British descent named Ward was riddled with bullets by police as he entered the subway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in his clothing . But the full and true story came out when his brother revealed that Ward had no weapons , carried full identification papers and had never been involved in any way indisturbances . Ward 's riddled body was delivered naked to his brother two days later . I walked carefully through Buenos Aires that night . Mounted police with pistols and carbines were everywhere . No groups were allowed to gather anywhere . When I went to bed late , I could still hear the clip-clop of Colonel PerOn 's police as they patrolled the streets . Then came V-E Day , bringing a rash of flags on every building . The Government was good enough to allow this , provided that Allied flags were flown to the left of the i Argentine flag in every case . But the editor of the Critica also put up the Russian flag on his ing . He was ordered to pull it , down . He complied , but wrote an editorial complaint . Colonel PerOn moved quickly . ) The next day the editor was arrested and clapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions . All Dinner Guests Searched On V-E night Colonel PerOn really clamped down on the cap ital . Police were in the city by the thousands , and the " Gestapo " in plain clothes moved among the crowd . I had been invited by Don ald of Melbourne to attend a dinner of the Pilgrim 's Society given at the American Club . As I had plenty of time , I decided to walk . I was stopped by policemen and told that I 'd have to go the long way round . So I took a taxi and drove ' round , finally reaching the Plaza de Mayo . When I was near the American Club the taxi was stopped by five policemen . I was taken from the back seat and searched thoroughly , even to trouser cuffs , for weapons . Colonel Perlin was taking no chances on anyone 's starting disturbances in Plaza de Mayo that night . Eventually I reached the American Club . Everyone else attending the dinner had been searched also and no one was feeling particularly amused about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , personally , he is a man of the greatest charm . Sometimes , when talking to him , it is hard to believe that he is one of the few Fascist dictators left in the world . He has a keen sense of humor and most gracious manners . But he is one of the most ruthless men at large in the world today . The glib , clever answers he gave to my list of questions brand him as a man of great intelligence . Even his foes admit that . But the man who , looking me straight in the eye , stated that he thought England 's form of democracy an example for the world was the same man who had a few days before flung his former friend , Gen. Arturo Rawson , into jail for daring to question the PerOn-Farrell regime . The day after interviewing Colonel PerOn I flew to Santiago . I wrote my story and tried to get it transmitted . But the fear of Colonel Perlin extends across the Andes , and my story was not allowed to leave Chile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story to the Acting Foreign Minister . It was hopeless . Then I was told that there would be little chance of transmitting the story from Peru , either . So I accepted the inevitable and airmailed it to New York . Great Britain and the United States , by their recognition of the Farrell-Perlin regime , have consolidated , boosted and emboldened a collection of the most charming and dangerous gangsters at large in the world today .
