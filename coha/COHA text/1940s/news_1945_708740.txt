txt A full and fair judgment on the Hatch-Burton-Ball bill to revise the Federal labor laws will not be possible until the text of the measure has been carefully studied . The final verdict will probably be a mixed one . The bill obviously represents an advance over present legislation in important respects . But if it had to be accepted or rejected as a unit , all its merits would be more than canceled by one provision alone  --  that for compulsory arbitration . The labor union leaders , whatever their extravagance of language , are wholly justified in rejecting this . As William Green rightly declares , compulsory arbitration would be " the first step toward involuntary servitude . " It may be gravely doubted , in fact , whether a democratic government would have either the wish or the power in peacetime to force men to work for private employers on the conditions that it prescribed . , The Government may , of course , stand ready at all times to offer its services as a mediator in any dispute when both sides ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may on Iits own initiative ascertain the facts of a dispute and make them public . The Department of Labor already has the power and personnel to perform such functions . There is no good reason why they should be taken out of the Department and placed in the hands I of some separate board , as the new bill proposes . There are other questionable provi1 sions in the new bill  --  for example , some of those dealing with the closed shop . Yet while the defects in the measure justify union opposition to it 1 as it stands , it is obvious from the comments of some of the labor leaders that they object as much to the merits of the bill as to its defects . The bill tries , for example , to limit Federal intervention in labor disputes to those of a clearly interstate character in-volving sizable bodies of employes . It would let local governments have jurisdiction over small local disputes . Some of the labor leaders object to this obviously sensible arrangement . Above ap , they object to the efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wagner Act . They want to continue , in other words , to make it illegal under Federal law for employers to coerce , intimidate or even " discourage employes from joining unions . But they denounce in unbri died terms any effort to make it equally illegal under Federal law for unions to intimidate or coerce employes into joining them . They insist that the Federal law continue to give the unions special rights , exemptions , privileges and immunities that apply to no one else . But they denounce every effort to impose on the unions any corresponding responsibilities or duties . Union leaders can not forever hope to enjoy this completely one-sided Federal status . Its implications are daily becoming plainer to the public in the dictatorship of the Petrillos and the Lewises and in the uncontrolled activities of Communist infiltrators . The balance must some day be restored . The union leaders must begin to decide now whether they prefer to give up their special legal immunities and privileges , or whether they will accept along with them corresponding legal duties and controls .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
