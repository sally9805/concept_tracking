txt Congress , its individual minds , like those of most American citizens , preoccupied with the implications and possible results of President Roosevelt 's order to the Navy to shoot first when it encounters Nazi or Italian war craft on the seas , will resume active sessions tomorrow with several specific and important problems before it . But those problems , passage of the record-breaking $3,500,000,000 tax bill , consideration of the pending price control measure and the expected request of the President for a new lease-lend appropriation , - are overshadowed by the questions relating to the Navy 's orders to shoot on sight . These questions have brought surmises that Mr. Roosevelt might be contemplating arming United States merchant ships or requesting Congress to repeal the neutrality law , although it is said by some party leaders that he has made no such suggestions . But on these matters it seemed the consensus that nothing would be done until the direct result of the Navy 's orders became apparent ; until the " shooting " began . Possibility of a Battle In any event , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeal or modify the neutrality law so that American merchant vessels could go anywhere in the combat zones would face a stiff fight , although non-Administration quarters conceded that enough votes for the repeal could , be mustered in the Senate . A facet of the naval situation will get an airing by the Senate Naval Affairs Committee either Wednesday or Thursday . The committee plans to question Frank Knox , Secretary of the Navy , and Admiral Harold R. Stark , Chief of Naval Operations , about the destroyer Greer which was attacked by a submarine near Iceland on // TAX AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TODAY // Sept 4 and counter-attacked with depth bombs . This hearing is in connection with resolutions by Senators Nye and Bennett C. Clark , who seek to determine what orders were given to the Greer 's officers when the destroyer sailed for Iceland with mail for American military forces . Germany has acknowledged the clash but asserted that the destroyer was the aggressor . It is the House which cut its semi-vacation short at the call of Speaker Sam Rayburn . The tax bill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an informal agreement has already been reached on a compromise draft which would retain the Senate amendments lowering individual income tax exemptions from $2,000 to $1,500 for married persons and from $800 to $750 for single persons , and increasing corporate income tax rates by per cent . No formal steps toward adjusting differences in the bill as passed by the House and the Senate can be taken until tomorrow when House conferees are officially appointed . The unofficial ? agreement was reached by members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee who met several times last week as unofficial conferees . They win meet again tomorrow and presumably ratify the informal agreement . The lease-lend request of Mr. Roosevelt , it is expected , will be for $5,000,000,000 or possibly $6,000 , - 000,000 . Representative Clifton A. Woodrum , Democrat of Virginia , chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee which will handle the request , said that if it is received tomorrow the subcommittee will begin hearings early next week and that the measure should be ready for consideration by ? the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure to authorize the President to set price ceilings , which the Administration deems a necessary adjunct to increased taxes , curtailment of installment buying and other steps to ward off price inflation , is still in the hands of the House Banking and Currency Committee . The committee will further question Leon Henderson , chief of the price control division of the Office of Production Management . Witnesses tomorrow before the Senate committee investigating movie propaganda will be Jimmy Fidler and George Fisher , Hollywood commentators , who , it is reported , disagree with the cinema industry 's pro - British attitude . They were called on the basis of remarks they made in radio broadcasts allegedly criticizing the industry 's views . The group will probably question Nicholas Schenck , president of Loew 's , Inc. , Thursday .
