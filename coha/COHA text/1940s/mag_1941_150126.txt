Zions Herald , 118-year-old Methodist weekly , last week ably stated the case against praying to be seen of men : <P> " A few days ago , at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery , a group of Massachusetts women posed for a news photographer in kneeling posture as they prayed publicly for the defeat of the Lend-Lease Bill . . . . What was the manifest purpose of this prayer meeting ? Publicity , propaganda . ... It is high time that the church protested against the use of prayer as propaganda . If any man or woman believes in God and in prayer and is convinced by his conscience that the passage of the Lend-Lease Bill would constitute a calamity to the human race , let him use prayer in legitimate fashion and take his problem to the throne of grace in secret behind closed doors . Possibly God may reward him openly . ... It is not good for religion , it is not good for the nation , it is not good for any cause to have prayer degraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
