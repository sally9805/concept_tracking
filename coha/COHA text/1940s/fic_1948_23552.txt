CATALINA Novel in Three Parts . Part I W. SOMERSET MAUGHAM I T WAS a great day for the city of Castel Rodriguez and the inhabitants , wearing their best clothes , were up by dawn . On the balconies of the grim old palaces of the nobility rich draperies were spread . Their banners flapped lazily against the flagpoles . It was the Feast of the Assumption , August the fifteenth , and the sun beat down from an unclouded sky . There was a feeling of excitement in the air . For on this day two eminent persons , natives of the city , were arriving after an absence of many years and great doings had been arranged in their honor . One was Friar Blasco de Valero , Bishop of Segovia , and the other his brother Don Manuel , a captain of renown in the King 's armies . There was to be a Te Deum in the Collegiate Church , a banquet at the Town Hall , a bullfight , and when night fell fireworks . As the morning wore on more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here the procession was formed to go out and meet the distinguished visitors at a certain distance from the city . It was headed by the civil authorities , then came the dignitaries of the Church and finally a string of gentlemen of rank . The throng lined the streets to watch it pass and then composed themselves to wait until the two brothers , followed by these important personages , entered the city and the bells of all the churches rang out their welcome . In the Lady Chapel of the church attached to the convent of the Carmelite nuns a crippled girl was praying . She prayed with passionate devotion before the image of the Blessed Virgin . When at last she rose from her knees she fixed her crutch more comfortably under her arm and hobbled out of the church . It had been cool and dark there , but when she came out into the hot breathless day the sudden glare for a moment blinded her . She stood and looked down at the empty square . The shutters of the houses round it were closed to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to see the festivities and there was not even a mongrel dog to bark . You would have thought the city was dead . She glanced at her own house , a small house of two stories wedged between its neighbors , and sighed despondently . Her mother and her Uncle Domingo , who lived with them , had gone with all the rest and would not be back till after the bullfight . She felt very lonely and very unhappy . She had not the heart to go home so she sat down at the top of the steps that led from the church door to the plaza and put down her crutch . She began to cry . Then sud-denly she was overcome with grief and with an abrupt gesture fell back on the stone platform and burying her face in her arms sobbed as though her heart would break . The movement had given the crutch a push , the steps were narrow and steep , and it clattered down to the bottom of them . That was the last misfortune ; now she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for with her right leg paralyzed she could not walk without it . She wept disconsolately . S UDDENLY she heard a voice . " Why do you weep , child ? " She looked up , startled , for she had heard no one approach . She saw a woman standing behind her and it looked as though she had just come out of the church , but she had herself just done that and there had been no one there . The woman wore a long blue cloak that came down to her feet and now she pushed back the hood which had covered her head . That looked as though she had indeed come out of the church , since it was a sin for women to enter the house of God with uncovered heads . She was fairly tall for a Spanish woman and she was young , for there were no lines under her dark eyes , and her skin was smooth and soft . Her hair was very simply done with a parting in the middle and tied in a loose knot on the nape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kindly look . The girl could not decide whether she was a peasant , wife perhaps of a farmer in the neighborhood , or a lady . There was in her air a sort of homeliness and at the same time a dignity that was somewhat intimidating . The long cloak concealed the garment underneath , but as she withdrew her hood the girl caught a brief glimpse of white and guessed that that must be the color of her dress . " Dry your tears , child , and tell me your name . " " Catalina . " " Why do you sit here alone and cry when all the world has gone forth to see the reception of the Bishop and his brother the captain ? " " I am a cripple , I can not walk far , Senora . And what have I to do with allthose people who are well and happy ? " The lady stood behind her and Catalina had had to turn round to speak to her . She gave a glance at the church door . " Where have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the church . " The lady smiled and it was a smile of such sweetness that the bitterness seemed to fade from the girl 's heart . " I saw you , child . You were praying . " " I was praying as I have prayed night and day since my infirmity fell upon me to the Blessed Virgin to free me of it . " " And do you think she has the power to do that ? " " If so she wills . " T HERE was something so benign and so friendly in the lady 's manner that Catalina felt impelled to tell her sad story . It had happened when they were bringing in the young bulls for the bullfight on Easter Day and everyone in the town had collected to see them being driven in under the safe conduct of the oxen . Ahead of them on their prancing horses rode a group of young nobles . Suddenly one of the bulls escaped and charged down a side street . There was a panic and the crowd scattered to right and left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catalina , running as fast as her legs would carry her , slipped and fell just as the beast was reaching her . She screamed and fainted . When she came to they told her that the bull in his mad charge had trampled over her , but had run wildly on . She was bruised , but no bones were broken ; they said that in a little while she would be none the worse , but in a day or two she complained that she could not move her leg . The doctors examined it and found it was paralyzed ; they pricked it with needles , but she could feel nothing ; they bled her and purged her and gave her draughts of nauseous medicine , but nothing helped . The leg was like a dead thing . " But you still have the use of your hands , " said the lady . " Thanks be to God , for otherwise we should starve . You asked me why I cry . I cry because when I lost the use of my leg I lost the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved you very much if he abandoned you when you were stricken with an infirmity . " " He loved me with all his heart and I love him better than my soul . But we are poor people , Sefriora . He is Diego Martinez , son of the tailor , and he follows his father 's trade . We were to be married this day , but a poor man can not afford to marry a wife who can not struggle with the other women at the market place and who can not run up and down stairs to do all the things that need to be done in a house . And men are but men . A man does not want a wife on crutches , and now Pedro Alvarez has offered him his daughter Francisca . She is as ugly as sin , but Pedro Alvarez is rich , so how can he refuse ? " Once more Catalina began to cry . The lady looked at her with a compassionate smile . On a sudden in the distance was heard the beating of drums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to ring . " They have entered the city , the Bishop and his brother the captain , " said Catalina . " How is it that you are here when you might be watching them pass , Senora ? " " I did not care to go . " This seemed so strange to Catalina that she looked at the lady with suspicion . " You do not live in the city , Senora ? " " No . " " I thought it strange that I had not seen you before . I thought there was no one here that I did not know at least by sight . " The lady looked at Catalina softly , but did not answer . The girl was puzzled and under her eyelashes looked at her more closely . She could hardly be a Moor , for her complexion was not dark enough , but it was quite possible that she was one of the New Christians , that is to say one of those Jews who had accepted baptism rather than be expelled from the country , but who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed their hands before and after meals , fasted on Yom Kippur , and ate meat on Fridays . The Inquisition was vigilant and , whether they were baptized Moors or New Christians , it was unsafe to have any communication with them ; you could never know whenthey would fall into the hands of the Holy Office and under torture incriminate the innocent . Catalina asked herself anxiously whether she had said anything that could give rise to a charge , for at that time in Spain everyone went in terror of the Inquisition and a careless word , a jest , might be a sufficient reason for arrest , and then weeks , months , years even might go by before you could prove your innocence . Catalina thought it better to get away as quickly as possible . I T is time for me to get home , Senora , " she said and then , with the politeness that was natural to her , added : " So if you will excuse me I will leave you . " She cast a glance at the crutch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she dared ask the lady to fetch it for her . But the lady paid no attention to her remark . " Would you like to recover the use of your legs , child , so that you can walk and run as though you had never had anything the matter with you ? " she asked . Catalina went white . That question revealed the truth . She was no New Christian , the lady , she was a Moor , for it was well known that the Moors , Christian only in name , were in league with the devil and by magic arts could do evil things of all kinds . It was not so long ago that a pestilence had ravaged the city and the Moors , accused of having caused it , confessed on the rack that they had done so . They perished at the stake . For a moment Catalina was too frightened to speak . " Well , child ? " " I would give all I have in the world , and that is nothing , to be free of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego I would do nothing to imperil my immortal soul or that is an offense to our Holy Church . " Still looking at the lady she crossed herself as she spoke . " Then I will tell you how you may be cured : The son of Juan Suarez de Valero who has best served God has it in his power to heal you . He will lay his hands upon you and in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost bid you throw away your crutch and walk , You will throw down your crutch and you will walk . " This was not at all what Catalina expected . What the lady said was surprising , but she spoke with such calm assurance that the girl was impressed . At once doubtful and hopeful she stared at the mysterious stranger . She wanted a moment to collect her wits before she asked the questions that were already forming themselves in her mind . And then Catalina 's eyes nearly started out of her head and her mouth dropped open , for where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have gone into the church , for Catalina had had her eyes fixed on her , she could n't have moved , she had quite simply vanished into thin air . The girl gave a great cry and more tears , but tears of a different kind , coursed down her cheeks . " It was the Blessed Virgin , " she cried . " It was the Queen of Heaven and I talked with her as I might have with my mother . Maria Santissima , and I took her for a Moor or a New Christian ! " She was so excited that she felt she must tell somebody at once , and without thinking she slithered down the stairs on her backside , helping herself with her hands , till she got her crutch . Then she hobbled back to her house . It was not till she got to the door that she remembered there was nobody at home . But she let herself in and discovering she was hungry , got herself a bit of bread and some olives and drank a glass of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to keep awake till her mother and her Uncle Domingo came back . She could n't think how she could wait to tell them her wonderful story . Her eyelids drooped and in a little while she was fast asleep . II C ATALINA was a very beautiful girl . She was sixteen , tall for her age , with breasts already well developed , very small hands and feet , and before she was crippled walked with a sinuous grace that charmed all beholders . She had eyes that were large and dark , shining with the glow of youth , black hair naturally curling , and so long that shecould sit on it , a brown soft skin , cheeks of a warm rose and a red moist mouth ; and when she smiled or laughed , which before her accident she did often , she showed very white even small teeth . Her full name was Maria de los Dolores Catalina Orta y Perez . Her father , Pedro Orta , had sailed for the Americas to make his fortune soon after she was born and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Maria Perez by birth , did not know if he was dead or alive . She was a pious woman and every morning at Mass said a prayer for his safety . She grew angry with her brother Domingo when he said that if Pedro was not long since dead he was living with a native woman , or perhaps two or three , and had no intention of coming home . Uncle Domingo was a sore trial to his virtuous sister , but she loved him , partly because it was her Christian duty , but also because notwithstanding his grave faults he was lovable and she could not help it . Domingo Perez had been destined to the priesthood and at the seminary of Alcala. de Henares whither his father sent him took minor orders and received the tonsure . One of his fellow pupils was Blasco Suarez de Valero , the Bishop of Segovia , whose arrival in the city that day the inhabitants were celebrating . Domingo got into trouble at the seminary from the very beginning , for he was headstrong , turbulent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating served to tame him . Before he was twenty he had got a Moorish slave with child and when it appeared that his misbehavior must be exposed ran away and joined a troupe of strolling players . Thereafter , persuading his father to give him money , Domingo went to the law school at Salamanca and stayed for eight years , but he pursued his studies in a very desultory fashion . Poverty did not prevent Domingo from enjoying life . It may be that the two years he had spent with the strolling players had not taught him to be a good actor , but they had taught him other things that now came in useful . They had taught him to be a gay companion and also how to win at cards and dice . The period he had spent as a strolling player had inspired him with the desire to write plays and every hour he could spare from his amusements he devoted to this occupation . He had considerable facility , and besides writing a number of comedies , would often write a set of verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then present in the hope of receiving in return a present in cash . It was this knack he had for stringing rhymes together that finally led to his undoing . The Rector of the University for some ordinance he had passed had aroused the anger of the students and when a set of indecent and scurrilous verses at his expense was found on a tavern table it was hailed with delight . In a very short time copies were passed from hand to hand . Determined to revenge himself upon Domingo , the Rector took a subtle course . It was not difficult to discover the scandal Domingo had caused as a seminarist at Alcala , and the life he had led during the eight years he had spent at the University was notoriously profligate ; Domingo was a gambler and it was well known that gambling was a common source of profanity ; witnesses came forward who were prepared to swear that they had heard Domingo utter the most horrid blasphemies . This was enough to make him a proper subject for inquiry by the Holy Office . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep , the algu , nil knocked on his door and when he opened it arrested him . It would have gone hard with him but for one fortunate circumstance . Not long before , the Rector had quarreled violently with the Inquisitors over a question of precedence . They read Domingo 's verses and laughed with malicious delight . Tempering justice with amusement they sentenced Domingo to hear Mass in the audience chamber and to exile from Salamanca and the immediate neighborhood . He had had a fright and he thought it well to absent himself from Spain for a while , so he went soldiering in Italy and spent some years there gambling , cursing when the dice or the cards played him false , fornicating , and drinking . He was forty when he returned to his birthplace , and he came back as penniless as when he left , with a scar or two which he had got in drunken brawls , but with many recollections to entertain his idle hours . His father and mother were dead and his only kin were his sister Maria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a pretty child of nine . Maria supported herself and her daughter by doing the difficult and skillful needlework in gold and silver thread which decorated the velvet cloaks of the images , images of Jesus Christ , the Blessed Virgin , and patron saints , that were carried in the processions of Holy Week , and the copes , chasubles , and stoles that were used in the ceremonies of the Church . Domingo was not a financial burden on her since he earned money by writing letters for the illiterate , sermons for priests who were too lazy or too ignorant to write them for themselves , and affidavits for suitors before the law . He was ingenious also at making out the genealogies of persons who wanted declarations of purity of blood , by which was meant that for at least a hundred years their ancestors had not been tainted with Jewish or Moorish blood . The little family would thus have managed well enough had Domingo been able to break himself of his bad habits of drinking and gambling . He also spent good money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his return from Italy he had taken once more to writing for the stage , and though he never succeeded in getting anything produced he found adequate satisfaction in reading his compositions to fellow topers in his favorite tavern . H E GREW very ' fond of Catalina and took her education upon himself and taught her to read and write . He taught her the Articles of Religion and attended her first communion with all the pride of a father ; but for the rest he confined his teaching to reading verse to her and when she was old enough to appreciate them the plays of the dramatists who were then getting themselves so much talked about in Spain . Above all he admired Lope de Vega , who he declared was the greatest genius the world had ever seen , and before the accident that crippled her he and Catalina used to play the scenes they most admired . She had a quick memory and in course of time knew long ... 027.4w154.011 passages by heart . Domingo had not forgotten that he was once an actor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be temperate and when to tear a passion to tatters . But all this ceased when Catalina was trampled by a bull . Domingo to divert her still read plays to her , but the love scenes made her cry so bitterly that he had to stop . III C ATALINA slept for some hours and was awakened at last by the sound of her mother bustling about in the kitchen . She seized her crutch and hobbled in . " Where is Uncle Domingo ? " she asked . " Where do you suppose ? At the tavern . But if I know him he 'll be back for supper . " Maria lit the fire and set about making the soup , but Catalina could not wait a minute longer . " Mother , the Blessed Virgin has appeared to me . " " Yes , dear ? " Maria answered . " Clean the carrots for me , will you , and cut them up . " " But , mother , listen . The Blessed Virgin appeared to me . She spoke to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were asleep when I came in and I thought I 'd let you sleep on . If you had a nice dream all the better . But now you 're awake you can help me to get the supper ready . " " But I was n't dreaming . It was before I went to sleep . " Then she related the extraordinary thing that had happened to her . Maria Perez was an extremely pious woman , but also a practical one . She listened to Catalina 's story with dismay . It was so circumstantial , with such precise detail , that she would have been willing CO believe it if only it had n't been incredible . The only possible explanation was that the poor girl 's illness and the loss of her lover had turned her brain . " The son of Don Juan de Valero who has served God best is the Bishop , " said Catalina when she finished . " That is certain , " said her mother . " He is a saint . " " Uncle Domingo knew him well when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Be quiet , child , and let me think . " The Church did not look with favor on persons who claimed to have had communication with Jesus Christ or His Mother and discouraged these pretensions with all its authority . Some years before a Franciscan friar had caused a great to-do by healing the sick by supernatural means and so many people had resorted to him that the Holy Office had been obliged to intervene . He was arrested and never heard of again . And through the gossip of the Carmelite Convent for which she did work now and again Maria Perez knew of a nun who asserted that Elias , the founder of the order , appeared to her in her cell and conferred singular favors upon her . The Lady Prioress had forthwith had her whipped until she confessed that she had invented the story to make herself important . If then friars and nuns suffered for making such claims it wa , only too likely that the Church wouk take a serious view of Catalina 's stor ) Maria was frightened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " not even to Uncle Doming I will talk to him after supper and he v. decide what had better be done . N in heaven 's name clean the carrots or shall have no soup to eat . " Catalina was not satisfied with this , her mother bade her be quiet and d she was told . Presently Domingo came in . He not drunk , but neither was he sober he was in high spirits . He was a mar liked to hear himself talk and while had supper he held forth so end tically upon the events of the da interruption was unthinkable . IV D ON Juan Suarez de Valero was an Old Christian and , unlike many of the most noble families in Spain whose sons had married daughters of rich and powerful Jews , he could trace an ancestry unspotted by misalliance . But his ancestry was his only wealth . He owned a few poor acres a mile from the city . He was very poor and his marriage with the daughter of a gentle . man of Castel Rodriguez brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore her lord a child every year for ten years , but of these only three , all sons , survived to adolescence . They were named respectively Blasco , Manuel , and Martin . Blasco , the eldest , from his infancy showed signs of unusual intelligence and fortunately of piety as well , and so was destined to the priesthood . He was sent at a suitable age to the seminary of Alcal ? de Henares and in due course attended the University . He took his degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Theology at so early an age that it was evident he could look forward to high distinction in the secular clergy . Promise of high preferment was made him . But on a sudden , saying that he wished to live out of the world so that he might devote himself entirely to study , prayer , and neditation , he announced his intention f entering the monastic order of the ominicans . His friends sought to disade him , since the rule was austere , with midnight office , perpetual abstinence m meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing served I Blasco de Valero became a friar . His were too great to be ignored by his ' riors and when it was discovered that les a fine presence and great learning ad a voice both powerful and melodihe was sent here and there to preach . ? ne occasion he was sent to his old rsity of Alcal ? de . Henares . He had en a considerable reputation and tole city flocked to hear him . His i was sensational . He put forth all Durces to convince the vast conm of the importance of preserving T HOUGH still sincerely conscious of his unworthiness he accepted the post without demur . Valencia was a seaport and foreign ships , English , Dutch , and French , often put in . Their crews were not seldom Protestants and so were proper objects for the Inquisition to deal with . Moreover they frequently attempted to smuggle in prohibited books , such as translations into Spanish of the Bible and the heretical works of Erasmus . Blasco de Valero saw that he could do much useful work there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valencia and in the surrounding country ; they had been forcibly converted to Christianity , but it was common knowledge that with the great majority their conversion was but skin deep and they adhered to many of their Moorish customs . But they were industrious and not only was the agriculture of the country in their hands , but all the trading ; for the Spaniards were too idle , too proud , and too dissipated to engage in menial pursuits . The consequence was that the Moriscos were growing richer and richer and since they were exceedingly pro-. lific were increasing in numbers . Many thoughtful persons foresaw the time when the whole wealth of the country would be in their hands and they would outnumber the native population . Somehow it was necessary to get rid of them at all costs and several plans were devised to effect this . No one was more concerned with this problem than Friar Blasco de Valero , and perhaps the most famous sermon he preached during his sojourn in AIcal ? de Henares was that in which he proposed that the Moors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and old having been previously castrated , so that in no long time they would all perish . It may be that it was this sermon which caused him to be given the high and honorable post of Inquisitor at the important city of Valencia . F RIAR Blasco undertook his new duties with confidence , fortified by fervent prayer , that there was before him the opportunity to do great work to the honor of the Holy Office and the glory of God . When it became evident that the new Inquisitor was determined to exterminate the Moriscos the authorities of the city went in a body to remonstrate . They pointed out to him that the prosperity of the province depended upon them and it would be ruined if he continued in his course . But he berated them sharply , threatened them with excommunication , and so forced them to submission and humble apology . He succeeded before long by punishment and confiscation in reducing the Moriscos to misery and destitution . His spies were everywhere and it went ill with any Spaniard , lay or ecclesiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sermons he continued to impress upon the people of Valencia the obligation to denounce anyone who in jest or anger , ignorance or carelessness uttered a thoughtless expression it was not long before everyone in the city lived in fear . UT the Inquisitor was a just man . He was also a merciful man . It was not the death of the heretic that he desired , but the salvation of his soul . On one occasion an Englishman , master of a ship , was arrested and confessed that he was a member of the reformed faith , whereupon his ship was seized and the cargo confiscated ; he was tortured till his strength failed and then consented to become a Catholic ; it was with heartfelt satisfaction that the Inquisitor thus was able to condemn him to no more than ten years in the galleys and perpetual imprisonment . Two or three further instances may be given of his merciful disposition . Ever since the death of a penitent as the result of two hundred lashes , he had insisted on the scourging being limited to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant woman he postponed its infliction till after her confinement and it was his tender heart , rather than regard for the law , that made him take the utmost care that torture should cause neither permanent crippling nor broken bones , and if occasionally an accident happened and someone died as the result of its application no one could have more bitterly regretted it . Friar Blasco 's term of office was highly successful . In the course of ten years he celebrated thirty-seven autos da fa at which some six hundred persons were penanced and over seventy burnt either alive or in effigy , thus not only rendering a service to God but also edifying the people . A less humble man than he might have looked upon the last of these celebrations as the crowning glory of his career , for it was held in honor of Prince Philip , the King 's son . The various ceremonies were conducted so properly and provided the royal prince with so much entertainment that he sent Friar Blasco a present of two hundred ducats with a letter in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue thus to serve God to the glory of the Holy Office and the advantage of the State . The zeal and piety of the Inquisitor had evidently made a deep impression on him , for when shortly afterward Philip the Second died and he ascended the throne he lost no time in appointing Blasco de Valero to the bishopric of Segovia where he had made his arrival on this memorable day to assume his new duties . He had made the decision to accept this new dignity only after spending a whole night on his knees wrestling with the Lord and left Valencia amid the lamentation of great and small . He had won the admiration of the highly placed by his zeal , the austerity of his life , and his scrupulous honesty ; and he was worshipped by the poor for his charity . He received a handsome salary as Inquisitor and the canonry at Malaga to which he had been appointed was accompanied by a considerable income ; but he spent every penny on relieving the necessities of the needy . He never wore anything but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor wore linen or used it on his bed , and regularly disciplined himself , on occasion so severely that blood was splashed on the wall . V I T is unnecessary to deal at such length with the other sons of Don Juan de Valero . The second son , Manuel , was several years younger than his brother and though far from stupid was neither so intelligent nor so industrious . He was more interested in the sports of the field than in the acquisition of learning . He into a handsome , stalwart young Drew with great strength of body and man , an uncommonly good opinion of himself . He had dash , courage , and ambition . He was a great hunter and could ride horses which others found unmanageable . From his earliest youth he had played at bullfighting with the other lads of the town and when he was old enough never missed a chance to jump into the ring and play the bull . At the age of sixteen he managed to be allowed to fight a bull on horseback and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lance . He had long decided upon a career of arms , for at that time in Spain if you did not go into the Church there was no other way to advance yourself . Though MAGAZINE poor , Don Juan de Valero was highly respected and it chanced that one of the nobles of the city was distantly related to the great Duke of Alva ; and so one fine day , with a letter of recommendation in his pocket , young Manuel rode off to seek his fortune . He reached the great man at a favorable moment , for , banished from Court , he was then confined to his Castle of Uzeda . The Duke was impressed with the gallant bearing of the youth who sought his favor when he was in disgrace , and when shortly afterward he was recalled by Philip II to assume command in the war with Portugal he took him in his suite . The Duke defeated Don Antonio , the King of Portugal , and drove him from his kingdom . He seized a great treasure at Lisbon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs . Manuel acquitted himself bravely in battle and later , in the looting , picked up a good many valuable objects which he promptly converted into ready money . But Alva was old and near his death , and since the young man was eager to continue his military career he gave him letters to such of his old captains as had served under him in the Low Countries and who were now under the command of Alexander Farnese . For twenty years Manuel fought with distinction to regain the Northern Provinces for the King of Spain . He proved himself not only courageous but astute , and he was advanced first by Alexander Farnese and then by the generals who on his death replaced him . He was as unscrupulous as he was intrepid , as ruthless as he was able , and as devout as he was brutal , so that in due course he was given important commands . By the loot he acquired in captured cities , by the extortion he practiced on the merchants of the towns he administered , and by the granting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He received the coveted order of Calatrava and proudly wore its green ribbon . Two years later he was created Count of San Costanzo in the Kingdom of Naples . He had been wounded several times and the last time so severely that only his strong constitution enabled him to survive . His wound gave him a reasonable excuse to leave the King 's service and he determined to go home and marry into a family of the old aristocracy of his native town of Segovia , which with his rank and fortune he had little doubt he could do , and then go to Madrid where he could use his energy and gifts for intrigue to achieve his inordinate ambition . Who knew but what if he played his cards well , cultivating the right people , he might not in the end rise to great heights ? He was at this time forty years old , a fine figure of a man , with bold black eyes , a handsome mustache , an air of insolent virility , and an agile tongue . VI O F THE third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every family has its black sheep and the family of Don Juan de Valero was no exception . Martin , the youngest of the three and the last child that Doiia Violante bore her husband , had neither the fiery zeal that had enabled Blasco de Valero to reach eminence in the Church nor the ambition and dexterity that had brought fame and fortune to Don Manuel . He seemed content to devote himself to the cultivation of the few beggarly acres by the produce of which his father and mother kept body and soul together . Martin was a sad disappointment to Don Juan , and though his wife urged that there was a certain advantage in having a son who was strong , active , and willing to put his hand to any sort of work , he continued to chafe . But a greater blow was in store for him . At twenty-three Martin married and married beneath him . True , his bride was an Old Christian , the testimony was convincing that for four generations there had been no intermarriage with persons of Jewish or Moorish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his only child and would inherit whatever he had , but the fact remained that he was a tradesman . Some years passed , and Consuelo had children , and then still another blow befell Don Juan . The baker died ; Don Juan heaved a sigh of relief , for now the bakery could be sold and the stigma of this connection with a menial occupationmight be lived down . But no sooner was the baker decently buried than Martin informed his parents that he proposed to move into the city and run the shop himself . They could hardly believe their ears . Don Juan stormed , Doiia Violante wept . Their son pointed out to them that if they had lived somewhat less meagrely than before it was owing to the dowry Consuelo had brought him ; this was now spent ; he had four children and there was no reason why he should not have four more ; cash was scarce in Spain and he could not expect to get more for the business than would support them all for a few years and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put forward the ridiculous argument that there was nothing more disgraceful in baking bread than in ploughing a barren field or pressing olives . Martin installed his family over the shop . He got up long before dawn to bake the bread and then rode out to the farm and worked there till dusk . He prospered , for his bread was good , and in a year or two was able to hire a man to take his place on the farm , but he never let a day pass without going to see his parents . He seldom came without bringing them something , and now they were able to eat meat every day that the Church allowed it . They were getting on in years and Don Juan could not deny that the presents his son brought were a comfort to his old age . Though there had been some surprise in the city when the son of Don Juan de Valero thus demeaned himself and the boys in the streets called after him mockingly Panadero , Panadero , which means Baker , Baker , his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently disarmed everyone . He was charitable and no poor person ever came to his door asking for alms without being sent away with a loaf of new bread . He was pious , went to Mass every Sunday , and confessed regularly four times a year . He was now a hale and hearty man , thirty-four years of age , somewhat corpulent , for he liked good food and good wine , with an open red face and a cheerful , happy look . " He 's a good fellow , " people said of ? 500 MAGAZINE him , " not very intelligent and not very cultured , but kind and honest . " It was fortunate that he had taken upon himself the charge of his parents , for Friar Blasco had never in the twenty years he had been away sent any money to help them for everything he had went in charity , while Don Manuel never sent them anything because it never occurred to him that anyone could make better use of his money than he could himself . They were thus in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and could not but regret that he had made such a miserable business of life . It was a constant irritation that he seemed quite content with it . They treated his plebeian wife with the stately courtesy which they felt their own self-respect demanded of them and grew fond of their grandchildren . But their fondest thoughts went to the two sons who had brought honor and glory to their ancient name . VII I T is not hard to imagine with what joy Don Juan and Dofia Violante looked forward to seeing them after a separation of so many years . The friar had written at rare intervals and since neither Don Juan nor his son the baker was handy with his pen and in any case would not have trusted himself to write with the elegance due to a learned ecclesiastic they had got Domingo Perez to answer his letters . This he had done with complete satisfaction both to them and to himself , for he took pride in the elegance of his style . Don Manuel , on the other hand , had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of Calatrava and was obliged to offer proof of his unsullied ancestry . Here again the good offices of Domingo were requisitioned and he prepared a genealogy , duly sworn to by the magistrates of the city , in which he traced the origins of the family , without a single admixture of Jewish blood , to Alphonso VIII , King of Castile , who married Eleanora , daughter of King Henry II of England . The two brothers had arranged to meet at a town some twenty miles from the city and make their solemn entry together . It was pleasing to Don Juan to think that the grandeur of the receptionarranged for them would in some measure counterbalance the long disgrace of poor Martin 's degradation . It was of course impossible for him to house his two sons and their suite in his tumbledown grange , and it was arranged that the Bishop should be lodged in the Dominican convent while the steward of the Duke of Castel Rodriguez , his master being absent in Madrid , offered Don Manuel an apartment in the ducal palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , the magistrates and the clergy on mules ; Don Juan and Doha Violante with Martin and his family followed in a carriage lent them by a person of rank ; and presently the anxiously expected visitors were seen making their way along the dusty , winding road . The Bishop in his Dominican habit , on a mule , rode side by side with his brother on a charger . Don Manuel wore a magnificent suit of armor inlaid with gold . After them came the Bishop 's two secretaries , members of his own order , his servants , and then the captains in sumptuous livery . After greeting the important personages who had come to meet them and listening to some eloquent speeches , the Bishop asked for his father and mother . They had been hanging back modestly , but now came forward . Dofia Violante was about to kneel and kiss the episcopal ring , but the Bishop , to the admiration of the onlookers , prevented her and taking her in his arms kissed her on both cheeks . She began to weep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their cheeks . He kissed his father and then , while the two old people turned to their second son , he asked for Martin . " El Panadero , " someone called . " The baker . " Martin then made his way through the crowd with his wife and children . They were all in their best clothes and the jolly , red-faced , corpulent man looked well enough . The Bishop greeted him affectionately , Don Manuel with a certain condescension , and Consuelo and the children knelt on the ground and kissed the Bishop 's ring . He graciously congratulated Martin on the number and healthy appearance of his offspring . The procession was formed and the cavalcade made an imposing entry into the city . As they passed through the gate all the church bells were set ringing , crackers were exploded , trumpeters blew their trumpets , and drummers beat their drums . The streets were crowded and there was a great shouting and a clapping of hands as they passed through on their way to the Collegiate Church where a Te Dem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was done the Bishop retired to be alone with his family . Dan Manuel , his eyes black with anger , addressed him at once . " Brother , " he said , " do you know that this Martin , son of a gentleman of ancient lineage , is a pastry cook ? " The Bishop merely smiled . " Not a pastry cook , brother . A baker . " " Do you mean to say that you knew ? " " I have known it for years . Though my sacred duties prevented me from taking the care of my parents that I wished to I have watched over them from afar and have constantly remembered them in my prayers . The prior of our order in this city has kept me informed of their condition . " " Then how could you let him bring such shame upon our family ? " " Our brother Martin is a virtuous and a pious man . He is a respected citizen and charitable to the poor . He has taken good care of our parents in their old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepwhich was forced upon him by circum-stances . " " I am a soldier , brother , and I put my honor before my life . This has ruined my plans . " " I very much doubt it . " " How do you know ? " blustered Don Manuel . " You do not know what my plans are . " The shadow of a smile lightened for an instant the Bishop 's austere features . " You can not be very worldly-wise , brother , " he replied , " if you are unaware that there is little of our personal affairs that remains hidden from our servants . You forget that we spent two days under the same roof on our way hither . You did not come here only to fulfil a filial duty , but also to choose a wife from among the nobility of the City . " Meanwhile Martin had listened without any sign that he was in the least ashamed . ? " Do not forget , Manuel , " he said now , " that Domingo Perez has traced our descent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That should assuredly carry weight with the family whom you are proposing to honor by taking their daughter to your wife . " " Who is this Domingo Perez ? " the soldier asked sulkily . " A man of learning and a poet . " " I remember him " said the Bishop . " We were at the seminary together . " Don Manuel tossed his head impatiently and turned to his father . " Why did you allow Martin to disgrace us ? " " I did not approve of it . I did everything in my power to prevent it. ? Don Manuel now turned sternly on his younger brother . " Give me one reason , only one , why , flinging decency to the winds , you demeaned yourself by becoming a baker . " " Hunger , " VIII D OMINGO PEREZ concluded his splendid account of the day and swallowed his last mouthful at the same moment , and immediately went upstairs to his room . After one swift glance at Catalina 's almost desperate face Maria followed him . His small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his clothes , a table , and a chair . There was a shelf filled with books and books were lying on the table , on the floor , on the chest . The table was littered with papers and there was ' a great pile of manuscripts in one corner of the room . She told him Catalina 's story , speaking urgently to keep his attention from wandering to the books , how the Blessed Virgin had appeared to her and told her that the Bishop , Don Juan 's son , had the power to cure her of her infirmity . " It was a dream , my poor Maria , " he said when she had finished . " That is what I told her . She declared that she was wide awake . I can not persuade her otherwise . " Domingo was disturbed . " I will come downstairs with you and she shall tell me the story herself . " For the second time and with even greater exactness , Catalina narrated the incident . Domingo had but to look at her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Satan has many wiles to beguile the unwary , " he said thoughtfully . " Could a demon assume the mildness and the loving kindness of Our Lady when she spoke to me ? " " The devil is a good actor , " smiled Domingo . " What have you done , dear heart , to deserve a favor that others are accorded only as the result of long years of self-immolation ? " " Nothing , " said Catalina . " But I am poor and unhappy , I prayed the Blessed Virgin to succor me , and she took pity on me , " " Our Holy Church does not regard with indulgence individuals who claim to have communications with Heaven . The country is infested with persons who declare that they have been granted supernatural privileges . Some are poor deluded creatures who honestly believe what they say ; many are impostors who make these pretensions either to gain notoriety or to make money . The Holy Office rightly concerns itself with them , for they cause disturbance among the ignorant and often lead them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itscourges , some it sends to the galleys , and others to the stake . I beseech you as you love us not to divulge a word of what you have told us . " " But , Uncle , dear Uncle , all my happiness is at stake . Everyone knows that there is no more saintly man in the kingdom than the Bishop , How can I remain silent when the Blessed Mother of God herself told me that he can cure me of the infirmity that has robbed me of the love of my Diego ? " " It is not only you that are concerned . If the Holy Office takes it upon itself to make an inquiry , it may well be that the case against me will be reopened , and if we are put into the prison of the Inquisition this house will be sold to pay for the cost of our maintenance and your mother will be thrown into the street to beg her bread . Promise me at least that you will say nothing till we have had time to reflect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anxiety in Domingo 's expression that Catalina yielded . " Yes , I will promise you that . " " You are a good girl . Now let your mother put you to bed , for we are all weary after the events of the day . " He kissed her and left the two women to themselves , but from the stairs he called his sister . She went out . " Give her a purge , " he whispered . " If she has a good movement of the bowels she will be more reasonable and we can persuade her tomorrow that the whole thing was no more than a very unfortunate dream . " IX N ow it happened that the next day was a Friday and Maria went to confession . After she had received absolution she told her confessor Catalina 's strange story and much of what Domingo had said . " Your brother has behaved with a discretion and good sense the more admirable because these qualities could hardly be expected in him , " said Father Vergara . " This is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in haste . There must be no scandal and you must order your daughter not to speak to anyone of this thing . I will reflect upon it and if needful consult my superior . " Father Vergara was a Dominican and it was in his convent that the Bishop and his suite were lodging . He was a simple man of no great learning and Maria 's story of her daughter 's adventure troubled him so much that he felt bound to report it to his prior . The prior after some thought came to the conclusion that the Bishop should be informed of it , so he sent a novice to ask if it would be convenient for him to see him and Father Vergara on a matter that might be of importance . In a little while the novice came back to say that the Bishop would be pleased to receive them . When the prior and Father Vergara entered they found the Bishop dictating letters to one of his secretaries . The prior explained their errand and then asked Father Vergara to repeat exactly what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to an end the Bishop 's face had assumed an expression of such severity that the friar , his voice faltering , sweated at every pore . Silence fell . " I know this Domingo , " said the Bishop at length . " He is a man of evil life but he is not a fool . When he exacted a promise of secrecy from his niece he acted with prudence . You would be well advised to refuse to give this child absolution until she promises that she will not speak of this affair to anybody . " The poor friar stared at the Bishop in confusion . Was he not by common consent a saint ? Father Vergara thought he would have welcomed the opportunity to exercise his miraculous powers and thereby not only glorify God , but bring many sinners to repentance . The Bishop 's eyes were cold . The two friars sidled away without another word . " Why is he vexed ? " asked Father Vergara . " We ought not to have spoken to him about it . 1 am to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how great a saint he is and does not look upon himself as worthy to perform a miracle . " This seemed a very reasonable explanation and since it only redounded to the Bishop 's credit Father Vergara made haste to tell his brother friars all about it . Soon the convent was buzzing with excitement . Some praised the Bishop 's modesty , others regretted that he had not taken occasion to do something that would so greatly add to his renown and to the credit of the order . Meanwhile , however , the story reached another quarter . The church in which Catalina had prayed and from which , if she was to be believed , the Blessed Virgin had come was attached , as has been mentioned , to the Carmelite Convent of the Incarnation . The convent was richly endowed and for a good many years the Lady Prioress had been in the habit of giving Maria Perez work to do . Maria had thus come to be on friendly terms with many of the nuns . Two or three days after Maria 's confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing her errand began to chat with the nun who was her most intimate friend . Swearing her to secrecy she told her of her daughter 's strange experience . The nuns were great gossips and such a story was bound to be an event in the pious but monotonous routine of their lives , so that within twenty-four hours every inmate of the convent heard it and eventually it reached the ears of the Lady Prioress. x B EATRIZ HENRIQUEZ Y BRAGANZA , in religion Beatriz de San Domingo , was the only daughter of the Duke of Castel Rodriguez , a grandee of Spain . He had great wealth and power and lived in a state that was almost royal . When Beatriz was thirteen he looked about for a suitable mate for her and finally settled upon the only son of the Duke of Casa-franca . The young people were betrothed. but since the boy was only fifteen no time for the marriage was set . After seeing him just long enough to know that she detested him thoroughly , Beatriz was sent to the Carmelite Convent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castel Rodriguez at sixteen she was gay , passionately fond of dancing , mischievous , and wilful . She was even then of an imperious temper for she realized that she was born to great station and that the world must submit to her caprice . She was well aware of her beauty and at High Mass with her mother missed none of the admiring glances that the young blades of the city cast on her . Though she never looked at them she knew them all by sight and it was not long before she found out their names , what families they belonged to , and in fact all there was to know about them . Because the Duchess was in ill health , Beatriz was often accompanied to the early mass by her duenna . Not many people attended at such an hour , but there was one young seminarist who never failed . He was tall and thin , with decided features and dark passionate eyes . Beatriz always saw him . " Who is that ? " she asked one day when she saw him slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the duenna . " Nobody . The eldest son of Juan Suarez de Valero . Gutter nobility . " Nownsic the devastating power of her splendid eyes , she thought it would be a merry prank to make the serious young seminarist conscious of ' her , and so she fixed him with her gaze , willing with all her might that he might look at her . For days she gazed in vain and then a day came when she had an intuition that he was uneasy . She waited , holding her breath ; he looked up suddenly , as though he had heard an unexpected sound , and catching her eye turned quickly away . From then on she ceased to throw him even a glance , but a day or two later , though her head was bent as though she were praying , she was conscious that he was staring at her . She remained quite still . She had the sensation that he was looking at her , bewildered , with a look that he had never given anyone before . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . He turned away as quickly as before and she saw his face suffused with a blush of shame . Two or three times in the street with her duenna she saw him coming toward them and though he passed with his headaverted she knew that he was shaken . Once , catching sight of them , he turned on his heel and walked back the way he had come . Then one morning it chanced that they entered the church just as he was dipping his fingers in the holy water . Beatriz put out her hand to touch his fingers and thus receive the holy water on her own . It was a common and natural action and he could not refuse . He went very white and once more their eyes met . It was only for an instant but in that instant Beatriz knew that he loved her with a human love , and at the same time she felt a sharp pain in her heart as though it were pierced by a sword and she knew that she loved him with the same human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had discovered before this that some errand or occupation took him every day past the Duke 's palace at a certain hour and she found means to sit at a window from which she could watch the street . She saw him coming , saw his steps linger even though his face was averted . Just as he passed beneath the window she let a carnation fall . Instinctively he glanced up , but she drew back . He stopped and picked up the flower . He held it in both hands as though it were a precious jewel . Then with a violent gesture he flung it to the ground , stamped it in the dust , and ran as fast as his legs would carry him . When he did not come to the early mass for several days running she could bear her anxiety no longer . " What has happened to that seminarist who used to serve Mass ? " she asked her duenna . " That one ? He has taken the vows and entered the Dominican order . " Beatriz fainted . For weeks thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father and mother with the announcement that she wished to enter religion . They did their utmost to dissuade her but eventually were convinced that her desire was too strong to resist , that her vocation was real . Whereupon the Duke decided for his own honor and the glory of God to found a convent at Castel Rodriguez to which his daughter would come as soon as she finished her novitiate and where in due course she would be prioress . At the time with which this narrative is concerned Dona Beatriz de San Domingo had been prioress for many years . She was a very busy woman . Besides her religious duties and the management of the convent she had to look after the vast properties with which the foundation had been endowed . She was between forty and fifty , a tall , gaunt , pale woman , with hardly a line in her face and great somber eyes . Age had refined her features so that she had the severe beauty of a knight 's lady on a Gothic tomb . She had a grim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often smiled it was with a sort of grave indulgence . Such then was the woman to whose ears it came that the Blessed Virgin had appeared to Catalina Perez on the steps of the Carmelite Church . XI D oRA Beatriz was not only a fine organizer and a good business woman , but also a highly intelligent and level-headed one . She had always discouraged visions , raptures , and special graces among her nuns . It was highly improbable that there was anything in Catalina 's queer story , but since the nuns were so excited about it that they could talk of nothing else , Dofia Beatriz thought it advisable to send for the young woman and get it from her own lips . She called one of her nuns and told her to fetch the girl . In a little while the nun came back and informed her that Catalina was dutifully prepared to obey the Reverend Mother 's order , but her confessor had forbidden her to repeat her story to anyone . Dona Beatriz , unused to being crossed , frowned and when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here , Your Reverence , " said the nun , catching her breath . " The confessor did not forbid her to speak . " A grim smile appeared on the Prioress 's pallid lips . " I will see the woman . " Maria Perez was ushered into the oratory . She had often seen the Prioress , but had never spoken to her , and she was flustered . Dona Beatriz sat in a high chair , with a leather seat and a leather back the top of which was decorated with acanthus leaves in gilt wood . Maria Perez could not imagine that a queen could look more remote , dignified , and proud . She knelt and kissed the thin white hand that was offered her . Then , bidden to tell what she had come to say , she repeated word for word what Catalina had told her . When she had finished the Prioress gave a slight inclination of her distinguished head . " You may go . " F OR some time she pondered . Then she sat down at the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Segovia to do her the honor of coming to see her , since she wished to speak to him on a matter that seemed to have some importance . She sent the letter and within an hour received a reply . The Bishop said that he would be pleased to visit the convent on the following day . The nuns were in a turmoil when they learned that this eminent and saintly person was expected , and they instantly jumped to the right conclusion that his visit had to do with the miraculous appearance of the Blessed Virgin on the steps of their own beautiful church . He came in the afternoon , alone , and was led at once to the Prioress . Dona Beatriz rose to meet him and falling to her knees kissed the episcopal ring , then she motioned him to a chair and sat down . " I was hoping your lordship would see fit to visit this convent , " she said , " but since you did not come I ventured to invite you . " " My teacher of theology at Salamanca told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , to be polite to them , but to keep them at a distance . " She did not utter the tart reply that was at the tip of her tongue , but instead looked at him intently . He cast his eyes down and waited . She was in no hurry to speak . It was nearly thirty years since she had last seen him and these were the first words they had ever exchanged . His habit was old and patched . His head was shaven except for the ring of black hair , only just touched with gray , that represented the Crown of Thorns . His temples were hollow , his cheeks sunken , his face , deeply lined , bore the mark of suffering ; only the eyes , luminous with a strange light , darkly passionate , remained to remind her of the young seminarist she had known so long ago  --  known and loved so madly . All that passion , the passion that in her foolish youth she imagined would endure to the end , was long since dead . Time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multifarious duties of her position , had gradually dulled it till it was now no more than a bitter recollection . As she looked at the man now , so worn , haggard , with that look of suffering on his face , she wondered if he remembered that once he had loved against his will , yes , but with all his heart , a beautiful girl whom he had never even spoken to , but who tormented his dreams . The silence weighed upon the Bishop and he moved uneasily in his chair . y OUR Reverence said that she had a matter of importance on which she wished to consult me , " he said . " Yes , but first permit me to offer your lordship my felicitations on the dignity to which it has pleased His Majesty to advance you . " " I can only hope that I shall prove worthy to perform the duties of so great an office . " " The fame of your lordship 's austerity , virtue , and unremitting diligence in defense of the purity of our faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for a moment from under beetling brows . " Madam , I am obliged to you for your courtesy , but I must beg you to spare me your compliments . It has never been to my liking that people should talk of me to my face . I shall be grateful if you will tell me without further delay for what reason you requested me to visit you . " The Prioress was not at all abashed by this reproof . A bishop he might be , but as her duenna , now with God , had once said , hidalgo de gutierra , a gutter nobleman ; and she was the daughter of the Duke of Castel Rodriguez . A word from her to her brother , confidant of King Philip the Third 's favorite , would relegate this prelate to an obscure bishopric in the Canaries . " I am sorry to offend your lordship 's modesty , " she answered coolly , " but it is your virtue and your austerity , your sanctity , if I may say so , which are the immediate occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you been informed of the strange experience of a girl called Catalina Perez ? " " I have . Her confessor , doubtless a worthy man , but neither learned nor intelligent , reported her story to me . I dismissed him . I have forbidden the friars in the convent to mention it to me or to talk about it among themselves . The girl is either an impostor , looking for notoriety , or a deluded fool . " " She is truthful and , I am told , far from fanciful . " " If she had such a vision as she describes it can only be a machination of Satan . It is well known that demons have the power of disguising themselves in celestial forms in order to tempt the unwary . " " How the devil could he be so stupid as to think her soul would be endangered by having a saintly man lay his hand on her in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost ? " " Madam , Lucifer , son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be but through pride that I , a very wicked and a very sinful man , should take it upon myself to work miracles ? " " It may be fitting that in your humility you should regard yourself as a sinful and wicked man , my lord , but the rest of the world is well aware of your great virtue . Everyone is excited and expectant . In some way satisfaction must be given to the people . " The Bishop sighed . " I know the people are disturbed . " " Would n't it be well if you saw the girl ? With the skill you acquired in the Holy Office in the examination of suspects , you should be able to tell very quickly if she is an impostor . " For a long time the Bishop was sunk in thought , torn by indecision . At last he sighed again . " Where can I see this girl ? " " Can there be a better place than in this chapel dedicated to the worship of the Blessed Virgin ? " " Let her come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He rose from his seat and as he bowed to take his leave of the Prioress she knelt down once more and kissed his ring . XII N EXT day , at the appointed hour , the Bishop , accompanied by his two secretaries , entered the richly decorated church . Catalina , with one of the nuns , was waiting in the Lady Chapel . " You may leave us , " he said to the nun , and then when she had gone he signaled to the two friars to go also . They silently slid away . The Bishop took a long look at the crippled girl . He had a tender heart and was always moved by distress , want or infirmity . She was trembling a little and she was very pale . " Do not be frightened , child , " he said gently . " You have nothing to fear if you tell the truth . " She looked very simple and very innocent . He saw that she had a singularly beautiful face , but he noticed it as indifferently as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her voice was soft and melodious as she told him the simple little story of her life . " How is it you have learned to speak so sensibly and so well , my daughter ? " he asked gently . " My Uncle Domingo Perez taught me to read and write . He took great pains with me . He has been like a father to me . " " I knew him once . " Catalina was well aware of her uncle 's bad reputation and she was afraid that her reference to him would do her little good in the eyes of that saintly man . There was a silence and for a moment she feared he was going to end the interview . " Now tell me in your own words the story you told your mother , " he said , fixing her with searching eyes . She repeated everything exactly as she had told it to her mother , making clear her conviction that his lordship now had the power to cure her . She finished and there was a long silence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her innocence , her sincerity were unmistakable . It could not have been a dream . Others had had their prayers answered , others had received spiritual grace , others had been cured of their ills . If he refused to do what it seemed as if he had been bidden to do , because he was afraid , might he not be committing a grave sin of omission ? " A sign , " he muttered to himself . " A sign . " H E TOOK a step or two forward till he came to the altar above which in a great cloak of blue velvet , all stitched in gold , with a golden crown on her head , stood an image of the Mother of God . He knelt and prayed passionately for guidance . At last , with a sad sigh , he rose to his feet and stood , his arms outstretched in supplication . Suddenly Catalina gave a little startled cry . The two friars had withdrawn out of sight , but when they heard this they scuttled forth quickly and what they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bishop of Segovia , was slowly rising into the air , rising with an even , almost imperceptible motion ; the Bishop rose till he was face to face with the image over the altar and for a moment was suspended in the air for all the world like a falcon motionless on its outstretched wings . One of the friars , fearing he would fall , made as if to start forward , but the other , Father Antonio , restrained him ; and the Bishop , slowly , slowly , so that you were barely conscious of movement , descended till his feet once more touched the marble floor in front of the altar . His arms fell to his sides and he turned round . The two friars ran up and failing on their knees kissed the hem of his habit . He seemed not to be aware of their presence . He walked down the three steps that led from the altar and like a man in a daze groped his way out of the chapel . The two friars , in case he stumbled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged from the church . The Bishop paused at the top of the steps , the steps on which Catalina had sat when Our Lady appeared to her , and looked at the little plaza dazzling in the light of the August sun . The unclouded sky was so blue , so bright after the incense-laden dimness of the church , that to look at it was blinding . The white houses , shuttered against the heat , seemed to sparkle with a gem-like brilliance of their own . The Bishop shuddered although the day had the heat of a furnace . He came to himself . " Have the girt told that she shall hear from me . " He descended the steps and the friars followed him at a respectful distance . When they arrived at the Dominican convent he stopped and turned to them . " Under pain of excommunication you will not utter a single word of what you have seen today . " " It was a miracle , Senor , " said Father Antonio , " Is it fair that such a signal mark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When you made your profession , my son , you took the vow of obedience . " XIII UT it had not occurred to him to bind Catalina to secrecy and she hurried home as fast as her crutch would allow . In awestruck tones she told her mother the wonder of which she had been a witness , and when she had finished told it all over again . Maria Perez waited for the recreation hour at the convent when she knew that most of the nuns would be assembled talking with the lady boarders and visitors from the city and then she appeared there and related the amazing occurrence . She had quite an audience when she told her story and the subprioress was so much impressed with it that she felt not a moment should be lost telling it to Doiia Beatriz . In a little while Maria Perez was summoned to the presence . She repeated her narrative . The Prioress listened with a satisfaction she saw no reason to conceal , " After this there can be no hesitation , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this convent , but to the Order of Our Lady of Carmel . " She dismissed the two women and taking up her quill wrote a letter to the Bishop in which she told him that she had learned of the grace that had been accorded him that morning . No further proof was needed that what the girl Catalina Perez had said was true ; and he must now put aside his doubts and uncertainties , for nothing could be plainer than that it was his Christian duty to accept the charge laid upon him . She requested , with great humility , that he should deign to perform the miracle in the church in which he had been granted this divine favor and for which it was evident the Blessed Virgin had conceived a particular affection . She sent the letter by messenger . I N A couple of hours the whole city knew about the levitation of the Bishop . More gentlemen came to the Dominican convent in order to get information at first hand . The friars were in a tremor of religious enthusiasm . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him of the general excitement . The Prioress 's letter was open on a table . The Bishop pointed to it . " These wretched women , they can not hold their tongues , " he said . " It is a great humiliation to me that this thing should have become known . " " Our brothers of this convent hope that your lordship will now consent to cure the unhappy girl of her infirmity . " Other visitors came , and in the end the Bishop allowed himself to be convinced that it was the will of God that he should do what the Blessed Virgin required of him . He made certain con-ditions , however . He insisted on secrecy . He would go to the Carmelite church and say his Mass there on the following morning . The doors must be closed so that no one should be admitted . He would himself be accompanied only by his secretaries . The Bishop then sent Father Antonio to inform Dona Beatriz of his decision . He gave her permission to bring her nuns , but forbade the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catalina prepare herself to partake of Holy Communion after Mass and requested her and her nuns to pray for him that night . Within an hour an excited nun came to Maria Perez and asked to see Catalina since she had something very private and important to tell her . When Catalina was called the nun put her finger to her lips to emphasize the silence that was required . " It 's a great secret , " she said . " You must n't tell anyone . His lordship is going to cure you and tomorrow you 'll be running about on your two feet like any other Christian . " Catalina gasped and her heart began to beat like mad . " Tomorrow ? " " You 're to take Holy Communion and so you must n't eat anything after midnight . You know that . " " Yes , I know that . But I never do eat anything after midnight . " " And you must put yourself in a state of grace . After you 've received Communion he 'll make you whole just like our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama and Uncle Domingo come ? " " Nothing was said about them . Surely they can come . It may well turn your poor uncle from his evil ways . " D OMINGO did not get back from the country till late that evening , but he was no sooner in the house than Catalina in a tremor of agitation told him her thrilling news . He stared at her with consternation . " Are n't you glad , Uncle ? " she cried . He did not speak . He began pacing the room . Catalina could not understand his strange behavior . " What 's the matter with you , Uncle ? Are n't you pleased ? I thought you 'd be as happy as I am . Do n't you want me to be cured ? " He shrugged his shoulders irritably and went on pacing the room . Suddenly he stopped and faced Catalina , looking at her with a sternness she had never seen in him before . " Tell me exactly what it was that the Blessed Virgin said to you . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' The son of Don Juan de Valero who has best served God has it in his power to cure you . ' " Domingo interrupted her harshly . " But that is not what you told your mother . You told her that Blasco de Valero had it in his power to cure you . " " It 's the same thing , The Bishop is a saint , all the world knows that . Which of the sons of Don Juan has served God so well ? " " You fool , " he shouted . " You little fool . " " It 's you who are the fool , " she answered hotly . " You never believed that the Blessed Virgin had appeared to me and spoken to me and then had vanished from my sight . You thought it was a dream . Well , listen to this . " She told him then how she had seen the Bishop rise from the floor and stay suspended in the air and then sink down once more to the floor . " That was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it with their own eyes . " " Stranger things have happened , " he muttered . " And yet you refuse to believe that Our Blessed Lady appeared to me . " He looked at her now with a twinkle in his eyes . " I do n't . I did n't believe it before , but I believe it now , not for what you saw this morning , but for the words the Blessed Virgin spoke to you . There is a meaning in them that convinces me " And suddenly he laughed with a great roar . Catalina was perplexed . She could not understand how the insignificant difference in the two versions could make any odds . He gently patted her cheek . " I am a great sinner , my poor child , and what makes my situation desperate is that I have never yet succeeded in repenting of my sins . I have lived a hazardous and a worthless life , but I have read many books , ancient and modern . Be of good heart , my dear , perhaps all may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where are you going , Uncle ? " He left without giving her an answer and hurried to the Dominican convent . Though it was still light , the hour was advanced and the porter would not admit him . Domingo insisted that he must see the Bishop on a matter of grave importance , but the porter would not even open the door . Domingo begged him at least to fetch one of his lordship 's secretaries and at last Father Antonio came to the door . Domingo besought him to let him see the Bishop , since he had a vital communication to impart to him . The friar had evidently been informed of Domingo 's reputation for he answered coldly . He said it was impossible to disturb his lordship , for he was spending the night in prayer and had given orders that he was on no account to be disturbed . " If you do not let me see him you will be responsible for a terrible mishap . " . " Drunkard , " said Father Antonio scornfully . " A drunkard I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bitterly regret it if you will not let me in . " " What is this message that you wish me to deliver ? " Domingo hesitated . He was at his wit 's end . " Tell him that for the love he bears him Domingo Perez sends him this message : The stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner . " " Hijo de puts , " cried Father Antonio in a rage that this dissolute scamp should quote scripture . He slammed to the shutter of the judas . Domingo turned away .
