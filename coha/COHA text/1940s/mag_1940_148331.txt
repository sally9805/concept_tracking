( See Cover ) <P> " There are no boll weevils in the tourist crop , " the sages say in Florida . Last week Florida was harvesting its biggest crop of tourists . In limousines and trailers , by airline and boat and railway ( at lowest fares ever ) , they spread through all the long reach from Jacksonville on the north to Key West in the south ( see map ) . They went to fish for sail , marlin , tarpon on both coasts ; to peer at fish on display at Marineland and Silver Springs ; to watch their favorite ballplayers at Orlando , Clearwater , Sarasota ; to hear the Bok Carillon at Lake Wales ; to see Seminoles and alligators and flamingos and orange trees ; to have fun . <P> They settled at St. Petersburg ( up 15% over 1938-39 ) ; at snooty Palm Beach and plebeian West Palm Beach ( up 20% ) ; at Fort Lauderdale , " fastest growing city in the fastest growing county in Florida , " ( up 20% ) ; at Daytona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 20% ) . And by uncounted thousands they were diffused in trailer camps , autocamps , hamlets , roadside inns . By April 1 , when the winter season wanes and the smaller summer crop begins to bud . the calculators figure that upwards of 3,000,000 will have come and departed , left $365,000,000 in Florida pockets. * <P> The place to see the tourist crop at its verdant best and worst was along a patch of the Atlantic coastline , 350 miles down from the Georgia border , 145 miles up from the southernmost Florida Key . There lies the " Miami area . " <P> Seen from the air , this go-square mi. patch looks like one sprawling bailiwick , set in the flat expanses of citrus groves , bean and pepper and tomato fields that extend southward to the swampy Everglades . Actually it is divided into three parts .

S. phenomenon . <P> In Mayor Sewell 's thriving city of Miami last week : <P> &gt; Slack-chinned , dull-eyed Crackers from the back country thronged the narrow streets , along with vacationers in shorts and halters , blue-red-yellow slacks , astrologers , hackies , pimps , and the solid , trading , homeliving folk of the city . <P> &gt; The News ( which at the height of the Florida Boom led all U. S. newspapers in advertising lineage ) headlined G-Man John Edgar Hoover , ineffectively sounding off against the local toleration of gamblers , gangsters , brothels ; and Governor Fred Cone in Tallahassee , effectively commanding Miami politicos to close down the gaming . <P> &gt; At Hialeah , three dog-tracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling area , betters on a single " poor Monday " last week wagered $800,000 ; since the winter season opened had poured in a record $25,000,000 ( including the takes at both Hialeah and Tropical Park horsetracks ) .
