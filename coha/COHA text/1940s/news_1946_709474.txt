txt Anderson Asks Food Saving Under ' 47 Wheat Program Proposes Exporting Fourth of Billion-Bushel Crop , Halving Amount Fed Livestock , and Allowing None for Brewing By BESS PURINLA.N S7c ? CiP. / to Tli7 NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON . May 14 ? A 1946-47 wheat program issued today by Secretary of Agriculture Clinton Anderson called for continued food-conservation measures throughout the coming year . The Secretary based a ninepoint proposed plan of action on Herbert Hoover 's report , which , he said , showed clearly that there would be " great need for contin-I ued heavy shipments of United States wheat during July and August . " " By September , when these shipments are made and we see how world crops are coming in , we shall know a lot more about the whole situation , " Mr. Anderson added . Under the program the 1946 crop , estimated at about 1,000 , - 000,000 bushels , which with a small carry-over will make less wheat available next year than this , would be apportioned about as follows : 250,000,000 bushels for export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports this year . " 150,000,000 bushels for feeding livestock , or " roughly half of the total fed in each of the last two years . " 450,000,000 bushels for human food , about 5,000,000 less than this year . 2,000,000 bushels for industrial uses , none for brewing and distilling , as compared with 20,000,000 used industrially this , year and 82,000,000 in the preceding year . The rest would go for seed and carry-over . Increases in grain prices were announced last week to bring about a better ratio between livestock feeding and food for human consumption . The 1946-47 program , presumably to be formally ordered about July 1 , contemplates these things : Continuing the 80 per cent // wheat-extraction provision , making for darker bread . Limiting the amount of wheat used in the manufacture of flour for domestic use to the quantity required to produce 85 per cent as much flour as was distributed for domestic use in the corresponding month of 1945 . Curbs Storing of Wheat . Providing that at least one-half ' of all wheat delivered to an elevator by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of all of it being held in storage for the producer ; also providing that I one-half of all wheat purchased by elevators and merchandisers must be set aside for sale to the Commodity Credit Corporation until the Government gets its 250,000 , - 000 bushels for export . Asking the Office of Defense Transportation , so as to conserve transportation , to prohibit the shipment of wheat out of Oklahoma , Texas , New Mexico , Arkansas and Louisiana , except for export or by special permit . Early wheat from this area might otherwise be drawn off into other areas of the country , only to have to be replaced later by shipments back from these other areas . Placing further limitations on use of wheat by feed manufacturers as soon as the general feed situation improves sufficiently . Continuing orders which prohibit use of wheat and wheat products for manufacture of beer and alcohol . . Continuing the voluntary conservation program , including reduction in the weight of bread loaves and rolls . Wheat inventory provisions will not be made applicable to the 1946 crop unless inequitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent crisis were first reduced to forty-five days , then to thirty and currently are only twenty-one . Davis Praises the Program Chester Davis , chairman of the Famine Emergency Committee , praised Secretary Anderson 's new program at a press conference following a meeting of the committee today by saying , " It certainly is forehanded management of the 1946 crop . " Both that reply , and a flat statement , " Right today we are getting the wheat , " were made in refutation to questions as to whether the program to feed Europe thus far had been a failure . Chester Bowles , Stablization Director , said at his press conference today that the food situation was not tight enough yet to compel rationing , but might become so . " I do n't ? see rationing as a means of cutting down , but as a result of cutting down , " he declared . His point was that when shipments overseas were assured by set-asides , as was done during the war , rationing was the device for equitably distributing the supplies left for domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about food shipments , warning , " we are going to fall scandalously behind in our , commitments if we do n't . " Mr. Bowles said he would know more about rationing in the next thirty to sixty days . He mentioned meat , butter , cheese and possibly bread as foods that might have to be rationed . As a result of the Hoover trip abroad , the Famine Emergency Committee today issued a separate report on the hunger of Europe 's children , prepared by Maurice Pate , a member of the party . On the basis of statistics and personal visits to schools , orphanages , and homes in all the countries visited , Mr. Pate said that Mr. Hoover 's first estimate of more than 2,000,000 of Europe 's 40,000,000 children seriously underfed " veers to the low side . " He ? praised the English and Scandinavian systems of child feeding , and described the heightweight-age ratio of Polish children as the worst . Of Poland 's 7,000 , - 000 children , Mr. Pate said , about 1,100,000 were orphans or halforphans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent were wards of relatives , and 25 per cent had to have care .
