In Manhattan last week , a check for $143,027,000 was handed to Robert M. Littlejohn , War Assets Administrator . It was the final payment on the most favorable war-surplus deal the Government had ever made , and it closed the books on the long , acrimonious controversy over disposal of the Big Inch pipelines . <P> In return for the check , Reginald H. Hargrove , * president of the Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. , got title to the 1,254-mile , 24-in . Big Inch , and the longer ( 1,479-mile ) but smaller ( 20-in . ) Little Big Inch . Through them , Texas Eastern soon hopes to be pumping 433 million cubic feet of natural gas a day from Texas to the fuel-pinched Northeast . <P> The nimble way in which upstart Texas Eastern had jumped overnight into the first rank of U.S. public utilities impressed Wall Streeters . But what really made their eyes pop was the way Manhattan 's Dillon , Read &; Co .

Holley Poe , an Oklahoma-born gas consultant ; Everette Lee De Golyer , Texas ' famed oil geologist ; Charles I. Francis , a Houston lawyer , and Houston 's shipyard-building brothers , George and Herman Brown ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) . They advanced some $250,000 ( later repaid by the company ) in the early stages of engineering , planning and bidding .

Thus the founders already had a $9,825,000 paper profit on their $150,000 investment in Texas Eastern stock . The Brown brothers had made $2,800,000 in paper profits on their initial investment for stock of $42,750 .
