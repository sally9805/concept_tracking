Notes of pessimism from Festung Europa : <P> &gt; Said Brsseler Zeitung : " It would be madness to say that the situation has not grown worse during the past month . The Italians always say openly how bad the situation is , and the Germans must say so too . All conditions which favored the Axis before now favor the Allies . Never before has Germany been in greater danger . " <P> Gauleiter Hoffman of hard-hit Westphalia took the stand last week to counteract rumors of destruction and death circulating in the Ruhr . Said he : " It is claimed , for instance , that Hans Fritsche official radio commentator said in a broadcast that 10% of the armament industry has been destroyed in a raid on Dortmund . Fritsche said no such thing . This also applies to the catastrophe of the Mhne Dam . Twenty and 40 thousand were mentioned as the number of fatal casualties . The true figures were published . ... It is a deplorable fact . . . but we can admit it quite frankly . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pessimism and opposition among the German people might seem strange and indicative of trickery . But the fact was that German propagandists , like German militarists , were setting up their last and toughest line of defense . For the all-out battle which they expected , nothing less than the truth could serve as a weapon-for the German people had learned the truth at Stalingrad and in Tunisia .
