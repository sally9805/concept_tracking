The largest U.S. producer of wallboard and similar wood products last week took over one of its biggest customers . In return for 81,250 shares of its own stock ( current value : around $4,550,000 ) Masonite Corp . bought control of Marsh Wall Products , Inc. of Dover , Ohio , No. 1 finisher of Masonite wallboard . For 23-year-old Masonite , the deal will enable it to turn out finished products ( doors , panels , etc. ) for sale to the building trade . For Marsh Wall , it marked a new chapter in a happy saga of family enterprise . <P> Around the Table . The heroine is a chipper , bright-blue-eyed great-grandmother ( five times over ) named Mrs. Catherine Marsh , born 88 years ago this Christmas Day . When her husband , a traveling electrical engineer , was killed by a Coney Island subway train in 1905 , Mrs. Marsh was left with seven sons and two daughters ( the oldest son at home was 16 ) , no insurance and a $4,500 mortgage on the Ohio farm where they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Philadelphia . There Mrs. Marsh kept the family together by iron determination and a switch that was put to stinging use whenever any of the boys broke her cardinal rule : " Do n't fight among yourselves . You must depend on each other . " By mowing lawns , selling papers , and other odd jobs , and paying heed to " Mother , " the Marshes made ends meet . In six years Mother Marsh bought a white frame house . <P> Two years later , Alvin , her third son , had a chance to buy a back-alley lumberyard in the neighboring town of Dover , but he could find no one to lend him the money . At the first of many similar family councils around the dining room table , Mother Marsh talked things over with the whole brood , finally decided to mortgage the house to back Alvin . Starting with $1,700 , Alvin soon made enough to move out of the alley , set up two branches in other cities . <P> Within a few years he had added two brick companies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin took his brothers in as partners , made Mother a sort of chairman of the board . She ran things anyway . When serious disagreements cropped up , Mother Marsh , said one son , would " give us hell and make it hurt as much as one of the lickings we used to get . " <P> Around the Tree . Marsh Wall Products , Inc. , the fourth and largest of the family 's companies , was started in 1930 , almost ended when a fire razed its plant and equipment in 1935 . Starting up again from scratch , the brothers now have a business that employs more than 300 , grossed $6,000,000 this year . They sold their 80% interest in it ( Marsh friends and dealers and Masonite officials own the rest ) in line with the trend among family enterprises to consolidate with bigger corporations , thus make assets more liquid to pay such things as inheritance taxes . <P> Otherwise , the sale will not change things much for the Marshes ; they will still run the company . For Mother Marsh things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same white frame house in New Philadelphia . On Christmas Eve this year , she will do what she has always done for her grown-up brood : make them a batch of fudge , serve it around the tree , then lead a chorus of Silent Night before sending them off to bed .
