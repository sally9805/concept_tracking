" It 's your move , Mr. President . " So spoke Joe Ball , ablest young Republican internationalist , Senator from Minnesota , the Bi of the B2H2 group in the Senate. * <P> Looking squarely at the White House , and speaking squarely about foreign policy , Senator Ball bluntly demanded in the Saturday Evening Post : " Let the Congress know what is going on " - or this peace will be botched . <P> The President also heard , and at close range , from an even more potent voice : the Federal Council of Churches . Long ago the Federal Council had laid down its own basic propositions ( " Six Pillars " ) for a " just and durable peace . " Now , this late in the war , churchmen had grave doubts whether such a peace was in prospect . These doubts were solemnly stated to the President last week by : the ranking Episcopal bishop , Henry St. George Tucker ; a prominent Methodist , Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam ; and John Foster Dulles , international lawyer . After 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged , said only that he was " sympathetic . " <P> And from still another source came a big hint that it was high time the President revealed more of what has been decided . Old ( 78 ) Arthur Capper , Senator from Kansas since 1918 , is famed as the original Congressman who could keep both ears on the ground at once . Always a litmus-paper test of public opinion , Senator Capper now said , in a tone of irritation rare with him : " Let us have some more information - truth if you want to call it that about what was agreed on at Moscow and Teheran . " <P> <P> *Senators Ball , Burton , Hatch and Hill were so dubbed , to give a short name to their Senate resolution that the U.S. participate in an international organization .
