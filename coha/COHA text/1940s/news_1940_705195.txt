He took the " fictitious " name of " David Arden , " Dr. Grebanier declared , explaining that every Communist on the campus used aliases as a protection to the members of the party . " By the way , Professor , were there any other units at Brooklyn College ? " Mr. Windels asked . " Yes , I would say there were about two or three othe:s , " was the reply . Questioning on this point disclosed that Dr. Grebanier did not know the names of members outside his own unit . " Would you mind naming those in your unit ? " he was asked . " Mr. Windels , I think you ought not to ask me such a question , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the reply ; " this is a public inquiry and this information is pertinent . " Those Listed as Reds The names and aliases of eight faculty members , five or whom are still on the campus , were then given by the witness as members of the Communist party . Their names and aliases were listed as follows : Dr. Selsam , known as " Hill " and " Paul Salter . " Henry L. Klein , former fellow and tutor in the History Department , party name of " Lawrence .

" Weekly meetings took place at the homes ' 3f the party members , Dr. Grebanier testified . He said he lasted as chairman of the unit for just two weeks . Questions about the principles of Marxism and Leninism were discussed at the unit meetings , Dr. Grebanier declared . The " party line " was decided upon on questions of how to vote at faculty elections or campus events . Educational policies were sometimes discussed , he added . Every one was addressed as " Comrade , " he said . " But it is wrong to picture any deep-dyed plotting involved in these discussions , ' ' he added . Denying the accusations , seven present or former faculty members assailed Dr. Grenanier 's testimony as untrue . Professor Selsam declared // AT OPENING OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM INQUIRY Nine on Brooklyn College Faculty Listed As Reds by Professor , Including Himself // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Grebanier has for several years been demonstrating to his colleagues that he is increasingly unreliable in his judgment . His performance today proves this . " From Mrs. Selsam came the retort : " I am not a member of the Communist party . " Professor Ewen asserted that Di ' . Grebanier " is not telling the truth . " " Mr. Grebanier 's reasons for connecting me with the Communist party , " he said , " and attempting to discredit me professionally may not be unconnected with the joint composition of a book on English literature we had once planned , and whose original plan Mr. Grebanier eventually appropriated . He has sufficiently discredited himself at Brooklyn College already as an irresponsible and hysterical person . " " I deny absolutely that I am now or ever have been a member of the Communist party , " Mr. Young declared . " Dr. Grebanier 's irresponsibility is typical of a man who , having been educated in the New York public school system , allows himself to be used to destroy that system . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a Communist was a " downright lie . " " His statement indicates , " Mr. Klein said , " the extent to which the emotionally disturbed individual will falsify in order to gain some temporary notoriety for himself . " Professor Slochower said the charge was false and added that he could understand it only as a result of Dr. Grebanier 's " well-known tendency to fly eff half-cocked his irresponsible hatred for Teachers Union and its program and his attempts to strike out blindly in an effort to injure it and any one prominently connected with its policies . " Mr. Ogur said the statement was " an unmitigated falsehood . ' He declared that " only a person who at one time publicly denied his membership in that party as Dr Grebanier did only six months ago and who now swears he was a member of the Communist party could utter such a total lie . " Teachers Union Lawyer Ousted A few minutes after the hearing opened a flurry of excitement nearly upset the decorum of the committee , meeting in a small room at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bitter oral battle with " William G. Mulligan , attorney for the Teachers Union , on the question of procedure . The upshot was that Mr. Mulligan was forcibly ejected , shouting , by three policemen and a detective . For several months the committee , formed last Spring by the Legislature , has been conducting private hearings , gathering material on subversive activities in the local schools and colleges . The public sessions had been awaited with keen interest . Nearly 500 teachers and parents clamored to get into the hearing room , but all except about 100 were turned away . When the hearing adjourned at 4:30 P. M. , to be resumed at 10:30 o'clock this morning , scores were still standing in line . When the trial opened , Senator Coudert , who was seated between Senator John J. Dunnigan and Assemblyman Herbert A. Rapp , laid down two rules that , he said , would be followed throughout this series of public hearings . First , counsel for witnesses and third parties were not to be permitted to participate in the proceedings ; second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of counsel for the committee . Other persons desiring to testify or make statements must make written requests for that opportunity , which would be acted upon by the committee in executive session , Senator Coudert said . It was these rules that Mr. Mulligan denounced , causing his ejection . After being ejected , Mr. Mulligan issued a statement in which he declared that the hearing was not " fair and impartial . " He said it was nothing more than a one-sided attempt by the committee to present only one side of the evidence , " leaving the union no opportunity to correct false statements and present pertinent evidence . " Windels Explains Aims In his opening statement Mr. Windels declared that the bulk of the evidence obtained thus far relates to communistic activity in the schools . Mr. Windels pointed out " self-imposed limitations " that he felt he should assume " out of respect for professional standards and for the Legislature of this State . " " They may be expressed quite simply : To proceed with complete objectivity for one purpose only ? and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ; to investigate diligently and to present only such evidence as may be relevant by legal standards , and , above all , to refrain scrupulously from presenting gossip , rumor or hearsay , and to present only such evidence as would be accepted in a court of law ; to refrain from entering into public controversy with persons under inquiry , regardless of provocation ; to refrain from making charges in the public press ; in short , to adhere strictly to the ascertainment of facts and their orderly presentation . " It has always been the American method to respect the right of every man and woman in our democracy to his or her own political beliefs ; to organize political parties with a right to a place on the ballot ; to advocate changes in our social order or form of government , provided they do so openly and in accordance with the laws of the land and the principles of public trust or confidence in so doing . " Our country is not endangered either by freedom of opinion or freedom of speech , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abhorrent to the vast majority of our people . On the contrary , we have learned , through long experience , that there is real danger in attempts to suppress or to forbid its free expression , " Full recognition , however , of the right to private political beliefs does not mean that the public can have no legitimate interest in improper methods of political action . Therefore , there are now in our Federal and State laws , expressing our settled public policy , definite limitations in this respect on the conduct of individuals . "
