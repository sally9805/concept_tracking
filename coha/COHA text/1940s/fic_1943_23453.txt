HOW 'RE THINGS AT HOME ? A Stogy CHRISTOPHER LA FARCE This is the third story in Mr. La Farge ' s series , " East by Southwest . " Timfirst two oftpeared last month . ? The Editors I T WAS dreadfully hot when we were finally shut into the plane al Val des Naoulis , which is at the northern end of the island of Balade . It had rained hard that morning , and the red volcanic soil had turned to deep mud that was very adhesive and stained your khaki with its iron . Then the sun came out and fell on you as a substance , and it heated that Douglas two-motored transport into a Turkish bath . There were two huge airplane motors inside , covered with thick grease , and so the six of us passengers perched where we could to avoid the engines , and inevitably we spread the red mud on every spot that had been missed by the loading crew . " It 'll be cooler when we get going , " said the pilot , making his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the windows . That 'll help . " Then he disappeared into his flight cabin and shut the door . We pulled out the round rubber stoppers , of a size to let a gun through , but it made no difference . We sat and dripped . We did n't talk , it was too hot . There were four of us who had flown in the day before , coming from home . The other two had just arrived from the island theycall by the code name of " Zipper , " where the real trouble starts . Both were Marines , a private and a sergeant . Tf you 'd looked at the lot of us casually you 'd have had difficulty in spotting the veterans from the newcomers  --  we were all so dirty . You 'd have had to look carefully at our faces to notice how fresh the four of us looked and how deep were the lines of fatigue in the faces of the two Marines . Even when the pilot tested the engines and the propellers moved the air through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hot and humid . We got no relief till finally we were off the ground and had climbed to about four thousand feet . Then the air got cool and it dried our sweat , and we felt as though we could breathe again . We peered uncomfortably out of the little windows , watching the coast line that we followed . It was a fine country , from the air . Over to the east were high mountains of red rock that rose to a jagged skyline , covered with a heavy green vegetation all the way to their summits . Below the mountains lay a narrow coastal plain , rolling down in waves of gray-green grass to the shore below us . To the west was the sea , calm and brilliant inside its barrier reef , lying three or four miles out and roughly parallel to the shoreline . Within the reef the water was all colors : it was a deep and penetrating blue in the channels , and ran from a dark pure green through ochre to a light and coppery yellow , delimited into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral that had grown near to the surface . Within the multiple shallows of the ribs themselves the color was an aquamarine that was at once pale and brilliant , as only the color of water and jewels can be . Over the far ocean lay an infinite number of small clouds , white tinted to pink even in mid-afternoon , and they faded in the distance to a pale lavender-blue that ran so imperceptibly into the color of the sea that it was impossible to distinguish the horizon . I suppose we should have been silent the whole way , looking with curiosity ( or relief ) at this landscape , if one of the crew had n't come aft and said we could smoke if we wanted to . We all did want to , and smoking distracted us and soon we had introduced ourselves . The Sergeant of Marines spoke to me then . " You 're just out from the States ? " " Yes , " I said . " How 're things at home ? " he asked . There was in his voice almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing all right , " I said . " All right , " he repeated . " All right . " He looked at the Private . " He says they 're doing all right . " The Private said nothing . He merely smiled wryly and shook his head . " Must be hard on them to have to give up the movies now and then on account they ai n't got the gas to drive there , " said the Sergeant . " Must be tough , " said the Private . " Must be terrible you ca n't have a beefsteak every night for supper , workin ' forty hours a week . " " Let them eat Spam , " the Sergeant said . " That 'd be tough for them , " the Private said . " You 've been hearing the squawks , " I said . " In letters ? " " Hell , no , " said the Sergeant . " But we hear the squawks O.K. Plenty . " . " You always hear from the few squawkers , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who take it quietly and are glad to . " They both looked at me . I could see that this not only meant nothing to them , but that their minds were not open to it . " Must be hell to have only one cup a coffee each meal , " said the Private . He turned and looked out the window . So did the Sergeant . After a moment , so did 1 . The other three passengers were not listening to us . They were carrying on a conversation I could not hear over the noise of the motors . The coastal plain widened and flattened out after a bit , and the earth below us , where it was free of grass , was a whitish gray . The mountains to the east grew softer in outline and were less high and lovely . The barrier reef drew far out from the land and was broken by channels marked in the blue of depth . An hour from our take-off the plane landed at Donbouha on the wide , long runway paved in iron mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the heat again : And into the mosquitoes . I have been made fairly acquainted with mosquitoes , but never with any like these . They were very small , terrifyingly persistent , and they swarmed . I remember building smudges on the moors in Scotland to keep off midges that attacked in gray clouds , and the midges were hardly more numerous than these insects . After a while , you developed a curious immunity to them and merely brushed them off from time to time . But at first they were upsetting . We were put in a truck and driven , in a cloud of thick white dust , up a hill to a place where there were three unpainted Quonset huts in a row . Each had a sign on it . One said SCAT OPERATIONS HQ , No Admittance , On the others were written SCAT ENLISTED PERSONNEL , and SCAT OFFICERS , Information . Here our party separated and I entered the officers ' hut . It was screened and so there were only a few mosquitoes in it . It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped like half a tube some ten feet in radius and about forty feet long ) was insulated with brown fiber wallboard . About midway of the but was a counter that ran from wall to wall , and behind the counter was another Marine , a corporal , one of the best-looking men I 've ever seen . He was tall and very dark , with an olive skin and very black eyes and eyebrows . There were about fifteen officers seated on benches in the forward part of the hut . It is hard to tell the Army from the Navy down there , for no one wears a tunic or even a necktie , and the collar insignia of rank is the same . One has to spot the naval emblem pinned on the overseas cap , or , for the Army , the branch insignia on the left side of the collar . These officers , I discovered , were all Navy men . Some were asleep . Some were reading- almost disintegrated magazines or comics . From time to time the white dust of a passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the counter and I handed my orders ( in triplicate ) to the Corporal . He looked at me and took the orders and glanced at them . " How soon can I get a ride in to Tou6-bon ? " I asked . " I-low far is it ? " " About fifty miles , sir , " he said . " They 'll be a truck along soon fur all these gentlemen and you can ride in on her with them . " He looked at the orders again and he took them over to a desk and made a notation in a ledger and checked my name on a list there . Then he came back and handed me two copies and the third he clipped into a folder . " Just in ? " he said . " That 's right , " I said . " Come straight down from the States ? " " Almost without a stop , " I said . " How 're things at home ? " he asked . He smiled at me , a wide , derisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His tone was less bitter than that of the sergeant in the plane , but the question was still a challenge , not a request for information . " It 's coining along , " I said . Two of the young officers , an ensign and a lieutenant j.g. , rose and came and leaned on the counter . " Did you say you just got in ? " asked the Ensign . " Yes , " I said . " He says things at home is coming MAGAZINE along , " said the Corporal , as though he were including them in a private joke . They grinned at him . To me he said , " Must be tough at home now . " " No , " I said . " It 's not . Except for a few people . " " No cuffs on trousers , " said the Corporal . " No gas for the joy ride with the little woman , " said the Lieutenant . " An eight-hour day and time and a half for overtime , " said the Corporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I reckoned the only thing to do was to skip it , so I laughed . " It must seem so to you here , " I said . " Oh , here ! " he said and slapped a mosquito . " Here we got everything . We got everything in the world but strikes . We even got the Army now . " Suddenly his tone changed , he stopped smiling . " Yes , sir , not a strike . No God-damned strikes a-tall . Sure would like to see some of those by-God strikers set down here a while . They 'd all ought to be in the Army . Which is just what them poor Army bastards gets for men , at that . " His tone changed again , grew less vehement , lighter . " Seen the pome there ? " He pointed to the sloping wall behind me . There was a sheet of paper pinned up there , covered with typescript . " Better read that while you 're waiting . " Two more naval officers came in the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? " said the Marine . I turned and went over to the paper pinned on the wall , followed by the Lieutenant and the Ensign . I read the poem printed on the paper . Its author was given only as " A Captain of Marines , " and it was entitled " Our Fighting Men . " It was quite a poem . I 'll quote you the last verse of it , just to give a taste of its quality . It would not make you happy to hear more . All you need to know beyond those four lines is that it was a conversation in eight verses between a sailor , a marine , and a Seabee , who had all been long ( perhaps too long ) at Guadalcanal , on the day the Army arrived to take over there , and that the phrase , " our fighting men , " referred to the Army . The last verse went like this : " We can take it , " said a raider . " It wo n't be long Till the Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while later , we 'll be landing again , To make Bougainville safe  --  for our fighting men . " When I had read it I moved out of the way to let the two officers have my place . I watched them for a moment . They smiled as they read it , and when they were through they turned and called out to the Corporal . " That 's telling them , " they said . I did n't wait to hear what the Corporal said but went out . I had a feeling of being constricted in that hut . Seated by the road , on a suitcase , was a Commander . I went over and sat down next to him , and we fell into conversation , as one does so easily on those islands . It turned out that we came from the same part of the world , and we talked of that for a while . " What brings you here ? " I asked finally . " I 've had a slight go of malaria , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the naval hospital at Touebon , the one they call Mob 7 . There 's a car coming for me . Soon , I hope . " " Where 'd you get it ? " I asked . " Zipper , " he said . " I was there a bit too long . It 's good to get down here . " He smiled . " Comparatively speaking , it 's peaceful . " " Yes , " I said . " I suppose it is . Why do n't you go in out of these mosquitoes ? " " I do n't feel them any more , " he said . " It 's not so close out here . In there the heat makes me feel ill . " Just then a large open truck drove up in the usual choking cloud of dust . Thinking it might be mine , I rose and went inside the but to inquire . Most of the officers there were picking up their belongings as I entered . The Corporal was by the door . " Is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " he said . " Did you read that pome ? " " Yes , " I said . " That 's some pome , is n't it ? " " See that Commander outside ? " I said . " The one you was talking to ? " he said . " Yeah ? " " He 's ill , " I said . " He 's got malaria . " " We get lots of them , " said the Corporal . " He 's just back from Zipper , " I said . " He 's been there too long . Suppose he 'd been an Army officer ? " " Well ? " the Corporal said . " And had read that poem ? " He looked at me , smiling and saying nothing . He was enjoying the effect of the poem on me . " You 're the one that minds strikes , " I said . " At home . " He looked puzzled . " I do n't get it , " he said . Then he added quickly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a hand with it . " He held the screen door open . We went out and he put my stuff on the truck , and he gave a hand to the other officers . As soon as we were loaded up we drove off . I could see the Corporal standing by the side of the road , near the Commander , looking after us till the dust hid him . We were driven in to Touebon  --  a long and beautiful and dangerous drive through mountains . All the vegetation was new to me , and so were the flowers that grew here , even in late autumn , in profusion by the roadside . In the dusk the country had great beauty and a singular smell of slightly musty hay . But with all the novelty of it , I kept thinking of the poem on the wall , and " How 're things at home ? " I said to myself over and over , like a tune you ca n't get rid of . It was a bong time before I got to Donbouha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things . I drove up this time in the late afternoon in the great comfort of a command car  --  a far different trip from that wild ride down in a truck that fled in the dusk over what used to be called , on the gasoline maps of home , an " old-type mountain road . " But the place looked just the same , and the mosquitoes were just as bad as before , and when I entered the Quonset hut , the dark and handsome Corpora/ was still behind the desk , and the poem was still on the wall . I gave him my orders , and he checked me off for the SCAT plane north to Val des Naoulis , which was to leave in an hour . Then he took a copy of my orders , as before , and clipped it into his folder . " Going north ? " he said . " No , " I said . " Home . " " You was through here before , " he said . " You and a friend of yours had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good memory , " I said . " Can I get something to eat ? " " Sure , " he said . " Follow the road uphill to the right and take your first right turn . Second but you come to . " I had hardly got down the steps of the but when I ran into Arthur Flaggen . Arthur and I were at school together . I could see he was a major in the Infantry now , and that he looked ill and gray . " For God 's sake ! " I said . " For Christ 's sake ! " he said . He held his left hand out to me . I noticed then that his right hand was bandaged and that the dressing ran half way up his arm , for his shirt sleeves were rolled back to the elbows . When we had got over exclaiming at meeting each other and I had told him all I knew of home news I asked him to come along and have some food . " I just ca n't eat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there and get checked in for transportation to the hospital in Tou6bon . " " Oh , " I said , " that can wait . Come and watch me eat . It 's hot as hell in there . " " All right , " he said . " I guess there 's no rush . " We walked up to the mess shack and he sat with me while I fed , " What did you get in the arm ? " I asked . " Oh , that ! " he said . " Shucks , that 's nothing . I got a little wound in the hand and one through the arm . That 'll be O.K. in time . " " You do n't look too robust , " I said . " No , " he said . " And I feel like hell . I was up on Guadalcanal for a while and I got malaria and then I got this little business , and later on the malaria came back on me . That was n't so bad , but now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so hot the third time . " " You 'd better get a rest , " I said , " and shake it altogether . " " That 's it , " he said . " I tried to stay too long . You hate to leave . I have a fine outfit . They 're good now . " The pride in his voice was pleasant to hear . " Did you go up to Guadalcanal with the first lot ? " I asked . " Yes , " he said . " We were lucky . " " That 's one way of looking at it . " I paid for my food and we left , walking back to the Quonset hut . I was slapping at the mosquitoes half the time . I had been at sea and had grown unaccustomed to them . He paid them no attention . On the way back we talked  --  of home , of school , of the last war  --  but I was wondering all that time whether I had the nerve to take that poem down before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ? " I asked . " No , " he said . " First time here at Donbouha . " " Have you been in to the SCAT but to ask for transportation ? " " Not yet , " he said . " But they telephoned about it . I went up to see the officer in charge , up the hill there , because I 'd had one cable and I wondered if there 'd be another . " " Was there ? " " Yes , " he said ; and then suddenly , " My father has died . " " Your father ? " I said . " But he was n't old ! " " No , " he said . " He was the youngest man I ever knew . No one at home with my mother now . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " Poor feller . " He walked along beside me in silence for a while . Then he said , " I feel better for having had someone to spill it to . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shape for it . " " No , " I said . " You 're not . It 's hard enough anyway . Will you go home ? " " No , " he said . " What 's the use ? I 'd rather keep at it here . My sister 's not married . She can look after Mother . I sort of like my outfit . I think they like me . It 'll be easier to be at the job here . " " That could well be , " I said . We were at the but now . The late afternoon sun slanted into it . The Corporal stood just inside the screening , lit by the sunlight . " Sit here , " I said . " I 'll find out for you . " " Oh , no , " he said . " I 'll go in . " " It 's hot as hell in there , " I said . " Sit here . I can do it easily . " " No , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you as well as your papers . " Together we went up to the hut . I saw the Corporal looking at us and then he disappeared . I knew then that I should either get that damned poem down or get Arthur out before he saw it . We mounted the steps and went in . He walked straight to the desk . I heard the Corporal say , " Yes , sir , Major ? " I turned at once to the wall . The poem was gone . I waited . When Arthur was through he came back to me . " I 'll sit outside , ' " he said . " It is hot here . " " Yes , " I said . " Go on . I 'll be right out . " He went through the screen door and down the steps and sat on the ditch edge by the road , in the shade of the next hut . When he was out I turned to the Corporal , who was busily writing at his desk . " You took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me briefly , and he said , " He looked real sick . They telephoned me about him and all . " " Yes , but why ? " I persisted : " I recalled what you said about strikes , " he said . " At home and here . I aim to burn it up . So you 're going home now ? " " Yes , " I said . " Tell them how 're things out here , " he said . " I will , " I said . And I went out into the mosquitoes to join the Major . I sat down by his right side . He had his cap off , and with the gold leaf on his opened shirt collar lie might as well have belonged to the Navy .
