By MAURICE ZOLOTOW IRA SCHUSTER , a Broadway song writer , was standing in front of the Brill Building , a fifteen- story place on 49th Street and Broadway inhabited entirely by music publishers and known to the trade simply as The Building . Schuster is a plump short man who wears glasses and a big hat set squarely on his head . He started out in the music business in 1913 at Leo Feist , Inc. , giving away free professional copies of the latest Feist songs to vaudeville singers . Later , like Irving Berlin and George Gershwin , he was a demonstrator of new tunes . In 1918 he began writing lyrics , and his biggest hit was A Shanty in Old Shantytown . Even before Pearl Harbor , Schuster had been a prolific writer of patriotic chansons , with I Am an American , They 're Makin ' Me MI Over in the Army , and Hats Off to MacArthur to his credit . Schuster was standing there , rhythmically grinding a piece of gum as if it were a cud , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song pluggers and band leaders , who were gathered in gossipy little circles in front of The Building . Ever since Pearl Harbor , Schuster , like most of the 1200 members of the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers  --  ASCAP  --  had been unable to worry about whether the girl should croon ' neath the moon in June . Since he was close to fifty years old , he felt that his best contribution to our fight could be a fighting song . He was thinking about this and about where to go for dinner when he saw Nelson Cogane , one of the younger members of ASCAP . Cogane was a stocky person , an ex-prize fighter from Dayton , Ohio , with a flattened nose . His biggest hit was 1941 's We Three  --  My Echo , My Shadow and Me . He and Schuster both write lyrics , not melody . They decided to have dinner together at Gallagher 's steak place on 52nd Street . During the meal they mulled over the headlines and worked out some problems in logistics and tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cogane , it developed , A unique note-by-note account of the fabulous antics that go into producing an actual song . This could be the turning point . Al Jolson says he may be able to use it . was much upset , because he had read that they were putting up a democratic government-in-exile for Germany . " Those Germans , " he said , " they do n't deserve a government ; we should cut them up in little pieces . " PHOTOGRAPHY BY SAM FALK 16 " Yes , " agreed Schuster , " that 's the only way to make sure we will never have another war . " Cogane backed his chair away . He sat still and thought . Then he suddenly flattened his right hand out and smacked his head . " Listen , Ira , " he enunciated carefully ; " you got a stick of dynamite there . " " Huh ' ? " Schuster stopped spreading a potato and glanced up . " I mean what you just said  --  There 'll Never be Another War . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his food . He put a stick of gum in his mouth . " It 's a wonderful title , " he agreed . They both arose as if they were in a trance . " There will never be another war , " murmured Schuster . Repeating the title dreamily several times , they drifted out into the street . In a popular song , usually the words come first , generally the title . Completely in a world of their own , unaware of the teeming throngs on Broadway , the two lyricists absently wandered over to Eighth Avenue , up to Columbus Circle , back down Broadway to Times Square . They were vehemently giving each other possible lines for the first chorus , arguing over every syllable , but not making any notes on paper . At first the song went : There 'll never be another war , We 'll fight and we 'll work As we never did before , So there 'll never be another war . Schuster did n't like the way the first stanza went . " We do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " we got to lead into it . " Cogane pursed his lips and thought hard . Schuster said , " Why do n't we try it this way ? Why do n't we make it a soldier , or a general , or something  --  say President Roosevelt  --  and he is talking to the people and saying , ' Come on , fellers , let 's work and fight Saturday night , and a visit to a friend in Westchester on Sunday . All Saturday night he wrestled with cadences at the piano . All Sunday morning and afternoon he hiked around Central Park , and he repeated the lines over and over again . By Sunday night , when he was about to succumb to the screaming tneenaies , he suddenly stumbled into the solution . What he needed was an extra " we 're gon na make sure " in order to balance the stanza properly . It must read like this : Why are we working and fighting Like we never did before ? Why , we wan na make sure , We wan na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new construction released the log jam in his subconscious . The melody now poured out  --  a steady , pounding , triumphant melody . Right away he telephoned Schuster , and on Monday night the three collaborators met for the first time in Meyer 's apartment at West End Avenue and 91st Street to finish the song . They stood around the living room of the apartment , with Cogane and Schuster leaning over the expanse of a concert grand piano , watching Meyer , seated at the keyboard , as he scratched notes on a sheet of paper with blank musical staffs printed on it . There were two heavy Regency stuffed chairs in the room , a Chippendale occasional chair , a long dark red couch , and also a mantelpiece over the fireplace . But when they started digging , Cogane and Schuster did not sit down or even lean on the mantelpiece . Meyer played his strain several times ; he played with a bold attack , striking the melody part strongly , and improvising a bass accompaniment with the left hand . He played it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How does it sound ? " Schuster asked . " That 's it , " Cogane said . " Well , let 's get going , " said Meyer . Schuster spat and started a new piece of gum . He is a chain gum chewer . They were now having trouble with the second stanza . Cogane knew he had to have a key word rhyming with " war , " because the title , There 'll Never Be Another War , was repeated in the next stanza . They tried a lot of words that rhymed with " war , " but they did n't sound right . Meyer said the trouble was they were too tightened up . He opened the door and asked his wife to bring in some ice-cold cokes . None of them drink whisky while they are working , although there is a popular legend that the best songs are written by writers in an alcoholic stupor , preferably while rolling in some gutter off Broadway . Cogane began working on the cokes . He turned out to be a chain coke drinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box of candy . When the candy arrived , he whistled for Tim to come into the room . Tim was a shaggy dog , a Kerry blue terrier . He had a habit of wagging his tail and growling simultaneously . " If I give him a piece of candy , " said Meyer , " he plays the piano . " " Send the dog away , Joe , " pleaded Cogane . " I am afraid of dogs . " " Wait till you see him do this trick , " said Meyer .. . " Play , " he said to the dog . The dog obediently loped over to the piano , jumped on the bench and ran his paws over the keys . " Ile plays a great boogie-woogie piano , " said Schuster . Everybody laughed and the tension was broken . The dog received his candy and , after growling several times at Cogane , he loped out of the room . Meyer returned to the piano . Now Schuster tried singing the first stanza . He had a thick , unmelodious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cogane 's eyes . He took off his coat and vest . Schuster also stripped , but kept his hat on his head . " What are we going through ? " Cogane said grimly . " We are going through hell . Now , if I could get a word that gives the idea of hell to rhyme with war " It went on like this for about an hour , with Meyer insisting that flames do not roar , but finally the stanza emerged : Why will we follow " Old Glory " Where the flames and cannon roar ? Why , we wan na make sure , We wan na make sure , There 'll never be another war . The release was n't so hard to construct , because they had swung into the tempo . At first the release went : We 're gon na end the threat To life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . Then Schuster remembered a comment Winkle made while speaking to Stalin . He had complimented the Soviet dictator for keeping his eye on the ball . So a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking shape like this : We 're in line , we 're all in line , And we 're gon na keep our eye on the ball . You can be we 'll end the threat To life , liberty , happiness , Once and for all . The " happiness " was struck out , because Meyer said it would spoil the meter . Cogane said it was a shame they could n't have kept intact the whole phrase from the Declaration of Independence . The last lines of the release finally stood as : You can bet we 'll end the threat To life and liberty , Once and for all . By 2:30 A.m. the final stanza was almost done : When we 've destroyed those destroyers , When we 've evened up the score , Then we 're gon na make sure , We 're gon na make sure , There 'll never be another war . Meyer was afraid the stanza was ambiguous , because some people might think they meant a destroyer , like a ship . But it stayed that way . Then Schuster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't end on a note of hopefulness and peace . " Peace ? that 's it ! " practically shrieked Cogane , striding down the room and punching the piano . " That sums up the whole idea and ties it together . " In its final version , the stanza reads : When we 've destroyed those destroyers , There 'll be peace forevermore , For we 're gon na make sure , We 're gon na make sure , There 'll never be another war . Love versus War You would think that three veteran song writers , each of whom has several smash hits to his by-line , wuuld have no trouble getting a new song published . But a war song is an uncertain business proposition , because the romantic female adolescents who buy most of the sheet music do not buy war songs , but prefer ballads about love , and it requires at least $10,000 to start a new song moving , and the sheet-music sales must cover this overhead ; so that on a war song the pro has as much trouble as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite impossible to get a hearing for his brain children , let alone a contract with a cash advance . Cogane , Schuster and Meyer decided first to try the tune on the Edwin H. Morris music company , in which Bing Crosby is a silent partner . The first to listen to the song was Dave Kent , a song plugger at Morris ' . Kent was a wiry , highly polished , tightly dressed chap , who was chewing gum in a hard way . He listened to There 'll Never Be Another War , and there was no expression on his face . He did not say " yes , he did not say " no , " he did not say " maybe . " He did not even scowl . He just listened to the song and walked out briskly . Cogane looked at Schuster desperately . Schuster waved his hands about . " He loves it , " said Schuster . Notes Without a Home Then Harry Spitzer , the professional manager , a tall , heavy man , came in . He heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he sang the words with his jaw bravely jutting out . Spitzer was also a dead pan . He made a remark about the weather and was speedily on his way out . Cogane and Meyer stared at each other in terror . " That Spitzer , he loves it , " assured Schuster , slapping a new piece of gum into his mouth . " He 's just a cold guy on the surface , that 's all . " Finally , Edwin H. ( " Buddy " ) Morris strode in and listened to the song . He was not exactly a dead pan . He at least had some sort of expression on his face , even if it was only an expression of profound ennui . He studied his fingernails with great detachment as Meyer pounded away at the song . After Morris departed , Schuster said , " He loves it . " A moment later , Spitzer reappeared . He said , " Sorry , boys , we ca n't use it . We do n't need any flag wavers . " The song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great song , the Over There of this war . But now they figured , instead of tackling the publishers , they would try it from another angle ; they would show the song around to their friends and see if they could get some performances on the radio , and in this way they would have no trouble finding a publisher . They first mailed two copies , to Washington , D. C. , with a dollar , to the Copyright Office , where , each year , 25,000 tunes are copyrighted . Schuster looked at his watch , and he said he thought they had time to catch Laura Deane Dutton , a Blue Network ( Continued on Page 56 ) ( Continued from Page 54 ) singer , who was taking a lesson from Bernie Wayne . Mr. Wayne 's studio was on the fourth floor of the Brill Building . Miss Dutton turned out to be a tall gorgeous dish in a blue , fleecy sweater , and she evinced much interest in the song . " Laura , " said Schuster fervently , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I show it to . It 's dynamite . Whatever singer gets associated with it is lucky . " Miss Dutton said she would show the song to her arranger and she would perhaps do it on her program two weeks from this Wednesday . After this , Schuster hastened over to the Circus Bar of the Hotel Piccadilly , where the Three Suns , a group playing an electric organ , a guitar and an accordion , were having a rehearsal . The Three Suns  --  who are so-called because their slogan is : " We Herald the Dawn of New Rhythms " ? seemed quite impressed by the song . " A song Like this , " remarked Arthur Dunn , the electric organist , who doubled as vocalist , " could do something to people . You sure you did n't show this to anybody ? " " Artie , " said Schuster , " you could be the first to introduce this song and I tell you it will be an honor . " Peddling Dynamite Dunn asked his partners , Al Nevins and Morty Nevins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had a real punch . " Punch ? " said Schuster scornfully . " Why , it 's dynamite ! " Dunn glanced over the harmonized lead sheet and began slowly to hum the melody . " I like the thought of it , " he said ; " it hits the point . " " Sure , " said Schuster , " that 's what the whole world is trying to say . " " Well , " said Dunn , " why do n't you leave this lead sheet here , and we will try to get up an arrangement of it and maybe do it on WRAF next Monday ? " Schuster then folded his envelope of lead sheets under his arm and proceeded to the Hotel Astor Roof , where Les Brown 's band was playing . He checked his coat , but not his hat , and swaggered over to a table . He grinned warmly when Brown , having completed a set , joined him . ' ? " That last number you did , " Schuster said , grinning , " that arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This part of the routine is known as romancing the band leader , and it is very critical , because the band leaders with radio wires are the single most important factor in introducing and speeding a new tune into national popularity today . But Brown , a youngish chap with a round face and curly black hair , was apparently inured to romance . He sat down , his face a dead pan . Schuster began to talk about the song , wearing his best expression of bonhomie , " This is not the ordinary kind of a war 4 song . " Brown , looking very unhappy , began to study the manuscript and beat out the rhythm with a cocktail swizzle stick . " It 's a good commercial tune , " Brown said . He reread the manuscript and softly hummed the melody again , this time jiving it up . " Maybe I could use this for my quartet , " he said . Schuster left a copy with Brown . Then he taxied over to the Hotel Commodore to call on Maestro Vaughn Monroe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dressed in evening clothes . He walked over as soon as he spotted Schuster , because they were old friends . But Monroe also assumed the dead-pan mask when he realized that Schuster was bringing with him a song . However , he lighted a cigarette and pa. tiently studied the lead sheet . He said that , being a vocalist , he mainly concentrated on the lyric when he examined a new tune . " If the words make sense , I will go for it , " he said . " I like this one . It carries a good solid message . " ( Continued on Page 59 ) fConlihued From Page 56 ) The rest of the week , Schuster carried his propaganda to Maestro Bob Allen , to Harry Richman , Vincent Lopez , songstress Mary Small , petite vocalist Marion Loveridge , who sang a patriotic song every week on the Olivio Santoro program and had become known as the Betsy Ross of the Air Lanes . On Friday afternoon , Joe Meyer dropped over to see Al Jolson with a copy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the song , as he had just got a new commercial radio show and was picking his songs very carefully . But Meyer was an old pal of Jolson 's , and had once been his accompanist in a vaudeville act . Two days later came exciting news  --  Al Jolson was interested in the song . Then bulletins began to pile up . Jolson was getting his arranger busy on the song . Jolson might sing it on his next program . Finally , Jolson actually opened his show the following Tuesday with a rousing interpretation of There 'll Never Be Another War , an interpretation that made the song a stirring drama and made the listener 's skin tingle and his eyes grow moist . Potential Profits Next day the news had sifted into Lindy 's and around The Building , and the three writers were already holding out for the most substantial advance and the best contract . They had made an offthe-air recording of Jolson 's interpretation , and when they sat down to demonstrate their song to grizzled , gray-haired Max Mayer , cigar-smoking president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the clincher . Mayer deliberated for less than five minutes , and then he pulled out a checkbook and gave them a $500 advance , and signed the standard Song Writers ' Protective Association contract with Cogane , Schuster and Meyer . If There 'll Never Be Another War is any sort of a hit  --  if it sells 500,000 sheet-music copies and several million records  --  the song writers stand to make around $12,000 apiece the first year . They receive five cents on every piano copy sold in a department or music store , and the nickel is split three ways . On recordings , known in the trade as mechanicals , the publisher splits fifty-fifty with the writers , and he receives a cent and a half for each record sold of There 'll Never Be Another War . Mayer 's problem was how to circumvent the Petrillo ban on recordings , and he thought it might be possible to make a strictly vocal recording of it , with one voice soloing and a choir in the background , and using no instruments . In Search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason , a high-priced freelance arranger , to get up a dance orchestration of the piece for sixteen musicians . Mason 's fee was $150 . This orchestration , known as the stock arrangement , is furnished to smaller bands who can not afford to hire their own individual arrangers . Next , he got out 5000 professional piano copies of the tune , and had his two New York song pluggers and his men in Chicago and Los Angeles begin to contact radio singers , name bands and Hollywood stars , and persuade them to perform the " greatest war song since Pearl Harbor . " There 'll Never Be Another War became what is called the No. 1 plug song at Paull-Pioneer , which meant that the professional staff dropped its work on all the other songs in the catalogue and concentrated its exploitation efficiency on this alone . Full of enthusiasm himself , Mayer took the song out himself , and made a swing of the largest cities in the East and Midwest , and talked about the song to maestros like Dick Jurgens , Chico Marx and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every music dealer on his list . " We 're all out for this song , " he remarked ; " we 're going to invest maybe ten , twelve thousand dollars on trying to put this song over . We know we can get it played by the big hands and heard over the air . But we do n't know if it will he a hit . Only the public picks the hits . Anyway , we feel it 's a good song . " " Good ? " said Schuster . " Listen . It 's dynamite ! "
