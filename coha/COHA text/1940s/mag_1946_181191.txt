The warborn shortage of telephones frustrated life in many a U.S. home . In New York City alone last week , despite the addition of a new exchange ( Plaza 9 ) , 320,000 applicants were still waiting to clutch a phone of their own . <P> An alarmed New York Telephone Co. reported that daily calls had risen to a whopping 12,815,000 after V-J day-over a third more than the average prewar chatter . Conversations over private lines were getting longer &; longer ; wires were especially busy on rainy days , Mondays , and days after holidays . Observed the New York Daily News : " The telephone people are n't telling which sex gets on a busy wire and talks for half-hour stretches about two-egg cakes and such things . We 're not sticking our neck out , either . . . . We 've just got an epidemic of telephonitis on our hands and . . . we doubt if it 'll ever be cured . "                  @ @ @
