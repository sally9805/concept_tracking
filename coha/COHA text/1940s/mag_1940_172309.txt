THE PEOPLE TALK-Benjamin Appel-Dutton ( $3 ) . <P> Benjamin Appel ( Brain Guy , The Power-House ) is a young man with an honest if unextraordinary eye , a careful ear for dialect , a quiet talent for quickly gaining the confidence of strangers . With this equipment , during 1939 and 1940 , he covered the U. S. , north &; south , coast to coast . Everywhere he went he talked to people , listened to them , watched the work they did , the streets and country around them . His book is made of what he heard and saw , chiefly of what they said . <P> Mainly they were poor people , mainly interested in talking not about the war , nor politics , but about themselves : where they came from , what work they had done and were doing , what they got for it , whether that was enough to live on , what they thought about it . They include a Wisconsin farmer , a textile worker in Lawrence , Mass. , an Indian storekeeper in New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model in Provincetown , an out-of-luck research scientist running a sound mixer in Hollywood , a Polish iron miner in the Mesabi , a whitewing on Manhattan 's West End Avenue , cane cutters in Louisiana , cotton farmers in Mississippi , a salmon fisherman in Oregon , a steel-worker in Birmingham . <P> Because Benjamin Appel is not a great artist , The People Talk is in a sense disappointing . But the talk is set down in patience and detail , and it is good talk . The talkers have great variety , almost invariable dignity . Their occupations are described with skill and immediacy . In the quiet course of this long book , it achieves a grandeur founded not on rhetoric but on existence : an image of the intricate texture , the massiveness , the simultaneity of a continent and its people .
