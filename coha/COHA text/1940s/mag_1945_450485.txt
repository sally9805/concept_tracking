IT WAS a zebra in a Duke 's back yard which bit me into radar in 1939 . Otherwise I should have known nothing about it . Zebra stallions are uncommon in our quiet English countryside . They are not , as zoologists would say , indigenous . But just before war broke out , it chanced that I was badly chewed by a vicious specimen and was rushed to the operating table of a hospital which ? embarrassingly ? specialized in maternity . After that , not even radar surprised inc very much . In those early days , the War Office was besieged by volunteers , and officers were harassed . Perhaps that explains it . " What happened to you ? " asked the man to whom I offered my services , as he eyed my sling and bandages . " I 've been bitten by a zebra , " I replied , believing , quaintly , that one should always tell the truth to Full Colonels . " This , " he replied , reddening like a fighting fish that has just seen another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I think he must have had ulcers . I did not know the Wing Commander well , but we had sometimes had a drink together at the Club . One night he tackled me before I had even had time to order . " Will you join the RAF tomorrow morning ? " he asked abruptly . " Does the RAF mind zebra bites ? " I countered , still smarting from the Colonel . " They need men so desperately for certain duties that you could have been sat on by an elephant for all they care , " he replied . " There is no man in England , " I protested , " who knows less about the RAF than I do . I had planned to join the Army . I 'm too old to fly . What do you want me to do ? " " It 's so secret I ca n't tell you , " he replied . " How would I start ? " I asked . " Be at the Air Ministry at nine o'clock tomorrow and I 'll send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And can you bring two others with you ? " I sipped my drink and asked a few questions . It all seemed genuine enough and urgent . " Would you take a Member of Parliament and a man who has spent all his life in China ? Wu-Hu or Hu-Wu or somewhere ? " We are up against it . We 'll take almost anything . That 's why I asked you , " he said , with what I thought was unnecessary candor . Much telephoning and several drinks ? with the result that the man from Wu-Hu , the Honorable Member , and I reported in Whitehall at nine o'clock the next morning . An Air Ministry car was waiting and bore us swiftly out of London to our secret destination . " You must be prepared to servo for weeks without uniforms or pay " were the Wing Commander 's parting words . " There 's no time to wait for that sort of thing . I 've told ' em you 're corning and are ready to start right away . And remember ? what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must not breathe a syllable to any living soul . " " Where are you taking us ? " we asked the driver . The driver put his finger to his lips . Obviously another Phillips Oppenheim fan . Another Wing Commander met us . He was plainly unused to assorted civilians . " Will you tell me , " he asked with some embarrassment , " what your civilian experience has been ? " " This man , " I said breaking an awkward silence , " is a Member of Parliament , that one has spent all his life in Wu-Hu , and I am a newspaperman . " The Wing Commander was visibly shaken . But he rallied himself with an effort . " Thank you , " he said . " I think we had better get right on with it . " We followed him as he led the way to the most amazing room in the world . It was a large , lofty room , and in the center was a huge table covered with a giant map of England and adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sat " plotters , " connected by telephone to many distant radar stations and ready to put down a symbol on the map as soon as an approaching aircraft was reported . For a long time no aircraft had been able to approach or leave England without its being known in that room . The plane that took Mr. Chamberlain to Munich had been " watched " by the high-power radar stations of the " coastal chain . " Around the walls and overlooking the map was a gallery from which " controllers " and other officers with multifarious and unintelligible duties could supervise what was going on below . Ours were to be some of these unintelligible duties . The inmates were ? for the most part ? friendly but far too busy to give any detailed explanations or to show us how to do what we were supposed to do . " You must pick it up for yourselves , " said the Wing Commander later , " somehow . No one has time to train you . You had better go to the coast tomorrow and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trained to go on watch within a week , These fellows on the job here are wanted urgently somewhere else . " " This , " said the man from the Far East , " is very different from Wu-Hu . " " I must get a book on cathode-ray tubes ? or whatever they call them ? to read in bed , " said the Member of Parliament . But a twinge from my zebra bite made me wonder whether Science or Fate was the more remarkable . 2 AMILE away , silhouetted against a scudding English sky , the giant , grotesque towers of a high-power radar station suggested something II . G. Wells might have dreamed up in an exalted moment . But in the taproom of the " Goat and Compasses " inn , where we went to restore ourselves after a dazzling introduction to radiolocation ( as we used to call it ) , everything was much the same as it had been for two hundred years or more . Conversation soon drifted to those mystery towers , though we , of course , kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airyplanes , " observed the little man in the corner . " They does it with a ray wet comes out of the top and mooks oop their engines . Then they falls into the sea ? and serve ' em dang well right . " " That 's a daft word , " retorted a cynic , lounging against the bar . " Them 's got no ray . ' T ai n't sinse . Them 's for they RAF chaps to climb up ? seed ' em doing it ? so 's they can see the Germans a-comin ' . Then they blows a whistle to them young gals down below in the ' uts . " " Proper cold for ' em , pore fellers , " commented a practical-looking ancient with a clay pipe . " No . It 's a ray wot does it , orlright , " interposed a lorry driver . " Only a week come Tuesday , pal o ' mine saw three lorries and two cars stuck on the road right by them towers . Saw it with ' is own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an RAF bloke come out and saw wot was ' appenin ' . Then ' e went inside and turned off the ray and they all started up a treat . Me pal did n't ' arf larfl " We finished our beer and left , reflecting that some Security Officers must have done a pretty good job . In the far-off United States they had begun to talk about a " phony " war . But to the RAF there was nothing phony about it , and in the secret Radar Control Room ( they called it a " Filter Room " ) vigilance was never relaxed day or night . Many times each second , for twenty-four hours a day , the coastal chain of huge radar stations flung etheric " pulses " far over the North Sea ; and scarcely an hour passed but that a returning radio " echo " brought tidings of some enemy activity to the quiet room with its huge maps and innumerable telephones . Tonight there was unusual excitement . A new station was going " on the air " for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . They were not long in coming . Aircraft were detected off the coast approaching England on an unusual course . A rapid check indicated that they must be hostile . It was a wild and dirty winter 's night with sleet and snow on the coast . No friendly aircraft in their senses would be flying in that area , and no fighters could possibly take off to intercept the enemy . Hostile aircraft were still sufficiently infrequent to cause some excitement . ( This was late 1939 . ) The alarm went out . A large part of England was " put under a red . " In a few minutes , in distant towns and villages , the screaming sirens brought air-raid wardens tumbling from their warm beds to stagger through the blizzard to their posts . All stations in the neighborhood were warned to check on the approaching enemy , but all reported that they could " see " nothing . Very Senior Officers came into the Filter Room . Away in Whitehall , their Lordships of the Admiralty viewed with concern and diverted certain naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this happened in a matter of minutes . Then the new station reported that the aircraft had disappeared . But before the warnings could be called off or the excitement subside , more aircraft were sighted in the original position and on the original course . Excitement revived . Then some alert expert had the presence of mind to work out the speed of the approaching enemy . He found it was sixty miles an hour . An aircraft doing only sixty miles an hour must be a new and sinister form of German secret weapon . Excitement grew and tension mounted . " Perhaps , sir , " I suggested to a Very Senior Officer , " the new equipment is not working properly ? " The VSO glowered at me as if I had snickered in church . " Sure no other stations are picking ' em up ? Make another check . " Feeling put in my place , I flicked the phone keys under my hand and talked to six radar stations in rapid succession . The tone of the replies suggested that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reported this to the VSO the message came that the aircraft had disappeared again . Six times that night the same thing happened ? aircraft at approximately sixty miles an hour , with the wind behind them , following the same course , and always disappearing in the same position . " I believe , " said the VSO reluctantly , " that the new equipment needs some adjustment . Send doWn a maintenance party and tell ' em to drive like hell . Give ' em the O.K. to use headlights , and warn the police . " I made the necessary calls . " And you might ask the new station once more , " said the VSO , " exactly what they think they are seeing . " A young Scientific Officer at the other end of the line was , palpably hurt . " German aircraft , of course , " he replied in an offended tone . " Well , " I said caustically , " if you 've been seeing German aircraft all night , you 've got a private andexclusive blitz in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His reply suggested that I was a crude fellow with no appreciation of the wonders of science in general and of his new equipment in particular . But the VSO decided to take the station off the air till the scientists could look it over . The order went forth and the room resumed its early morning calm . The alerts were canceled , wardens staggered back to bed , and the WAAF " tellers " and " plotters " resumed their knitting or their detective stories , according to their tastes . In the Admiralty , their Lordships no longer viewed with concern . The VSO went to bed . It was not until next day , after the Scientific Officers had been in a lengthy huddle , that the awful truth emerged . No Luftwaffe had been abroad that night . No sixty-mile-an-hour monstrosity had menaced the safety of the English coast . But Central Europe was freezing up , and geese were flying to wherever they go when Europe gets too cold for them . In their migration , successive gaggles had flown into range of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alighted on sandbanks to rest and thus faded from its sight . Even now some of the die-hard Scientific Officers will not openly admit that this story is true . But I was kept from a cigarette for over five hours and have reason to know that it is . And if that is not enough , I can report a conversation I overheard later in the mess . One of the scientists was talking to a colleague , a can of beer in one hand and a slide rule in the other . " I have just worked out , " he said , in the tone in which an artist discusses his masterpiece , " that the wing span of an Average Goose is a by no means impossible harmonic of lambda . " " That 's significant , " said his friend with a look of admiration . " Very significant . " This was clearly a Turning Point in Science and the two men enjoyed the exaltation of the moment . No man in history had ever before calculated the wavelength of an Average Goose . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publish the discovery . This was a moment for celebration . " This is a great occasion , " said the man with the slide rule as he pressed the bell for the waiter . " Let 's have the other half-can . " In the Admiralty , when they heard the story , their Lordships viewed it in a rather different light . Many people had lost their sleep , and much fuel oil had been expended . Only the geese resumed their untroubled way . 3 AT 0400 human vitality , it is said , is at its lowest ebb , and the human mind is apt to miss on several cylinders . Officers on watch in the Radar Filter Room were no exception to this rule . To make matters worse , many of us were only days from civil life and still hazy about the technicalities , complexities , and code words that were spoken unceasingly over the secret telephone network that linked radar stations from Scotland to the South Coast with the incredible Control Room where we worked . Few of us knew anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dreamed that radar was even a possibility till a short time before , so well had the secret been kept . Now we were supposed to understand ? and act on ? a strange new jargon in a strango new world where daylight never penetrated , where telephones never stopped posing conundrums , and where senior and genuine 1AF officers regarded the likes of us with an undorstandable suspicion . For in those early days cm might easily have confused a cathode-ray tube a Air Vice Marshal . Only that evening one of us had cracked under the strain . The Controller was in a bad mood . Three stations had had technical trouble at an awkward moment and the stand-by equipment , which was switched on to cover the gaps , was never entirely satisfactory . " Get hold of moss at once , " he snapped to my colleague at the other position in the gallery , which overlooked the great plotting table with its squared map of England . My colleague had not fully recovered from ten minutes on the phone with one of the stations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room , invariably reported its technical dilemmas in the most impenetrable Glasgow accent . And now this was too much . " I will , sir , " he said politely but wearily , " if you will kindly tell me whether moss is a code word , a piece of apparatus , or one of the airmen . " Then , at 0400 , I fell right into it myself . My mind , I confess , was wandering . A few feet away sat a WAAF teller placidly knitting " tiny garments " for a pregnant married sister , apparently oblivious of the miraculous nature of her duties and of the incongruity of knitting woolly panties in such a Wellsian atmosphere . Yet I knew she watched the map the whole time with one eye , ready to warn the fighter stations of approaching German bombers . I was wondering whether I should ever again be able to see a baby wearing pink woolly panties without remembering this fantastic place , when a light flashed on the long switchboard under my hand . I touched a key and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far North ; the voice was pregnant with urgency . " Gertie , " it said , " is all right . " " What 's that ? " I asked , trying to remember what " Gertie " stood for in the code book . The voice became even more insistent and impressive . " Gertie is all right , " it repeated with renewed . fervor . Then , by ill fortune , the line went dead and I had to warn the engineers to fix it . " Gertie " was not in the code book . But obviously the matter was urgent . I roused the Controller from his crossword puzzle . " Gertie , sir , " I said with all the assurance one can muster at 0400 , " is all right . " I might have known from the look of blank astonishment that the Controller had not the faintest idea what Gertie was , and did not like to admit it , But in those days I thought Controllers were supermen and knew everything . " Quite so , " he said hesitantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " After a few moments he came over to my position On the gallery . " The message , " he said , " is not quite clear . But as we can not query it till the line is repaired , we had better not take any chances . Tell the Groups . " The gist of what the Groups replied sleep . ily was that Gertie 's condition did not interest them at all . " Better warn the Army , " said the Controller , " Might be one of their ack-ack parties . " The Army , after ' much telephoning , disowned Gertie in no uncertain terms . " Get onto the Admiralty and ask them what they think should be done , " said the Controller . But after much nautical ribaldry from the recesses of Whitehall it appeared that the Royal Navy took much the same view of Gertie as the Army . They suggested , however , that it was probably a matter for the Ministry of Home Security . Every department or agency connected with the Radar Control Room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each case ? except for one free and independent civilian in one of the departments , who dared reply that he did not know who or what Gertie was and at that hour of the night was in no particular mood to make a study of the subject . Both the Controller and I wore on the spot . For by now a largo part of England had been alerted about Gertie 's condition , and the more conscientious officers ? having thumbed their code books in vain ? were now calling back for further details from every corner of Britain 's defense network . " I think , " said the Controller in a voice which showed he was a born leader , " we had better make sure the original message was passed correctly . If the line 's been fixed , call the station and tell them we think they must be using the wrong code . Be careful what you say ? you must not discuss code , words too freely even on our lines . " I got through to that infernal station in the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I can summon at 0400 , exactly what they meant by their message about Gertie . " Blimey , sir , I 'm sorry , " came the reply . " Did n't know I 'd been talkin ' to you . Thought I was speakin ' to me brother-in-law . " " Yes , " I said irritably , " but who is Gertie and why is she ? or it ? all right ? " " Gertie , sir , " replied the station in the North , " is me wife . ' Ad an operation this evenin ' . Come through it fine . " " I am delighted to hear it , " I said , and walked over to the Controller . " I am sorry , sir , " I said , " but it appears that the original message was not intended for us . " The Controller was human after all , even at 0400 . " No harm done , " he said , winking solemnly . " Good thing to keep everyone awake and on their toes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Britain 's North Sea approaches had been effectively protected by an invisible bastion of radar . But after war started , additional radar stations wi re rushed to completion in the South and West as new and improved equipment poured from secret factory production lines . These stations had to be tested and calibrated by flying aircraft on known courses in the neighborhood . Sometimes autogyros were used , since they could remain more or less stationary over fixed points while the scientists checked the radar instruments . Unfortunately , the scientists found church steeples most useful as fixed points . This practice led to the Regrettable Episode of the Vicar and the Autogyro . None of the British public knew even of the existence of radar in those days , and autogyros hovering for hours over steeples were bound to lead to some comment and misunderstanding . Even so , all might have been well if the scientists had been a little less preoccupied . The story is best told in the words of the official report , though nothing would induce me to reveal by whom the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . In the normal course of events it would have been lost forever in the files of Whitehall . But when , in 1940 , Britain gave the United States free access to her radar secrets , all files were thrown ' open to American scientists . It was one of them who dragged this report from merciful obscurity and republished it ? with an illustration ? in a restricted scientific paper . He is said to have done an to prove to his incredulous colleagues that the British have a sense of humor . That is how the lost report came to the United States and how I saw it again after many years . Now that there is nothing secret about it , I can quote it in full , merely deleting all clues to the identities of those concerned . REPORT : To Officer Commanding .. . 1 . In view or possible repercussions from the Church and the Press , you may wish to be advised of the regrettable and unusual results of an experiment conducted under the direction of the Research Staff . I. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertain them , are as follows . 3 . On Sunday morning , the Scientific Officer in charge of tests instructed the pilot of an autogyro to proceed to the village of and to hover over the church spire , which afforded an admirable fixed point for calibration purposes . 4 . It would appear that , in their concentration on this vital aspect of the national effort , all concerned had momentarily forgotten the day of the week and the fact that Matins would be in progress . 5 . In accordance with his instructions , therefore , the pilot brought his autogyro into position , at a low altitude over the spire , and hovered during the entire progress of the service , thereby , it is feared , making devotions difficult and the sermon inaudible . 6 . The pilot observed the congregation leaving the church and regarding the autogyro with expressions of annoyance and distaste , but continued hovering in accordance with instructions . 7 . Shortly afterwards he was startled by two loud explosions and , looking down to ascertain the cause , was surprised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shotgun with which , the pilot deduced , he had just attempted to secure a left and right at the autogyro . S. Considering that the interest of science would best be served by withdrawing from the danger area , before the Vicar had time to reload , the pilot returned to his base . 9 . The Scientific Officer , however , was of the opinion that he was fully justified in ordering the pilot to risk further salvos of ack-ack from the Vicar , in view of the urgent importance of completing calibration tests . He accordingly instructed the pilot to return and to continue hovering over the spire. 10 . The pilot , to whose intrepid sang-froid you may wish to draw the attention of the appropriate authorities , resumed his station over the spire during the late afternoon and evening , a period which unfortunately coincided with Evensong ? a fact which the Scientific Officer , doubtless by sheer inadvertence , had overlooked . 11 . No further ack-ack was encountered , but signs of alarm and despondency among the parishioners were not lacking , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them urgent instructions . 12 . There was much coming and going from the vicarage and the village . The pilot observed objects among the graves in the churchyard . Slightly reducing his altitude , he was able to identify these objects as bed linen , towels , sheets , pants , vests , nightshirts , and so forth . It is understood , however , that these articles were specifically brought from the vicarage and neighboring cottages and that any reports that may be received , to the effect that the parishioners were disrobing in the churchyard under the Vicar 's instructions , should be treated with reserve . 13 . Eventually , this assortment of linen and underclothes was seen to take the form of huge letters spread across the churchyard , which the pilot was able to identify without difficulty as a message clearly intended for himself . 14 . The message read : " In the name of God , go ! " 15 . In our view , the pilot was correct in interpreting this as a sign that his presence was unwelcome to the civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft to further ack-ack fire , he decided , no doubt wisely , to terminate the test and landed safely at his base . N. It is not unreasonable to anticipate the possibility of unfavorable criticism being directed against this branch of the Service through the usual channels , and you may wish to be apprised of the facts in order to consider appropriate action . ( signed ) DIRECTOR 5 FROM the Olympian heights of Whitehall , the finger of authority unaccountably reached down to a very low level and jerked me out of my duties just as I was beginning to learn the difference between a goniometer and a Group Captain . " You , " said authority , " will recruit radar personnel . We want as many as you can get . " Already , early in 1940 , British radar equipment was flowing from the factories in quantity . But trained men and women to operate and service it could not be produced so rapidly . Simply stated , the problem was to find in sufficient numbers people who did not exist , to undertake entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could not be mentioned . And for certain types of work , no one yet knew what civilian experience was the most useful . We went , first of all , after the radio " hams . " We snatched scientists from laboratories ; we wheedled service men from radio shops ; we scrutinized lists of radio societies . We interviewed university authorities . In the colleges and hotels of Oxford and Cambridge , I persuaded piling men to join the RAP at once without giving a hint of what it was about . Fortunately their enthusiasm to serve was as high as the information I could give was meager . Women , too , were wanted in large numbers to operate the secret equipment . They could not be told what they were expected to do . At times , we interviewed some eighty a day ? allowing threeminutes to size up each . Fortunately women officers took part . For only a woman 's intuition could tackle such a problem effectively . The word went round that we needed various types , Lawyers , journalists , mechanics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers , mathematicians , professors , and adventurers ? all passed through the office in a ceaseless stream . All had to be interviewed ? any of them might provide a type which was urgently wanted . With the fall of France , authority decided to evacuate certain departments from London . I appealed . " It 's hard enough finding people for secret duties at secret places , " I explained . " . f my office is to be moved to a secret building in a secret location and people can not find me without discovering the secret , things will become impossible . " Authority relented . But demands for personnel of various kinds increased . " I want a lot of new officers immediately , " came a peremptory demand one morning . " Get ' em at all costs . You know the type of work and must find the best civilian types . Must have ' ens in uniform within a week . " One of the Club 's incomparable cocktails ? of which I never remembered to ask the recipe before the building was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxi . " Drive me to the Stock Exchange , " I said with some misgiving . My uniform gained me immediate admission to the Secretary . " I want a lot of arbitrage men to join the RAE immediately , " I replied to his friendly inquiry . " It 's vitally urgent , but I can not tell you more than that . " For a moment he looked as startled as if I had asked um to list a flotation of Sixth Mortgage Debenture Consolidated Swindles . Then the tradition of the City of London ? not to be surprised at anything ? took hold and he reached quickly for the phone . " I do n't know how many are available , " he said , " but I will see what I can do for you . " The Stock Exchange rallied round with lightning speed . Within a week the required officers , with arbitrage or similar experience , ivere on their way . They were trained and fully experienced just in time for the Battle of Britain and did a wonderful job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what arbitrage is . Whatever it is , the RAP found that it could use that type of brain . I shall always be grateful to those men in the Stock Exchange . I wish I could give them more business .
