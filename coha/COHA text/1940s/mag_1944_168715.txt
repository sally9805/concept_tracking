Able , Rome-wise New York Timesman Herbert L. Matthews spent weeks digging out the facts in the strange and murky death of Mussolini 's son-in-law , flashy Count Galeazzo Ciano ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) . Last week Matthews cabled his findings from Rome . Their gist : <P> Under Fascism , money could buy almost anything , even a man 's life . Someone spent millions trying to save Ciano . He almost escaped death . But there was treachery within treachery and behind it the implacable figure of Benito Mussolini , who sealed his son-in-law 's fate . <P> All of the 19 Grand Councilors who voted to oust the Duce last July 24 were tried for their lives . But at the trial in Verona 's grim , massive Castel Vecchio , built in 1335 near Diocletian 's amphitheater , only six defendants were present . The others were in hiding . The judges were all Italians ; no Germans took part . Many believe that the judges had been told to go as far as they liked , since the Duce would suspend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to testify . He did not behave well . Ciano called it " absolutely absurd that we ... wanted to ruin the Duce , since we would be buried in the ruin . " But he admitted that after the Council meeting he had gone to Marshal Badoglio , asked for a passport for himself , his wife Edda and their children . Prince Otto von Bismarck , Counselor of the German Embassy and a close friend , promised to put a plane at Ciano 's disposal . Ciano was spirited into the plane , but it flew to Germany , not to Spain as he intended . Later Edda and the children escaped in a car to Switzerland , though police had blanket orders to take her dead or alive , orders that could not have been issued without the knowledge of her adoring father . <P> ' Mama , Mia . ' The prosecutor demanded the death penalty , exclaimed : " Thus I have thrown your heads down before Italian history and perhaps even my own , but it is well , provided that Italy live . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death ( one got 30 years ) . The condemned at first did not take the sentence seriously . Italians do not believe in executions , least of all for political reasons , and Ciano was , after all , Mussolini 's son-in-law and former Foreign Minister . But the priests came and the prisoners realized that they were to die . Ciano agreed to sign a petition to the Duce . A courier flew to Lake Garda , where Mussolini was staying . But that night he was not there , nor did he appear until late next morning , after the five had been executed . <P> Italians swear that Hitler , not Mussolini , ordered that the executions be filmed . <P> So that pictures could be made , the five were shot at 9 a.m. instead of at dawn . Ciano , the last to be executed , had collapsed during the night . He had to be dragged between two militiamen and placed astride a chair withhis back to the firing squad . The volunteer firing squad was nervous and shot badly , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
