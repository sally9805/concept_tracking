 | and looked up at him and there was a little blur in her mind about the doctor 's letter . It was a good letter , was n't it , and it was written on official stationery , and signed and sealed and delivered ? What else can a doctor 's letter be ? I did n't see the letter , ' the girl said . What . what was there about it ? ' Nothing , ' the man said . But I seriously questioned his judgment . If I were a doctor , I would n't send anybody to Idaho to get rid of a cough . I should have said stay out of the snow , not hunt it up . ' Oh , ' Mrs. Girard said , by all means . If there 's - one thing that complicates a cough , it 's wet feet . ' She had every intention of going on , but the man cut in to answer her . Anybody can say that , ' he said . It takes a man of science to prescribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her voice was quiet , but it was heard . I 'm very glad to hear it , ' the man said . Afterwards I remembered that The Magic Mountain was full of snow and the patients were always going out in it to have long philosophical conversations . It made me feel better about your doctor . ' The Magic Mountain , ' Mrs. Girard said . We were in Germany when it was published . ' Her head shook and her eyes got cloudy , reconstructing a period . Then she looked up at the man and spoke briskly . I remember the book very well . The characters kept dying , one after the other . ' Miss Logan 's doctor probably never read it , ' the man said .  | Miss Logan looked around the room again , waiting for a call , but everybody was busy . And Mrs. Girard 's memory was functioning well . Everybody coughing behind their doors , and one death after another , was n't it ? I think it was the most depressing book I ever read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth showed distaste . My husband adored it , ' she said . It 's a great book , ' the man said . Some day when I 've got a lot of time , I 'm going to read it in German . ' He stopped and thought . I guess I am , anyhow . ' He must have been older than fifty , but when he talked about long philosophical conversations and said he guessed he 'd have to read something in German sometime , he had the air of one who is young and unconvinced . Now that I think about it , ' he said , I 'm tired of having people tell me I have n't read anything because I read translations . I know as much about The Magic Mountain as anyone who ever read it in German . I 've got a private theory , ' he said direct to Mrs. Girard , letting her in on something , that the cult for originals is a form of National Socialism ? nothing impure , nothing adulterated , nothing translated . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil intellectual snobbery , and I 'm glad I thought of it . Now I do n't ever have to read The Magic Mountain in German . ' Janet Logan stopped looking around the room while he was talking . She heard what he said and made in.  | voluntary nervous faces against it , young and intransigent ; and finally she spoke up with a nice little flare . What do you read for ? ' she said , just to find out what 's said ? ' The man looked down at her , not quite sure he 'd understood her . Is there something else to read for ? ' he said . Of course . ' She did n't even bother , in such company , to explain or expand . She just dropped the phrase on the floor and looked haughty above it . There was a silence . Mrs. Girard had settled down nicely . Her eyes were cloudy and her feather hat moved almost unnoticeably , like a bird on a roost . It was up to the man to ask questions if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's said ? ' The girl narrowed her eyes a little . I used to , ' she said . I certainly used to read the Oz books to find out what was said . ' And now you 're too big for the Oz books . ' Yes . Now I 'm more interested in the way things are said . ' That 's what I thought , ' the man said . Nobody but an aesthete could have got into such bad shape as you were in last spring . ' Janet Logan dropped the haughtiness like a hot potato . The pupils of her eyes broadened out and then shrank to points as if someone had shot a searchlight into her face . But she composed herself and began to talk the kind of sense that the man and Mrs. Girard  | and almost anyone could take hold of . What a book says is important , but the way it is said is also important . A happy blend of form and meaning is finally what makes a good book , a good poem , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book ? ' the man said . The girl did n't answer right off . Maybe I should n't have asked , ' he said . She 's your boss , is n't she ? ' Yes , she is , ' Janet said , but even if I 'd never heard of her , I 'd still like her book . Do you ? ' The girl asked for it , and the man was going to give her an honest answer , but it could n't be given in a word , like yes , ' for example , or no . ' I 've read it , ' he said . She was kind enough to inscribe a copy and send it to me . ' That was no kind of an answer , and the next thing he said was n't either . Of course , I 'd have read it , ' he said , even if she had n't sent it to me . I like to keep some sort of line on what the university produces . And it 's hard to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the way of faculty publication . Are you getting tired ? ' he said to Mrs. Girard . Fascinating , ' she said . So much nicer than cocktail parties . ' The man put his hand in his coat pocket , then shifted his teacup to the other hand and tried the other pocket . Left my pipe in my office , ' he said , and Janet  | Logan went around behind him and got one of the packages of cigarettes and held it toward him . Thank you , ' he said . He took one and offered the pack to Janet , and held a match for both of them . I 'll tell you , ' he said . The university ca n't expect its faculty to produce things like novels or plays or poetry . Anyone who can write a play would rather be a playwright , in the first place . But there 's another side to it . Even if we could get writers , we would n't want the place cluttered up with a lot of people who are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong tendency to be . ' He pulled at the cigarette and did n't like it . He tossed it into the fireplace , and felt in his pockets again for his pipe . It 's hard to keep your mind clear about what a teacher ought to be , when you know so many teachers . ' He stopped and thought . This was his business , this thing of evaluating teachers , and he took it seriously . The question was still Miss Maury 's book , but it got off onto some complicated bypaths . My own idea , ' he said , is that teachers ought first of all to teach . But they 're also expected to write , and to publish , and that gets us into a lot of trouble . They do n't usually have anything special they want to write , and so they write scholarly articles ? notes to build up the possibility that the dark lady of the sonnets may really have been a blonde . ' He did n't think it was funny , either ; he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and I do n't know . I just do n't know . '  | Janet Logan looked at this man with something like warmth , now , and waited politely for anything he would say . There 's something better than that , ' he said . A book like Miss Maury 's comes out with a splash , and the weeklies review the worst parts of it for the wrong reasons , and the whole thing gives me the happy illusion that the university is a place where people write books to be read , not just pamphlets to be filed . ' He 'd got to it , now . The answer would be coming . Her book opened things up for me , ' he said . I read the chapter on Baudelaire 's method , and then the one on Rimbaud 's , and ' ? he turned his head to the side and tried to remember ? Who wrote the one about the dead men in the sea ? ' Valery , ' Janet said , fast , like a student who holds up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Valery , ' the man said . I read those three chapters and it was like having someone hand me the combination to a safe . I do n't think I 'd have bothered to read the poems at all , but I read the explanation to the cemetery one , and the explanation made it sound like an extraordinary poem . So then I read the poem , and then Miss Maury 's translation , and the words did n't seem to have much to do with the explanation , until I checked them all back and forth , poem , translation , explanation , and saw what she was doing . And after that I read poems and explanations the rest of the night . It was like getting hold of a good mystery novel . ' The girl made one of her faces , and the man saw it .  | I 'm sorry , ' he said . He turned to Mrs. Girard . Maybe we ought to go home . I have offended an aesthete . ' No , you have n't , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the young lady , ' Mrs. Girard saw some reason for saying , who proposed that I might sponsor some French films for the university . ' I only proposed it , ' Janet said . The idea was Miss Maury 's . ' She does n't run short of ideas , does she ? ' the man said . He looked at Janet . How long did it take her to write that book , do you know ? ' Two years , ' Janet said . Summers and nights and week-ends . ' She looked tired , just saying it . The man shook his head . It should have taken five years steady , just for the explanations alone . ' He stopped talking and put his hand up to his chin , and frowned . There 's one thing I wonder about it , ' he said . I 'll ask her some day when she 's not so busy . ' He seemed to be going to let it go at that , and then he turned directly to the girl and spoke his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of it ? ' The girl wrinkled her forehead and kept still . She ought to have stuck to the poems and steered clear of the lives , ' the man said . Why do you think that ? ' the girl said , very stern ; and the man looked suddenly weary , as if the job of explaining this to the girl was going to be both thankless and too hard .  | I do n't know what you mean , ' Janet said , and forced it on him . Very well , then . Here is a girl who says she does n't know what he means , and she probably does n't ; and so the man must put her straight , in the interest of what he considers truth . He took it slowly , laid it out carefully , with no heat and no rancor . He broke it down to elements and then used a method that was almost mathematical . Like this : Miss Maury , in making a series of brilliant analyses of some very complicated poems , starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds them to be decadent , disorderly , and , to the lay mind , evil . She then expends a good deal of loving care on this evil . She plays it up for as much as , or more than , it 's worth . This is what these men were , she says , they were drug addicts , and homosexuals , and sadists , to name a few of the things they were . In their lives they studied death . They deranged their senses to the edge of insanity ; and they came out ? great poets . But that 's the truth , ' the girl said . Her voice was level and she meant what she said . There seems to be a little difference of opinion here , ' the man said to Mrs. Girard , who was n't listening ; and he turned and gave the lie to the girl . No , it 's not true , ' he said , and a person of Miss Maury 's great critical powers should never have allowed herself to be taken in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl looked both puzzled and rebellious , and the man adopted once more the patient , pedagogical  | manner : here 's a thing that looks one way , and is another way . There should be some means of clearing it up . He tried again . The poets Miss Maury writes about were what she says , they had these troubles , or weaknesses , or sins , whatever you want to call them ; and they also wrote great poems . Now , the easy thing to say is that they wrote great poetry because they had these weaknesses or sins or whatever . ' He waited for the point to drive itself in , but the girl 's eyes remained shady and veiled . She was n't having any . It 's much too easy , ' the man said . We could make a grand tour of all the jails right now , and find a thousand drug addicts and homosexuals who never wrote a line of poetry in their lives and never will . It is n't because of those things that her poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' There it was , in a nutshell , and the girl thought about it , and looked a little surprised . It 's hard , having made up your mind about a thing , to start entertaining doubts , and she was n't prepared to start . You do n't like the book , ' she said . She was at once prim and sad about it , and then she seemed to realize , all by herself , that she must have sounded silly , and she blushed bright . Any discussion with any woman , ' Kennedy said , is likely to go this way . They can understand all praise , they can accept all blame , but they do dislike any sort of niggling ' discrimination , do n't they ? ' He looked very young again , and disarmingly pleasant .  | I do like the book , ' he said . I like it very much , and you ca n't tell me I do n't .

' He looked around the room , over the heads of the people , and spotted Pauline Maury , standing now , near the table , straight and slim and small . She was as much of a stand-out in this room as a foreign car in a street crowded with Chryslers and Fords . The Fords and the Chryslers may be better-looking , but there is always an air and a strangeness about a Mercedes that marks it out to be looked at and wondered at and admired . She talked to people as if she liked it , and when she smiled she opened her mouth and her teeth flashed . She had something the look of a child-wonder chess player answering one , then another , then another , of the ones around her , and then suddenly shifting her ground and making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one was yawning , no one looked worried , no one edged off . They listened , all of them , and they talked . They used language to express ideas , their own ideas , and other good ideas . The golden curtains were drawn across the glass wall , the lamps gave light , and civilization was in this room , drinking its tea . At a quarter to six there was a good deal of smoke in  | the room , and the groups had shifted , and three or four of the people had said their decent good-byes and gone home . The graduate students were close to the table , talking their highly specialized shoptalk ? why does the appropriations committee consistently neglect to appropriate a living wage for teaching-assistants , and who will receive the real plum of the French Department now that Professor Barzin has gone , at such long last , to his eternal reward , will it be Mademoiselle Maury , or will it be Monsieur Gordon , over the almost-dead bodies of their seniors ? Graduate students wonder these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ca n't see how they will ever make all the hurdles and become successful professors themselves , and around a quarter to six they are likely to come back to the table and try to work in some final concentrated eating , in the hope of flagging the evening meal . George , the Filipino , had gone , and MacKenzie , the helper , was standing beside the kitchen door doing more watching then helping . The graduate students did n't need help , and the others did n't look as if they needed anything to eat . Pauline Maury was talking French to her colleague , Mr. Gordon , who knew a great deal about French literature , but who was shaped wrong to speak French at all . He lectured in English , he concerned himself with literary history and criticism , and no one but Pauline Maury ever suggested that he speak French . But it almost always happened , when they were together , that she made a show of being clumsy in Eng-  | lish to make him clumsy in French . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kindness , a little job of free tutoring to give him practice in the language , or was it only woman 's need to put man in an unbecoming position ? Whatever it was , she poured French at him , a flow of it , and he answered correctly , marking the accents as he went . Why is your charming wife not here ? ' she said . She is missed . ' My charming wife is not here because she is at home nursing our charming baby . It is what one calls the six-o'clock feeding . ' Of course , of course . I had forgotten . And that makes how many children ? ' Pauline Maury asked , alive with interest . John Gordon scowled and spoke sternly . That makes one , un , un seul enfant , ' and Pauline Maury looked at him delighted , and laughed , a note as clear and open as a bird in a field . Poor John , ' she said .

He lives down the street here in the next block below me . ' Parke ? I do n't know him . ' Ah , ' Pauline Maury said . There is an enormous fertility in the house of Professor Parke . And you with your unique baby girl . ' Gordon smiled , all soft at the very thought of his baby girl .  | I am knitting a thing for her , ' Pauline Maury said , in a lowered voice , but please do n't mention it to your wife until I see how it comes off . It is in a crucial stage at the moment ; I am purling some knits around the bottom , and what a tedium ! ' You do n't have to make yourself purl knits just because I have a baby , ' Gordon said , and Pauline Maury looked slightly hurt . I do it because I want to , because there never in the world was such a pink curly baby girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she raised her head her eyelashes clung together and made points like stars . Gordon saw how it was with her , and he began to talk English and tell her about the disadvantages of babies , how they disrupt orderly procedures on the one hand , and make a man a slave to a schedule on the other hand . A baby is the greatest known foe to leisure , never deceive yourself about it . But that is the mother 's part , is n't it ? ' Pauline Maury said . The sire only comes in to play with the baby before dinner , or to watch it while it sleeps . ' No , ' Gordon said . The sire comes in for a lot of things he never knew about . ' And he was forced to say that from the moment that little baby girl was born , she had systematically prevented him from doing anything he did n't absolutely have to do .

She said it as simply as one would say Chase yourself , ' and the man , this John Gordon , this new father , looked weighted . It must be nice to have a book written and off your chest , and stand around and talk to people the way you do , ' he said ; and Pauline Maury looked at him and said , I should have thought it would be nice to have a baby . Do you want everything ? ' No , not everything . He only wanted to have the baby and to be able to support it , and hang on to his sanity , and teach his classes , just these few things .

Worse than that , you lose the vision , you do n't remember whether the book 's any good or not . Did that happen to you ? ' he said , a little hopefully . To me ? ' Pauline Maury said . But to begin with I have no baby , nor the equivalent of a wife , and I have no Michigan . And I have something else very good :  | I ca n't sleep at night .

He was tall and too thin , and he wore flannel trousers and a tweed coat , and a pullover sweater instead of a vest . If he had been in a different situation , casting a line onto a pool , or sitting on a rock enjoying the sun , he would have been handsome , but as it was , here in this apartment with six o'clock pushing at him , his eyes were pink and his face was yellow and there was a vein that jumped in his neck . Did you learn not to sleep ? ' he said . It was an unwilling question .

' She was bound to tell him these things , and she stood there as fresh and as natural as a fern in a wet meadow , telling him . Her eyes were small and black , her lashes were short and clung in points . She did n't need sleep . Nobody ever looked more alert , or sharper eyed , or better put together . She had on a black dress . There was a narrow white-beaded collar at the neck , and a flat close belt at the waist , and a whirl at the knees . Nothing out of France so French as this black thing of a dress .  | She told him things she had found out . Daylight is only to make it easy to move around .

Push the pages away from you , stand up , turn out the lamp , and feel the gray move in . Make your legs take you to the window , and stand there and look out over the roofs of the town . Remove the roofs and see all the yawning in the beds , and the flipping back and forth , resisting the day without having known the night .

No disturbance whatever and you will have a new look at everything . ' Gordon shook his head . Thanks , ' he said , but I do n't think you can fix me up . I do n't want to work , what I want to do is sleep . ' He was twisting an empty sherry glass in his hand , and she took it away from him and filled it from the decanter on the table .

She opened a low cupboard , and MacKenzie watched her , and she stopped and looked up at him without much patience .  | Please go back and pass toast , ' she said , and he left . She stood up . She had a brandy bottle in her hand and she reached up to the cupboard for a glass . Janet Logan had her back turned to her .

You 'd better go back , I guess , ' she said to Pauline Maury . You 're giving a party . I forgot about that . ' If something is wrong , I 'd prefer to know about it . ' All right , ' Janet said .

Too cold , too much snow . Altitude , ' Pauline Maury said . It 's good to go to a high place . You should have said that . ' I did say that , I think , ' the girl said . At least someone said something that got them away from it . Mrs. Girard started talking about The Magic Mountain , that was what it was , and after that it was better for a while .

But when Janet got the fumes of the brandy , she took the glass into her own hand and drank it . Whew ! ' she said when the heat hit her . Pauline Maury 's voice was going now , very kind and calm , telling her not to be an idiot , not to be frightened , who in the world would care whether she were in Larchmont for a rest , or in Idaho for a rest , what difference could it possibly make to a man like Kennedy , who had problems of his own ?

You allow yourself to go to pieces for nothing , do you know that ? ' This was something , I think , ' Janet said , and she began to twist the glass again . Pauline Maury showed the first signs of irritation . There was a party going on , in fact almost over , and the hostess was having to spend too much time in the kitchen . She began again with more authority than she 'd allowed herself before . In what you have told me , ' she said , there is nothing to think twice about . Tell me , did Mr. Kennedy actually say at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Janet tried to remember . No , ' she said . Not quite that way . ' Good , ' Pauline Maury said . Everything is all right . I feel certain of it . He ca n't have anything in his mind against you . ' Yes , he can , ' Janet said . There was something about the way he looked at me , and the way he said things . ' Pauline Maury laughed , and her teeth flashed whiter than the tile . Foolish , ' she said . Was anyone ever so foolish to  | such a foolish degree ? You believe that all the world looks at you in a certain way , and says things to you with double-entendre intentions , because a year ago you spent two weeks in Larchmont . Shall I tell you again that there is no disgrace in that ? It was an illness like a cough , no worse , and you got rid of it like a cough . ' I know . I know that . ' And you are well now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Then it 's finished , is n't it ? No one frightens you . ' It was like a simple declaration of faith , with the statements leading the responses , and the whole thing performed from the mouth out and avoiding the corrosion of thought . It 's no disgrace . I know , it 's no disgrace . You are well now . I know ; I 'm well now . No one frightens you . I know . No , ' the girl said . No one frightens me , but in there , with him shoving questions at me , I think I made a bad showing . J think I made a fool of myself . ' Pauline Maury shot the question with her eyebrows . He knows all about Idaho , ' Janet said . He goes there fishing and he wanted to talk about it . ' You should have let him talk . ' I did . But he wanted me to talk about it too , and when he asked me where I stayed , this thing happened , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Larchmont . ' You did n't say it , did you ? ' No . ' You 're sure ? '  | Yes , I 'm sure . ' What did you say ? Did you run away without saying anything ? ' This got a response . Janet looked up , narrowed her eyes , and smiled a short , bitter smile . No , I said I had n't had any tea , and I left to get some . ' Pauline Maury turned her back and pushed the kitchen door open and took a short look into the living room , and then turned back to Janet . I 'm going in now , ' she said . I want you to wait here for a minute and then come in and get yourself a cup of tea and stay away from John Kennedy . Talk to the young ones , and do n't worry . ' She turned away again and at the door she stopped and looked back and made a little face , very French : . And when they 've all gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me at length what makes you such an idiot . ' Did n't I ever explain that ? ' the girl said , and Pauline Maury heard the tone of it , the small rise in spirits , the quick attempt to get back to firm ground , and she pushed open the kitchen door and left , satisfied . The door swung back , and Janet Logan faced a blank . The glass in her hand was crystal with a plain , heavy base , badly fingermarked from the mauling it had just taken , and she looked at it , disgusted , and set it down . The human hand can make a mess of anything . She held her hands in front of her and looked  | at them , and opened and closed them . They were clammy like toadstools , and she turned on the hotwater tap and went to work on them . She got a cake of soap and washed and rinsed and washed and rinsed , like a surgeon removing germs . When she had enough , she jerked a paper towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she saw the glass again and picked it up and washed it . The human hand can make a mess of anything , but it can also be diligent like a beaver to clean things up . When the glass was washed , she got a clean towel , coarse linen , pure white , and dried it , and held it up to the light and polished it . And all the time her lips moved , repeating a charm that never ended : Now I lay me down to sleep , now I lay me down to sleep , now I lay me down to sleep , now I lay me down . She did n't know she said it , but she kept it up , and it never got into anything more adult or complicated like Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now , and at the hour of our death , or Heavenly Father , thy will be done . This was not a matter of a will being done , but of gentle , humble , repetitive supplication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me lay me down . She hung up the towel , and stood with her hands clean and dry , and repeated the charm while she looked at her watch , six-seventeen , and at the clock on the oven , six-fourteen , and at the crystal glass , untouched , unmarked , and empty , on the shelf . The brandy bottle stood beside it , and she picked it up , poured two fingers into the glass , took a deep breath , and drank it . Now I lay me down to sleep , ' she said , a little faster while the  | warmth was spreading and settling ; and when it had settled , she put the glass down , and squared her shoulders . She walked up to the door , and touched it , and stood there with her hand on it , but not pushing . She . dropped her hand , and backed away a couple of steps , and looked hard at the door . Oh , very well , ' she said , and she pushed it open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly at anything , but she got a clear enough sense of the way things were lined up , the moment she was inside , and a sharp knowledge of who was where . There were fewer people now , there were almost no people , and no chance to be lost in a crowd . The tea table was abandoned . The graduate students had gone home , and she had it , as it was , to herself . She found a clean cup and saucer and tilted the teapot , full tilt , and took what there was , a quartercupful of cool tea leaves . She made herself busy with it , adding things . She added water and lemon and cream and sugar , and that was all there was to add . The group beside the fireplace , the one to stay away from , looked happy . John Kennedy was talking and his voice rang out , nothing ominous , telling something ; and the rest of them , John Gordon , Pauline Maury , Mrs. Girard , and a boy in a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The helper was neither hanging back nor pushing forward , and he seemed as natural a part of the group , white coat notwithstanding , as any of the rest of them . He stood between Kennedy and John Gordon , and he bore himself well , with the ease of a man who has neither to  | worry about faculty publication nor to lecture twice on Friday . Nothing weighed on him , and he looked it . He could come to this tea in one capacity and enjoy it in another . It began to be a question in the mind of the girl whether he would n't simply say thank you and good-bye to the hostess , and leave without washing the dishes , he had such an air of freedom . Besides the ones at the fireplace the only others were a man and woman , young and deep in a conversation , which Janet Logan must immediately go and demand a part of , rather than look footloose . She took her cup with all the things in it and went toward them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only effect her coming had was to remind them that it was time to leave . The stores will all be closed , ' the woman said , and Janet told her the one at the foot of the hill , the University Provision Company , stayed open until ten thirty . Good , I 'll stop there , ' the woman said . Let 's see , I had some gloves and a bag . ' I 'll go with you , ' Janet said , and she led the woman to the bedroom and found the purse and gloves , lying on the bed , alone , the last ones there . She handed them to the woman , and the woman took them and looked around the room . Nice place , ' she said . She stopped being busy and let herself look carefully at everything , at the gold willow bed with the white satin spread , and at the gold-lacquered , kidney-shaped desk , the kind of desk at which Madame de Sevigne herself might have sat  | down happily and written a long letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix her slipper , and the books on the night stand ; and when she saw how Janet stood there watching the way she took things in , she smiled a nice , open smile , and said , It looks the way a Frenchwoman 's bedroom ought to look , does n't it ? ' and Janet took a look around , herself , and said , Yes , I guess it does . ' The woman turned toward the study door , and Janet put her straight . The bathroom 's over there , ' she said , and the woman thanked her and went inside and closed the door , and left Janet standing in the middle of the room holding a cup of tea , looking around the room , trying to perform the mental exercise of seeing it for the first time . When I first saw this room , did it occur to me to think it looked the way a Frenchwoman 's bedroom ought to look ? How can I remember a thing like that , when I do n't remember first having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman had looked at , the bed , the desk , the ballet girl , and when her eyes came away from the ballet girl she saw the riding crop lying on the floor beneath it , and she went over and picked it up . She was standing with the teacup in one hand , and the riding crop in the other , when the Frenchwoman herself came in . My God , darling , ' she said , what in the world ... ? ' Janet motioned toward the bathroom . I 'm seeing someone off , ' she said . She set the teacup on the dressing table and stuck the riding crop behind the picture frame .  | It 's Miss Hawley , ' Pauline said , nodding toward the bathroom . She went to the desk and began moving things around . Do you know where the keys to the car can have got to ? ' she said . She moved more and more things , and then looked in the desk drawer ; and Janet went to the closet and found the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed them out . Thanks , ' Pauline said . I 'm going to drive Mrs. Girard home ; she was trying to get a taxi , and I may as well take her . It wo n't take long . ' Did you fix it ? ' the girl said . Fix what ? ' Pauline said . Kennedy . ' Pauline Maury was putting on a coat , and she stopped and laughed . But there was n't anything to fix . He thinks you 're wonderful . Help me with this , will you ? ' Janet held the coat for her , and before she could say anything else the woman came out of the bathroom , putting her gloves on , and began telling Pauline Maury that she had enjoyed the party so much , such an unusual apartment , and Pauline Maury began to be the hostess and tell the guest that she must not leave simply because she was putting on a coat , that it was only a matter of her taking Mme. Girard home , poor old thing , and she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no signal for departure at all . Not at all . Janet would be here in any case , until she got back . The two of them , Pauline and Miss Hawley , were leaving , saying these things , these generalized amenities ; and Janet stayed where she was , anonymous ,  | taking no part . And then suddenly Pauline was in again . You must come and say good night to Mr. Kennedy and Mrs. Girard , ' she said , and she linked her arm in Janet 's and began walking her out . Why ? ' Janet said . Because he thinks you 're wonderful , ' she said very quietly , and then they were at the door , the two of them , arm in arm . The door was open and Miss Hawley and Mr. Hackett and Mr. Gordon were on their way out , going down the hall , and Mrs. Girard and Mr. Kennedy and the helper were standing by the door , Mrs. Girard protesting that a taxi is the easiest way home , and being suavely and surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in her hand . Good night , young lady , ' Mrs. Girard said , and she and Janet shook hands . Come to see me again . It does n't have to be about the films . Just come . ' I shall , ' Janet said . Thank you . ' And then it was Kennedy shaking her hand and telling her he 'd enjoyed talking to her , and good night , and maybe there 'd be another chance sometime for him to hear her go to bat for art 's sake . Is that what I did ? ' Janet said . That 's what you did , ' he said , and they shook hands again , and then he turned to the helper , who was standing a little behind her . Good night , Ray , ' he said . I 'll call you next week , ' and then they left ? Mrs. Girard , and John Kennedy , and Pauline Maury.  | The voices and the footsteps went off down the hall and turned the corner and died , and Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucers and mussed-up napkins . The room looked large , now , with no one in it . There was a feeling of space about it , like a room in an art gallery when it has been cleared for the night . Janet picked up two cups from the mantel and carried them to the table . The helper stood filling his pipe , looking at a picture , the only picture in the room . It was large and alarmingly abstract , framed in a blond scalloped frame and hung on the wall directly opposite the glass wall . The helper looked at it closely , and then moved back and looked at it . Who painted this ? ' he said , and he turned around to see where the girl was , and saw her crouched down by the door making soft noises to lure the cat . Puss , puss , puss . Puss puss puss . ' I should think you 'd had enough of that cat for today , ' the helper said . Janet looked back over her shoulder . I have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night , just because I 'm mad at him . Puss , puss , puss . ' She stayed where she was and the helper got back to an inch-by-inch appraisal of the picture . Who painted this ? ' he said again , not looking around . He was looking at the signature , but he could n't be sure it was n't part of the picture . Paul d'Entremont , ' the girl said . He is n't known . ' Why should he be ? Are all his pictures like this one ? '  | More or less , the ones I 've seen . Puss , puss , puss . Why , what 's wrong with it ? ' This ? ' the boy said . It 's no good . ' Janet stood up and turned around . What do you want ? ' she said . A Saint Bernard hauling a little girl out of the ocean ? ' The helper turned around too and tightened his mouth a little . Yeah , ' he said , but how 'd you know ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on looking at the picture , and his silence imposed itself more than speech , because there was something in the angle of his head that made him look like an expert looking at a picture . But Janet did n't beg his pardon about the Saint Bernard , and he did n't say anything more about the picture . He only shook his head and turned his back on it , and saw the girl crouching at the door again , imploring the cat , and not getting anywhere . What do you want him for ? ' the helper said . I want him , because he 's got to come in , ' she said . He 's got to be having his supper . ' The boy wrinkled his forehead . He 's got to be having his supper ? ' Yes , ' Janet said . By the time Pauline gets back he must be in here where he belongs , or it will look as if ... She pushed her hair back , and addressed the cat again , this time in French , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice into an almost perfect reproduction of Pauline Maury 's and  | rolled French out at the cat , a fluid line of endearments and diminutives . And all for nothing . The helper watched with great interest , and some puzzlement . Look , ' he said finally , why do n't you just go out and get him by the tail and bring him in ? ' Do you know what could happen ? ' Janet said . If I took one step outside this door to get him , he could jump across to the neighbors ' flower-box and run away . ' It was in her voice that this would be a very bad thing to have happen . Can you see him ? ' the boy said . No . But he was underneath the swing awhile ago . ' How do you know he has n't run away already ? ' The girl jumped up and turned around fast , with her eyes wide . Is it true ? ' she said . Do you know that ? ' The helper was n't expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly idle piece of conjecturing about a cat , and he set about to lay everything straight . He did n't know whether the cat had run away or not , he did n't know anything , he was merely suggesting that if the cat did n't come in when called so nicely in French , it might be because he had n't heard the nice French . He might not have heard it , because he might not have been there ; that 's all he meant to say . All right , ' Janet said , and she dumped the problem on the helper , but what am I going to do ? ' Why do anything ? ' the helper said . I have to get him back . '  | He 'll come back when he gets hungry , wo n't he ? ' r The helper was n't helping , was n't even trying ; and it was clearly up to the girl to figure the problem out for herself . She crouched down again at the edge of the darkness , looked out into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Dear , darling Arthur , come in here . ' As she said it the door across the room opened and Pauline Maury came in , hurrying and opening her purse . The helper turned as she entered , picked up a napkin and a cup and carried them to the table . The woman did n't look at him . She was n't bothering with student employment at the moment ; she was in a hurry , and what she wanted in her purse she could n't find . Janet turned when she heard her . I 'm glad you 're back , ' she said . I ca n't make Arthur come in . ' Suddenly there was no more hurrying . The woman stopped still , took her hand out of her purse , and raised her head . She looked straight at Janet , and her voice when she spoke was slow and cold . What have you done to him ? ' Everything was quiet . Pauline stood where she was , and looked at Janet , and there was no need to repeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy all over the room . The girl stood up and faced her . I have n't done anything to him , ' she said . Then why does n't he want to come in ? ' I do n't know . I do n't have any idea . He just won't. '  | Pauline Maury looked past Janet and out the open door . Will you please tell me why he was outside ? ' The girl spoke up a little better to this . I do n't know , ' she said . He goes where he pleases , does n't he ? ' The helper was busy at the table , taking off all the cups and saucers , and dumping all the slices of lemon out of the cups , and then stacking the saucers , and piling the cups together in nests of three . He kept himself busy , and he did n't leave the room . Janet looked at Pauline Maury . If you 'll call him , ' she said , he 'll come in . He always comes for you . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then answered the question herself . No , never for you . I wonder why he does n't like you ? ' There had been a kind of suspension of motion while they talked , the girl standing a little limp beside the open glass door , and the woman facing her , very straight and intent . They made almost a tableau ; but Pauline Maury broke out of it as suddenly as she had gone into it , and picked up a good deal of animation , and resumed the search in her purse . I must go immediately , ' she said . Mrs. Girard is waiting . ' I thought you took her home , ' Janet said . I wish I had , ' she said . Where is the sacred key in all this mess ? ' She went to the table and put her purse on it and began to strip off her right glove . My hands have no sensitivity to keys , ' she said .  | With gloves , one thing feels like another . ' And she continued the search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to ask me to have supper with her , and of course I must do it. , She looked up at Janet . You understand that , do n't you , that I must go with her whether I like it or not . One owes it to her . ' Janet was looking out the door and did n't answer . Pauline brought a small key out of her purse with a considerable air of accomplishment . Voila , ' she said . She stood up and walked to Janet . I The helper had done all he could about stacking things , and he was going around the room picking up napkins . He was all the way across the room now , and Pauline held the little key between her thumb and finger and came and stood beside Janet at the door . I 'm very sorry , ' she said . Do you know that I am sorry ? ' Janet did n't look at her . It does n't matter , ' she said . Only get him in here , will you , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night ? ' Pauline laughed . Foolish , ' she said . You will never understand cats . The first thing to know about cats is that they will do as they please . ' Fine , ' Janet said . It 's all right with me . But why do you ' Pauline broke in on her . It 's completely indifferent to me , wholly unimportant , ' she said . We 'll talk about it later . ' No , ' Janet said . I think I 'd rather talk about it now . '  | Pauline looked at the key . Darling , I 've got to go . I only came back to tell you I got myself into this bore of a business with Mme. Girard , and to bring you the key to the medicine chest . ' I do n't need anything , ' Janet said . I 'll work a little while and go to bed . ' No , Pauline Maury said . Very wrong . Work was not the thing . Work was what is called contraindicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you had work to do , you must do work . Work was indicated . But not tonight , no work tonight , ' Pauline Maury said . I was badly worried about you this afternoon ; did I show it ? ' No , but I suppose I did . ' Nothing to concern yourself about , ' Pauline Maury said . You did very well . Anyone who did n't know you , would , I imagine , have thought you acted perfectly . But tome ... I may as well say it , I was badly frightened . You were beginning to look the way you did the other time . ' Janet turned suddenly and walked away . She went to a table beside the fireplace and got herself a cigarette and came back banging it into the palm of her hand . What do you expect ? ' she said , a little unevenly , when someone gets me in a corner and tries to make a case-history of me ? ' Pauline Maury moved her head very slightly in the direction of the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to go this minute , ' Pauline Maury said .  | She started toward the bedroom , moving swiftly , her ankles slim and unwavering , her shoes narrow and exceptional and extravagant . I 'll have to have a hat . I gave that as my reason for coming back . ' She went into the bedroom and left the door open , and then there were sounds of other doors and drawers being opened . Janet crossed the room and dropped herself into a chair , tired and sprawling . She still had the cigarette in her hand and she looked at it , recognized it , put it in her mouth , and began to feel around for a match . When it became clear that there were no matches within reach , the helper was standing beside her holding one for her . She lighted her cigarette , and he blew out the match , closed the cover on the card , and handed it to her . Why do n't you just keep those ? ' he said , and then you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took them and put them in the pocket of her sweater . Thank you very much . ' It 's a pleasure , ' MacKenzie said . I did n't hear what you said , ' Pauline Maury said , from the bedroom . Nothing , ' Janet called back . I 'm sorry , ' the voice from the bedroom said , but I 'm doing so many things . ' Do you want me to help you ? ' Pauline Maury came into the room carrying a number of things , including a glass of water . She set the glass on the table beside Janet and dropped two small yellow capsules beside it . Then she went and stood in  | front of the mirror by the door and began to wind a bright blue turban around her head . She had a pearl pin in her mouth , and she did n't try to talk until she had bound the turban tight around her head , knotted it in front , and stuck the pin in it . It was a handsome hat , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take both of those , ' Pauline Maury said , when she turned away from the mirror , and go right to bed . ' Janet looked up at her . I 've got papers to correct , ' she said . Not tonight , ' Pauline said . I absolutely forbid it . ' You give me a job , and then absolutely forbid me to work at it . ' Jan , ' Pauline said , please do n't be difficult . I 'm worried about you . I do n't want to leave you . I do n't want to leave you at all ; but I must . Do you understand that ? ' Of course . Did I say anything about your not leaving ? ' No , no , but I feel sorry about it . ' She stopped , and took a quick look at the helper . He had the big silver tray in his hands and was moving toward the kitchen with it , and the woman lowered her voice and spoke deliberately , not in so much of a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could n't have gone out tonight in any case . It would n't have been the thing for you , and I gave up the idea when I saw how badly upset you were . The only thing for you to do now is to rest , as the doctor said , rest completely , and  | do n't allow anything to make you become agitated or give you any anxiety . I want you to take two capsules and sleep deeply until tomorrow . ' Janet looked sidewise at the capsules . Two of those would put me out for sixteen hours , ' she said . Nonsense . One of them loses its effect in two hours , two of them would be effective for four hours at the most . After that the sleep is completely normal . ' The time you gave me three , I rolled around in clouds for two days . ' I completely fail to see why you should adopt a moralistic attitude toward a medicinal prescription . ' Is that what I adopt ? ' Mrs. Girard will think I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . It 's important . ' She picked up the capsules and the glass of water and held them out toward the girl . All right , ' Janet said . I 'll take them . But I want to be ready to go to bed before I do . ' Are n't you ready now ? ' No . I take off my clothes , and brush my teeth , and take a bath , and open the window . ' You took a bath this afternoon . How many baths a day do you take ? ' All right , but I still have to brush my teeth and open the window . ' Pauline Maury smiled and set the glass and the capsules back on the table . You 're better , ' she said . She started toward the door . I 'll be back as soon as I can possibly manage , and I do not expect you to know when I come in , be-  | cause I expect you to be sleeping like the ... like the what ? Like the just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Very well , ' Janet said , that 's the way I 'll try to be sleeping . Just like the just . You 'll know it when you see it . ' Pauline Maury turned back once more . Jan , ' she said . Janet , have you been drinking ? ' The girl looked up very sharply , and threw her cigarette into the fireplace . I asked if you 'd been drinking. ! ' You gave me one , ' she said , and I took another one , if that 's what you want to know . Is there something wrong with that ? ' Do n't be angry , please . Of course there 's nothing wrong with that . It 's only that there was something strange about the way you looked , just now , just as I turned away . ' If I look strange I ca n't help it . ' The bell rang beside the door . Oh God , o bon Dieu , ' Pauline said . Now Madame Girard is stirred up . I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call down the grill that I was detained and that I am now on my way down ? ' Janet got up and went to the speaking-grill beside the door , and put her mouth close to it , and said what she should say ? that Miss Maury had been detained by a telephone call ? and Pauline started down the hall and came back while she was still talking . She had a five-dollar bill in her hand , and she pushed it at Janet and whispered , Pay the boy , will you , it 's  | fifty cents an hour , ' and Janet took the bill and repeated at the same time to Mrs. Girard , who had trouble understanding , that Miss Maury had been detained by a telephone call , and should be down by now , or very shortly , and that she had very much regretted being held so long at the telephone ; and Pauline Maury whispered again , Good night , Jan .

The two yellow capsules were side by side on the table , and she picked them up and rattled them together like dice in her hand , and sat down again and hung one leg over the arm of the chair . No more people , no dean , sponsor , hostess ; all that was left of the party had been stacked and taken to the kitchen , and Janet Logan lay back in , the chair , clicking in her hand the two yellow capsules that would obliterate all that remained of this Thursday . She dropped them back on the table and looked carefully at the face on the five-dollar bill . It was the face of Mr. Lincoln , the Great Emancipator , and she looked at it while she did a simple arithmetical problem : if the helper had arrived at two o'clock , as he was supposed to , and it was now seven o'clock , as the watch on her wrist indicated , that made five hours ; and five hours at fifty cents an hour makes two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . The helper was now two dollars and a half into the bill , and if it took him another hour she could exchange the five for two .  | Ray MacKenzie came in from the kitchen holding a big bunch of teaspoons in a dish-towel . He took them , one by one , from the bunch , dried them on another part of the towel , and set them in a row on the big table . The girl did n't turn around , and he stood looking at the back of her chair while he dried the silver . How old is this place ? ' he said after a while . Janet looked around the edge of the chair . It was finished a year and a half or so ago , ' she said . Has she lived in it all that time ? ' he said , and moved his head toward the door , apparently to indicate that he meant Miss Maury . Yes , ' Janet said . Does she like it ? ' I suppose so . She does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I what ? ' Like it . ' I do n't know , ' Janet said . No , not very much . ' I do n't either , ' the boy said . It looks sort of like the bridal suite on a luxury liner . ' I would n't know , ' the girl said . I never was in one . I never was on one . ' Where do these go , do you know ? ' MacKenzie said . Leave them there ; George can put them away in the morning . ' How much of a cook is he ? ' Good . ' That 's what he told me , ' MacKenzie said . He went back to the kitchen , and Janet , left by herself ,  | got up and began to walk around the room to see what the bridal suite on a luxury liner might look like . She emptied all the ashtrays into the fireplace , while she was about it , and took them out to the kitchen to be washed . They do n't call them bridal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . No , ' MacKenzie said , but that 's mostly what they use them for . ' He had the dishes stacked nicely , and suds in one side of the sink , and hot water in the other , and a dish drainer set up on the tile ; and he worked methodically and quickly . Pardon me , ' Janet said , could I get the stool ? ' and MacKenzie moved aside while she pulled the stool out from under the sink , set it by the door , and sat down on it . What do you think is wrong with the picture ? ' she said . What picture ? Oh , the one in there ? ' Janet nodded . I 'd have to look at it again , ' MacKenzie said , but the way I remember it , it looked disorganized and disorderly , and ... ' He stopped . I do n't know , ' he said . It looked as if the man that painted it meant it to be exciting . ' What 's wrong with that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have wanted to paint a picture , and if it turned out to be exciting that would have been different . ' He shook the suds off his hands , and turned around to talk .  | ' If you start out with the idea that you 're going to paint a picture to knock somebody 's eye out , it wo n't work out that way very often . ' Are you a painter ? ' Me ? ' MacKenzie said . No . ' He got back to the dishes . I 'm a pearl-diver , ' he said . What are you ? ' I can dry them , ' the girl said , and she got off the stool and took a dish-towel off the rack . Huh-uh , ' MacKenzie said . I do this . It 's my profession . ' That 's all right , ' Janet said . I 'd rather stay here than go somewhere else . ' MacKenzie took the towel away from her . Sit down , ' he said . You can stay . You do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his side of the sink , and went ahead with the washing . Janet sat on the stool . She started , two or three times , to say something , but in the end it was the helper who spoke first . How was it ? ' he said . Did you have a good time ? ' No , ' Janet said . I did n't think you did , ' MacKenzie said . You 've got a face like a seismograph , do you know it ? If somebody says something you do n't like , you make a face ; if you 're bored , your eyes wander ; if you 're interested , something tightens up in here . ' He took one hand out of the water and touched his cheekbones . How is it now ? ' the girl said , and he took a look . Nothing , ' he said . Tired . ' Would you say drunk ? ' the girl said , and he looked at her again .  | No , ' he said . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Janet said . I was just trying to find out how accurate you are . ' He did n't reply to that , and after a while Janet said , What about you ? Did you have a good time ? ' Yes , ' MacKenzie said . I liked the way it looked . ' I do n't believe I noticed how it looked . ' No , the boy said , it 's never easy to make out the lines of a forest when you 've got a tree in your face , but he was n't in that position , fortunately , and he 'd had a good view of the whole performance . He was very much interested in the way things look , you might say it was his business , and it was too bad directors could n't get scenes to look the way that one looked in there . It was something to think about , the way the light hit the faces , and the way people assumed and held attitudes that ticked them off , one after the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting the wineglass ; and the old lady with the shaky head coming up to the end of her term ; and Kennedy , the man of importance , speaking out ; and the girl , listening to him and scowling and shoving her hair back . It had the great quality . It was a minor revelation , the way any good scene should be . Janet heard him out , and thought about it , and then she said , Someone called me an aesthete this afternoon , but I ca n't touch that . ' I 'm no aesthete , ' the boy said . I 'm interested in show business . ' If you get into the habit , MacKenzie said , somewhat apologetically , of seeing things in terms of light  | and arrangement and gesture , you ca n't see them in any other terms . And it turns out to be a great pleasure to see a group of people looking typical without trying to , like the people at the party this afternoon . When everything comes together like that , it gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gave me one too . ' She had her chance now , and she asked the question she wanted to ask : How well do you know Mr. Ken-nedy ? ' He 's a friend of my father 's , ' the boy said . Does that make him a friend of yours ? ' Yes , ' he said . It 's because of him I 'm here . ' He looked at her , and she had her interested look ? a peculiar tension between her cheekbones and the corners of her eyes ? so he told her how it was . Kennedy and MacKenzie 's father went through school and college together , and MacKenzie 's father stayed in the East and became a preacher , and Kennedy came West to teach . And he , the helper , went to the same school , but declined to go to the same college . Not only declined , but refused . That college or any other college . He had , as it happened , other plans . And his father did n't care for the plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And your father 's good friend found you and put you in the university . ' No . It did n't happen that way . He did n't see Kennedy or look him up until he 'd been out here almost a year . He did n't even think about it until he got thrown in jail in Richmond along with a couple of  | men who owned a Tango game . He spent two nights in jail with his head itching before he remembered Kennedy . And then he got hold of him and Kennedy came right over and fixed it up and got him out . It was unfortunate about the Tango game . It was n't the job of his choice , in the first place . He had a good job when he first got out here , assistant director and handy man with an experimental theater in San Francisco . But the experiments all failed , and he wanted to stay close to the world of entertainment in one way or another , so he went to work calling numbers at the Tango parlor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Janet said . It made more money than it was supposed to make , ' MacKenzie said . So he got you out of jail , and put you in school . ' No . All he did was get me out . After that I got a job on a lumber boat and went to Mexico . ' Potato cook , ' the girl said . I beg your pardon ? ' George said you were a potato cook on a boat . ' He got it wrong , ' MacKenzie said . I was n't a potato cook , I was potato peeler to a sea-cook . And except for that it was a good trip . ' Where 'd you go ? ' Through the canal to Yucat4n , and two weeks loading , and back . ' Janet Logan shook her head and sighed deeply . There is something soothing in the thought of foreign ports . I 'm going back this summer , ' MacKenzie said .  | Potato cook ? ' No . I 'm going with a camera man . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miguel . ' What kind of a movie ? ' Just pictures . No story . ' He looked up as if he 'd thought of something . Do you know Spanish too ? ' What do you mean by " too " ? ' Besides French . ' The girl shook her head . Not in the same way , ' she said . That 's something I 've got to do before summer . I 've been spending four or five afternoons a week talking to a Mexican bartender in Oakland . ' There 's a Spanish Department in the university , ' Janet said in a tone that was just slightly academic . I know , ' MacKenzie said . I work there too . But this bartender knows a lot that is n't in the book . ' He pulled the stoppers from both sides of the sink , dried his hands , and took up a towel and began to dry the dishes . There 's something to it , ' he said . You would n't know French the way you do if you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? ' The girl 's face went suddenly blank , and she looked down at the hand with the puncture in it . No , ' she said . No , I do n't suppose I would . ' The helper dried cups until the towel was damp , and then he found a dry towel and did the saucers . There was no more talk . He finished the drying , hung the cups on hooks in the cupboard , stacked the saucers underneath them , and picked up the brandy glass , clean and dry once more .  | Where 's this go ? ' he said . Leave it out , ' Janet said . He set it back on the cupboard , took off his white coat , rolled it up and put on the brown one , and then leaned back against the sink and looked at the girl . Do you live here , or just work here ? ' Both , ' Janet said . The helper stood with his legs crossed , and leaned back across the sink and got his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his jacket was loose and well cut , and about all he needed was a haircut . He seemed easy , in no hurry , and the girl sat where she was and watched him work on his pipe . Do you go through all that every time you smoke it ? ' she said . No , just once , or maybe twice , a day . ' He had a three-bladed tool on the end of a key-chain , and he reamed the bowl and knocked the cake into the palm of his hand , and then pulled back and forth to see how it drew . When he had it the way he wanted it , he filled it , tamped it with his thumb , and lighted it . Why ? ' he said . Does it make you nervous ? ' No , ' Janet said . It 's very precise and stately , like a minuet . ' Is that so ? I 'll have to give it up . ' He went on smoking , however , and Janet stopped looking at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not moving , not talking , and it lasted a long time . The clock on the oven made an electrical hum , and that was the only sound . Janet sat on the stepladder with her arms around her knees . Her head  | was bent , and her little string of pearls hung down free , not touching her sweater . Ray MacKenzie stood with his back against the sink , and his feet crossed , and his pipe clamped between his teeth . He was the first to do anything . He took his pipe out of his mouth , turned his head and looked down at Janet . Let 's get out of here , ' he said . She turned her head and looked up at him . That 's what I was wanting to say . ' She said it very quietly , and the boy pushed himself away from the sink and stood on his feet . Janet got down from the stool and they faced each other for a moment , and then she moved toward the living room and he followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She went into the bedroom , moved across it to the study , looked inside , and then closed the door . She found her coat and went back to the living room putting it on . MacKenzie was standing beside the door . Janet went to the glass doors . The cat was sitting looking in , and she opened one of the doors , and said , Come on in , ' and he rounded the edge of the door and went to the bedroom , moving low . Janet turned the lock , and came back and looked around the room . She saw the glass on the little table , and she crossed to it , picked up the two capsules and dropped them into the fireplace , and then went to MacKenzie . I 'm ready , ' she said . He turned toward the door . It might be better to go out the other way , ' she said , and she led the way back to the kitchen and  | opened the door to the back stairs . She turned out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs and locked the door behind them . They turned and looked down the steep row of concrete steps . This is the way you did n't come back with the lemons , ' Janet said . I did right , ' the boy said . It 's four flights . ' Do you want me to carry you ? ' No . ' The boy took the lead and they went down the steep stairs and made the sharp turns . Somewhere near the bottom , he stopped and turned around and looked up at her and said , How are you coming ? ' I 'm here , ' she said , and she held out her hand . Something about this , ' he said , reminds me of Richmond . ' He put his hand on one of the concrete walls . Does this have the feel of a penal institution to you ? ' Janet looked down on him . Come to think of it , yes , ' she said , and then he turned around and stepped down , and she followed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy held it open and they went out into the air . Janet turned to close the door , and the boy turned with her . There was an enameled metal plate in front of them : PIEDMONT APARTMENTS Service Entrance  | It 's something I 've never understood , ' Janet said . They call it the Piedmont Apartments , but it 's on top of a hill . ' They stepped off the curb and started walking down the hill , towards the lights . Do you know where we 're going ? ' Janet said . The boy looked down at her . Not exactly , ' he said , but we do n't need to worry .  | ON THE THIRD THURSDAY IN MAY Pauline Maury gave her last tea of the year . It was a big affair ? twice as many guests as usual , smoked salmon instead of cream cheese , and two extra Filipinos instead of Ray MacKenzie . That night Janet Logan left the Piedmont by the back door and walked down the hill alone . There was a moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on the town , down below , and on the houses and the flowers in front of them , and on the flower pinned to the front of Janet 's coat . It was steep going down the hill and she was wearing shoes with heels , but even so she took it reasonably fast , picking them up and setting them down with her ankles under stiff control until she came to the upper edge of the university grounds . Then she ducked between the bars of a fence and took a path through a grove of eucalyptus trees . The trees were thick and close to the path and she had to stop a minute , right after she 'd come in , to  | find herself . She stood still on the path , and caught her breath and looked up to see what had become of the moon , and it was there , where it had been , almost straight up , with leaves in its face and stars around it . While she watched it , the grove got lighter and she went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stayed with the path until it became a sidewalk in among the university buildings and she stayed with the walk until she was out of the gate and into a little section of bright lights ? college clothes , bookstores , malt shops , the first block off any campus . The second block was somewhat less bright ? grocery stores , shoe repairs , a bank , and at the end , on the corner , a music store . The music store was closed for the night , but she went into the little cave between the show windows anyhow , and took a look at the display , and then turned around and waited at the mouth of the cave , while she looked rather carefully up and down the street . There was nothing doing ? three boys across the street scuffing along , three cars parked with nobody in them , nothing else . She waited until the boys got into the next block , and then she came out , turned the corner and ran down a short flight of steps that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It opened into a blind concrete hall , lighted dimly by a reflector lamp at the ceiling , and with four doors , two on each side , cut into it . She went to the last one on the right , and stopped in front of it . It was broad and fire-prooflooking , like doors in storage places , and the name MacKenzie was written in chalk and large across it .  | She knocked lightly right in the middle of the name , then waited , and knocked again . Immediately after the second knock there was the sound of a chair falling over inside , and MacKenzie himself was at the door . Their greeting , verbally , did n't amount to a thing . MacKenzie held the door open , Janet walked past him into the room , and he closed the door , put his back against it , and said , Come here . ' She was halfway across the room when she heard the words and the way they were said , and she turned quickly and walked back to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held her while she had a mild case of the shakes . They stood there , unconsciously barricading the door , holding the wolves at bay , keeping the Indians out , and it was quite a long time before MacKenzie noticed that he had his hand over the flower on Janet 's coat . He took his hand away , and moved her back a little to see if he 'd done any damage . The flower was a brown orchid , small and hard and perfect , and he had n't hurt it any . He looked at it hard , not quite sure he was n't just seeing things , and when he had his mind made up , he said , Where 'd you get that ? ' in a tone he could have used for the Hope diamond . Janet turned her head and looked down at it too . It was n't fluty and all over the place like an ordinary orchid ; it had the absolute perfect symmetry of something turned out by a machine . Pauline , ' Janet said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | MacKenzie kept her at arm 's length , and looked her up and ' down . Jesus , ' he said , maybe I 'd better go shave , ' and then he brought her back to him and looked down at her and told her how she looked ? very damned beautiful , something to break your throat . He unpinned the flower , and took off the coat and tossed it onto a chair , and handed her the flower and the pin . Here , ' he said . Put it on your dress . ' The dress was black , all black , soft and thin as a web , and her hair curved down to the black shoulders , straw colored . It was a nice combination , the blonde hair and the black dress and the orchid , and it made her look at once older and more delicate than she had ever looked in the sweaters and skirts she always wore . She always wore tennis socks , too , and hand-sewn moccasins , but not tonight . Tonight she was wearing no-color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap at the ankles and high narrow heels , very flimsy and elegant ? as beautiful a pair of shoes as Ray MacKenzie had ever seen . He leaned back against the door again and watched her walk away from him pinning the flower to her dress . She crossed the room to the desk , and picked up the chair where he 'd , knocked it over . Then she took a cigarette from a package on the desk , lighted it , shook out the match , and turned around with the cigarette still in her mouth ; and something about the way she did these things gave Ray MacKenzie a sense of never having seen her before . It must have been the sandals that did it , because he 'd seen her before , he 'd stood with  | his back against this door before and watched her walk away from him , and he had seen her light a cigarette like this a thousand times , and keep it in her mouth while she shook out the match . He had seen her in most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashes that catch an attitude and print a memory . He had seen her asleep , all the way out , with one arm crooked behind her head and her hair tangled on the pillow ; he had seen her under a street lamp with gloves on her hands and her coat collar turned up around her neck ; and he had seen her washing her hair , stripped to the waist , wearing a pair of his swimming trunks and feeling around blindly for a towel to wipe the soap off her forehead . He had seen her this way and that way , coming toward him , and going away from him ; but he had never seen her wear a brown orchid and he did n't know she owned these shoes . Where did you get the shoes ? ' he said . She looked down . These ? ' she said . These are my best shoes . ' I can believe it . ' He said it solemnly and with emphasis , and the girl looked worried . Why ? ' she said . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' No , ' he said , there is certainly nothing wrong with them . Only what have you been keeping them for ? ' I do n't know , ' Janet said . Where would I wear them ? ' Wear them to see me , ' Ray said .  | I have , ' she said . I am . ' It 's funny , ' he said , they do something very peculiar to you . Did you just go into a store and sit down and buy them ? ' Yes , ' Janet said . Exactly . ' You have exceptional taste in shoes . I can see that from here . ' Look at something else , will you ? ' Janet said . This is getting me self-conscious . ' Do you wear any particular size ? ' Yes , ' Janet said . As it happens , I do . ' What particular size do you wear ? ' Let 's just forget it . You 're getting a funny look on your face . ' She was perched on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? a light-meter on a cord , some photographic lenses , an envelope full of negatives , and four or five finished pictures . The pictures were all of her , and they were good pictures , sharply caught and composed with style . In all of them she was wearing a white shirt , open at the neck and with the sleeves flipped up a half-turn at the wrist . Nice pictures of my watch , ' she said . What 's it say ? ' She looked closely at the one she had in her hand , and then laid it down and looked at the other ones . Here , ' she said . Ten-fifteen . Or maybe it 's ten minutes to three . ' She suddenly put the pictures down and took a look at her watch , and looked a little relieved . Eight forty-five , in real life , ' she said . God , it 's been a day . '  | Ray pushed himself away from the door and went and sat down on the couch . How was the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Big crowd . ' Who was there ? ' Everybody . After the biggest and oldest ones left Pauline had George make cocktails , and then nobody went home until seven-thirty , and it was a mess . ' She did n't have to give them cocktails if she did n't want to . ' Oh , I know it . She did n't care if nobody ever left . She wanted a cocktail party in the first place , but she could n't quite do it because Mrs. Girard and Professor Hartley and a bunch of them she wanted to invite do n't like them . ' So she waited until they left and then had the party . You do n't find courtesy like that every place . ' Janet picked up the light-meter and twirled it on its cord . This was really a celebration , only nobody knew it . ' She waited a minute , framing something to say , and then she said it . Look , ' she said , I do n't think I 'm supposed to tell this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's have it . ' ' Pauline 's got a new job . ' Ray looked interested . Where ? ' Here , ' Janet said . They had the meeting last night ? the trustees and the board and department heads , the whole bunch , and they recommended and  | conferred and voted , or whatever they do , until two o'clock this morning , and when it was over Dean Kennedy telephoned . Pauline was more or less expecting to get Professor Barzin 's place , but this was better . They made a new job for her and she 's to be called the Girard Professor of French Literature . She 's the first woman in the department that ever got up to a full professorship . ' How 's she taking it ? ' Lying down , ' Janet said . It beats anything she ever hoped to get . ' I do n't see , ' Ray said , that there 's anything so wonderful about it . Now she 'll have to teach French all her life . ' I suppose that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's not what you want , is it ? ' Janet did n't answer . She brushed it off and went on talking about the Official Secret , this Girard Professorship . It was a creation , created out of Mrs. Girard 's money expressly for Pauline Maury ? designed for her so that she would carry only the minimum load of teaching and have leisure to write more books like the last one . Tell me something , ' Ray said . Is that a good book ? ' The girl stopped whirling the meter and looked up , as if she did n't understand him . Of course it 's a good book , ' she said . It 's more than a good book , it 's a great book . ' Funny , ' Ray said , I thought it was terrible . '  | I did n't even know you 'd read it . ' I could n't help it , so much talk about it . Maybe something 's wrong with me , but I had my hands full getting through three chapters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . It was all I could take . ' Janet laughed . That 's the bad part , ' she said . The biographical part is the weak part ; everybody feels the same way . ' Then it 's all right for me to feel that way , too ? ' Yes , it 's perfectly all right . ' Thank you . You do n't know what a relief that is to me . And now may I ask a question ? ' The girl got a cagey look on her face . But when the question came , she could n't be sure it was n't spoken in all seriousness . Which is the good part ? ' Which is the good part of what ? ' Janet said . Do n't let your mind wander . Which is the part that got her the job ? ' Janet looked at him , still puzzled , and then she elected to give out information . The good part , ' she said , is the critical part . ' There was a certain awe in her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no reservations at all , to say what she thought . When she writes about poetry , when she describes any single poem , or makes the attempt to say what went into it and what comes out of it , what caused it , how could anybody write it , how would anybody have to feel to be able to produce such a poem , and then  | where would the inner feeling leave off and the writing begin ? when she puts these things down the way she does , she 's wonderful . ' Is she ? ' Yes . I do n't know how it is that anyone can write so clearly and so simply about such complicated and confusing things . I could n't do it . Almost nobody could . It 's a very particular and special thing , and it 's hers . She 's the one who knows how . ' Ray looked at her , impressed . You mean it , do n't you ? ' he said , and it was clear enough on her face that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said after a while . But I do n't think I ever admired a critic or any kind of an interpreter . ' That 's very retarded-development of you . ' Is it ? Tell me something . Has Pauline Maury ever written any poetry herself ? ' I do n't know . ' If you do n't know , it 's because she has n't . And if she has n't , it 's because she ca n't . She 'd never write about poetry if she could write poetry , do n't you know that ? Nobody would . ' I do n't see that it matters , ' Janet said . What if you 're right ? What if she ca n't ? There 's something humble and generous about the way she 's willing to give all her abilities over to other people 's works . If she thinks French poetry is worth enough for her to devote her life to , why is n't that as big a thing as she can do ? ' That was n't what we were talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wants to . I only said I do n't admire critics . They can be good , but not in the real way . Tell you who I admire I know . You admire Shakespeare . ' Is there anything wrong with that ? ' No , except that it 's so easy . ' All right , then , wait a minute . ' He looked up at the ceiling , thinking hard and looking worried . The trouble is , ' he said , that we do n't know any of the same people . The ones I think of as being great and admirable are mostly still around doing their work , and you 've never heard of them , because they 're around in places where you would n't happen to look . You 've never even seen Bill Robinson dance , and you 've never heard Louie Armstrong play . ' I 've heard all your records . ' But they do n't really get to you , do they ? They ca n't . You ca n't just sit down and listen to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't that way . When anybody 's as good as Louie Armstrong it 's just like anything else that 's really good , it takes a long time to get to know how good it is . It takes a while to see what 's happening . See ? You ca n't come into it cold , and get all there is in it . ' No , I do n't suppose you can . ' He looked at her sharply to see how she meant this . Did you ever hear Wanda Landowska ? ' he said . No . Who 's she ? ' She 's another musician . ' Trumpet ? '  | No . Harpsichord . ' Do you admire her too ? ' He did n't say , but his face took on a happy look just at the thought of her , and he said , Boy ! ' He seemed not to be going to say any more , and then suddenly it broke over and he was telling her about Wanda Landowska . When she plays , something happens . It gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury and sadness , just like Louie , and when she puts it into the music , you know you heard something . They 're like that , both of them , musicians to their heels . ' Oh . What kind of thing does she play ? ' The best kind of thing there is . Bach and Byrd and Purcell . ' Janet considered Bach , and then Byrd and Purcell . You 're getting yourself out on a limb , ' she said . You started all this by saying that you could n't admire a critic or an interpreter . Anyone who plays Bach and Byrd and Purcell is an interpreter . ' There was a silence . Ray felt the back of his neck , and as soon as Janet saw him forced to think , she pushed her advantage . It 's just as much interpretation to play somebody else 's music as it is to write about somebody else 's poetry . ' But you never heard her play . ' No . ' Then you do n't know what you 're talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices long enough can play notes the way they 're written down .  | But let a great musician get hold of a great piece of music and something new comes out of it . It 's not interpretation , then , it 's completion . The notes were always there , but when the right combination is up , it 's not a matter of notes any longer . You do n't know how much is Bach and how much is Landowska and how much is harpsichord . All you know is that you were there , and you heard it , and you 'll never get over it . ' You mean , ' Janet said , that anybody who interprets really well is more than just an interpreter . That 's what I was saying about Pauline . ' All right . I 'll read the good part . ' He looked up and smiled at her . She sat there on the edge of the desk , with her head bent and her stomach thrust forward . It should have been an ungraceful pose , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture good , all beauty was in it , and all youth that looks good no matter how it drapes itself . He watched her a minute before he spoke . Where were we ? ' he said , and she raised her head , trying to remember . You were talking about musicians , ' she said . Do n't you ever think of any examples except musicians ? ' Yes , ' Ray said . I just happened to get started on that . But it 's the same thing , no matter whether it 's writing or music or painting or acting . It 's the same way with a play as it is with a piece of music . Somebody has to put his glasses on and write the thing , think up some situations and complications and put the words down , and it 's a play . Anybody can get a  | cast together and make them learn the lines and put it on and it might be all right . But give it to somebody good , a real actress , and let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then rehearse it with a cast and a director who knows what he 's doing , and watch what comes . The actress takes it over . It does n't belong to the man with the glasses any more . It begins to live ; it begins to mean something ; and it 's big ' exactly in proportion to how much stuff the actress has got in her . ' He broke off suddenly . Did n't you ever want to be an actress when you grew up ? ' Janet looked at her cigarette , crushed it into the ashtray and stabbed with a match at the coals that fell away from it . I do n't suppose any more than is normal for growing girls . Do n't they all want to be , when they grow up ? ' They should n't , ' Ray said . But I think you should . ' Why , for God 's sake ? ' I do n't know , ' Ray said . I really would n't know , but it 's there . It 's in you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I am , ' he said . I 've seen you walk across a room , turn your back and walk away from me , just move away across a floor , and it can knock the wind out of me . I watch that back , and I get the feeling that you know a lot more than you ever let on ? that you 've probably seen your mother and your father and your little brother stood up against a wall and shot . '  | White Russian ? ' Janet said . No ; I 've seen some appalling things , but not that . ' She waited a minute . It 's remarkable , ' she said , the way the theatrical mind will choose its examples . ' Like what ? ' Oh , like seeing your family shot , as an example of horror . ' What 's wrong with it , for horrible ? ' It 's been used . ' Everything 's been used . Can you think of anything any better ? ' Yes , I think I can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then shook her head . I 'd rather not deal with horror . ' All right . If you do n't like your examples do n't go popping off about the theatrical mind . The remarkable thing about my theatrical mind is that it can see the whole world between your shoulder blades when you turn your back . ' You 're not telling me I , should stop being whatever I am and become an actress . ' No , I 'm not telling you anything except that you 've got a very expressive back , and that an expressive back is something only the greatest actresses have . It can create tremendous illusions , properly used ' And I use mine so properly that you can tell what happened to my father and mother against a wall . ' All right , it 's a bad example . But that 's how it is . You give the illusion of knowing a great deal about  | the worst and best things people can know . You can give the illusion of having had close experience with sorrow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , trying to pick other words , and then gave it up and said , It 's terrible how unsure I feel when I look at your back . ' Unsure of what ? ' Unsure of you . ' She gave him a questioning look . Say how , ' she said . I have , ' Ray said . You give me a sense that you 've seen more than I have any idea about . ' I suppose I have , ' she said . Her voice was small and low . Ray waited for her to go on , but she did not go on . Like what ? ' he said . Oh , ' she said , nothing worth wasting time over . How did this start anyhow ? ' I was telling you , ' Ray said , what I admire , and somehow your back got into it . ' Was that it ? No , it started with me telling you about Pauline 's job , and you asked me if her book was any good , and I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good because it 's criticism . ' That 's right . ' And you do n't think anybody 's good but Shakespeare and Bill Robinson and Wanda somebody and Louie Armstrong . ' Yes ; and you . ' The girl looked at him and smiled . Maybe you 're right about me , at that , ' she said . I was a sensation as Prince Hal in the first part of Henry the Fourth . '  | When ? ' My last year at Saint Catherine 's . Where I showed up best was in the big battle scene when we were all darting in and out of the fray with swords and patent-leather hip boots that buckled under our regular shoes . ' Codpieces ? ' I do n't remember . It was Commencement night . ' But you can remember you were good . ' ' Dynamite ! ' Janet said . I 'll never forget it . I had a speech that went , " Come , let me taste my horse ! " and I stopped the show with it . Nobody 'd ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad I was n't there . ' So am I. ' He narrowed his eyes , as if he were watching a curtain go up . I 'll tell you what I 'd like to see you do . It 's a French play called jealousy . I 've got it here some place . ' In French ? ' No , translated . I 'll get it , shall I , and we 'll read a scene , just to see ? ' You 'd see , all right , ' Janet said . Ray got up and started toward the bookshelves , and she stopped him . Make it some other time ; could n't we ? ' ' Why ? This is a thing I 've been leading up to for a long time . ' I know . That 's why I 'd rather not have it be tonight . '  | What 's the matter ? ' I do n't think I could do it . I 'd make a mess of it , and you 'd be disappointed in me . ' She looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said , I 'd much prefer , tonight , not to have you be disappointed in me . ' What 's wrong with tonight ? ' Tonight 's beautiful . But last night was bad , and today has been the longest day in the year . ' What 's wrong ? ' I 'm cross-eyed . ' He gave her a somewhat medical look from across the room . See ? ' she said . I 'm bleary . I 'm groggy . ' I had n't noticed , ' he said . Maybe you are , at that . ' Oh , I am . ' She said it sadly . How did it happen ? ' Ray said . There was a slight edge of disapproval in his voice , and the girl caught it and straightened up quickly and gave answer . It was n't my idea . It was a celebration . Kennedy called up with the news and something had to be done about it . ' I thought you said it was two o'clock . ' It was . ' Kennedy came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with her , do you think ? ' No , I do n't think so . ' Then what 's he hanging around for ? ' Maybe I 'd better start over , ' Janet said . Kennedy telephoned when the meeting was finished . That was  | all there was about Kennedy . He did n't come over . ' What about the party ? ' Last night ? It was n't a party . It was just Pauline , having to rise to an occasion . ' What happened ? ' Champagne , ' Janet said sadly . Champagne in an ice bucket , and hollow-stemmed glasses . ' Caviar ? ' Ray said . No caviar . No solids , all liquids . ' Speeches ? ' Oh , God , yes . ' When did you get to bed ? ' I did n't . Something went flooey with the time and all of a sudden it was a quarter of eight . ' She looked up suddenly . This has been a horrible day , ' she said . Yes , ' Ray said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchids . ' She looked at him with her eyes narrowed a little . Tea , too ; do n't forget the mob that came to tea . ' All right . ' He said the words in a dull , quiet voice , and Janet looked up a little anxious , and said , All right , what ? ' All right , ' he said , I wo n't forget the mob that came to tea . ' What 's wrong ? ' she said . Did I say something wrong ? ' No . ' What 's the matter with you , then ? ' He did n't deny that something was the matter with him . He looked across the room and saw the sandals and let himself look at them .  | Hey ! ' Janet said , and he jumped and looked startled . I thought maybe you 'd gone into a trance , ' she said . Next time throw water on me . ' Would it be too much to ask what you were in a trance about ? ' she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask , but it might be a little hard to explain . He was in a slight trance about her life ; the Life and Times of Janet Logan would make a good descriptive title for this kind of a trance . Your life is pretty exceptional , ' he said . How do you mean ? It 's like everybody else 's . ' No , it is n't . It 's not like mine . ' She did n't take this up , and so he went ahead with it . Not like his , he said , at all . For one thing , she did n't live in a basement ; she lived up in the air , all glassed in . Her meals were served by a fairy Filipino and she drank vintage wines with them ; she spent an hour a day under a sun lamp ; she spoke French as much as she spoke English ; she owned a stack of Lucienne Boyer records and had never heard of Bessie Smith ; she went around with people twice her age ; she stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with sedatives . No , I do n't , ' Janet said . I 've quit that . ' All right , you used to . Now you do n't even go to bed . ' The girl looked at her hands and then at her fingernails . I wish I knew , ' she said , what we 're mixed up about . Do we have to live the same kind of life ? '  | No , I do n't suppose we do . But sometimes it seems to me that there is n't much chance of our ever getting together . We 're all parceled out in separate compartments with labels on them . Right down the line . To start out with , you 're a Catholic and my old man 's a Calvinist minister . ' What about it ? I 'm not a good Catholic . And you 're not your old man . ' Ray looked a little happier . That 's right , ' he said . But that 's only the beginning of it . You 're out of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been doing , it always sounds to me like something I never heard tell of , even if I have . The people you know , the clothes you wear , the places you go , the music you like , the books you read . You 're breathless about a book I could n't get started with . How can that be ? ' That 's not so hard to figure out , ' Janet said . What I ca n't understand is why you 'd bother to read it in the first place . ' Why should n't I ? It 's a free country . ' Yes , it 's a very free country . So you do n't have to read a book that 's all taken up with things you 'll never be much concerned with . ' There was a long piece of quiet in the room . The boy put his hand up and rubbed his cheek and frowned , and then he spoke slowly . I thought it would be nice , ' he said , if I read something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on : That 's what I 'm trying to say . You and I do n't have a whole hell of a lot in common , do you know it ? '  | The words came across the room , no distance at all , faster than light , and the girl shook her head as if she 'd been hit . She sagged a little , and then she straightened up and wound the cord carefully and precisely around the light-meter , taking her time , and when there was nothing left to do to it , she set it down on the desk , and looked up , and said : Do n't we ? ' They looked at each other across the space that separated them ; then Ray stood up from the couch and Janet slid down from the desk and they moved in toward each other and met halfway . The words came fast then ; Ray was telling her to say them and she was saying them without pause and meaning it , and they both knew this was true , this was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , then everything in the world would have to be reclassified . Maybe they had n't read the same books , but if it was a matter of speaking the same language , they spoke it , they were speaking it , and when Ray put his fist under her chin and pushed her head back and looked down at her and asked her what her name was , she looked up at him and answered in a voice that was his own voice : As far as I can tell , ' she said , my name 's MacKenzie . ' Did you say that ? ' I do n't know . It 's what I meant . ' The walls of the room were white concrete basement walls ; and there was light from a tin-hooded flood light , photographic equipment , that stood on a  | three-pointed base in a corner , and threw the brightness on them and showed them as they were , Ray MacKenzie , lost , looking down into the wide green eyes with the fringy lashes , and Janet Logan with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle of her hair , saying what she had to say and what she could n't stop saying . The spotlight was on them , and the spell , and they stood there bewitched and helpless , both of them , intense and never smiling , making their speeches with words they forced to their purpose . How old are you ? Tell me , you with the shoes on . ' I do n't know . ' How old did you say ? ' Twenty-three , ' Janet said . I 'm twenty-three years old . ' The age of consent . ' Yes , most willingly . ' He lifted her up into his arms then and carried her to the couch and put her down , and then he was beside her , saying welcome , beautiful ; welcome home . She looked up at him a minute , and then turned over and lay face-down with her head in her arms . How are you ? ' Ray said . Terrible . I 'm very seriously in love . ' Then do n't lie on your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little muffled . I want to tell you something . ' Tell me turned over . ' I could n't do it if I looked at you . ' All right . '  | She lay there stretched full length on the couch with her face hidden in her arms and Ray propped himself on an elbow and waited , and nothing happened . She was still as death , her ribs did n't even move when she breathed . Nothing broke the quiet . The boy looked down at the black dress and waited . Then , very suddenly , there was a great deal of jouncing around , and Janet got her knees under her and sat up and put one foot on the floor , like a kid getting out of a coaster wagon , and stood up beside the couch . What 's the matter ? ' Ray said . She was straightening her belt , I want a cigarette , ' she said . Ca n't you think without smoking ? ' No . ' You 're a slave . ' I suppose so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package , and felt in it , and then twisted it up and dropped it , and went and found her purse and brought a cigarette case out of it , snapped it open , carried it to the couch and offered it to Ray . He took it , and turned it over and looked at it before he gave it back . It was black enamel and the silver letters J. L. lay across the top . Very handsome , ' he said . He handed it to her and she turned away and walked back to the desk . Look at me , ' Ray said , and she turned around with a match in her hand . What were you going to say ? ' he said . She looked away from him and watched the match  | until it burned almost down to her fingers and then dropped it into the ashtray . Nothing , ' she said . Did you change your mind ? ' No , ' she said . But I ca n't remember what it was . ' She tore another match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinate her the same way . Quit that , ' he said . What ? ' Lighting matches . ' She looked up . Why ? ' she said . Because it 's wasteful . It starts forest fires . Come here , ca n't you ? ' She put the match to the cigarette , and waited a minute before she answered . Then she said , No , I do n't think I 'd better . ' She did n't wait for him to ask any questions . I guess I 'll have to say it , ' she said . I 'm afraid to . ' Ray unpropped himself and sat up fast . Tell me what 's happened , ' he said . The girl was still . After a minute she shook her head and took a quick , unconscious look at her watch . She looked tired now , and you could see it ? the way you can see it in close-ups of survivors of shipwreck , and she made a try at saying how it was and what it was that had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no describing what a little dog of a day this had been , or what a complete little son of a bitch of a night before , either , and she knew towards the end of the afternoon that there was only one thing for it and that was to break out somehow and come here , to jerk  | herself loose from all those people and come to this one place , the one place she ever wanted to be . Then what is there to be afraid of ? ' Ray said . You made it , and we 're here . ' The words did n't do much good , her face was sad , and she did n't try to hide it . This is it , ' Ray said . Look . Pictures , records , table , walls . You 're here . This is where we live , when we live . ' No , we do n't , ' she said . She said it quietly , almost in a whisper , but it carried , and Ray heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is n't true . We do n't live anywhere , and we ca n't live anywhere . ' Ray got up and started to say something , but she began to talk again in a way that cut him down . Something 's wrong about it , ' she said . It gets to be a nightmare , does n't it ? ' No , ' Ray said . You 're a bad guesser , ' she said , the way you like to imagine my life . You see me always lying under a sun lamp , always in a glow , up to my ankles in clover . ' She drew a breath and went on . Well , that 's not it , ' she said . What I do is wait . I wait and wait and when the chance comes I grab it and come here . ' She pulled hard on the cigarette , blew out a long straight stream of smoke , and watched it , while she said , I think I know how those salmon feel coming up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful comparison . ' It 's not very beautiful getting here . I 've become a  | night-prowler , do you know it ? I spend my time sneaking around town at night , coming here and having to leave , and always trying not to be seen . ' And you 're tired of it ? ' She hesitated a minute and then she said , Yes . ' Ray looked pleased . Me too , ' he said . I 'm sick to death of it . ' He kept on looking pleased . You mean it , do n't you ? ' he said . Janet nodded , and he went on . You know what people do , when they get hit like this ? ' She knew . They get married , but she would n't say it . They wait for chances , like me , ' she said . They prowl around nights . ' No , Ray said ; but she would n't let him say the rest of it . They do what they can , she said . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do the sort of thing she got caught in today at the damned tea . She was standing beside the fireplace with a cup and saucer in one hand and a sandwich and a cigarette in the other , rather a fistful , talking dutifully and she hoped intelligently to one of the guests . Nothing very interesting , just purely routine academic talk about examinations and studies and prospects . The man was asking her how her work was going and what she intended to do ; and she was telling him that she could n't see any end to it right now , she was so snowed under with papers to write and examinations to take , but that when she was clear about it she supposed another year would see her  | through , and then she imagined she 'd do what Ph.D . ' s are expected to do ? she 'd go forth and teach French . Where , the man wanted to know , and she was vague about it , the way the jobless must be vague . She must have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job at a French school he knew about in Mexico City . It was just a question , in line with things they 'd been saying , but she never answered it , because when he said the word Mexico ' something happened to her . Her cup began to click on the saucer and kept it up , getting louder , until she had to set it down on the mantel and count ten before she had herself again . No reason for it , except that when he said Mexico ' she got hit with a sudden vision of a town she 'd never seen , a place called San Miguel where Ray MacKenzie would be making a picture this summer . Just like that , the thing happened and ripped everything wide open and left her there in the full light of day , transfixed , you might say , bowled over , knocked in a heap . That 's the way it is , ' she said . I have to think about you all the time , because if it ever sneaks up on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not expecting it , all the stuff goes out of my knees . I get the bends . Anybody that looks can see it . ' Her head was down , and her hair fell forward . You 're wonderful , ' Ray said . No , I 'm terrible . I 'm a mess . I do n't see how you can have anything to do with me . I do n't . I really don't. '  | She raised her head and looked at him and said it again . Ray stood up and took a step toward her . I do n't either , ' he said . How are your knees ? ' Water , ' she said . Nothing but water . ' He came and stood beside her , not touching her , and looked down at the top of her head and asked her how much longer she thought she could stand this . She did n't answer or look up . She had her hands clenched and she put her fists up and covered her eyes a minute , and Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and stood in front of the door and turned the key . The lock made a cool heavy click when it hit the other side . There , ' he said , and when he turned around she had come away from the desk and was standing behind him , shaking her head . Do n't lock it , ' she said . Would you mind not locking it ? ' He looked a little dumbfounded , and said , Why ? ' and then it was her turn to say something and she looked down at the floor and stammered slightly , making words without knowing quite what they were going to be . Because if ? listen . I do n't know why . ' It was n't much good as an answer , and she made another try . Maybe we 're not safe , ' she said . And maybe if the door were locked it would look peculiar . ' Are you nuts ? What would look peculiar ? ' I do n't know . ' She turned her back and walked  | away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said again , insisting on it . It would be peculiar to leave it unlocked , if you ask me , ' Ray said . I know , ' she said . But , I 've got a funny feeling . I do n't know why . I 've got a feeling someone saw me turn the corner , and come down the steps and into your door . I 've got a feeling somebody might come into this room and find us and do something terrible to us . ' It was a little hard for Ray to understand . Do you really mean that ? ' he said . I think so . ' Who 'd want to do anything to us ? ' How do I know ? Anybody . G-men , maybe . ' So I should leave the door unlocked and let somebody , or a couple of G-men , come in and do things to us ? ' I know , ' she said . I know I do n't make any sense . I do n't want to be this way , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have any idea why . It 's just there ; and I ca n't make it stop . ' She was walking while she talked . She stopped once in a while to look abstractedly at things she saw , but she was n't stammering now ; she was talking fast and bursting out with the things she had to say . Maybe I do know what it is , though , ' she said . I think it 's this thing of having to hide , having to keep it always covered , that 's got me . ' She stopped and looked up , straight at him . If we did n't want each other every minute ,  | would n't be so bad , would it ? If we could only be easier , say like a couple of people drinking a cup of coffee in a drug  --  tore , reading the paper . Or here , even , if we were n't sunk so deep . We could be here and not be afraid , and somebody would knock at the door or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say , " Hello , Charlie ; hello , Harry ; come on in . We were just thinking about making some scrambled eggs . " ' Who 're Harry and Charlie ? ' Old friends of ours ; they come in without knocking and we 're glad to see them . ' ' I do n't like the looks of the little one . Tell him to go home . ' But they 're our friends . They 're the only friends we 've got . ' Oh , all right . Sit down , boys . Hell , spend the night . ' See ? Is n't it nice to have friends ? ' Sure , it 's all right , only get them some eggs . Poor bastards look starved . ' I know , ' Janet said , especially Harry , ' and she was going to go on with it , but when she looked up at Ray , her voice got weak , and she said : That 's the way it should be . It ought to be free and easy and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back doors . Do you know , if I had my way , my life would be nothing but you and me and Harry and Charlie in here talking with the door wide open . ' We can fix it , ' Ray said . Simplest thing in the world . '  | How ? ' she said , and there was a great deal more of skepticism than of hope in the way she said it . We 'll get married . ' No . ' The word tore out of her mouth like a bullet . Why not ? ' We ca n't , that 's all . I 've told you . We ca n't . ' I can . ' Well , I ca n't . ' Yes , you can . Look , we ca n't stall around like this forever . It 's painful . It 's against the grain . ' The girl heard it , and turned her back , and said in a voice just loud enough for him to hear : All right , then . Let 's quit . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and turned her around . He was rough about it and his hands bit into her arms when he touched her . She did n't seem to notice . She looked into his face quite solemnly and questioningly , and she seemed almost to be asking his advice and still relying on him , when she said it again : Ca n't we stop ? Ca n't we just stop the way we are now , before we get into something we , something we wo n't ... ' She stopped and her tongue moved across her lips , because she was stuck . There was nothing to say . There was a great deal Ray could say . He held her by the shoulders almost as if she were an old coat he was looking over for moths , and when he began to talk he asked her some things he thought he ought to know . He thought he ought to know why it was that she could come here like this , on this night , after all  | the other nights , walk in here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , stretch herself against him and tell him to his mouth that she was here because she could n't stay away ? tell him everything he believed , everything he knew , and then turn her back on it when he wanted , again , to marry her . Suddenly look at him out of the bottoms of the green eyes with the fringy lashes , sock her fingers into that wig of hair , twist that lovely perplexed pan until it was the face of all the damned , and force the liquid voice down into the rough to say , All right , then , let 's quit . ' No , that can not be done . That does n't go . What goes is something else . What they needed was not to quit , but to go greatly forward , and take their chances and live like human beings ... sit across from each other at dinner , and more especially at breakfast , wake up together in the morning instead of wondering whether you dreamed it or not , lie around and drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting , good and bad direction , photography , music , and all the things there are . There 's enough to talk about to last forever . And then work . Work 's the second-best thing in the world if your work is something that gets under your skin and takes you all up so that it is n't work any more ; it gets to be a tendency , like playing horses , and you could n't stay away from it if you had to . You and me and the camera man this summer , ' he said . I 've got a feeling we 'll be good . ' Janet stiffened up under his hands and there was a look of supplication on her face , a look that goes from the oppressed to the oppressor.  | No , ' she said . Please do n't say it . There wo n't be any summer . Not this summer or any other summer . So do n't talk about it . ' She said it furiously in a burst , and it took it out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ray held her up and looked at her curiously . When he spoke to her again , he was firm and patient as if he were dealing with an overtired and willful child . Go sit down , ' he said . There . By the desk . Go on . Sit down . Right there . Yes . Now sit down . There . That 's right . ' He stood his ground . His feet were planted firmly and he knew his direction . Things were going badly , for no sensible reason , and it was most important for him to put them straight . You 've got to get straight , ' he said . You 're working too hard , I do n't know , or not getting enough sleep , or worrying too much about the way things go . You 're punchy . You 're going in circles . ' I do n't need to be told , ' Janet said . I live in it . ' Well , you 've got to get out of it , and right away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this damned thing of going to school . I do n't know why , but it gets them , the whole bunch of them , it shoots them to pieces . Especially the good ones , like you . You learn too much , and you take it so fast you never get time to find out what it means . It 's the same way with all the ones that get into it deep . They get balled up ; they ca n't help it . ' He waited , and she kept her head down . Something 's bad about it , ' he said . It 's a terrible  | way to live , ' and Janet nodded , convinced ahead of time . You 'd say , would you , that I 'm badly balled up ? ' Why ? Are n't you ? ' Yes , ' she said . I am . It 's so bad I 'd never know where to start unballing myself . ' Well , why do n't you get out ? ' he said , and when she opened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he began telling her again , standing there in front of her , looking down at her sprawled on the chair , and telling her what ought to be , what counts and what does n't . It is n't as if you belonged here , ' he said . It is n't as if we were a couple of librarians . We 're not . Look at us . We 're ' ? he paused and fell into language he 'd picked up in Sunday School ? we 're the elect , the elite , we 're the chosen . It does n't happen like this to everybody . But it happens like this to us . Does n't it ? ' Janet did n't look at him when she answered . Yes , it does . Unfortunately . ' What the hell do you mean , unfortunately ? ' he said , and he wanted to know . He could n't understand it , and he would never be able to understand her feeling about it . She always seemed to feel that being in love was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one of the incurable diseases , something that must be held off and hidden as long as possible ; when he could only think of it as something positively good , something to be accepted , if offered , with gratefulness . Life itself is very interesting and  | very pleasant , and if love also happens to be thrown in , it 's velvet . It 's supposed to surpass bread as a thing to live by . I know , ' she said . I 've heard that . ' But you do n't think so ? ' No , I do n't think so . ' She turned around and found the black-enamel case again , and snapped it open . I wish it could be the way you say , ' she said . But it ca n't be . ' Yes , it can , ' he said . Listen to me . ' Janet started to get up , and he put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her back and said the rest . This is n't a proposal , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll get married . It takes three days . This is Thursday . We 'll apply tomorrow . Friday , Saturday , Sunday . We 'll get married Sunday morning . ' No , ' Janet said . Sunday we 'll still be single . ' Sunday we 'll be married . Early Sunday morning . ' Janet tightened her fists and hit them on the back of the chair . Do n't , ' she said . Let me alone , for God 's sake . We have n't got time for this . I 've got to go in a minute . Let 's not fight . ' I 'm not fighting , ' Ray said . I 'm proposing . ' I know , ' she said . But do n't . ' Ray looked at her , baffled , trying to see into her . She 'd got herself together a little . She 'd stopped beating the back of the chair , but her fists were still tight . He saw her there , lovely and bewildered , with  | an orchid on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got things backwards ; and it 's serious . Why should you feel wrong about this ? There 's nothing wrong . We 're wonderful . We 're perfect . You ca n't feel this way , as if there were something guilty about us . It 's no way to feel . You wish we could be open and above-board and sit around and talk to a couple of guys named Harry , and not worry . You wish we could be easy and have some friends and not be tied in this close little knot . Well , we can . We will . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . People live in the open , people have friends , and read the paper , and drink , and horse around . And this is how it happens . It 's A B C. They fall in love . It 's something that happens to them . And they ca n't stand it any other way , so they get married . And they generally go off on a trip , like a week-end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until they 're ready to get up and look around and see what the rest of the world is like . That 's how it has to be , you dope . They 're married and everybody accepts it and lets them alone and they do as they please as long as they damned please . Nothing to worry about . And after a while they relax . They get to the place where they can sit through a movie without looking at each other . Go right into a movie and watch the picture . It 's wonderful . You wait . It will happen to us . And then we 'll be set . ' Janet did what she could to keep her voice level when she answered him , but it broke down around the edges . I never should have come here tonight , ' she said .  | I should have stayed out . I should have known when I was well off . ' She began to cry . Her face was set and white and there was no expression on it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks , and she brushed them away with her hands and looked disgusted with herself . All right , cry , ' she said , and she put her hands over her face and let it go , and talked at the same time in little spasms . I do n't know , I do n't know , I do n't know , I do n't know . ' Ray came up to her and put a hand out to touch her head and then drew it back . He 'd never seen her cry before , and he was like a bystander at a smash-up , ready to give first aid , but not remembering whether the book said to move them or let them lie . You ought to go to bed , ' he said , very quietly , and with full sympathy . You 've had enough for today . We 'll forget all about it until tomorrow . ' What time is it ? ' she said , and he bent over and looked at her wrist . Ten minutes past nine . Darling , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaning over her telling her please to take it easy , not to let him , or anything , worry her , because you ca n't get anywhere figuring things out when you 're beat . The only thing is to say to hell with it and go to bed and go to sleep , and see how it looks in the daytime . And if she would remove this finery now , and go over there and lay herself down , she 'd be better for it ; eight hours would put her on her feet . All in our places with sunshiny faces .  | What kind of a twist have you got on this ? ' he said . He was trying to unpin the flower , and having trouble , and when there was a small tap on the door , he did n't notice it . Janet looked up fast . Did you hear that ? ' she said . What ? ' he said , and she nodded her head toward the door , and there was another tap , or rather three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet got off the chair , and they stood side by side looking at the door as if it were a locomotive coming at them . Ray turned and raised his eyebrows in a question : well , shall I open it , or do we play dead ? and then they heard the sound of footsteps going down the hall , and then suddenly coming back again , and then there were more taps on the door , very close to imperative . The two of them did n't consult after this . It was a demand , and Ray put the orchid and the pin on the desk and went across the room and turned the doorknob , and then turned the key and opened the door . It was Pauline Maury standing in the hall . They stood , one on each side of the door , Ray MacKenzie and Pauline Maury , and looked each other over . Ray MacKenzie apparently did n't believe it ; it was clear in his manner that he was accusing himself of seeing a woman who was n't there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . She stood just outside the frame of the door , dressed for the evening ? fur coat , long skirt , no hat . Her hair was brushed back from her face , very black and bright  | like the hair on a china doll . There were two small rubies in her ears , and the scent that surrounded her and floated out from her was spicy , very brash and clear . This was the second time in his life Ray MacKenzie had seen her , and he seemed unsure how to welcome her or how to accept her . But on Pauline Maury 's part there were no doubts or hesitations . She was perfectly sure what she was here for , and in no way embarrassed about it . When the waiting at the door had gone on long enough , she put an end to it . May I ? ' she said , and she came through the open door , past Ray , and into the room . She showed no surprise at seeing Janet . She went immediately to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . She looked around the room as she said it , pleasantly taking it in ? the pictures , the books , the couch , the desk ? saying at the same time the rest of her sentence : And I was right . Here you are . ' There was something humorous in all this . There was a small smile on her mouth and it seemed every minute to be going to become a laugh , long and sweet and merry . It was as if she had just found Janet stooping to pick up a purse which some children had attached to a string . When the purse began to withdraw , she would laugh . Right now she was waiting . Something should have come from Janet , some question , some expression of surprise , or apology , something vocal , but there was no sound at all , and it was clearly up to Ray to be spokesman . It was his house .  | He cleared his throat slightly , coming away from the door . Wo n't you sit down ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Thank you , ' Pauline Maury said . She did n't sit down . There was really no place to sit , except the couch or the chair beside the desk , and so instead of sitting she walked across the room and stood beside the bookshelves in front of the little portable phonograph . The room was warm for her and she opened her coat and pushed the collar back , away from her neck . The dress beneath the coat was a two-part arrangement ? a long black skirt that fell straight as a plumb line to the floor , and above it a tunic of bright Roman stripes , red and black and blue and green going round and round . It was as simple as a crew shirt , neat but dazzling , and she wore it with the ease and assurance of one who feels better at night than in the daytime . She held her gloves , black , in one hand and slapped them against the other hand . The extravagant feet were entirely hidden by the long skirt , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She might have been barefoot , except that a steady tapping sound kept itself going down there somewhere . She stood waiting , straight and small and bound round with fur . She slapped one hand with her gloves and tapped her foot , but with no show of impatience . She was waiting , but she was a good waiter , and she could hold her peace until someone spoke , or until something or other happened . Ray MacKenzie , for his part , had no assurance at  | all . He looked anxious and abstracted , hunting for something , whatever it was , cup of coffee , can of beer , plate of cheese , some sign of hospitality that would make everything all right . Then he remembered what it had started out to be . He went to the desk , picked up the twisted cigarette package , dropped it again , and then took the enamel case . He carried it across the room , snapped it open on the way , and offered it , and Pauline Maury accepted . She took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then without taking a cigarette , she snapped it shut , turned it over once or twice , and slid it into the pocket of her coat . Thank you very much , ' she said . I do n't smoke . ' It took Ray by surprise , and he looked around at Janet as if to ask her if she intended to let someone swipe her cigarette case so openly and brazenly . But Janet was n't caring about the cigarette case . She was looking steadily down at the floor , very carefully avoiding the sight of anything else . She hung on to the back of the chair and looked humbly down . Clearly again , she should have done the talking ; she was the link between Ray and Pauline Maury , she was the common ground ; but she refused to accept the responsibility , and in the end it was Pauline Maury , the stranger , the newcomer , who took it on herself to make words . As words , they were n't much , but at least they gave the impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coat pocket , the one with the cigarette case in it , and she said , almost as if in answer to a question : I do n't know why I 've never happened to start  | smoking . I 've simply never felt the need , and so I 've never tried . ' No one answered this , and so she went on . As far as I know the only thing against it is that it smooches the teeth . ' I suppose it does , ' Ray said , and he made a sort of face , running his tongue across his front teeth . It has no importance , ' Pauline Maury said , almost philosophically . It 's like the problem of drinking . If you do n't like it , it 's bad . If you do , it does n't matter . ' She stopped abruptly , conversational responsibility discharged . The sound of her voice had filled the room with life , and when it stopped everything went dead . She pulled her coat around her , indication that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' she said . She said it in a matter-of-fact tone , unemphatically , and with it she gave a completely convincing impression that she and Janet had come here together , had had a pleasant time , and now must leave . One expected Janet Logan to say her proper good-byes , and come along . But Janet Logan did not respond . She stayed where she was , holding tight to the back of the chair , as if she felt rocky and could n't trust herself to stand alone . She raised her head and looked at Pauline Maury with no expression at all , and did n't answer . Get your coat ! ' Pauline Maury said . You had one , did n't you ? ' There was a little edge to this . Janet swallowed a couple of times , and when she spoke her voice barely sounded .  | Go ahead , ' she said . I 'll be back later . ' Pauline Maury 's response was immediate and clear . No , ' she said . I 'd prefer to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis . She gave it the sound of a simple preference , simply stated , very smooth and pleasant , but it had precisely the opposite effect on Janet . She tightened up with the sound of it . All her force came back with a rush , and she picked up the chair she 'd been leaning on and banged it down on the floor and her voice banged down with it . Do n't do this , ' she said . Do n't do what ? ' Pauline Maury said . I 'm not going , that 's all , ' Janet said . I wo n't go . ' Oh ? ' No , I 'm not going . ' She was n't holding on to the chair any more . She was standing on her own feet . Where do you want her to go ? ' Ray said . He spoke quietly in an attempt to restore a conversational tone to this unfathomable clash . Pauline Maury had kept her eyes fixed on Janet so steadily that she had begun to take on the air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked away , and her manner changed . She became all at once clear-cut and decisive . The first thing she did was answer the question . I want to take her home where she belongs , ' she said . I know where I belong , ' Janet said , and Pauline Maury turned and looked at her with fury that  | burned white in her eyes . She could n't speak to her , but she held her voice together and spoke to Ray . I had hoped , ' she said , that there would not be any trouble about this . ' Does there have to be ? ' Ray said . She took one look at Janet , who was still standing firm . Apparently there does , ' she said . Apparently there is no willingness to do anything else . ' She slapped her hand hard with the gloves , then she shoved them into her pocket , pushed her coat back , away from her neck , and began to talk . Her voice was cold and clear , and the words jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then settled into steady , balanced periods . I do n't know what I expected , ' she said , but I was afraid when I came here that this would be what I would find . ' She made a quick movement with her hands , as if she were trying to control the things she said and the disgust she felt , but there was no controlling it . Here it was , this cellar , this dark hole below stairs , where she had come . She had had to come here , and to find it and to face all the dirty little hackneyed details of it ? the slowness in opening the door , the disarrangement of the room , the craven look on the faces , fear at first , nothing but fear , and then immediately afterwards the shoddy show of defiance , like criminals who cringe first and then boast . The words were all directed at Janet , and Pauline Maury was right about it , there was fear on her face .  | Ray watched her and looked worried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck to one side as if his collar hurt him . You do n't need to be afraid , ' Pauline Maury said to Janet . There was contempt in her voice , the contempt of a strong one for a coward . I sha n't give you away . But we must be clear about it . I do n't intend to continue protecting you , and covering up for you , if you ever again allow yourself to have another lapse of taste like this one . ' Look , ' Ray said , but she would n't let him into it , and she went on saying how it had to be . No more below-stairs liaisons . What Janet Logan must do from now on was to take care of herself and take care . If you want her to take care of herself , ' Ray MacKenzie said , why do you get her tight and keep her up all night ? ' Pauline Maury 's attention had been centered on Janet , and when she heard this she turned , rather slowly and deliberately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said , and before Ray could repeat it or add to it , Janet 's voice came up between them . I did n't tell him that , ' she said . I did n't say it . Do n't believe it , because I did n't . ' Then what did you tell me ? ' Ray said . Oh , God , ' Janet said , mostly to herself and then she turned to Pauline Maury again . Do n't look that way . I tell you I did n't say it . I did n't say it that way . I only said I 'd been up late and that I had to go home early . '  | And I suppose , ' Pauline Maury said to Ray , you were trying to force her to spend the night here . ' She let her eyes wander around the room as she said it , and a look of utter distaste touched her mouth . Here was all she said , but the look on the mouth described it , this damp place for snails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the smallest , least ennobling kind of misconduct . Yes , ' Ray said , I was . ' You were aware , of course , that I have known about this all along . ' I have n't asked any questions , ' Ray said . I have known , ' Pauline said . There is no way to be unaware of a thing like this . There is no way not to notice the change it has made in Janet , no way not to see the fingers always tapping , the lies always being prepared , the excuses mounting , the nerves jumping , and the illness lurking . I have tried . I have tried to ignore it , to hold to our life and to hope that this other thing would stop , would fall apart of its own stupidity , once it got past the blind stage , the blind-urge stage . ' She made a little face , a slight twitch of disgust , a little facial quirk that made the thought complete . The twitch , the quirk , said clearly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolutely non disputandum , and it was regrettable but true that well-bred dogs named Fifi tend occasionally to mate with dogs of no distinction , tramps named Blackie . This , in spite of anything their owners and wellwishers can do . The urge , the blind urge , comes , and whttt , where 's Fifi ?  | I was not , after all , born yesterday , ' she said . I 'm capable of recognizing a thing of this kind when it pushes itself in my face . How long is it ? Two months ? Nine weeks ? For me it 's been a strange nine weeks , I may say . Nine weeks of wondering what to do , whether to go on pretending to see nothing and take the chance that others were also seeing nothing , or whether to come out clearly and put a stop to it before someone else found out about it , someone in authority who would make it his duty to expel you from the university . ' She waited . And it was this that decided me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't sit by and let it happen , do you see ? There is too much to lose , and it is much too valuable . I could n't do it . ' She looked at Janet . It was her value she was talking about . She might not look so valuable right now , ill and exhausted , with this gone look in her eyes , and this spattering of fear and shame on her face ; and there was no denying that Pauline Maury would have a difficult time , right now , defending her to the ones who might be interested in her lapses , the ones who would presently be considering her for a position of some importance in the university . But fortunately there would be time . No one would see her right now . Of the ones interested in her career no one but Pauline Maury would have to see her as she was here . And fortunately again , Pauline Maury would be the only one who would be willing to bring her back , to restore her , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  | eyes and this pallor left her face , until she could walk straight and think straight and act straight . This , Pauline Maury alone could do for her . And this she was willing , God knows why , to do . She was talking dispassionately now , quietly and with restraint . And she appeared to be talking to no one , but merely to be stating the case as she saw it and as she believed it , for her own benefit , to help her to lay it straight . Why should I have done all that I 've done ? ' she said . Why was it I had such faith in one single student among all the many ? Can I have been wrong ? ' She looked at Janet . I did a dangerous thing , ' she said , when I took you into my home , and let you take your place among my friends , and have the run of my library , and sleep in my study and eat at my table . And I did it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I could do for you were essential to make you the kind of person I knew you could become . ' Janet raised her head and started to speak . No , ' Pauline Maury said . Wait . I have n't lost faith in you even now . When I took you in , my friends all told me I was mad . And I must say I wondered , myself , whether I were mad or only brave . Because you see in a way it was frightening to consider that I would be held responsible for what you might become . It was I who taught you , the books you read were mine , and the wines you tasted , and since I did you the honor of never talking down to you , the ideas  | you accepted were mine . And I knew perfectly that whatever you became would be either to my credit or to my discredit . I was anxious , naturally , but I never really lost faith , and I knew the day would come when you would justify it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for a moment at Ray . He was standing with his feet apart and his hands stuck deep in his pockets . He did not look at either Pauline or Janet . After a moment the voice went on . I wonder , ' she said , that I never once changed my mind about you . I knew you were erratic , and I was always able to excuse that on the grounds that all brilliant minds are erratic . Even when you were ill , when the disease showed up and you lost all touch with reality and there was no way for me to deal with you or talk to you or help you back , I still knew that I would n't turn you out or let anyone know of it , and I had always the faith that you would find your way back . ' She looked again at Ray . Since these things have had to come out , I may as well tell you that I had Janet committed to a sanitarium last year . But I did it in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Her voice was curiously vibrant , and while she spoke she watched Ray 's face closely . I 'm sorry it was necessary for me to tell you this . ' I knew about it , ' Ray said . He seemed to attach no importance to knowing about it , and Pauline Maury turned away from him  | and looked with astonishment and disbelief at Janet . Where can he have heard this ? ' she said . I told him , ' Janet said . You ca n't have done such a thing . Janet , look at me . Did you know what you were doing ? ' Yes . ' You fool , you utter little fool . ' She started toward Janet , as if she were going to take her by the shoulders and shake her . How in the world could you do it ? ' she said , and Ray stepped forward at the same time . Did n't you just tell me ? ' he said . There is n't much to it . Those things are n't serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she spoke . Is that what she told you ? That it was n't serious ? ' No , I told her . ' Do you know so much , then , about mental dis-eases ? ' I know about nervous breakdowns . My brother had a beauty . ' Pauline Maury looked at him with something like pity . Since Janet was so eager to exhibit herself , ' she said , she might have been honest about it . This was not a nervous breakdown . I was with her at the time . I have talked to the doctor , and ... ' She closed her mouth on what she was going to say , and said , If she gave you the impression this was anything so simple as a nervous breakdown , she lied . ' No , I did n't , ' Janet said . I do n't know what was the matter with me. '  | Pauline Maury nodded her head slowly and spoke almost tenderly . That 's true , ' she said . You do n't . ' She turned suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? ' Yes , ' Ray said . What is your full name , please ? ' Raymond J. MacKenzie . ' And are you in the university ? ' Off and on , ' Ray said . She looked questioning about this and Ray explained that he worked sometimes , and then when he was n't working he went back to the university , but he never should be thought of as a student , in the big , serious sense , because he was in the Department of Dramatic Arts , where all they do is mess around with plays . Pauline Maury showed no interest in the account . Her manner was strictly official . Are you in the university now ? ' Yes , I am . ' Pauline Maury looked at him speculatively . Why ? ' Ray said . Is something wrong with me ? ' She began slowly . I should not like to make any trouble for you , Mr. MacKenzie . I do n't know that I can tell you how I feel about it . I do n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I should , I know this , report you to the ones who make this sort of irregularity their business . But I 'm afraid I sha n't be able to do it . Somehow that way of dealing is foreign to me . I am  | not an agent of police , nor a dean of women , nor any of those rugged types . ' Good , ' Ray said . She did not smile . She looked at him coldly , still speculating . No , ' she said . I 'm not meant for discipline . I can never bring it off . I 'm simply what I am ? a teacher , a writer , a woman . I 'm not even a mother . ' She looked at Janet when she said this . And yet , ' she said , I feel like one . If I did n't feel like one , I could never have forced myself here tonight . ' She stopped and spoke more quietly . I would n't be trying to get my child out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray said , and again she ignored him , and spoke up briskly . As I say , I have no heart in discipline . But we must come to a definite agreement . I must ask you not to see Janet again . And in return , I shall not make the report I should make . ' Let 's get this straight , ' Ray said . If I do n't see Janet any more , you wo n't go over and tell John Kennedy I ought to be expelled . ' Yes , ' Pauline Maury said . But I do n't mind being expelled , ' Ray said . I 'm not coming back anyhow . And besides , Kennedy probably would n't expel me . ' Pauline Maury stood very straight and held her breath for a moment . Then she let it go . You ? ' she said . I 'm not talking about you . Why should I be talking about you ? What importance could your going or staying have for anyone ? I 'm talking about Janet . '  | Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this time trying to tell you . This matters , do you see ? Janet 's career depends on it . Can you understand this ? There 's a position here which I may be able to get for her , and you can surely see how disastrous it would be for anything of this sort to come to light now . It must not happen , that 's all . ' What kind of a position ? ' Ray said , and Pauline Maury only looked at him , tight-lipped , and then turned to Janet . Come on , ' she said , let 's go . Let 's get away from here . ' Janet stood where she was . She had listened to a lot of words , and now they all ran together and she just stood there and let people say things to her . There 's nothing to worry about , ' Pauline Maury said . You can leave this to me , and it wo n't hurt your chances . ' What chances ? ' Janet said , and Pauline Maury shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how tired she was . Come on , ' she said . I 'll tell you about it tomorrow . ' There was no compulsion in the tone , it was fairly kindly and matter-of-fact , and Janet answered it in the same way . Do n't bother about it , ' she said . I do n't want it . ' You do n't want what ? ' Pauline Maury said . I do n't want John Gordon 's job , ' Janet said . There was a full moment of silence , and then Paul-  | ine Maury spoke up in a voice that was well enough controlled . Are you dreaming ? ' she said , and she smiled a little . What on earth could have made you get such an idea ? ' She stopped and looked at her , very straight , and said , What an absolute gift for fantasy ! ' All right , ' Janet said . But do n't bother , because I do n't want it . ' Why should you stand there like an idiot and keep telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll bother or not as I choose . What is all this about bother ? ' I just do n't want you to , ' Janet said . I do n't want you to pull strings for me , or build me up , or try to sell me to anybody , because I 'm not worth all the trouble . And I do n't want it . ' I can understand , ' Pauline Maury said , how you feel about yourself right now . But that will change . When you leave here , when you wash this off , when you are rested , you 'll begin to know who you are again , and then I may find it possible to talk to you . ' All I 'm saying , ' Janet said , is that I do n't want that job . ' That 's not what you said last night . ' I do n't remember what I said last night . ' And you wo n't remember what you 're saying tonight . ' Yes , I will . I 'll remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Pauline Maury gave her a sharp look . What kind of drivel are you talking ? ' she said .  | Janet said it over again . Her voice was n't firm . I 've changed my mind . I do n't want anything . I do n't want to finish my degree . I do n't want a position . I do n't want to write a book . I do n't want anything . ' She spread her hands out . Not a thing . ' There 's no need to put on one of your acts . Not here , at least . ' It 's not an act , ' Janet said . I mean it . I 'm getting away from here . ' Janet , do n't make a fool of yourself . ' I have to , ' Janet said . I ca n't finish any of that . ' You 're ill . I know the look . I know the symptoms . ' Janet turned and gathered her forces . No , ' she said . You ca n't tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not crazy . I know what I 'm doing , and I 'm going to do it . ' Pauline Maury spoke to her in the tone one uses with the daft or the willful , a kind of mock patience . Of course , ' she said . Of course you 're going to do it . But what is it you 're going to do ? ' Janet tightened her fists and took a breath . I 'm going to get married . ' It was a simple announcement , clearly and formally phrased , but when it was made there was too great a silence , and she burst out to cover it up , to say more , to make comment , to fill in the gap that congratulations should have covered . It 's something people do , that 's all . They want to get married , so they get married . They do it every day . I 'm not the first one that ever got married . It 's all right . It 's just something that happens . '  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yourself , ' she said . It 's just like that . It happens , does n't it ? ' Ray did n't answer . He looked dumbfounded . Here he was , at the eleventh hour , accepted . And in a completely unforeseen way . In spite of everything he blushed . Pauline Maury did n't blush . Her face went white , and it took her a moment to collect herself and ask her question : What kind of stupid joke is this ? ' No , ' Janet said . It 's the truth . Sunday morning . Next Sunday morning early . ' Pauline Maury turned to Ray . Is this the truth ? ' Yes , ' Ray said , and Janet rushed in to back him up . Early Sunday morning , ' she said , and then looked a little limp with nothing to add to it . Pauline Maury pulled her coat tight about her and looked slowly from one to the other of them . I do n't know why I could n't have sensed this , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unwilling to ask me to help you . ' Her voice broke , and she went on in low key . When it 's a question of this sort of thing , I do n't know why it is , but when a young person gets caught in this sort of net the mind somehow ceases to function , and the only alternatives seem to be marriage or suicide . It 's useless to marry under these circumstances . It 's stupid , and blind , and unnecessary . So totally unnecessary . ' She looked at Janet with something like compassion . You need n't have gone through all this by yourself ,  | all the worry and the uncertainty . You should have known I 'd stand by you . I 'll find a doctor . Tomorrow . I 'll go out and find one , and there need n't be any worry about it . ' Janet listened to her , and when it was fully clear what she was talking about , she tried to put her straight . But I 'm not having a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with astonishment . I do n't think so , anyhow , ' Janet said , and she halfturned to Ray and then turned back again . Not that I know of , ' she said . We 're just getting married because we want to . ' Because you want to , ' Pauline Maury said . You are getting married because you want to . And does what I want have nothing to do with it ? Are you so completely thoughtless , so headlong , that you forget all our plans and all our hopes ? Do you forget that I have spent years teaching you everything you know ? how to dress , how to eat , how to drink , how to read , how to write , even how to sit and how to walk ? Do you remember what you were when you came to me ? Do you ? ' She laughed . The corners of her mouth turned up , and then very suddenly went flat in a narrow bitter line , and she looked at her creature with whole contempt . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get mar-ried ? ' Janet put both hands up to her forehead , and then dropped them to her sides , and said , Yes . '  | There 's only one thing to do , ' Pauline Maury said . You must come home now . We 'll talk it over reasonably and you can decide . ' Janet took a quick look at Ray . He was getting ready to say something , and she hurried to speak before he did . I 'll come home later , ' Janet said . I want to stay here for awhile . ' There was dismissal in the tone , and Pauline Maury jerked her head back as if she 'd been struck in the face . Do you imagine for a minute that I intend to go off and leave you in a place like this , now ? And do you think you can make me believe that you really intend to marry this ' ? she looked at Ray , trying to find a way to describe him ? this , this Mr. Mac So and So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Yes , ' Ray said . You heard her . That 's what she intends . ' I heard her , ' said Pauline Maury , and I was not for a second taken in by it . If Janet wants to continue with this kind of affair , there is a course for me to take , and I 'll take it . But right now there is only one thing for me to do , and that is to take her away from here . Can you believe , either of you , that a person of any decency , or delicacy , anyone with any sense of morality , could simply go away and leave her here ? ' I do n't know what you believe , ' Janet said , but I 'm staying here . ' Pauline Maury lost some of her composure . Her voice was at the point of being shrill .  | ' You 're not staying here , ' she said . If you ca n't use any judgment , I must decide for you . ' She caught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't need to remind you , do I , how many times this has happened before ? ' The bolt went home . Janet stood thunderstruck . She turned her head slowly and looked at Ray , and while she watched him , the voice went on . You 're surely not allowing Mr. MacKenzie to believe that this little what-shall-I-call-it is the first of its kind ? ' Janet tried to answer her and could n't . Her face looked sick , and Pauline Maury stared at her for a moment with her mouth slightly curled . You see , ' she said , apparently to Ray , though she did n't look at him . This is what disheartens me . This is what I did not want to speak about . Janet has her ... her flings , with as little conscience and as little remorse as my cat . And then , when it 's over , when she 's tired , it is always for me to come in and smooth things up and relieve her of the consequences . To wash the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her coat closer around her and shuddered slightly , as if she were suddenly cold . I may as well tell you , ' she said , that this is the last time . For me , this is it . I 'm tired , I ca n't stand any more of it . ' She spoke carefully and there was a ring of sincerity to her voice . I mean this , Jan . I really mean this . ' sr ? = . ; ' Her face was serious , looking at Janet , and her  | eyes shone bright with what may have been tears . If they were , they were tears of anger and the anger broke loose when she went on . Why is it always like this ? ' she said . Why must it always be something so common and mean and sickening as this ? ' Janet Logan was tasting poison , and it spread through her and numbed her , so that she could n't answer the woman , nor move back from her , nor strike out , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? ' Ray said to her , and the question set her back on her feet and gave her her voice . I do n't know , ' she said . And I do n't think she does . ' Oh ? ' said Pauline Maury . What are you doing here ? ' Ray said direct to Pauline Maury . I 'm trying , Mr. MacKenzie , to keep Janet from making a complete and utter fool of herself . ' By marrying me ? ' Ray said . She wo n't marry you . ' She turned to Janet . Tell him the truth . You do n't have any intention of marrying him , do you ? ' Janet drew back , raised her eyes and looked at Pauline Maury , standing there bent toward her with this question . Yes , ' Janet said . I told you before . It 's what we 're going to do . ' She looked at Ray , a little scared , and almost pleading . Are n't we ? ' she said . Do you still want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said . He turned to Pauline Maury . But what have you got to do with it ? What 's all the stuff about all the men , and all the affairs ? I 'm the one that knows about that . You do n't . ' I 'm not here to argue with you , Mr. MacKenzie . I told you what I know and what I intend to do . And I must ask you not to take this tone with me . ' She turned away from him , and her voice was sharp , speaking to Janet . I 've had enough , do you hear . Stop this senseless game . It does n't deceive me . ' She walked across the room , and stood close to Janet , and went into French , very fast French , and began again , and for the last time to tell her to stop this , to be done with it , to get her coat , now , this minute , and come away from this place . Because if this were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyrrhus , and the two of them , teacher and student , would pay for it in loss of respect , and in loss of everything else important to them . I do n't know , ' Janet said . I ca n't do it any more . I 've got to leave . ' Pauline Maury heard her , but she did n't stop talking . She kept on trying , in French that shot out in jets . She was talking furiously when she happened to look down and see the orchid . It was lying on the desk , still firm , still beautiful , with a lead-foil cap on the stem , and the pin beside it , and when she saw it , she stopped talking , full stop , and stared at it a moment , and took a quick look at the shoulder of Janet 's  | dress , and then looked at it again and reached her hand out toward it . The top of the desk was messy . There were papers on it , and an ashtray filled with stubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and photographic equipment , and all the photographs of Janet , and lying among them , the orchid . She picked it up , and turned it between her fingers , and the lacquered nails flashed bright against the clear green of the stem and the dull gray of the leadfoil . You did n't want it ? ' she said . She kept turning it in her hand . Janet looked frightened , and her voice was shaky when she spoke . I just took it off , ' she said . I was afraid it would wilt . ' Beautiful , ' Pauline Maury said , looking at it . She picked up the pin . Here , ' she said . I 'll put it on you . It wo n't wilt . ' Janet shrank back , as if she were afraid of the pin , and when Pauline Maury came closer to her , she stepped two or three steps away from her , and stood looking as if she were going to run . I do n't want it on , ' she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . I do n't want it . I told you . I 'm not going with you . I 'm not going . Stay away from me . ' She was standing in one spot , but rocking back and forth from one foot to the other , as if she were n't sure which direction she might decide to take . But Pauline did n't try again to put it on her . She  | only stood very quietly where she was , looking at the orchid and turning it on its stem . She was standing between Ray and Janet . They were both watching her , and as they watched , she split the orchid down the center , tore out the cup , and threw all the pieces on the floor . Then she went across the room to the door , opened it , and walked out . The spicy scent stayed long after she had gone , long after the sound of the steps slapping down the hall , and the outer door closing , and the car door banging , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ray , stayed exactly as they had been when she left . They did n't look at each other or say anything until the car was out of hearing , but when they could n't hear it any more , they began to relax . Janet went and sat down , all saggy , on a corner of the couch , propped her chin on her hands , and looked down at the floor . Her knees were together and her toes were pointed in . The elegance was gone . She looked small and all huddled up , like a lost and hungry child sitting down on the curb until something turns up . Ray went to the desk and looked at the twisted cigarette package . The enamel case was gone . No cigarettes . He took his pipe , put a finger in the bowl , and then lighted it without filling it , and went over and stood beside Janet and looked down at her , and said , Hey , we 're engaged . ' Janet did n't look up , but she held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Congratulations . '  | I do n't think your friend approves of me , ' Ray said . No , she does n't approve of much of anything . ' She seemed to want you to go home with her . ' Yes , she certainly seemed to . ' But you 're still here . ' What 's left of me . I suppose I should have gone . ' I dislike your friend . ' Yes . I see what you mean . ' Why ? Do you dislike her too ? ' Ray said , and Janet suddenly looked up at him and tears spilled out of her eyes . Do you want to know how much I hate her ? ' she said . I pray for her to die , because I have n't got the nerve to kill her . ' Ray 's eyes opened wide , and Janet went on talking in the same way , fast and low and out of control . She wo n't die , of course . She 'll live to be a thousand and probably I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't live . I ca n't , that 's all . I ca n't stand it . ' She stopped abruptly , and put her hands over her face , and Ray looked down at her , puzzled . Why did n't you tell me this before ? ' he said . I thought you thought she was wonderful . ' There is n't any way to do anything about it . I do n't think there 's any way at all . It 's all I think about , every damned minute . ' She stopped again , and shivered . Then she pulled the backs of her hands across her eyes , to wipe the tears away , and stood up , and straightened her dress , and looked at Ray . She stood close to him , and looked into his face with the look of a beggar asking for a dime.  | Did you mean it about Mexico ? ' she said . Will you let me go with you ? ' Ray looked back at her , very curiously . I asked you , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for ? ' Ca n't I look- at you ? ' Yes , go ahead and look . But tell me something . Could I go with you ? Could we go right now ? Right tonight ? Just walk out of here and go to Mexico and never come back . Right now ? ' No . ' Why not ? ' Because we ca n't . How 'd we go ? ' How do I know ? Just go . Go to this San Miguel place , only now instead of later . ' Ray shook his head . It has to be lined up . ' Janet turned away from him , and her voice was small . I suppose it does , ' she said . Everything has to be lined up , if it 's going to work out . There 's nothing , there 's no other way to do it , is there ? ' We can do it in June when my job starts . ' But that 's no good , ' Janet said . If I do n't get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Why ? What 's the matter ? ' She 'll find a way to stop me . I do n't know how , but she 'll do it . ' Maury ? ' Yes . ' What 's she got to do with it ? ' She 's got everything to do with it . '  | You told her we were getting married . ' I know . But that wo n't make any difference . She 's there waiting for me , and if I go back , I do n't know what will happen . I ca n't go back . ' What kind of a woman is she ? ' Ray said . Where does she come in ? Why did she come here tonight ? ' She came to make me go home . ' You knew she was coming , did n't you ? ' Ray said , and Janet gave him a look that said , What do you think I am , crazy ? You said you thought somebody might come in on us , and you would n't let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Janet looked puzzled and answered slowly . I did n't know she knew anything about you , ' she said . But I knew something was going to go wrong , somehow . You see , something happened last night . I made her very angry . ' She waited a minute , as if trying to decide how to tell it . Then she went over to the desk , pulled the chair away , and sat down on the desk . She had her arms braced at her sides , and she looked constantly down at the floor . I told you most of it before , ' she said . She found out about her promotion , and she had to celebrate , so we celebrated . She was very happy , and nobody in the world can be so happy as she gets when she 's happy . She was all high and full of plans for the rest of her life , and for the rest of mine too ? books we were going to write and things we were going to do . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and plan ,  | because I did n't feel like throwing any cold water on her when she 'd just been promoted . ' She stopped , and seemed lost , and Ray had to tell her to go ahead . I do n't think I should have kept still , ' she said , but I did , because I did n't want to jar anything . I felt comfortable for a minute , and the champagne was good , and Pauline was in a good humor , and I just let it go and listened to her have ideas . She was having them three at a time . One thing I remember she was going to do was adopt a Chinese baby and have George start teaching it to cook when it was three and see if maybe it would n't turn out to be a culinary genius . And she had some good ideas for me too , but I do n't think she settled on any one , finally . I was just going to be generally successful , and she could n't make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , but the main thing was that it was pleasant . For once there did n't seem to be any strain , and after she opened the second bottle of champagne I even got to the point of playing the piano . I do n't know how it happened . You should n't play the piano in an apartment house at four in the morning , and I ca n't remember whether Pauline asked me to play or whether I just felt like it , or what , but I played . I must have played for a long time , too , all through the second bottle , because when I quit , finally , everything went out on me . I stood up and pushed the bench back and started across the room , and fainted . ' Champagne , ' Ray said .  | Maybe , ' Janet said , but this happened fast . One minute I was all right enough to play the piano , and then all of a sudden my head whirled , and the lights went out and I fell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , Pauline had me laid out on the sofa , and she was sitting beside me holding a brandy snifter under my nose . ' My God , did you drink that too ? ' I do n't know . But Pauline was scared , and she immediately figured it out that I 'd been working too hard and not getting enough rest , and what she 'd do would be to cut her Friday classes and we 'd leave tonight after the tea and go to Carmel for three days . ' She stopped and shivered . Cold ? ' No , ' Janet said . I was just thinking I suppose I should have said yes , and then none of this would have happened . But I could n't do it . I could n't stay away for three days , and I did n't know whether I could even find you today and tell you I had to go . All I could think of was you sitting here tonight waiting for me and me not showing up , and all the time Pauline was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd take and when we 'd leave and where we 'd stay . I do n't think I 've ever seen her look so happy ; and I knew I 'd say what I had to say , and I knew what would happen when I did . ' She stopped , and shook her head . It was bad . It was the way I knew it would be . I told her I could n't go , and I watched her face change until I was scared to death of it . And then she began  | to talk . She began to say things , and it went on the rest of the night , that voice telling me . I 'll never stop hearing it . ' Ray looked at her , puzzled . I do n't see why you let her get under your skin , ' he said . What is she ? nothing but a sort of a goodlooking clotheshorse little pipsqueak of a schoolteacher . What could she do to you anyhow ? Flunk you ? Throw you out of a job you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . That would be fine , but I knew it would be worse than , that . I knew last night that she 'd find out about you sooner or later . She 'd find out about you and come here and raise hell with us . ' Did n't you ever tell her about me ? ' . No . ' Why not ? Is something wrong with me ? ' No . But I just did n't want her to know you . ' Because I worked for her that time . ' No , just because I wanted to keep you out of it . ' Out of what ? ' Out of the mess , out of the godawful mess I 'm in . ' Ray grinned . You mean with all those fellows you 're always sleeping with ? Why do you suppose she wanted to tell me that ? ' She thought you 'd believe it . ' Maybe I should n't have refuted her so sort of authoritatively . ' Why not ? You 're the authority . I was glad you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then why did you look so scared when I said it ? ' Janet closed her eyes a minute . I did n't want her to get stirred up and start saying the kind of things she said last night . ' Was she worse last night than she was here ? ' Oh , God . I 'll never get over it . ' There was a silence while Ray thought this over . He looked down at Janet . She was sitting on the corner , of the couch . Her head was bowed , and there was a vein that showed clearly along the edge of her cheek , like a blue pencil mark . He looked down at her and spoke slowly . I do n't get it very clear about Iast night , ' he said . The first time you told it it was all champagne and speeches and you had such a big time you forgot to go to bed . You did n't say anything about a fight . ' I did n't feel like telling about it . ' Then why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , ' Janet said . She looked down at the floor and there was the orchid , torn and scattered , and she got up , absent-mindedly , and began picking up the pieces , making order . Why did she give you that ? ' ' Janet went ahead picking up pieces and dropping them into the wastebasket . To wear to the tea . ' Does she always give you an orchid to wear to her teas ? ' ' Yes . ' You did n't have one on the time I was there . '  | I know it . But this one was the last for the year . ' It does n't make sense . You say she always gives you an orchid . Then you say she only gives you one to wear to the last tea of the year . ' All right , ' Janet said . Sometimes she does ; sometimes she does n't . ' Depending on whether you 're in good with her or not . ' I guess so . ' So last night you had a hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchid . ' Janet did n't say anything , and Ray went on . And tonight she comes in here and tries to make me feel like a bellhop or somebody you just picked up for the fun of it . What about it , anyhow ? ' Janet looked up at him . I do n't care what you think about her , ' she said , but let 's not let this happen . Please let 's not . ' Let 's not what ? ' We 're fighting , are n't we ? You 're getting sore . ' No , I 'm not . ' Janet looked at him . Her face was very clear , and her eyes were wide , and she made her honest plea . We 've got to watch it , ' she said , and never start fighting . Because it 's the worst thing that can happen . It 's poison . It 's a disease that gets people . They start trying to hurt each other and there 's never any end to it . Once it starts they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . ' You ought to know . ' I do know . '  | Do you spend your time getting knives into each other ? ' No ; it 's lopsided . She does it . ' Why do n't you fight back ? ' Janet thought about it . I 'm not a fighter , ' she said . When anybody raises a voice , or even an eyebrow , at me I get weak . I want to crawl away . ' And she likes it , does n't she ? I should have been polite and crawled a little when she was here . ' It would n't do for me to speak up to her , anyhow , ' Janet said . She knows too much about me . ' What 's she know about you that I do n't know ? ' She knows everything that 's wrong with me . She 's taken care of me for four years . ' Why did you let her ? That 's what I ca n't figure . ' Janet waited and thought about it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that sanitarium business , and never told anybody about it , and never held it against me . ' No , ' Ray said , but she tried to make you think it was a lot worse than it was . Even tonight she had to work on you about it . ' No , I do n't think so , ' Janet said . She 's still worried about it . And she knows what it was . She does n't want me to know . She was there the whole time . She got the doctor and handled the whole thing . ' Sure she did , ' Ray said , and she 's sorry as hell you 're not having a baby now , so she could handle everything again , and find you another doctor . She likes to get doctors . It 's what she likes best . '  | I do n't know . ' Well , I know . It was sticking out all over when she was here tonight . Her whole idea is to get something on you so you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of it , ' Janet said . Why ? That 's what I ca n't figure . Why did you take it ? ' I do n't know . I was there and I could n't get out . ' She waited a minute , and then she said : Until you came along there was n't any reason . I 've got to get out now , because I 've got to be with you . ' She stopped a moment and Ray started to say something , but she cut in on him : She 'll try every kind of thing to stop us . Tonight was only the beginning . ' To hell with her , ' Ray said , and then he stopped very suddenly almost as if someone had poked , him and pointed to something . When he spoke again he did n't quite know what he was going to say and he had to look around for the words . If I did n't know you so well , I 'd think there was something pretty fancy going on . ' Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd think you were having an affair . ' Janet turned and looked at him . There was a frown between her eyes and her face was twisted . Do n't get sore , ' Ray said . I did n't say I thought you were . I said if I did n't know you so well I 'd think you were . ' Janet 's voice was cold . But you do n't think so ? ' What 's the matter with you ? ' I want to know what you think . Go ahead , tell me. '  | Ray looked at her and held his hand out toward her and touched the vein on her cheek . Who 's fighting ? ' he said , and he saw that the look on her face did n't change , and he went on : Listen to me , you . When we 're together I know where we stand . When we 're together I know you do n't belong to any man or any woman but me , see , and I know it . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head but with your blood . ' Janet put her hands over her face a minute , and then she straightened up and looked at him . Remember that , will you ? ' she said . Will you please remember that ? ' What 's the matter ? ' I 've tried to tell you this fifty times , but every time I lost my nerve when it came to saying it . ' Ray narrowed his eyes a little and waited . I started to tell you again tonight , ' Janet said , and then I could n't stand to , because I could n't take a chance on having you change your mind about me . ' She looked up into his face as if she were trying to read the future . Then she swallowed a couple of times and spoke out . That 's how it 's been , ' she said . I 've lived with her . ' She closed her eyes after she said it , as if the relief of having said it were enormous , and when she opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists were tight and his knuckles were big . What do you mean lived with her ? Do you mean you 're in love with her ? '  | I hate her , ' Janet said . You know I hate her . ' I do n't know anything . ' He put his hands in his pockets and bowed his head . I do n't understand , ' he said , how this can be . ' I do n't either , ' Janet said . I never have . ' He looked at her and twisted his mouth , and she spoke up quickly . That 's the truth . I do n't know how I got into it , or how it happened . All I know is that I 've lived through three godawful years of it , and it 's driving me crazy . ' Ray walked across the room and stood at the window . The blind was drawn , but he looked at it exactly as if he were watching things happening on the street . Janet stood up too and went to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't love her , ' she said . I never loved her . ' No , you just stuck around for three years because you hated her . ' Listen to me , ' Janet said . I stayed three years because I could n't get out . The night I met you , when we were leaving there you said something like that . Do you remember ? We were going down the back stairs , and you stopped and slapped the wall and said it reminded you of the Richmond jail . It reminded me more of Alcatraz . ' Ray turned suddenly and faced her . Do n't give me any more of that , ' he said . Nobody goes into Alcatraz of his own free will . You wanted to go to her , or you never would have gone . ' All right , ' Janet said . I wanted to go . But I did n't know what it was . Did you ever admire any-  | body ? Did n't you ever know anyone older than you who seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes , you have . Everybody has . ' Sure . But you do n't have to go live with everybody you admire . ' I went to live with her because she asked me to , and when I first knew her I 'd have done anything she asked me to . I did n't know there was anything wrong with it or with her . And the whole thing was so mixed up with everything else I liked and was just finding out about , like poetry and music and pictures . ' Did you ever hear of a fairy that was n't artistic ? ' Ray said . The main thing wrong with the arts is that they attract so many degenerates . ' Is that what you 're calling me ? ' Why not ? ' He looked at her as if he did n't know her , and she backed away from him almost as if he were holding a gun on her . Her voice was small , but she made herself speak . You 've never understood why I would n't marry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry you until I could make myself tell you this . And I knew it would be this way if I did tell you . ' What did you expect ? ' I expected this , and that 's why I would n't tell you . I could n't ever make up my mind to break my life to pieces . Because , listen , with you out of it it 's to pieces , that 's all . ' Thanks . '  | You 're welcome . ' Ray turned away and looked at the window blind again , and Janet came up behind him and made another try . An hour ago , ' she said , you loved me ; you wanted to marry me and spend the rest of your life with me . Well , I 'm no different now from what I was then . Turn around , wo n't you ? ' Why ? ' We 've got to talk . We 've got to try to get this straight . ' Ray turned around . He looked tired . All right , talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand it if it had been a man ? ' she said . If I 'd got mixed up with an older man , somebody I admired , somebody I thought was a wonderful writer , and I 'd gone all through this with him , and got caught in it and could n't get out when I knew it was all wrong ? If it had been that way you 'd probably have helped me , would n't you ? You 'd probably have said I was unlucky , or halfbaked , but if we 'd met each other and if we 'd known we belonged together , we 'd have done something about it , and you 'd have stayed by me . Would n't you ? ' Ray looked at her . I do n't know what I 'd do , ever , about anything . Except get hooked by a phony . ' Janet turned on him . Do n't talk . Do n't say things you do n't mean . I do n't belong anywhere but with you . You know it and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  | The hell I 'm not . ' You could n't be . ' I was so mixed up before I knew you I did n't know what I was . But now I know . I 'm all right , I 'm not worrying about me . I 'm what I am , and you know everything there is to know about what I am . ' Ray twisted his mouth . Yes , ' he said . Oh , yes , indeed . ' Ca n't you see this ? ' Janet said . I had to tell you . Do n't think I liked it , living there in that glass house . Do n't think I stayed there because I wanted to . I tried to get away the first year , and she caught me and brought me back , and then she went to work on me , and I cracked up and had to be taken to the sanitarium . And after that she had me , because she made me know I could never hold a job or earn a living except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then is hang on to myself and make the best of it . ' Ray looked at her . It 's funny , ' he said . It 's almost funny , the way it got me to know you were the only girl I 'd ever had that had n't slept with ten other guys before I ever met her . Is n't it sort of funny ? ' No , it 's not funny , and it 's true . I 've never known anyone but you in my life . You 're the only one I can talk to , or think about , or even look at . I do n't know anybody in the world but you , and I never want to know anyone else . ' Ray heard it and his mouth twisted , and his fists went tight , and he looked at her steadily for a long time . Janet looked up and met his eyes , and they  | stood this way , looking at each other across the three feet of space that separated them . They stood rigid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mouth trembled and his eyes got wet , and he turned away violently , and threw himself face down on the couch , with his head in his arms , and wept . Janet stood where she was and watched him . She rubbed her head with the backs of her hands and started moving toward him . When she came to the couch she stood and looked down at his back and heard the sound of his crying . Then she let herself drop down beside him . Do n't , darling , ' she said . Please do n't . ' She felt him twitch when she touched him , and then she heard his voice , muffled but strong . Take your lousy mitts off me , and get out of our house . ' Janet jumped , and pulled her hands back , and sat still a minute and then stood up . Ray did n't move . He kept his head in his arms , and his shoulders jerked . Janet 's coat was on a chair beside the door . She went and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then turned back and looked around the room ? at the desk and the pictures and the phonograph , and at the couch with the boy sprawled on it . Then she put the other arm in the other sleeve , and turned the knob and opened the door and closed it behind her .  | BOOK THREE OUTSIDE IT WAS COLD , AND JANET Logan turned up the collar of her coat , put her hands in her pockets , and walked back , slowly , the way she had come . The streets were quiet , and the fog had come in , low and wet , thick enough to blur the street lights . The coffee shops in the block below the campus were still open , and she turned into one of them and got a package of cigarettes and sat down at the counter to open them . The mirror across the fountain from her repeated the line and movement of it ? a girl in a black coat with the collar up and her hair whirling out over it , opening a package of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleepy two-yearold trying hard to untie a knot in a shoelace . Back on the street she stood for a while on the street corner , aimless . She held a cigarette in one hand , and with the other she held her collar tight around her neck . Her hair looked white under the street light , and she stood huddled and shivering . In another  | place she might have been someone for the police to look into , but university towns are accustomed to attitudes of dejection and aimlessness , day or night , indoors or out , and nobody noticed her . She stayed where she was , unquestioned , and when she had come to a decision , she dropped the cigarette into the gutter , set herself in the direction of the hilly part of town , and kept moving . She cut through the campus again , same route , first along the main avenue that passed between library and the law buildings , and then along the path through the grove . The fog was dripping off the leaves of the eucalyptus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head down , and walked faster and a little unevenly , the heels again , until she came to the fence , the upper barrier of the campus . Then she climbed through the bars , and stopped and leaned back against a post and caught her breath . The Piedmont was at the end of the second block above the campus . It was a big building , a showplace , and the moon caught it , up on the hill above the fog , and made it shine . It had a curving glassbrick front , very slick and cold , all constructed of ice cubes , but there were lights inside , indication that it was habitable , and Janet Logan , standing at the foot of the hill looking up at it , could see the windows , and the decks , and the curving walk up to the main entrance . It was real , up there above the fog . People could walk up the hill and open the door and go inside ; and inside they could eat and sleep and drink and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fencepost , and  | crossed the street , and began to climb the hill . She went slowly , taking her time , and she kept her eyes on the Piedmont as she walked toward it . Almost at the end of the second block she turned off and took the curving walk to the entrance and pushed open the big glass door and went into the entrance hall where the mailboxes and the doorbells were . She took a look into the box marked Maury-Logan , ' and then walked up the two steps to the other , inside , door , found her key , unlocked it and pushed it open . It was warm inside , and she turned down her collar and unbuttoned her coat while she walked the length of the hall to the elevator . The elevator was very smooth and metallic , a little upright chromium box with a panel of four pearl buttons on the wall . She pushed the fourth button , and when the elevator began to pull her up , she said , Oh , God , ' out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of tremendous importance to her , the framed instructions for the operation of elevators . She was reading the last of the instructions , which went , When leaving car , close car gate and landing door , otherwise elevator becomes inoperative , ' when she realized that the elevator had stopped , that it was time to get out , and she slid back the double doors and got out , saying , apparently to the elevator : Do n't let yourself become inoperative . It 's the worst thing that can happen . ' She stood where she was , feeling in pockets for her key , and looking down the hall at a door , number seventeen , which she would open . When she had found the key , she held it in her hand and walked down the hall , and when she came to  | the door she did n't hesitate . She shoved the key into the lock and turned it . It was then that she hesitated . There were voices coming from inside the room , a heavy voice and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lock without opening the door . She stood very still , as if by her stillness to annul the small leaden sound the key had made , but the sound had got through the voices , and Pauline Maury herself was at the door to see what was happening . Her face was white , almost entirely colorless and without expression , when she opened the door , but when she saw Janet , she drew her breath quickly and the color shot up along the edges of her cheeks , and she stepped out into the hall to meet her . Oh , thank God , ' she said , almost in a whisper . She took her by the arm and started to bring her inside , and when she touched her coat , she stopped and said : How in the world did you get so wet ? Is it raining ? ' I do n't think so , ' Janet said . I just came back for some things . ' She said it stiffly , and Pauline Maury stepped back and her face went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no , ' and shook her head in a way that was all contrition and apology . Come in , ' she said . She took her by the arm again and led her into the room , and as they entered she talked a little more clearly , to be heard . The man inside was John Kennedy , and it was for him that she was talking .  | This child , ' she said , has no sense of keys and no sense of weather . She invariably goes out with the wrong key and the wrong coat . ' She turned to Janet . Take it off , right now . ' She helped Janet take the coat off and took it and threw it across a chair beside the door . John Kennedy stood up , and Janet went forward and shook his hand . Neither of them gave out much in the way of social warmth . Kennedy looked preoccupied , and so did Janet ; and as soon as they had clasped hands , Janet started edging off toward the study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Pauline Maury said . There 's nothing private about this . ' There was something peculiar about the way she said it . She looked obliquely at Kennedy . He seemed uncomfortable . The chair he was sitting in was too small for him , and he uncrossed his legs and crossed them the other way , before he spoke . I should have thought there was , ' he said . Yes , ' Pauline Maury said . I suppose there is , but surely the accused can be allowed to have a confidante . ' And without saying anything else to him , she turned to Janet and said , This gentleman has been bringing the most horrible accusations against me . ' She looked at Janet to see what the effect was , and the effect was made , clearly enough . The tone was light but the words themselves bore it down and drove it home . Janet looked quickly at Kennedy and then at Pauline Maury , and put out a hand and took hold of the back of a chair to steady herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stood in front of the fireplace , with her back against the mantel and both arms stretched out along it . She was dressed as she had been at Ray 's , except that she no longer wore the coat , and her body , very slim and small , with the arms stretched out , took on the shape of a cross . She let Kennedy do the talking . You do n't think I wrote the letter , do you ? ' he said . Pauline Maury smiled . No , but you brought it . ' It 's addressed to you . There was a note clipped to the top : " Copy for John R. Kennedy , Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science , " but the salutation is straight to you : My dear Miss Maury . ' My very very dear Miss Maury , ' Pauline said . It 's a pretty convention , is n't it , the small tenderness that comes at the top of a scurrilous letter ? ' She looked at Janet with a look of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak up , to ask a question , but she did n't do it . She held herself stiff and heard the talk back and forth , buzzing sounds with no meaning . And then a meaning came through . Someone has written to John to inform him that I stole most of the material for my book . That I did not , in brief , write my own book . ' She gave so much information to Janet , and then turned to Kennedy with a question . And what does that make me ? a plagiarizer ? a plagiarist ? ' No , ' Kennedy said . But if the man wants to insist on it , it might make you a libel suit . '  | Janet came around the side of the chair and sat down on the arm of it . Her eyes were wide . She looked at Pauline Maury , all mystified , all mixed up , and then she asked the questions . But what is it ? What 's the matter ? ' Pauline Maury raised her shoulders and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and Kennedy did the best he could . There was a letter , he said . It had come to his office with the afternoon mail , and it was signed by a man named Paul Blanchard , who claimed to have evidence that all the sections of Miss Maury 's book which had to do with the criticism and analysis of poetry had been lifted verbatim and in toto from the unpublished manuscript of a doctoral dissertation on file in the library of the University of Grenoble , and of which he himself possessed another copy . At least two copies of the manuscript existed , the man said , and any similarity between it and Miss Maury 's book , could not , on such a large scale , be coincidental . The only difference between the manuscript and the book was a matter of translation . The original was written in French , and Miss Maury 's published version had put it into English . And the man intended to publish this discovery unless Miss Maury were willing to withdraw her book from publication . Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she jumped up , and shook her head . He must be crazy , ' she said . I think so too , ' Kennedy said , and Pauline Maury looked from one of them to the other , gratefully and  | with tenderness . The three of them were quiet , thinking it over ? Janet and Kennedy angry and perturbed , and Pauline Maury , on her feet before them , standing straight and serene . Why did n't he send the letter to you ? ' Janet said , and Pauline Maury smiled vaguely and said , That 's one of the unknowns . ' You 'll get one , ' Kennedy said . He does n't mean to leave you out . ' He reached into his inside coat pocket and brought forth the letter . It was in a long business envelope , and there were three closely typewritten pages of it , with a note clipped to the first page . Kennedy looked through it again , and his face as he read became more and more puzzled . What does he mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he want to remind me of anything ? I do n't even know who he is , or anything about him . ' He looked up at Pauline Maury . Do you have any idea what it could mean ? ' he said , and without waiting for an answer , he put the letter a little farther away from him , looked hard at it , and began to read . " If it should occur to you to wonder why I take such a particular interest in this matter , and why I so stubbornly intend to see justice done , perhaps I should remind you that Claire Blanchard , the author of the original study , was my wife . " And it is signed Paul Blanchard , 87 Crandal Street , New York . ' He put the letter down on the coffee table beside him , and filled his pipe from a pouch . Janet looked down at the letter .  | May I see it ? ' she said . Kennedy nodded , and she picked it up , a little gingerly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fast , as if to find out whether the things she had been hearing were really to be found there . She shook her head as she read , and when she had had enough , she looked up at Pauline Maury , and said , Did you ever hear of him ? ' Pauline Maury raised her shoulders , complete ignorance , and said : Never in my life . And what could he be ? With a name like that he might be French , or he might be English . And with that for an address he could be anything ? teacher , writer , insurance solicitor , jockey ' ? and she raised her hands to indicate the infinity of things a man named Paul Blanchard of New York could be . I think he 's a teacher , ' Kennedy said . There 's something stilted about the way he writes . ' He stopped and thought , and said , But there 's nothing very stilted about what he says . ' Pauline Maury smiled . No , nothing at all . ' Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kennedy put it into the envelope and put it back in his pocket . Did you ever hear of anyone named Claire Blanchard ? ' he said , and Pauline Maury said no , no Paul Blanchard , and no Claire Blanchard , and no Blanche Blanchard , in fact no Blanchard whatever in all of her fully-peopled life . Janet had gone back to the chair and she was sitting on the arm again . Her head was bowed and she looked tired and all but asleep , perched there in her  | smooth black dress with the little string of pearls around her neck , and her hair all uncombed and pushed around . Then very suddenly she raised her head . Wait . I think I 've heard of Claire Blanchard , ' she said . Her eyes widened , and she looked at Pauline Maury , a little puzzled , and said : Have n't I ? Was n't there someone named Claire Blanchard ? ' Someone you know ? ' Pauline Maury said , and Janet looked at her , still puzzled , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she shook her head . No , I guess not . I was thinking of someone else . ' But who ? ' Pauline Maury said , and the two of them looked at each other a moment , and then Janet shook her head again , and said : No . I was thinking of somebody I knew in school . ' Pauline Maury took a breath and looked at Dean Kennedy , and when she looked back at Janet she smiled , and with the smile she opened her mouth and showed her little white teeth and began to laugh in the pure clear tones of a laugh on a stage ? the laugh of someone who really knows how to laugh . It 's mad , ' she said . The whole thing is a fantasy or a nightmare , something terribly funny and completely unreal . Something that twists around and has no front and no back , no beginning and no end . Does n't it seem that way to you ? ' John Kennedy turned in his little chair and chewed on his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did , but it does n't . ' He put his hand in his inside pocket , as if to check his proofs . The letter was there , real enough . The thing I ca n't understand , ' he said , is why he wanted to send a copy to me . What do I have to do with it ? I do n't know who he is or what he 's talking about , and I do n't see where I come into it , or how . ' Pauline Maury thought it over a minute , and then she said : I do n't find that so difficult . He wrote to you because you 're in a position to discharge me . You 're as high as he could go . ' She stopped short and went on more slowly , thinking it out as she went . I think you 're right about his being a teacher , ' she said . A layman wanting to discredit me would have written to the President . ' She moved her hands away from the mantel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist with the other hand and went on . It wo n't be hard to find out who Paul Blanchard is . His name will be in one of the catalogues of one of the colleges or universities in New York , probably a little one . But his name will be there with all the other names . Instructor in French , with a future unlimited . He 'll make his name known , and he 'll do it in all the small ways he knows . He 'll write letters to people like you about people like me . And he 'll keep his own work free from any upsetting ideas , and completely harmless . He 'll never challenge anyone who can help him along , and there 's no doubt about it , he 'll get along . '  | She began to slide her hand up and down her bare arm as if to warm herself . I know this man well , ' she said , whether his name is Paul Blanchard or John Gordon or Richard Roe . And I do n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that I want to be part of a kind of life that has so many of him in it . ' What 's wrong with John Gordon ? ' Kennedy said , a little puzzled , and Pauline Maury looked puzzled too , and said : John Gordon ? Did I say John Gordon ? ' I thought so , ' Kennedy said . It was a slip , then . John Gordon most certainly would never do anyone any harm . And he 'll never do either himself or the teaching profession any good , do you think ? ' She seemed to be asking for information , and Kennedy thought about it , and said : I do n't know . I think he 's a pretty good teacher , is n't he ? ' Possibly so , ' Pauline Maury said . It 's possible that he interests his students . But what has he done since he was made an instructor here ? It 's three years now , you know . He 's had one promotion , but what has he really accomplished ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't half finished . As far as I know , no one 's even seen the book . I 've tried to help him . I 've done everything I could to try to make him actually do something ? some one thing to prove that he has a real interest in the department and in what we 're trying to do . But he has n't done it . So far as I can judge , the only things he 's done are to get married and have a baby . '  | Kennedy heard this and looked worried , and Pauline Maury 's tone changed . I do n't know why I should concern myself about John , ' she said . It is n't John that 's wrong . I think he 's possibly right in treating the whole thing lightly . What on earth 's the use of trying to save it ? The academic world is dead on its feet , and it 's on its way to becoming as outworn and as useless to society as the church . Think about it . Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lectures of learned men , and the learned men 's lectures are repetitions , almost invariably , of the misinformation of the ages . There 's a tradition , iron-bound , of handing down mistakes in precisely their original form . The students memorize these , and education goes on , all unhampered by any upsetting or original thinking . ' She was stirred up , and her voice flowed out , controlled but biting . Do you really believe that ? ' Kennedy said . Pauline Maury waited a moment before she answered . When she spoke , there was a note of resignation in her voice . I never believed it before , ' she said , but I do now . It 's the only thing I can believe . You see , I 've fought . I 've tried to keep it alive , because I love teaching , and because I love literature . I 'm interested in these things , I 'm bound up with them , they 're my whole life and I 've tried to do the very best I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of platitudes that careful , dogged scholars throw around the truth . That 's what I hoped to do in my own book . I worked  | only with what I knew , with what I could trust , and what I found to be true I put down . I refused to gloss over what was unsavory in the lives of the poets I dealt with , and I did n't worry about what the effect would be . I only wanted to say , for once , what these men really were , and to try to rid the world of a lot of stupid and evangelistic notions about literature . And now , ' she said , very quietly , there has come to your office a letter to discount my book and to discount me . It 's strange to think so , but I believe that letter was inevitable . If a man named whatever it is ? Paul Blanchard ? ? had n't written it , a man named something else would . ' She looked around her , at Janet sitting there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at Kennedy , frowning . While she was watching him , Kennedy stood up and walked a couple of paces , and sat down on the sofa , opposite Janet . He made a little throat-clearing noise before he started to speak , and then he went slowly , always feeling forward for the words . Your book , ' he said , did us a great deal of honor , and I do n't believe there 's any doubt about it , it has done more for the reputation of the university than anything any faculty member has published for a long time . And there 's no doubt about it , either , that your promotion was a direct result of it . ' He stopped and looked puzzled , as if he 'd forgotten what he was going to say , and then he remembered . But as I understand this letter , the man who wrote it has no objections to the parts of the book you have  | been talking about . He 's not concerning himself with the lives , the biographical sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . May I see the letter again ? ' Kennedy took the letter out of the envelope and stood up and took it to her , and she looked through it , and stopped to read one section carefully . Then she slapped the pages with the back of her hand and folded the letter and handed it to Kennedy . You 're right , ' she said . It 's not the biographies he 's objecting to . He says only that they are sensational and worthless . ' She walked back and stood as she had been standing , on the stone hearth of the fireplace , with her back to the shelf of the black mantel ; and standing there in her bright-striped tunic , with her feet slightly apart and the tips of her sandals showing under the edge of the long flowing skirt , and her arms held at her sides , and her sharp , black-haired head flung back a little , with dignity and defiance , she had the look of Jeanne d'Arc facing her questioners . No , ' she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the lonely and difficult thing of finishing a book ? There 's not much incentive to work . One writes the best book one can , and what does it come to ? You see , it 's not easy . Janet can tell you it was n't simple for me to write that book . She was with me when I wrote it , she read it chapter by chapter , page by page , as I was writing it . She saw it come together , and she knows what it was for me to do it . ' She looked at Janet and Janet did not look up . She kept her head bowed .  | I did it on my own time , ' Pauline Maury went on , in any odd moments I could spare from my teaching . I worked at night , after I 'd prepared my lectures . I do n't know when I slept , I do n't quite know how I kept going , or how I managed to get it done at all . ' She caught her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to say what can drive you to forget everything else but an idea you want to express . But I suppose finally one writes because one cares ? because the thing itself is what matters . I know I did n't care how much of myself I spent , or how much of pleasure I missed , if I could only do my work and say the things I believed . That was all I felt . But what was the good ? If you write a book that is worthy of any consideration at all , it either inspires jealousy or slander on the part of your colleagues and contemporaries . They 're none of them interested in it as a book , as something you 've had to say , but only as a personal thrust at them , because you 're at variance with their opinions , or because you were first to say what one of them might have thought of sooner or later and said for himself . ' John Kennedy looked increasingly troubled as she talked . Do you feel that anyone here resents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she looked at him , quite candidly , and said she had no way of knowing that , because teachers in general are not prone to do any direct face-to-face criticism . It must always come back-handed , at parties where you are not present , and after meetings when you have gone home , and in private conferences with students .  | Kennedy could only smile at this . You must n't let yourself get such black notions , ' he said . It 's not good for you . ' Pauline Maury did n't smile . It 's true , ' she said , that academics resent success . If you can write a book which has an appeal to more than fifty or a hundred widely dispersed authorities , it is immediately suspect of the two-fold sin of unsound scholarship and gross commercialism . The private thing , the correct little compilation of something , is the only study that can be considered scholarly . And it 's very easy to see why . It is simply because the imaginations and capabilities of scholars never extend beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , and therefore scholars have rationalized it into being the correct thing to do . ' She raised her hands , and looked at Kennedy , very straight . What do you intend to do ? ' she said . I ? I do n't know . What is there to do ? ' Pauline Maury looked at him with something like disdain . You mean to say that you intend simply to let this Mr. Blanchard make a public accusation of me , and then to let me throw myself bodily into the fight in defense of myself and of my book . Is that it ? ' Kennedy looked mystified . He himself had been put under attack , and he could not quite see why . I should n't think it would ever get to that point , ' he said . You 'll get a letter , just like this one . And the thing to do is answer it . Tell him whatever he  | should be told , and ask him to prove his case , line by line , page by page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he can do it , is there ? ' What do you mean ? ' Pauline Maury said . Her face was white , and her eyes flashed so black that they looked red . What are you saying ? ' Kennedy looked frightened . Is n't that right ? ' he said . All you have to do is answer him and the whole thing will be over . That 's all I meant . ' If you believe , ' Pauline Maury said , that I will be willing to have anything at all to do with this Mr. Blanchard in any way , you are simply very wrong . I would let him print lies about me and about my book and about the university and about all of my family from Guy de Montfort on down , but I will not allow myself to have anything whatever to do with him , not by letter , nor by word , nor by act . He 's a type I despise , and to do him the honor of bickering with him in private or in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how you could suggest it . Oh , ' Kennedy said , and he could n't seem to think of anything else . It is not my battle , ' Pauline Maury said . My work is what it is , and it can stand on its own merits . As I see it , the whole question is a matter of what effect such a dispute or such a lot of scandalmongering might have on the university . ' She paused , and watched Kennedy until she was sure he understood her before she went on .  | As for myself , ' she said , I am perfectly willing , and even a little eager , to abdicate , to resign , and to try to forget what teaching itself has meant to me . It would be a certain pleasure to be free again to write for myself with no reference to the university , to stand completely independent of the petty conventions of the academic life . ' She waited again for Kennedy to speak , and when he did not , or could not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , as I see it , this is not entirely the point . The issue itself is much more important than the person involved . Mr. Blanchard can not hurt me , but he can hurt the reputation of the university . And if you should care enough to want to do something about it , I should think it might be in your power to stop him , to keep him still . And if the issue is important enough to you to warrant your doing something about it , then I should think . .. ' She did n't finish the sentence . She turned her back , and braced her hands against the shelf of the mantelpiece and looked down into the fireplace . Turning her back was like absenting herself to give the judge a chance to deliberate . Janet got up and started toward the study , moving very quietly , as if not to disturb anything . As she got near the door , Pauline Maury turned her head , sidewise , and spoke to her . Please stay , Janet . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were telling her that it was supremely important that a third person be present at this discussion , and Janet , hearing the tone of it ,  | had nothing else to do but come back . She turned around , walked to the chair where her coat was , got the pack of cigarettes out of the pocket , and came back to the center of the room and began to look for a match . There was a stand lighter on a little table beside one of the chairs , and she went to it , picked it up , snapped the lid open two or three times , and when nothing happened , set it down again . Pauline Maury walked toward her quickly , picked up the lighter , and looked closely at it , unbelieving . Does n't it work ? ' she said . She put her thumb on the release , annoyed . But it must work , ' she said . It always has . ' She snapped the lid open twice and the second time , the little blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked serene again and triumphant , and held it out as if it were a torch , a little lamp of knowledge for Janet to light her cigarette by . I do n't think there 's anything I can do about it , ' John Kennedy said , and she wheeled around and came back to the sofa and sat down on the farther end of it , and looked at him . Very well , then , ' she said . Then that 's it . That 's all there is to it . ' She still had the lighter in her hand and she flicked the lid up and down and made sparks . Her face was tight . But is there ? ' Kennedy said . If you wo n't write to him , I do n't see that anything I can say will be of any use . ' I 've tried to explain to you how I feel about it . ' she said , and her voice was so cold that Kennedy began to gulp a little and make sounds of apology .  | I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter will be settled . ' What will that settle ? ' Kennedy said . It will settle the university 's responsibility to me . ' She slapped the lighter from one hand to the other and back again . Is n't that the simplest way ? ' she said . If the university does not have enough faith in me to stand behind me , surely the best thing would be for me to break connections entirely , and relieve all of you of the burden of having anything to do with me . ' John Kennedy looked at her and saw how furiously angry she was , and he tried to talk calmly . You ought to realize , ' he said , that if the university did not believe in you , we never in the world would have created a professorship for you . The last thing any one of us would want would be your resignation . ' He looked at her and smiled , and when he spoke his voice was slightly constrained and even a little ironic , the way people of complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't believe you know how important you are to us . ' On the contrary , ' Pauline Maury said . I 'm getting rather a sharp sense of it . If I were really important , you 'd want to keep me . ' But we do , ' Kennedy said . You do , ' Pauline Maury said slowly . But not enough to be willing to take my part against that of an obvious madman . ' Kennedy looked baffled . He was ready to take a  | suggestion , to take any suggestion , but he had none handy . What could I do ? ' he said . Is there something I could do ? ' Pauline Maury answered him immediately . You can do everything , ' she said . You can write to him , and you can tell him that no scholar in all the United States will believe him , and that no editor of any learned journal will publish anything he wants to write against me . You can tell him you have sufficient proofs , though proofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote my book , not in France but in the United States , and that I could not possibly have been able to refer to an obscure manuscript in the library at Grenoble . Say to him that he is mad , completely insane , and that you think he should be investigated . II No , do n't say that . It 's not the way to deal with madmen . Say to him that you believe his case to be entirely groundless , and that many others , authorities in the field , also believe his case to be groundless , and that your firm and best-considered advice to him is to remain silent to be willing to give up his fantastic claim , rather than to alienate every reputable scholar and every influential educator in America . ' She stopped to catch her breath . The whole thing is so completely preposterous , ' she said . To think that I should fall back on a source like that , the doctoral dissertation of a woman who was never known , never even heard of , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it up . You have only to tell him how ridiculous he will make himself in the eyes of people like yourself . '  | She looked at Kennedy . He was frowning again . Do you see ? ' she said . Speak for yourself , and for education in general , and leave my own rights and feelings wholly out of it . ' I do n't know , ' Kennedy said , how it would work . ' What do you mean ? ' John Kennedy squirmed like a little boy called on to explain himself before the principal . He thought it out , and it could be seen on his face that he did not like what he was going to say . He was very quiet about it . In the first place , ' he said , I do n't think from the tone of this man 's letter that he would let himself be intimidated , and in the second place , well , I do n't believe I could do it . ' Pauline Maury narrowed her eyes . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to intimidate the man ? ' No , ' Kennedy said , of course not . ' And nevertheless you are unwilling to do anything to help me . ' Kennedy straightened up and faced her , and when he spoke , his voice was no longer tentative or hesitant . I 'd do anything I could to help you , ' he said , but there 's no point in being illogical about it ? there 's nothing I can do . I wish there were . ' He spoke with finality . It was a refusal , and Pauline Maury did n't contest it . She looked hurt , and she looked betrayed , but she took it with the air of one who has known betrayal before and who expects nothing better . Kennedy saw the look .  | This man , ' he said , Mr. Blanchard , very obviously believes he has a case against you . He believes , and is ready to prove , that you stole at least half your book , that the work was not your own , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know ? and who could be a better judge ? ? that you wrote the book yourself , that the ideas were yours , the research yours , and the writing yours . And yours the credit for an important book . Well , then , the one thing to do is to answer the man , to give him proof , since he challenges you , that everything he accuses you of is false and wrong . Answer him right down the line . First , you never heard of anyone named Claire Blanchard , who he claims is the author of a manuscript you never saw . And second . . . ' He paused , and then smiled . That 's all , ' he said . There is n't any second . It 's as simple as that . ' He smiled again , and made a little gesture with his hands to show how simple it was . Simplest thing in the world . A man accuses you of plagiarism , you ask him to prove it , and he ca n't do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have literary disputes in the first place , but they do , apparently , and when one of them starts something , the thing to do is call him , forthrightly and out in the open . Pauline Maury stood up and stretched herself tall and looked down at the man who was giving the advice . No , ' she said , it is not so simple as that . It is not in me to be aggressive even against an aggressor . ' She looked across at Janet , and then beyond her ,  | and a little smile twisted her mouth , and she sighed and said : I shall wait . No one cares to defend me and I have no inclination to defend myself , and so I shall simply wait and see what Mr. Blanchard does to me , and to all of us . ' Kennedy stood up . His time for giving advice was over . This was his time to leave , to get out of there , and to stop talking . He looked around for his hat . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to know what you felt about it . ' He stood beside Pauline Maury , looking down at her , and there was no doubt at all , now , that he was tired and confused and annoyed . Pauline Maury 's eyes opened wide . The man was walking toward the door . She saw him start , and then she moved quickly to walk beside him . No , please , no , ' she said . This is not a time to leave . ' He stopped and looked down , and she talked fast . Do you know that we 've been so concerned about this stupid letter that I have n't even thought to offer you any brandy ? Stay for a drink at least . ' She did n't wait for him to answer before she called to Janet . Jan , bring the brandy and some glasses , will you , darling ? ' Janet got up from her chair , and Kennedy , at the door , spoke to her . No , really , ' he said . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and when Janet paused on her way ,  | Pauline Maury 's voice cut in with the original order . Of course he will . Bring it , Janet , quickly . ' Janet went to the kitchen . All the teacups and cocktail glasses of the afternoon had been washed and put away , and the kitchen was bright and cool and quiet . Under the sink there was a dish of salmon , all untried , and beside it a saucer full of milk . The brandy was in the lower cupboard , and Janet took the bottle , held it up against the light , and then set it on the sink and got another bottle , and cut the wax away from the cork and uncorked it and set it on the tray with two brandy glasses . She picked up the tray and backed up against the swinging door and went into the living room , and when she looked up she saw Pauline Maury lying , face-down , on the sofa . Kennedy had gone . She carried the tray to the big table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the sofa . Pauline Maury lay very still , evidently not crying , and she did n't move until Janet turned away and started to walk toward the bedroom . Then she sat up fast . Come here , Janet , will you ? ' Janet turned around and looked at Pauline , and Pauline looked up at her , worried and apologetic . So many things , ' she said . So many too many things at one time . ' She shook her head and sat huddled in the corner of the sofa . Pour us a drink , will you ? ' I do n't want one , ' Janet said . Then one for me . I 'll drink alone , the way I do everything else . '  | Janet went to the table and poured a jolt of brandy into the deep round bottom of the glass , and brought it to her , and as she took it Pauline Maury took her hand too , and held tightly and pulled her down beside her . What 's the matter , Jan ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this happen to us ? ' Janet did n't answer . She sat on the edge of the sofa , ready to get up whenever the hand would release her . But the hand held tighter . I 'm frightened , ' Pauline Maury said . What of ? ' I do n't know . Darling , hold my hand , will you ? I do n't know which way to go . ' She let go of Janet 's hand , and Janet looked at her a minute and saw the look , and the pallor , and the wavering . The look in her eyes was one she 'd seen before . She 'd seen a dog caught in the middle of a boulevard with traffic coming both ways . The hand lay limp on the cushion , small and brown and narrow , with nails like cherries , and she could n't touch it . But she did n't get up . Drink the brandy , ' she said . You 'll be all right . ' Pauline Maury turned the corners of her mouth upward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and drank , and the two of them sat silent . Pauline Maury took two or three sips of brandy before she spoke , and then she said : You remembered Claire Blanchard , did n't you ? ' No , ' Janet said . Yes , ' Pauline Maury said . I saw that you did .  | Why did n't you speak up ? Why did n't you tell Mr. Kennedy who she was ? ' Because I did n't know , ' Janet said . Yes , ' Pauline Maury said . You remembered . But I ca n't think when I told you about her or what I told you . ' Janet told her what she wanted to know . You were showing me some photographs one time , a long time ago , ' she said . Oh , yes , ' Pauline Maury said . And what did I say about her ? ' I do n't think you said anything . There were three or four pictures of her , and you looked at them and said that that was Claire Blanchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Pauline Maury lifted the brandy . And if she were n't dead , ' she said , she would never allow a thing like this to happen to me . ' She set down the glass and put a hand up over her eyes a moment , and when she talked again her voice was frantic . She would n't have let this happen . It never would have happened . Whatever she had was mine . It was the way she wanted it . It did n't matter what it was  --  a bunch of grapes , a flower , a view of the sun rising , a story to laugh at . She shared those things . She only wanted them so that I could have them , so that she could give them to me . She wanted to give me everything she had , and she wanted me to take what she had to give . ' She looked at Janet . Do you understand this ? '  | she said . She gave to me , the way I give to you . Because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever I know . ' Janet made a movement to get up , but the little hand grabbed her wrist , and kept her where she was . I want you to know this , ' Pauline Maury said . You 're the only person in the world I can tell it to , because you 're the only one I know who is free enough to understand it . ' She looked at Janet , and Janet 's face was cold , completely detached . She was not receptive , but Pauline Maury tried anyhow . I If Paul Blanchard is telling the truth , ' she said , if he has a copy of the manuscript and there is another in the University of Grenoble , there is nothing I can do . It will be the thing that has become part of my own book . ' Janet looked at her , and she was not detached now . She was amazed and uncomprehending . It 's true ? ' she said . It was n't your own ? ) ' No , ' Pauline Maury said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the way Janet looked , the bewilderment and the sudden collapse of all faith , she hurried . She hurried to throw words around that bare body of truth , to cloak it with reasons and explanations and circumstances . It was n't my own , ' she said . And this house I live in is n't my own , and the dinners that come to my table are n't my own , and the clothes I wear are n't my own . And you , the one person I have in the world , were never my own .  | Do n't you see , ' she said , that no one owns anything ? But I have a right to live in my house , and I have a right to eat my dinners , and wear my clothes . Someone else made them , but I have honestly come by the privilege of possessing them and of using them in any way I find good . ' She waited for Janet to speak or to look up or to move , but Janet stayed speechless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa ; she had gone limp , and she sprawled backward with her face against a cushion . She was with me , ' Pauline Maury said , when she wrote it . It was two years , and we were together in it . At night we read it together and talked about it , and revised it , and made it right . And in the daytime she wrote , she worked , and I went out and tutored backward students and modeled clothes , and did everything else I could do , so that we could live and so that she could be free to write it in her own way and on her own time . Do you see ? And when she went away , when she left me and went back to her husband , I kept a copy and I kept her notes . First she was gone , and then she was dead , and the only things I had were those photographs and some letters and her book . Not her book , really , but our book . When I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look at it for three years . ' Her voice had been quiet and calm and persuasive , and suddenly she broke off and whirled toward Janet with quick words : What am I going to do ? '  | Janet did n't look at her . I do n't know , ' she said . There must be a way . There must be a way , but I do n't know what it is . ' She turned to Janet again . Jan , tell me , will you , please ? You 're not angry , are you ? You ca n't be angry . You ca n't , because you 're all on earth I 've got left . You 're all that matters to me . You 're the only one who knows me , the only one I can tell the truth to . ' She did n't look at Janet when she said this . She said it off in the other direction , slowly , and when her voice broke , finally , she tipped up the brandy glass and drained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and came back and stood in front of the sofa and looked down at Janet . We can go away , ' she said , and when she saw Janet draw back , she talked fast to make it sound better and to say how it would be to go away from a place like this . Just to forget everything , to forget the promotion , forget the place and the people , the whole stodgy lot of them . Simply clear out , wash one 's hands , make a clean break with teaching and with all it stands for , all the pompousness , and respectability , and falseness of it . We 're not made for it , ' she said , neither one of us . We 're made for a different kind of world , where people say what they mean and live as they please and write as they please and never once wonder what John Kennedy would think of it , or Mrs. Girard , or Dean Sperry , or the students , or the parents of the students , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped , and rolled the brandy over her tongue . You feel it , too , do n't you ? You do n't adapt to it , the life on two levels . It ca n't be any better for you than it is for me . ' She had been saying all of this smoothly , not insisting on any of it , but only getting it said . And now , having said it , she sat down quickly by Janet 's side , and said : That 's what 's wrong , is n't it ? That 's why you went away tonight , and that 's why you tried to hurt me last night . I know it now , and I do n't know why I did n't know it all along . You were right . It 's impossible to live this way . I knew you were worried , I 've been seeing it coming ; all the anxiety and the insecurity were beginning to show in you . But I never knew until tonight how ragged I am myself . ' She shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said . I 'm tired and I 'm ill . It 's the same for both of us . ' Yes , ' Janet said . But we 'll pick up . We 're only tired now , and I 'm very much upset by Paul Blanchard 's stirring up a fuss . ' She looked into her glass as if it were the letter she was reading , and when she looked up again she had the same lost look . What am I going to do ? Whatever am I going to do ? ' she said , and a moment later she shook herself free of it , and made herself go back to something she could take hold of , some action she could perform , the  | act of flight . There was only one thing , and that was distance ? that was to put a great distance between themselves and their persecutors . It would n't matter so much about the book , and about what Paul Blanchard might choose to do with his evidence , if only they could be away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invulnerable . Away somewhere permanently and together , never to have to see the small smiles of satisfaction on the little pinched-up professorial faces , and never to have to hear the sharp tsk-tsking tongues of people like Mrs. Girard , that ostentatious and illiterate little donor and sponsor . She laughed a little and turned to Janet . Tell me , darling , will our heads ever shake like that ? Will we always have sense enough to know at what moment to stop making the attempt to drink from a teacup ? ' She smiled again , and drank very steadily and precisely from the brandy snifter . Oh , it will be good to be away from here V Janet turned on the sofa , and Pauline Maury looked away from her and went on talking , quietly and always testing the feeling of what she said . She was adlibbing , making plans on a system of free association by which she was willing to give voice to almost anything in the hope of discovering something that sounded good . But always it remained essentially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem was to say where to go . To the north ? To Canada , where they could wear rough plaid shirts and cut  | their own wood and load the fireplace with it . It would be good in Canada . They could learn to hunt and to fish and to ski , and in the summer they could take canoe trips and write letters on sheets of birch bark like James Fenimore Cooper . Tell me , ' she said to Janet , did you ever have a James Fenimore Cooper period ? ' No , ' Janet said . Oh , I did , ' Pauline said . He was tremendously read in France . ' She narrowed her eyes . Such wonderful things , ' she said . Indians , and pathfinders and wigwams . But I do n't think Cooper ever came up to Chateaubriand as a wood-lore man . Atala was my favorite book for years . Chateaubriand 's Indians were always so much more French than Cooper 's . ' She laughed again , and this time there was some spirit in the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Canada would n't be the place ; she 'd make such a Parisian Indian that her toes would be frozen off in no time . No , it would have to be another kind of place , a place in the sun where living is warm . Some sort of place where they could lie on a beach , just that , and swim in the breakers , and come out shining and dripping and lie on the beach again . And eat and drink in little shore restaurants , and walk and read and write and always know the sound of the sea in their room at night . This was it , and so possible to find , and really such a pleasant quest , this hunt for the place , the one right place for them . It would n't matter too much . They could be slow about it , and go from one  | place to another until they found one that would fit in their hands . They 'd start looking somewhere in the Florida keys , three thousand miles away from here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they wanted to stop . She 'd got back everything she 'd lost , and she looked as if she could stand up to any of them again . The fear had gone from her eyes , and the lost look . She knew where she was going , she was back on the track , and it made a great deal of difference in the way she looked and in the way her voice sounded . Do you know , ' she said , I 'm beginning to be glad all this happened . If it had n't , we might have stayed here the rest of our lives , making lectures , having the mob to tea , correcting blue-books , getting up too early , and all the rest of it . We might never have got the chance to know what we 're really like . ' I should n't have gone to pieces , ' she said a moment later , when Janet still did n't answer . I should n't have worried about the book , or felt so trapped . Because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the careful people , the humdrum , methodical , obedient ones , who have easy lives , darling , do you know ? It 's only the ones who are willing to give up everything else in constant , dribbling concessions to safety . There never was a great person , a great poet or musician or artist of any kind , who was safe or who even understood what it is to be careful . The ones I feel I know were never out of trouble . Think of the messes Baudelaire and Rimbaud and Verlaine and Gauguin were in from the beginnings of their lives  | straight to the end . Think of the divine disorder of those lives , and think of the insults they took as their natural stipend from people less talented and more respectable . ' Janet stayed silent through all of it , and now when there came a break in the flow of plans , she made the push , sat up , and said what she had to say . I 'm going to leave here tonight . ' She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , and Pauline Maury was up in a flash and beside her , spinning her around . We ca n't , ' she said . Not tonight . We ca n't leave for a week . Not until I find out what Mr. Kennedy intends . ' I can , ' Janet said , and the meaning was clear enough , but Pauline Maury would n't take it to mean anything . No , ' she said . We 've had enough for one day , both of us . What I need is to turn on the sun lamp and burn it all out of me . Shall we ? ' She looked closely at Janet and it was the strongest appeal she 'd made . It was all supplication , the look , and it was humble and gentle . There was no axe to grind . It was a direct , person-to-person entreaty to forget , to let the evils of the day be enough for one day , and to rest together now , stretched under the warm glow of the sun lamp with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stopped and waited and when it was time she was able to say again what she meant . I ca n't stay here any longer . I 'm going . '  | She turned and went into the study and Pauline Maury followed her and heard her saying it again . I 'll never stay another night in this house . I should n't have come here in the first place . ' She started toward the desk , and picked up a book and looked at it , and then wheeled around and faced the woman . And I do n't care what Baudelaire did , or what Rimbaud did . All I know is that I ca n't stand this . I 'm sorry , but I ca n't . ' She went to the closet and opened the door . There were two suitcases stacked together on the top shelf and she jumped up , like a basketball player , and hit at them until she got them off balance and they both slid off the shelf and fell . She caught one of them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she picked it up and put both of them , empty and open , on the couch , and ran her hands through her hair , thinking what to do next . You 're not going to do this , ' Pauline Maury said , and the girl only looked at her , and went to the closet and started hauling out clothes . You 're not , ' Pauline said . You ca n't . Where would you go ? ' I 'm going home , ' Janet said . Pauline Maury laughed . No , ' she said . You 're not going home ; you 're going back to the place where I found you tonight , back to the cellar stairs . ' Janet was folding and wadding clothes and putting them in the suitcase , and Pauline Maury came up to her and grabbed a dress out of her hand and made her look at her .  | Is that what you think you 're doing ? Tell me . ' The blood came up fast into Janet 's face , and she stepped back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress again . No , ' she said . All I want to do now is go home . Will you let me have that dress ? ' Why should I let you have anything ? ' Pauline Maury said . All you 've done to me is to cheat and to lie . To stand there now and lie to me again . To say you 're going home . You have n't any home . Your only home is with scullery boys and Filipinos and bums and whatever you can get . You 're a filthy nymphomaniac and nothing I 've been able to do for you has ever changed you from that , has it ? No , you 've never changed . It was no good my bringing you here and trying to raise you out of it ; you were sunk so deeply in it in the beginning , I might as well have never tried . It never left a mark on you . ' Janet had backed away while it came at her , and now she stopped and shook her head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she said . It left a mark on me . It certainly left a mark on me . ' And she turned away and went into the bedroom and jerked open a drawer of the chiffonier and took a pile of things out of it ? stockings and shorts and pajamas ? and came back with them and put them in the smaller one of the suitcases . There was something in the tone of what she had said that kept sounding through the room and quieted Pauline Maury . She did n't follow Janet into the bed-  | room , and when Janet came back into the study with the stack of clothes , she put the question to her . What do you mean by that ? ' By what ? ' You said I 'd made a mark on you . How did you mean that ? ' Janet suddenly stopped packing and sank down on the couch and told her . I mean that I 'll never be able , now , to do anything . Not anything . ' She stopped talking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to do ? And what on earth are you fit to do ? ' Janet looked up . Nothing , ' she said , and when Pauline smiled at her she broke out . I guess the only thing I 'm fit for now is to stay with you , just the way you want it , and let you have everything the way you think it ought to be . And when I go nuts you can put me back into the sanitarium , and fix it all up , and bring me here and start it over again . ' Pauline Maury clenched her hands a couple of times before she could speak , and when the release came it came with a rush . That 's how it seems to you , does it ? That 's what it means to you to live here and take everything I have to give you ? ' Yes , ' Janet said , that 's what it means to me . I do n't want to take anything of yours . And I 've tried to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's been like this . It 's been a shut-out every time . You 've tried to scare me into staying , or you 've made me feel sorry for you . ' Pauline Maury started to speak , but Janet broke through and kept it going . And you 've tried to make me believe we were something we were n't , and that we lived on a higher plane and saw everything clearer and freer than anybody else . We were artists , and I believed that for a while . You had me thinking that if I stayed drunk long enough and kept myself far enough off center and knew what it was to have a whip bite into me until my nerves were all on the outside , that then I could arrive at something , a kind of sublime state of something . And you were writing a book , tearing it out of your heart , in a locked room . ' She looked straight at Pauline Maury , saying this , and then went on . I believed in the book , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been through it now . I 've learned everything you wanted me to learn . I 'm a specialist in a very narrow branch of literature , and along with it I know what it 's like to be drunk for two weeks , and to sleep for three days in a big red fog , and to walk down the street and see a tree come at me fast and try to fall on me . And I know what it 's like to lose hold of everything and lie wrapped up in a wet sheet until they 're ready to unwrap me and let me out . I 've done the whole thing now . I know what higher morality 's like , and no decent person would be caught dead with me. '  | She stooped down and unhooked the clasps of her sandals and took them off and put them in the suitcase , and then she went to the closet and put on a pair of moccasins and brought three other pairs of shoes and put them in the suitcase . She was working fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , as many of them as she could , and closing a lid on them . She worked , and she did not look up . She left the study three or four times and came back with toothbrushes and powder and slippers and a bathrobe , separately , and Pauline Maury stood in the middle of the room holding the dress in both hands and watching her . Janet was going . That was clear enough . She was packing her bags and she was getting out . When things were too much for her to deal with ? a tennis racquet clamped in a wooden frame , and an umbrella , and a couple of Mexican travel posters rolled in a long roll ? she chucked them back into the closet and let them go . When she had packed everything there was room for , she went to the desk and took a look . Her papers were in the big top drawer , a stack of them all neatly typed and bound , term-papers and honor essays she 'd written and saved from three years back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed them in her hands and looked at them a minute , and then dropped them , endwise , into the wastebasket . She looked at the books , too , spread all over the top of the desk , and she made a pile of them and then turned away and left them . It was only a question now of changing her clothes , and she stripped  | off the black dress , and dropped it inside out into the larger suitcase , and put on a sweater and skirt she 'd left in the closet , and a jacket and a raincoat she 'd dumped on the couch . She looked around , trying to pull everything together in her mind , and then she said , Purse , ' out loud and went into the bedroom and came back with two purses , a black one and a tan one , and dropped the black one into the suitcase , and set the tan one on the desk to wait . It had been a matter of ten minutes , all told , and neither one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching it happen , watching the clothes go into the bags and the papers into the scrap pile , and she did n't move to stop it or to say anything until she saw Janet put her knee on the top of a suitcase and shove it down and snap the lock . And this is the way you leave ? ' she said . You take your things and go away at ' ? she looked at the clock on the desk ? at a quarter after twelve . And you say you have no plans . You are going to go home , to take the train and go home to your father and your young brothers . Is that it ? ' There was no rancor in her voice . She seemed to be asking a question . Yes , ' Janet said . And what am I to do ? Am I to say that you are ill , or that you were called home , or that you have decided , so suddenly , to abandon your assistantship and to give up all the work you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Janet said . ' Which do I say ? ' It does n't matter . ' It does n't matter to you , but it will matter to others . You see , no one simply packs off and leaves an obligation without first making some explanation , or making some arrangement for the work to go to someone else . Mr. Kennedy saw you here tonight . He 'll know you 're not ill , and he 'll probably think your leaving has something to do with the Blanchard letter . ' Janet had her knee on the smaller suitcase . She pushed , and the snap would n't close , and so she pulled the lid up again and pulled the clothes away from the hinges , and put the lid down and tried again and got her knee on the back , and this time she forced it down . She set both suitcases on the floor , side by side . That letter is none of my business at all . It 's your business , and you ca n't get me in on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only a question to ask : Will you tell me at least what you intend to do now ? ' I 've told you , ' Janet said . I 'm going home and I 'm going to stay home . ' But tonight ? Will there be trains to New Mexico at midnight ? ' I do n't know , ' Janet said . There might be . ' Pauline Maury was standing holding Janet 's dress , a green-and-blue plaid dress , wadded up close to her as if it were a doll or a baby , and when she heard  | Janet speak , she jerked it , very suddenly , between her hands and flung it down . That 's it , ' she said . You 'd try it again . You 'd lie to me even now . You 'd come back here and pack your bags and tell me you 're going home , when you have no slight intention of going home . All you want to do is to get out of this house tonight under any pretext at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I 'll let you go . The things that have happened to me tonight do n't mean anything to you , do they ? It does n't matter to you that people are trying to hurt me and to ruin me . All you want is to go . But you 're not going home . You 'll go back to your boy . Do n't think I do n't know that . As soon as you leave here you 'll go back to him , or back to whatever it is he does to you. , Janet looked down at the dress lying on the floor and spoke slowly . No , I ca n't go back there . ' There was something convincing in the tone , and Pauline Maury looked up , asking , and Janet answered . You do n't think he 'd have me , now , do you ? ' Pauline Maury took this in slowly , trying to decide what it meant , and when she could n't be sure , she asked straight out . It was very important to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only telling you that he wo n't have me . He knows about me . ' What does he know about you ? ' Janet looked at her , puzzled , and while she was wondering , Pauline Maury asked her again .  | What does he know about you , will you please tell me ? ' He knows what I 've been , that 's all , ' Janet said . He knows everything about it . I 've tried to tell him a hundred times and tonight I made it . ' Pauline Maury began to walk . She walked back and forth across the room , clenching and unclenching her hands . When she stopped , she stopped close in front of Janet , and burst out at her . What did you think you were doing ? Do n't you have any sense of what you can say around a place like this and what you can not say ? Do n't you know anything ? ' No , ' Janet said . I do n't know anything . ' You know enough to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did it , too , did n't you ? You had the chance and you made the most of it . ' She started to walk again and then she spun around . What did you tell him ? Tell me what you told him . ' Janet looked down at the two bags , standing together on the floor , ready to go . I told him what I had to tell him . And it was enough to make him hate me . You do n't need to worry about my going back there . He would n't touch me with a pole now . He hates me , do you understand that ? ' Yes , I understand , ' Pauline Maury said . He hates you and you 're going home , are n't you ? That 's the way you do it . You go away , and you leave me here to face him , and everyone he 'll tell , and all the unjust and rotten accusations he 'll bring against me. '  | No , ' Janet said . That 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wo n't tell anybody about you . ' How do you know that ? ' I know that , because I know him . He would n't bother with it . ' Pauline Maury drew a breath . Did he say that ? ' she said . No , ' Janet said . He did n't say anything . But it 's not you that hurt him . You could have been anybody . I 'm the one . He wanted to marry me . ' And because he wanted to marry you you were willing to expose me , you were happy to do anything you could to bring a scandal against my name . What do you think is going to become of me ? ' Janet listened to it , and her eyes widened a little . Look , ' she said . Do n't be frightened , do n't worry about it . He would n't do anything to you . I know that . I did n't want to do anything that would be bad for you . I just want to leave , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I have to get out of this town , because I do n't want to be here another day . But he wo n't hurt you . Nobody 's going to bother you . ' She picked up the tan purse and stuck it under her arm , and then she started to pick up the two suitcases . It was half-past twelve . The curtains were drawn in all the rooms of the apartment , and in all the rooms there was light , but the place was changed from the slick thing it had always been . The wastebaskets were too full , and there were bare clothes hangers sticking around everywhere . Only the living room was as usual , strictly ordered , with the surfaces bare and all  | things in their places . The golden curtains were spread for the night in a curve across the glass wall , and opposite them there was the big painting , practically a mural , of abstract forms in shocking colors . The silver tray was white against the black table , the Marnier bottle and the brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the only imperfection in the room was not anything that could be seen . It was a staleness in the air from the smoke of the cocktail party , and it clung thick in the curtains and the carpet and the chairs . Janet came out of the study first ; carrying the two suitcases and holding herself straight against the weight of them . Her head was bare and her raincoat drooped backward away from her neck and off her shoulders . She came into the room slowly and set the suitcases down , and opened her purse and got a pair of gloves out of it . She was putting them on when she heard the cat , and when she looked in the direction of the sound , she saw him lying on her black coat on the chair beside the door . This was another thing to do . She crossed the room and picked up the cat and put him on the floor and held the coat for a moment , undecided , but she did n't open either one of the suitcases again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her keys jingle she took them out of a pocket and put them on the mantel . Pauline Maury stood just outside the study door , watching her . She stood very still , perfectly straight , with her head up and her eyes level . She was still smooth . Her hair lay in flat black waves close to her  | head , and the rubies shot red beams from the tips of her ears . She could stand like this , composed and alert , and watch Janet Logan make up her mind what to do with two suitcases and a purse and a coat . She did n't speak to Janet , she only stood beside the study door and watched her buttoning her raincoat and cinching up the belt . When the cat saw her , he came to her and rubbed his sides against the long black skirt until she stooped down and picked him up and held him against her shoulder . She stroked his back in long rough sweeps that shot yellow hairs out into the air , and the cat worked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vibrated all through the room . Janet put the black coat under one arm and the purse under the other and picked up the suitcases , and Pauline Maury stroked the cat harder and harder and let her nails bite into his back until he spat at her and tried to bat her ear with his paw . Janet turned and looked at her , and she dropped the cat to the floor and smiled a little and touched her hand to her ear to see if there was any blood . She was starting to speak when the doorbell rang . It rang loudly , first a long buzz and then a wait and then three or four quick rings , as if whoever it was was impatient to get in . Pauline Maury turned quickly toward the door , and all the composure dropped away from her . She took a step and then stopped and looked around the room wildly , like an animal cornered and stuck . She faced Janet and spoke fast , almost in a whisper .  | Who is it ? ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she started toward the door to push the release , Pauline Maury was behind her , stopping her . No . Are you crazy ? ' Janet turned and looked at her , and the bell buzzed again , a long one . I wo n't let him in , ' Pauline Maury said . He 's come to kill me . ' Who ? ' That one . That Blanchard . He 'll kill me . ' She was talking fast , telling everything she knew and everything she feared . How had she been able to know he would ever see the book ? The one person who should never have seen it . The one person who should have stayed in France and remarried and never have read books in English . I wo n't let him in , ' she said , and she turned to Janet , white and scared . Do n't let him hurt me . ' It 's stopped ringing , ' Janet said . Nobody 's corning . It must have been a mistake . ' Do you think so ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should I have trouble with a man , ' she said , when I 've never had anything to do with men ? Why does it have to be ? ' Janet did n't answer that . She just looked at her , and when she saw her pacing again , and clenching her hands , and looking shaky , she tried to do something for her .  | If he had any idea about coming here , ' Janet said , he would n't have asked for an explanation in a letter . He 'd have come right away if he 'd been going to come . ' Pauline Maury stopped pacing . Yes , ' she said , that 's true . He 'll do it the other way . He 'll do it as publicly as he can . There are all kinds of ways of killing , and that 's the one he 'll choose . ' She was talking and she did n't hear the elevator stop in the hall . But Janet heard it . What 's the matter ? ' The elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell and got in , then , ' Pauline Maury said , and while she was saying it there was a rap at the door . Pauline Maury wavered . She started first toward the bedroom , and then toward the kitchen , and then the rap sounded again , two short knocks , and she went to the table and propped herself back against it and motioned with her head for Janet to open the door , and Janet crossed the room and turned the knob , and Ray MacKenzie stood there and looked at her a minute and then came into the room . He walked past Janet without speaking to her and went directly to Pauline Maury and stood looking down at her . His eyes were bright and his hair was hanging over his forehead dripping with fog . He did n't speak , he just stood there and looked at her as if he had to find out what she looked like and every-  | thing about her . This was the woman . This was the one , and he looked at her to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red-mouthed , brightstriped . What was she , what was she for ? What would it be like to know this woman , to put a hand out and touch her , and hear her talking to you , to have her give you the key to the medicine chest and tell you to be asleep when she got home ? What would it be like to see her at night , and then in the morning , and meet her somewhere and have lunch with her ? What would she say when she gave you a brown orchid , or would she write it ? He looked at her , all lost , trying to find out something about it , and Pauline Maury , pinned there against the table , saw what the look was , not fury , not righteousness , but simple bewilderment and wonder ? and she gathered her forces and managed to stiffen herself defensively against it . What do you want ? ' she said , and she said it as simply as she would have said it to a peddler at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange house at this time of night ? What could he have to sell , and why should it be so important ? What do you want ? ' When it was put so directly , the question mixed Ray up . He looked down at the woman who was asking it , and she stood there so cool , with such a right to ask questions , that he could n't answer her . He could n't say what it was he wanted . He had run all the way here to this house at this time of night and forced his way in , and now that he was here , what for ? Some-  | body says what do you want , and that 's a real question . What do you want ? What is there to say or do ? It 's no good to kill anyone , or to smash up a house , or throw your weight around . Whatever happened , it 's all over now , it 's been done , and nothing will undo it . It was all in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder ? how could this happen to him , so cocksure three hours ago , so full of good ideas about himself and his girl , and where they 'd go and what they 'd be together . And now he knew better , and he was here to do something about it . He came here to smash this , to smash it , and grind it under his foot , but when it looked up at him and asked him what he wanted , he did n't know . With Pauline Maury it was different . She could look at this boy , and see the strain on his face , and the blur in his eyes . She could see all the strength in him , and she could see that he would do nothing with it , and she was no longer afraid of him . She could do as she pleased with him ? talk to him , turn him out , give him something , some advice or something to drink . He was a good-looking boy , and there was something modest and decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted on it . I do n't believe you should have come here , ' she said to him , and she made it all clear that it was a foolish and youthful and unconsidered thing for him to have done . But she also made it clear that she would overlook it . No , ' Ray said . But I wanted to talk to you . ' He spoke out with force , and when he saw her  | shrink back from it , he turned and looked at Janet and then turned away again and began to talk . She does n't want to stay here , ' he said , and I want you to let her go . ' Pauline Maury raised her shoulders , and looked bland . If anyone wanted to leave her or her house , the door was most certainly not barred . She looked across at the two suitcases standing on the floor in proof of it . I 'm going , ' Janet said . I 'm going tonight . ' Ray turned and saw her , and saw for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the suitcases were there and that what she said was true . Where ? ' he said . I 'm going home , ' Janet said . Is that all right ? ' He looked back at Pauline Maury , as if to find out from her , and she nodded her head , saying it was so . When ? ' he said to Janet . As soon as I can go . Tonight . ' When are you coming back ? ' I 'm not coming back . ' He went toward her , as if there were something he could say to her , now , after the other things he 'd said . But he had only to look at her to know there was no good saying anything . She was leaving and he could n't keep her , it was sure . She was getting out , away from Pauline Maury and away from him too . And while she was at it she was leaving all the business behind her , all the years of sitting in classrooms and taking notes and doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , enough to  | last her , and she could take it home now and think it over . He saw that she meant it , and that there was n't any point , now , in trying to stop her . But he tried anyhow . He tried awkwardly and he tried to say right there , with Pauline Maury standing behind him , that they could find some way to fix it . Tonight was like this , but that did n't mean that all the rest of their nights would be like this . People get used to things , even the worst things . Something hits them , something bad like the thing she told him tonight , and they go blind and strike out and raise hell , but after a while when they can think again , they think it over and calm down and see how it is , and go on living . Janet heard him . He was trying hard to say things right , and making a mess of it . I did n't think for a minute we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she said it , Ray tightened up his mouth , and said : God damn it , I did n't mean to say it that way . I meant we 'll probably even be glad it happened , because we 'll end by knowing each other , and not very many people do . Can you understand that ? ' She did n't answer , and he started to speak again , but he could n't . He felt the woman behind him , looking at him and listening for what he would have to say , and his voice stuck , and he turned around to tell her to go away , to give him a chance . But when he turned around , she was not behind him . She was not leaning against the table as she had been . She was n't in the room . He turned back to Janet .  | Where 'd she go ? ' Janet motioned toward the bedroom . Did you see her go ? ' Yes . ' Ray looked toward the bedroom . The door was closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth between something and something else , and drawers being pulled open . And then the door opened and Pauline Maury came back into the room with a bundle of papers ? loose yellow sheets and three or four paper-back notebooks ? in her arms . Her face was strained and she looked tired . She spoke quickly to Janet . Did you hear the elevator ? ' No , ' Janet said . Are you sure ? ' she said , but she did n't look for an answer or listen . She took the bundle of papers and put them in the fireplace . I 'd like to have a fire , ' she said . She got the lighter from the table and lighted the pile at ten places , and then went down on her knees beside it , watching it , holding the leaves apart with a poker to let the air get at them , and blowing . When the flames were high and hot , she got up and stood back . It was a good fire and there was no chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and stepped away from the heat of it . She saw the sheets curl and her mouth curled too . There it was , the thing she thought she admired . She had never seen those yellow sheets
