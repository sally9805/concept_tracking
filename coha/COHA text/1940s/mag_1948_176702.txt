At one time or another , Mississippi-born Stark Young has labored in virtually all the artistic vineyards that might attract a courtly , sensitive Southern gentleman : he has taught at two universities , painted , translated ( Chekhov , Moliere , Machiavelli ) , directed for the stage , written poetry , plays and novels ( including 1934 's best-selling So Red the Rose ) . <P> But Young 's specialty has been the drama criticism which he wrote , in the New Republic , for a quarter of a century . Last year he quit the magazine , which had completely changed its style under the corn-fed editorship of Henry Wallace . Now he has published Immortal Shadows ( Scribner ; $3 ) , a collection of critical pieces spanning his years of professional playgoing . " This volume , " he notes , " represents the last writing that I shall do on the subject of the theater . " <P> Among the best of Critic Young 's immortal shadows preserved in the book : John Barrymore 's Hamlet , Duse , the visits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lan-fang , Gertrude Stein 's Four Saints in Three Acts . <P> Critic Young 's theater reviews are probably the last writing of their kind . No periodical is currently printing anything about the theater that even resembles them . His essays , often more critical of the acting than of the play , walk through the field of esthetics , far from Broadway . He berates the doorway of a certain stage set as " lean and trivial , " and objects to the cut of Juliet 's gown . He sees the theater as a complex collection of arts , each to be weighed . His judgments reflect poetic perception , solid scholarship and standards far loftier than Times Square is accustomed to . If his writing lacks the sparkle , and sometimes the clarity , of some of his colleagues , it has a depth and substance as rare in the theater 's critics as in the theater itself .
