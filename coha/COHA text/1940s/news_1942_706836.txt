" he should have said Britain " ? always won one battle , and that was the last . " It would seem , " said Mr. Churchill , " to have begun rather earlier this time . " The Prime Minister declared that the Germans had been damaged and outfought " with every kind of weapon with which they had beaten down so many small peoples  --  and larger unprepared peoples as well . " " They have been beaten , " he asserted , " by many of the technical apparatus on which they counted to gain dominton of the world . Especially is this true in the air , . as well as of tanks and of artillery which has come into its own . " Designed as Prelude Mr , Churchill said he could not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but declared : " This Battle of Egypt , in itself so important , was designed and timed as a prelude and counterpart to the momentous enterprise undertaken by the United States at the western end of the Mediterranean ? an enterprise under United States command and in which our Armies , Air Force and above all our Navy , are bearing a noble and important share .

" " While there are men , ike General de Gaulle and all those who follow him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Giraud , that gallant warrior whom no prison can hold , while there are men like that to stand forward in the name and in the cause of France my confidence in the future of France is sure , " Mr. Churchill said . Mr. Churchill said the two African undertakings of the United States and Britain were " part of a single strategic and political conception which we labored long to bring to fruition and about which we now are justified in enjoying good and reasonable confidence .

It is not even the beginning of the end . " But it is perhaps the end of the beginning . " " We have not entered this war for profit or expansion but only for honor and to do our duty in tiefending the right , .

For our record we have nothing to fear . We have no need to make excuses or apologies . Our record pleads for us and we shall get gratitude in the breasts of every man and woman in every part of the world . " As I have said , in this war we have no territorial aims . We desire no commercial favors , we wish to alter no sovereignty or frontier for our own benefit .
