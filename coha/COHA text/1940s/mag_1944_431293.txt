N OT long ago , a mammoth new experimental bomber was trundled out of its concrete-floored hangar onto the macadam apron in front of the . building ? and promptly sank into the surface up to its hubs ! The weight carried by its giant wheels was too much for paving designed to support the heaviest aircraft previously built . After the plane was fished out , those wheels not only carried it safely to a take-off , but even were fully retracted in flight ! A Flying Fortress smashes down upon a runway in an emergency landing , not with its normal dead weight of 30 tons , but with 60 , 80 , or even 90 tons of impact weight . The landing gear takes it , and can take it again and again if need be . Fighter pilots get the word of enemy aircraft approaching and rush to their planes waiting with the engines roaring . They hurtle down the runway and take the air . The landing gear retracts into the fuselage and wings and becomes invisible ? in 20 seconds ! Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in landing position in 15 seconds . Moreover , the pilot knows at a glance at his instrument board exactly what posi- tion his landing gear is in at all times . These are examples of the accomplishments of the engineers and designers of landing gear for our modern aircraft ; accomplishments in the face of the most rigid space and weight limitations , for once the plane is airborne , landing gear becomes a liability rather than an asset . There has always seemed to be a goodnatured battle between the aircraft and landing-gear designers -- to see which could gyp the other out of more space , but somehow or other they always get together in the end . Neither can succeed without the help of the other . The problem confronting the gear designers varies with the ship itself , its mission , its speed , and pilot who will fly it . Training ships require sturdy gear and wide tracks ( space between the wheels ) for the ragged landings of students . Bombers need plenty of track , too , coupled with extreme Weightsustaining qualities and equipment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gear that can be retracted and locked in 20 seconds and lowered and locked in 15 seconds , brakes for short stops on small fields , and rugged tires that can stand high-speed landings on - rough fields . As the weight and speed of modern aircraft increase , the designers of landing gear must provide safe , reliable , and compact landing gear to keep pace with them . Tire engineers must , in turn , keep up with the gear designs and provide tires to withstand the tremendous loads , impacts , and burns encountered in hundreds of landings on the worst possible runways . Tires can be made only so big , for there is limited room within the ships to accommodate them . To see just what this means in really big ships , consider the B-19 , the Army 's huge experimental bomber , with a span of 212 feet and a weight of 60 tons loaded . The single tires of this giant are eight feet in diameter and weigh over a ton apiece , with the wheel . Yet failure to retract them entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monster plane , which is 7,750 miles . Speed , too , must be considered in these giants , but in fighter planes the factor of speed is of even greater importance than strength in the design of retracting gear . The Army Air Forces do not install retracting gear on aircraft having speeds less than 175 m.p.h. , except in special types of trainers designed to acquaint students with its use . Above the 175-m.p.h. class it is almost mandatory , for its advantages far offset the added weight . ( Equipping a plane with retracting gear calls for about 15 pounds of reinforcement for every pound of the gear and its retracting equipment . ) With the present aircraft engines , speeds of over 300 m.p.h. would be next to impossible with fixed landing gear . Naturally , these higher speeds mean that the landing speeds will be proportionately greater , and the gear must be designed to take the impact safely time and again on any surface . The fact that the surface of the landing area is not always of the best , and often far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea ? the tricycle landing gear . Such combat aircraft as the Bell P-39 and the Lockheed P-38 , as well as the giant Consolidated B-24 and the Douglas C-54 , use the tricycle gear . So do th , e medium bombers in the North American B-25 and Martin B-26 class . The admitted safety of the tricycle gear , ease of ground handling , and better visibility indicate that this type of gear will soon be standard on private and commercial as well as military aircraft . One of the greatest advantages of this gear is the ability of the craft to operate from much smaller fields . The pilot may safely apply his brakes almost as soon as he " touches down , " and in the take-off he need not use up valuable runway in getting his tail up into flying position , for it already is elevated before the take-off run is started . The inclusion of tricycle gear of either retracting or fixed type will undoubtedly be mandatory in future private planes , because  | of its obvious safety advantages . At present , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we trace the history of landing gear from the time when Lilienthal used his running feet for glider take-off , we find many novel ideas in gear design . The first mechanical landing gear is claimed for the " Eole , " built and said to have been flown in 1890 by Clement F. Ader , of France . This weird aircraft landed , though tragically , on three ski-like skids on the bottom of the fuselage , similar to those later used on the Wright airplane.  | Strangely enough , wheels ? now accepted as standard landing gear for all but seaplanes ? were employed on an experimental aircraft long before the skid-equipped Wright plane actually flew . In 1893 , Horatio Phillips , an Englishman . built a tethered aircraft that rested on ; , tricycle. gear . This machine ran around a circular track and at 40 miles an hour took off and circled the track several times . Wheels , of course , rapidly became standard equipment and appeared in various sizes and types . At first they were rigidly attached to the struts , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and struts , indicating that some sort of shock-absorbing device . was needed . One of the first aircraft to dmploy steel springs was the French Voisin , made famous by Henri Farman . France , where wheel-equipped landing gear originated , produced many startling types of gear .. One featured tandem wheels on the fuselage and a wheel attached to each wing tip . Enclosed wheels , common during World War I , appeared in 1908 . Records show that a small triplane , built by the Danish flyer Ellenhammer and powered with one of the first tractor propellers , featured a tail wheel closed in with fabric . This evidently was intended to serve as added fin area for stability ? which most pioneer aircraft sadly lacked . World War I saw general acceptance of the enclosed wheel , elastic shock cords , and also the strut-and-spreader-bar design . The closed-in wheels increased the speed slightly , the elastic cord was adequate for shock absorbing , and the spreader bar added strength . As speed became more important , the drag of rigid landing struts presented a difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Fokker D-7 and subsequent models by designing the spreader bar as a high-lift airfoil section between the wheels . Various types of streamlined housing for the gear were designed as early as 1912 . The Antoinette monoplane that featured " trousers " also boasted another innovation in a tapered cantilever wing . Early landinggear " pants , " while they increased the speed of the planes , had  | Their drawbacks . They usually weighed so much that the horsepower required to lift them was often more than that originally required to overcome the drag of the gear without them . Modern design , with the help of light metals , has produced some really satisfactory " pants " for certain types of aircraft in which retracting gear is impractical . In 1917 , the name of Capt . James V. Martin first became prominent in connection with landing gear , when he developed a unique semiretracting gear for his little KIII Scout biplane , built at Elyria , Ohio . This rigid-strut gear had wheels with flat springs for spokes , which acted as shock absorbers . By means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended or almost completely retracted into wells along the side of the fuselage . The following year , Captain Martin brought out another innovation . On an old De Havilland biplane he worked out the first @# split-axle landing gear , doing away with the spreader bar , which had long been a hazard on rough fields and in tall grass . Also in 1920 there appeared the first really retractable landing gear . A Martin design , this was fitted to the Dayton-Wright Gordon Bennett racer for the Army Air Corps . By means of a nut working on a threaded shaft , and a bicycle chain , the pilot cranked the wheels up and down by hand . This ship was the forerunner of such planes as the Grumman FF-1 , delivered in 1931 , the first military aircraft equipped with retracting gear . ' Boeing pioneered in hydraulic landing gear for big stuff in 1930 , fitting it to one of their Monomail models . To test its efficiency , they raced it against another Monomail , which had fixed gear with the best " pants " then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship far behind , with a speed difference of 15 miles an hour . Retracting gear for big aircraft was here to stay . Modern retracting gear is all basically the same , although the means and manner of operation vary . Some fighter planes , such as the Spitfire and the Messerschmitt 109F , retract the wheels outwardly toward the wing tips . The Focke-Wulf 190A and the Zero fold theirs inwardly , as do several American planes . Certain other American ships , including the Grumman Hellcat and the Curtiss P-40 , fold their " legs " straight back while the wheels themselves rotate 90 degrees to lie flat in the underside of the wings . It 's all a matter of the best method for the particular type of ship . In the big bombers , it has been found most convenient to retract the gear into the rear of the engine nacelles . In some cases , the wheels are only partly enclosed , while in others they are entirely buried within the ship . Some of the newest big ships include flaps that cover the fuselage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels are down . Sealing the jagged openings has in some cases reduced the take-off run as much as 15 percent and boosted the initial climb greatly . These flaps also serve to protect the interior of the wheel wells from dirt , mud , and rain . The pilot , of course , must know the exact position of his gear at all times . To provide for this , designers have worked out various devices for the instrument board . Some visual indicators have a small plane on the dial , whose wheels exactly follow the posi- tions assumed by the wheels of the actual craft ; a light flashes on when the wheels are down and locked in landing position . Audible warning systems use a horn , connected with the throttle , which blasts in the pilot 's ear if he closes the throttle coming in for a landing with his wheels still up . Getting the wheels up and down safely is but one side of the problem : there are still many details to confront the gear designer . For example , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under top impact loads There must be at least nine inches clearance for the whirling blades at all times , regardless of the landing or runway surface . Modern Aerol-type shock absorbers seen . to be the perfect solution for all problems encountered to date . This unit consists of a combination air-oil , shock-absorbing strut which forms the main leg of the gear itself One portion of the leg telescopes within the other to form a piston which forces air and oil into a chamber within the leg . The compression qualities of these two substances absorb the shock and , with the aid of linkage devices and valves , control the rebound of the gear to assure smooth , safe landings . Problems met in designing landing gear for helicopters and autogiros include the consideration of vertical as well as oblique impact loads . Designers of ski landing gear have their own particular problems . The landing gear of seaplanes I not flying boats ) is usually one of two types .

The latter type is seldom used on military combat craft but has beer . successful on planes ranging from small private craft to ships the size of the Douglas DC-3 airliner . What the future holds in the way of new landing-gear types is problematical ; but with rocket planes and superhigh-speed , jetpropelled aircraft in prospect , it may be that the problems of the gear designers have just begun .  |
