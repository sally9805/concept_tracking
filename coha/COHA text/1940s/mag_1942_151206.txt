New York Herald Tribune Correspondent Sonia Tomara , who has seen for herself , last week told how the early spring might delay a mechanized attack on the central front : <P> " The cold persists , with a few days of thaw here and there , through February and March . And then , rarely earlier than April , comes the big thaw , when the country is flooded with water that oozes from the earth , that runs with a merry sound , telling people and animals that the spring is near . <P> " Thus Hitler 's soldiers still have a long time to suffer from the Russian Queen of Snows . They will freeze for two months yet . Their war machines will refuse to obey the fair-haired boys who thought , until they went to Russia , that they were the lords of creation . And then , later , the German Army will know what early spring is in Russia ; nature gone mad with the return of sun . Few fortifications can hold out against torrents of water . Wheels will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fall that Russian mud halted their advance . Wait till they see the early spring . "
