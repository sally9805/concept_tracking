Mount Shuksan in Washington 's Cascades is a 9,030-ft. mass of snow fields , glaciers , crevasses , waterfalls , rock chimneys ( vertical crevices ) . Mount Rainier is higher ( 14,408 ft . ) ; Mount Baker is more difficult , less dangerous ( although six climbers died on its slopes last year ) . <P> For experienced amateurs who like the fun and peril of mountain climbing , Shuksan is just right for a Sunday outing . <P> On a Shuksan outing last week went three competent climbers : H. Karl Boyer , 28 , of Seattle , who fought in the Spanish Civil War ; Anne Cedarquist , 22 , a chemist who once climbed California 's hazardous Lassen Peak ; Faye Plank , 37 , a Bremerton librarian . Miss Cedarquist had climbed Rainier twice this year , Boyer once . They expected to be up to Shuksan 's peak and safely down by nightfall . <P> Roped together , Boyer and Miss Cedarquist got to within 1,000 ft. of the peak . Miss Plank , climbing alone , was several hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Boyer and over a cliff . He seized the rope , burned his hands as he belayed it around an outcropping rock and stopped the fall . Boyer inched along a narrow ledge , looked over , saw that Miss Cedarquist was badly hurt but for the moment safe-half dangling , half propped on another ledge , above a long snow field and a deep crevasse . He could not pull her up without more help than Faye Plank could give . <P> Boyer hurried down the mountain to summon aid from Seattle . Through the afternoon , night and next morning , Faye Plank sat alone on a six-inch ledge , fighting sleep and listening to the noisy growl of the waterfalls . She had to watch the rope and hold it jammed in a crevice with her boot heels . Said she : " I could hear Anne down below . At first she was just moaning . But when it got dark she began calling . . . . Night lasted a long time , but the early morning was the worst . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescuers saw Anne Cedarquist waving to them from her icy ledge . <P> They clambered gingerly to her , strapped her to a stretcher . They secured the stretcher with a long rope which they snubbed to ice axes rammed into the snow . All afternoon six men carried the stretcher while three others paid out the rope , foot by foot , then found another purchase for the axes and eased the stretcher a little farther down the mountain . Barefoot , lest his ironshod boots slip on the rocks , another rescuer climbed to exhausted Faye Plank , got her safely down as well . A doctor at Bellingham discovered that Anne Cedarquist had a punctured lung , a fractured shoulder , severe sunburn from the reflected glare of ice and snow , but , barring complications , would live for another Sunday on Shuksan.
