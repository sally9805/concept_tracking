Southerners have usually blamed a lot of their economic troubles on a handful of Northern villains . Among them : absentee owners of Southern industry , tariffs which raised the price of products bought by the South , higher freight rates , and even the lingering effects of the Civil War . <P> But last week , in a hard-hitting , 55,000-word analysis of the South by the National Planning Association Committee of the South , the Northern villains were brushed away as myths . N.P.A. , which has Southern businessmen , farmers and educators among its members , pinned the blame for the South 's plight squarely on its low level of production and the low productivity of the Southern worker . This , said N.P.A. , was caused to some extent by climate and poor health , but mostly by lack of education and industrial training , by primitive industrial processes and obsolete working equipment . Neither natural nor capital resources , said N.P.A. , have been developed in ratio to the population . The birth rate , at 25 per 1,000 , was nearly 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while per capita annual income was only $276 compared with $567 elsewhere . <P> To boost the Southern standard of living , N.P.A. suggested that new capital investment of $4 to $5 billion annually should be encouraged " from whatever source available , " including absentee Northern owners . N.P.A. also proposed that the South should shift its emphasis from agriculture to industry . Agricultural workers should move into factories and the number of " uneconomically small farms " should be reduced . On the other-hand , the number of medium-sized mechanized farms should be increased , and some of the cotton and tobacco farming replaced by diversified crops . Above all , there should be " larger output per capita " in industry and agriculture . <P> Also needed , said N.P.A. , was a change in U.S. tax policies that would help the South to help itself . A nationwide increase in personal income-tax exemptions would give Southern purchasing power a greater boost than the rest of the U.S. , because so many Southerners are in the lowest income bracket . Corporation taxes should also be lowered for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater part of industrial expansion " in the South . Warned N.P.A. : if stiff tax rates prevent the accumulation of capital for that expansion , " the main driving force for Southern industrial development will be eliminated . "
