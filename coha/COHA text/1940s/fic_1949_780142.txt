 | " It is to be for a year , then ; " she said . She paid no more attention to the driver than if he had been one of his own horses . " Will they both come back for her then , do you think ? " " He did n't say , " old Perrault said . " Perhaps he thought it best not to say . One imagines it will be for her to decide such things . " " She wo n't come with him , " Ruhama said . " That 's what she thinks , anyway . She thinks she 's going to be dead by then . " " Women think that about themselves at certain times , " Maruca said . " It would be a pity if it were true , though . To start a fire and then leave it for somebody else to put out , that would be a pity . And there might be trouble in finding anyone who could , now . " " There is always the Great Eastern , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She almost never used Spanish in speaking to him . " Your manners ! " They lapsed into silence . The lights of Natchez-under-theHill glared and shivered and swirled in the smoke from the pitch-flares below them , and the noise of pianos clattering , men whooping , and barrels thumping down the dock lifted past them through the gentle clatter of the wagon and the creaking of the venerable harness . It was a long time from that night before Ruhama was able to understand what a reference to the Great Eastern had to do with anybody 's manners .  | C H A P T E R S E V E N OLD PERRAULT 'S HOUSE STOOD NEAR THE EDGE OF THE UPPER town , on a side-street lined its full length with tall water-oaks and cedars and china-trees . It was isolated from the river so completely that not even the sounds from it were audible except when one of the big steamboats whistled , and even that was subdued by distance and intervening topography to a mild rumble , like a stir of summer thunder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall hedge shutting off the street where white and colored children worked together at building play-castles in the dust , and Choctaw Indians wandering down to spend their cotton-picking money occasionally loitered to stare in at the outlandish spectacle of plain grass being cultivated for its looks . Some of the houses along the side-street were pretentious , with colonnades and galleries and formal gardens in the European style , with everything that did n't want to grow being forced to , and everything that did being restrained and reshaped by clipping to look like something else . Living in a place where the rowdy district could be kept to itself under a hill stimulated the residents of the upper town to a deeper feeling of attachment to their surroundings than people in most of the river-towns did . There was one wealthy old Frenchman , Mathurin David , who had a big colonnaded house out on the bluffs beyond old Perrault 's side-street , which the government wanted to buy up for a military-hospital during the trouble with Mexico , and asked him to put a price on . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in selling , but that he might consider buying up the government , if the gentlemen in charge would quote him a reasonable price on that . He was considerably relieved when nobody took him up on his counter-offer ; he would n't have known what to do with the government if he had got it , he was wont to explain , and it would have cost far more to maintain than it was worth . Old Perrault 's house was older and more modest in appearance than any of the places around it . He cultivated a rundown air about it deliberately . Using it for his work and to receive customers in , he had found that a certain amount of dilapidation gave him an advantage in bargaining about prices . The house had been built originally of logs , hewn square and calked between the chinks with run-lime . The outside had afterward been sheathed over with whitewashed pine boards , to keep it abreast of the more modern vogue for elegant flimsiness , but the solidness of the structure still showed where the doors and windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pale gray that suited the slightly off-plumb set of the sides better than the original white had . The roof was split-cedar shakes , aged to a slightly darker gray than the sides , but weather-tight and sound . The house itself consisted of a long hall connecting two smaller wings that thrust out past it at either end so that it had the shape of a shallow rectangle with the base missing . The roof was carried straight across between the wings to form a long veranda the full length of the hall , curtained across its front by trellises of morning-glory , honeysuckle and climbing-roses . The kitchen was behind the house , separated from it by about twenty feet . It was a small square cabin , also made of logs but not boarded over . It was equipped with a large fireplace for baking , and a charcoal hearth , something like a country blacksmith 's forge , for smaller cooking . Behind it was another small log-cabin , also equipped with a fireplace , but with only a dirt-floor . It had been designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the work about the place and had notions about outside help , it was never occupied . The big hall connecting the two wings of the house was the main living-room . The furniture in it was made of plain oak by some local carpenter , without any attempt at ornamentation . The floor was plain flatboat-lumber , and the wall-finish merely the lime-chinking of the logs spread out and smoothed down . The wall-decorations represented , maybe unintentionally , the various changes of direction old Perrault 's hopes and ambitions had undergone during his years in the New World . There were some glassed-in cards of butterflies and dried lizard-skins , none of them unusual , from the period when he still thought of going back to his own country , where even the commonest specimens of American animal-life would have been considered novel and instructive . There were some patriotic engravings , from the time when he had given up that notion and had decided to stay and grow up with the country  --  General Washington reading his Farewell Address , the Signing of the Declaration of Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet-potatoes piled on a slab of bark , General Jackson winning the Battle of New Orleans by pointing his sword at a fortification of cotton-bales which , according to men who were there , had not been used because they caught fire , though they looked well enough in the picture . After that , as a sign that he had finally succeeded in putting his origins and traditions completely behind him , there had ensued a period of reaching back after them , indicated by some steel-engravings of French historical scenes , mostly from Napoleon 's campaigns , and a few hazy-looking illustrations for Lamartine 's poems . Lastly , there was a newer scattering of ordinary patent-medicine color-prints depicting famous steamboats , the New Madrid earthquake and the burning of St. Louis , which marked the final phase of his  | acclimatization . They were the sort of common chromos that traveling-salesmen handed out to build up good-will among back-country customers , and his tacking them up showed that , though he had at last reconciled himself to being no more pretentious in his wall-adornments than other people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . It was something that the traveling-salesmen considered him worth squandering their chromos on . They did n't hand such things around to everybody . Somewhere between those phases of his recession into permanence , there had been a sort of digressive period , marked by a group of plaques and medallions and framed embroideries from the hand of his wife , who had died in one of the yellow-fever epidemics that spread up the river sometimes , nobody knew how or why . She had employed a technique that wavered delicately between oversimplified drawing and overelaborated needlework to fill it in . Her most ambitious work was a carefully-ruled picture of a French castle in winter , the roofs and landscape done in some glittery stitchwork to resemble snow , and the doors , windows and loopholes all filled in with scarlet silk , giving an effect of internal feverishness where she had meant only to hint at warmth and cheeriness . She had also done some designs for ladies ' dresses , with the models ' heads and hands and feet drawn in pen-and-ink and the dresses made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tucks and gathers in real needlework and in exact scale . The amount of work their painstaking delicacy and accurateness represented was stupefying to think of . Old Perrault said she had never made any of the dresses for herself ; the material would have been prohibitively expensive , for one thing . His wife had not been skimpy in build , as American women mostly were . She had been large and abundant , pretty to look at , and with room enough for all her charms to spread out in . He sculptured the air around himself to illustrate nature 's open-handedness in shaping her , blinked his eyelids ,  | which were brown and dry-looking like pecan-shells , and sighed to think how long it had been since he had last looked at her dress-designs on the wall . He felt no regrets over what they signified . She had wanted dresses they had n't been able to afford , yes ; but designing miniatures of them had kept her mind occupied as agreeably , and with less sense of responsibility afterward . If she had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear them , whereas the miniatures could be hung on the wall and forgotten , as in fact they had been . There were few things in old Perrault 's past that he regretted or felt bitter about . It was not that he lacked material for repining , but he felt that it was useless and wasteful . He was undoubtedly right , except that there were times when a little of it would have been natural and becoming , which his mild and even-tempered conviction that everything had been for the best sometimes was not . He had gone through some hard scrabbling in his life , probably at the period when his wife was pasting scraps of silk on squares of pasteboard to represent the kind of dresses she hankered after . It had been a time when France was running through one of its periodic political storms , and he had thrown up his regular work and set himself to perfect an improved gun-lock as his contribution to the cause of liberation . But the liberation-movement proved to mean no more than the others had , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned out to be too complicated for use in the field , so he threw over the idea of using his skill for the improvement of mankind , and went back to cultivating his rosegarden and working at his regular trade , more convinced than ever of the vanity of human ambition and competitiveness . He believed in contentment with small blessings , the smaller the better . He held that a man achieved no more , in the long run , by gouging and elbowing after something everybody wanted than he did by schooling himself to find pleasure in the things most people passed by without noticing : a new  | color of rose in his garden , for example , or a searchinglyturned phrase in a book of poetry . It was true that he never noticed any new rose in the garden unless Maruca pointed it out to him , and never ventured in his poetry-reading beyond half-a-dozen old books that he already knew by heart and could reel off with his eyes shut , but those small discrepancies did not detract from his sincerity of belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his doctrine that he drew his comfort from , but the doctrine itself : like Don Quixote drawing pride and dignity from a pasteboard helmetvisor that anybody could have knocked to pieces with a broomstick . Old Perrault had at least developed a market for the work he turned out that made it possible for him to practice his doctrine of non-competitiveness , strictly and literally . By trade he was a watchmaker , but he had discovered a wider field for his skill than merely patching up the town 's output of broken timepieces . The universal gambling-house game then was faro . It was played with a full deck of cards , which , to safeguard the customers against dishonesty in dealing , was held in a metal box , open at the top , framed in at the edges so the dealer could touch only the top card in dealing it out , and fitted with a slot at one end through which he could deal only one card at a time . As with all inventions intended to ensure honest gambling , it had been followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worked out two improved styles of dealing-box that , with reasonable judgment in handling , could achieve the desired result without either nerve-racking uncertainty or risk of detection . One had a spring-slot which could be widened to let out two cards at a time , and then narrowed back again in case the customers developed suspicions and insisted on inspecting it . It was called a " sand-tell , " because the critical cards to be used in it had to be roughened slightly with sandpaper to make them stick together when a two-card deal was called for . The other  | box was arranged so that a small needle-point stuck out against the dealer 's finger when a big card was about to come up . It was called a " tongue-tell . " The cards used in it had to be carefully shaved down beforehand , with the tellcards left a little wider than the others to move the needle , which worked on a watch-spring from inside . There was nothing especially complicated about either of the box-designs , but the measurements had to be precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capable of standing rough treatment . There was always danger , when a faro-game was at its height , that some hard loser would grab the dealing-box and hurl it to the floor in a fit of rage . To have a box belch forth a lot of clockworks when it landed was a possibility that not even the boldest card-artist cared to risk . The simplicity and sturdiness of old Perrault 's dealing-boxes made them in steady demand over the entire country . He had filled orders for them not only all the way up and down the river and its tributaries , but from such far-off places as New York , Washington , Philadelphia , California , and even Boston . He made them of silver , and used imported watch-springs for the inner workings , so the material for one box cost him , on an average , about fifteen dollars . Still , he could turn them out finished at the rate of six or eight a week when there was any urgent need , and his price for them was a hundred and seventy-five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not carried him completely out of touch with everyday practicality , after all . He did all of his work by daylight , except when rush-orders had piled up , and he worked the most steadily when Maruca was outside in the garden where he could keep track of her and Ruhama was installed in a corner of his workshop where he could talk to her as he worked , alternating reminiscences about himself with scraps of poetry from Lamartine and La Fontaine 's Fables and the literary page of the New  | Orleans Picayune . The poetry from the Picayune was in English , and he prided himself on having enough grasp of the language to appreciate its lyric beauties , which , in the samples he picked to quote , were not much . He dealt out Lamartine and La Fontaine in French , supplying a running translation as he went along . La Fontaine stood the treatment reasonably well . It was easy for Ruhama to keep up with his animalstories ; the older Indians back in Crow Town had told stories in which the characters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamartine 's diaphanous numbers did n't come out nearly so well ; some of them sounded actually maundering and foolish . Old Perrault insisted that the trouble was in his translating , which missed all the verbal music and feeling . When Ruhama got able to follow the French all the way through without any growth in sympathy for either the writing or the writer , he said the sentiments were probably too mature for her . She would develop a deeper appreciation and understanding of them as she grew older . One needed a certain fullness of experience before such things could reveal themselves in their true poignancy . Ruhama inquired a little wickedly whether Maruca had been through experiences enough to appreciate them in their true poignancy . Old Perrault was taken considerably aback by having Maruca brought into it . He squinted down the groove of the dealing-box he was working on , and ran his polishing-wheel on it hard for several minutes while he thought it all out . " There is a certain point in these things , " he said , rubbing his thumb absently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " A line , a boundary , a limit . Yes : a limit . One reaches it by living , by experience . When you have reached it , then you will understand the beauty of these poems : the beauties . Some of their beauties you will understand sooner , but not all till then . But also , it is possible to pass beyond that limit . One can live too far , one can experience too much . Maruca has lived through a great deal . Much  | of her life has been sad , wild , bitter ; yes , tragic . She is not capable of understanding the beauty of these poems because she has lived beyond them . She has gone farther in her life than they go , she has experienced too much , too ? Yes . More than most women ; perhaps more than anybody you have ever known . " " Not more than you , I guess , " Ruhama said , to draw him out a little . " It has n't hindered you from liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is a woman , " old Perrault said , and shut his eyes and touched the tips of his fingers to the seam in the dealing-box to make sure it was smooth . His eyelids looked so much like pecan-shells that it was always a little shock not to hear a click when he closed them . " Women do n't absorb experiences as men do ; at least , not generally . They respond more easily to things about them . Yes : respond . And there have been differences between her experiences and mine . Hers have been of a different order , a different character . Women are marked more deeply than men are by such things . You will learn that in time . Maruca is different from other women only in having experienced much more than they have ; much more . " Not such a great sight more , I guess , " Ruhama said . She should n't have argued , but it rankled her to have experience and understanding held up as something she could n't expect to attain until sonic vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen enough of Sedaya to set a pattern from , at least . Maruca 's roster of experiences might not have been the same , but it could n't have been much more striking . " I do n't suppose she 's ever killed anybody . I know what they 're like when they 've done that . " She regretted that she had let herself go that far , but old Perrault did n't follow it up . His mind was still on Maruca . " She has never killed anybody , " he said , after a moment of reflection . " She has never spoken of such a thing to me , at  | least . I think she would have , if it had happened . There was a time once when she would have killed a man , if it had been possible . But it was n't . Nothing came of it . It was the first time she had ever contemplated such a  --  such extreme measures , I think . Otherwise it might have ended differently . " He glanced out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test-pack of cards into the dealing-box he had been polishing . " When I deal out two cards at once , tell me . Has Maruca ever spoken to you of having killed anybody ? " " She 's never said anything to me at all , about anything , " Ruhama said . It was almost true . Maruca 's reminiscences had been almost as prim and decorous as a campaign-biography . In spite of that , Ruhama regretted more than ever that she had opened the subject to begin with . Old Perrault slid cards from the dealing-box , and she watched them with a curious absorption , almost as if she had a bet riding on one of them . Queen wins , nine loses ; five wins , jack loses ; trey wins , seven loses ; nine wins , ace loses ... . " I dealt two cards at once twice , " old Perrault said , and slid the box across to her . " You can deal out the rest , while I work on this other one . I should have them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , and see if you can tell which cards are not trimmed . It was a strange story , the one about Maruca . It is strange that she has n't spoken of it to you . Unless she still has regrets about it . She may still have . " " She 's never spoken of it , " Ruhama said . She slid the cards out one at a time , holding her finger-tips where the pin-point would touch when it came out . Old Perrault fitted a watchspring in another box , adjusted the tension carefully , and said it had been a long time ago . Maruca had not been in the country long enough to have learned much English , or much of anything else . She had hired herself out to a man who ran a freighting-station down to some tide-flat settlements in Texas , and he listed her as a slave among his assets in negotiating a loan , so that when she wanted to leave he refused to  | let her . She had got the scar on her cheek from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down with yellow fever so desperately that he could n't move . The rains had set in and there was no travel because of the mud . She had to take care of him all by herself . " The king 's one of the tell-cards , " Ruhama said , and slid it out . " I do n't see , though , if she wanted to leave him , why she did n't pick up and do it . He could n't hinder her if he was too sick to move , could he ? " Old Perrault agreed that the king was one of the untrimmed cards , and cautioned her that there was , another . " She could have left the freighting-station except for one thing , " he said , getting back to Maruca again . " The country around it was wild , she was new in it , and she was afraid . She had been frightened : intimidated . She knew little English . She had been told that the country was swarming with poisonous snakes , tarantulas , alligators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if she escaped all these she would be put in jail for having entered the country illegally . So she stayed . Then I came to the freighting-station . I could understand Spanish very well then . Naturally , she explained her situation to me , and asked about all the dangers she had been told of . When I assured her that they were nonsense , and she saw that I knew the country and had horses , pistols , a rifle , and that I was French , she gained courage . She was for leaving immediately . Almost immediately . She thought we should first kill the man who had kept her there and lied to her so shamelessly . She thought that while he was helpless would be a good time to do it . " " But you said she did n't do it , " Ruhama said . She stopped dealing , and slid the top card halfway out , fingering the side of the box lightly . " The other tell-card 's a ten . There 's two of them together . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ? " " The ten is right , " old Perrault said . " Ten and king are the  | two tell-cards , and when two cards of the same value come together , it is called a split . It is true , she only wanted to kill him . I advised against it . It seemed useless brutality . The man was completely helpless , and he was dying . He could n't move , except to turn his eyes on me when she argued for killing him , and back to her when I argued for merely leaving him as he was . It was very trying ; yes , embarrassing . It was our first argument , the first difference we had ever had , and over such an undeserving subject ; yes , unpleasant . He was a coarse type , not in the least worth our quarreling about . However , I won . She gave in , unwillingly , and we went away and left him as he was . I could almost have killed him myself , at the last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friction . But that would have meant giving in to her . I knew better than to do that . " " Then you went away and left him there to die all by himself ? " Ruhama said . At that , it might have been as good a way to die as any , she thought . Old Perrault laid his work to the polishing-wheel , sighted across it critically , and said that had n't been exactly it , either . " We went on arguing about him after we had left , " he said . " For hours afterward ; until long after dark . Then she admitted that she had been in the wrong . It would have been childish to take the life of such a creature merely to punish him , merely to gratify her vindictiveness . It would have been too little : she admitted that . Only , she wanted to assure herself beyond any doubt that he was dead . If there remained even a remote possibility that he had got well , that he was still alive somewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his property , it would haunt her and destroy her peace of mind . And in that I could understand her point of view . Vengeance and punishment are not important , but peace of mind is . So we struck our camp and rode back all those miles in the dark to the freighting-station to make sure that he was dead . I held the lantern at the door for her , and she took one  | of my pistols , ready-loaded and cocked , and went in . Into the room where we had left him : yes . She was perfectly calm ; we both were . There was not a tear from her , not a sigh , nothing . The intensity of her emotion , the importance of our errand , had completely checked her natural flow of feelings . She moved as one in a dream . I remember thinking that at the time . " " And he was dead ? " Ruhama said . She spoke in a kind of supplicating whisper , though she recognized the part about tears , sighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Perrault had read it to her himself . He shook his head . " We could n't be sure ; we could n't find him , " he said . " He was not in the room where we had left him . He was not in the freighting-station at all . Someone had come with a wagon and taken him away . So it appeared from the marks in the mud , at least . Since then , we have had reason at different times to feel certain he is still alive . So there was no harm done , after all ; except in our blaming each other about it , maybe . Maruca has blamed me at times for not letting her kill him when there was an opportunity . I have blamed her for going back to find out about him . It would have been better if we could have gone on thinking he had died , I thought . I may have been wrong . Maybe it is for the best as it is . She would have left long ago , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might go and tell him where she was , and then he would kill her for wanting to kill him , and for running away . Or I might have ordered her out a dozen times over , maybe , except that she would go and tell him where to find me . Then he would kill me for taking her away . So we have gone on like this , and now we'are used to each other , so maybe it is for the best . There is somebody at the gate , I think . If it is the man from the up-river boat , ask him to wait ; talk to him , or something . I am finishing the last of his boxes now . "  | Ruhama went out to the gate . It was past sundown , and Maruca had lit the living-room candles and the carriage-lamp over the workshop-door before going back to the kitchen . It had been raining a little . There were glitters of it in the grass , and a dark knot of cloud trailed a flame-colored wake back across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bubble being blown thin . There had never been so many roses ; there were banks , cascades , freshets of them rising from the loose petals Maruca had dropped in clipping them , brightened with the rain , at peace . People could be held together as firmly by distrust as by love , and , in the end , find it as peaceful and like it as well ; unless there was something more to it that old Perrault had n't mentioned . She hoped there was . The man waiting at the gate was young , dressed in rough country homespun and a slouch hat , with his coat-collar turned up against the rain spattering from the trees . He came in without speaking when she opened the gate , and then stood back against it and took his hat off and turned down his collar . " I remembered that you 'd come up here to stay awhile , " he said . " I was n't sure you 'd still be here , but I thought I 'd come up and see , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading , and I saw our old salt-boat pulled up on the mud down in Wolf-Trap Row , so I thought I 'd find out what had become of you . You ought to tell me how much I 've grown , so I can return the compliment . Then we 'll have that out of the way , and you can tell me how Maruca and old Perrault are . " It was young Savacol , who had read Latin and practiced pistol-shooting when they were on the salt-boat coming down the river . Ruhama was n't sure whether she was glad to see him or not . He looked better than she remembered him ; less weedy , easier-mannered , more at home with his hands and feet , but there was something a little off-key about him , something behind his bantering offhandedness that was  | strained and alert and wary . She said she had n't grown any more than she could help , and added , in the hope of finding out what he really had come for , that Maruca was in the kitchen behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some work that had to go out on the boat . He would be done with it before long , she thought . " We wo n't interrupt him , " young Savacol said . " I know how important a set of rigged gambling-tools can be . Cardus waxicus , or a fool and his money are soon parted , as the saying is . It 's a great country where people will pay higher to be swindled than they would for an honest day 's work , but we must n't criticize . I 'll look in on him before I leave ; Maruca too , maybe , not that she ever had any use for me . They do n't object to your having callers , do they ? " The question had never come up , because she had never had any . She was a little suspicious that he was making fun of her , but the novelty of the thing seemed worth the risk , and she took him into the living-room and set out a chair and took his hat and apologized for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if receiving visitors was a regular event with her . He regretted having to miss the album , and then , being constitutionally able to talk the most volubly when his inner uneasiness was the deepest , he let in to telling about the places he had been since leaving the saltboat : keeping payroll for a firm of railroad-contractors in East Texas , clerking at a mule-auction in St. Louis , keeping books on a Missouri River steamboat , and the like . He had covered a lot of territory . He interrupted himself in telling about it once , hearing voices outside , but it was only somebody to see old Perrault . Maruca opened the gate and let the visitor in without disturbing the living-room , so young Savacol went back to telling about railroad-building across the Trinity River Bottoms , the egrets and blue herons , pink flamingoes and water-turkeys , the stories about green rattlesnakes that could fly , the twenty-foot alligators that came out every morn-  | ing before daylight and fought over the cook-tent garbage , roaring like the trump of judgment and dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privilege of rooting in a pile of beef-bones and potato-peelings ; and about the emigrant-wagons that came dragging past from the wornout plantations in the east , hunting for new land along the railroad . They were always in the same state of dilapidation , the wagon-covers stained and ragged , the wheels lopsided and out of line , the harness patched with rope and string and pieces of cloth . They were always in the same order of march : first a bright-looking young Negro on horseback with the best gun , watching the road ahead for game ; then a pack of lank hounds , sore-footed and sore-eared ; then a dozen or so assorted Negroes , dull-eyed with fatigue and dripping with mud that they were too tired to avoid ; then the wagon , with the owner trudging beside the oxen with a club to keep them moving , his wife and children jouncing limply in the front seat , an uncountable swarm of pickaninnies staring wall-eyed from among the piled-up furniture in the back . Mostly they had no idea where they were going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were generally more hopeful than the men ; more practical and logical , with a better hold on themselves under strain . He had seen many more sights , but there was no use trying to tell about all of them . It was time for him to be leaving , anyway . " I did n't know there were that many things to see , " Ruhama said . She got his hat and followed him outside , halfway wishing he would stay longer , not that his conversation mattered much , but she had a feeling that Maruca would say something disapproving about his visit after he had left , and she wanted to put off having to hear it . It was true that Maruca had never had much use for him . " You must be finished with all that now , or you would n't be here . ' What are you doing now ? " " There 's not many things a book-learned young scrub with-  | out money or connections can do around these parts , " he said . " He can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gambler , or teach school . I 'm a school-teacher for the time being . Not the regular kind , with a primer in one hand and a switch in the other . I 'm a sort of  --  well , private tutor , you might call it . I do n't suppose it 'll last long . . . . That felt like more rain , and I must n't keep you outside in it . I 've got to see old Perrault a minute or two before I leave , if he is n't still busy . " It was irritating to have it come out that he had n't come calling entirely on her , after all , but before she could take him up for it the door of old Perrault 's shop opened , and his visitor came out . It was one of the gamblers from up the river : a young Italian named Charles Cora . He had not gained as much note then as he did subsequently , though his career already deserved some measure of it . He had been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the land-boom period , and picked up and cared for by a woman in one of the prostitutes ' tents till he was old enough to strike out for himself . He was fantastically ignorant , and also abnormally brash and thick-skinned , and since people usually take most readily to somebody to whom they can feel superior , he became a favorite with all who knew him , and was so well looked after that before he had passed his eighteenth year he had been able to take ninety thousand dollars away from the Vicksburg gambling-houses , and carry it away with him unchallenged and unscathed . His rise did n't reduce his brashness ; instead , it was his brashness that , after he had shifted his field of operations to California , finally reduced him . A San Francisco vigilance committee hauled him in for knifing a United States Marshal , and hung him before his blundering attractiveness had time to take hold on them . He was not as bad as he sounded , actually . He dressed plainly , attended diligently to his own business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He shut the door of old Per-  | rault 's shop behind him and stood with his hand on it , looking at young Savacol . " Now I remember you , " he said . " You 're that hustler for old Preacher Skaggs . I did n't know he 'd took to crooked tools for his gamblers . Where are you takin ' ' em , around here somewhere ? " " I 'm not a hustler , " young Savacol said haughtily , and glanced at Ruhama . " Not for old Skaggs or anybody else . I do n't know anything about crooked gambling-tools , or care . I do n't know anything about you , either , except that you 're in my way . Get away from that door , and go somewhere . " " I do n't believe I will , " Cora said . " I know you 're a hustler for old Skaggs , because I 've seen you with him . You 're bound to know something about crooked gamblin ' - tools , or you would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ai n't ashamed of it . If you are , why do n't you quit it ? " " I 'm not a gambler , and I do n't hustle for one , " young Savacol said . " That 's the second time I 've told you , and it 's the last . Do n't say it again unless you want to get hurt . " " A man can say what he pleases , " Cora said . " You ai n't any better than anybody else . I know you . I know all about you . You ai n't any better than I am . Or as good , as far as that goes . " He fished a twenty-dollar goldpiece out of his vestpocket , and flipped it into the gravel at young Savacol 's feet . " A little account I run up with a lady up the river a few hundred miles . I 'd aimed to pay her the next time I was up that way , but'you might as well have it . You 'd git it from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn , and pushed Ruhama back toward the living-room door . " You 've made a damned nuisance of yourself around this country the last time you ever will , " he said . " I 'll give you till I count three to draw . If you have n't done it by then , I 'll shoot you anyway . You 're wasting time triggering with that door . It wo n't open . "  | It was true . The door had a spring-lock inside , and it had fastened when it came shut . Young Savacol measured his ground with a swift side-glance , and took in Ruhama standing round-eyed at the edge of the veranda . " I thought you 'd gone , " he said . " You do n't belong here . Ca n't you see he 's working up nerve to shoot ? Go on inside . Hurry up about it . " " I wo n't do it ! " Ruhama said . She stepped from the veranda and planted herself in front of him . " What business have you got ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's property ? You 've got no business being here , either one of you ! Who asked you to come here , any-way ? " Young Savacol said nothing . Cora ventured to remind her that he had n't given any orders , and had been trying to stay out of a fight . She turned on him wrathily . He may not have intended to spoil everything for her , but it was spoiled , and she blamed him for it . " You would n't have needed to try if you 'd kept your mouth shut ! " she told him . His forehead was too narrow , anyway , and his lips an unpleasantly bright red . " If you want to stay out of a fight , go away from here ! Do n't stand there flapping your mouth and goggling , go on , leave , hurry up ! He wo n't bother you . If he tries to , I 'll bite his hand ! I 'll bite clear through it ! " Cora had been widely praised for one unobtrusive departure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning from the Vicksburg gambling-palaces . He made another one , equally successful and even more unobtrusive . Ruhama stood looking after him without paying any attention to young Savacol . The gate clicked shut , but she still did n't turn around . There would be more to say when she did , more to listen to , and there had already been too much . She wished it could all be over with . He began on his justification while she still had her back turned to him . " You 'll think I lied to you , I suppose , " he said . " That 's  | what it must look like , after what that loud-mouthed numskull said about me . I want you to know that ? " " Go on away from here ! " she said . Maruca had come into the living-room , and the thought of having to listen to her reproaches , after so much else , made her desperate . " Go on , do you hear ? If you do n't stop talking and leave , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She may have said worse ; she could n't be sure whether she had said it or merely thought it . She could n't be sure whether he saw Maruca in the living-room , or whether her threats made him realize the futility of reasoning with her . Whichever it was , it got rid of him . He bowed , swept his hat on with a fierce yank as if he was beating out a grass-fire with it , and stalked away . It was something of a relief that he slammed the gate behind him twice , so hard the whole fence rattled , because she felt that it might assuage his hurt feelings . As a further relief , Maruca said nothing about his visit . She merely remarked , when Ruhama went back inside , that supper would be ready in fifteen minutes , and that even if one did n't feel like eating it was better to make a stab at it , for the sake of routine . Having young Savacol treated as a closed incident was welcome , if only it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper to find it already done for . Old Perrault sat at the head of the table with his hands folded in front of him , staring moodily into his plate and saying nothing . Maruca explained that one of his business transactions had miscarried : an important one . It involved an order of six dealing-boxes which he had agreed to send out on the upriver steamboat without fail . They were for one of the biggestscale gamblers in the country , a man named Elijah Skaggs , known in gaming-circles as Preacher Skaggs because he always dressed and looked like a back-country circuit-rider . He had been brought up in complete illiteracy , which he made up for by employing a school-teacher to travel around with  | him , supply cultural background , help with bookkeeping , and run confidential errands for him . One of the confidential errands had been to bring the six dealing-boxes down to the steamboat for delivery to him in St. Louis . But the schoolteacher he had sent for them was young Savacol , and , between his set-to with Cora and Ruhama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had apparently forgotten all about them . They were still where old Perrault had laid them to be ready for him : six of them at a hundred and seventy-five dollars apiece . All told , they represented a value of over a thousand dollars , and they were to have been only a trial-order . Old Skaggs ' operations were extensive enough to have used five times that many , if only they had n't driven young Savacol away before he could attend to collecting them . " I drove him away , " Ruhama said . She understood now what he had wanted to explain to her . Ile actually was a school-teacher , as he had claimed . What had looked equivocal about it was that he was employed to bestow his tutelage on a professional gambler . Still , that was not the only thing about him that needed explaining . There was his pretending to be calling on her when he had actually been sent to collect gambling-equipment from old Perrault , and there was Cora 's hint about some woman up the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was glad she had driven him away . " The steamboat has n't left yet , anyway . It has n't whistled , and there 's always at least an hour after that before it leaves . " It was what they had wanted her to say ; she could tell it by the way they looked at each other . " We might not find him , " Maruca said . " Six of those boxes in one package , that would be too valuable for us to leave on a window-ledge or against the door of his cabin . " " You would n't need to find him , " old Perrault said . They had that part of it all settled already , perhaps without having actually discussed it . They were too used to each other for 113  | such things to need much prearranging between them . " The package has his name on it , and his employer 's name . You can leave it with the bookkeeper on the boat . Ask him to put it in the safe and give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man on the passenger-list , so it will be entirely safe . We should have thought of that in the beginning . You had better have the receipt made out to you , in your name . You understand , I would attend to all this myself , but it might cause embarrassment to a client : inconvenience , at least . There are professional ethics in these things . There is a wagon that goes down from the hotel before the boat leaves . " The question of professional ethics did n't interest Ruhama much . She was still thinking about young Savacol . " He could n't have left the boxes on purpose , for an excuse to come back again , could he ? " " He left them because he was too much upset to think of them , " Maruca said . " He had worked himself up to the point of committing manslaughter to impress you , and then you flew at him like that . You were n't very ladylike , and some of the things you said horrified him . Maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are going with me . " " I 'm going , " Ruhama said . There was an uncomfortable kind of seesaw in her feelings . She felt glad they were going down to the boat ; she wanted to be out in case young Savacol did come back . She hoped they would n't see him , remembering some of the unladylike expressions she had made use of before him ; but she would not have wanted to go if there had n't been a chance of seeing him , knowing that he had been trying to impress her . It was like a balance-sheet with debits and credits canceling each other out . The only item that came out uncanceled at the end was that she felt glad they were going .  | C H A P T E R EIGHT THE UP-RIVER STEAMBOAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG ONES , NAMED the Mazeppa . It was tied up with its bow laid against a dismantled steamboat-hulk that had been hauled aground and converted into an overnight hotel for traveling-men . All the lights were on in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and passengers were crowding along it to get on and being crowded by boys peddling newspapers and bright-dressed mulatto girls peddling big urns of fresh milk and buttermilk , oranges , candy made of pecans and brown sugar creamed together , hot pork-cracklings , corn-husk cigarettes and blue-black cigars , and smoking gobbets of readycooked fish , chicken and turkey . The steamboat bookkeeper was helping the purser to tally fares and verify tickets at the head of the gangplank . He was a red-complexioned young German with heavy-lensed spectacles and a scattered command of English , and he willingly resigned the task of explaining to each of the lower-deck passengers in turn the difference between a two-dollar fare and one at three dollars and a half , and drew aside while Maruca stated her errand . He made up for his slowness with English by his readiness in understanding what she wanted . He remembered young Savacol 's name among the cabin-passengers for St. Louis , and even remembered young Savacol himself , having had a short discussion with him about world literature a few miles above Arbuckle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were duly delivered , and to keep them in the boat 's safe in  | the meantime , and to give Maruca a receipt for them ; and he wrote one out in the hotel-office in painstaking German script , describing the package down to the trademark on the wrapping and the number of knots in the string with which it was tied . He also agreed , in case the boat left before young Savacol came aboard , to notify his employer in St. Louis that it was being held subject to orders . He was friendly and expansive , and would gladly have undertakcn to do more than that for them , merely as an excuse to string out the colloquy till the below-deck passengers all got herded aboard , but they could think of nothing else to ask him , so he put the package in his money-satchel and went back to his duties with a lagging tread . They stood for a few minutes watching him at work and listening to scraps of the conversation going on around them . It was the first crowd of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livelier ; the colors looked more vivid and shifting with the torchbasket flames blowing and lifting over them , the voices sharper and less everyday-sounding , heightened to something unreal . There was an unreality about all of it ; a group of steamboat-men behind her talking about happenings up the river sounded the most unreal of all , talking about how General Scott had blown out a joint at the Devil 's Elbow , and John C. Calhoun had busted six arms trying to land at Hard Times , and Diana had jammed her doctor and had to be towed into Memphis , and Fannie Kemble had broken loose and rammed the Wild Cat at Rising Sun . Discovering that those were merely the names of steamboats made it more sensible , but less interesting . The wagon from the hotel was not to start back up the hill for another fifteen minutes , and Maruca , being out by herself with noVI body to keep tab on her movements for the first time since she had ridden away from the freighting-station in Texas with old Perrault , felt light-spirited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few mild objections , that they  | would walk up through the district called Wolf-Trap Row and see what kind of remodeling their old salt-boat had uni dergonc . The rain had given the street a subdued tone , though the places were all blazing with light at every chink so that there was nothing shadowy or unsafe about it . The red-curtained houses kept their doors closed , holding in their light but quivering to the sound of music , dancing , and occasional fighting ; but the gambling-places were all open to the street and swarming with tinhorns , town-lawyers , dock-hands , traveling-men , cappers , steerers , hangers-on , and the type of small gambler called check-sweaters , from their habit of buying a quarter 's worth of chips and holding onto them all night in an agony of indecision , which they enjoyed as much as other people did gambling and winning . Old Perrault 's improved dealing-machinery was not used in any of the waterfront gaming-parlors . Their system for treading out the vintage was too simple and straightforward to require such expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they refused to pay off , and started a fight to distract his attention while the bank was being moved elsewhere . If he was too vigilant or too well-attended for that treatment , they paid him philosophically , and sent some trusty attendant to lay for him with a sockful of buckshot when he got to the first dark corner . The one gambling-resort with a name for scrupulously honest dealing was a flatboat-outfit run by a gigantic Negro named Buffalo Frank . He was built like a draft-horse , with arms as big around as an ordinary man 's waist , and was reputedly in the habit , when anybody was caught swindling at his tables , of taking the offender by one leg and throwing him out into the middle of the river . His place was run for colored steamboat-hands , but white customers were not barred , and it was patronized by some with whom the problem of race counted less heavily than that of getting a reasonable run for their cash . A little beyond the light-and-music section of the water-  | front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south , in bright-flowered shirts , fringed hip-leggings , and turbans made of colored shawls . They were scattered around the dimly-lighted log-wharf where some west-country flatboats were tied up , laden with farm-produce and fruits of the land and forest from back in the Arkansas hills . Each boat had a list of the merchandise it carried lettered in chalk along its planking , with a lantern hung above so it could be read by late passers-by : fresh pork , beef , butter , lard , corn , potatoes . One list mentioned apples , and another included combhoney . There was a kind of innocence about such things in such a place , to anybody who did n't know how the westcountry flatboats operated . Ruhama loitered past them , reading the lists over and comparing them with one another . An Indian sat up among the driftwood at the edge of the mudflat , propped his head heavily on his hands , and began to make deathly noises . She stopped , horrified , and Maruca caught her by the arm and hurried her on down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they got where the light was better . " Those Arkansas flatboatmen will sell whiskey to anybody who can pay for it , and these poor creatures have their wages saved up from cotton-picking . It is wrong to feel sorry for them , maybe . They worked hard all summer for this , and now they have it . For anything better , they would n't have worked at all . Yonder is our old salt-boat , opposite the lights ; the one with the old woman sitting outside the door . Is that a baby she is holding ? That is odd , a baby in a place like that . It ca n't possibly be hers . She is too old , she looks almost seventy . Why is she sitting there with it , do you suppose ? I have half a notion to go and ask her . " " We 'd better go back , " Ruhama said . The salt-boat had been rebuilt so it looked exactly like all the others flanking it : there was a flat-roofed house built completely over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end with a lamp burning on each side of it . When the door opened ,  | the sound of music and heavy-footed dancing came drifting out . Sometimes the light from one of the doors reached back into the shadows and fell on a drunk Indian staggering an ti aimless circle before lying down in the mud to sleep it off . The door of a house across the street opened , and a man fell out , scrambled to his hands and knees , and began crawling hurriedly away , his yellowish beard dipping in the mudpuddles as he paddled through them , while another man stood in the door and threw wooden chairs at him , swearing whenever one missed . There was the sound of a shot somewhere , and of women quarreling and trying to outyell each other , and of glass breaking with a sharp pop and tinkle , and of the dark river lapping quietly among the rushes and driftwood and drunk Indians . It had n't been worth coming for . " We 'd better go back , " Ruhama said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old woman like that . You can see she 's Indian . She 'll let on not to understand what you 're saying . All these Choctaw squaws do . " " It is foolish , I suppose , " Maruca said , smiling to herself . It was clear that she considered that no disadvantage . It was her first chance in years to do something foolish without being raked down for it afterward , and she was out to make the most of it . She went hurriedly along the plank-walk that led up to the salt-boat , leaving Ruhama watching from the road . It was impossible to hear what she said to the old Indian woman , or what answer she got . Whatever the conversation amounted to , it did n't last long . It was n't much over a minute till she came hurrying back to the street again . She looked subdued and a little uneasy , and she turned back toward the steamboat-landing in silence , walking fast and not looking back . It was not until they were well past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians were scattered the thickest that she took breath to talk . " She would n't say anything to me , " she said , still hurrying . " She would only cluck and shake her head . She was sell-  | ing cigars and red peppers ; both from the same sack , it appeared . The baby is n't hers . I made sure of that much . " " It might be , though , " Ruhama said , hurrying to keep up . " These Choctaw women always look twenty years older than they are . Some of them look that old when they 're not much past thirty . " " It is n't hers , " Maruca said , and looked sideways at her . " No . It is not even the same kind of Indian that she is . I know Indians ; I was brought up among them . She is Choctaw , yes . The baby is not .... Look , the hotel-wagon is starting , we must hurry ! " " It 'll have to come past here to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 'll stop for us , if we wait . What kind of Indian did you think the baby was ? " " What kind of ? " The wagon was coming toward them . Maruca stopped and looked down at her feet reproachfully . " I am foolish tonight . Think of it , hurrying to catch the wagon when it was coining toward us ! . .. I do n't know what kind of Indian the baby was ; I do n't know . I know nothing about the Indians of this country , nothing . I should n't pretend to ; you should n't pay any attention to me . When you get into the wagon , do n't get mud from the wheel on your dress . It was clean this morning , and I am tired of ? I wish the wagon would hurry . Why are they walking the horses ? " There were no other passengers in the wagon going back up the hill . They sat in the back , among some trunks being taken to the upper hotel for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded a point of the grade where they could look straight down the full length of the waterfront street and pick out the places they had passed on it . It was sedate enough as far as looks went . Even the noises were subdued by distance to a light clattering hum that was harmless-sounding and almost restful . In spite of that , Maruca began to talk suddenly about far-off subjects ,  | as if to keep some recollection of nearer things from forcing itself into her thoughts . She made several false starts , beginning with some reflection about men and leaving it unfinished to range through some of the things she had seen in her wanderings : sharks , pearl-fisheries , sponges that floated on the water and gave off a white light in the dark , and finally to the death of her husband , though she usually avoided speaking of that when she could . It had been on the slave-ship coming into the Caribbean Sea , and since it was cholera and the men were all scared of it , they dropped him overboard without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely dead . Maruca begged them to wait at least a little while first , thinking , because he had loved her even at the last , that a few extra minutes together would be that much more for both of them to remember afterward . She even fought to hold them back , but they went ahead and dropped him over in spite of her . When dark came they could see , by the light of the phosphorescence in the water around them , that his body was following the ship . There was no sign that it wanted to , or that it was thinking of such things any longer , but it did . It was as if the ship drew him after it . He followed wherever it steered , every turn , every tack . The men tried everything to get rid of him . They changed the ship 's course , and he changed his to conform . They threw pieces of meat overboard to draw the sharks , and the sharks merely ate the meat and went away again . They even lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he would sink , but the weights slipped off , and he caught up and resumed his dogging them as tirelessly as if nothing had happened . Finally , seeing that it was due to last no matter what they did , they took to blaming Maruca , insisting that it was all because she had fought so savagely to hold them back when they dropped him overboard . He lead got it into his head that he was entitled to those few extra minutes with her , they  | thought , and he would go on following the ship till they were somehow made up for . Some of them thought it was because she still loved him ; that he would go on following her till she stopped , or till they threw her overboard along with him . They were in favor of doing that , on the theory that if sensible remedies had n't worked , foolish ones might . They might actually have done it , though she swore up and down that she did n't love him any longer , that she was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been that they needed her to take care of the men who were still coming down with the cholera . They had spared her on that account , but it had been a narrow escape . " What became of your  --  of what was following the ship ? " Ruhama asked . The wagon had turned past the point from which the lower town was visible . There was nothing around them but the dark . Maruca roused out of her thoughts . " There came a storm , " she said " Tremendous winds , waves higher than this hill , two-thirds of the men sick or dying : five days of it . When it passed , there was nothing following us . We had forgotten all about my husband , the storm was so much more terrible . I had forgotten him too , the same as the men had . That may have been the reason he stopped following us . " She lapsed into thought again . The wagon topped the hill and turned into the upper town among the dark shadetrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like childishness here , like the ghost-stories Negroes tell to scare each other . Nobody here would believe such things had ever happened . In a place such as this , they could n't . But in places where people believe in them , they happen . What I have told you is what I saw . Not that it matters about that . The thing you must remember is that men ca n't always love where they would like to , or stop loving when they ought to . Not nearly so much as women can . A roan is not too much  | to blame for loving what is  --  well , bad for him . He does n't do it because he wants to ; he does it because he ca n't help it . You may not need to remember that , but it will be as well if you do remember it . Here is the hotel , we can walk from here . It might be as well , when we get home , not to say anything about going past all those waterfront places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wo n't tell , " Ruhama said . The dead man following the ship had given her a picture , of a kind : a man with eternity standing open for him who kept on tracking patiently through the water behind a ship because something he loved was on it : even though the ship was one he had been held captive on , even though it was laden with slaves and reeking with pestilence and death . It was better for Maruca that she had outlived her belief in such things , but it was impossible not to suspect that she had been a stronger and more selfcontained person while she still held it . Childish or not , there had been something about it that suited her . The dignity she still retained came mostly from her remembering it . The wisdom and common sense she had acquired since merely dimmed down what she had once been without quite concealing the outlines . Except for that , even wisdom and common sense would scarcely have kept her from seeming more than meddlesome and ordinary . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep listening to the windy-sounding roar in the leaves outside , thinking of flatboats , drunk Indians , and the look young Savacol had given her on leaving . It was mid-morning when old Perrault waked her by knocking at her door , and called through it that some news had come for her . It was still dark because of the rain , and she fumbled her clothes on by guess while he waited . When she opened the door , he came in , bringing a lighted candle . There were gray splashes on his boots where he had spilled wax from it , but the rest of his attire was ceremonious and elegant . He had on a full-bot-  | tomed tan coat with brass buttons , a brocaded vest , yellow trousers , and a ruffled shirt with a stand-up collar that reached clear to his ears . He held the candle unsteadily , and splashed more wax from it as he looked at her . He was deeply moved . " You must come to the living-room for your news , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like you to know . I would like you to know how much our lives here have been brightened since you have been with us : renewed , stimulated . For one of your years , it is no great privilege to be young . Youth can be sad ; yes , painful . I know that from my own experience . But if you could know how much your youth has meant to us , you would think it well worth all it has cost you ; the effort , the trouble . If you have learned something in return about contentment with small things , if we have ? Yes . It will be dark for us without you . " " It 's about my father ! " she said . He bowed his head , and decanted a striddle of melted candle-wax on the floor between his feet . She saw that there was something more to it . " You mean he 's come for me , he 's here ? Is anybody else ? is he alone ? " " Not altogether , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you mean it , yes . Yes , he is alone . The Indian woman is not with him . Nevertheless , he is not completely alone . " " You do n't mean lie 's found Elison ? " Ruhama said . If it was that , she would have to put on a better dress . Her hair would need fixing , too ; she had combed it by guess . " Is it my sister , has he brought her with him ? " " It is not that either , exactly , " old Perrault said . He seemed a little embarrassed . " At least , not in the sense that you ? You had better go to him , I think . That will be simpler for you . He is waiting . " The drumming of rain sounded louder in the living-room than it had in her bedroom . The candles in the wall-brackets were all burning . The light had strengthened so they were not  | needed to see by , but the flames helped against the chill and grayness . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fixing something about a clothes-basket on the floor . He got up and looked at her . He was so haggard and shadowy and gray-lined that she could n't speak . His mouth had a sidelong twist to it , and she had a moment 's horrified fear that he was about to laugh , but it was merely an effect of the light . There was nothing mirthful about him , to her relief . " They ai n't hurt you , anyway , " he said . " You look like you 'd come through all right . It 's about time something of mine did , by God ! " THE THING SHE NOTICED FIRST , HOLDING HER ARMS AROUND him , was how much taller she measured against him than she had , but that was only incidental . The changes she noticed most were in him . He had come through some hard traveling , and it showed on him . His clothes were homespun dyed with copperas , like everybody else 's from the country , but they were worn through at all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His boots were cracked and dust-burnt and worn through at the heel-counters from wearing heavy spurs . There was a raw cut across the knuckles of his right hand that he kept stroking absently , as if it had been put there to remind him of something . " I walked up from the steamboat-landing , " he said . " It was early , but I did n't have anything else to do , and Askwani wanted to ? " " Askwani ? " Ruhama said . She thought of the drunk Indians she had seen scattered around the Arkansas flatboats . " Is he here , do you mean he 's ? He did n't come in with those Choctaw cotton-pickers , did he ? " " He was n't with ' em the last I seen , " Warne said . " He was down lookin ' into the store-windows when I come up here .  | There was n't any of ' em open , so all he could do was look , but he had n't ever seen anything like ' em before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd pace up and see what kind of a place I 'd left you in , and maybe call around later on . But then old Perrault sighted me , and he thought we ought to call you . I do n't know what his hurry was . He thought you 'd want to know about me , I guess , but poor news wo n't spoil for keepin ' , and mine 's poor enough . One thing is that I 'm through with the Territory for good . I got all I wanted of that . I 'm out of it now , and I aim to stay out . " She asked how Sedaya had taken that development , after being so set on going to the Territory to begin with . He looked out the window , struck his cut knuckles against his knee thoughtfully , and said Sedaya was dead . It had been peaceable enough , he added after a little silence : one of the ailments common to places where new land was being broken to cultivation for the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many people , maybe because they insisted on being treated by native doctors who knew nothing about it . He had tried his best to head her off from it . He wanted to leave before she took down with it , and afterward he wanted to bring her out where there was some regular doctor , but she would n't hear to anything reasonable . It was not that she had any particular use for any of the Indian healers . Mostly it was that she had wanted to stand the same risks that the rest of her people were exposed to . There was some local politics mixed up in it , maybe . " There was a big fight on amongst the people around us . Not that there was anything new about that , but sometimes it dies down a little . This was one of the times when it was up again . Some of ' em was still mad because the government had moved ' em out there , and some of ' em thought it was all right , and they was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved out all by themselves before the removals , and they thought they owned the country and the  | others did n't have any right to be in it , so there was a fight over that . She did n't want to leave , because she thought she could help ' em to straighten it out . She worked at it , and trapesed around from one place to another till she took clown . They got one of their doctors , and he said some of his spells over her . That was all there was time for . It was n't wild or lonesome ; not any more than Crow Town would have been . I 'd had all I wanted of it by then , though . It was a good time to leave . " That was how it had ended for Sedaya . Love of her people had led her to her death , trying to settle a fight that love of their land had led them to start among themselves . Death was too vast and slow-paced to measure against anything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . She would have died somehow and some time if she had stayed in Crow Town , and she could n't have found any way to it in Crow Town that would have amounted to as much . It must have been somewhere near what she wanted , since she had refused to leave at the last . And if there had been no young Indian 's death to atone for , no betrayal weighing on her conscience , would she have ended any better ? No ; she would have ended as a squaw in Crow Town , hauling some loutish husband home from a Saturday night 's drunk and washing the mud and blood out of his one shirt on Monday morning , the same as all the others . Her betrayal of the young Indian was the only thing that had set her apart from them , and it had lifted her above them . Nothing else could have done it . " You did n't find Elison ? " Ruhama said . " I did n't find her , " Warne said , and stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for that yet , and I will . I 've had word a couple of times about the outfit she went away with . They 've been in cahoots with a pack of cattle-thieves down in the Chickasaw country . They pick the cattle up at the State line as fast as they 're rustled , and run ' em north and  | peddle ' em out to the feed-lots in Illinois . That 's where we 're goin ' . It 's new country , and I 've bought up a preemption on some land , and we wo n't need to own niggers to work it . I 've got some machinery in mind to work on that we can make something out of all by itself ; something big , maybe , if me and Askwani can work it out the way we used to .... Do people have to knock out at the front gate to git in here ? Somebody was knockin ' at it , it sounded like . They 've gone now , I guess . " " Some peddler , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . It 'll only take a minute , and it might be Askwani . " He objected that Askwani did n't know where the house was , but she reminded him that neither had he till he looked for it , and went out to make sure . Whoever it was had gone ; probably some street-peddler , as she had first guessed . She turned back as Maruca came down the walk on the same errand , with a newspaper held over her head to keep off the rain dripping from the trees . They both put their heads under the sturdy periodical and hurried back to the overhanging caves . They stopped a minute in front of Maruca 's door , and Maruca put her hand on the latch and spoke in an undertone , as if it was all confidential . " I have been getting your dresses and things together , " she said . " The things I made for you when you first came , and some newer ones . Your old dresses you have outgrown , and they wo n't be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little big , but you will grow into them . There are not as many plain dresses as you will need . I would have made more of them plain , if I had known . " " Known what ? " Ruhama said . It struck her , outside of that point , how an incident like her father 's arrival could bring out differences in people : old Perrault 's heart was centered on an ideal of human happiness , which was generous , but he had thought only of the effect that her departure would have on him . Maruca 's love was for a dead roan who  | had loved her , which was selfish , but she had her mind entirely on the way in which the departure would affect Ruhama . " What is it you should have known about ? " Maruca studied her sharply . " Has n't your father ? But then , why should he ? He has n't had time to tell you everything , and this is something you would find out about for yourself in any case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and do n't talk loud . " She opened the door , and held it as Ruhama went into her room . A small Indian baby lay asleep in the middle of her bed : broad-faced , black-haired , placid-looking and unperturbed by its surroundings as Indian babies always were . It moved a little as the light from the door fell on it , and then settled back and slept again . " It 's his ? " Ruhama said . Her voice was louder than she intended . This was what old Perrault had done so much backing and filling about when she asked him if her father was alone . She was glad he had n't told her ; the longer such news was put off , the better . Death itself could n't have stunned her more . Maruca put a warning finger to her lips and nodded . " It is what he has brought you from his travels , " she said . She was n't being in the least ironical ; she seemed actually pleased . " Look at its hair ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sedaya left him ; your sister . She is a girl . " " Half-sister , " Ruhama corrected stiffly . She looked at the baby again , and turned to the door . " He did n't tell me . It 's ? I 'd better go back where he is , I expect . He 's waiting , and there 's nobody with him . " " You are n't angry , are you ? " Maruca said . " Look , how well-behaved it is , and how clean he has kept it ! " " Maybe he did n't do that , " Ruhama said . She was not angry with the baby , particularly . Her grudge was against Maruca for trying to get round her by wheedling . " Maybe  | he got that old Choctaw squaw to do it , after she was through peddling her cigars and red peppers . " Maruca had lifted a fold of the baby 's dress to show its spotlessness . She laid it carefully back into place , frowning . " Cigars and red peppers ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with on the salt-boat . But that could n't be so , and you must n't think such things , it is wrong for you to think that about your father . Besides , this is not the baby the old Indian woman was keeping . It is n't the same at all . " " What 's any different about it ? " Ruhama demanded . " It 's exactly the same , as far as I can see . How do you know it is n't the same one ? Even if it was and you knew it , you 'd say it was n't . You 'd say anything that you thought might keep me from finding out the straight of it , would n't you ? You 're afraid I might not want to go with my father if there was that against him . You want me to go , you want to be rid of me , no matter what the straight of it is . Do n't you ? " The baby stirred a little , and Maruca motioned Ruhama outside and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been through a great deal , " she said . " More than he has told you , I imagine ; maybe more than he realizes . Your help may be what is needed to save him . It is not too late for him to be saved , to make up for what he has lost and wasted . For us here , it is ; we are too old , we have lost too much . We do n't want you to go , but you will count for more with him than you could with us . You have made our days pleasanter , but they all leave us where they found us , no better and no worse : only older . Your father is still young . What happens to him now can help or hurt him for all the rest of his life , and it can help or hurt you . It would hurt you both for you to feel bitter against him , or angry , or distrustful . You must n't do it . " " I 've got a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I saw that old squaw on the salt-boat with a baby that was the image of this one . Do you know for sure that  | it 's not the same one ? Or do you want me to think it is n't on account of my father ? " Maruca opened the door , glanced in , and eased it shut again . " It is not on account of your father , no , " she said . " You must not speak of this to your father . He should n't know that you have had such thoughts of him . A father is entitled to respect from his daughter in thoughts the same as in words , and I have told you the truth . This is not the baby the old Indian woman had on the salt-boat . I swear it , and may God rot out my tongue and remember all my sins against me if I have lied . Now promise not to tell your father of this . I must get your clothes ready for the boat . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Warne needing help more than she and old Perrault did . She had probably perjured herself in swearing the baby was not the same , but likely enough that she had n't done it on Warne 's account . It was merely her zeal for meddling in other people 's relationships , even at the risk of landing herself in difficulties with the Throne of Grace ; and she did have a soft spot for the baby . With Ruhama 's help , it would receive better care than Warne could give it by himself . That seemed all there was to her concern , but , since it was something she had been willing to commit perjury for , Ruhama swallowed her doubts and stuck to her own promise faithfully . She put the waterfront encounter out of her mind , and avoided mentioning the salt-boat except to ask her father casually whether he had been down to look at it since it had been built over . He did n't show much interest in the subject , and said merely that he had n't noticed it , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't appear uneasy or anxious to shift the conversation to something lighter , she put the whole matter aside without making up her mind on it one way or the other . She was n't aware that even a suspended judgment in such a case could influence her in things that were completely un-  | related to it . That came out when they got down to the steamboat-dock to go aboard the up-river boat in the evening . Askwani was camped on some coffee-sacks near the head of the gangplank when they made their way toward it . He got up and looked at Ruhama lugging the baby asleep in its clothes-basket . He did n't say anything . He looked sulky and countrified ; his hair had grown long , and his clothes had got small for him and were faded at the seams and wrinkled from having been slept in . When Warne went to arrange for the tickets , he shifted his gaze to the baby and nodded forebodingly . " This is what he 's done for us , " he said . " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what he ought to let alone , oh , no ! I-le knowed what he was doin ' , and everybody else could politely stand to one side and tend to their own business . Now he 's got us saddled with this . All Indian , every blamed speck of it , plumb to the gizzard . You 'll throw away your time tryin ' to raise a youngun lake that . She 'll raise herself . It would n't make a lick of difference whether you slung her out on a mud-bank and left her , or set over her and squalled Sunday-school lessons in her ear for the next twenty years . She 'd come out the same Indian either way , and I 'll bet you on it . Well , he got what he went after , I guess , for all the use it 'll ever be to him . " It was his way of sympathizing with her , and it helped . She was almost as cold and dispirited as he was . Maruca had piled an armload of roses on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place against the waterfront sights and the river that she felt half a mind to throw them away . " He might have some use for her , though , before we 're through , " she said bitterly . " You can always draw a pack of draggletailed women around you if you 've got a baby to show off to ' em . He would n't mind that , I guess . " Askwani looked at her sharply , and glanced at Warne dickering about fares with the purser . " He 's still at it , is he ?  | Well , there 's one thing about it . We 've got him this far without any of ' em , and from now on we can keep tab on him . If you think he 's up to anything , you come and tell me . He got away from us once , and that 's all of it we can afford . This time we 'll know better what to look out for . " Warne signaled to them , and they followed him aboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the gangplank that led to the forward-hold where the belowdeck passengers were quartered , Ruhama made up her mind about Maraca 's roses . She threw them out into the river , and turned away as they disappeared into the black water . They were from the last kept flower-garden she was ever to set eyes on .  | C H A P T E R N I N E STEAMBOAT TRAVEL UP the MISSISSIPPI RIVER VARIED IN picturesqueness and interest according to the level the traveling was done on . The Ingomar , like all passenger-boats , was divided into three decks , one above the other . The topmost was the hurricane-deck , on which was the pilot-house . For the pilots , who occupied it , the journey was an endless shift of strains , risks , perils , tribulations and triumphs , all many times experienced and described , with suitable embellishments . Below the hurricane-deck was the saloon-deck , containing the dining-room , ladies ' lounge , officers ' quarters , bar , and the small kennels called cabins where the first-class passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis cost around twenty-five dollars , including meals and cabin , and the commonest complaint about it was its dullness . Below that was the boiler-deck . Some two-thirds of it , running from a little forward of the paddle-wheels to the stern , was taken up by the engines , fuel , cargo , and cook 's galley . The space forward of that , from the paddle-wheels to the bow , was all one big room , with three tiers of wooden bunks built around the walls and a huge cookstove occupying the center . It was for the deck-passengers , for whom the same thousandmile passage that cost the higher-toned saloon-passengers twenty-five dollars apiece cost around five dollars , and sometimes less . The wooden bunks were included in the deal at no extra charge , but the deck-passengers had to prepare their own  | food , the stove being provided to cook it on . It was a dubious boon , because those of the deck-passengers who were n't flatboaters heading back north from their summer 's navigating were German immigrants on their way inland to Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a huge wooden chest along with their clothes and spent most of their waking hours cooking and eating smelled up the whole room , large though it was . The bunks were of rough planking , without padding of any kind . The passengers slept in them without undressing , bundling their valuables inside a coat or a bandanna and using it for a pillow , which combined a certain degree of security with a certain order of comfort , for anybody who was not overfinicky . Warne had brought some quilts to spread on the planking , but they were no help against bad air and smells . Ruhama took hers out on the foredeck , wrapped herself in it , and sat down among piles of rope and odds and ends of cargo to stand out the night . From Natchez to Vicksburg was nine hours . It was chilly , and in places drizzling rain , but the ventilation was any amount better than it had been inside , and there were lights to watch and speculate about . Sometimes there would be merely a running-lantern on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosts , or a big broadhorn lumbering downstream with cotton for the bobbins of England and country-money for the faro-banks of New Orleans . Sometimes it would be another steamboat , and somebody in the pilot-house would call down that it was the Mud Hen , or the Rienzi , or the J. P. Scroggins , never hesitating for the name and never having his word doubted , even when the boat was so far away that its lights were only a grayish gleam across the black waters . Sometimes the light would be steadyburning and reddish , which meant that it was a log-fire announcing wood for sale . When the boat drove past without turning in , the fire would wink and go out , and the Negro who had got up in the drizzle to light it would roll back into  | his blankets to sleep till the sound of another boat rousted him out again . Sometimes there would be a light swinging from side to side in the darkness like a pendulum , and then the boat would let off a jarring bellow from its whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheezing anxiously as it inched its way through the shoals and snags in the blackness . A burning pitch-log swinging back and forth meant that there were cabin-passengers waiting to come aboard , and cabin-fares to be collected from them for the accommodation . Sometimes it was only some mud-flat farm working late at its hog-killing ; once it was a patch of scrubpine timber burning ; several times it was n't anything at all . Finally , none of it was anything . Ruhama went to sleep . She woke when the boat reached Vicksburg , and went back inside to warm herself by the stove while the Germans were out replenishing their supplies of food and the flatboaters were wandering out among the saloons and catchpenny-rigs along the waterfront . She slept again in the warmth , and saw nothing of the country beyond Vicksburg till the boat put in at the Walnut Hills to take on wood . The difference in the kinds of deckpassage it was possible to arrange for showed up when the mate came into the fore-hold to roust out wood-carriers . Warne had paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant that they were permitted to stay where they were and take things easy while the wood was being loaded on . The Germans and most of the flatboaters had paid from three dollars to three dollars and a half , with the stipulation that they were to help carry wood aboard whenever it was needed . The mate inspected all the tickets , and herded the cut-rate passengers ashore in the drizzle to start at it . The firewood was six-foot lengths of split logs , wet , heavy and cumbersome . Two sticks at a load was all a man could have managed even with solid ground under him . lic wood-piles were at the top of a mud-bank with a steep  | slope of twelve or fifteen feet , so slippery with the rain that it took both hands to climb it . The emergency-gangplank beyond was a couple of two-by-six joists laid side by side , springy to walk on and so beslimed with mud and beslicked with rain that merely staying on them was a feat equivalent to a slack-wire act in a circus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine , so the wood-carriers took their task as they found it , and risked their necks lugging fuel for the steamboat-engines , two sticks at a trip , till they had loaded fifteen cords of it . Nobody slipped and broke a leg ; nobody fell off the gangplank into the river , though several came close . The money they saved on their passages by woodcarrying they mostly spent on restoratives at the bar on the upper deck ; all except the Germans , who spent theirs on butter . Beyond the Walnut Hills there was nothing except swamps and bayous till the boat crossed over to the Arkansas side of the river . Then the country lifted into little knolls and swells of grassland between clumps of oak timber . In places there were herds of wild hogs rooting for acorns among the dead leaves . Once some wild horses racketed out of the canebrake and galloped across the skyline , with dead twigs and gray streamers of Spanish moss tangled in their manes and forelocks . Once an old man came out from shore in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivershallows with a small cannon mounted in the bow of his craft , and peddled to steamboats for their dining-room trade . He sometimes killed as many as a hundred ducks at one shot , and believed implicitly in the wholesome and healing bounties of nature as against the selfishness and artificiality of civilization , as well he might . A couple of hours ' run beyond that , when the boat was tied up unloading some crates of machinery at one of the plantations , a young fireman from the engine-room came out on the foredeck where Ruhama was , and attempted various  | half-clumsy and half-bullying advances , so that she had to go back inside to get away from him . She was still inside when the boat put in again to take on a dozen or fifteen head of grass-cattle : stary-eyed brutes , which fought insanely against being led on board , and flung half the Negro deck-hands into the river before they were all finally loaded . The family that owned them got on after them , and came into the deckpassengers ' cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hulking , the other compact and middle-aged ; there were two women , probably in their late twenties , bold and waspish-looking ; there was a loutish-featured girl of fourteen or fifteen , and a boy of ten or eleven with a man 's hat pulled down over his ears and a chew of tobacco in his cheek . They were not out of the ordinary for that country , but when the middle-aged man frowned , said something to one of the women , and lifted his head with a kind of slantwise jerk , Ruhama took her eyes off them hastily and sat back behind the stove , her heart so tight-drawn that she could scarcely breathe . The slantwise jerk of the head was something she had seen before : the Cargills all did that . She had almost forgotten what the Cargills had looked like , but the gesture brought that and everything about them back to her memory . The middle-aged man looked like a Cargill ; he carried himself like one ; she would have sworn that he was one . There were even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said the Cargills were running cattle up the river from the Chickasaw Nation . Warne was in one of the upper bunks asleep . She dared not wake him , for fear some of the Cargills might recognize him . Even if they did n't , she would have to explain what was up , and they would hear it ; or , if she got him outside to explain , that would make them suspicious . She even hesitated about going outside herself , for fear the baby might come awake during her absence and draw their attention to Warne . The baby did come awake while she sat trying to decide on  | something , but it merely lay with its eyes open , staring with polite detachment at the reflections of light the waves outside made on the ceiling as the boat walked through them : silent , incurious , non-committal . Askwani had been right about it : it was Indian all the way through . For the moment , Ruhama was glad of it . She got up , with one last look at Warne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and up to the hurricane-deck , which the below-deck passengers were permitted to use for exercise and fresh air when the weather was bearable . She found Askwani sitting back of the smokestacks for shelter from the wind , rolling a set of feather-and-anchor dice on the brim of his hat and humming a Choctaw song to himself . There were two lines to the song , which he repeated over and over : something about how great kings were dead , make ready to dig their graves , which the Choctaw medicine-men sang as a part of their standard treatment for cases of rheumatism . He stopped it when he saw her , and swept the dice up in his hand , looking a little foolish at being caught in such childishness . She told him hurriedly about the people who had come aboard with the cattle . She did n't mention that they were Cargills , merely that Warne was in danger from them as long as they remained anywhere near him . The danger was from their women . Anybody could see from their looks that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and drew any of the obvious conclusions about them , trouble was sure to come of it , first from them and afterward from their men . " Even if he tries to let them alone , they 'll lead him on , or something , and that 'll be every bit as bad , " she wound up . " The men will blame him for anything that happens , and if he hurts any of them it 'll be as bad as for them to hurt him . We 've got to get him away from here before they go to work on him . Maybe we could get off at the next town and wait for another boat . " " There ai n't any towns close enough , " Askwani said . " A  | few landings , and a wood-yard or two , that 's all . If we got off at any of them , we 'd have to lay out all night , and the ground 's wet and it 's liable to rain . We 'd better stay where we are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket in on a cabinpassage for himself . He 'd have to pay extra for it , but it would git him away from ' em . " She did n't like the notion . The baby would be a complication , and she could n't feel easy in her mind about having the Cargills separated from him by only a short flight of stairs . It was bad enough to know that they were even in the same country with him . She said merely changing decks would n't be enough , it would have to be something surer than that , and leaving the boat was the surest and best . Even if the women had n't turned up to lay temptation in his path , there were other risks and embarrassments that she wanted to get away from . For one , there was the headstrong young fireman from the engine-room who had annoyed her on the foredeck till she had to go inside . Askwani asked if she had told her father about him , and she said it was the last thing she would think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything like that . He 'd get into a fight , and somebody would get hurt , and there 'd be trouble about that . We 'd end up worse off than we are now . I do n't want you to say anything to him about it ; not now , anyway , not till we 're landed and away from here . I do n't want you to do anything about it yourself , either , if that 's what you 've got in your mind . " 11 He promised to say nothing and do nothing , and rattled the dice in his hand reflectively . " This fireman of yours sounds like a kind of a lively customer , " he said . " What does he look like if be give you time to notice ? " She denied any proprietorship over the fireman , and described him as near as she could remember : short , heavyset , black hair drooped down over his forehead , a hickoryshirt with a triangular flap torn loose in the back , dark-gray trousers held up by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for him , I guess , " Askwani said , as if the minuter details were beneath his notice . " Them women look like they meant business , do they ? How many are there ? Is the outfit signed on to help carry wood ? " " The men are , " she said . " They were arguing about it when I left . There 's two women and a girl . The girl 's bigger than I am , a whole lot . Mean-looking , too . They all look as if they 'd suck eggs , as far as that goes . " He clacked the dice together one last time , and got up . " If we had your father here to help with this , we 'd find the right way to fix it , " he said . " Well , we 'll have to do the best we can without him . I heard ' em say up in the pilot-house that we 'd pull into a wood-yard about sundown . They want to load on wood while it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better stay up here till that 's over with . There wo n't anybody come botherin ' you up here , and it 'll only be for an hour or so . After that , you can go wherever you please : back to the foredeck , if you 're a mind to . " " You 're not going to get into a fight with anybody , are you ? " she said . " You promised you would n't . " " I do n't aim to harm a solitary soul of ' em , " he said . " I do n't want to waste that much of my time on ' em , if there 's any way around it . I do n't know whether I can work the whole thing out by myself or not , but it wo n't hurt anything to try . You stay up here till we pull clear of the wood-yard . You can move over against the smokestack if it gits cold for you . " IT GOT COLD , BUT SHE STAYED WHERE SHE WAS , WATCHING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray in the fading light : a canebrake , with patches of water gleaming from among the dark stalks like armor reflecting light behind spears ; a cypress swamp , with a fat Negress in a violently pink mother-hubbard dress lolling against a stump , fishing in it , though it was merely an oversized mud-puddle , too thick to  | swim in and too thin to paint with ; an island , buried in yellowing cottonwoods laced together by gigantic vines ; a woodcutter 's clearing , the gray gleam of the cabin-roof lighting a scattering of deadened trees that towered over it , rocking dangerously at every breath of wind , a few lank cows poking despondently through the mud , a dozen or so gaunt children with pallid and old-looking faces : the woodcutter and his wife 's reiterated pledges of love to each other mildewing in a lightless slough to the color of fungus on a stump . Marital love ; the fireside ; the family circle . The woodcutter 's clearing dropped back into the tangle of wilderness ; the wilderness itself dropped from sight behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-yard came into sight , and the steamboat turned in for it with a bone-racking bray of its whistle from over Ruhama 's head . She sat waiting , looking back toward the clearing in the dark timber , making up a romance about it to take her thoughts from what Askwani might be doing down in the deck-passenger cabin while the men were out loading wood . The romance had to do , naturally , with the people who had made the clearing and built the cabin , and with what could have possessed them to pick such a place to drag out their days together in .... Roscoe and Sophronia were young lovers back in some farming-country in Georgia or North Carolina . The land was too crowded and unproductive to make marriage possible for them , but they loved each other so mortally that life apart was unthinkable . At first they discussed dying together , but afterward they decided to be more sensible about it , so they sneaked out over the backfence in the dark of the moon , and made their way , tired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a flatboat as far as the first steamboat-landing . Then they traveled on the steamboat miles and miles , Roscoe carrying wood at all the wood-yards while Sophronia watched admiringly from the foredeck , both scanning the shore eagerly for some place where the country was  | not overloaded with people so they could have it all to themselves and be with each other . Finally they found a hole in a swamp so remote and godforsaken that even the buzzards had given up watching it , so they waded ashore , hand in hand , and deadened a patch of trees and built a pole-cabin and settled down in peace together , untroubled by the press and strain of humanity , to stock up the place with as many new specimens of humanity as they could produce in the shortest possible time .... Well , Roscoe , this here one makes eight we 've got , or maybe it 's nine , and I do n't know what in the nation we 'll feed all of ' em on . Well , Sophronia , me neither , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of something . Well , Roscoe , I reckon we might as well , there ai n't no use just dawdling around like this , when The wood-loading was almost finished . A couple of deckhands stood by the gangplank , watching the engine-room for the signal to haul it in , and a third deck-hand climbed the mud-bank to cast off the mooring-rope . He tugged at it absently , sighted at the foredeck for a clear space to throw it aboard , and stood for a second staring with his mouth open . Then he dropped the rope , slid down the bank , and jumped to the foredeck , yelling some half-inarticulate warning that cut off with a wrenching grunt as he lit . The two deck-hands at the gangplank ran for the place he had jumped from , and jumped after him . A woman screeched something , and kept screeching it against a clatter of men 's voices that rose higher and angrier till they drowned her out . Doors slammed , the boat jolted and rocked , there was a sound of men hurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruhama set up a paralyzingly unexpected jangling that kept up till its buzzing in her head sickened her . It stopped , the pilothouse door opened . and a man called , " They got him ! " and voices down on the saloon-deck took that up and repeated it back and forth so it sounded like an echo rattling from side to side in a bottomless cave . Got him , got him ; they had got  | him . While she sat frittering away her time inventing motives and causes for a family of mud-hole squatters , Roscoe and Sophronia and their assorted get , it had happened . It was over . The pilot-house door shut again , and the boat blasted a spout of steam against the darkening water and turned one paddle-wheel experimentally , as if testing its muscle . Askwani came up the stairway , shaded his eyes for a minute in the halflight , and came over and sat down . She could tell by the set of his jaw-muscles that he was wrought up , but he held himself in . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " lie said . " Maybe you 'd better . It 's late for you to be up here like this . It 's all over . " She sat without moving . " I heard them say they 'd got somebody . Is my father  --  did anything happen to him ? " Not that I know of , " he said . " Nothing that shows on him , anyway . The man they got was from the outfit that owns the cattle down in the hold : the oldish one . He got into an argument with one of the boiler-tenders while everybody was out on the wood-Pile The boiler-tender talked back or something . So the old man hauled out a knife and stabbed him . Three or four times , it looked like . He did n't do it for any joke , either , by the looks of that knife of his . It had a blade close to a foot long , and a bunch of wing-feathers set in the handle to hold it point on when he throwed it . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cargills , back home across the mountains . " " I thought the older man looked like the Cargills , " Ruhama said cautiously . " The Cargills did n't all look alike , though . What was the argument about ? " " What you 'd expect , " Askwani said . " One of the women : the slatty one with the long chin . She 'd gone out on the foredeck where that loose cargo was piled . Somebody 'd cut a hole in one of the coffee-sacks , and she wanted to catch the coffee that leaked out , so it would n't go to waste . That was how  | she told it , anyway . She thought the old man was out on the wood-pile , but it turned out he was n't . He 'd hid out from that to keep tab on her . So when this young boiler-tender started payin ' attention to her , he watched ' em for a minute or two , and then he pulled his apple-peeler and walked in on ' em . There was n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed it off . It was all over before anybody else knew it had started . " " I know , " she said . It was beginning to be clear , both what he was telling and what he was dodging around telling . There had been no hole in any of the coffee-sacks when she was on the foredeck among them . The middle-aged Cargill would n't have hidden out from wood-carrying merely on the strength of his own suspicions ; it would have been simpler , if he thought his wife needed watching , not to sign on to carry wood to begin with . It needed only one thing more to fill it all in . " This boiler-tender that got stabbed : was he short and heavy-set , with a hickory-shirt and black hair and a ? " " It was the one you told me about , yes , " Askwani said , as if such coincidences were too ordinary to deserve dwelling on . " It was the one you said bothered you on the foredeck till you had to go inside . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess . The way it looks , he 'd always mosey up there and bother somebody whenever he did n't have anything else to do . " It was as she had thought . She had been prepared for it , exactly as he told it , but his air of detached virtuousness in telling it was a little too much . It was bad enough to do such things , without pretending innocence of them and contempt for their victims afterward . " He went up to the foredeck because you put him up to go there , " she said . " He bothered that Cargill woman because you put him up to that . She went there because you cut one of the coffee-sacks open to tempt her . That husband of hers hid out and watched her because you told him to . You got the whole thing up  | yourself , all of it . It 's nothing to be proud of . You got one man stabbed and another one hauled up for trying to kill him , and you 've turned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her when he gets loose , if he ever does . All because you did n't want us to get off this boat and wait for another one . Would n't it have done less harm if we had ? " He was not in the least abashed . " I did n't cut any coffeesack open , " he said . " All I done was push it a little , and it tore on a nail . I did n't tell the woman to go up to the foredeck . I did n't tell any of ' em to do anything . I talked a little about what they 'd find if they did go there , and they went all by themselves and found it . If we 'd got off of this boat , we 'd have had to stay out all night in the wet . Maybe longer . There ai n't many up-river boats this late in the year . We might have got pneumonia , and that would n't have been better than what 's happened . I did n't do anything except what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fireman , and you 're rid of him , for all the rest of this trip and a long time afterwards . You wanted to git us away from that cattle outfit , and we 'll be plumb shut of ' em in another ten minutes . They ai n't goin ' to hold the old man for this . They 're goin ' to put the whole pack of ' em ashore and leave ' em . If you 'd had it your way , it would have been us . Would that have been better , with a baby to take care of ? " " I do n't know , " she said . He was right : it was what she had wanted , and he had merely arranged for things to work themselves out to that end . The trouble was not in the results he had achieved ; it was in the deliberate ruthlessness with which he had used other people 's frailties to bring about their destruction . Young Savacol 's quarrelsomeness had been childish and showy and useless , but she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had some kind of feeling behind it , and it was something she could watch . Askwani 's operations were underhanded , indirect , dispassionate , frightening in their  | efficiency and disregard of casualties . Her uneasiness made him a little apologetic . " I told you we ought to have your father help with this , " he said . She did n't answer , and he got up . " I worked it out the best way I could think of . We got them women away from him , that 's one thing . Look , they 're puttin ' the whole outfit ashore . I was right about that , anyway . There they go , the whole bunch of ' em . " She got up and followed him over to the deck-rail to watch . The Negro deck-hands were taking the Cargill cattle up the springy gangplank at a run to keep them from balking on it . One Negro handled the lead-rope , another grabbed the cow 's tail and gave it a double-twist as she got to the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blazing pine-pitch , and clapped their hands together like pistol-shots . The Cargills watched the disembarkation from the bank , with varying displays of emotion . The younger of the two men herded the cattle up the mud-bank as they came ashore , paying no attention to anything else . The half-grown girl bawled loudly and tonelessly , holding her mouth wide open so that it was possible to see a moist mass of half-chewed bread in it . The older of the two women scolded her in an undertone for carrying on so , and continued to scold even when she let up doing it . The long-chinned woman yelled vituperations at the man who had done the stabbing , holding her mouth a couple of inches from his ear , and he stood and scowled at the steamboat without paying any attention to her . The eleven-year-old boy yelled his vituperations at the steamboat , screeching louder and louder as the paddles began to move and the deck-hands cast loose the mooring - rope and jumped aboard . As it moved away , he gave up yelling , spat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as hard as he could . Then the paddle-wheels took hold , the boat put its head upstream , and the darkness closed down ahead of it and behind it and shut the wood-yard from sight .  | " We might as well go on down , " Askwani said . " It was on your father 's account that I done it . You know that , do n't you ? ? " I suppose so , " Ruhama said . She was thinking of the eleven-year-old boy 's face at the last , and the tears spattering around him as he threw the chew of tobacco . " IIe acted like he was cussing at somebody on the boat , did n't he ? He threw that tobacco like he was aiming it to hit somebody . " " Maybe he was , " Askwani said . " Maybe he aimed it to hit me . " " He did n't look up at us at all , " Ruhama said . " It was somebody down on the boiler-deck , it looked like . " " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I suppose so , " Ruhama said . Her father was down on the boiler-deck , and he had probably been watching the Cargills being put ashore . He could hardly have stayed asleep through all the hubbub they had made . The boat caught in a swift place and dropped back for a second toward the woodyard , and she shivered . " We 'd better go on down now . Let 's hurry . " THERE WAS NOTHING MUCH AFTER TIIAT . THE BOAT PASSED two or three mud-bank landings where signs were nailed up announcing railroads under construction , for which five thousand men were wanted immediately , but nothing to indicate what they were wanted for , or where . In one place , about dark , the boat passed a flatboat-load of Negroes being taken down the river to work somewhere in the black lands . The Negroes were singing as the steamboat drove past them , one of their religious songs called Wall ; in the Water . Knowing they were being taken down into country they knew nothing about , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song a psalmlike dignity  | Walk in the water , children , Walk in the water , children , Walk in the water , children . God gon na trouble the waters ! When they stopped , the Negro deck-hands on the steamboat struck up a song of their own in response . The deckhands were not slaves , and they were not being carried anywhere that they did n't want to go . Their song had no dignity at all . Gaining their freedom , they had shed that off ; it came only with martyrdom , exile , despair . They were willing to spare it , probably , but the difference showed . When you go to Sweet Ellum , keep yo ' money in yo ' pants , ' Cause the women in Sweet Ellum never gives a man a chance . Open the windows , open the windows wide , Open ' em up and let that Sweet Ellum smell outside ... . The boat passed a town that had been cleaned out by cholera : all the houses standing empty , the windows broken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roofs , and no sign of life anywhere except haggard cats stalking restlessly about the dead streets and sunning themselves on broken roofs and crumbling window-ledges . It passed a big three-story building standing out , over the river where Negroes were kept for sale , and they stood at all the windows looking out blankly like mules at a mule-auction , though not quite like them , either . It passed out of the country where the swells of upland were still green , and into gray stands of trees and brown grassland , streaked in places with grayish halfmelted snow . At Cairo , it tied up , and Warne and Ruhama  | and Askwani and the baby changed over to a railroad-train which took them through a long stretch of black swamp filled with naked flood-killed trees , and into a great swell of level grassland in which endless coveys of prairie-chickens flushed up from the track a few yards ahead of the engine , or sat quietly on the right-of-way fence and watched it go bouncing and rattling past . At a station named Carbondale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Askwani tended to the baggage . It was on the open prairie , though there were patches of corn and wheat in sight all around it . As a town , it did n't amount to much ; there were four saloons , a store , a church , four shanty-built dwellings , and a livery-barn at which Warne got a team and wagon . They loaded themselves and the baggage into it , and followed a set of hub-deep wheel-ruts full of black mud out across the skyline into the open grassland where Warne had bought the pre-emption rights on the land where he was to make his new beginning .  | C H A P T E R T E N NOVEMBER ' WAS A POOR TIME OF YEAR FOR FIRST IMPRESSIONS that far north , and Warne 's pre-emption land-claim on the Southern Illinois prairie offered little to be impressed by beyond grayness and dampness and neglect . It had been used as a road-contractor 's work-camp back in the days before the flush times evaporated away , and the buildings remaining from that vagrant incarnation remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded them against being stripped for firewood and fencing . They consisted of a small unpainted wooden house with boarded-up windows , its siding splashed and streaked where rain had beaten against it , a pole-barn and some open sheds containing rusty road-machinery and a small portable forge , and a stone storehouse littered with partly-shelled corncobs and empty crocks and hung with strings of dried apples , peaches and pumpkin , as well as various bunches of fearsome-smelling herbs intended for use as medicine . The ground between the sheds and the house was matted with fallen leaves , brown and yellow and crimson , which sank a foot into the mud underneath when walked on , afterward filling with icy black water . Below the house there was a small cornfield and gardenpatch , enclosed by a sagging rail-fence and occupied by two scrub milk-cows and one overgrown calf , big enough to have been weaned months earlier , which imbibed its aliment from both of them with unflagging diligence and complete impartiality . Below the cornfield there was a thicket of trees bor-  | dering a little creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all black-limbed and angular and naked , which clattered metallically when the wind blew as if they retained no recollection of ever having been alive , though they had merely shed their leaves for winter . Beyond them was the road back to Carbondale , and , farther out among the cattle-trails through the brown prairie-grass , other roads leading from other farms to the same meek but dogged outpost of civilization . It was the roads across the prairie , and the state they fell into when the rains set in , that had led Warne to see an opening in the country for somebody 's inventiveness . The land between the farms was all open range , used only by some of the big cattle-companies to run their herds on from early spring till the grass withered in the fall . The roads had not been worked on except for one brief splurge back in the early days , and they merely followed and deepened the wagontracks by which some first settler had wandered across the country looking for some place to light . On the higher flats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a work-team would wear out at pulling an ordinary two-ton wagon through it , and wagon-tracks in it would grow over and disappear completely in a week . Since the Illinois Central land-grant of alternate sections bordering its right of way through the country , various new designs in sod-breaking plows had been developed for the heavy-grassed prairie-land , but , since nobody had invented draft-animals with strength enough to move them , they were not much used . Where the ground was low , the sod was shallower and more yielding , but it was too dank and watersoaked to grow anything on , or even drive a furrow through without having it fill up with water . The places where a road crossed such ground were called slews . They were sumps of bottomless mud , bordered by patches of coarse swamp-grass and standing puddles , varying from a few hundred yards to a quarter-mile long . A re-  | quired article of equipment for any wagon with back-country traveling to do was a couple of stout fence-rails , to pry on the hind-wheels with when the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warne 's idea about the place , which had struck him on his way south at the start of the fall rains , was to collect the abandoned road-machinery from where it had been left standing , and patch it together into a horsepower machine to dig drainage-ditches on the low prairie-ground , wherever the topography made drainage possible . It could be used not only to draw off the water from the clews and improve the roadbed through them , but also to lighten the adjoining ground so that at least parts of it could be turned to cultivation . He had not figured out very clearly who was to pay him for it . The county road-commission seemed a possibility , since it would be a public improvement , and the railroad company seemed an even better one , since it was advertising its landgrant holdings as the agricultural bonanza of the age , needing only the touch of a plow to fulfill its destiny as the granary of the nation . There were still other likely prospects , but he did n't bother his head about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . The work of putting together a contraption that would actually dig drainage-ditches troubled him scarcely at all . He had seen ore-hoisting rigs back in the Georgia gold-mines , and the principle was so near what he had worked out in his mind that he regarded his project as merely a job of adaptation rather than invention . After he had spent two months overhauling an old four-wheeled scraper and rigging a chain of ore-buckets along one side , it became clear that copying the ore-hoist brought him only to the beginning of his problem . His plan took in varieties of work that no ore-machinery had ever been intended to handle ; ore-hoists did n't move , and he needed a rig that would operate while in motion ; they were designed for loose earth and broken gravel , and he needed  | something to break and lift sod , interlaced roots , and mud so tough and rubbery that at some seasons it would pull the hoofs off a horse . There were other differences . For three or four days after they began to dawn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . Then he roused up , forced himself to eat , and tramped out to the ramshackle little blacksmith-shop to start all over again , with Askwani pumping the bellows for him and offering suggestions that he first rejected and then took up and argued over and improved on . During that period , neither of them rested . Even after they had knocked off for the day , they would keep on arguing about what they had done or what needed doing . Sometimes , in the coldest nights of the winter , Ruhama would hear them start arguing in bed over something new : the thing needed something to cut through the roots and sod ahead of the wheel-buckets , something like a circular saw , maybe ; no , that would take too much power to operate , it would break if it hit a pebble , what was needed was something simpler , something that would cut with weight on it , a wheel with a cutting-edge : a disk , maybe . Yes , that might do it , it might work , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting up and clattering with the lantern and clumping out to the shop , still arguing , and sometimes , when she woke with the cackling and clatter of the prairie-chickens that flocked to the trees below the house on frosty mornings , she would see their lantern still burning and hear them still debating back and forth : well , but if you temper it down like that , it 'll be too brittle ; yes , but it 's got to have a tempered edge or it wo n't cut ; yes , but maybe we could rig up some way to temper the edge and leave the center the way it is , here , start the forge and let 's see if we can ? We 'll have to go easy on the coal , there ai n't much left , and we 've got to keep enough for the house . Coal was the standard fuel of the country . It cost a dollar and a quarter a ton at the railroad , but hauling it out took  | two days , going and coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul more than a ton at a load . Between keeping the house warm and running the forge , they used up that much in ten days during the winter . The ditching-machine needed parts that had to be made at a county-seat foundry eighty miles away , and hauling them out took from three to four days , even when the weather was lenient , which it seldom was . When they had hauling to do , it rained , and the bottom dropped out of the roads ; when they got the machine to a point where it could be tried out , a cold spell struck and the ground froze as hard as iron ; when they brought it outside for more room , it snowed , thawed , froze , and snowed again , and they had to spend two days digging snow and chipping off ice before they could even move it . With spring there came thaws and floods , and when the new grass sprouted and the ground warmed so they could start a back-yard garden , there were visitations of wire-worms and army-worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnats and mosquitoes to swarm over Warne and the work-team in smothering millions when he took the ditchingmachine out to see how it worked . It was hard to hold the horses on a straight course with the insects bedeviling them , but he ran a three-foot ditch around the low ground below the garden in two days , with the earth laid out in a neatly-sloped ridge alongside it , and had the standing puddles drained and new grass sprouting where they had been in less than a week . AfterNvard , with a few repairs and improvements , he cross-ditched a couple of the slews on the road to town , and cleared the mud-holes so effectively that a couple of German settlers closer to town hired him to ditch twenty acres of their waste bottom-land for a corn-field , paying him off with half-a-dozen young scrubsteers that had been getting themselves mired in it and having to be pulled out . Then a couple of small farmers down on the railroad gave him five head of grown cattle to run a ditch  | around their corrals and orchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers for fencing gave him eight mixed cows and yearlings to cross-ditch forty acres on which to increase their output , which , since set-hedges of Osageorange were the only stock-proof fencing obtainable in country where fence-rails were so scarce , was in wide demand . There were other calls for his ditching-contraption during the early weeks of spring . All except a few small road-repairing jobs were paid for in cattle , money being scarce . By the beginning of warm weather , he had accumulated close to forty head of mixed steers , cows and yearlings , and had ditchingcontracts waiting for him from several counties to the east when the malaria paused in its regular course through the country to fasten on him and lay him out . All the old history-books abound in accounts of the perils and hardships that early settlers in the western lands had to endure in their struggle against wild beasts and savage Indians . None of the chroniclers allows more than passing mention to the danger and suffering people had to endure , both then and later , from the new land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through both kinds of affliction would hesitate to affirm that , of the two , the chills-and-fever was by long odds the meaner to stand . One reason the histories passed over it so lightly may have been that it was considered a problem for medical science , which had to work slowly and carefully at accumulating and studying facts before reaching any final conclusions , and had to labor against the handicap of local superstitions and irresponsible assumptions . There were various writers for backcountry newspapers who , without any collection of observed facts to back them up , persisted in arguing that , because malaria never occurred except in the mosquito-season and in places where mosquitoes were , the mosquitoes must be to blame for it . The task of suppressing such fantasies was a serious impediment to research into the subject , though the  | doctors patiently pointed out that it had no more basis than the old belief about flights of passenger-pigeons being responsible for the great yellow-fever outbreak in Philadelphia , or about Halley 's Comet having spread virus-pneumonia through the Lower Mississippi Valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , that malaria was caused by the evaporation of stagnant water , and that the only way of preventing it was to move where water did not become stagnant , in which they were backed up by many well-attested case-histories . The settlers in the prairie country could n't afford to move merely on the strength of case-histories , so they stuck it out where they were , and the malaria swept in and ran itself out among them regularly every spring . There were three species of it : Warne 's , which was the most prevalent , was called " regular chills . " It struck with scrupulous regularity every other day , beginning with a two-hour attack of piercing cold , passing into another two hours of searing heat and devouring thirst , and ending in a drenching perspiration that left its victim limp , trembling , flaccid , and as depressing to everybody around him as he was to himself . There was not much that could be done for it : home-remedies like red-willow root and feverfew and water-lily stalks sometimes helped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept on occurring strictly on schedule . The doctors prescribed Peruvian bark , which did help if the patient took enough of it , but it was almost as hard to endure as the malaria itself , and the effect only lasted a few weeks , after which the malaria came back and took hold as heartily as if it had never been away . Warne 's illness was almost as hard a siege for Ruhama as it was for him . It came at a time when she had the spring gardening to attend to in addition to the house , the cooking , the milking , and the baby . Askwani would have helped , but the job of herding their newly-acquired range-cattle out on the prairie-grass every morning , counting them in again at  | night , and hunting out strays and hideouts from the herd left him no time for anything else . The neighbors helped as much as they could , after the news got around among them , and one of the old settlers named Cartwright contributed a couple of his grown daughters for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorously that he had more of them at home than there was room for anyway , and that there were one or two business-deals he might bring up later on , in case Warne managed to survive their ministrations . The daughters were brisk and businesslike young women in their late twenties ; they were not much for looks , and they quarreled with each other eternally , but they were more useful around the house than old Cartwright had made them out to be . The work lightened and began to show finish from the first day they took hold and started squabbling over it . Piles of clothes got washed and put away , the kitchen was scrubbed and cleared of stray utensils , the whole house was put in order so it was possible to find things in it , and Warne began to gain strength and fret about getting back to his work while there was still some of it left . He took it out in mere self-accusing restlessness when there was nobody but the women around . When Askwani came in from the cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been tryin ' to figure how much this sick spell stands to lose me , " he said . " There 's the Doughty brothers over past Locust Grove that want some ground ditched for a feed-lot . I 'd git six or eight head of cows from them . There 's old Rile Lucas that 's got a townsite surveyed out down on the railroad , and he wants the streets ditched . That would be another dozen head ; more , maybe , if he wants cross-ditches . And there 's that colony of Germans back on the flat that wants sixty acres ditched to put hemp and wheat on , and they 've got fifteen or twenty young steers I 'd git for that . There 's right at sixty head of cattle I could drive in here and  | own , if I could git out and do half a man 's work . All I 'm fit for is to set here and have things packed to me . " " You 'd better stay here awhile longer , anyway , " Askwani said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if they do n't , you 're better off without ' em anyway . You 've got all the cattle our pasture-strip will carry through till winter right now , if we save out enough of it for hay to winter ' em on . Bring any sixty more in , and you 'll have ' em strayin ' out into the prairie faster than we can head ' em back . If any of them Duncans catch ' em out on the open grass , you 'd as well not have ' em at all . " The Duncans were the big cattle-company that held the open grassland around Warne 's land . As was the custom with all the large operators , they allowed every settler a quartermile strip of open grass all the way around his land , on which to pasture his farm-stock . The grass outside that limit was held , used and treated as theirs , and any settler 's cattle that strayed onto it got prodded up and chased out of the country , passing from one outfit 's range to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding up in the purlieus of Wisconsin , or some similar misfortune . " I do n't aim to keep any cattle over till winter , " Warne said . " These or any new ones either . We wo n't need our pasture-strip that long , and we wo n't need to put up hay except for the team and the milk-cows . I aim to turn all of our cattle off onto the market by summer . I 'd be at it now , if it was n't for this . " " You can do it easy enough , right where you are , " Askwani said . " The Duncans will buy ' em . They 'll buy ' em from you right now , or they 'll herd and pasture ' em for you till fall and buy ' em after they 're fattened up . Either way , you 'll have ' em off your hands . Then you can handle as many new ones as you want to . " " The Duncans would want a sales-agreement on ' em , " Warne said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . They could fork out whatever price they felt like , and I 'd have  | to sell for it whether I liked it or not . I can git a better price on these cattle than they 'd give me . I know as much about sellin ' cattle as they do , and maybe more . They 'll find that out before I 'm through around here . " " We did n't come out here to start any cattle-business , " Askwani said . " We had it laid out to rig up a machine that would ditch bottom-land . We done it , and we ought to keep on with it . What if you do know more about cattle than the Duncans , that do n't hinder you from workin ' at something new , does it ? As far as that goes , you wo n't even git a bid on these cattle here if you try to handle ' em by yourself . The buyers around here wo n't waste time on anything under a hundred and fifty head . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you know how to go at ' em , " Warne said . " I 'll have that many , and maybe more . We may not have ' em here , but there 's other farms around that have got small herds , the same as we have , and I can git some of ' em to bunch and sell with us . " Askwani sat back and glanced in the direction of the kitchen , where the two Misses Cartwright were washing dishes and carrying on an energetic dispute over the soap . " So that 's how they 've worked it on you , is it ? " he said softly . " The Duncans wo n't handle any of old Cartwright 's cattle , and there ai n't enough of ' em for the buyers to want , so he 'll put ' em in with yours and git ' em turned off that way . I wondered why he was so blamed open-handed with them daughters of his . Housework ai n't the only thing they 've been busy at , it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , " Warne said sternly . " I 've been too sick to move , and they 've helped us when nobody else would . If you think there 's any more than that to it , you ought to try havin ' the chills-and-fever yourself some time . You 'd see . You 'd do better not to listen to any crossroads scandal about other people , too . If the Duncans know  | that old Cartwright has stole any cattle , why do n't they haul him into court for it ? " " Maybe he 's stopped doin ' it , " Askwani said . " Most people around here have got too much work on their hands to fool away any time haulin ' old Cartwright into court , or anybody else . Anybody can see what he 's been up to , though . You can see it by the mark he uses . Nobody 'd dock his cattle 's ears that close unless there was some other marks he wanted to git rid of . " Cattlemen on the Illinois grassland never marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use among them was the earmark : crop , split , slope , upper and under-bit , vent , swallow-fork , and various blends , permutations and elaborations thereof . Every livestock-owner had one of his own , which was registered with the county clerk in the same way that brands are registered nowadays . Warne 's was a left vent and underbit . Old Cartwright 's was a full-crop . It was drastic , since it amounted to amputating an animal 's ear down to a mere stub , but it did have the advantage of being impossible for anybody else to mark over . It also eliminated marks of earlier ownership , in case there had been any . " Old Cartwright 's mark is his own business , " Warne said . " He was usin ' it before there was any cattle around here except his , and he 's got a right to keep it if he wants to . You ca n't hold a man responsible for what people say about him behind his back . They 're bound to talk about something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as it 's about him , " Askwani said . " If you bunch your cattle with his and do his sellin ' for him , they 'll say the same things about you . It may not hurt , but it wo n't help any , and you could put in your time a whole sight better . You 've got enough work with ditch-contracts to last till frost , and there 'll be more of it . We ought to work out a different cutter-blade for that machine some of these times . It broke twice the last time we had it out . "  | " We can patch it so it 'll do , " Warne said . One of the Cartwright girls came in , bringing a tin-cup full of bitter-herb tea for him . He swigged it down meekly , and closed his eyes and shuddered as it took hold . " We 'll use it all it 'll stand , and we 'll put in as much time on it as we can . I do n't say you ai n't right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sell the cattle wherever it 's handiest . The only thing is that this is one time I ca n't . I did kind of make a promise on it . I had to , the way it was with us then , and I 'll have to keep it . " He handed the tin-cup back to the Cartwright girl , and , as the old song put it , thanked her with his eyes . She smirked approvingly and withdrew , and Askwani got up . " All right , if you promised to bunch your cattle with his to sell , go ahead and do it , " he said . " Do n't do any more than you promised , though . Let him tend to his own sellin ' . You do n't have to stick yourself out in front of a lot of buyers with cattle that everybody knows has been slickeared , do you ? " " I did n't promise anything about that , " Warne said . " If it 'll satisfy you , we 'll let him handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all we 'll need to do . It 'll only be this one time , if that 's the way you feel about it . " " If you 'll do that , all right , " Askwani said . " You stay with what we 've started , and I 'll stay with you . Till the last dog 's hung and the string cut . I 've got to git back to them cattle . " RUHAMA WAS PULLING WEEDS IN THE GARDEN WHEN HE CAME out . She was doing it less because it was needed than to get away from the house for a while , but she kept on at it when he stopped . " I heard some kind of a hair-pulling going on in the kitchen , " she said . " Could n't they settle whose turn it was to carry his snakeweed-tea in to him ? " " It was something one of ' em had done , or had n't done ,  | or something , " he said . " I did n't pay much attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got him , I guess , " Ruhama said , and yanked loose a sprig of milkweed with force enough to have uprooted a small sapling . " They 've worked at it hard enough . They had it all laid out for one of them to land him when they came over here . I knew all along there was something . " " We could n't have got along without somebody to help out , " Askwani said . He did n't sound as concerned as he should have . " You ca n't lay down the law to people about how to act when you need ' em to help you . He 's been too sick to notice ' em much , and maybe it do n't matter anyway . Somebody 's bound to land him , one time or another . We ca n't head ' em all off . " " He ought n't to marry anybody , " Ruhama said . " There 's too much that he may still have to settle with somebody for .. He had a  --  an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for that . You knew he 'd killed a man , did n't you ? " She had intended it to be a shock to him , but he merely glanced at the house and said he had thought there was some such thing . " Somebody in that Cargill settlement , I judged , the way you acted about ' em that night on the steamboat . He 's safe if he stays clear of crowds , though , and it ai n't our business what these women git mixed up in . Let ' em leave his work alone , and they can do anything else they please , for all of me . They had it laid out for him to give up his . ditch-contracts and branch off into cattle , but I stopped that . He 'd already promised ' em to put his cattle in with theirs to sell : the ones he 's earned with the ones their old man has stole . That 's bad enough , but it 's all . There wo n't be any more of it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cattle old Cartwright has stole , though , " she said . It did n't seem as awful as he made . it sound . " They 'd be marked different from his . "  | " There wo n't be any trouble about it now , " he said . " Not the way we fixed it . The only thing is that he was all fixed to sell ' em himself , in front of a crowd where somebody might recognize him , and he was all in the notion to go back to the same old rigmarole we had back in Crow Town , because cattle was something he was used to . This ditch-rig of his is new . Nobody 's ever done anything like it before . He 's got to go on with that , and figure ways to make it better , and figure out some newer rig and work on that . There 's nothing to workin ' back over your own tracks . A man ought n't to do the same blamed thing over and over again all his life just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's learned all there is to know about it , it 's time to quit . " " You would n't have to back-track , though , even if he did , " Ruhama said . " You could figure out something new and work on it yourself . " " He 's the only one that can do things like that , " Askwani said simply . " I 'd like to , but I ca n't . He do n't care anything about it , but he can do it when he has to . " " Cattle would be easier , " she said . " You almost killed yourself working with that machinery this winter , working nights in that shed when it was below zero . " He looked away from her . " You 'll think I 'm a fool , " he said in a low voice . " This winter was the best time I ever had . There ai n't anything that I 'd ? " He left it unfinished , and went to look after the cattle : down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , across the gray picket-fence banked high with last year 's leaves , and into the open pasture beyond : a streaky kind of youngster , stubborn and secretive like an Indian , with contradictions about him such as no Indian could have dreamed of . He could plot the knifing of a fellow-being without a quiver , and work whole nights in an open shed through the dead of winter helping Warne with a mechanical problem without asking or wanting anything for it ; he loved new  | experiments and projects , and had to depend for them on a man who cared nothing about newness and too much about smaller things ; he associated with Indians when left to himself , but had separated from Warne because he objected to Sedaya . . . . Though , after all , if he had suspected trouble between Warne and the Cargills , that might explain his coldbloodedness in arranging to get them put off the steamboat . And , after all , if the Cartwright girls were still keeping up their squabbling , that might be a sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Warne . They might keep each other headed off from him ; something might happen to turn him away from them . Nothing was lost yet . With anybody as changeable as Warne , nothing ever was quite lost . THEY BUNCHED THEIR CATTLE WITH OLD CARTWRIGHT 'S AND started across the prairie with them in the late weeks of spring . There were two wagons : Ruhama drove one , with the baby installed among articles of camp-equipment in the back , like the pickaninnies young Savacol had told of seeing in the emigrant-wagons down the Trinity Bottoms in Texas . The two Cartwright girls drove the other , dressed up till they squeaked , and took turns fretting their team into skittishness and then pretending to be terror-stricken . Warne and Askwani and old Cartwright herded the cattle , keeping them well strung out and moving slowly to graze as they went . Cattle being trailed can lose weight as easily as a thistle sheds its down in a wind ; a day or two of hurrying , or a stampede lasting a little over an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' feeding and pampering to put on . There were patches of purple and yellow flowers out , and in places men were mowing fire-guards around the deep grass to cut for hay when it ripened . Once they saw some Duncan cattle out pasturing , with several young bulls mincing around a clump of small bushes and charging everything in sight .  | Warne rode through them , and found a young heifer back of the bushes having a calf . She was in trouble with it , as sometimes happens in first calvings , and he got down and helped , stationing Askwani to distract the bulls by flapping a blanket whenever they edged too close . The time was about sundown . The cool sunlight touched him as he worked over the heifer , holding his horse by the picket-rope looped over his arm . Back of him there were scatterings of flowers , the swell of new grass , the mild air that held color even where the shadows striped through it . Something about the light made him look younger than Ruhama had ever seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he finished hurriedly , and mounted and rode on , pretending modestly that it had been merely something in the bushes he had wondered about , and that it was not much of anything , after all . The heifer steadied herself , and began licking her calf and nosing it to its feet . She was clearly glad to be rid of him , but Ruhama wished the Cartwright girls had stayed out of it , so she could have watched him at it a little longer . The place they were headed for was Green 's Ferry , on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River , opposite and a little downstream from Cape Girardeau on the Missouri side . There was no town at Green 's Ferry , merely some corrals and a steamboat-landing , but it was a shipping-point , and there were a couple of dozen small cattle-herds camped around the landing waiting for buyers . Some small settlers and shantyboaters were holding a camp-meeting in a grove of cottonwoods downstream , and a point of land a mile or two upstream was where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west in the removals , waiting for the ice in the river to clear so they could cross . The spring freshets had washed out all trace of their camps , but some of their graves were still in sight on the high ground . It had been a cold time of year to camp out , and they had died fast .  | C H A P T E R E L E V E N THE CAMP-MEETING FOLLOWED THE SAME GENERAL PATTERN as most of them . The services were conducted from a low board-platform set up in the middle of the cottonwood grove . There was greenery festooned over it , and plank-benches ranged in front for the congregation to sit on . The worshipers ' camps were scattered all through the grove , some centered around tents or wagon-covers , some around brush lean-tos thatched with boughs , and a good many having merely a cooking-place and a few blankets draped on the adjacent bushes for the sake of other people 's modesty . There was considerable praying from remote fastnesses of the underbrush early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and religious services took up an hour after sunrise and ran along till well into the night , but the tone of the meeting was not all religious . Some of the campers had come merely to look on , and some took a scoffing attitude about the whole business , claiming that the worshipers were trying to make up , by a week of exaggeratedly vociferous piety , for all the rest of the year having been frittered away in dallying with whiskey-glasses and women 's blandishments , as the old rhyme almost put it , and that they would backslide into the same round of worthlessness as soon as the hysteria of the meeting wore off . Some people were there for trading-purposes , and peddled split-oak baskets , leaf-tobacco , patentmedicines , and cotton dress-goods among the camps between sermons , and one very old lady , Grandma Luttrell , had come  | all the way out from Cleary 's Grove with a buckboard full of Indian remedies on which she claimed to be an authority . She drove a brisk trade with the women , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those from small farms in the back-country , who had come mostly for the sake of being in a crowd after too much living to themselves , and the shanty-boat people from the river , who joined in because they were under continuous suspicion of thievery along their line of travel , and employed demonstrations of piety and repentance as a means of clearing their characters . They were the most fervently devout members of the congregation , and the noisiest . They sang the most lustily , wallowed and wrestled with sin the most agonizingly , and mourned and testified so piercingly that it was impossible to imagine them having a thought left for anything so sordid as calf-stealing for months to come , though the cattlemen camped within range of the grove took care to keep their herds under watch at night , and , despite that precaution , lost calves regularly . There were five or six preachers , who relieved each other on the platform every two hours or so during the day . Most were rough-cut and backwoodsy ; those who were not pretended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from somebody who knew less than they did than from anybody who knew more . . . . Now , brethren and sisters , I hai n't come here to preach to you offen any big swad of book-larnin ' . I hai n't any geographarian nor grammatician nor any of them big-bug high-inkey-dinks . The only thing I know about is the Word of the Lord , and I take my text from somewhars around the Book of Hosey , in the chapter whar it says , And ye shall go out at the breeches , every cow at that which is before her , and the horns of the halter shall be cut off and fall to the ground . Now , brethren and sisters , we 're a-gwine to examine what that thar passage means whar it says , And ye shall go out at the breeches . . . . And so on , with singing following : Stand the storm , it wo n't be long ,  | anchor by-and-by ; I see them angels beckon from on that golden shore , and I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Goliath agreed to have a fight , and settle all their quarrels accordin ' , David whopped Goliath on the side of the head , and knocked him on the other side of Jordan , on the other side of Jordan , where the Tree of Life is blooming , there is rest , there is rest for me ! They closed their eyes and laid their heads back on the long notes , making up for long months of oppressive silence in lonely places by blasting the quiet of the cottonwood grove to eternal smithereens . Their singing was not much for music , but it was pleasant to listen to after a whole year of none at all . Warne sat in front of his tent and beat time to it , humming along with the tunes and frowning impatiently when one got away from him . He acted half in the notion of going over and taking a hand in the services along with everybody else , but the singing let up and a new sermon got under way before he could make his mind up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for the people who were doing it ; some of them came nearer dignity in it than they could ever expect to at anything else , but she felt that for Warne to take part in it would merely make him look foolish . There was a middle ground to it somewhere . The two Cartwright girls ridiculed the entire meeting , singing and all , and one of them went out to the cattle-pasture to keep from having to listen to it , which was as foolish as being struck under conviction by it . She came back after the preaching had started again , and reported that old Cartwright was dickering over the cattle with a couple of buyers from Cincinnati , or St. Louis , or somewhere like that . He had told her to go away and not bother around , so it looked like a sale . " They was talkin ' twelve dollars and a half a head , " she said . " He wanted ' em to raise it , but even if he sells for that , it 'll run around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He promised us we could have anything he got over a thou-  | sand dollars , and we could go over to Cape Girardeau and buy anything we pleased with it . Hats and shoes ; stockings ; maybe dresses . Mmmmmm ! " She flushed at having named anything so intimate as stockings . Her sister took it up and went her one better . " A corset , too , " she said unkindly . " You need one bad enough , the Lord knows . All the men around here gawk and wink every time they come past , the way you hang out . You 'd better tend to that first of all , and then buy them other things with whatever 's left over . If there is anything . We do n't know that our part of the cattle will be over a thousand dollars . " " It ought to be , " Warne said . He had let his gaze stray involuntarily to the Cartwright girl 's uncorseted attractions , and he let it linger a little . " It ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled anywhere near right . " " It 'll be whatever old Shanghai Grimes ' outfit is in the notion to pay , I guess , " the tart Cartwright girl said . " Paw 's sold cattle to ' em before . He generally knows what they 'll pay before they start , and they know what he 'll sell for . If they 've offered twelve dollars and a half , that 's what it 'll come out at . " Warne repeated thoughtfully that it ought to run higher than that , and the plump-bosomed Cartwright girl moved and sighed . " Paw ai n't used to sellin ' cattle , " she said . " He 's never had anything but little dabs of ' em to sell . He do n't know about it the way you do . I wish we 'd got you to handle ' em . I wish you could handle ' em all the time , and anything else you wanted to .. . . Well , I do ! " She glared defiantly at her sister , who had let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment 's silence , which Ruhama recognized as presaging a collision between them . She hoped to heaven there would be one , the louder and more vituperative the better . Let them rip at each other , and let him see how they looked at it . It was time ; it was  | more than time . If they would only hurry , if one of them would only blurt out something the other could take her up for ? They both drew breath to start , and Askwani came riding in from the cattle , ducking his head for the tree-branches that caught his bridle-buckle and left torn leaves bunched under the clasp . " I thought we 'd better have the bills of sale on them cattle of yours , " he said . " Them buyers have been actin ' like they thought the whole bunch was stole , and it wo n't hurt to show ' em that ours ai n't . We 're down to a deal with ' em , it looks like . Twelve dollars and a half ai n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's worth something to have ' em off of our hands . " " Twelve dollars and a half ! " Warne said , and got up . The tart Cartwright girl started to laugh , and then looked hastily away and did n't . The plump one opened her mouth and clasped her hands over her bosom , and then unclasped them and pulled her dress up at the neck . Warne turned back to Askwani . " I thought I 'd taught you better than to talk any such price as that for cattle with anybody ! Them buyers must have took you for a couple of born fools ! " " It ai n't as bad as it sounds , " Askwani said . " The herd 's streaky , you know that . Some 's old and some 's light . Some of the cows we got from that German colony belong in the boneyard , and some of old Cartwright 's ai n't much better . The fair way to do it would be to price ' em out one at a time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't handle any cattle that way . None of these buyers will . " " You could have offered to average the herd with ' em , " Warne said . " Any buyer will do that , and make his bid by the pound . Did n't I teach you how to average cattle , or have you forgot ? " " We talked about that , " Askwani said . " They 'd have done it , but we would n't make anything on it . I was afraid to try it for fear we 'd lose . Even if we come out ahead , it would n't amount to enough to fool away our time on . We 'd be better  | off to sell ' em and be done with it , so we can git back to what we 've got laid out to do at home . " " We do n't sell any cattle for less than they ought to bring , " Warne said . He was not stern about it ; he was reassuring , meaning it for the plump Cartwright girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on out there with you . If your buyers want to bid by the pound , we 'll do business with ' em . I 'll show ' em some things about averagin ' cattle that Cincinnati never heard of , or St. Louis either ! " " You 'll fool away another week or ten days dickerin ' around with buyers here , and make about eight dollars out of it , " Askwani said . " We 'd make ten times that if we went on home and got back to work . " " We 'll make a sight more than any eight dollars , " Warne said . " You 've let ' em talk them cattle down to you . I 'll show you how to handle a buyer . Money ai n't all there is to this , even if it is all you think of . I 'll be back in around an hour . " Askwani looked resignedly at Ruhama , and turned his horse back through the trees , scattering leaves as his bridle caught among them . Warne strode after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up . Ruhama went back into the tent , still hurting with disappointment that they had n't got into one of their fights in front of him . The baby was lying on a pile of blankets , trying placidly to catch a bald hornet that was circling overhead a little out of reach . She drove the hornet out gingerly , being afraid of them herself , and noticed that the camp-meeting services had tapered down to a few women gabbling together near the platform . Men were hurrying through the trees and out toward the cattle Pasture , ; she even saw two or three of the preachers hurrying along with them . They all disappeared , and the women stopped talking and left . For a long time there was only silence . It was a little scary , since the main purpose of camp-meetings was to escape from silence . ' When it was almost time for Warne to be back , she heard a clatter  | and scrape of branches from the direction of the pasture , and old Grandma Luttrell came driving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a halt . Nobody had any idea how old Grandma Luttrell was ; she could have been a hundred , by her looks , but she took care of herself , asked help or favor from nobody , and drove her buckboard like a long-line skinner for the Overland Mail . She had driven hard from somewhere . Her horses were sweaty , plastered with quivering skifts of foam , and marked with welts across the back where she had applied the whip . " That girl-baby in the tent there , " she said . " Fetch her out and put her here in the seat by me . You 'll need to have her off your hands for a while . Then spread them blankets out longer : long enough for a man , and hurry up . They 'll be here with him in a couple of minutes . " A few stray urchins from the camp-meeting flitted past through the underbrush , like rabbits scurrying from a grassfire . Ruhama brought the baby out . She was so numb with apprehension that she could hardly hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , and nodded . " It 's your father , " she said . " They 're bringin ' him in . You 're not to be scared when they git here with him . This ai n't any time for that . Spread the blankets out for him . Hc 's hurt , and they 'll need some place to lay him . " She drove away . Ruhama went back into the tent and spread the blankets . She was awkward at it because her hands were cold and shaky . The men who had left the camp-meeting were scattering back into the grove , talking in undertones and kicking at bushes as if somebody might be hiding in them , though most were too small to conceal anything bigger than a rabbit . A couple of cattlemen came into the tent , shouldering her aside , and rumpled and reassembled the blankets and built dead leaves up at one end for a pillow . A close knot of men shuffled in as they were finishing , and set down their burden on the blankets : a litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bore twigs and green leaves between the scars and gashed places in the bark . They bunched the leaf-pillow under Warne 's head and stood back , leaving Askwani alone beside him . One of the campmeeting preachers motioned to Ruhama and drew her to the side opposite . He was a heavy-featured man with a big mouth , and she remembered that his preaching had been done in a bawling rattle that could be heard halfway up to the ferry . It made the whole thing seem unnatural that his voice was not bawling at all , but low and gentle . " Stand here and wait , child , " he said . " You must n't be scared , and you must n't try to touch him . We had to leave the  --  the weapon where it was , and you must n't disturb it . Try not to cry . He 'll be so he can talk in a minute , and you must listen to what he says . " She saw that the weapon he meant was one of the Cargill knives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right side , looking at first glance as if it had almost missed him , it was so far out from his breastbone . But nothing was visible of the blade ; there was only a short wooden haft , set all round with a ring of wing-feathers to hold it point on when it was thrown . She thought how he had killed eagles at Crow Town because the Indians ' religion forbade them to , and of the hundreds of dead Cherokees buried in the high ground a little above the ferry , and of Maruca 's saying once that where people believed in a thing , it happened . It was an effort of her mind to escape the truth , but it took her face to face with the truth . Nobody had told her how badly her father was hurt , but the feathers in the haft of the knife were eagle-feathers . She knew from them that he was dying . THE CATTLE-AVERAGING IN WHICH WARNE HAD BEEN STRUCK down was a branch of the trade even then falling into disuse , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mated by early-day eastern dealers , who were accustomed to buying cattle by weight instead of by head-count , and was intended for use in backwoods shipping-centers where there were no stock-scales big enough to handle anywhere near a a whole herd of cattle at a time . To meet that contingency , it was the custom for buyer and seller to settle on a fair price per pound for the cattle under negotiation , and then settle on one animal from the herd as representing an average weight for all the others . The selected animal was then weighed up , and its weight was calculated as the weight per head for all the cattle in the herd , which was paid for on that basis . To eliminate arguments and hard feelings , a strict procedure had been worked out for picking the animal on whose weight the herd was averaged . The buyer and seller stationed themselves on the top rail of the corral-fence where the herd was , and took turns pointing out cattle for the handlers to remove , the buyer working to weed out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until only one animal remained . On it , the herd-average was figured . It was all an elaborate process , requiring skill , patience , quickness of eye , concentration , and a knowledge of cattle that would have made an encyclopedia on the subject sound like mere infantile babbling . Old Cartwright 's buyer , who was known as Shanghai Grimes from some fancied resemblance to the roosters of that species , was good-naturedly paternal when Warne suggested their trying it . He had no objection , he said , being an old hand at it himself , except that it would be a waste of everybody 's time . The most he could offer for the cattle by the pound would be two and a quarter cents , straight through . His offer of twelve dollars and a half by head-count would come to more than that , he thought ; it might run close to two cents and a half , the shape the cattle were in . Old Cartwright advised Warne to take the twelve dollars and a half and be thankful for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger he met cherish a secret  | hankering to skin him . Trying to improve on a transaction that was reasonable enough already would leave them no better off , and might come out worse . " I 'll average the herd at two cents and a quarter with him , " Warne said . " If it comes out less than he 's offered by the head , I 'll make up the difference to you myself . It wo n't , though . It 'll come out more . If it do n't , I 'll sell him my part of these cattle for a cent and a half a pound . " " All right , if you 're that sure I 'm trying to swindle you , we 'll see , " Shanghai Grimes said , firing up a little . " Get down there in the corral , a couple of you men , and run ' em out as we call ' em . Now , young man , we 'll see how much you know about this business . You pick first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Askwani and a corral-hand cutting out the cattle as they were called . . . . The roan heifer with the split ear . The blaze-faced steer yonder by the fence . The spotted two-yearold over in the corner . That bluetick cow with her head down . The buckskin cow with the straw between her horns . The brindled steer yonder with his tail up . . . . It was draggy and wearing , but there was a certain monotonous fascination about it . Men from the ferry stopped to watch , and men came wandering out from the grove to see what they were looking at , and lingered to look themselves . More came as it went on . . . . The slope-eared cow over to your right . The red one right back of her . That polled steer sidled against the fence . The one over this way ; no , not that one , the ? Oh , hell , what difference does it make , run out the one that 's closest ! .. . There was one left : a rough-coated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others were being prodded out into the open . Askwani shoved him into the middle of the corral and stood clear so they could look at him . Warne looked at Shanghai Grimes . " There 's a set of wagon-scales up at the ferry , " he said .  | " I 'll git a horse and take him up for you to weigh if you want me to . Maybe you 'd sooner do it yourself . " Grimes flapped his hand impatiently , and climbed down from the fence . " Turn him out with the rest of ' em , " he said . " I can call his weight without any of your blamed wagon-scales . That brute will run a little better than seven hundred and fifty pounds ; not much over that , maybe , he 's light in the hind-quarters . That would come to ? " " He 'll do a pound or two better than seven hundred and fifty , " Warne said . " At two and a quarter cents , that 's right at seventeen dollars . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to figure the whole thing out . " " We 'll call it seventeen dollars straight through , " Shanghai Grimes said pensively . " It 's been a hell of a long time since I had anything like this worked on me . I 'll bet you ca n't do it again . " Warne had started to climb down from the fence . He paused , standing astride the top rail , and looked out at the Cartwright girls . " I might not be able to do as well at it , " he said . " I can fetch it out to beat the first offer you made , but we said this would be the time that counted . " " This is the one we 'll count , " Grimes said . " Let 's try it again just to see what happens . I 'll bet you a hundred dollars you ca n't bring it out to seven hundred pounds on me . Here 's all this crowd bunched around , we might as well give ' em something to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and we 'll start over . You ca n't make a hundred dollars any easier . Stay where you are . " He put his foot on the bottom rail to climb up . The onlookers gave back as old Cartwright opened the corral-gate , leaving an open space in front of Warne . A man stepped out into it and called Warne 's name . Nobody noticed much about him ; Askwani was helping to turn the cattle back toward the corral , and did n't even see him . Warne looked down  | and nodded sociably , and the man tilted his head back and fumbled one hand inside his shirt . " A little something I 've brought you from back home , " he said . " I 've been packin ' around to give to you for a long time . This is the first chance I 've ? " He drew back his hand and threw the knife . It was so quick and unexpected that even the men who were closest did n't see it till it had hit . Warne looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red blot on his shirt , and let go his hold on the fence and slid off head-first into the dust . All the men crowded around him to see what had happened , and whether there was anything they could do . None of them took time to notice what became of the man who had thrown the knife . For all anybody knew , he might merely have stayed among them to watch . They would have drawn the knife out in spite of Warne 's efforts to prevent them , but Grandma Luttrell came driving past from the ferry and forced her buckboard in among them so that they gave back while she got down and inspected the slant and depth of the wound . From her experience with such things , she ordered them to leave it as it was , and directed them in cutting poles and ripping wagon-canvas for a litter to carry him back to camp on . She prescribed none of her medicines for him . Some of the men asked her about that , but she merely shook her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it gently . Then she climbed back in her buckboard and drove on ahead to warn Ruhama and relieve her of the baby till it was over . When the men had carried him in and fixed the blankets for him to lie on , they cleared away the pack of onlookers from in front of the tent , including Shanghai Grimes , who stormed around swearing at everybody for letting the knif ethrower get away , and offering rewards for anybody who would catch him . Half-a-dozen of the men remained in the tent , in case they were needed for anything . Ruhama and Askwani  | stood on opposite sides of the pallet where Warne lay . There was nothing for them to do but wait . It seemed hours before he opened his eyes . For a long time , nobody thought he ever would open them again . Finally he moved , looked down at the tuft of eagle-feathers against his right arm , and looked up at them . " You 're both here , " he said . " And these men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't much time left , I guess ? " He turned his eyes past them to the men . The heavy-faced preacher wriggled his neck around inside his collar , and answered for them . " Little enough , " he said . " Maybe half-an-hour . That 's the most you 'd better figure on . " " I can stand it that long , I guess , " Warne said . " I want you men to listen to me first . Here 's these children . They 're under age , and they 'll be alone . They ca n't go back home , because they 'd be alone there , and they 'd have to be bound out . They 'll have to go west to their folks , to their mother 's folks . I wo n't have ' em bound out . I want you men to give me your words that you wo n't let anybody bind ' em out while they 're still here . I want you to promise that nobody 'll hinder ' em when they 're ready to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wagon 's too heavy for children to handle . " Binding out was a form of servitude which the laws of the time imposed on children left orphaned . It was popular in non-slaveholding regions as a means of recruiting domestic help without having to pay for it . Bound children could be worked harder than slaves commonly were , and since they cost little to keep and nothing to acquire , they were always in high demand , especially in farm areas . The preacher wriggled his neck again , and answered for the rest of them . " We 'll see that they 're let alone , " he said . " We 'll see that they 're fixed with whatever they need to travel , and that they ai n't hindered when they 're ready to leave . I 'll tend to it myself . You 've got my word for it , and if I have to hurt anybody  | to make my word good , I 'll do it . We all will . Try to finish with worldly business . We 'll tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's other things you ought to put your mind on . " " I 'll do the best I can , " Warne said . He turned his gaze to Ruhama and Askwani . " We wo n't waste time on what you already know . These men will find you some kind of a cart in place of the wagon . You 'll load our camp into it , and sell off anything you do n't need . You 'll ferry across the river here and head west . You 've got to go live in the Territory . Your mother 's folks will look out for you , and the tribe 's got an orphan-fund if you need it . There 's a road west where you 'll be let alone and there 's no malaria . Pay attention , so you can keep on it . When you 're ferried across here , you 'll go to Walker Station . Then turn west to Macon City , and cross the Missouri at Lexington . Keep on up the river to Weston . You 'll cross back there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . When you cross that , take the wagon-track south till you strike a main freight-road . You 'll turn west on that , and keep to it . How much of that do you think you can remember ? " They were both scared . Ruhama could not have repeated his directions if it had been a chance to save him . She could think of the towns and crossings he had named off only as representing seconds of his life he was dealing out to them from the few he had left . All she could hear was his voice , all she could see was the strained pallor of his face . Askwani managed better . He looked at Warne with his face blank and set , and said he remembered all of it . " We ferry across here and take the road west to ' Walker Station , " he repeated . His voice was a high strained monotone . " West to Macon City . Cross the Missouri River at Lexington . Keep along the river to Weston . Cross back , and south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and south to the big freight-road , and turn west on it . I 'll remember . "  | " The big freight-road west , " Warne said . He shut his eyes to call back more places and landmarks . The men whispered among themselves , and one of them put in that he was giving himself trouble there was no need for . If he would tell them which road the children should travel , they could work out the directions , and leave his mind clear for his own parting preparations . He told them no . " I 'd sooner make sure , " he said . " I 've traveled it and you ai n't , and this boy will remember it better if he hears it from me . How far was I ? " " South from the Kansas River to the big freight-road , and turn west , " Askwani said . " Keep on the freight-road straight west , " Warne said . " There 's a freighters ' camp about where it crosses the Wakarusa River . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freighters . A farmhouse might try to stop you . There 's water along the road as far out as Hundred and Ten Mile Creek . It 's got a big stand of trees around it , and wild plums . From then on , water the horses whenever you can . You 'll strike Switzler 's Creek next . There 's a spring that comes out of the limestone at the right of the road , and a log house . Nobody lives in it . Past that , you 'll be in the open prairie . See how much of that you remember . " Askwani recited it back in the same strained monotone , as if it had been a response to a litany . From then on it became one , Warne 's voice stumbling out road-marks as he forced his mind back over them , Askwani droning them back as if they were laid on him to memorize as a punishment . " .. . Hundred and Ten Mile Creek , a big stand of trees and wild plums . From then on water the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spring that comes out of the limestone , and a log house without anybody in it .

There 's gooseberries , and a spring runs out of a rock at the west edge of the brush . Next is the Council Grove . The spring there comes out of a big oak-tree root to the right of the road .

Fifteen miles on to Cottonwood , and leave the freight-road there . I heed you . " " Bear down on my hand , " Warne said . " Hunt downstream from the freight-camp at Cottonwood Grove .

Ford in the tracks , and head straight east . You 'll cross a dry bench , and  | then there 's a pond with a rockslide above it . The pondwater 's bad , but there 's a box-spring in the rockslide , with some short bushes around it . Keep on east and cross the Verdigris on a long gravel-bar with tracks down it , and keep on to Walnut Creek . It 's shallow , and there 's light timber along it .

You ca n't lose it , and the Creeks is peaceable . They 'll help you or leave you alone , whichever you need . " He was through the hardest part . He lay back fingering the tuft of feathers with his free hand while Askwani said it over . Then he hurried to finish . " The Creeks will direct you if you 'll tell ' em where you want to go . You do n't have to be afraid of ' em . Tell ' em you want the Cherokee Agency . You 'd better go there first . They 'll work out where you all belong when you git there . Do n't try to go anywhere till they tell you to . There 's fightin ' around the upper country most times , and you might run into some of it . Have you got that all in your head ? Let me hear you say it all over . " Askwani shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's that land-claim and the ditch-machine , " he said . " Ai n't we to do anything about them ? " " You ca n't , " Warne said . " There 's payments to make on the land , and you could n't run ditches or patch machinery by yourself . You 'd git bound out somewhere to work for nothing if you tried it ; all three of you . Leave things the way they are . You 've been all the help a man could want . I do n't know what I 'll do without you . . . . Ruhama ? " She moved between him and the light so he could see her . He was losing strength fast . He could hardly move his lips to form words .  | " You deserved better than any of this , " he said . " A man never knows . There 's Elison that I lost you , too . You 'll have to find her yourself . It 's as well I did n't . You can tell her how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her . I 'm not . " His voice dropped away . She knelt down by him . There was nothing that she wanted particularly to say , nothing that needed saying , but she wanted to speak to him . It seemed a way of holding him that much longer . " We 'll find her , " she said . " We 'll tell her about you . I wish we did n't have to tell her anything , I wish we 'd never come here . I wish we could have stayed in Crow Town in the mountains , I ? " " She 'll come back , " he said , so low she could barely make it out . " See to it that she do n't find you in any place you 're ashamed of . Remember all I 've told you . All that about the roads , and do it . I wish ? " His eyelids relaxed , and his hands dropped slack . She cried out " Do n't ! " and the heavy-faced preacher caught her and drew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay still . There was the same look of absorbed serenity about him that she had seen in his face when he was down in the prairie-grass helping the young heifer with her calf . One of the men covered him with a blanket and drew Askwani away . " There it is , I guess , " he said , after a moment 's silence . " He held himself up to more than I could have done , I know that . You think you 'll remember all them roadmarks he told you , son ? " Askwani said he would remember them , and went outside . It was not to cry ; in a minute or two , he came back with a saucer of salt and set it on the blanket over Warne 's breast . It was something the Crow Town Indians were accustomed to do for their dead , none of them had ever known exactly why . The preacher drew Ruhama outside , and led her over to the camp where Grandma Luttrell was keeping the baby . Coming out of Warne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few yards from the door , staring in at the men around him , her fingers spread out flat against her mouth as if to hold it still . The plump Cartwright sister was nowhere in sight , but Ruhama could hear somebody crying in old Cartwright 's tent as she passed , and the ironic thought struck her that her father would have been pleased if he could have known how they were taking it . Then she thought how it must look for other people to be weeping for him when she was not , and shame over her own lack of feeling started her crying . She cried all the way to Grandma Luttrell 's tent , and kept it up long after Grandma Luttrell had got her to lie down and was trying to quiet her by talking about things that had happened a long time back , things that showed how much farther back time reached than most people thought . GRANDMA LUTTRELL 'S PEOPLE HAD SETTLED IN MIDDLE TENnessee during her early girlhood . It was when the country was still wild , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jumped by some wandering Shawnee Indians , who killed her parents and carried her away to help their squaws with the work around camp : cooking , mending , dressing skins , running bullets , cutting firewood . She remembered cutting wood in the winter when she was still small , while eight or ten fullgrown Shawnee bucks sat shivering in the snow waiting for her to lug it in to the fire so they could get warm . They wandered north of the Ohio after capturing her , and carried her around on all their raiding and hunting till she was about fourteen or a little past . Then they went into camp for the winter at Detroit , where the English had an army-post to protect them against raids and retaliations from the settlers , and hired her out to do sewing for a French-Canadian tailor who made uniforms for the officers . There was an alliance between England and the Indian  | tribes then , under which each was obliged to respect the other 's rights to prisoners and trophies of war , so her standing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave . She preferred working for the tailor to helping around camp , and the Indians made no objection to her doing it , since they collected and spent the wages she earned by it . They had the military authorities ' guarantee against her running away , but toward the end of the winter she ran away in spite of them , with the tailor 's help . He hid her around among various French-Canadian families till the search for her let up , and then smuggled her in among a schooner-load of American civilians being taken down the lake for exchange . They all reshipped at Niagara , and , after more sailing , were put ashore at a landing on Lake Champlain on the frontier of New York State . Some English army-wagons were to carry them on through the American lines , but the officer in charge had an attack of punctiliousness at the last minute , and wanted them to sign an agreement not to engage in hostile acts against any British force or authority after they were turned loose . The others were willing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer that if America was at war with his country , so was she , and that if he would step out into the brush with her for a couple of minutes she would engage in a hostile act by licking the everlasting hide off of him . He was smallish and struttYand though she was only fourteen she was strapping for her age , so he declined . When the other prisoners began hooting and jeering at him , he got mad , told them to walk wherever they were going and be damned , and pulled out with the wagons and left them . It was not a pleasant place to be left afoot in . The country around the landing was wild and desolate , with two feet of snow on the ground , and the prisoners ' sense of humor cooled fast when it became clear that they actually would have to walk out . They blamed the whole thing on Grandma Luttrell , and talked so recklessly about hanging her for it that she  | struck out south by herself . She was overtaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak only Dutch , but cured herself with some of her Indian medicines , and resumed walking . She walked across New York and Pennsylvania and into Upper Virginia , and then got a ride with an emigrant-train back into Tennessee again . So , after five years of walking that took her halfway around the United States , she came back to the settlement from which the Indians had taken her , but after a few months in it she got restive and dissatisfied , and had to move . She moved into Kentucky , where she married and had children , and then into Indiana , and then to Michigan for a few years . Finally she went to live with a couple of her married daughters at Cleary 's Grove , but could n't get along with them . They objected to her sneaking out to the corrals to ride half-broken horses when nobody was looking , arguing that a woman of almost seventy was too far along for such things , so she picked up and took to the road with her Indian medicines , to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted in the few pleasures a woman of her age still had left . She had been wandering the roads for a good many years , and she had found that it kept her from being troubled by her old restlessness . She still had spells of restlessness , but they no longer troubled her . Keeping on the move , there was always a chance of something happening ; there was always a possibility left that something else still might happen to her . It was a slim chance , but no slimmer than when she had stood in the snow among the rickety and run-down prisoners and told the English officer where to head in at . It had not seemed that anything could happen then , in such a place and among such people ; and nevertheless it had . " But all it amounted to was that you had to walk miles through the snow , and then you got the pneumonia , " Ruhama said . " I got to tell ' em all something they needed to know , "  | Grandma Luttrell said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell ' cm that America was a country , and that I belonged to it and was n't afeard to fight for it . There was plenty in them times that did n't think it was one , or ever would be . I told ' em . If I could do anything like that once more in my life , I 'd be satisfied . You could have everything that 's come after it , and welcome . " " You had children after it , " Ruhama said . " Anybody can have children , " Grandma Luttrell said . " They 're all well enough for a while , but then they grow up and git like everybody else . I would n't want to have ' em again . There 's some things you do want again . I stood up for this country when there was n't anybody else in a hundred miles that had the courage to . That 's one of ' em . It 's the only one , or mighty near it . Do you think you can git to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again than anything else ? " Ruhama said . " Anything else I know about , " Grandma Luttrell said firmly . " I do n't know everything . Shut your eyes , now , and you 'll be asleep before you know it . " . . . SLEEP , YES ; BUT BEFORE SHE SLEPT THERE WERE OTHER things that drifted through her head and kept her from thinking whether she was going to sleep or not : Grandma Luttrell wandering the new country at past eighty , selling underhanded doses of soapatle and such correctives to campmeeting women who wanted to rid themselves of out-ofseason pregnancies , living on the memory of something long done and over with , an act of devotion , of sacrifice , for a country that the men were all saying might not last out the growing split over the slavery question . And Askwani , who had loved working with new mechanical contrivances , would be no different , now that the only man who could think them up and set them working was dead . It was a punishment  | for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love that people were punished for hardest : the Crow Town people for loving their land too much to do anything but cling to it ; Sedaya for loving her people more than they were worth ; old Perrault for having loved humanity when it showed no appreciation of the favor ; Maruca , for loving a dead man too much and too long and in spite of her own fear of him . And the people back in the woodcutter 's shack down the river , Roscoe and Sophronia , merely for loving each other ; and her father only for loving women too readily : not many , but always at the wrong time and in the wrong place . . . . There should be a place somewhere in which people could love without being shamed or frightened or exterminated for it . There must be such a place ; it must be ahead , somewhere beyond the river , beyond the settlements , beyond sleep . . . . EWEN WARNE WAS BURIED BETWEEN A COUPLE OF THE OLD Cherokee graves on the high ground above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services over him , and the people sang a couple of their hymns and then went back to their camps . Nobody disturbed the youngsters with any of the practical arrangements about their journey , but when the meeting was beginning to break up and it was time to start on their road , they found that their heavy work-team had been replaced by a single wellbroken cart-horse , and the broad-beamed farm-wagon by a light four-wheeled spring-cart with the back hooped over and covered , and their tent and camp-equipment and a foodsupply already installed in it , along with their smaller belongings . It did not strike anybody , and they did n't notice themselves until they were far out on their road , that the cart had no brakes . No vehicle of that type ever had brakes ; on so light a rig , it was not supposed that they would ever be needed .  | C H A P T E R T W E L V E BEARING NORTHWESTERLY ACROSS THE OZARK PLATEAU IN Missouri , Ruhama and Askwani traveled easily and in something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little creek-bottoms between them where the cart-horse could slack the traces while he rested and drank . Ruhama drove the cart . The baby rode in the back , sitting on some quilts piled against a tool-chest that contained their cattle-money and some things of her father 's . Askwani rode ahead on his herd-pony , though in places where the grade was too long for the cart to manage all at one pull , he would climb down and wait till it caught up , and block one of the hind-wheels to hold it from rolling back downhill while the cart-horse recovered his strength . The farms were small , and spaced out from four to five miles apart . They raised mostly corn , with a few hogs and scrub-cattle to fill in , and since it was their corn-planting season , there was little travel along the road . The clean water in the gravelly creeks was a welcome change from the lowlands , where people dipped from the river and merely thumped the bucket with the dipper to scare the tadpoles into diving for the mud at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were merely clearings in the brush , with a few rods of rail-fence , a two-room log-cabin without any windows , and sometimes a half-grown bear chained to the chopping block in the yard for the dogs to practice fighting on when outside hunting was slack . The men wore hunting-shirts and  | fur caps , even in warm weather , and the women immured their attractions in mother-hubbard dresses and deep-shaft sunbonnets , which was as well . They wore shoes home-made from dry cowhide dressed down with a jack-plane , except the children , who went barefooted . The little girls wore sunbonnets and straight-up-and-down dresses that were always eight or ten inches too short . They wore no underclothes . The boys wore a garment called a tow-shirt , which was something like an old-fashioned nightshirt , though of coarser material . They also wore no underclothes , and did not attain to the majesty of pantaloons till they were of an age to get married . Crossing the far edge of the plateau , water was less plentiful , and it got impossible to camp beside the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was left unguarded , without bothering to find out whether it was good for them or not . They would tip over a kettle of dishwater boiling on the fire , and gulp down the contents blazing hot while being cudgeled within an inch of their lives and screeching with agony because of their scalded gullets . To escape them , Ruhama and Askwani took to putting up at farms for the night . Most were hospitable with what they had , though most did n't have much . The safe rule in picking one was to count the dogs around it first . A place that abounded in dogs was sure to be down to boiled turnips and belly-bacon , if that . A farm where there was only one dog , or none , usually had more to set out , but was likely to be stingy and grudging . From three to half-a-dozen dogs was the most promising , especially if they looked well-fed . Beyond the plateau , the youngsters struck country where the farms were bigger and more prosperous , with horses and sleek cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stopped belonged to a deaf old bachelor , who hauled them straight into his parlor without giving them time to explain anything , and announced that he had made up his mind , from watching them up the road , to adopt them and  | supervise their education and upbringing . He believed in acting on impulse . It was one of his peculiarities , though not the only one . Another was that he kept his coffin up in the attic with his jug of whiskey stored in it ready for use . It helped to remind him that man was but mortal , he said , and since the Negroes were afraid of such symbols , it kept them from tapping the jug when his back was turned . He spent most of the night talking about his plans for the three children , and pulled out for town the next morning to see about adoptionpapers . As soon as he was out of sight , they hurried out and put their horse back into the cart and left . The Negroes pretended not to notice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that his plans for adoption wasted away when he got out of range of his jug . Another place where they were entreated to stay on belonged to an elderly widow , with a couple of grown daughters , also widowed . It was prosperous and thriving , with several thousand acres of deep bottom-land and over a hundred Negroes . The widow managed it all , without any help except from her daughters . None of them could read or write . She kept her accounts with an almanac and some colored pencils , using blue for money received , red for accounts outstanding , and the pictured phases of the moon to keep her straight on dates . Learning to read would have been less strain on her in the long run , but she stayed with her system because it had cost her a lot of trouble to work out , and she hated to see it go to waste . She and her daughters spent three days trying to argue the youngsters into giving up their trip , sometimes taking turns and sometimes working together at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea where the Indian Territory was or how long the journey to it would be . They had some notion of the country as far as twenty miles away from them , and knew the names of the neighboring creeks , but not where they came from or ran to . When they saw that persuasions were useless , they loaded the youngsters ' cart  | down with provisions , and cried as it pulled away , to think of such children venturing out alone into such unknown wilds . Ruhama felt like crying herself to think of them staying where they were and making red and blue pencil-marks on an almanac all the rest of their lives without ever knowing or caring about anything beyond their own line-fences , and imagining they liked it because they had nothing else to compare it with . The farms of western Missouri reached well out toward the edge of civilization then , as was attested by the saying of the wagon-freighters : that west of Jefferson City there was no railroad , west of the Kaw River there was no law , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of settlement , the land ran into patches of half-cleared ground that had been taken up and abandoned ; cabins with only half a roof on , or none ; partly-fenced fields , with piles of fence-rails split and left unused ; scarecrows guarding corn-patches that stood wide open to wandering livestock ; fields with a few furrows scratched around the edges and the rest run to weeds ; young orchards untended , well-sweeps fallen , bee-hives tipped over and the bees gone . It was the year of an Oregon emigration : one of the big ones , the people from earlier trains having sent word back that it was safe and feasible . Beyond the settled farm-country all the roads were crowded with trains of emigrant-wagons of the pattern called steamboat-wagons because each had a stovepipe stuck up through the canvas top like a smokestack . They were all heading for the assemblinggrounds on the Kansas border , moving at a walk , and spaced out along the road so there was barely room between them to clear each other 's dust . There was not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that was something . The Oregon country was bigger then than it got to be later on , and its population was still sparse and thinly scattered . It seemed hardly possible for so vast an addition to be made to it without having  | the event settled in people 's memories for all time to come , but the truth was that none of the residents ever appeared to have any clear recollection of its having happened at all . Most of the people in it dropped out of sight when it was over . A few came into notice for things they would hardly have dreamed of at the start . One man of over seventy had fought against the British at New Orleans , the Creeks at Talladega , the Seminoles in Florida , the Spaniards in Texas , and the Mormons in Missouri , and was going with the westward tide for the sake of spending his evening of life in some kind of action : but he lasted out the entire journey , took up a land-claim up the Columbia River near . Willow Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing a man 's work every day till he was past ninety-five , and dying in peace and plenty , though with reluctance , at the age of a hundred and three . One was a cabinet-maker from Virginia who had lived in eight different States in almost as many years , and kept moving because there was something wrong with all of them . His wife said he had once tried to hang himself when she balked on moving so much , and came so near doing it that she resigned herself to following along whenever he felt the call . She was drowned afterward in crossing the john Day River , and he set up a furniture-mending shop in one of the valley-towns , in which he remained the rest of his life without ever venturing outside the city-limits . What he had really wanted , seemingly , was not so much to keep on the move himself as to keep her on it . There was a young couple from Ohio who quarreled all the time , and threw things at each other : butcher-knives , skillets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects that came handy . They talked eagerly between set-tos about the quiet and domestic accord that life in the new western country would bring them , but he committed suicide a year or two after they got there , and she remarried and bore eleven children , mourning his loss more deeply with every new one .  | Another young man who was emigrating because of a disappointment in love later took up with a Nez Perce squaw , and was killed trying to hold up a gold-express out of Idaho during the mining-rush , and a pallid-featured young man from New England who was emigrating for his health made a complete recovery before the journey was three-fourths over , and was drowned crossing the Snake River a couple of days after he had announced himself as cured . A final sample of the vagrant sparks thrown off by the country 's civilization was a small hoop-topped wagon drawn by one mule and one ox , with nothing in it except a few quilts , some pots and pans , and three or four sides of fat pork . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lanternjawed man with no chin , his wife with a wad of snuff under her lip , and five boys and eight girls herding a lank cow , four starved dogs , and a two-year-old colt with hollow eyes and a deep cough . The boys fought over riding the colt when they went through a settlement , and got off again when they had passed it , having discovered that it took more foot-work to keep the poor animal moving than it did to walk . The girls trudged along in the dust without noticing anything , merely keeping up with the wagon , and tired of doing it before they were much more than started . Nobody knew what led such outfits to undertake a project like emigrating all the way across the plains . It may have been because other people were doing it , and there was always an exciting feeling about following the crowd . It never appeared to strike them that the other people might object to having a family along that was not equipped or supplied for such a journey , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take care of over the hardest part of it . It would n't have mattered much if it had . When such households were refused membership in one emigrant-train , they usually sat down to wait for the next one , which threw them on somebody 's hands to feed and take care of exactly as if they had joined  | it . Of the ones that struck out by themselves , some broke down and had to be helped out , which was what they had counted on to begin with , and others merely disappeared and were never seen again . From those came the accumulation of rumors about white girls being held captive by Indians which kept the army busy for years afterward sending out military expeditions and fighting desultory and vicious little Indian wars to settle . Sometimes it turned out that there actually were white girls from some lost emigrant-wagon in captivity , and they were rescued and restored to civilization , at an averII age cost to the government of from two to three million dollars apiece . Considering what merely a dozen such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have paid all emigrants of the Toothaker breed a subsidy to stay at home , if anybody had only thought of it . The Toothakers did at least help Ruhama and Askwani to a prompt crossing on the overworked little rope-ferry at the border of the Shawnee Indian Reserve , in spite of the four or five square miles of emigrant families who were camped on the prairie back of it waiting their turn to cross . Some had been waiting for three weeks when the youngsters drove their cart in among the tents and parked wagons , keeping far enough behind the Toothakers to be clear of the dust . One of the Toothaker youths was riding their windbroken little pony through the camps , and he pulled up at a little shackgrocery to ask about the tar-barrel and long-handled dipper that such places kept set out for passing wagons to grease their wheels with . He let the wagon get almost out of sight before the storekeeper got the barrel and its uses all explained to him , and then stirred his pony in the flanks to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left behind , struck out at a run , and the loose cattle , supposing it was some herder after them , started to gallop . The line of wagon-oxen took in after them , whereupon all the oxen stampeded all the way down the road to the ferry . Wagons lurched and bounced , women  | screamed , children bawled , men yelled and ran and swore , camps , clotheslines , lean-tos and shelter-canvases went down in the fog of dust like strawstacks in a cyclone . The ground shook with hoofs beating and wagons pounding , furniture and bedding spilled out , wagons tipped over , and the dust fogged up among the lurching white canvas tops till they looked like gray moths being beaten along the ground by a thunderstorm . Nobody tried to head off the runaway teams . If let alone , ox-teams always kept to a straight course till they had run themselves out . If guided or checked , they would veer sharply sideways , capsizing the wagon and sometimes twisting the main coupling in two like a stick of warm molasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any control to have taken hold , anyway . It was all over in ten minutes , but that was as much time as Ruhama and Askwani needed . When the dust cleared so they could see the river , the ropeferry had pulled in , the wagons that had crowded the landing waiting their turn were gone , scattered out across the prairie with tops wrecked , wheels and couplings broken , furniture and bedding spilled out , teams tangled and yokes splitand traces snarled , and people strewn out among the ruins like the casting forth of sinners at the Last Judgment . The ferry shoved into the landing without being so much as noticed by the campers who had waited for days and even weeks for their turn at it . The Indian ferryman nodded to Askwani , and he led his saddle-pony and the cart-horse on board and stood by their heads till the ferry moved out into the river . When there was clear water between them and the landing , he and Ruhama went and stood by the stern-gate and looked back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have expected , considering the rumpus it had made . The camp looked , as they drew away from it , much like some of the flower-patches in the grass around it . The colors of the  | women 's and children 's dresses , the men 's shirts and scattered bedding and spare clothes strung out on the wrecked clotheslines , were brighter and gayer-looking than they had been at close range . The canvas wagon-covers looked whiter and bigger , and the red and blue and green of the wagons , the red and white of the oxen , gained vividness with distance as if from some brightening property in the air . By the time the ferry drew in to the landing on the far bank , all the panic and loss and injury of the scared oxen running had been toned away to a mere pattern of shapes and colors , with no more association with human hopes or disasters than the loose petals scattered through the grass by some skift of rain . When they had turned away from the river into the open prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented , in the face of their own problems : picking places to rest the cart-horse , keeping track of the road-marks Warne had given them to follow , caring for the baby .  | C H A P T E R T H I R T E E N THE BABY WAS A CHUNKY LITTLE BLACK-HAIRED URCHIN , ROBUST and self-reliant and already able to walk and talk , though she took little interest in doing either . She had a strong streak of Indian patience , balanced by an even stronger one of Indian contrariness . She could stand being jolted by the cart for hours without a murmur . On long pulls where the wheels would hoist and bump first on one side and then on the other like a skiff in a cross-chop , she would go placidly to sleep , letting her head roll limply with the motion of the cart till a man would have sworn her neck was broken , and wake as bright and rested as if she had been dandled on thistledown . To offset that , her notions about diet were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got used to having milk to drink , and she insisted on still having it , though she was old enough to have done without it , and there were dozens of other aliments almost as nutritious and far easier to carry . Milk on the road spoiled in two days , even when there was enough of it to last that long . It had to be bought from roadside farms , usually with long explanations about what it was for , who the cart belonged to , where they were going in it , whether they were n't too young for such a trip , and what their folks had been thinking of to let them undertake it . Nevertheless , the baby stood out for milk and refused any substitute for it , so they continued to buy it wherever they could . Most farms had it . Even after they crossed the river from the emigrant-camp ,  | they were able to keep buying it from the Shawnee and Delaware Indian settlements on the edge of the open country . The Shawnees and Delawares were eastern Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not impede civilization 's progress in that area . Either out of contrariness or merely to show that there were no hard feelings , they had settled down on their new lands to become civilized themselves . They did a lively clandestine business in receiving slaves stolen out of Texas by the wild Comanche and Caddo and Tonkawa tribes of the south , and reselling them to planters across the line in Missouri . Their farms were all well-kept , with handsome houses and barns , flourishing gardens , and expensive horses . Most of them kept milkcows , and sold milk willingly , though they were sharp bargainers . Their ability to squeeze the last cent out of anything they sold was bitterly complained of by travelers , especially those from the eastern seaboard , who felt that there was something unfair about Indians developing business acumen after they had been thrown off their ancestral lands for not having it . Nothing provokes so deep a sense of injury in man as simpletons who refuse to remain simple . There was milk while the Indian farms lasted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one left in sight . Beyond it , the road was merely a wagon-track through the grass , reaching up a series of long benches to the sky . The milk was all gone ; the baby had spent the morning between demands for something to eat and indignant refusals of everything they offered , and had settled down to a spell of steady and monotonous weeping , which rose high and indignant whenever they tried to bait her with eggs , corn-bread , fruit , turkeybroth , or anything except the one thing they did n't have . Even the old cart-horse stirred himself to a trot as they neared the farmhouse , in his anxiety to have it over with . They pulled up in front of the house . Askwani blocked the wheel with a rock , and went in with a bucket . The baby  | resumed crying , being too practiced a hand to let up when the enemy showed signs of yielding . A hen cackled from beyond the corn-patch . A rat-tail buzzard circled far up in the sky , the sun blazing greenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long dangling tail-feather giving it the look of coursing the airy fastnesses on a broomstick . The little killdeer plovers that had spent the morning legging it along the road ahead of the cart scattered into the grass to wait till it started again . Askwani came back with the bucket . It was still empty , but he had a gourd-dipper of milk which the baby consented to drink after trying unsuccessfully to spill it . He put the bucket back into the cart , looking less apologetic about it than he should have . " It would n't have lasted us far enough to help much , " he said . " It would be all soured by tomorrow night , and there ai n't any place past here where there 's any more . There ai n't anything past here except open country , these people say . They do n't sell anything to travelers unless it 's somebody special , but they remembered your father . He stopped here on his way out . They remembered how some of the women helped him with the baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We knew that already , " Ruhama said . The dipper of milk had quieted the baby , but its effect would be only temporary . It might have been better to have saved it for somewhere farther along the road . " What difference is it whether they remembered my father or not ? What we need is milk . Enough to last till tomorrow would have helped that much , anyway . " It showed they was n't out to swindle us , " Askwani said . Having her father remembered in such a place had given him confidence in himself . He was almost high-spirited . " I bought a cow from ' em . For thirty-two dollars . To take along with us . We can lead her behind the cart like some of them emigrant-outfits back at the river . " It was true , some of the emigrant-outfits had been equipped  | with milk-cows . The Toothakers had one . It was true that hauling a cow along at a cart-tail all day was n't likely to help her milking-qualities , but that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cow looked as if the Shawnees ' recollecting her father had been a deliberate playing on Askwani 's feelings for the purpose of overcharging him . Ruhama told him so , and he set his mouth and said there was no such thing to it . " They would n't go to all that trouble to swindle us on one cow , " he said . " They do n't sell cattle , and they would n't have sold this one to anybody else . They would n't have sold her to us if I had n't argued with ' em . The thirty-two dollars was n't only for the cow . There 's a calf goes with her . It ai n't weaned , so they throwed it in . They 're bringin ' ' em both in from the pasture now . " Ruhama studied on it . The addition of the calf made the bargain not better , but worse . It would be extra work to look out for , and it was perfectly useless to them . Still , the baby was tuning up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sure way to augment the milk-supply , and even submitting to a holdup cattle-price looked better than having to listen to that again . " It 's all right , I guess , " Ruhama conceded . " The money 's back in the chest , I 'll get it for you . I wish they had n't told you this was the last place we 'd see . Maybe it 's better for us to know it , but I 'd sooner not . We ought to make them count the calf out of the price . We do n't want it . " " They would n't do it , " he said . " They only agreed to sell the cow because they wanted to get rid of the calf . It wo n't wean , and they did n't want to kill it . They do n't kill cattle till they 're full-grown ; they do n't believe in it . So they had it on their hands . " He moved one of the lines so the carthorse would n't step on it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They remembered these old brass hameknobs on your father 's wagon-team . They asked about the  | backbands that had them brass studs in ' em . I 'd forgot all about ' em . " " Did you remember to tell them he was dead ? " she asked sharply . Her road-weariness and anxiety made her irritable . It was no time and no place to be leafing over useless memories with strangers . " They probably ran their price up on the strength of remembering things about him . Maybe they 'd have come down if you 'd told them about that ; yes , and how it happened , and who was to blame for it . If we 'd got off the steamboat that night when I wanted to , my father would still ? " No . It was unjust and querulous to bring up such a thing . She tried to temper it down , feeling sorry she had let it get away from her . " I 'm afraid of country like this , and these people . I 'm afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to turn around and go back . We could find some road down into the Territory that had towns and farms along it , if we asked . It would be safer . " " It would n't be the one your father wanted us to take , " Askwani said . The Indian from the house came hauling their new cow past the corn-patch , the calf shadowing him cautiously at a distance . " What happened that night on the steamboat was the best I could see to do . It would have come out better if your father had been there to help with it . This road ahead of us is something he has helped with . He laid out for us to take it , and I promised him we would , and we will . I 'd be afraid not to . . . . Another thing these people remembered was them old bone spreader-rings on his wagon-harness . They tried to buy ' em from him , they said . " His mildness did n't mean that he accepted her accusations meekly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on , to be at the road ahead and test out the directions he had memorized for it . She suspected that he would have held for that road if there had been a dozen better ones in plain sight , merely to keep Warne 's directions for it from going to waste . Talking about Warne with the Shawnees  | in the farmhouse had raised his spirits and his confidence . The improvement was almost worth the amount the Shawnees had overcharged him for the cow , though she fell considerably below their representations as a road-animal . She refused to lead behind the cart , and came so near hanging herself hauling back that they let her loose and tried leading the calf instead . It behaved no better , but it weighed less and was easier for the cart-horse to drag when it balked . It seesawed along at the tail of the cart , sometimes resignedly and sometimes not , and the cow plodded after it to see what was going to happen to it , sometimes turning back as if to leave and then thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . When they entered the open prairie , she got over her suspiciousness and stayed close to the cart as if afraid to let it out of her sight . Even that much company against the loneliness and emptiness was better than nothing . BEYOND THE SHAWNEE SETTLEMENTS , THEIR ROAD CROSSED A series of long bench-lands that lifted beyond them farther than they could see . They traveled unhurriedly , having nothing behind to run away from and no appointments to keep ahead . Wherever there was water , they stopped , and Askwani dismounted and blocked the cart to rest the horse while Ruhama wandered out to look at the flower-patches , taking the baby along when it was awake and manageable . Springs were plentiful , they had everything to eat that the widow and her daughters had been able to crowd into the cart , and the only shadow of trouble was arguing over the Indian superstitions that Askwani dragged out of his memory and wanted to experiment with . At one place where a spring had spread out into a long puddle in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of a mile on each side to find out which way it ran before crossing it with the cart . It was one of the deathliest omens in the world , he maintained , to carry  | a baby across water with its head pointing downstream , and the only way to be safe was not to cross till he discovered which way downstream was . He had his search for nothing . The water , as it turned out , did n't run in either direction ; it merely seeped into the road and stood there , but that did n't discourage him . At their next camp , the baby was fretful and whimpery with what seemed to be teething , and he insisted earnestly that it could be relieved instantly and completely by rubbing its gums with live minnows . There were n't any minnows in the spring where they were camped , to his disappointment , and the baby 's spell of contrariness kept up all the next day . When they drew in sight of the timber at Hundred and Ten Mile Creek in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a girl could be changed into a boy by feeding her nine green persimmons . It was the green-persimmon season , and he was all for trying it on the baby , reasoning that if it accomplished nothing else the sudden transformation might scare her into behaving herself . Ruhama refused to hear to it . It was probably true that it would have had some effect . Nobody could eat nine green persimmons without changing into something , but there were too many possible transformations that might be worse . THEY RESTED FOR A DAY AT HUNERED AND TEN MILE CREEK . It was the first running water they had struck since entering the open prairie . It was a feeder-stream for the Alaris des Cygnes , so they dipped from water that reached south through the lands of the Sacs and Foxes , Chippewas , Ottawas , Peorias , Kaskaskias , and on into the wild Osage country bordering the buffalo-ranges . The timber where they pitched camp was sycamore , elm , oak , hickory , mulberry , walnut and sassafras . In the open spaces there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beds of butterfly-weed and wild  | bergamot that drew humming-birds and red tanagers and clouds of blue butterflies . Toward evening a flock of wild parrots flew in to feed on the wild plums down the creek , and showed so much inquisitiveness about the baby that it got over its ill-temper in watching them . They were green-andgold in color , and they took turns settling on a low-hanging tree-limb a couple of yards away from it , and turning themselves upside-down on the very tip-end twig while they studied it first out of one eye and then out of the other . Life was probably as serious to them as it was to human beings , but it was impossible to watch them and feel that there was any great amount of seriousness about anything . Grouse began clucking along the creek toward late morning , and when Ruhama and Askwani went to hunt for seeded grass to stake the cow in they found the carcasses of half-adozen wild turkeys scattered in the openings between the trees , all fresh-killed and all headless , as if somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against using them . There seemed nothing wrong with them , but Ruhama could n't help feeling that anything so easily acquired must have something menacing about it , and she refused to touch them . Later , when the sun was squarely overhead and the smoke of their fire standing straight up in the noon stillness , they heard the whistle of a hawk swooping , and the noise of turkeys running , and realized that the headless turkeys had been merely the hawk 's leavings . It struck at the turkeys ' heads , which were red and visible from far up in the air . When it hit its mark and lifted off the ground , the head pulled off , the hawk flew on its way with merely that much of its quarry , and the rest of the body remained behind on the ground , killed as cleanly as if it had been done for a high-toned hotel . Ruhama and Askwani gathered up as many of the dropped carcasses as they could carry between them , and brought them into camp to cook . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wild turnip called  | pomme-blanche , and added them to the haul . In the afternoon a party of bee-hunters came past from the south , and traded a wooden bucket full of broken honeycomb and some blue squaw-corn for a couple of the turkeys . After they had gone on their way , the notion struck Ruhama to see how much of what they needed to eat could be gathered from the country as they went along , and how much of their supplies in the cart they could do without . They picked wild plums down the creek late in the afternoon , as a start . They could have killed grouse that came to water along the creek toward sundown , but they forbore that , being already overstocked with turkeys , and only picked a few handfuls of wild raspberries from some bushes the birds had missed . They moved on to Switzler 's Creek for their next camp . It was only ten or twelve miles to Switzler 's Creek : not much over half of an average day 's traveling for them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek came into sight across the prairie almost from the time they started , and they plodded toward it for hours without appearing to gain on it an inch . To the eye , the prairie around them looked perfectly level . Actually , it was a series of long swells rising one behind the other on a steady up-grade . The unending drag of the cart against it and the monotony of toiling ahead without the faintest change in scenery or skyline or distances wore hard on them . On the old cart-horse it was even harder . When a horse is unable to see that his work is accomplishing anything or moving toward any visible end , he loses heart and spirit for it . The cart-horse took to spacing out his rest-periods for himself , without waiting for any signal of the reins . At the end of every half-hour or so , he would halt , drop his head despondently between his forelegs , and wait for Askwani to dismount and block a wheel for him . In most places , there was nothing handy to block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedging his foot back of it . Along in the afternoon , he complained that the pressure  | from the iron tire had made his foot sore . They hunted out a rock to use instead , but it took time and work lifting it out and hoisting it back into the cart at every stopping-place , and he finally threw ' it away and went back to using his foot again . Such things were all a matter of getting used to , he explained , and the quicker he started the quicker it would be over with . Their camp at Switzler 's Creek was in the edge of the grove , near a cold spring that came out of a limestone ledge and ran a bright little stream down through the woods out of sight . There was an old log-cabin set back among the trees , built by some wandering spirit back in the early days , and long since abandoned and fallen into ruin . Ruhama was too tired to hunt through the timber for anything new to eat , but she found lamb's-quarter and wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She picked them to cook for greens , though they were trimmings rather than food . There were several trees of ripe mulberries in a deep-wooded ravine a few miles beyond , but they were tasteless and hard to reach , and most of them had been spoiled by the birds . Beyond the wooded ravine , the road lifted in a steep upgrade to cross a ridge , and then sloped down to a chain of water-holes where some Indians of the country were camped to hunt deer . Their tepees looked like those in pictures , except that the material was tattered old blankets and wornout wagon-canvas . The men were unsociable , and kept at a distance , but one of the squaws came out and swapped an armload of purple corn for one of the baby 's old dresses . She explained that the camp belonged to a chief , and that she was his wife ; or at least she was one of them . He had three . She pointed the other two out , working around one of the tepees while he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrinkled , and almost doddering in appearance , but his three wives were all young and spirited-looking . All three of them had babies of exactly the same size and age , which  | proved that he spared no exertion to divide his favors impartially between them , however little he might feel like it . Beyond the Indian camp , they came to another chain of half-dry waterholes called Bluff Creek . It was a relief to Askwani to find it where Warne had told him it would be , but the road down into it was so steep and deep-rutted that they had to rest the cart-horse every ten yards and drag one of the cart-wheels with a young tree-trunk to help him hold it back . Even the cow and calf were tired when they reached the bottom , but the water was scummy and brackish , so they stopped at it only for the night , and moved on the next morning to Rock Creek , where there were trees and grass , and a clear spring that spilled down into a bright stone basin big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ripe grass to put the cow on , the youngsters passed patches of wild red gooseberries along the creek , and wild strawberries in the open swales , and thickets of wild cherries where the trees thinned out downstream . There were scatterings of wild squashes and pomme-blanche , a kind of sweet-potato called camote , and patches of wild bean-vine , besides such trimmings as watercress , onions and nasturtium-vine . There was so much that it seemed useless to start gathering in any of it without something to carry it to camp in , and so late that they decided to leave it until morning and then take the whole day to it . They marked down the places they would need to come back to , found a stand of headed grass for the cow and led her out to it , and spent the rest of the daylight pitching the little tent back of the cart for Ruhama and the baby , and eating supper . She slept to the sound of the horses eating and the water splashing down into the stone basin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness on the carthorse . He had the fire already started . His bow was strung and leaned against one of the cart-wheels , with some arrows in the grass beside it . His mouth was set so that there was a palish ring around it , and there was blood on his hands . He  | explained , still working with the harness , that it was n't his . It was the cow 's . She had run into a herd of javalinas down the creek , and they had knocked her over and killed her . Javalinas were a species of native wild hog that ranged the northern prairie in those times . They were later crowded out by humanity , along with the buffalo , grouse , prairie-chickens , wild turkeys , elk , antelope , wild parrots , and open country . They were ordinarily shy and unobtrusive , but they could fight , and did so unhesitatingly when there was any reason for it . It was probable that the cow had wandered too close to some litter of their young , since they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely for playfulness . She was so far gone when Askwani found her that there was nothing to do except finish their work for them . He had done it , and now he was getting the camp struck to move . They would have to give up going back to the berry-patches and places they had marked to harvest in . There would n't be time for such things ; they had to get as far along the road as they could while their milk-supply held out . The calf was no use to them with the cow gone , and he thought they had better turn it loose and leave it , but on that point Ruhama turned stubborn . " We 'll take it with us , " she said . " It 's all we 've got to show for the money those Indians overcharged us , and I wo n't have it left here to get killed . I do n't see what hurry there is about leaving . There wo n't be milk farther along , any more than there is here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Askwani said . It was true , they did n't . Nobody knew the open prairie well enough to know what it would turn up next . Its limitless possibilities were one of the beauties of life in it . " We might run into some more squaws like the ones back at that deercamp . They all had babies . If we can strike any more like ' em , we might run one down and milk her . We could cinch a rope around her and twist it tight with a stick so she would n't  | act up . That 's how they break cows to milk . A squaw ought to be as easy to educate as most cows , I guess . " " I do n't want to hear any more of that , " Ruhama said sharply . " We 'll go on , if you 're set on it , but we wo n't go without that calf . Put the rope back on it , so you 'll remember to take it . Then help me with this tent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . " " It twinges a little sometimes , " Askwani said . He tossed his bow and arrows into the cart and put the rope back on the calf and helped her strike the tent , all in silence . None of their arguments ever got carried far since Warne 's death . Their love for him had held them in a kind of offhanded understanding while he was alive , but it divided them now that he was dead . They had loved him for different things , which had seemed vaguely identical because he had kept them centered in himself . Now that he was gone , the differences showed more plainly , and so did the differences between themselves . Askwani 's hurry to leave the camping-place at Rock Creek was not as severely practical as he let on . Part of it was merely more Indian superstition working out in him . As they were leaving , Ruhama noticed that the cart-horse 's mane had been cut short for a handbreadth forward of his withers . Hunting around , she found the clipped lock caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was woven into a small double-loop , so close-knit and hard-twisted that cutting it had been the only way to get rid of it . In country where such things happened , people believed that the loops were the work of a witch , who used them for stirrups to ride the horse around on her nefarious errands all night . It was the rankest kind of superstition . Actually , nobody had any idea what the loops were caused by . In later times , when people stopped believing that witches were back of it , it stopped happening . It was childish of Askwani to let such a thing hurry him into leaving a place where such quantities of fruits and berries and wild vegetables were waiting to be  | gathered , but Ruhama knew that she was not much less childish in wanting to squander traveling-time on gathering them . There was food enough in the cart without them ; some of it was threatening to spoil because they had not got around to using it . It was better to give in to his childishness a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on the baby . They persuaded her to accept substitutes , since it was that or nothing , but she took to whimpering over small inconveniences  --  the heat , the flies , the jolting of the cart , the noises around their camp at night  --  and she developed patches of skin-rash that refused to go away , and insect-bites that inflamed and fevered and refused to heal . Anxiety over her kept them from staying longer than overnight at Council Grove . It was a place noted for its beauty , and , besides the wild cherries Warne had remembered , there were beds of yellow and white primroses , swarms of birds among the trees , and patches of cucumber-root and wild collards and ripe black gooseberries . They might have found more if they had looked , but it would have made leaving harder . They loaded their camp in the early dawn , and moved on by the old freight-road to the next camping-place , at the water-hole called Diamond Spring . It was the first camp they had made out in the open prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel . The horse was jaded and dispirited , and refused to graze . The baby cried , not loudly , but in a low self-communing whimper as if ignoring them , which was worse . The only good thing about the place was a thicket of gooseberry-bushes below the spring . Birds had taken all the gooseberries , but the dead brush fur1 nished fuel enough for a cooking-fire . Half-a-dozen Indians rode in from the open grass as they were finishing supper , and drew up in a line to watch them . There were five men and one young squaw . The men ranged from a half-grown youth with nothing on except buckskin leggings and a flap to an old man of around sixty who  | wore an army dress-coat and pantaloons made out of bedticking . The squaw was dressier : she had on a buckskin jumper , dyed green , and a large flowered calico skirt . Her hair was parted and slicked down tight , and her scalp all the way along the parting was stained blazing scarlet . Only the half-naked youth could talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that their camp was in a wallow a few hundred yards off , and that they had come over to find out what the baby 's whimpering was . At a distance , they had n't been sure , and there had been an argument about it . Askwani explained about the milk running out , watching them close and making it brief , but they made no attempt to steal anything . They merely listened , and then conferred together , and the youth informed Ruhama that , if milk was all that was the trouble , she must bring something to carry it in . She got a bucket from the cart , and followed them out through the gooseberry-thicket to the wallow where their camp was . The camp was merely some ragged canvas draped on poles , with an open space in front where some older squaws were at work preparing buffalo-meat to dry . The system they used for preparing it was to cut the meat into strips about six inches wide and a foot long , and string them on thongs , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , all the way from its shoulders to its tail , and left there to the sun and air . The horse moving around made it dry faster , and it protected the animal from insects . Several of the horses were completely covered with strings of it , one layer overlapping the next like shingles . There was no sign of any milk around the camp , but the young squaw took Ruhama 's bucket , spread back a layer of meat-strips from one of the drying-mares , and proceeded to milk her into it . Not every range-pony would have stood for such treatment , but the mare had been through worse . Her forelegs were scarred with rope-burns , she had one split ear , her nostrils had been slit back an inch  | on each side to improve her wind , and she had been scorched on both fore-shoulders with a hot iron to limber her up . Merely being milked into a stranger 's bucket was probably an outing for her . She gave no sign of minding it , at least , merely letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's motion in milking her , and shifting her weight with a sigh when it was over . The young squaw gave the bucket back half-full . It looked like milk , and Ruhama did her best to look grateful for it , and not to show her dubiousness about using it . She took the bucket back to the cart and set it in the back until she could gather enough nerve to throw it out . The baby continued to whimper loud enough to be heard over in the Indian camp , and finally she gave it a few experimental swallows of the fluid , merely to see what it would do . The baby drank almost a third of the entire donation without stopping , and went to sleep for the first time since they had left Rock Creek . They spent a quiet night , and moved on at daylight without seeing any more of the Indians who had donated it . Beyond Diamond Spring , the prairie met the sky in a circle all around them . Traveling across it was like crawling up the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they always remained at the bottom . The only sign that they were making distance was the grass . It began to thin out and show patches of naked ground by mid-afternoon . Around the Poison Spring , which they passed without stopping , there was scarcely anything but naked ground in sight . The grass had regained the upper hand by the time they drew in sight of the Cottonwood Fork , but it was no longer the toughsodded prairie-grass of the benchlands . It was buffalo-grass , which had no sod at all , stood only two or three inches high , and curled even that scant length back against the ground to form a pale white-green mat that felt springy underfoot like moss . It even looked like some species of bleached-out moss . For all of its unpretentious appearance , it was the best  | forage-grass that ever existed . Even barn-raised livestock preferred it to any cultivated feed , and throve better on it . An outfit of New Mexico Spaniards trailing mules to the St. Louis market was camped in the grove at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had turned their entire herd out to graze , and all the animals  --  saddle-horses , a few cattle , and fifty or sixty mules  --  were working on the buffalo-grass so absorbedly that they bumped into each other without even looking up . They paid not the least attention to the masses of blackbirds swarming around to catch the mosquitoes that lit on them . Sometimes a mule would saunter across to a new feeding-spot with a dozen blackbirds teetering on his backbone and chattering excitedly over the unaccustomed motion , and drop his head and resume feeding without so much as a backward glance to see what they were up to . It was a fair exchange , as far as that went . The mosquitoes would have been unbearable without something to keep them thinned down , and the mules lured them into alighting so the birds could nail them . The youngsters drew into the camping-ground in the grove long after sundown . The men around the Spaniards ' camp looked uncordial and standoffish as they drove past , so they moved on a couple or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not to appear intrusive , and Askwani hurried to take the two horses and the calf out to pasture , leaving Ruhama to start unloading their camp by herself . He was gone a long time . It was full dark , and she had the camp all pitched and supper started by the time he came back . He explained that he had run into a couple of the Spaniards ' herders out on the pasture , and , since one of them could talk a little English , he had been visiting with them . Their outfit belonged to a big Santa Fe merchant , oldish and very wealthy . He was taking the herd of mules to St. Louis to trade in on a new season 's stock for his store , and he was as nervous and streaky about it as a cat on a hot rock , because the coun-  | try around the Cottonwood crossing was noted for outlaws and road-agents . Only a couple of years earlier , another Santa Fe trader had been murdered a few miles west of the campground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash , and a couple of wagonloads of valuable furs . The herders thought their employer was probably as well-heeled , and maybe better . If uneasiness and scariness were any indication , he was carting enough cash and negotiable property with him to square up the national debt . " If he 's afraid of robbers around here , what 's he stopped here for ? " Ruhama said , feeling in the back of the cart for a dipper . " He had to on account of his mules , " Askwani said . " He 's got to keep ' em in shape , or they wo n't sell for anything . Buffalo-grass will fill ' em out better than anything else , and this is the last of it they 'll strike . The herders said ? What 's that you 're givin ' the baby ? That ai n't the milk you got from them Indians , is it ? " The baby finished off the dipper of milk , spilled the usual last few drops on herself , and lay back to sleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ruhama said . She was a little uneasy about it . " I gave her some of it last night , and it has n't hurt her . That was why she slept so well . " " You do n't know what it 'll do to her , " Askwani said . " Milk from a wild old Indian mustang like that . She might take it into her head to run wild herself , when she gits big enough . She might run off with some outfit of blanket-Indians , and dye the part in her hair red , and eat dog . She might marry some hump-shouldered old buck with a plug in his nose and four or five other wives already . " " People give children milk from range-cows , " Ruhama said . " Some of them are as wild as that old Indian mustang , and a lot meaner . Children drink milk from them , and it does n't do anything . " " You do n't know whether it does or not , " Askwani said .  | " Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all of ' em . If it did do anything , nobody 'd notice it . I do n't know whether that old mare 's milk 'll do any harm or not , but your father would n't like for you to use it , and I wish you 'd stop . " " I 'll have to , " Ruhama said . " It 's almost all gone . I had to give the baby something so she would n't squall all night . I did n't want her to bother those people over in the other camp . They look cranky enough without that . " " The whole outfit 's as touchy as a cub-bear with a sore toe , " Askwani said . " They could n't be any worse if we all squalled all night . If anybody was to jump out of the bushes and flap a blanket at ' em , or something like that , I 'll bet ? " He fell silent , staring at the gleam of their fire in the creekwater . " There was some things of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some wagon-tools , and that old pistol of his , and some things with it . Do you remember where you put ' em ? " Ruhama said her father 's things were all in the tool-chest . " You 're not going to take that pistol , though . It 's made trouble enough for us already . There 's nothing here that you need to use it on , and I want it left where it is . " Askwani continued to gaze pensively at the creek-water moving past in the dark . " I do n't intend to use it , " he said mildly . " You can take it out and hide it from me , if you want to . There was some things with it that I wanted to look at , that was all . " " What things ? " she demanded . " If you 're planning to do something , why do n't you say what it is ? Is it something you might get hurt at ? " He said there was n't much of anything to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . " It may not amount to anything . I 'll have to try it to see . If it does , I 'll tell you all about what it is . I wo n't know for sure myself till some time tomorrow , maybe . We 'll lay over for the day and rest up . If it  | do n't work out , we 'll have the horses fed up and rested , anybe it ' ' way . This foot of mine hurts tonight . Mays goin to rain . Them cottonwood-leaves is all still , too . That 's a si u hurts because you went on using it to hold the cart back after I told you not to . You can have anything in the tool-chest except the pistol , I guess . I 'll take that out and keep it till you 're through looking . " of rain . " " It 's not a sign of anything , " Ruhama said . " Your foot SHE TOOK THE PISTOL OUT AND KEPT IT OUT OF HIS REACH , BUT he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the tool-chest till late , and left early in the morning , carrying a collection of sortings from it in a sack . Ruhama spent the morning washing and draping things on bushes to dry . Toward afternoon she went out to see what was in the grove , leaving the baby picketed lightly to one of the cartwheels to discourage straying . It was late for flowers , but she found goldenrod and white desert-poppies and purple dogtooth violets . For fruits , there were wild strawberries and red wild plums ; for vegetables , there were ground-nuts , watercress , wild onions , and clusters of sego-bulbs that tasted like hazelnuts . There were no deer or turkeys , but there were prairie-chickens and antelope , and fish in the deep holes along the creek : sunfish , hickory-shad and black bass . There was probably more , but there was not time enough for her to hunt out everything . She felt half sorry that she had seen as much as she had . Leaving in the morning meant that they would not be able to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering was merely discovering how much would be left to go to waste . The second night in the grove was not restful , as the first had been . Askwani went out to the pasture about sundown to make sure the horses were grazing close , and stayed to keep  | watch on them . The New Mexican herders sang drearily in Spanish to keep themselves awake . The mules brayed at one another , and the baby squirmed and whimpered because the mare 's milk was all gone . A mist crept into the grove as the air chilled , and the moonlight scattered through it in a palegold incandescence that hid the ground and made the trees , the herders and their camp appear to be floating in a pool of cold flame . Toward daylight , it changed from gold to a blinding gray-white , and moisture dripped from the trees . The baby slept uneasily and woke up with a start at a sudden clatter of shots from out among the trees ; first three or four separate ones , half-muffled and hesitant-sounding , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the guards broke off their caterwauling and fell over each other grabbing for their firearms as Ruhama spread the tent-door and looked out . The mist was still heavy among the trees , but she saw them scrambling for cover and shooting into the grove without troubling to aim . More men came out of the tents , and the old merchant appeared behind them in his nightshirt , yelling orders , and began yanking loose the tent-ropes . A herder came driving a dozen scared horses into the middle of the camp , and men began catching and throwing saddles on them . A tent fell down . A horse stepped in a bucket and tried to run with his foot caught in it ; a herder yanked it loose , struck the horse over the head with it , and threw it as far as he could send it . There was another flurry of shots from out among the trees , and one of the wagons drove past with the old merchant bouncing on the seat and tucking his nightshirt into his trousers with the barrel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tent along the ground behind it . Some pack-horses went lumbering after it , trying to rub their packs off against the trees . The herders hazed them along from behind , still shooting aimlessly into the woods and adjusting cinch-straps and bridle-buckles as they went . The  | foliage was still quivering from their departure when Askwani came leading the two horses into the clearing beside the cart , and stood holding them till the thumping , yelling , shooting and braying had dwindled away into the distance . " That 's one camp that got moved in a hurry , " he said . He was excited , she could tell , though he managed to sound casual . " They did n't leave anything , either , it do n't look like . " " I 'm sorry for the way I acted about that pistol , " Ruhama said . " I did n't know there 'd be anything like this . I 'll get it for you , if you think you 'll need it . " He did n't appear much impressed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be simpler to pull camp and leave , and began throwing the harness on the carthorse while she hurried to bring in her laundry from the bushes where she had spread it to dry . They loaded the cart in silence and haste , and drove two or three miles past the grove before he drew rein . He nodded , and turned down a gully to a patch of scrub-willows . It was too rough to follow with the cart , but Ruhama saw that there was a cow in the middle of the willow-patch . She had on a long picket-rope , and had tangled it among the branches so it held her . Askwani untangled it and led her back to the cart with it . He tied it firmly to the back-axle so she would lead behind , and turned the cart but she said nothing . He always told more when she waited him out . " I saw a man whipped once , back in Running Water when I was a tad , " he said . " They stripped off his shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot-whip . He fell over it and bawled about halfway through it , and a couple of men held him up so they could finish . They told me not to feel sorry for him . He was a thief , they said , and that was what thieves deserved . I 'm a thief now . This cow belonged to that New Mexico outfit . I stole her . "  | " She was tangled in that willow-brush , and they 'd gone away and left her , " Ruhama said . " She 'd have died there if you had n't found her . What 's stealing about that ? " " I sneaked her out of their herd last night and brought her out here , " Askwani said . " I put that rope on her and tangled it in the brush myself . Then I went down into the grove and bored holes in a log with your father 's auger and tamped some of his old pistol-cartridges into ' em , and set a candle to burn down and touch ' em off after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . I figured the herders might scout around to make sure they had n't left anything , and I thought if they found her in that brush-pile they would n't know who 'd took her . They was in too much of a hurry to look , so here she . is . They 'd brought her along to milk for the old man 's table , so she 'll milk . I made sure of that before I stole her . " " You did right , " Ruhama said . " He wo n't miss one cow out of all that herd he 's got , and it wo n't hurt him if he does . They drove our calf away with them , anyway , so it 's only a trade . It is n't the same as stealing . You could have offered to buy her from them first , I suppose . " " They would n't have sold her , and I was afraid they might guard her close if they knew we wanted her , " Askwani said . " I 'd sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and the only way to make sure was to steal her . We 've got her now , I guess , if the old man do n't find that calf of ours and send some of his herders to bring it back to us . They might come back to hunt for the cow , as far as that goes . " " They did n't see us take her , " Ruhama said . " They would n't know where to look for us , anyway . They 'll think we 're still on the freight-road . " " They could trail us , " Askwani said . " Them herders could trail this cart easy enough . They may not think it 's worth the trouble , but they might . It 's the only thing I 'm uneasy about , anyway , and the faster we move out of here , the better off we 'll be . There ai n't anything else that we ? Stop the  | cart a minute , and see if you can find the lead-rope we took off of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead-rope out of the back . He took it to the rear of the cart and fastened it to the new cow , and took off the rope she had been caught in the willow-thicket by , coiling it neatly in half-arm loops as he drew the slack out of the cart . It was one that Ruhama had never seen before : a braided rawhide riata , almost new , and between sixty and seventy feet long . He finished coiling it , wound the ends so the coil would hold , and whirled it around his head and threw it down into the deep brush along the creek . " What did you do that for ? " she said . " We might have had some use for it . Where did you get it ? There was n't anything wrong with it , was there ? " " Nothing except that it did n't belong to us , " he said . " I had to have something to hold the cow with last night , and I did n't want to use anything that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal it from anybody . I found it in a tree over at the edge of the grove . We do n't want it . We 're better off without it . " He climbed on his pony , and sat for a second looking back at the grove . " You did n't give the baby any more of that old mustang 's milk , did you ? " It had all come from that , then . Her father would not have wanted the baby to drink milk from an Indian mustang , and ii all that he had done , all that had happened during the night , had come from his determination to prevent it . The rawhide riata made her realize how much he had been willing to risk to prevent it . The only place where he could have found such Ii a thing was on one of the burial-platforms that the wild Indians built in trees as depositaries for their dead . They always left a collection of useful articles for the dead man to use in the next world : a bow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and extra clothes , sometimes a scalp or two , always a riata and sometimes two or three of them . Askwani had got  | the rope for his cow-stealing by climbing up to a burial-platform and taking it from beside a dead body . He had thrown it away afterward because he was afraid of it . It had meant that much to him to keep Warne 's baby from a diet that Warne might have disapproved of . Ruhama had not realized before how much Warne still counted with him , and though she had given the baby the mare 's milk down to the last drop , she paid him the tribute of lying about it . " It was spoiled , " she said . " I threw the rest of it out . I did n't give her any more of it . " He shifted in his saddle , still riding beside the cart instead of ahead as he usually did . " It 's the light of the moon now , " he said . " That 's a good sign . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have luck . . . . I 'll be glad when we git out of here . "  | C H A P T E R F O U R T E E N BEYOND THE OLD BUFFALO-HUNTERS ' CROSSING OF COTTON wood Fork , the country turned thin and poor , with great patches of naked ground and only a skift of strawy grass between them . The water was in holes , mostly muddy and badsmelling , guarded by gigantic frogs and whooping-cranes that stood as tall as a man . Reptiles were abundant : big yellowand-black-spotted lizards , clumsy land-turtles , small gray rattlesnakes with black spots along the back . Other forms of animal-life were scarce : a few palish birds around the waterholes , and a few lean rabbits . In one place they came , unexpectedly , on the carcass of a buffalo lying in a shallow near the trail , with a ring of painted buzzards sitting around it motionless , watching it . It was as big as their cart , and the buzzards were four feet tall . Their bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped with black . They wore a ruff of long dangling neck-feathers , their heads were mottled red and orange , and their eyes were white circled with crimson . Being stared at by them was a memorable experience . Only a thoroughly dead animal could have stood it . Beyond that was a stretch of naked ground with nothing on it except giant puff-balls . They lay scattered around the dry blackish earth looking like bleached skulls . A few miles past them was a dry watercourse where Indians had camped for the winter , and the cottonwood-limbs they had fed their ponies on were gnawed bare , bleached white-gray , and tumbled and crisscrossed down the creek-bed like bones . A  | little farther on , there was the carcass of a dead prairie-wolf lying on its side in the middle of the trail . It was stiff and cold , its lips drawn back from yellowish spike-teeth , which were locked tight and covered with dried foam . There was nothing to show what had killed it . The painted buzzards ' dispassionate vigil over the buffalo-carcass had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark , and shunned in its death by every living thing , was harder to stop thinking of . Even the cart-horse quickened his pace and forgot about stopping to rest after they had passed it . A half-dozen miles beyond the dead wolf was a water-hole where the youngsters spread their camp . It was less water than thin mud , choked and stained by yellow pond-lilies , and ringed around with dry-stemmed spotted tulips , prairie-gourdvines , wild geranium that smelled like almonds , and a pinkish flower with a peachlike odor that clung to anything it touched and would n't wash off . The water was so rank and full-bodied that even the horses and cow drank it grudgingly , and had to be tied up to keep them from straying away in search of better . Warne 's directions had called for a spring among the rocks somewhere back of the camping-place , and Askwani insisted on staying until he had raked over every foot of the rock-break in search of it . He and Ruhama drank part of the milk from the cow , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing that they could eat at all . The cart-horse showed the effects of it most , lying down for long spells during the day and having to be roused and pulled at before he would get up ; but Askwani refused stubbornly to move on and let the spring go , for fear they might have taken some wrong turn and got themselves headed away from the route Warne had lined out for them . It took him three days to find it , because it had been matted over by dead weeds and half-covered with slide-rock . There was not much reason to be triumphant about it , for it had silted up so there was not water enough in it to dip without  | raking mud . Nevertheless , in spite of its uselessness and the time they had wasted on it , Askwani was triumphant over finding it . He had been afraid they were headed wrong because the spring was not where Warne had said it would be . Now he knew they were still headed right , because it was there , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had not once occurred to him , in the hours he had spent hunting through the rocks for some sign of it , that Warne might have been mistaken about it . THEY TRAVELED HARD AND CAMPED ONLY OVERNIGHT TILL THE bare prairie broke south into wooded country and grass and springs with running water . Then , with the old cart-horse beginning to labor and stumble even where the road was level , and having to be half-lifted in the bad stretches to keep him on his feet , they camped at a little spring between some small hills . Post-oak timber grew in the notches between the hills on both sides of their camp , and below it the water from the spring spread out into a little marsh , grown full of cat-tails , flowering bulrush and saw-grass . Around the marsh there was prairie-grass , patched with lupin , Indian paint-brush , whiteflowered indigo , and sweetbrier . They picked the place to camp in after a long day 's trip , hoping the deep grass might help the cart-horse over his indisposition , but Ruhama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling and camping beside stagnant water had worn her down and made her dull and feverish , coming at a time of the month when she was least able to stand such things . She felt almost beholden to the old cart-horse for breaking down first . He had saved her the trouble . It was late the next morning when the thunderstorm struck . She was lying down in her tent , looking at a sprig of sweetbrier growing out of the ground at the foot of her bed , and trying to imagine that she was clear of the Plains for good ,  | when the air outside turned dark , and a drift of huge white raindrops hit the ground and burst like overripe grapes . The air turned darker , and white rods of lightning stabbed through it and ripped the earth into jagged holes wherever it touched . The thunder that came with the lightning did not sound like thunder at all . It was like a series of shots , like the pistolcartridges Askwani had set off in the grove at Cottonwood , only closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stopped , and the rain began : a black sheet of it that beat through the tent-roof till the leaves of the sweetbrier at the foot of her bed were gray with spray . That changed to hail , huge stones of it that looked black as they fell and turned white when they hit , turning the hills and the marsh so gray and wraithlike that it was a shock to see how the tent-roof quivered and sagged with its weight piling up . The hail stopped , all at once and completely . The darkness was gone , the sun was out and the sky pale-blue and cloudless before the last of the hailstones had stopped bouncing . The ground all the way to the marsh was gray with them . In the marsh , the cat-tails and saw-grass had all been beaten down , with only a few twists of greenish-brown pulp protruding like beaver-houses above the muddy water . The grass around the marsh was flattened into a brownish mat that steamed grayish vapor as the sun warmed it . The flowerpatches were churned down so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Back on the road above the spring , the hailstones had piled in the wheelmarks of the cart too deep to melt , and its tracks stood out against the deadtoned landscape a solemn and accusing white , as if they were some tie between it and the open prairie that nature had reached out to strengthen and reassert . The tent moved , a weight of melting hailstones slid off the roof with a thump , and Askwani came in . He was palish around the mouth , and there was a little gathering of muscle on each side of his jaw . " It looks like you 'd made out all right , anyway , " he said . " I  | got the baby under the cart when it started , so she 's all right . That 's about all that is . The cow 's gone . She was down past the marsh somewhere , and now there ai n't any sign of her anywhere . I do n't even know which way she headed . The hail 's beat her tracks all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the saddle-pony . He tried to stampede when the hail hit , and I like to pulled my arms off holdin ' him , but I did . I do n't know what we 'd better do . We 'll have to figure out something . " He was working up to break it to her that they ought to pack up and move on , she thought . The grass around their camp was all knocked down and ruined , and even if the cow was lost , there were still the horses to think about . " I 'll do anything I can , but I could n't stand any more of that cart now , " she said . " I 'll be better tomorrow , I think . We do n't have to leave right away , do we ? " " If we did , we 'd be in a bad fix , " he said . " We ca n't . The cart-horse is down over among the trees , and it looks like it 's for good . I ca n't git him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoned him , I guess . Them New Mexican herders said something about a weed that would poison the white spots on a horse . He might have found some of it . The pony ai n't got any white spots on him , so he made it through all right . " She let that go . If he liked believing in such things , let him . There was little enough else . " Maybe the pony could take the cart the rest of the way . It 's not much farther to the Creek towns , is it ? " " Four days , maybe , " he said . " There 's some hard pulls to it , though , and he ai n't ever worked in harness , and he 's little . The three of us in the cart would be a load on him , and I 'd ? " He glanced down at the foot he had been using to block the wheel , put his weight on it cautiously , and drew in his breath . " It would be a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to do . We 'd be better off if we 'd got off that steamboat the night you wanted us to . I wish we 'd done it . "  | " No ! " she said . ' Wishing that anything in the past had been different was corrupting and dangerous . It was like dulling the edge of reality by taking drugs ; what actually got dulled was one 's will and understanding . " If we could make the Creek towns with the cart in four days , you can ride it in half that . Take the pony , and ride down there and buy us a work-horse that can handle the cart , and bring it back . I 'll wait here and rest up . Maybe I 'll feel like traveling again by the time you get back . " He studied it over . " I do n't like to do it . I do n't like to leave you alone like this . You would n't git much rest with the baby on your hands . " She had got him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pressed her gain hard . " You can take her with you . There 'll be women down there . My father said they were all right . You can leave her with one of them to keep till we bring the cart out . She can ride in front of you on the saddle ; there 's room . She 'll like it better than waiting here , probably . " He turned the tent-flap in his hands , frowning at it , and said he could probably stand it . " You 'll be here all by yourself , though . What if anything happened ? What if you got worse ? " " If I did , it would n't be anything you could help with , " she said . " We ca n't stay here , and we ca n't leave till we get a horse to pull the cart . There 's no place except those towns where we can get one and be sure of it . I 'll keep the pistol in here with mc . I know how to load it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go on and get ready to start . " She had been about to wish the camping-place had been more like some of the places they had hurried past with only an overnight halt : the grove at Rock Creek , maybe . But that would have more trying to remake the past , and she held it back . He left , and she heard him filling water-buckets and dragging firewood and flapping his saddle onto the pony . Finally he came back and stood in the tent-door again .  | " Here 's the pistol and the loads , " he said , and laid them beside her . " I got it out of the chest . I took enough money to buy the horse with ; it ought to be enough , anyway . You 're sure you want me to do this ? " " I 've already told you I did , " she said . " What good will it do to say it all over again ? You 're not afraid to go , are you ? " He said no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want you to remember who it was that thought this up , that 's all . It was n't me . It was you . Maybe it 's the best thing to do , but I would n't do it if you had n't held for it . As long as you still do , all right . The water-buckets is full . I got in wood enough to last you . I packed some things to take : clothes for the baby , and some things to eat . The pony 'll have a load on him . I 'd better start , I guess . " " The quicker you start , the quicker you 'll be back , " she said . " I 'll look for you in four days . " He lingered , shifting his feet . " The pistol 's loaded . You 'd better keep it where you can git at it , and do n't be afraid to use it if anything comes prowlin ' around . I 'll try to make it back in four days . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , " she said . " You 'd better get started . You wo n't be back in any four days if you put it off much longer . " He left . She heard the baby cry at being lifted into the saddle , and the creak of a stirrup-leather as he mounted , and the thump of the pony 's hoofs in the wet sod . He called something back to her , the sound of the hoofs got faint and died away , and loneliness began to bear in on her . She had expected to feel it , but not so soon . In spite of it , she was glad Askwani had finally agreed to something she had brought up . It was sensible for him to go and for her to stay , and there were other advantages to it . Because of his Indian training and beliefs , he had a deathly terror of women in their menstrual periods : a dread of being near them , or speaking to them , or even looking at them or having them look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ,  | but it was safer not to risk it . She was glad he had gone . It was odd how he had wavered and hesitated about leaving , as if all his firmness and decision came from following her father 's directions , and as if departing from them threw him into immediate doubt and irresolution , but she was not displeased about that . She was glad he had wavered and hesitated about leaving . THE AFTERNOON WAS BRIGHT AND STILL . SHE LAY QUIET IN THE tent and rested . At sundown she got up , feeling better , and found something to eat . At dark she lit the fire Askwani had laid , spread the tent flap so it could shine in , and went to sleep watching it . An hour before midnight , she came awake to the sound of something heavy being dragged across the ground outside in the dark , and a groaning and choking noise from it like a man in the throes of torment . For a long time she was afraid to look out . She lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or aim it , thinking how useless such a thing was against what was happening outside . When she finally did look out , she saw that it was the old cart-horse . He had dragged himself up from the marsh to be in the firelight . He lay down at the edge of it , his neck and head flat to the ground . Merely the sight of the fire was all he wanted , seemingly . It was as well , since there was nothing else she could give him . About midnight , she went out and put wood on the fire . The horse lay almost out in the dark , without moving . She could n't tell whether he was still alive or not . She came back to bed , but it was hard to sleep , thinking of him . An hour or so past midnight , the prairie-wolves gathered outside the firelight in a half-circle , scuffling , snarling , yelping and fighting among themselves while they waited for the horse to die . The firelight reflected red in their eyes even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into  | a close pack , and let go with the pistol at them . She hit one , but it did no good . The others knocked him down and ate him , and then began shouldering each other into the firelight , hoping to tempt her into shooting another one for them . It was another contingency in which firearms were useless . She reloaded the pistol and built up the fire , and then lay and waited for daylight . There was nothing else to wait for . At daylight the wolves left . They flitted away as silently as shadows cast by the fire . She would have doubted that they had been real , except that the remains of the one they had eaten were left at the edge of the trees . They had taken a bare half-dozen minutes to him , but they had left only the bones . Even they were gnawed and scattered . At some time between dawn and sunrise , the cart-horse died . She was not sure when it happened , but she saw that the legs were drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would have cried over that : the old horse deserved crying over for having been through so much with them , but she ! I held in because most of it would have been merely crying for herself . She drew the tent-flap to keep from seeing him , and lay looking at the roof as the sun reached up on it . She should have eaten , but there was nothing to eat that she wanted . At mid-morning , the painted buzzards came . They were sitting in the trees back of the dead horse when she spread the tent open to let the sun in . They turned their eyes on her , and then went back to watching the horse . She lay down under the covers to drive off the chill they gave her , and then heard one of them flap down to the ground . She got out the pistol and shot toward him , and he flapped back into the trees again . She drove them back to the trees several times during the afternoon . They would go no farther than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clods at them . She did n't use the pistol again , for fear of killing one of them . Having to look at them alive was bad enough . She knew that  | what they had come for would have to happen some time , but the idea of having it happen so close to her , to the place where she had to sleep and eat , sickened her . She knew what it would be like , and she spent the rest of the day driving them off to spare herself the sight of it . At sundown they went away . At nightfall she relaid the fire and lit it , but she hurried at it , not wanting to stay outside with the darkness gathering , and it merely burned up the kindling and went out . She lay for an hour trying to make herself go out and rekindle it , but the wolves came before she could reach the point of doing it , and the unearthliness of their snarling and yelping and rending the dead horse made her afraid to show herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol when they carried their snapping and scuffling too close to the tent . Once she shot , to scare them back . Something outside scared them away completely a little past midnight , but they came back and resumed their work afterward . They stayed with it till daylight . The painted buzzards returned as soon as the sun was up , and kept busy with the horse-carcass till late in the afternoon . Then they left , having polished off everything the wolves had lacked time for . Ruhama stayed in the tent till they were gone , and then went outside . She tried to eat , but gave it up as useless , and set herself to rebuild the fire for the night before going back to bed . The sky was cloudless , and the sun still an hour high , but it darkened and went out as she knelt looking at it . Then there was a rushing sound like a tremendous wind gathering , except that not a breath of wind came . The air remained perfectly motionless , with a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stomach , even though she had eaten nothing . She gave up arranging the fire , and went back in the tent and lay down . The rushing sound kept up till after dark . When it had passed , the wolves came back and fought over what was left  | of the horse . They disappeared again at daylight . The day passed without anything happening that Ruhama was aware of . She experienced a continuous fluttering of alternate blackness and blinding light before her eyes , as if she was looking out through the paddles of a spinning windmill . At evening , the sun blotted out again an hour before its time to set , and there was the same rushing sound following it , with the same stillness in the air and the same unnatural moist warmth . The warmth came in gusts , like something breathing on her . There was a tense feeling about the stillness after it stopped . There were no longer the wolves , since there was nothing left to draw them , but she kept hearing animals moving stealthily past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon was up , and could even see their eyes gleaming in the dark , though after it got daylight she decided that it might have been her imagination , since she was streaky and light-headed from going without food and sleep . She should have eaten , but she could swallow nothing , and the illusion of light and darkness shuttling back and forth before her eyes kept her from going to sleep . Holding her hands tight over her eyes made the illusion fainter , she discovered , though when she drowsed and lightened the pressure it came back as vivid and dazzling as ever . She lay with her palms pressed against her eyeballs to keep it back , measuring the passage of the hours by what she could hear . Loss of sleep exaggerates sounds . A redbird that fluttered down to drink from her water-bucket sounded like the cart being moved over rough ground , and brought her up in a panic for fear of thieves . A little rock-lizard that climbed on the tentroof to hunt flies sounded as if the tent was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees like a deep-voiced woman weeping at the top of her lungs . The rushing sound that came on again toward sundown was like more than a gathering of winds ; it was like water falling from a height , and like a thousand bells tolling and jangling  | against each other . That was clearly her imagination , so she decided to take no notice of sounds . She pressed her hands hard against her eyes to keep back the shuttling lights , and set herself to stand out the night . It was a little past midnight when Askwani came into the tent and found her so . SHE HAD PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE SOUND OF HIS RIDING IN . She had her eyes covered so that no light he struck could reach through to them , so she lay oblivious and rigid when he first looked in at her . He went outside and built up a small fire , and then came back with a lantern , which he set by the head of the bed , and a mug of cassine-leaf tea , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't swallow . It was scalding hot , but she did swallow it , and though it was not quite up to the Creek Indians ' belief in it as good for everything , it did steady her . She explained that she had been sick , omitting particulars , and told him about the dead horse and the wolves and buzzards that had kept her from sleeping and turned her against food . " I 'm better now , anyway , " she concluded . " I ought n't to have let it work on me so , but there 'd been so much scariness back of us , and then the horse dying , and knowing I could n't get away ? I 'll be better when we 're out of here . " " It ai n't an easy place to git out of , " Askwani said . " The road 's worse from here on . The pony like to broke down on the way back . I had to change off and lead him all today , and even then he played out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ai n't much , but I was lucky to find anything . There was a green-corn dance on somewhere down the river , and all the Creeks had gone to it that could . There was n't anybody at home anywhere except a few old squaws . I left the baby with one of ' em , and paid her . She did n't want to take any pay , but I paid her anyway . There was milk-cows around her place , and she looked clean . I told her we 'd be past in
