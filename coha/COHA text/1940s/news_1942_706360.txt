txt CONGRESS PARTY BARS CRIPPS PLAN ON INDIA DEFENSE Negotiations ' Failure Reported to Hinge on Difference Over Control in New Policy ENVOY TO TELL OUTCOME Broadcast Is Set for Today ? Nehru Calls on All Indians to Rally Against Foe By CRAIG TIIONPSON Wireless to Tin NEW Yom Tms . LONDON , April 10 ? Britain 's negotiations ' with India , which have seemed several times on the verge of complete breakdown , only to have hopes revived on the basis of what was reported to be a new formula , now are reported to be a failure . The All-India Congress party capped its long efforts , in which sessions have been almost continuous , by telling Sir Stafford Cripps tonight that the new defense formula was not acceptable . The decision is understood to have been unanimous . Though he appears to have failed , Sir Stafford seems likely to be coming home as a man of no less stature than when he went out . He is regarded officially and publicly as the best man to make the effort to get an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inescapable . An announcement in New Delhi that he will hold -a press conference tomorrow , at which he will tell the outcome of his mission , followed by a radio broadcast to India , probably retelling the same story with his own and his government 's attitude predominant , was received here with considerable interest . Sir Stafford 's broadcast is scheduled by the Blue Network , including station WJZ , for 11 A. M. today . The Associated Press reported that Sir Stafford is expected to leave New Delhi tomorrow . A blast at United States criticism , followed by a strong call today for all Indians to rally behind the fight against aggression , suggests an Indian desire to take on responsibility for the nation 's own actions . As the speeches of the Congress leader , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , seem to suggest , his organization will undertake // CONGRESS PARTY BARS CRIPPS PLAN // every means to unify the nation , while rejecting for the present the British proposals for an " Indian settlement .

" Sir Stafford now is believed to be intent on determining what proportion of the Indian organization is prepared to accept the plan . Until details on the modification of the original plan are fully known , it will be impossible to determine whether Indian opinion has undergone a substantial change in view of the pressure of the Japanese threat . It is apparent , however , that he will not stop immediately with the Congress 's refusal , but will go on to collect the opinions of the Moslem League , the Hindu Mahasabha and probably other organizations , as well as the princes ' chamber . Though carrying out any British proposals seems impossible without the support of the Congress party , Sir Stafford thus will determine the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . Moslems ' Stand Awaited Though the Congress party appeared to have made up its mind , the Moslem League 's attitude still was in a shadowy stage . The main question awaiting an answer is whether the latter organization is willing to associate itself with a national government , at least for the time being . It is yet to appear whether it will withhold adherence to stop-gap provisions while demanding definite provisions for the creation of a Moslem State , which means a division of India and can only be accomplished when threats are past . Mr. Nehru 's statement said : " In this hour of peril for India , many in foreign countries have cabled their expression of earnest desire to come bacX and share in the dangers and perils in defense of the motherland against all aggression and invasion . I am convinced that the duty of every Indian is to do so . Whatever the outcome of the negotiations , the duty of every Indian to serve and defend India to the utntbst remains . " We can not run away and seek safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who lives if India perishes ? India calls and every man and woman must listen to that call . Let each one stick to his post of duty , whatever befalls . " There is going to be no evacuation or running away from duty . There is going to be no evacuation of this dear country of ours or going from one place to another . We shall hold to it until death severs the connection . May we prove worthy of her and the glorious heritage she has handed down to us. "
