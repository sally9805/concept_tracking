GRANDMA , GRANDPA , AND RIVERSIDE ROAD A Story VICTORIA LINCOLN I DO N'T think my parents ever became adjusted , I might even say resigned , to the summer place on Riverside Road . It was , they used to tell each other frequently , and a shade too firmly , a wonderful place for children , with its sheltered estuary for boating and swimming and the square dances at the clubhouse on Saturdays . Their native aptitude for the suburbs , however , was limited , and Riverside Road was Suburbia transplanted , a community of New Haven business men . It was imperative , if I were to run with the pack , that Mother and Father should not appear to breathe a larger or a wilder air . It was sometimes hard . For one thing , Mother loves people , all kinds of people . All kinds , that is , with a freedom from pettiness and a certain joie de vivre . In town , in the wintertime , I never knew who 'd be having tea with her when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some extremely pleasant bishops ) , or it might be an unthinkable panhandler ; but always , it would turn out , it would be someone with a notion , an ideal , a quality , that had caught up her heart . She had a gift , I will say . I do n't think that she ever made a truly mistaken friendship . And it certainly gave color to our life . I remember with particular pleasure old Mr. Ramsbottom , a mad Lancashire ancient who had been , in his day , a powerful agitator in the textile field . Citizen , we had to call him , like something out of A Tale of Two Cities , until he retired to the city home , when he insisted upon being addressed as Pauper Ramsbottom . Sometimes he was a little upset and went about with a red flag on a pole , shouting , " My son 's blood , this color , was spilled in the cause of labor ! " But for the most part , he was as pleasant a fireside guest as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a type to fit in ? on Riverside Road . Nor were many of the others . Mother and Father used to tremble when one of that remarkable entourage would seek them out in their summer haunts . I remember the hot day when Grandma Carpenter came to call . Grandma Carpenter ( like Citizen Ramsbottom , she in-sisted upon her title ) was , in many ways , an unworthy old reprobate . She lived by buying pot-holders cheap and selling them dear , pressing her sales with rich tales of ill-fortune and vows that , despite failing eyesight and trembling fingers , she had taken every stitch herself . She was also , and actually , eligible for the D.A.R. , and she and mother had turned up in conversation two Colonial governors in common ancestry . I do n't know exactly what drew mother to her in the first place , but I suspect it was the joy of the creative artist glowing behind her old eyes as she listened to her own dark unfolding tale of woe . Anyway , we all became very fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as that day was , indeed , perishing hot , I suggested to mother that I take Grandma 's potholders and sell them along the street while she rested in the shade . And after a momentary hesitation , Mother agreed . I was a child with some dramatic ability and , I am afraid , a certain gift for embellishment . The customary salestalk last nothing in my hands . " It 's for Grandma , " I explained up and down the line as I repeated her story with advantages . " Is she living with you now ? " Mrs. White inquired . And I replied , " Oh , no , she lives in a tenement . If she could n't make her holders she does n't know how she 'd keep going . " My sales were phenomenal . Almost everyone bettered even the exorbitant price I asked , and I returned with empty satchel and full purse , radiant with pride . The next day mother noticed many curious glances directed towards our house , and at last one neighbor , less delicate than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was visiting you yesterday , or your husband 's ? " It took a lot of undoing . T HE undoing was hard , too , for I was always a child more loved by her playmates than by their parents . I was n't destructive , or particularly loud , but I was inventive . I could think of more good ways to break your neck than any child you ever knew . My best ideas centered around the railroad station . There are , of course , few satisfactions deeper than that to be had from making doll 's scissors by crossing straight pins in the way of anoncoming locomotive . It takes such exquisite timing . Too early , and the vibration shakes the pins out of place ; too late and you perish . I am happy to report that none of us was ever too late , though it was regularly a near thing . The semaphore , however , was my own private domain . I was a short-winded creature , a dud at softball or prisoners ' base , and it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not run , I could climb , and I had an uncanny sense of balance . The trick was to mount above the ladder , perch on the ledge where the signal arms rose and fell , free both legs and knit a round on a sock ( I was the mainstay of the Red Cross through World War I ) while the express roared through directly below . My feet sweat now at the telling of it . I wonder that my mother did n't run mad . To be sure she said and did plenty , but what punishment could outweigh the exaltation of those moments , balanced against the harsh vibration of the iron pole , feet up , hands going knit two , purl two , as I looked down through steam and smoke upon my worshiping multitude ? Sooner or later , sooner or later , the telephone would ring and the station master would say , " Look-a-here . I 'm sorry to tell you , but your little girl is up the semaphore again . " And , of course , Lizzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . We both had brown pigtails and freckled noses and longed to be mistaken for twins . Who loved one must love both . Grandpa Howland loved us both , and we loved him . The parents of Riverside Road did not think highly of Grandpa Howland . He was a native , an old Civil War veteran , who lived in a farmhouse down near the station . He was so deaf that you had to scream in his ear , which was fun , he loved children with all his soul , and his language was unthinkable . We would come running at the sight of him , to catch his hands and scream , " Hel-/o , Grandpa How-land ! " in a voice to wake the dead ; and he would beam all over his crumpled , leather face and say , " Well , Sissy , well , Lizzie , God damn it to hell , where ye been all day ? Well , be damned if you ai n't the blankin ' blankest cute GRANDMA , GRANDPA , AND RIVERSIDE ROAD 533 little pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come and help me dig clams ? " He was really a dear old man . His profanity had been a guilty attraction at first , but we got so that we hardly noticed it . It was just his way . Every child in the place loved Grandpa Howland . Every child , that is , except his grandnephew who lived with him . Georgie kept right on being shocked . G EORGIE was the only child of Stuffy and Mildred who owned the farmhouse . Stuffy worked in New Haven , going up and down on the commuters ' train , and he and Mildred yearned to be treated like summer people , so I guess Grandpa Howland must have been a thorn in their flesh ; but Lizzie and I were mercilessly agreed that there was no excuse for their not treating him nicer . Them and their airs ! Under the circumstances , the snobbery of the road , I mean , and the distaste of children for individualism , let alone eccentricity , it is hard to understand the hold that Georgie had on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending that he was a duchess . And we not only tolerated him , we let him exert upon us some kind of mass hypnosis . He was a handsome boy of twelve , small for his years , with graceful hands and a high , clear , nervous voice , a queer voice , unchildish , like the voice of a tense young woman . I can still recall it , and see his face , a delicate , sharp-cut face , so lacking in mobility that the wild gray eyes seemed to peek out from the black-fringed eye-holes of a mask . With no further accessory than an old piece of blanketing which he wound about himself for a train , he would set his stage and hold us , a tough and literal little crew for the most part , through an entire morning as helpless as snake-enchanted birds . " Lord . Alvin , my handkerchief ! " And Alvin , a terrible little roughneck , would mutter , " Yes , my Grace . " " Your Grace . " The correction given kindly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the more knowing . Sometimes we would grumble . " Aw , come on , this is n't any fun . Let 's go swimming . Let 's go down to the tracks . " But it never came to anything . " Lady Victoria , my fan ! " " Yes , your Grace . Shall I fan your Grace ? " We did n't like him . We explained him to strangers simply by saying that he was a sissy nut who liked to play he was a duchess . But in the power of his obsession , he was stronger than we . No one could set us free but Grandpa Howland . He would appear in the midst of us , spitting tobacco and rubbing his mouth with his fist . " Well , for Chri ' sake , " he would say , " if tai n't Georgie wound up in that god-dam blanket again . Say , what the bloody hell you doin ' in that thing , anyways ? God damn my soul if I ever do get the right of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what the hell is it ? He ca n't ever speak up so nobody can hear him , nohow . They all go whisperin ' round the house fit to give you the horrors . " " Oh , Uncle Jeffie , " Georgie would cry . " Oh , Uncle Jeffie , do n't swear so . What will people think ? " And he would yank off the blanket with hands that shook , whether from anger or the shock of waking , I do n't know , and run home , leaving us free and our unregenerate selves once more . Oh , yes , we all knew well enough how they felt , Georgie , and Stuffy , and Mildred , on that awful afternoon when Grandpa Howland fell down . Their eyes were downcast , their faces models of pious grief , but Lizzie and I understood them through and through , and even in our grief we were shaken with hatred . We had been squatting beside Grandpa Howland on the wet flats , under the fierce August sun , and scrabbling out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he straightened up abruptly , swayed , made a short , grunting noise and fell forward , his leathery old face yellow and still . We saw them carry him up to the house , his arms and legs dangling . " Go away , " said Stuffy shrilly . " Go away , you horrid , morbid little things . " " Is he dead ? " asked Alvin . He loved Grandpa Howland , but death is pretty exciting , too . Between fear and the awful hope his voice squeaked a little . " Is he dead , Stuf  --  Mr. Stone ? " " No . We 've sent for the doctor . But it looks bad . Bad . " He sighed . " Now , children , go away . Remember , he was . . is . . Mrs. Stone 's uncle , and naturally she is very upset . " The others went , but Lizzie and I could not go . We crept behind an elderberry hedge where we could see the porch and sat huddled together , weeping quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen door , in the back verandah . We could see the toes of the old black boots , the blue of the oid G.A.R. uniform . Lizzie 's swollen , freckled face went over on her brown paws , and her shoulders twitched . There were two near him to mourn , at least . From the kitchen door came the smell of Saturday night supper . Even in my grief I felt a pang of hunger . Grandpa Howland felt it , too . He stirred , he sat up . He gave a deep shout . " Hey ! " said Grandpa Howland . " Why the hell do n't nobody bring me some baked beans and brownbread ! " A faint , silvery squeak came from indoors . " Why , Uncle Jeffie ! " And then higher , shriller , quivering with suppressed anguish , " Mama ! Papa ! Uncle jeffie 's feeling better ! " Shouting , sobbing , hitting each other with our fists , Lizzie and I fell into each other 's arms . Over all the bitterness , the diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever she may be now , and I , she and I , have had one moment of pure victory .
