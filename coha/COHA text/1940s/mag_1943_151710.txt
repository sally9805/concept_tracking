Snooping for Reds in Government jobs , Texas ' unesthetic Representative Martin Dies lumbered smack into esthetic John Bovingdon , 53 , $5,600-a-year economic analyst for the new Office of Economic Warfare . Forgetting both Reds and grammar , earthbound Martin Dies cried : " Bovingdon 's record and career as a ballet dancer is well known . " <P> But cat-graceful John Bovingdon is no ballet dancer ; an uneasy press has generally described him as a religious , rhythmic , or " monodrama " dancer . Harvard-man Bovingdon ( 1915 , magna cum laude ) , the baldest dancer since Harald Kreutzberg , toured Russia and the Orient in the 1920s and ' 30s , wearing a long beard , knickerbockers and sandals . <P> Breath is everything , says Bovingdon , who took up dancing when he was 33 , and ever since has made every motion a dance movement , including shaving , dressing and eating . Said he ( Paris , 1929 ) : " Introduce into an ordinary breath the yawn quality . Let this ' yawmzed breath ' through its natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the ' stylized breath . ' " Once he explained : " We are a band groping toward intuitive communication . . . . When you conceive of a community , all members of which are swayed by kindred emotions of awe and wonder , expressing themselves through plastic bodies moving rhythmically , the picture is staggering . " <P> How John Bovingdon came to be a main economic analyst for OEW no one could quite explain ; he had been recommended by Civil Service and " is doing a good job . " But Martin Dies , hot on this obviously new and subtle subversion , was not to be deterred . He snorted : " If no action is taken by OEW , I will bring the matter to the attention of Congress .
