txt WASHINGTON , July ** fit ' ting and reverential gravity the Senate listened yesterday to the first prayer of its chaplain in the historic chamber to which it has temporarily been driven by architects , carpenters and masons . With the same mien Senators listened to Mr. Connally of Texas as he opened the debate on the North Atlantic Treaty by " invoking the shades of the great men who have served and struggled here . " Then it filled nine pages of the Congressional Record by not so solemnly debating the qualifications of Mrs. Perle . Mesta to be Minister to Luxembourg . " We are vividly conscious this hallowed moment , " said the chaplain , " of invisible galleries filled with a cloud of witnesses from the heroic and creative past . These mellow walls are vocal this hour . They speak to us of towering public servants , of legislators and judges , of momentous debates and decisions , of laws made and interpreted . " Yet possibly the witnesses and the walls never enjoyed anything more than the deluge of vocal breadand-butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lavish hospitality Mrs. Mesta has extended to them . This opportunity was afforded by as solemn and Senatorial a member as ever sat in the famous room to which the Senate has repaired . Mr. Donnell , Republican , of Missouri , is positively Roman in the seriousness of his speech and demeanor . It was he who , reading lengthily from a book by J. Rives Childs on the American foreign service , expressed disbelief that the unofficial hostess of the President , the Administration and anybody else who she thinks rates her dining room has the qualifications which Mr. Childs says a diplomatic agent should have . Not that he lacks " all respect for womanhood , " said Mr. Donnell , neatly eluding a trap which the grinning Senators Lodge and Long set for him . " I know they have rendered fine service . " Not that he doubted the quality and grace of Mrs. Mesta 's entertainments , he assured the many colleagues who stood ready to testify from experience that these could not be doubted , " though I speak only from hearsay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate , for the belief pervades Washington that every Senator has patronized this el  --  agant commissary . ) Mr. Donnell 's trouble , he said , was that he did not know , and the Senate committee had made no direct attempt to determine , whether the lady could perform the important functions of " representation , negotiation , reporting and protection of American interests abroad " which the Childs book asserted an envoy should be able to do . With a dead-pan expression which should make him the most formidable poker-player in Missouri , no mean achievement , Mr. Donnell inquired of Senator , chairman of the Democratic National Committee , if Time Magazine was correct in its report that Mrs. Mesta " is a money raiser extraordinary . " Mr. answered that she could truthfully lay this flattering unction to her soul . While the Missourian was making his case by the Socratic method , however , there were interruptions of which Senator Tobey 's was an admirable example of the , elephantine character of most attempts at lightsome oratory in this body . Inferentially suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an envoy of such vast benevolence , Mr. Tobey exclaimed : If there were fifty million Frenchmen who could become the beneficiaries of her largesse and hospitality , I think I can hear the cry ' that would well up from the hearts of everyone there , who cry out in unison " C'est magnifique ! " This was pretty good from Mr. Donnell 's viewpoint . Obviously all he wanted to do was to stress the personal nature of Mrs. Mesta 's appointment by the President , its relation to her fund-raising for the Democrats in place of the Republicans , to whom she long was thus helpful , and the visceral source of the high praise his colleagues heaped upon her . Mr. Donnell must run next year in a state , by chance the President 's also , where some good campaign material may be made of these things . But he could hardly have hoped for the effect his inquiries had on Mr. Connally , though the reactions of the Senator from Texas are unpredictable . Mr. Connally , defending the wisdom of the appointment , launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign field , who number some of our greatest public servants . The pilgrim from the United States , he said , who visits career envoys invariably discovers that all have a sort of uniform of " striped britches and silk hats , " and at the same point all say : " I have to go . To go . We have tea at four o'clock . I am sorry , but I must go to tea . " Since Mrs. Mesta 's entertaining is prandial , it was clear that Senator Connally never expects her to let her country down that way . Mr. Donnell , having got what he wanted in the record , was the only Senator to vote against a nominee with as many qualifications for her post as a lot of others , a solitude which could not have surprised him . And the " historic chamber " had been re-initiated by a typical Senatorial performance . For , though here were approved the Louisiana Purchase and the treaties that ended the War of 1812 and the Mexican War , here Webster debated with Hayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room has known levity . Vice President Aaron Burr , for instance , often had " to request Senators to be more quiet when they passed the apples and cakes around . " And plums ?
