Fortnight ago the heads of American Airlines faced an embarrassing task-explaining why one of their DC-45 had gone into a violent dive , on a clear , calm day near El Paso , had flown upside down , and dumped 48 fear-stricken passengers* out of their seats . After some consideration they decided not to talk at all . But last week the Civil Aeronautics Board revealed the simple , if startling , truth . The whole thing had been a , witless practical joke . <P> Its perpetrator was the plane 's veteran chief pilot , Captain Charles R. Sisto , of Los Angeles . Captain Sisto was riding as a check pilot while another pilot , Captain John Beck , familiarized himself with the route . As the plane snored west at 8,000 feet , Sisto reached down from a jump seat behind Beck and fastened the gust lock-a device used to lock the rudder , elevator and ailerons while the plane is on the ground . <P> The plane began a steady climb . Puzzled , Pilot Beck adjusted trim tabs on the plane 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still undetected , Sisto released the gust lock . The plane immediately went into an outside loop . Both Sisto and Beck , neither of whom had fastened his safety belt , were thrown from their seats . Two things saved the plane . Sisto struck buttons which feathered the prp-pellors of three engines . Copilot Melvin Logan , who was securely belted in , was able to roll the ship right side up , a bare 300 to 400 feet from the ground . <P> <P> Captain Sisto resigned ( many airmen thought he should have been fired , many others thought he should have been jailed ) . If the plane had crashed , killing passengers and crew , it would doubtless have been added to the list of unexplainable accidents . <P> <P> *A Frenchman , doused with the contents of the plane 's chemical toilet , was apologetically informed : " This is not normal operating procedure in American airplanes.
