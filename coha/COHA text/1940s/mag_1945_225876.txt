The last of the Compton brothers has finally caved in and become an educator . <P> With a pat on the back from his good friend Henry Wallace , big , buoyant Wilson Martindale ( " Doc " ) Compton last December ended his profitable career as a respected Washington , D.C. lumber lobby ist , breezed across the continent to settle in the red brick presidential mansion of Washington State College at Pullman . <P> Last week President Compton was moving into high gear . He named a committee of 40 facultymen to " mobilize the wits , wisdom , and judgment " of the faculty in a thorough review of their program . To Governor Mon C. Wallgren he proposed a whopping $1,750,000 state grant to create new technical and agricultural schools at W.S.C. , shake the whole state out of the lethargy of its " raw-materials economy . " Thus , with characteristic Compton vigor , Wilson Compton , 54 , at last took his place beside his famed brothers Karl and Arthur in the First Family of U.S. education . <P> The Bible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congenital if not hereditary . Karl , Wilson and Arthur were born , in that order , between 1887 and 1892 to Elias Compton , B.A. , M.A. , D.D. , Ph.D. , and Otelia , B.A. , LL.D . ( awarded in 1932 by Western College for Women for " outstanding achievement as wife and mother of Comptons " ) . Mother Compton raised her children on " the Bible and common sense . " <P> All three boys had to earn money to get through Wooster ( Ohio ) College , where their father served for more than 40 years as professor of philosophy , for 22 doubling as dean . No bookworms , all three were multi-lettered sportsmen , good enough to turn pro . But each quickly moved onward &; upward to a Ph.D . <P> In his doctoral thesis , Wilson plotted his idea of the best possible future for the National Lumber Manufacturers Association . It made so much sense that the Association hired him as secretary and manager . While teaching on the side at George Washington University , Wilson served as consultant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While advising Government and industry on the side , Karl and Arthur , became two of the nation 's top physicists . <P> Conserve , Develop , Utilize . In their swift rise , the three filled increasingly bigger jobs in 13 different schools , collected a total of 44 degrees . In 1930 , Karl was named president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology . In 1940 , Nobel Prizewinner Arthur became dean of the University of Chicago 's Division of Physical Sciences . ( In 1913 , their sister Mary married the president of Forman College in Lahore , India . ) <P> Wilson shares the practical Compton philosophy : conserve , develop , utilize . His postwar prospectus : the Northwest will become to Pacific trade even more than New England ever was to Atlantic trade , and W.S.C. will be one of its prime spark plugs . His educational plans are aimed directly at more diversified industry , more jobs , a " scientific spirit " for the State of Washington .                @ @ @ @ @
