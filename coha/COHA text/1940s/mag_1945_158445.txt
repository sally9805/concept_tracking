The neighborhood toughs greeted the new vicar of St. Luke 's Episcopal Chapel with sneering hostility . They tried to frighten him off the sidewalks with raucous taunts about his celibacy . They hooted at the black cassock and big wooden cross he always wore as a member of the Society of Oblates of Mount Calvary . They sneaked into the parish house when his back was turned and smashed up the furniture . But tall , handsome Reverend Edward Henry Schlueter ( rhymes with Peter ) kept his stubborn smile and quietly got on with the job : bringing back to life his broken-down appendage of Manhattan 's rich Trinity Church . <P> Convinced that a parish is made of people , rather than of bricks , Father Schlueter always opened St. Luke 's door with an equal welcome - for the dirtiest urchin , the haughtiest dowager , the most troubled atheist . He turned his big Connecticut farm into a camp for poor children , and the neighborhood toughs , beginning to suspect their own toughness , went off and spent whole summers there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knack for easing people 's troubles . <P> Last week , with 35 years and three months of work behind him , Father Schlueter retired from St. Luke 's . Now white-haired and plump , he said that his age ( 67 ) and poor health had taken him into " the golden evening " of his life . He wanted to devote that evening to preaching missions and conducting retreats . <P> To some , it might have seemed that there was little tangible evidence that he had ever been at St. Luke 's at all . There was nothing much to prove it : just a new gymnasium and a handful of fruit trees he himself had planted ( last year 's crop : two apples , twelve cherries ) . But St. Luke 's parishioners , if no one else , knew what Father Schlueter had done : that he had lived among them as a simple man of God .
