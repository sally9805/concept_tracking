Now that the fighting in Germany is over and some of our overseas servicemen are coming home , I think you would be particularly interested in seeing a new film called The Returning Veteran which the MARCH OF TIME is releasing this month to more than 10,000 theaters across the country . We like to think that MARCH OF TIME films like this add a new dimension of action to much of the news you read in TIME itself . For MOT 's purpose is to do in motion pictures what TIME tries to do for you in words : tell you the news as history in the making . It was just ten years ago this spring that MOT released its first picture-and only 417 theaters in the whole United States were willing to take a chance on showing such a revolutionary new kind of film . But H. G. <P> Wells called it " a brilliantly successful attempt to put real news into the newsreel " - David Selznick recognized it as " the most significant development since the invention of sound " - and just two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar " for " revolutionizing the newsreel . " The MARCH OF TIME has been developing constantly since those early films , and today it requires a staff of close to 100 specially-trained technicians . Head man is Producer Richard de Rochemont , who headed its operations in Europe for nine years and covered the early battles of the war firsthand for TIME &; LIFE . His seven camera crews have been to the ends of the earth to record the great and the near-great of our times , and their adventures would fill a column many times the length of this one . Today the MARCH OF TIME produces La Marcha del Tiempo in Spanish and Portuguese for Latin America and La M ar che dti Temps in French for Belgium , France and the French Empire . It plays regularly in Canada , Britain , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , Iceland , India ( 300 theaters ) and Egypt ( with subtitles in native languages ) . And here at home it is seen every month by an audience of 30,000,000 . <P> Recently MOT has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for study and discussion in the nation 's clubs and classrooms . ( In three months more than 1,700 schools subscribed for a year of these films . ) And one of its regular releases was shown in war plants all over the country to build the morale of industrial workers . ( Said the Aero Products Division of General Motors after showing this film : " Absenteeism took a sharp decline sharp decline - and has never gone back to the old figures . " ) In its early days MOT touched on as many as six topics in a single film : Vol . I , No. i ranged from a speakeasy in Manhattan to the crisis in Japan to the first motion pictures ever taken of a performance at the Metropolitan Opera . <P> But now the MARCH OF TIME , passing its tenth anniversary , enters its second decade ready to dig far deeper into far more complex subjects and to handle each issue as one complete story with beginning , middle , end-a story which will show not only what happened but also why it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent releases I hope you have had a chance to see are The West Coast Question-Postwar Farms-Inside China Today - Postwar Jobs-and Report On Italy , with its terrifying scenes of the vengeance the Italian people wreaked on their betrayers.
