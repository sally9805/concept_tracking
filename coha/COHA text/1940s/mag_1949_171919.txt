For the past ten years , a slim , long-faced cockney girl with big blue eyes and a big blue voice has been the queen of England 's popular singers . By last week , Vera Lynn 's voice was being heard across the U.S. - and if she was n't yet the queen of U.S. singers , she was at least high on the list of ladies in waiting . <P> When her recording ( London Records ) of You Ca n't Be True , Dear first hit the U.S. last May , thousands of fans bought the platter and listened . Here , for a change , was a girl who really sang , straight out and straight on the beat , instead of cooing mushily and straying away from the band . Last month , her warmly sung Again crept into Variety as a comer on the coin machines . By last week , Vera and Again seemed headed straight for the hit parade . <P> Born in London 's poor East Ham district , the daughter of a plumber , Vera knew five songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was three . At seven , she was singing , in frills and bows , for Masonic dinners and charity benefits . " A straight-faced kid , could n't get her to smile , " says her dressmaker-mother , who always went along . At school , " they thought I had a terrible voice , " says Vera , " but they always put me up in front because I opened my mouth so nice and wide . " <P> At eleven , she joined the " Kracker Kids Kabaret " and won a small reputation as a juvenile torch singer . Then , at 14 , her voice broke during an attack of laryngitis ; it came out , says Vera , " slightly lower and not so noisy . " <P> Britain at large first got an earful of <P> Vera 's singing when she began broadcasting with Ambrose and His Orchestra in 1937 . But she really won her queen 's crown during the war with a program for the troops called Sincerely Yours . So many of them heard her telling Private Bill Jones his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , that standard questions of returning British troops were 1 ) " What 's left of London ? " and 2 ) " Is Vera still alive ? " <P> At 32 , Vera is not much interested , she says , in coming to New York ( " too much of a headache " ) . She would rather be with her husband Harry and three-year-old daughter Virginia at home in Regent 's Park , where she still does most of the housework- " anything with my hands , and not much with my brain . " Vera 's explanation of her success : " I suppose I 'm the girl in the street , singing to the man in the street . "
