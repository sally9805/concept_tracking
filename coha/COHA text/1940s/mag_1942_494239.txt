The Poet and the War WHAT Is the writer 's job in this war ? What is the poet 's job ? These are questions that need asking , not because they have never been answered , but because they have been answered so glibly . Years ago , when Yeats was asked for a war poem , he wrote : I think it better that in times like these A poet 's mouth be silent , for in truth ? We have no gift to set a statesman right ; He has had enough of meddling who can please A young girl in the indolence of her youth , Or an old man upon a winter 's night . In these later times , when the magnitude of the world 's wry can find no image , the poet may well be silent . Lle can say nothing adequate to the catastrophe in LWhich mankind is caught . And the more intimately he lows the problems that we must solve or perish , the more apt he is to stammer or turn mute . And yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people more than his ters ? 21a1 memories , his private fears : he wants to make them aware of the history that is written in their lives 4111 his own . He is concerned to keep fresh the meaning of Spain and of Munich and of the war that was fought under the same slogans with which our ears ache now . Remembering Pearl Harbor , he remembers the American oil magnates who helped to fuel the Japanese planes . Heartened by the heroic achievement of the Red Army , he asks that the murder of the leader who created that magnificent fighting force be not forgotten . He wants to press home the lynchings in Mississippi , the shootings in Delhi , the commonplace cruelties and inequities of daily living that stain the Atlantic Charter and cast a long shadow across the Four Freedoms . He looks for the beginnings , however small , of the good society for which men are working , fighting and dying . And he asks again if the man who works with words , and who does not wear the peculiar glory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mortification comes in part from the feeling he shares with Auden that language may be useless , for No words men write can stop the war Or measure up to the relief Of its immeasurable grief . 742 It comes also from the knowledge that he is forced to use damaged tools . Language has recently been debased , along with every other human attribute , as never before . It is not alone the dictators and the demagogues who have prostituted it . The creative writer must reckon equally with the advertisers , the public-relations counselors , the hacks who provide material for the pulps and the facile slicks , the composers of run-of-the-mill radio and movie scripts . The verbal valets of the established order , the literary strong-arm squad protecting business-as-usual , stand between the poet and the common man . The poet has , of course , seldom been close to the people . Whitman chummed with laborers and roughs , but they knew little or nothing of his poetry . The trouble is that words Are a ' but useless noo To span the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complains . Yet from Piers the Plowman down to the Scottish Communist , there have always been poets who understood that , however personal their vision , however private their speech , these took on meaning only in a social context . The implication is not that the great poets accept or propagate a particular political or economic program . But since they speak out of the depths of the self , they address themselves inevitably to the heart of the common man . And so what they produce must work , with slowness certainly and indirection , yet work upon the emotions and the understanding of the general . It is the unhappy sense of the gulf between the human and highbrow view that today intensifies the poet 's feeling for his craft . If the debasement of language hampers him as never before , it also , as never before , acts as a challenge . He is engaged in a double struggle , against the avowed fascists and against those who intentionally if disguisedly or who out of ignorance uphold the dead past . He must therefore use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the scientist seeks to exalt life , the poet asks only to give the quality of it . But in so doing he shares the task of the scientist , and if he can not " justifie the wayes of God to man , " he can at least realize some fragment of experience and place it within the framework of an imaginative order . He has one task , one desire : to discover and explore reality , and to communicate it in all its disturbing complexity as intelligibly as he may . This is not , evidently , the view of the Writers ' War Board . The Board was created at the instance of the Treasury Department in need of bond salesmen . Its president is a composer of popular detective stories who , for all his skill , does not seem to have discovered the body . That corpse is the sort of poetry that lies unburied in Miss Millay 's " The Murder of Lidice . " Under ordinary circumstances the publication of shoddy verse by a poet who is usually more than coin- THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that shabby workmanship is expended on a theme of grave import and put forth with the imprimatur of a semiofficial group , the literary issue becomes a public one . Miss Millay is to be excused if the horror of the theme she was requested to treat proved so overwhelming that she could not handle it . But she is not to be excused for having published her helplessness . Above all , the Writers ' War Board is not to be excused for accepting and promoting a piece that can be read only with embarrassment . The imagery with which the poem opens is as inept as the syntax . It is surpassed , however , by a metaphor toward the close where Hitler is represented as running wild and at the same time sitting still , with his long and cruel thumbs Eating pastries , molding the crumbs Into bullets . On the third page the Teller of the Tale plunges into a mawkish ballad about the building of Lidice , but this is easier to swallow than the passage which follows : Oh , dear , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sight to see ! And how is a busy mother to know Up to what her daughter may be ? Yet here by the stove I must stir the pot , Yes , here I must stand and bide , While the handsomest girl in the country-side Is up to what and up to what-not ! The perplexed reader ends by wondering how he can stand and bide while a woman who not long ago Was one of the handsomest poets in the countryside is up to what and up to what-not . Nor is this the only instance of lines that read like a schoolgirl 's translation of second-rate verse . Miss Millay shouts where she should whisper , burbles where she should speak . She treats on the level of cheap melodrama an incident that is dramatic and terrible . enough if related in the simplest factual terms , and decorates it with conventional , outworn details . The conclusion of this verse-narrative which is to commemorate the brutal extinction of an entire village is a jingle with a refrain that could be . sung equally well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Jinks . " It is possible , if doubtful , that a poet possessed a more mature understanding , exercising a greater technical skill and having a more sensitive re ea for or his integrity , would yet fail to make the story of Lidice into a memorable poem . The fact remains that $ tragedy with revolutionary implications is here reduced to a hasty piece of propaganda , jejune in conception ' childish in execution and enervating in its effects . It may be objected that such writing is directed not at other poets , not at literary critics , not even at , the subscribers to the liberal weeklies , but at the 001 ? 1 ? 11 reader . If so , then the fault is the more egregious . For while the common reader is " uncorrupted , " in Dr. DECEMBER 71 1942 Johnson 's phrase , " by literary prejudices , " he is all too corruptible by literary malversation . Bad writing is more than an esthetic offense . It is bad not only intrinsically , as ill baked bread or ill woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked bread may hurt the child who eats it and ill woven cloth may cripple the parachute-jumper who relies on it ? such writing is evil in its effects . It is the expression of false feeling and false thinking , and it makes for imperfect sympathies and mistaken judgments . The common reader is not served by sentimental vapc-ings or facile bombast . Nor does it seem likely that he will be roused to the desired ends if he is prodded to them by ill chosen means . Granted that a short " dramatic verse-narrative " dealing with one incident in the war can not take account of the Whole tragic complex , were the poet able to grasp it . But to reduce the story to these quaint proportions is to oversimplify it so as to obliterate the truth . The truth is not easy to come at . Certainly the poets in the last war were slow in discovering it . But it is Worth while recalling again what one of them said in the fragmentary notes he left when he was killed in action : " Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not concerned with Poetry . The subject of it is War . And the pity of War . The poetry is in the pity . All the poet can do today is to warn . That is why the true Poets must be truthful . " That has been their function always . It is peculiarly their function today , when Mankind is engaged in a revolutionary war . Some misguided revolutionists are fighting on the wrong sides not a few enlightened ones are combating the attitude of their own astigmatic , reactionary or power-intoxicated leaders . But one fact can not be overemphasized . Because of the significance of this revolution , and the fogginess in which it is being fought , " the true Poets must be truthful . " This may mean that they can not write about the War . They may be too deeply involved in it to be able to do so . Here is the crux of the difference between the Journalist and the creative writer . The journalist must deal with immediate things , with the events in Lidice ' 18 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chelmno . He can not wait until he knows how to assess what he has heard and seen , or how to present it most memorably . He is called upon to speak /t4t a witness , and he must do so promptly , briefly and honestly . The creative writer too has the duty of a It ru tness to tell the truth . He has , however , a further duty Even if he is not required to bring in a verdict , la e has to reflect upon the truth , which may not be 8 : ' nee or simple or immediately apparent . So that he tak es on something of the character of a member of the t1.7 . And to a certain extent he is a judge as well . Like the judge , he must " regulate the trial and pass on mat-ter ! , of law , " that is , he must , as an artist , make deci-II " and interpretations that lie beyond the scope of *Ian on the witness-stand or in the jury box . 743 Whether his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to his work all his powers of understanding , of imagination , of craftsmanship . More fortunate than the journalist , he has leisure to deepen his understanding and to cultivate his craftsmanship . Nor will anyone quarrel with a poet for exercising his imagination . In any case , it is not incumbent on him to speak when he has nothing tp say or when he is so pained or puzzled that he must speak inadequately . Hemingway wrote recently that the only true writing that came through during the last war was in poetry , because " poets are not arrested as quickly as prose writers would be if they wrote critically , since the latter 's meaning , if they are good writers , is too uncomfortably clear . " It is something other than the subtlety and ambiguity of much good poetry that keeps poets out of jail . Hemingway failed to take account of the fact that the period of gestation may be longer for a poem than for a piece of prose , and so , though the poet may be a more violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily become articulate . Some eighteen years elapsed between Milton 's projection of " Paradise Lost " and the writing of those lines in which Lucifer is given the heroic stature of the arch-rebel : What though the field be lost ? All is not lost ; the unconquerable Will , And study of revenge , immortal hate , And courage never to submit or yield : And what is else not to be overcome ? There is no doubt , however , that few good poems are " uncomfortably clear " at first reading . For poetry is the most comprehdraive expression possible to the mind that is most aware . Perhaps never in the history of mankind has it been so difficult for the poet to exercise his function . The agony , the evil , that surround and invade him are inexpressible . He may hold his tongue . He may speak only of personal experiences , as Stephen Spender in his recent lyrics , and so deal with the " weakness , fantasy and illusion " that are part of the personal life . He may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of poems , to write convincingly and movingly of the dark forces without and within . But he can not lend himself to propaganda . It is not merely that if he uses words in a servile way he degrades himself and his fellows . He dare not take the risk of misleading the common reader , of betraying the common man . And he takes that risk as soon as he begins writing to order , instead of writing out of the depths of his own awareness . Poets are not , as Shelley claimed , the unacknowledged legislators of the world . But because they can imagine a different , less wretched world , there are among them many soldiers of the revolution . Let them look to their weapons .
