txt This is still the little man 's convention  --  the individual , unbossed delegates  --  and it is impossible to forecast its outcome . In many ways this uncertainty is an excellent sign of the healthy operation of democracy within the Republican Party . And yet the long-range outlook is none too reassuring . Here is the situation as it appears in Philadelphia today : Thomas E. Dewey and Robert A. Taft still have the largest delegate support , at least for the first few ballots . In all probability Mr. Dewey will be ahead by some 50 votes on the first ballot , with a total of somewhere between 300 and 400 ( you see by this range that we are a cautious guesser ) . Mr. Taft should , therefore , have between 250 and 350 . Willkie 's Place on First Ballot Wendell L. Wilkie may well not be in third place , but may trail Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg , Gov . Arthur H. James of Pennsylvania , and possibly Frank Gannett and Senator Styles Bridges . This is all on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers to disintegrate rapidly . Mr. Wilikie has potential supporters in nearly every delegation , and ivill pick up strength all over the map , or so it is assumed . But his votes are rather " iffy , " rather speculative , they are far from assured . For two days now , there has been talk of a Taft-Dewey combination to stop Mr. Willkie . Obviously both of them can not be nominated for President . Obviously by combining they have enough votes to effect a nomination on the first ballot  --  if they can control them . And almost equally obviously , neither Senator Taft nor Mr. Dewey is going to concede the first place on the ticket to the other without a test of strength in the actual voting . Dewey Is Confident Mr. Dewey is confident and unshaken . He will not be eager to take the Vice-Presidential place . Indeed , he has assured friends that he " can not afford financially " to di ) so . Probably holding lead position in the initial ballot , why should he make a deal to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as confident , particularly in the stability of his nucleus strength and the political expertness of his management . He feels that Mr. Dewey is slipping , and that he  --  Senator Taft  --  is the only major candidate who has not aroused serious animosities , which is a real asset . So why should he concede the first place in advance ? Under these circumstances , though doubtless intermediaries from the Taft and Dewey camps have made contact with one another , there can hardly be a workable deal until after , the balloting begins . And it may then 13p too late . For the problem will be for , either Senator Taft or Mr. Dewey to " deliver " his votes to the other . It is almost universally agreed that the Dewey delegates will be the first to take flight . Will they go to Senator Taft or to Mr. Willkie ? Plenty of them are frank to state to reporters that they will go to Mr. Wilikie . An Unbossed Convention For , remember , this is the unbossed convention . Delegates can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mark Hanna or Boise Penrose manner . They listen to siren songs  --  the songs of those who say : " Do n't follow the bosses . The public is fed up with them . Vote independently . Are you mice or men ? " All the same , unless Senator Taft is too far behind on the first ballot , he is expected to gain a number of Dewey votes on the second . Enough , perhaps , even for a nomination then ) or on the third ballot . Meantime , drives of the Old Guard leaders against Mr. Wilikie are in full swing , while he and his helpers seek to capture the rank and file . Yesterday a group of Congressmen , estimated to be as many as 100 , but probably far less , issued a manifesto saying that his " views and public statements are such that he can not run effectively on a platform in harmony with the Republican record in Congress . " Rank . and File View These attacks crystallize the leadership resistance to Mr. Willkie . But they may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary delegates know that the people do not want a " boss-picked " candidate , and that if enthusiasm for Mr. Wilikie is as real as it appears to be , they had better look out for a serious reaction if they ignore it . Nevertheless , the leaders hate to take Mr. Willkie . Their viewpoint is that of party workers who have toiled in the heat and burden of the day only to have an erstwhile Democrat come along and take the cake . Some among them take issue with his sympathy with Roosevelt foreign policy , and this is particularly true in isolationist areas beginning notably ' in Wisconsin . , But while the Old Guard attacks continue they of the Young Guard are getting on what they hope will be a bandwagon . Gov . Ralph L. Carr , vigorous new executive of Colorado , today indorsed Mr. Willkie and is to be his floor leader  --  an excellent choice . And , as one final truism , it is certainly anybody 's choice . Either the Wilikie candidacy will be , a whirlwind , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest flashes in the pan in recent party history . Nobody can yet tell which , however confident they may be in the forecaster 's credentials . Erwin D. Canham -
