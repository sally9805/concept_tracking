It was believed in official quarters that Sir Stafford 's change of plans indicated his belief that 1 there was still a chance of accomplishing his mission . The All-India radio , as heard in London early today , said that " official circles in New Delhi firmly believe that difficulties among members of the Congress party can be settled , and , however difficult the situation may appear , a settlement without question will be found , " The United Press reported .

It is London 's belief that , if anybody in the government now can reach an agreement wit4 India , Sir // MAINPARTYININDIA IS CRITICAL OF PLAN // Stafford is the man , and that if he fails it probably means closing of the door on Indian independence for a long time . He is regarded ' as an especially good pleader , a convincing talker and a firstrate debater . Those qualities , coupled with genuine sympathy for the Indians , are held likely to bring success to him or , at least , to put him as near it as can be attained at the present time .

" Replies to Questions Before announcing his change of plans , Sir Stafford had been scheduled to begin his return journey Monday . The Congress reaction to the British proposals was not made public at New Delhi , but there were reports  --  which seemed reasonably accurate  --  that it was particularly critical of proposals regarding de .. fense and the option given the provinces to stay out of a future Indian union if they so desired , as well as of the method of representation of Indian States in the constitution-making body . The lastnamed had been carefully framed in an effort to provide for representation of minorities so lesser groups could have a voice in framing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained . It is the knotty problem of defense that is raising the most trouble . It was learned at New Delhi today that Sir Stafford , seeking to provide expert enlightenment for the Congress on that score , had arranged a meeting between General Sir Archibald P. Waxen , British Commander in Chief in India , and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad , president of the Congress party . Military problems involved would thus be made plain to the Indians . It is considered barely possible that this may effect some change of attitude but not much hope is held . Hopes for More Meetings It was understood that the Congress criticism was written by Mohandas K. Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru . Pandit Nehru and Mr. Azad delivered it to Sir Stafford . Sir Stafford was asked later whether he would be seeing them again . He replied : " I hope there will be many more meetings between friends . " Although the Congress working committee has been in session nearly continuously since the beginning of the week , there has been only one meeting of the working committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mohammed Ali Jinnah , president of the Moslem League , has seen Sir Stafford several times since , but as yet there is no indication of what the Moslem League 's attitude is . Meanwhile , it is apparent that great service of the mediator 's sort is being performed by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mukund . Ranirao Jayakar , two liberal leaders . Sir Tej is held in high esteem by all groups and he appears to be making strong efforts to help toward an agreement .
