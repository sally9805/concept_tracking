As an investment , a band is like a Broadway show . If it pays , it pays off handsomely . Exactly one year ago a prosperous Manhattan song publisher invested in a 4-F music-arranger . <P> Last week slim , dark-haired George Paxton , 30 , joined the glossy fraternity of " name-band " ' leaders . Simultaneously , Paxton 's financial backer began to look forward to dividends on a $35,000 investment . All in a breathless few days the young man who was unknown as a bandleader a year ago : 1 ) got the Glenn Miller trophy for the best new band of the year ; 2 ) signed with Columbia Pictures ; 3 ) added the Los Angeles Palladium Ballroom to bookings at Manhattan 's coveted Paramount Theater and Pennsylvania Hotel . <P> What happened to George Paxton has become the accepted formula for success as a name-band leader . First , there must be an " angel " who can be persuaded that the leader will click . Then there are hard months of rehearsing and harder months of trying out around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a big radio network hookup . <P> All told , the buildup seldom costs less than $40,000 ( Glenn Miller needed $60,000 ; Artie Shaw $65,000 ) . During the costly prestige-building months , the weekly take is small . But once the film , radio and record contracts start rolling in , the reckoning is in five figures . <P> From the start , serious , levelheaded Paxton was a sound investment . The son of two lieutenant colonels in the Salvation Army , he learned early to blow a variety of horns in soul-saving bands . He spent ten years as a name-band arranger . During the past year , he has worked some 17 hours a day rehearsing , scurrying after contracts , exploring songs . He is not wide-eyed about success : " It 's harder to stay there than to get there . "
