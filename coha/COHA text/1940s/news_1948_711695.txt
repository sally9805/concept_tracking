txt New York is being flooded with the greatest amount of counterfeit money in the history of the country . This warning was sounded yesterday by officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Secret Service . The counterfeit bills , in denominations of $10 and $20 , are so perfect that Re serve officials described them as " dangerous . " The bogus money was first detected a week ago and has since poured daily into the Federal Reserve Bank in such increasing proportions that the bank officials together with Treasury agents called an unprecedented press conference to warn of the danger . On the basis of the bogus money already detected , it was estimated that the amount ' in the hands of the public ' might run into " millions of dollars , " far outstripping the exploits Of " Count " Victor Lustig , whose gang in 1934 flooded the Midwest with $2.500,000 in counterfeit currency . So far the New York area has been the main dumping ground for the new counterfeit bills , described by Treasury agents as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , " G " in the left-hand ring on the face of the bill . This " G " indicates ordinarily the issuance ? of the paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago , whereas the currency issued by the New York Federal Reserve Bank carries the letter " B. " Those from the central bank in Boston are designated by the letter " A , " Philadelphia by " C , " etc. , from the various issuing Reserve banks throughout the country . It was the phenomenal supply of $10 and ' $20 bills with the letter " G " coming from banks in the Second ( New York ) Federal Reserve District to the central bank in Wall Street that first attracted // the attention of a woman clerk in the bank 's headquarters here . Bills issued by banks outside the New York district are immediately returned to the ? original issuing institution . An expert examination of the bills soon established them as false currency . The $10 counterfeit is printed on one sheet of heavy paper similar to that used for the $20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks have been used to simulate the genuine fibre . In the Hamilton portrait , the engraving of which is superior to that in the average bogus bill , a heavy black line marks the bridge of the nose , and a tiny white speck mars the otherwise well-executed cross-ruled background . The speck is opposite Hamilton 's lower lip and about one-sixteenth of an inch from the outer edge of the oval . Diagonal White Streak A diagonal white streak , which appears to be a plate defect , intersects the hairline border and mars the lathework at a point about seven-eighths of an inch from the top right corner of the note face . In .. the Treasury seal , magnification reveals that a green dot immediately under the center of the arm of the balance scales blends with the arm whereas it should be separate . Also , the left end of the right-hand suspended scale pan extends beyond the point where the left chain touches the pan . In the genuine , the pan ends where it touches the chain . The serial numbers are thicker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slightly smaller than the numerals . The back of the note is much darker than the genuine $10 bill but is very well executed . The bogus notes also may be detected by the following printed description supplied by the Secret Service : On the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago , Ill. ; Series of 1934C ; check letter " L " , face plate No. 108 or 430 , Serial No. ** check letter " K " , face plate No. 430 , Serial No. ** check letter " G " , face plate No. 110 , Serial No . G2020964713 ; facsimile signatures of W. A. Julian , Treasurer of the United States , and John W. Snyder , Secretary of the Treasury ; back plate No. 1201 . The $20 counterfeit is a deceptive production printed on one sheet of good quality paper but heavier than the genuine . Here also faint red crayon marks have been utilized to simulate the genuine fiber . The Jackson portrait is described by Secret Service officials as especially well executed , although the face generally lacks the impression of depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterfeit shows the same defects as the $10 bill , with the serial numbers thicker than the genuine and the prefix letter " G " sufficiently defective to be mistaken for a " C " at first glance . A defect in the small letter " t " in the title " Secretary of the Treasury " makes it appear that the crossbar is omitted , and the letters " ry " in " Secretary " are joined together . In " Treasury " there is a tiny black dot just above the first downstroke in the letter " u . " The back of the $20 note , like the bogus $10 , is printed in a green much darker than that used for genuine currency . $20 Counterfeit Described The Secret Service describes the $20 counterfeit as follows : " On the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago , Ill. , Series of 1934C ; check letter " G , " face plate No. 110 , Serial No. ** check letter " I , " face plate No. 110 , Serial No. ** check letter " L , " face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate No. 480 ; facsimile signature of W. A. Julian , Treasurer of the United States , and John W. Snyder , Secretary of the Treasury .
