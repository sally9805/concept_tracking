txt " Kick - back " ? fast - growing younger brother of the " black market " in food supplies , is a racket which  --  wherever ilstrikes today ? is reported to be wiping out much of the decency in the food business . And it is costing those Massachusetts retailers who are struggling to survive a minimum of $2,500,000 a year in tribute . There 's hope , however , in the fact that the F. B. I. already has cracked down on some of the tough cases . But it was getting'so that an honest buyer could n't go into the market for his meat supplies without liquor , cigars , cigarettes , cash in envelopes , or some other form of tribute to hand over to the salesm4n at his supply house , according to Malcolm McCabe , Secretary of the Massachusetts Retail Grocers ' and Provision Dealers ' Association . But , today , a bottle of liquor or a couple of cartons of cigarettes , is just " small peanuts , " he added . " However , based on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the cost of a single bottle of liquor or two cartons of cigarettes  --  one ' tip ' to a salesman , it costs our grocers here in Massachusetts , alone , $50,000 a week extra tribute just to get supplies , " he stated in a special bulletin to the members of his Association . And then he added , significantly to the grocers to whom he is appealing in an effort to smash this racket , " Did I say four bucks a week ? You fill in your own figure . " An indication that he 's based his estimate on the " kick-back " at an extremely low minimum . Apparently , it 's a clear case of contamination breeding greed . For once a salesman becomes contaminated he soon becomes greedy , and , if one buyer is good for $10 , the grocer who draws the line at $5 is just out of the picture . Such a thing as " employee honesty " is a question today say some executives who hesitate to fire the racketeers , because they " know too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get , " said one larger retailer today . " I frankly do n't know what the answer is to the situation . We 're just dealing with a lot of men who never before have been in the driver 's seat , and they are holding the whip hand , ridiculing things that are honest or decent . " Go down through the market any day , " he added . " The whole set-up is rotten . The smaller fellows are paying the smaller salesmen , and the bigger buyers are kicking back to the top suppliers . The racket even extends down the line to the big packers . If you want to buy a thousand pounds of pork , for instance , you 'll have to take 10,000 pounds of neck bones . " It 's the same old story of the hundred-eared pigs . To get a couple of boxes of hams you 've got to take a barrel or two of pigs ' ears . Many times I 've been asked to take the stuff . I tell them I ca n't use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to haul it to my store and then away for dumping , so I tell them to bill me and throw it away themselves . " Fear of retaliation , apparently , is staying the grocer 's fighting arm , although Mr. McCabe strongly urges the smashing of this racket in every practical way . " Do n't be a willing victim , " he warns . " Do n't make it easy for the fellow who 's putting the shake on you by an attitude of indiffer ence or an apparent willingness to take all the junk they try to push en you . The temporary advantages gained now soon turn sour when you see how much they cost , " he adds . Afraid to Kick However , many retailers are afraid to complain to executives of meat companies . They have no way of telling whether items which they have ordered  --  and do not get because some unscrupulous truck driver has side-tracked them to some of his friends for a few extra dollars  --  were short-shipped or lifted en route . " The F. B. I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McCabe , " but it is essential that top managers make spot checks at regular intervals to prevent such shifting of supplies . " In all fairness , it must be stated that some dealers are conducting their businesses along strictly honest lines . Criticized and ridiculed by those whose greed has gotten the better of them , these honest wholesalers retort that " this war ca n't last forever . We may be suffering , but at least we are surviving without dealing in the ' black market ' or engaging in ' kick backs . ' "
