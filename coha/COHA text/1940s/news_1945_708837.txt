txt When radioactivity was discovered and physicists first began to dream of atomic energy the late Sir Oliver Lodge was moved to write that " if ever the human race gets hold of a means of tapping even a small fraction of the energy contained in the atoms of their own planet the consequences will be beneficent or destructive , according to the state of civilization . " He doubted if mankind of his generation was civilized enough to use such a discovery rationally . What was once a mere fantasy to him is now a reality . The bomb which has wrought such havoc on the Japanese Army base of Hiroshima and which , weight for weight , is 2,000 times more destructive than any explosive previously compounded is undoubtedly the most stupendous military and scientific achievement of our time . It may even be the most stupendous ever made in the history of science and technology . A Jules Verne or an H. G. Wells could hardly overstate what we must now contemplate in war and peace . No invention ever given to man has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the prospect either of destruction on a scale which dwarfs anything thus far reported and which awakens justified fears of what may happen in another war or of a golden era of social change which would satisfy the most romantic utopian . University professors who are opposed to organizing , planning and directing research after the manner of industrial laboratories because in their opinion fundamental research is based on " curiosity " and because great scientific minds must be left to themselves have something to think about . A most important piece of research was conducted on behalf of the Army by precisely the means adopted in industrial laboratories . And the result ? An invention is given to the world in three years which it would have taken perhaps half a century to develop if we had to rely on prima donna research scientists who work alone . The internal logical necessities of atomic physics and the war led to the bomb . A problem was stated . It was solved by team work , by . planning , by competent direction and not by a mere desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world by surprise , this new atomic bomb is the natural evolution of discoveries which began with radioactivity and which reached a critical stage in 1939 . In that year two German physicists , Drs. 0 . Hahn and E. Strassmann , bombarded uranium with neutrons , which , as the name indicates , are electrically neutral . Every atom is held together by particles which attract each other because some are electrically positive and some negative . To distintegrate the nucleus of an atom and lay bare its structure is one of the most baffling tasks in physics  --  baffling because bombarding particles are usually captured when they are hurled against the powerful electrical barriers within matter . But the neutron can slip through and reach the target . Hahn and Strassmann found that when uranium is bombarded with neutrons it is split in two with a tremendous release of energy . Their work was speedily confirmed in this country . The wonder was that a pile of uranium ore did not explode spontaneously . It was suspected that one of three forms of uranium known respectively as 2344 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were involved . The suspicion was verified . Uranium 235 proved to be the form of isotope of uranium that gave the spectacular results described by Hahn and Strassmann . There is every reason to believe that U-235 is the substance that has made the bomb unleashed against Japan so terrible . The important facts about the three forms or isotopes of uranium were so well known before the war that there was even much speculation on the military possibilities of U-235 . Since both Hahn and Strassmann were German , the Hitler Government was not far behind us in developing the atomic bomb . Indeed , the reports from Washington indicate as much . * * * A scientific principle is one thing , application in practice is another . The problem was presented of separating U-235 from the associated 238 and 234 . A ton of commercial uranium ore contains about fourteen pounds of U-235 , which explains why a pile of uranium ore does not explode spontaneously . How is this small quantity of U-235 to be separated ? The Germans again were in the forefront . Drs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms or isotopes of krypton , a rare gas in the air we breathe , can be separated in tall concentric cylinders . The process was slow . Even improvements made by Prof. Wilhelm Krasny-Ergen of Stockholm did not yield more than 1.3 milligrams in twenty-four hours , so that three years would have been required to collect a single gram , or onethirtieth of an ounce . More promising is the method of whirling out U-235 on the cream-separator principle by machines devised in the University of Virginia . Probably most of the secret research which has been conducted in this country for at least three years has been focused on separation , evidently with success . Another problem was the control of the process whereby U-235 is split and enormous energy released . U-235 can be sundered by a slow neutron only ; a fast neutron is simply absorbed . But fast neutrons can be slowed down by the hydrogen in water or paraffin . When this is done four times as many neutrons can be hurled at U-235 with correspondingly more frightful results . No matter how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nucleus of the bombarded atom itself , and each of these by-product neutrons is in turn capable of smashing neighboring uranium atoms . So we have what the physicist calls a " chain reaction . " How this chain reaction is controlled is still a mystery . A neutron with an energy of only one-thirtieth of a volt can release two hundred million volts from a uranium atom , or six billion times as much energy as it possesses itself . Here is the reason why the new bomb is the most terrible weapon ever invented . What began with attempts to break the atom , into its parts in order to discover how the universe is put together ends for the moment with the deadliest military weapon . * * * The potentialities of this first harnessing of atomic energy are unlimited . Einstein showed that matter is simply congealed energy and that the one can be theoretically converted into the other . From his simple equation it can be calculated that if all the atoms in one pound of any soil could be annihilated about a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply New York with electrical energy for a year . It will probably be many a year before engineers can think of substituting U-235 for coal and oil . If that high stage of technology is ever reached we need not picture a world with power plants very different from those we have . Steam will be raised by the heat of atomic energy , with turbines still turning generators , so far as we can see now . For the moment we have enough to think about when the fact sinks in that a lump of uranium no bigger than a walnut contains as much potential energy as 1,250 pounds of good soft coal  --  if it can be extracted and utilized . The main point to be kept in mind is that this world is driven by energy and that out of this war has come the first invention which has made it possible to use , unfortunately for destruction , the energy in stuff that rated only a little higher than dirt , and that dirt itself is worth more in terms of energy than all the coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
