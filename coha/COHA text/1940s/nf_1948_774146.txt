txt  | ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE UNIVERSALS The issue of " concepts " versus " general ideas , " as it emerges from the discussions of the preceding sections , seems to me to be essentially the same as that of " abstract " versus " concrete " universals ? an issue which goes to the very heart of an old philosophical problem , but one which may also provide a test-stone for various " modern " philosophies . Let me try to state the issue clearly . We have already seen that the use of words entails inevitably a recourse to " universals " ; for name-giving involves both identification and differentiation ? identification of the referent to which the name is applied , and differentiation of that referent from all referents to which the name is not to be applied . Name-giving , in other words , involves classification . It involves recognizing a specific referent as being a certain kind or type , as being an instance of a class ? as when a certain animal is named cat ' and another is named dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is universal because it names a class . It specifies or designates the attributes which the members of the class have in common . Since any attribute may become the basis for classification , any attribute whatever may define a class , i.e. , it may define a universal . If this is true , then it is at once evident that not all universals so defined are of equal cognitive importance . The class of mammals , for example , has greater scientific significance than has the class of blue objects . But something else must also be noted ? the fact , namely , that any given class may contain a subclass and may , in turn , be a subclass of some other class : square , rectangle , parallelogram , quadrilateral , rectilinear plane figure , plane figure , figure , .... ; domesticated dogs , dogs , doglike carnivores , carnivorous mammals , mammals , vertebrates , chordate animals , many-celled animals , animals , living beings , .... ; light blue , blue , color , something seen , something perceived , something we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in formal logic has been called the " inverse relation of extension and intension " ; they reveal , in other words , that the range of application of a term is , roughly speaking , inversely proportional to its specificality of meaning ; that in each case the more inclusive class Bl is obtained when we omit certain attributes from the definition of the less inclusive class Al and retain only those attributes which are common to several classes , Al , A2 , A3 , .... That is to say , such series of ever-expanding classes seem to imply ( 1 ) that universals are  | formed by a process of omission and abstraction ; ( 2 ) that the broader and more comprehensive a class is , the more devoid it is of meaning ; and ( 3 ) that in each case a class is only a simplified " general idea " of a group of individuals . Let us suppose for a moment that I observe a number of figures on a piece of paper . Upon closer inspection I discover that some of the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are right-angled triangles . Omitting the characteristics of acute-angularity , obtuse-angularity , and rectangularity , I now form the more general , the more abstract , idea of triangularity , i.e. , I conceive the more inclusive class , " triangles . " But then I discover that among the figures under observation there are some which are formed , not by three straight lines , but by four , five , and even more . Still , all of them are rectilinear figures . Hence , by omitting any specification as to the number of lines used in constructing the figures , i.e. , by carrying the process of abstraction a step further , I form the new and broader class of " rectilinear figures . " Further inspection of the figures on the piece of paper may reveal figures which are not composed of straight lines at all , namely , the curvilinear figures ( circles , ellipses , etc . ) . Omitting all reference to the type of lines which form the figures on the paper but retaining whatever elements all of the figures have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane figures " ? a class which has thus been obtained by a continued process of abstraction and the definition of which is , correspondingly , empty of meaning . It is the " abstract universal " ; but is it also the concept in the full cognitive sense in which we encountered it in the sciences ? The answer to this question is an unqualified No ; and this No can be justified in a twofold way : ( 1 ) by disclosing the inadequacies and intrinsic difficulties of any theory of abstract universals , and ( 2 ) by giving a positive interpretation of the meaning of universals ( Blanshard ) . ( 1 ) The negative argument involves at least three distinct aspects of the doctrine of abstract universals . ( a ) A universal , if separated from its differentiations , loses all meaning . The universal " plane figure , " in the example given above , was derived by omitting from its definition all reference to straight and curved lines . The " plane figure , " in other words , is neither a rectilinear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Actually , no such figure can exist nor can it be thought . A " plane figure " is a figure at all only because it  | consists of lines in particular arrangements ; and lines are lines only if they are either straight or curved . A " figure " composed of lines which are neither straight nor curved is an Unding . It is inconceivable . If we abstract from the lines composing it , a figure ceases to be a figure . What is true in the case of " figures " is true , mutatis mutandi , in the case of all other abstract universals . As soon as we separate the universal from its differentiations , it becomes meaningless . The generalized and abstract " human being , " for example , who is neither male nor female , neither child nor adult , neither white nor black nor red nor yellow , neither tall nor short , neither rational nor without reason , and so on , but is just " human being , " is no more conceivable than is a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A universal , in order to be thinkable at all , must remain inseparably intertwined with its differentiations. ( b ) Abstract universals have little , if any , cognitive significance ? a fact which becomes apparent the moment we try to apply the universal , i.e. , the moment we attempt to get from the universal to its " species . " If a universal is the product of abstraction , then the transition to a species under that universal can be achieved only by the addition of attributes . And since the abstract universal does not define in a compelling manner what its species are to be , the addition of attributes , i.e. , the definition of species , is casual and haphazard . In fact , the addition of any attribute will do so long as the added characteristic is compatible with the generalized universal . For example , in the abstract universal , " quadrilateral plane figure , " there is nothing which compels us to retain as its species the " trapeziums " and the " parallelograms " ; we can just as readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quadrilaterals , " " blue quadrilaterals " ; or " large quadrilaterals , " " small quadrilaterals " ; or " quadrilaterals drawn on a blackboard " and " quadrilaterals drawn in my notebook . " But this freedom from restraint is no aid to cognition . After all , to be a trapezium or a parallelogram are ways of being a quadrilateral plane figure ; to be great or small , or to be drawn on a blackboard or in my notebook , are not . The former characteristics are integral to the universal , the latter are external , or accidental , to it . To treat both types as if they were of equal significance involves a complete misunderstanding of the cognitive function of universals .  | ( c ) The emptiness of the abstract universal corresponds to no emptiness of experience or of thought ( cf. Blanshard ) . If the theory of the abstract universal were correct , a wider range of application of a term should entail an increased paucity of meaning , an increased emptiness , because that wider range is obtained only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our actual experience ! Suppose , for example , little Robert gets his first dog , Spotty , a nondescript mongrel . An image of Spotty will then represent more or less completely Robert 's idea of dog . But soon afterwards , Robert may become acquainted with Harry 's fox terrier , or with Mr. Jones 's German shepherd ; and his idea of dog expands . He realizes that not all dogs have all the characteristics of Spotty . As time goes on , Robert may come to know also a collie , a bulldog , and a setter ; and if he takes an interest in dogs , he soon discovers that there exist greyhounds and pugs , St. Bernards and Pekingese , poodles and dachshunds , Scotch terriers and pointers , deerhounds and beagles , Dalmations and spaniels , great Danes and Boston terriers , wild dogs of the Orient and the dingos of Australia , and many other kinds of dog . As Robert 's experience with dogs widens , he finds fewer and fewer attributes which all dogs have in common . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meaning of the term dog ' would contract for Robert until it approached the vanishing point . Actually , however , the meaning of dog ' is now for him incomparably richer than it was at the beginning ; for he knows that the universal can manifest itself in all these differentiations . When he now speaks of dogs , he does not speak of a class of animals which is but a generalized idea of Spotty ; he has at his command a ready reference to many varieties and species of dog , and to many individual dogs , and his universal dog , ' as genus , is diffused with the knowledge of all these varieties and individuals . Compared to this richness and fullness of meaning the abstract universal is a vague and amorphous idea . It is at the most only a germinal thought which comes to fruition in and through the differentiation of species , and which comes to full realization only in the individuals . This , however , means that it attains full cognitive significance only as concrete universal . ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no abstract dogness which remains completely unmodified in the various species , and from which the species can be " derived " by adding , from without , new attributes to the original self-identical core . Similarly , there  | is no abstract treeness , coloredness , squareness , or any other universal whose relation to its subordinate species is as casual and external as it would have to be if the doctrine of abstract universals were true . The universal , properly understood , is the law of the species , and the species are instances of that law . The universal is a concept in the sense in which we have previously defined this term . What is meant here is probably most readily understood if we replace the essential negativity of the abstract universals by a positive interpretation . Thus , the meaning of triangle ' is not an amorphous something which is neither obtuse-angled nor acute-angled nor rightangled , but it is a triangular figure which must be either obtuse-angled or acute-angled or right-angled . Where the abstract universal is essentially negation ? an exclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a particularizing and exhaustive alternation . The specifications of the different species are taken up into the very definition of the genus , and the genus is conceived only as the genus of such and such species . The genus , in other words , is defined in such a manner that it logically implies the species which are modes of " being the genus , " and no others ; and no such implication is possible so long as we deal with abstract universals ( cf. Blanshard ) . To be sure , it is difficult to achieve adequate definitions of concrete universals ; for they presuppose an exhaustive study of all relevant matters , a thorough and intimate comprehension of all the referents in question . Such definitions are therefore the goal rather than the starting-point of scientific inquiry . Their cognitive value is , however , correspondingly great ; for an integrated system of concrete universals eliminates all elements of subjectivity from knowledge and discloses the essential attributes of all referents defined . The differentia specifica , and with it the conception of species , is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each case by the genus in question as a mode of being that genus . The highest genus , as concrete universal , is the law of the whole of reality . Its definition is the ultimate but infinitely remote goal of all inquiry ; and to its definition all branches of knowledge must make their contributions . THE PROBLEM OF OBJECTIVITY The theory of concepts and of concrete universals here developed cuts the ground from under the old controversy between nominalists and realists and implies an idea of objectivity which finds special recognition in the various sciences .  | Against nominalism ( which is essentially a theory of abstract universals ) , the theory of concrete universals maintains that universals are not merely " names " but " laws " determining the character of the subordinate species ; while against realism it insists that universals exist not in some special realm and by themselves but in the particulars and as the essential character of particulars . Both points are fairly obvious . The implied solution of the problem of objectivity , however , may require a somewhat fuller discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and proceeds from a position best described as " naive realism " ? the position , namely , that real things are " given " in experience and are " given " as they really are ; that knowledge consists in a generalized understanding of these things , and that the objective validity of judgments and laws stems from a correspondence between our ideas and the real things . Strict empiricism and all doctrines of the abstract universal derive their support from this basic contention and do not essentially transcend it . Yet , the position referred to is not only inadequate but false . Let us examine one of the so-called " given " objects of experience . No matter how simple and unitary it appears to be at first glance , closer inspection reveals its complex nature ; and the more closely we examine it , the greater the manifoldness of its attributes turns out to be . If the object in question is a patch of color , it possesses not only a distinctive hue ( such as red or blue or green ) , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dark green ) , a particular degree of saturation ( or purity ) , and a certain brightness ( or luster ) . As " patch " it has form and size and is divisible , and it may be homogeneous ( or heterogeneous ) in all ( or some ) of its qualities in all ( or some ) of its parts . If it is the color of a " surface , " still other qualities are involved , such as roughness or smoothness to touch , warmth or coolness , resistance to pressure , and so on . The list of attributes given here is suggestive rather than exhaustive ; and we have not even referred to the manifold relations which this " patch of color " has to other " given " objects . Taking it all in all , the complexity of a " given " object is inexhaustible . No idea we have of it can be , in the strict sense , a copy of such a thing ; and if it were , it would be as complex as the thing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex world . After all , cognition is possible only if we can simplify the complex manifold of experience and can reduce it to " law and order . " Simplification , however , means selection ; and this simplification through  | selection is achieved through the use of concepts . Concepts , in other words , are not " copies " of things ? not even " generalized ideas " obtained through the omission of " unimportant " details ? but cognitive tools designed to establish law and order in the inexhaustible manifoldness of the " given , " and thus to make that manifoldness intelligible and amenable to reason . The simplification here referred to must be at least two-dimensional . ( 1 ) It must integrate into one unitary whole the various aspects of the same " given " as they are revealed in different experiential situations ; and ( 2 ) it must bring different objects under the same concept . Happily , achievement of the former entails the latter ; and both tasks are thus accomplished through the use of concepts . In our discussions up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather loosely as designating something " given " in all its complexity . I fear that we have used the term as an abstract universal . Henceforth we shall mean by object ' that integrated unity of ( actual or possible ) experiences established through the concept . The emphasis here lies upon " integrated unity " ; for the object is no mere aggregate of attributes . It is , rather , a unity necessitating the togetherness of these and no other attributes . And in this sense , as defining the necessity of this unity , the concept is the " law " of the object ? a rule of integration . Our thesis is that every conceptual synthesis of experiential elements is based on the assumption that the synthesized elements belong together necessarily , and that the idea of this necessity is embodied in the concept ; that it is the very essence of the concept . Concepts , therefore , are at heart judgments ? judgments asserting a necessary interdependence of attributes . The concept body , ' for example , asserts the necessary interrelation of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , " " divisibility , " " mass " ( as distinguished from " weight " ) , " duration in time , " and so on ; and any object which can be subsumed under this concept must possess all of these attributes in addition to the attributes which are necessary characteristics of its specificality as this kind of a body . Concepts , in other words , legislate for objects . The individual object would be of no cognitive interest to us if its concept were not a law , in the sense defined , holding for all cases of its kind , i.e. , if the concept were not universally and unconditionally valid for the objects defined in it . However , not even such universality discloses the full significance of concepts . If all concepts were strictly unrelated , we would still be in a pre-  | carious position with respect to cognition . Not only must it be possible to form concepts which integrate and simplify specific aspects of the manifold of experience , but a system of interdependent concepts must give systemic unity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such unity . Ideally , there must be a " law " of laws , an ultimate concept which includes all others and from which all others can be derived as entailed consequences . The trend toward such a law ( or ultimate concept ) is quite evident in the sciences and finds general recognition in the ideal of " unified science . " All inquiry aims at " systemic unity " and cognition finds its rationale in this aim . In the sciences , the concepts themselves are defined with this aim in view ; they are " pointed toward " the system . That under these conditions the concepts of the various sciences bear the imprint of the system is not surprising . But this is a matter which we shall discuss when we deal with the special categories of the sciences ; now our chief interest is centered around other matters . We seem to have strayed rather far from the announced topic of " objectivity " ; but what has been said so far should be regarded as introductory to the problem in question . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objectivity is grounded in our theory of concepts . The most difficult problem for empiricism is the problem of the validity of the " laws of nature , " i.e. , the problem of the objectivity of scientific knowledge ; for empiricism , in the strict sense , is inseparable from the theory of abstract universals . Its " concepts " are obtained through the process of abstraction previously described . But upon this basis the " laws of nature " can be only empirical generalizations without compelling universality . The enumeration and comparison of a finite number of instances , i.e. , the process of abstractive generalization , can never justify a universality which transcends the realm of examined instances . From the fact that some observed bodies fall in conformity with the equation s= 1-at2 we can not infer by abstractive generalization that all bodies must fall in the manner described by this law . Moreover , the process of abstractive generalization itself can not proceed arbitrarily but only according to some principle of selection which determines in each case of generalization why these , rather than some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the principle guiding the abstractive selection is accepted as " self-evident " or is implicitly assumed rather than explicitly stated or recognized . More  | often than not it stems from the pragmatic requirements of " practical living . " For example , in this way is determiiied what constitutes a " thing " for the naive realist . Abstractive selection , however , culminates in classification , but classification is never the end or goal of science . That end is rather a system of universally valid and compelling laws . Classification is always arbitrary and , in this sense , subjective . Science , on the other hand , aims at universal validity , i.e. , it aims at the elimination of that which is purely arbitrary in knowledge , and thus tries to achieve objectivity . Since the method of abstractive generalization can not achieve this objectivity , it has been assumed by some that the objective validity which science claims for its laws derives from the relation of our concepts to some " ultimate reality . " Realists of various shades have made this assumption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things as they are becomes the criterion of objectivity . This view , however , also encounters insurmountable difficulties . Not only does it involve the well-known problem of how such correspondence can ever be detected , but it also fails to explain the nature of scientific knowledge . The " world without attributes " as disclosed , for instance , in pure mechanics is no longer a reality ? ultimate or otherwise . The more fundamental and , in the scientific sense , perfect our concepts are , the less they contain of reality and the more they become implements for our intellectual mastery over the manifold complexities of experience . But let us assume , for the sake of argument , that things really consist of " atoms " in the logical sense ( we know that the " physical atoms " of chemistry are not ultimates ) . Even so it is obvious that we can obtain the concept of atoms only through an analysis , and interpretation presupposes certain principles of selection and simplification and involves concepts previously defined by means of these principles . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can form the concept of atoms , i.e. , before we can assert a correspondence between our thought of atoms and some real atoms . And if this is true , then it is vicious reasoning to base the validity of our principles upon the " real existence " of some " thing " or " reality " the very concept of which can be formed only upon the basis of those principles themselves . If , nevertheless , we assume a connection between such a reality and the principles presupposed in all concept-forming , we are forced to accept a " pre-established harmony " between the two realms ? a result ,  | incidentally , which leaves the problem of objectivity unsolved ; for under the conditions of a " pre-established harmony " the validity of concepts and laws remains as mysterious as ever . Objectivity , as aimed at in the sciences , is possible and perfectly intelligible on the basis of the doctrine or concepts developed in the preceding sections . All that is necessary for our understanding is that we disregard our ( already discredited ) naively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , i.e. , the objective significance of our concepts , depend upon a correspondence with some assumed reality , we must realize that our idea of reality itself has significance only because it is based upon the objective validity of our concepts and laws . Science conceptually integrates experience in conformity with the laws and principles of thought which determine the formation of concepts , and the integrated system of the interdependent concepts implies and justifies our idea of reality . Reality , at the beginning of our inquiry , is but a task , a problem , an X. It emerges at the end as that totality of actual and possible experiences which is integrated in and through our system of concepts . The objectivity and universal validity upon which science depends are the objectivity and universal validity of compelling thought as incorporated in our integrating concepts . Reality is the ultimate achievement of that thought . In the chapters which follow , we shall carry through the ideas here indicated . In Part II , the idea of systemic wholeness and integration will be applied to the realms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and IV it will be shown that the ideal of an integrated and closed system is the moving force and directive behind all formal and empirical sciences . It will thus be seen that one basic idea ? the conception of systemic integration ? provides the clue to our understanding of the basis and structure of knowledge .  | THE WORLD ABOUT US The thesis stated in the last paragraphs of the preceding chapter must now be demonstrated in greater detail . We begin with an analysis of that world-view which is experientially prior to all philosophical reflection ? the world-view of the non-philosophical person , of the so-called " naive realist . " NAIVE REALISM As naive realists we all believe that there exists a world about us ? a world of mountains , lakes , birds , flowers , trees , houses , tables , books , and a myriad of other " things . " We believe that we were born into this world , live in it for a number of years , and die ; and that this world with its galaxies , streams , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its beauty and tragedy , will continue to exist long after we have gone ? just as it existed long before we were born . We believe that we can know this world , directly and immediately , as it really is ; that we see it , hear it , smell it , taste it , and literally grasp it with our hands . Our faith in the reality of that world has been built up and supported by uncountable experiences from infancy on to our present state of maturity . As children , we encountered this world in its most intimate relation to our appetites and desires . It was a world we could " finger " and " handle , " a world of " things " which we could grasp and hold , possess or lose . But lost " things " we could find again ; and the very fact that we could lose them proved that they were independent of our possessing them , of our grasping and holding them . " Things " were something which might be grasped or which might be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects was beyond our control . This " independence " of " things " characterizes reality not only for the child ; it does so also for the unsophisticated adult , although the actual " grasping " may have given way to a " pointing " or " indicating " that there are the " things " which we regard as real . As adults , however , we distinguish our ideas of things from the " things " themselves ; and we say that these ideas exist only " in our  | mind , " whereas the " things " exist all about us in an " external world . " In other words , we distinguish between an " inner " and an " outer " reality . We become naive dualists . This does not mean that the two realms are completely unrelated in our naive world-view . Somehow they constitute a context of dependency ? even though the nature of this dependency is not clear to us . We are sure that if there existed no real trees we would have no visual images or ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real " things " produce the ideas within us . Now , within the context of the two realms ? the inner and the outer ? a " thing " is a special form of the real . It is that in which specific characteristics of the real are embodied . The " thing " has attributes . The attributes somehow belong to the " thing , " and the " thing " is in some way the bearer of these attributes . The exact relation of " thing " and attributes can not be defined at this naive level of thought but this much at least seems certain : the " thing " and its attributes are inseparable . Think away all attributes , and the " thing " itself has disappeared . Still , the " thing " is not identical with any one of its attributes , nor even with some specific group of them . It is , rather , the totality , the unified whole , and persists even when some of its attributes are changed . The " thing , " in other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes and still remain itself . Every change , however , is regarded as the effect of some cause , as the result of something which produces it ? whatever the " something " may be . Hence , for the naive realist , the reality of " things " is intertwined with the idea of effects . And , since " things " can produce effects , they can ( and do ) leave their imprint upon our senses . We see them , feel them , hear them , taste them , smell them ; and our senseimpressions disclose the very nature of the " things . " The rose yonder is as red or as white as we see it ; this lump of sugar is as sweet as it tastes ; and that fragrance of an orange is a real property of the orange itself . For the naive and uncritical person this is all there is to the " mystery " of real " things . " CRITICAL EVALUATION Occasionally our naive faith is challenged ; for occasionally our senses lead us astray or furnish contradictory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see it at some distance in the fog ) may turn out to be a tree ( when we get closer to it ) . The peculiar specks which  | move across the sky in a V-shaped formation may turn out to be wild geese rather than airplanes ( as we first thought ) . Somehow error occurs in our dealing with " things , " and its occurrence may puzzle us . If our senses disclose the very nature of " things , " how is it possible that at times they lead us astray ? As a rule , our contact with " things " at the level of naive realism is of pragmatic significance only . We want to use the " things " for practical purposes of living and " making a living . " We therefore " correct " the error , i.e. , we readjust our pragmatic attitude , and do not pursue the critical question . If , however , our interest is primarily in cognition , i.e. , if we want to find out what really constitutes knowledge , the occurrence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our encounter with illusions of various types may make us even more critical . Is the stick in the water really bent ? as it appears to be ? And if it is not , do my senses still disclose the nature of " things " as they are ? At this point we may begin to regard our naive faith with some distrust . We may begin to doubt the adequacy or reliability of an uncritical attitude . Still , this doubt may at first involve only the validity of some particular cognitive experience , not of cognition itself . It may be necessary to " correct " repeatedly this , that , or the other specific perception of a " thing " ; but the very fact that the correction is made shows an underlying faith in cognition as such . An error can not be recognized as an error , or an illusion as an illusion , if we do not possess some standard of " true " cognition ; and a correction of the error can not be made , or an illusion allowed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our standard . But whence do we get this faith ? How can we justify our standard ? What is its warranty ? These questions bring to the fore the very crux of the matter . They cut the ground from under our naive and uncritical attitude and make cognition itself a problem . Those who deny the significance of epistemological discussions have , I fear , never really faced these basic questions . One thing , however , we must keep in mind clearly . The questions challenging the cognitive faith of naive realism arise not because we have lost faith in cognition , not because we have despaired of ever knowing reality , but because we desire that our " faith " be no longer a blind " animal faith , " a naive and uncritical acceptance of the  | " evidence of our senses , " of the " givenness of reality , " but rather a warranted belief ; that it be knowledge rather than faith . Our interest in the challenging questions may be motivated in different ways ; but all of them center around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the warranty for our faith , that the " things " themselves furnish the standard of true knowledge as distinguished from error and illusion , and that in perception we come to know these " things " as they really are . It is this idea of the standard of cognition which breaks down and becomes untenable under analysis . Suppose , for example , we ask , Is the mountain we see over there the same mountain we saw here last year when we drove along this same road ? The answer to this question , so it seems , must be an emphatic Yes . If we now ask , How can we be so sure ? the naive realist will , no doubt , be amazed at our question . And if we press our point he either dogmatically asserts that it " just is " or he explains to us that if it were not the same mountain , then a miracle must have happened , and that such miracles are impossible . But how does the naive realist know that such miracles are impossible ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question we have asked concerning the identity of the mountain is neither idle nor meaningless ; for if we had asked , Is the book we find on the table when we return to our room the very same book which we left there when we went out ? the question would not seem so amazing . Somebody could have exchanged the book for another one during our absence . But both questions ? one pertaining to the mountain , the other to the book ? are fundamentally of the same type ; for both are equivalent to the question , What assurance do we have that " things " remain what they are when we do not observe them ? The answer to this question must of necessity transcend all perception ; for even if we assert dogmatically and naively that they " just do , " we already go beyond what we perceive . What , incidentally , is meant by " the same thing " ? If a piece of ice is melted and becomes water , if this water is boiled and becomes steam , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautifully symmetric crystals of snow , are we throughout this process dealing with " the same thing " ? Is the chicken still " the same thing " as the egg from which it was hatched , or the oak " the same thing " as the acorn from which it grew ? Are ashes and smoke still " the same thing " as the wood which was burned ? Are sense-percep-  | tions sufficient to answer questions such as these ? Or must we again have recourse to something which transcends mere perception ? And if the latter , what is this " something " to which reference must be made ? Is it the " thing itself " ? Just what do we actually know about a " thing itself " ? The naive realist maintains that " things " are as we perceive them to be . But , surely , this can not be so ; for the qualities of our senseperceptions depend upon the conditions of our sense-organs as much as upon the nature of the " things . " The very same substance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and be perfectly tasteless to another ; and this difference in taste is a hereditary ( Mendelian ) trait . Perhaps even more to the point are various modifications of the taste qualities . Sour-flavored candies ( lemon drops , etc. ) , for example , taste insipidly sweet when eaten in the tropics ( cf. Cricker ) . Is the same candy actually sour or is it sweet ? Do raw onions and cinnamon possess the same taste quality because both taste sweet when our sense of smell is shut off ? Do bicarbonate of soda , milk of magnesia , very ripe cantaloupes , clams , and shrimp possess in themselves and as " things " an " alkaline taste " quality despite the fact that this so-called " taste " is but a peculiar feeling in our mouth which results from slight injuries to the delicate mucous membrane due to the chemical action of the substance in question ? In other words , do the experienced taste qualities actually disclose the nature of " things " as they really are ? Place a narrow " gray " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cover both with thin tissue paper . The strip now looks " red . " Is the strip itself gray or is it red ? We all know that a rose which is red in the bright light of day appears to be black in twilight . Is the real rose red or is it black ? Or are red and black and all the other colors which we see experienced qualities which depend on many factors ? such as the conditions of our color receptors and the conditions of light ? and which can therefore not be directly ascribed to the " things " themselves ? If we chill our left hand by placing it on a cake of ice , and warm our right hand on a stove , and if we then plunge both hands into a pail full of lukewarm water , the water feels hot to the chilled hand and cold to the warmed hand ; but is the water itself both hot and cold ? Or must we give up the idea that our senses disclose the very nature of " things " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not  | to accept the evidence of our senses at face value . The physicist , for instance , tells us that the pine tree in front of our window is not really there as we perceive it , in its beauty and fragrance . What is really " there , " he contends , is a more or less orderly and coherent aggregation of molecules and atoms of an electrical nature , causing certain " ether vibrations " ( or what not ) to stimulate the retina of our eye . This stimulation is carried to the brain , so the physiologist tells us ; and there , if we may believe the psychologist , a specific reaction occurs and we perceive the " pine . " In a similar manner , so we are told , we " perceive " sounds as our reactions to certain air vibrations which stimulate our auditory apparatus , and the taste of strawberries as our reaction to certain chemical actions upon the taste-buds of our tongue . The sensed quale of red " corresponds " to a physical wave-length of about 660 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ( 1 ? =1 / 1000 mm ; 1 ? ? = 1 / 1000 ? ) . The sound Al has as its " real " physical counterpart air vibrations of wavelengths 772 mm . Salty taste is always due to ions , while sour taste is caused only by hydrogen ions . " Wave-lengths , " " ionic states , " etc. ? such are the scientific counterparts of our sensory qualities ; and in view of such facts , the naive faith that perception discloses the nature of " things " as they really are , that it gives us an accurate and adequate " copy " of the attributes of " things , " becomes untenable . All so-called " secondary qualities " ? colors , sounds , tastes , smells , warmth , hardness , etc. ? disappear from the world of real " things . " There is left only a world of vibrations and whirling electrons ? dark , colorless , silent ? utterly different from our perceptual world . There remains only the world of " atoms , " of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , density , number , motion , and a causeeffect relationship ? the world of " primary qualities " which science studies . But is this the real world ? Extension , shape , size , motion , and solidity , abstracted from all perceptual qualities , are inconceivable ; and number and position are relative to the predilections of percipient minds . Hence , it would seem that neither the " secondary " nor the " primary " qualities can be attributed directly to the " things " themselves . But let us assume for a moment that the world of " primary " qualities is the real world ? the world as it endures in time and as it exists in space . The question then arises , What are space and time ? Are they , as the great receptacles which contain the world , also real ? Are they entities of some sort , existing " things " in their own right ?  | Conceived as real entities , both space and time turn out to be impossible . They certainly are not " things " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and stars and planets are " things , " for they possess none of the attributes of " things " of this type . They do not consist of atoms and whirling electrons , of vibrations or energy emanations ; they act upon no physical " things , " nor do physical " things " act upon them ; they do not enter into cause and effect relations with anything ; they have no mass ; nor are they impenetrable ; we neither see nor feel them , nor do they offer resistance to anything . Hence , if they are entities at all , they must be entities of a peculiar type ; they must be sui generis . But is time an entity ? If so , in what sense can it be said to be real ? Surely , the past is gone and the future is not yet . If time is real at all , it can be so only now , at this moment , while it is still the present . But what is this " present " ? It can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time interval we may think of involves past , present , and future moments . Strictly speaking , therefore , the present is only that indivisible ( because unextended ) moment in which the future ( which is not yet ) becomes the past ( which has been ) . Of the " time flux " nothing remains but this " now " which is the divide between two unrealities . It is a strange " thing " indeed that can have such an existence . Time , conceived as a real entity , as the " equable flux from eternity to eternity " ( to use Newton 's terminology ) , evaporates into nothingness . And what about space ? Conceived as a real " entity " it can be at best only an infinite " void " or infinite " emptiness " ? a " void " because it must exist independently of all " things " that may be " put into it , " and infinite because it can not be bounded or limited in any sense or direction . It is inconceivable , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed whole ; for it can be shown that the very idea of infinity is meaningful only as an unending progression or , rather , as an unending sequence of finite steps taken in strict conformity with a specified law of progression . Furthermore , if space is regarded as a real entity , it must at least be an extended " void . " But if it is an extended something , does it not presuppose something else in which it can be extended ? a " space " in which it can be an extended " void " ? And if it does , what about this other " space " ? Is it also a real entity ? If it is , how can we avoid the infinite regress of " spaces " which contain " spaces " which contain space ? Lastly , there is no valid argument which would justify the conten-  | tion that space and time are in themselves existing and real entities . Our senses disclose no such " things . " Newton 's arguments either rest upon premises which modern physics can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in question ; and Euler 's reasoning rests upon the assumption that classical ( Newtonian ) mechanics is the absolute and true interpretation of physical nature ? an assumption which has been repudiated through the advance of relativity mechanics . The only constructive and tenable interpretations of space and time all agree on this , that space and time are not entities at all but are objective orders of integration , that they are conditions of physical existence and of motion but that their objective character is a " construct " and that it depends upon the principles which we accept for the interpretation of experience . Is space , for example , Euclidean or non-Euclidean in character ? It all depends on how we interpret the interrelation of " things " in space . We shall shortly dwell upon this point more fully . Now , if space and time are not real entities but relational " constructs , " what becomes of the world of real " things " which was supposed to exist in a real space and a real time ? This world , as will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material " things , " of atoms and their configurations , of " things " which fill " space " and persist in " time . " However , even in classical mechanics " matter " was largely identified with mass and mass with resistance to a change in the state of rest or motion . Mass or matter , therefore , was actually defined only in relation to " force . " Faraday and Maxwell then introduced the conception of " fields of forces , " and the " material " world was expanded in a direction still further away from the conceptions and tangibleness of immediate experience . Finally , as a result of quantum mechanical theories , the " substantiality " of the solid atoms was dissolved into " energy patterns , " and even the electrons , protons , neutrons , and other " elementary particles " were reduced to " states of IIII energy , " to " phase waves " and " regions of maximum amplitudes of phase waves . " In no sense , therefore , can it be said now that our senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are ; and ? what is much more important for modern philosophy ? the whole idea that science discloses the nature of " things " upon which rests the objectivity , i.e. , the objective validity , of thought is now so obviously wrong that one wonders how it could ever have arisen . Every attempt to justify the objective validity of thought through Ili an appeal to the " nature of things " as disclosed in the sciences involves a vicious circle ; for the nature of those " things " can be known to us  | only because thought , as employed in the interpretation and integration of immediate experience , is in itself objectively valid and compelling . There is no warranty for this objectivity except the nature of thought itself . And the " world about us , " far from providing a secure basis for thought , emerges as an intelligible reality only because thought , in its objective validity and as employed in the integration of our immediate and first-person experiences , leads to the " construction " of such a world . METHODOLOGICAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not prove itself as warranted belief in my own first-person experience I can not accept as knowledge , no matter what its knowledge-claim may be . In the preceding section we have seen that the objective validity of thought can not be proven by an appeal to an existing real world but that , on the contrary , our knowledge of this world presupposes and is dependent upon that validity . Both these together imply ( 1 ) that only in our first-person experience can we discover the warranty for the objective validity of thought , and ( 2 ) that only through the employment of thought in the interpretation and integration of first-person experience can we come to know what constitutes the world about us . The " things " are not given but are conceived as the implied completion of an integrating and constructive process of thought . If this is at all a fair statement of the broadest aspects of our cognition of " things , " then , it seems , it suggests an approach to the basic problems of knowledge which may best be described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as it starts with an analysis and interpretation of first-person experience ? specifically , with an analysis and interpretation of my first-person experience , or of yours if you yourself carry through the integration . And it is " methodological " rather than absolute or metaphysical in so far as it implies no a priori and final restriction to the realm of first-person experience . On the contrary , it is hoped that all the elements of objectivity which carry us beyond the immediacy of first-person experience can be found within that experience itself ; for , if they can not be found here , they can not be found at all . THE STARTING-POINT All knowledge , we repeat , is rooted in , and grows out of , experience . Our view concerning the world about us ? concerning its structure , its reality , and its ultimate nature ? must find its justification in  | experience or must remain without justification . The word ' experience , ' however , has different meanings for different persons . We shall use it here in the broad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " awareness , " a " taking notice " of " something . " Awareness , in this sense , I take to be a state or condition sui generis which escapes formal definition . We know , however , what is meant from our own personal state of " being aware " or " taking notice " of something . When we hear a sound , see a color , remember a dream , have an illusion , or contemplate the future , we are " aware " and " take notice , " and the situation is one of " experience " in the broad sense here intended . As yet no distinction is made between " things " and " ideas , " between " reality " and " unreality , " " rationality " and " irrationality " ; and an " illusion " or " hallucination " has as much right to be taken into consideration as has a " perception " or a " sense-datum . " Anything whatsoever of which we may be aware , or of which we may take notice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be imposed upon the number or variety of the elements found in experience ; for such a restriction would be a metaphysical prejudice . No selection of special types of elements can be made in advance of the complete analysis and interpretation ; for any advance selection implies methodological bias , if nothing worse . However , experience is bipolar . The something of which notice is taken is invariably and inescapably related to some " notice-taker . " If awareness occurs , then there is a " something " which is aware of a " something else . " We shall speak of the subject pole and the object pole of experience , but shall mean by these " poles " not entities which exist outside the bipolar complexity called experience , but relata within the encompassing whole known as experience ? a " whole , " which is what it is only by virtue of the unique awareness-relation in which subject pole and object pole stand to each other . What is ordinarily , and in the empirical sense , regarded as " subject " and " object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respective " poles , " pointing far beyond the primordial experience-relation here intended . Experience , as here understood , is a factum in the sense that it is implicitly and unavoidably present in every assertion we make , so that even its denial is proof of its actuality . Experience , in other words , is self-revealing . As soon as you affirm , doubt , or deny anything ? and regardless of whatever else you may be ? you are already one of the  | " poles " within the bipolar manifold of experience of which that which you affirm , doubt , or deny is ( part of ) the other " pole . " The empirical " self " or " person , " however , is at this stage of analysis as much of a problem as is the empirical " thing " or the whole " external world . " Now , it so happens that the only " subject pole " of which we can be indubitably certain is the one which we designate by the first-person pronoun " I " and/or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mine . " 1 You know yourself to be such a " subject pole " and I know myself to be one also . But you are for " me " part of the " object pole " of " my " experience , just as I am part of the " object pole " of " your " experience . No matter how intimate our relations to each other may be in other respects , as " poles " in experience we must remain eternally distinct as " subject pole " and " object pole , " respectively , depending on who interprets his experience . In the last analysis , therefore , we can proceed in our interpretation of experience only by inspecting what is the " object pole " in relation to the one " subject pole " we call " I. " For the sake of brevity I shall call the experience centering in some specific " subject pole " a firstperson experience ? " your " first-person experience , or " mine , " as the case may be . However , " I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I " am the " subject pole . " Whatsoever does not constitute part of " my " first-person experience , or is not related to it in some definite and determinable way , must always remain unknown and unknowable to " me . " This is true of " revelations " no less than of " sense perceptions " and of " logical deductions . " Unless something is revealed to " me , " or is communicated to " me " as having been revealed to persons of whom " I " have ( or could have ) some knowledge , the matter " revealed " can play no part in " my " knowledge ; just as the sense perception which " I " do not have or of which " I " am not informed in some way can not enter into knowledge as far as " I " am concerned . Of knowledge which is not " my " knowledge , which does not enter in some way into " my " first-person experience , " I " do know and " I " can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I " which is the " subject pole " of " my " first-person experience ? or of " yours , " if you analyze " your " experience ? is as yet not the empirical self or person ordinarily referred to by the personal pronoun , but is a relatum within the 1 " I , " " me , " " my , " " mine " ( in quotation marks ) will be used whenever reference is made to the " subject pole " of experience . The quotation marks will be omitted when the pronouns refer to the empirical self .  | bipolar complex known as experience . One feature , however , is characteristic of this " I. " The " I , " as the " subject pole " of experience , is identical with what I have previously called " sign-consciousness . " That is to say , " I " am not only aware of something or take notice of it , " I " can also designate or refer to this something by means of " signs " or " words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of ) the " object pole " and can mean something through the instrumentality of " signs . " Hand in hand with " my " use of signs goes , finally , " my " discernment of discrete elements in the " object pole . " " I " can and do inspect the " content " of " my " first-person experience and " I " can and do " take notice " of various distinctions.2 THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF OBJECTIVITY As " I " examine the " object pole " of " my " first-person experience , " I " am aware of " thoughts , " " perceptions , " " feelings , " " desires , " and other so-called " objects . " " I " am aware of these " objects " in their variegated complexity and take notice now of " this " particular " object , " now of " that . " Let us assume that at this moment " I " take special notice of some one " object . " It may be a " patch of green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " square root of 2 . " But whatever it is , this " object " is an integral part of " my " first-person experience , and it is , it " exists " ? at least for " me . " Whether or not it possesses any other " being " is immaterial for the present . Within " my " experience the object " exists " in the sense of " being there " as something of which " I " am aware , of which " I " take notice . And as such a " something " it is self-identical ; it is a " this " to which " I " can attach a name . Now , once " I " have given " this " something a name , " I " have assumed a compelling obligation . Either " I " abandon all hope of attaining a rational and intelligible interpretation of experience , or " I " adhere to " my " identification of " this " object through this name . To put it differently : Either " I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaining knowledge about anything , or " I " employ " my " words throughout any given argument or analysis with an identity of meaning . That the alternatives are exhaustive and therefore compelling will readily be seen when a negative test is applied , that is , when the 2 This " inspection " must not be confused with " introspection " ; for it is actually an observation and analysis of the " object pole " and not an attempt to " look into " the functioning of the " subject pole . " The usual objections to introspection are therefore inapplicable to the inspective scrutiny of the contents of first-person experience .  | attempt is made to think , not only coherently and rationally , but to think at all , while the meaning of the terms employed is constantly being changed . We simply have no other choice : Either we give up thinking or we accept the self-identity of meanings , i.e. , the identification of " this " object as this , or of A as A. In the most elementary act of name-giving " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or must abandon thought . But as " I " single out " this " object from the rest of " my " experience , " I " separate it ( at least in thought ) from all other " objects . " That is to say , " I " can speak of " this " object only as distinguished from some other " object " ( or " objects " ) which " I " designate as " non-this " or as " that . " " This " is not " that . " A is not non-A . Again " I " have no choice in the matter . If " I " want to think at all , i.e. , if " I " accept the law of identity , " I " must accept also the " law of contradiction " ; for this law is in all essentials only the negative application of the law of identity . Once " I " have stipulated what a word shall mean , i.e. , once " I " have decided to which object ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object ( or kinds of objects ) it shall not refer , then any object of which " I " am aware is either of the kind designated by the word or it is of a kind not designated by the word . It is either " this " or it is " non-this . " It is either A or non-A . There is no third alternative . All " third " alternatives are excluded by the very nature of the stipulated meaning of the word in question . The " law of the excluded middle , " in other words , is likewise an inescapable condition of thought entailed by the acceptance of the law of identity . Our first steps in the analysis of first-person experience have thus led to most gratifying results . The traditional " laws of thought " have been uncovered as indispensable conditions of even the most elementary recognition of meanings . They are thus the sine qua non of all thinking . But they are also objectively compelling in the sense that we must accept them or cease thinking . And their validity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some external agent . However , these " laws of thought " stipulate purely formal requirements and conditions of thinking and , taken by themselves , are empty and barren . They are necessary but not sufficient for the complete integration of experience . An indispensable supplement to the laws in question may be found in the basic " categories " which permeate and give " texture " to experience .  | DIMENSIONS OF " OTHERNESS " As we have seen , taking notice of " this " particular content of experience involves at once and inescapably a discrimination between " this " and " non-this " or " that . " It involves , in other words , a recognition of an " otherness " and , therefore , an awareness of a basic relation . This relation of " otherness " requires further analysis . Red is " other than " green , and it is " other than " orange ; but is it " other than " green and orange in the same sense ? A color is " other than " a sound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odor ; but is it " other than " a sound , a taste , or an odor in the same sense in which one color is " other than " another color ? A sense datum is " other than " a feeling , " other than " a memory image , " other than " a desire ; but is the " otherness " in each case qualitatively the same ? Or is it not rather true that the qualitative characteristics of the elements of experience which are " other " specifically determine in each case the very nature of " otherness " itself ? " Otherness , " I believe , can not be understood when we regard it merely as " something common " to all cases of " being other , " as " something left " when we have abstracted from all specificalities of the concrete situation ; when we interpret it , in other words , as an abstract universal . On the face of it , the complexity which we encounter in the analysis of " otherness " is bewildering rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if concretely interpreted , the qualitative differences involved in " otherness " become a first principle of order . For example , the very fact that red is " other than " orange in a way which differs from that in which it is " other than " yellow or " other than " green , enables us to place these various colors in a strict sequence of gradations ? a sequence in which red fades into orange , orange into yellow , yellow into green , and so on . Similarly , the fact that sound A is " other than " sound B , in a way which is different from that in which it is " other than " sound C , makes possible the construction of a scale of sounds , A , B , C , ... Again , the fact that the intensity of a pain L is " other than " the intensity of a pain M in a way that is different from that in which it is " other than " the intensity of pain N , and so on , provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through a zero-point , finds its continuation in a scale of pleasure intensities . It is evident , therefore , that the well-differentiated manifoldness of " otherness , " positively interpreted , leads to specific sequences or  | dimensions and , therefore , to specific elements of order in " my " firstperson experience . This order is increased further when we realize that colors , sounds , tastes , odors , and other sensory qualities are " other than " feelings of pain or feelings of pleasure in a way which is different from that in which they are " other than " memory images and still " other than " hallucinations , or dream images , and so on . The " dimensions of otherness " previously referred to are now found to be interrelated in such a way that they constitute large " realms of othernesses . " The whole of experience is thus permeated with these elements of order . It stands revealed as a manifold of specific " contents " which is yet not a mere chaos of unrelated " elements . " First-person experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interlinked " dimensions of otherness . " If this is so , then certain basic categories , as the indispensable conditions of that order , can be found in first-person experience . We shall try to uncover at least some of them . BASIC CATEGORIES The difficulties involved in any analysis of categories are formidable and the history of philosophy furnishes no ready-made solution for our problem . Not that the question of categories has failed to interest philosophers in the past . Part of the trouble arises rather from the fact that since the days of Aristotle so many great thinkers have meant so many different things when they discussed " categories " that the overabundance of meanings is bewildering . Of one thing only can we be certain at this stage of our analysis , namely of this , that it is immaterial for the present whether the categories are primarily those of " real things " imposed upon the " mind " ( realism ) , or whether they are primarily those of the " mind " imposed upon the " things " ( Kantian idealism ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor " minds " which could impose categories . We are simply inspecting our first-person experience and are " taking notice " of what we find there . Our position at this time is antecedent to any metaphysical doctrine and is therefore " this side of " realism and idealism . However , the difficulties of our task arise in part also from conditions inherent in the very problem of " categories , " i.e. , in the very problem of basic and irreducible concepts . For one thing , we know of no " principle of deduction " ( such as the Kantian , for example ) by means of which a complete list of categories might be derived . We are confined in our search to the inspection of  | the stratified content of our first-person experience and to a discernment of categories in the midst of the variegated manifoldness of that content . There is no a priori approach to our problem . Whatever knowledge of categories we obtain must be evolved out of the bewildering complexity of immediate experience by a process of painstaking analysis and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that experience . Furthermore , the categories , once discovered , turn out to be so intimately interrelated that the meaning of one is fully understood only in interdependence with the meanings of all . Any " table " of categories is therefore an arbitrary arrangement . What we really uncover in our analysis is an integrated complex of categories , not individual categories or even " series " of categories . The table which follows must therefore be viewed with this idea in mind . It is at best only a tentative scheme which presents in linguistic separation ideas which are fundamentally inseparable . TABLE OF CATEGORIES The basic categories discovered in first-person experience may be arranged in pairs as follows : Quality ? Quantity Unity ? Manifoldness Form ? Matter Universal ? Particular Relation ? Substratum Dimension ? Opposites Continuity ? Discreteness These pairs and their interrelations require brief comments.3 ( a ) Quality ? Quantity. ? Of all the categories included in our table , the categories " quality " and " quantity " have received most attention in the past . This does not mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been removed . On the contrary , most discussions of these categories proceed from metaphysical assumptions which can as yet play no part in our analysis . The resolution of qualities into quantities , for example , so strongly suggested by mathematical procedures in the natural sciences , transcends the realm of immediate experience and presupposes a world of realities which , for us , is as yet a problem rather than an established fact . 8 For a radically different conception of the functions of categories see Nicolai Hartmann , Der Aufbau der realen Welt.  | In first-person experience , the dimensions of " otherness " disclose most clearly what is meant by " quality . " The experiential qualia red ( as red ) and green ( as green ) , and both as different from each other in color , disclose quality ; and so do bitter and sweet , sound and odor , warmth and pain , etc . And every one of these qualities is what it is in its experiential givenness , i.e. , it is self-identical and irreducible , and it differs from qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , implies self-identity and difference as indispensable aspects . But where there is difference , there is also quantity ; for there are at least two qualia , a this and a that , one and another , and there may be more . We must not infer from this , however , that quality is the prior category upon which quantity depends . The question of priority ( logical or otherwise ) is completely irrelevant to the interrelation of categories . The category of quantity is no more dependent upon the category of quality than is the latter upon the former ; for if there are two or more colors , two or more sounds , two or more tastes , two or more this and that , it is obvious that they must differ in quality . Every quantification implies a qualitative self-identity as well as a qualitative difference of the enumerated colors or sounds or tastes or " simples " of any type . Experientially , quantity is always a quantity of something ; and in the simplest cases it is a quantity of some quale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity implies the possibility of " counting . " It discloses the enumerative aspects of first-person experience and implies the idea of " so many . " But within the various dimensions of " otherness " the category of quantity also pertains to gradations of intensity and implies the idea of " so much . " Quantity , in other words , may be of an enumerative or of an intensive type . In either respect it becomes the basis of mathematical interpretations of experience , and in both respects it interpenetrates with the categories of continuity and discreteness without , however , fusing completely with either . ( b ) Unity ? Manifoldness.  --  Quality and quantity , intertwined as they are , are also inseparably interrelated with " unity " and " manifoldness . " On the face of it , the latter categories appear to be only forms of quantity ; but that this is not so becomes evident when we realize that unity and manifoldness are interrelated in a non-quantitative manner . After all , the " simples " of experience are but abstractions . Even elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of taste , or the like ? are , within limits , complex . The " patch of red " I  | am aware of is of this particular hue , of this particular shade , this particular intensity , this particular size , and this particular shape . It is a " manifold " of various characteristics . But as this particular patch of red it is also a unity of experience ? a manifoldness in unity , or the unity of a manifoldness . Quality is here as much involved as is quantity . But neither quality nor quantity , nor both together , fully explain unity and manifoldness . " Unity , " by itself and separated from manifoldness , is barren and empty ? a meaningless abstraction . " Manifoldness , " by itself and separated from unity , is an incoherent chaos and a hindrance to all understanding . Only the two together , supplementing and balancing each other , are at all significant . Only in their interrelation do they become key concepts for the integration of experience . If taken together , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " feelings " on up to " persons " and " historical events . " Whatever else any particular content of experience may be , it is at least a manifold in unity , a unity of the manifold . ( c ) Form ? Matter. ? In a sense , unity is form and manifoldness is the matter of a this ; or , rather , every form is essentially also a unity , and the manifoldness of a this provides the matter that enters into its specific form . Nevertheless , unity and form , and manifoldness and matter are by no means identical ; for form means not only unity of the manifold but also some specific arrangement of it , and matter implies not only manifoldness but something that is ( or may be ) arranged in specific ways . Matter , in the categorical sense , is , of course , not stuff of any kind . It is simply that which enters into form ; it is the counterpart to form , the residue we encounter when we break down a given form . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form is " matter " for some higher form , and that all matter is " form " of some lower matter . The " matter " of a particular patch of color , for example , is such and such a hue , such and such a shade , such and such an intensity , such and such size and shape . Its " form " is the specific combination of these " material " elements . For the experiential complex " rose , " however , this patch of color , in combination with other qualia , is " matter " ; the form is that of the " rose . " In a bouquet of flowers , the " rose " becomes " matter " and the form is that of the bouquet as a whole ; and so on . The variety of forms is inexhaustible . Moreover , not all forms are  | static . The form of a " living organism , " for instance , is a process form . The variety of matter is likewise inexhaustible . This follows from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Viewed superficially , it would seem that an analysis downward should sooner or later reveal the most basic , i.e. , the undifferentiated , form of matter ; but actually no such " matter " is ever encountered . A " sense-datum " is , after all , an entirely different " matter " than is a " dream image , " and a " dream image " than a " feeling of pain . " A color quale is matter of a different kind than is a sound quale ; red is a different matter than is green ; a light red other than a dark red ; the low intensity of a light tint different than a high intensity of the same tint ; and the intensity of a tint different than the intensity of an odor . No matter how far we push our analysis , the expected primary and undifferentiated matter still escapes us ; for , at each level , matter is simply that which requires further analysis , and the sequence of levels points in diverse directions . ( d ) Universal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may become a unit in enumeration ; but as unity of a manifold , the this is more than an enumerative unit . It is a " particular " ; i.e. , it is a particular " something " possessing specific qualitative characteristics . The " particular , " in other words , is distinguished not only by numerical singleness ( Thomas Aquinas ) but by qualitative uniqueness ( Duns Scotus ) as well . Every distinction of particulars involves differences in at least some of the characteristics ; and any two particulars which in all respects possess the same characteristics are identical with one another . They are one and the same particular . However , the " essence " of a particular , i.e. , its determinate nature , is not a particular essence but a " universal . " It exemplifies a class . Moreover , the elements of quality , quantity , unity , manifoldness , form , matter , space and time , etc. , which constitute the essence of the particular , are also all universals . Hence , as long as we take notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiential complexes we do not really encounter particulars ( cf. Blanshard ) . Particularity is the uniqueness which a this derives from an interpenetration of all its relations to the totality of all ( actual and possible ) phases and aspects of first-person experience . The particular , in other words , is comprehensible only as an aggregate of specific universals . Its individuality depends upon a relationally determinate structure of reality of such a type that within it at least some of the  | characteristics of the particular this can not possibly be shared by any other this . Not until we have full knowledge of this structure as a whole and of all its interrelations and ramifications can we know individuality . Until we attain such knowledge we can understand so-called particulars only by subsuming them under various aspects of universality . From this interrelation of universals and particulars stems the drive toward systemic completeness which characterizes all science and philosophy , and which is basic to our own attempts at integration ; for it is only the system as a whole which renders fully intelligible the " particulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , only " intersections " of diverse universals . ( e ) Relation ? Substratum. ? Where there is form , there are also relations ; and where there are relations , there must be substrata as the indispensable relata of the relations ; for it is obvious that relations can not be relations of relations ad infinitum . Sooner or later relations must involve something which is not just another relation ; and this " something " is what is meant here by a substratum . The substratum , of course , is not matter ; for matter , in the categorical sense , may consist of relations as well as of substrata . And least of all is the substratum " stuff " or " substance " ( either material or mental ) . Actually , every dimension of " otherness " has the character of a substratum ; for it is that of which a gradation is possible , that of which there may be more or less . The dimensions of space and time , of feelings , desires , sounds , colors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substrata ; for they are the indispensable correlates of relations . Relations are constitutive elements in experience ; for all structure is relational , and so is all context . Some relations may be " external , " i.e. , their existence or non-existence may not greatly affect the specific character of a this . Other relations are " internal , " i.e. , they are essential for the specific character of a this . The difference between external and internal relations , however , is by no means clear-cut and absolute . It is , rather , a matter of degree . For the individuality and complete uniqueness of a this , all relations within the whole of experience are indispensable and therefore " internal . " But for the practical purposes of science only relations of dependence are absolutely essential . All others may be regarded as " external . " Relations of some type are fundamental in all experience ; for experience involves context and context is a matter of relations . All isolation of instances is secondary and the result of an abstraction .  | Upon relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without relations there can be no unity of the manifold . At least three types of relations may be distinguished : ( 1 ) relations which constitute " permanent " experiential complexes ? such as are described by the " laws of nature " ; ( 2 ) relations which determine individuality ; and ( 3 ) relations which constitute broad realms of existence ? such as " nature , " " society , " " history , " etc . But this classification is suggestive rather than final ; for the analysis of relations is only in its infancy . ( f ) Dimension ? Opposites. ? The dimensions of " otherness , " so we have said , constitute substrata of various relations . This does not mean , however , that the category " substratum " is identical with " dimension " ; for the dimension is a correlate of " opposites " rather than of " relation . " Any pair of opposites ? such as light-dark , high-deep , pain-pleasure , love-hate , red-green , sweet-bitter ? defines a dimension ; and it does so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is important is merely the " polarity of direction " ; for such polarity is the essence of a dimension . In all measurements , and therefore in all mathematical interpretations of intensities , such dimensions of " otherness " are presupposed as the non-mathematical substrata . Length , duration , velocity , weight , etc. , are meaningless words without recourse to some substratal dimension ? Bridgman 's " operational definitions " notwithstanding . In actual experience the dimensions of " otherness " occur only in interdependent " systems " or " clusters . " In the case of a particular color quale , for example , the dimension of hues is interrelated at least with the two dimensions of shades and intensities , and probably with many more . Only through a process of abstraction can we therefore come to know a dimension all by itself and in complete isolation . The multi-dimensionality of experience provides the basis for diversified classifications ; for each classification rests upon a single dimension which has been selected relative to some specific purpose . The very fact , however , that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as when a patch of color is classified as to its hue or as to its brightness or as to its shape or size or position in space ? indicates the " intersecting " of various dimensions in this particular complex of experience . ( g ) Continuity ? Discreteness. ? Every dimension of " otherness " is a continuum and , as such , is subject to unlimited divisibility . Divisi-  | bility implies discreteness . Every dimension therefore also involves discreteness . Experientially , discreteness seems to be most prominent and to be also a direct contradiction of continuity . Nevertheless , all discernment of differences ( and such discernment is but the recognition of discreteness ) is possible only upon the basis of continuity . Continuity , therefore , while not directly " given " in first-person experience ? or " given " only within certain narrow limits ? is a logical implicate of discreteness . It is actually the conditio sine qua non of discreteness . And continuity and discreteness , far from being contradictories , are , in this fundamental sense , complementary categories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of limited " objects " ; but such " objects " are possible only because of the continuity of their constitutive relations within the whole of experience . SPATIALITY AND TEMPORALITY The categories which we have just discussed permeate the whole of first-person experience and provide the basic elements of order which make an integration and interpretation of that experience possible . They are the key concepts of intelligibility . Whatever theory of experience or of reality we ultimately develop , if it is at all adequate to the totality of first-person experience , it must make some reference to quality-quantity , unity-manifoldness , form-matter , universal-particular , relation-substratum , dimension-opposites , and continuity-discreteness . First-person experience , however , involves still further elements of order ; for the whole stratified content of that experience is characterized by an experiential temporality , and large parts of it are characterized , in addition , by an unmistakable spatiality . Those experiential contents , in particular , which furnish the basis for our belief in an " external world " are invariably " given " in a spatio-temporal " setting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relation and are therefore , in a sense , included in the categories of order . They are , however , relations of such specific and prominent kind that they deserve special consideration . And , furthermore , they involve other categories as well as the category of relations . They are definitely specific dimensions of " otherness " and , as such , are substrata rather than relations . They are qualitatively different and are subject to quantitative considerations . Each represents a unity of a manifold .  | Each is continuous and yet divisible ; it is universal and can yet be particularized , and so on . Spatiality and temporality , therefore , are on a logical level other than that of the categories . However , as found in first-person experience , spatiality and temporality must not be confused with " space " and " time " in any objective , i.e. , physical or metaphysical , sense . Objective space and objective time , as specific orders of " things , " are constructs involving much more than experienced spatiality and experienced temporality . Experientially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us to be " extended " and to be " placed side by side " ; and this is just about all that we can say about spatiality as " given " in first-person experience . The rest is interpretation and interpolation . The threedimensionality of " space , " its " objectivity , " its Euclidean or nonEuclidean character , its finitude or infinity , its homogeneity and infinite divisibility , and so on , are all matters involving highly developed mathematical and physical theories . But none of these theories would be particularly significant were it not for the primary form of spatiality under which some contents of experience are " given " to us . What is true concerning " space " and spatiality is true also with respect to " time " and temporality . Time , as an objective order of " before and after , " is a construct ; i.e. , it is the product of an interpolation of the temporality of experience . In first-person experience we may be aware of such and such a sound and also of such and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such a desire ; and we may be aware of them all " simultaneously " or in " succession . " Experientially , furthermore , some elements of the " object pole " may " endure " while others " change , " " come into being , " or " cease to be . " Whatever our theory of the " specious present " may ultimately be , experientially at least such temporal features as " duration , " simultaneity , " and " succession " are undeniably real . We hear snatches of " melodies , " not merely isolated tones ; and we see objects " in motion , " not merely as occupying a spatial position now here , now here , and now here . And such experiences as these would be impossible were it not for an experiential " carry-over , " for an experienced temporality which is not simply an unextended nowpoint . " Duration , " " simultaneity , " and " succession " characterize all our first-person experiences as they are " given " in the " specious present . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " succession " are beyond this  | experienced " present " is , however , a different matter and transcends the " givenness " of first-person experience . Is " simultaneity " absolute or relative ? Are successive " time-intervals " equal in duration or not ? Is " duration , " as such , a metaphysical reality ? Such questions can be answered only by elaborate theories based upon many and varied additional facts of experience ; for the nature of objective time is other than the nature of experienced temporality . Neither space nor time , in the objective sense , is directly " given " in first-person experience . Spatiality and temporality , however , are elements of order permeating the content of that experience , and they are supplementary to the categories previously discussed . THE PROBLEM OF THE " EXTERNAL WORLD " We are now in a position to tackle anew the problem of the " external world . " Our problem is this : Is it possible so to divide or classify the " objects " of our first-person experience as to obtain a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and another class of " objects " which , in addition to being such contents , also exist " out there " in an " external world " of self-sufficient " things " ? in a " world of things " such as the realist believes in ? The meaning of the term " out there " is as yet undefined and vague . It expresses primarily a certain feeling we have with respect to the " objects " in question , an " animal faith " in their existence as entities outside the knowledge relation . But unless this subjective " feeling " can be supplemented in some manner and can be supported by rational evidence , it falls far short of being an adequate criterion for the delimitation of the " external world . " Our problem is therefore to find a criterion ( or a set of criteria ) which will enable us to transform our " animal faith " into warranted belief , our blind trust into reasoned understanding or genuine knowledge , and which will yet be found exclusively in our own first-person experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seem to be also " things " of an " external world " are spatially extended and stand in spatial relation to one another . " I " " see " them as so broad and so high ; and " I " also " see " them side by side , above and below and to the right or to the left of one another . Spatiality , in the primary sense of an  | element of order , thus characterizes the objects of " my " experience which are also " things . " But spatiality alone is not sufficient as a criterion . The objects " I " dream about also have spatiality ; for " I " may dream about mountains and lakes , houses and trees , and landscapes of various forms . Afterimages , too , are so " broad " and so " high , " and the objects of " my " hallucinations may appear " side by side . " All objects of firstperson experience which are also " things " in an external world are indeed spatial ; but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , is a necessary , but not a sufficient , criterion of " things . " Now , the objects of experience which are regarded as " things , " in addition to being spatial , are also complex in the sense that they possess many attributes ; and their attributes are primarily of a special kind . They are the colors and shapes " I " " see , " the hardness and resistance to pressure " I " " feel , " the tastes " I " " savor , " the roughness or smoothness of surface and the hot or the cold which " I " experience . In brief , the attributes of these objects are primarily the so-called " sensory " qualities of experience . But " I " can not identify " things " and " sensory objects " without committing a logical fallacy . For if " I " consider only the experienced quale of so-called " sensory perception , " " I " must admit that hallucinatory objects and afterimages are not without observable qualia ; but still they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , " I " maintain that in " sense-perception " the quale is experienced only in the presence and because of the " things " of the " external world , " " I " assume the point at issue and argue in a circle . All " I " can say , therefore , at this point of my analysis is that wherever " I " deal with " things , " specific instances of color , sound , taste , fragrance , and so on , are involved ; but not every color " I " see , not every sound " I " hear , not every olfactory sensation " I " have , indicates the presence or the existence of a " thing . " The problem of " things " and their existence is much more difficult than appears at first glance . This much at least is certain : spatiality and " sensory " qualities alone are inadequate as criteria . THE EMERGENCE OF A " THING " Suppose now that " I " " eat an apple , " that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences which I ordinarily associate with " eating an apple . " " I " then " see " a specific combination of colors distributed over a roundish area ; " I " have " tactual " feelings of smoothness , and " kinesthetic " sensations of spatial expansion and  | of resistance to pressure ; and " my " visual and tactual experiences converge into a unique spatial pattern of distinct qualities . This pattern is further augmented by qualities of taste and fragrance , and by whatever else is qualitatively involved in " eating an apple . " All of these qualities , however , are distinct ; and all are , as qualities , independent of one another . The color is independent of the shape and , as color and shape , both are independent of the taste as well as of the fragrance and of all the other qualities . Nevertheless , all of these qualities are somehow integrated into a spatially extended and localized unity , and their togetherness constitutes the " apple " of " my " experience . The question is , What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities ? Assuredly " I " do not infer it from the rational ( or any other ) nature of " myself " as knower ; for " I " can not deduce " sweet " from reason , " round " from desire , " red " from emotion , or the togetherness of " sweet , " " round , " and " red " from the manifold interrelations of reason , desire , and emotion.4 Nor can " I " derive the integration of the qualities in question from the nature of those qualities themselves . It is true , of course , that wherever there is color there must also be shape ; and wherever there is shape there must be size . But such general interpenetration and interdependence of types of qualities have little , if any , bearing upon the specificality of the qualities which constitute the " apple . " No matter how hard " I " try , " I " can not infer from the specific nature of a taste that it must be associated with this particular color , with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or this feeling of warmth . When " I " encounter a certain shape , " I " have no way of telling in advance and from the nature of the shape alone what color it must be , just as " I " have no way of telling from the nature of a " given " red what taste ( if any ) is associated with it . In " my " first-person experience " I " may encounter the various qualities in different combinations , and in any specific case of integration " I " may discover new and unexpected aspects and variations of the different types of qualities . In every case , the specifically integrated unity of the diverse qualities is definitely determined for " me , " not by " me . " It is determined in a way which is beyond " my " control . 4 The " self , " incidentally , which reasons , which has desires , and which is the subject of emotions ? the empirical self as we ordinarily mean it ? is as yet as much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing " of the world about me.  | Only in view of this " givenness " of the integrated unity of qualities can ( and do ) " I " speak of an " apple " ( or of anything else ) as a " thing " " out there " in a " world about us . " Only in view of this " givenness , " too , do " I " speak of the " substantiality " of " things . " But to say that a " thing " ( the " apple " or whatever it is ) is that which possesses these qualities does not solve our problem ; for the " it " which is the " thing " in this sense is nothing apart from the qualities . If we think away all qualities , the " thing " itself , as the " it , " disappears . " It " exists only in the unitary combination of the various qualities . Nor will it do to argue that the bond establishing the experiential unity of qualities is a " common cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group the qualities together because we already know their common cause , or that the unitary complex of qualities is inescapably forced upon us by an as yet unknown common cause . If the first assumption is made , it is impossible to account for the fact that quite generally we group the qualities of a " thing " together as one complex unity long before we are able to conceive of them as the effects of one underlying cause . Or would you say that we already know the " common cause " of the fragrance , taste , color , and shape of an " apple " ? If the second assumption is made , we have no way of accounting for the fact that these and no other qualities are grouped together as constituting a " thing " because at any given moment of experience innumerable qualities of various kinds are " forced upon " us by many different " causes . " 5 In addition , the reference to a " common cause , " however this cause may be conceived , transcends the realm of immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of our analysis . How , then , do we know what qualities " belong together " as the experiential unity of a " thing " ? Several criteria must be considered . First and foremost among these is the " joint prominence " of the qualities in question . The size and shape and the color pattern of an " apple , " for example , are exactly coextensive and stand out together against a contrasting background . And the tactual qualities , the feeling of " smoothness " and of " resistance to pressure " are associated conspicuously with the size and shape and color ( cf. Blanshard ) . Since , in the case of most " things , ' ' ? tie intimate association of visual 6 Cf. B. Blanshard , The Nature of Thought , T , rlhaptsr tI.  | and tactual qualities is especially strong and can be experienced repeatedly and at will , we regard it as particularly characteristic of " things . " We forget that tactual and visual qualities belong to different dimensions of " otherness " and think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisting pressure , " and as " occupying the same space " as the color pattern . The " factors of configuration " ( as disclosed by Gestalt psychologists ) ? symmetry , simplicity , and Praegnanz of form ? also contribute to our experiential groupings of qualities ; for these factors favor certain types of pattern as against others , and they do so irrespective of " chance combinations , " " mechanical stimuli , " or " deliberate selections . " Where alternative groupings are possible , the Gestalt factors , as a rule , determine the outcome . Joint prominence and Praegnanz of form , however , imply as an indispensable condition that the association of qualities ( which is , experientially , the " thing " ) persist in time . This does not mean that the combination must " endure " for a long time ; but it does mean that it must be of sufficient " duration " in the specious present to be recognizable as a distinct configuration of qualities . No combination of qualities which does not fulfill this requirement can ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of all experiential complexes which are also " things " is the joint motion of their spatially intertwined qualities . That is to say , configurational complexes of qualities which move together as a unit are especially prominent as focal points of firstperson experience . They attract our attention much more than does the unchanging background of patterns and forms . They , therefore , even more than the unmoving configurations , provide the experiential basis for our conception of " things . " Such joint motion , furthermore , suggests a certain independence of the experiential complexes in question . " Things " may move , or remain at rest , contrary to " my " expectation or " my " desire . They may move in a way over which " I " have no control , and may " appear " or " disappear " in a manner which is no more deducible from the nature of the experiential qualities or from " my " own nature than is the specific combination of these ( and no other ) qualities in any " given " case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pattern in the specious present , common motion of the interrelated qualities , and a certain element of independence of the inte-  | grated whole ? such are the characteristics of the experiential complexes which are also " things " in the world about us . But we can not yet conclude that all experiential complexes possessing these characteristics are actually part of a " world about us " ; for we do not yet know what it means for anything to be a part of an " external " world . All that has been said so far concerning the particular characteristics of certain experiential complexes might well be true of the objects of our dreams and hallucinations as well as of the " things . " We must therefore augment the criteria just given so as to eliminate even the last elements of doubt . And this can be accomplished only by examining not isolated " things " but their interrelation and context ; i.e. , by examining the very meaning of " external world . " THE WORLD ABOUT US A moment ago we said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of " things . " This suggestion deserves further consideration . The reason for the particular prominence of the qualities of sight and touch is not difficult to find . The various colors seen at any time divide the visual field into distinct areas and provide the first demarcations for the delimitation of objects . The qualities of sight thus provide " me " with the first definite outline of what " I " come to regard as " things . " Then , too , " I " can see the shape which offers resistance to " my " touch , or " I " can see the " distance " which " I " also feel tactually . The qualities of sight and touch , in other words , are so interrelated that they supplement one another in a specific and direct way . Their respective " fields " overlap , and both together form the basis for " my " outward projection or " externalization " of the " things . " The co-ordination of visual , tactual , and kinesthetic qualities discloses , furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " me " to view these objects not only in their immediate spatiality but also as unitary complexes existing in threedimensional " space . " The attribution of " existence in space , " however , by itself and in the simple form just stated , is evidently inadequate as a criterion of the world about us ; for , while the objects of " my " dreams seldom possess the fixed order in space which " I " ascribe to " things , " it is at least possible to conceive dream experiences which , as far as their spatial order is concerned , equal " my " experience of " things . " If , in  | " my " dream , " I " " walk across " meadows or climb mountains , " I " may note perspective changes in " my " dream objects which correspond to the perspective changes which " I " would observe under similar conditions while " fully awake . " The fact that the " space " in which " I " encounter the objects of " my " dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " encounter the " things " of the external world does not in itself prove the " reality " of the latter and the " unreality " of the former ? although it may indicate the general direction which " my " argument must take if " I " am to justify " my " belief in an external world of real things . Now , the " things " in space which comprise the world about us are not merely spatially extended and spatially related ; they also occupy space . Each " thing " which is located in some part of space prevents other " things " from occupying the same part . If " thing " B is moved into a part of space occupied by " thing " A , then A must be pushed out of that part of space . If A remains where it is , then B can not move into that place . That is to say , by virtue of the fact that they exclude one another from the parts of space they themselves occupy , " things " " act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence which " things " have upon one another ? their incompatibility in the same part of space ? is , however , only one of the many relations between them which can be discovered . A " stone " exposed to the " sun " gets warm ; " fire " changes " wood " into " smoke " and " ashes " ; a " storm " uproots " trees , " and in the presence of " soil , " " moisture , " and " sunshine , " a " seed " develops into a " plant . " In all these instances " I " encounter relations which can not be deduced from merely " subjective " factors . They are not formal relations of logic or cognition , but are relations involving deeply the very nature of " things . " Only an analysis of the " things " themselves , therefore , can reveal their interdependence ; and , conversely , only an analysis of their interdependence can truly reveal the nature of " things " as things . " I " know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it changes " wood " into " smoke " and " ashes " ; " I " know what a " seed " is because " I " observe that , in the presence of " soil , " " moisture , " and " sunshine , " it develops into a " plant " ; and " I " understand what " hydrogen " is from observing what it will " do " in the presence of other " elements . " In general , " I " comprehend any given " thing " only by observing its various relations of interdependence with other things , " i.e. , by viewing it in a coherent and continuous context of interdependent complexes of experience . This context ? added to all  | the criteria previously mentioned ? distinguishes the " things " of the " external world " from all other objects of experience ; for this context is the very essence of the " external world " itself . The objects of " my " hallucinations and dreams simply do not fit into this context of interdependence and continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream will not buy the next morning 's breakfast , and the snakes seen during delirium tremens do not disturb a blade of grass in the world of " things . " Nor can " I " transport myself from the space of " things " into the " fluid " spaces of dream objects by a continuous motion in some particular direction ? not even in principle is this possible . The " transition " from the space of " things " into the spaces of dream objects can be accomplished only by changing the status of " my " experience itself , i.e. , by falling asleep and dreaming . Of course , if " my " various dreams ( or hallucinatory experiences ) were such as to constitute one coherent and continuous pattern of interrelated events , while " I " would always " awaken " in a new and strangely disorderly environment , there would be no reason why " I " should regard " my " dreams as " dreams " and not as segments or parts of a " real " world . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my " hallucinations ) should reveal throughout the same coherency , continuity , and interdependence which " I " observe in the case of real things , " I " should have to ascribe to them the same type and degree of reality which " I " ascribe to " things . " " Fact " and " fancy " would in that case be as indistinguishable for " me " as they are for some primitive men , for children , and for lunatics . When we come right to the point , we discover that continuity and coherency of context and a mutual interdependence of the " things " are the only criteria which enable us to delimit the world about us and to exclude from that world the objects of dreams and fancies . If this criterion fails , we have no other . The situation , however , is most encouraging ; for " my " dreams and hallucinations are discontinuous and incoherent in their sequences , and the objects of these dreams and hallucinations do not form a pattern or context of interdependent events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal ever anew the essential interdependence of the " things " of the external world and disclose the coherency and continuity of the pattern of " things . " Every advancement in science produces new evidence of this context and gives " me " new assurance that the objects of " my " dreams and the objects of " my " hallucinations are not part of the pattern called  | " nature . " The better " I " understand this pattern , and the more fully " I " grasp its coherency , the easier it is for " me " to exclude the objects of dreams and hallucinations and of other normal or abnormal " fancies " from the realm of " things . " " THINGS , " " CONSTRUCTS , " AND THE PATTERN The pattern of " things " which is the world about us is , in a measure , discernible in first-person experience . Were it not so , we should never know anything about an " external " world . This does not mean , however , that the pattern of " things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole , as the object of an immediate awareness . On the contrary , the pattern itself is only an " implicate " of the various elements of order which characterize first-person experience . While its broad outlines may be fairly obvious , its details and ultimate structure can be uncovered only through painstaking analyses and through careful adjustments and interpolations of diverse traces or fragments of order . However , adjustments and interpolations of immediate experiences are involved from the very moment we begin to regard certain complexes of interdependent qualities as " things " ; for even simple " things " are not " given " in their entirety at any one moment of awareness . The " sheet of paper , " for example , which " I " now see has " another side " which " I " do not see at this time ; and the " apple " has an " inside " which is not " given " in experience as long as " I " see only its " surface . " In any experience of " things , " therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " elements , or interpretative judgments , are involved . The relative proportion of " given " elements and interpolative judgments varies from case to case . When " I " merely identify some complex of visual and tactual qualities as being a " piece of paper , " comparatively little interpolation is involved . If , on the other hand , " I " identify a luminous patch in the sky as " Encke 's comet , " interpolative judgments predominate ; for such an identification can not be made without recourse to astronomical theories concerning the nature and orbital motions of comets , nor without referring to the specific characteristics of Encke 's comet . If I hold a burning match to a " piece of paper , " the paper will also burn . " I " can observe how the flame " consumes " the paper until nothing is left but a bit of " ashes . " Before my very eyes , so to speak , the qualitative complex " paper " is gradually transformed into a quite different qualitative complex " ashes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the specious present , this transition . But suppose now that after setting the " paper " on fire I leave the room or close my eyes or keep in some other way from observing directly what is going on . If , after a while , I look again at the place where " I " last saw the burning " paper , " " I " now see some " ashes " instead of the " paper . " Remembering " my " earlier experience of observing the transition from " paper " to " ashes , " " I " now interpolate " my " new observations and maintain that , even when " I " was not aware of the process of burning , the transition from " paper " to " ashes " went on as before . " I " justify this interpolation ( and others like it ) as contributing to the orderliness of the over-all pattern of " things , " i.e. , as contributing to the continuity and coherence of that pattern and to the schema of interdependent " things " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " external world . " The same line of reasoning leads to the stipulation that there exist " things " of which " I " am in no way directly aware at this time but which are " potential " objects of experience for " me . " The " Grand Teton , " the " Nebraska State Capitol , " the " book on the desk at home , " the " engine in my car , " and a myriad of other " things " belong at this moment to the class of " potential " objects ( as distinguished from " things " which are now actually present in " my " experience ) . The pattern of " things " as a whole would be different from what it is were these unobserved " things " to be ruled out as non-existent . And what is true in the case of unobserved " things " which yet may become objects of direct experience , is true also in the case of those " things " which belong to the historical past , i.e. , of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The pattern of " things " as a whole , and as " I " interpolate it at present , would be different from what it is if its continuity and interdependence did not imply the past reality of the now-non-existent " things . " It is again the pattern of " things " which entails their previous existence . Finally , for the sake of order and in the interest of the pattern of " things , " " I " may find it necessary to introduce certain " constructs " as indispensable supplements to ( potentially ) observable " things . " The demands for continuity of the pattern and for a thoroughgoing interdependence of " things " may ( logically ) compel me to include " fields of force , " " atoms , " " electrons , " " energy levels , " " phase waves , " and other non-observable " entities " in the pattern of " things " ; for without such " constructs " the order of first-person experience would remain haphazard , fragmentary , and limited in scope and validity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , which ultimately determines what shall and what shall not be included in the world of " things . " We have , however , no a priori knowledge of the nature of the pattern in its completeness . We can only construct it on the basis of the fragments of order encountered in first-person experience . And it is this fact which makes the task of scientists and philosophers hazardous and difficult ; for in our interpolation of experience we must imaginatively anticipate what the pattern might be , and then , turning about , we must interpret and integrate our experience in the light of that anticipated pattern . Only a painstaking process of critical readjustments of our interpolations and applied patterns over a long period of time can ever assure us of ultimate success , i.e. , of discovering a pattern which will integrate the whole of experience without contradictions and gaps , and which will fully account for all " things " as indispensable elements of the pattern itself . MY SELF So far we have been concerned almost exclusively with the " object pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole . " This " subject pole , " however , the " I " of first-person experience , also requires interpretation ? especially since various questions concerning it must already have arisen in the reader 's mind . It will be remembered that we started out at the beginning of this chapter with the statement that " I " am the " focal point " of " my " firstperson experience , that the objects of this experience are all somehow related to " me , " and that nothing which is not found in " my " firstperson experience or is not in some way related to it can become known to " me . " Throughout our discussions we have used the grammatical symbols of the first person singular to refer to the subject pole of first-person experience , and we have employed quotation marks to indicate that nothing but the subject pole was intended . But this reference to " I , " " me , " and " my " has unavoidably suggested a simplicity and singularity of the designatum which is far from the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which now hears a particular sound the same " I " which yesterday experienced the pain of a " toothache " and which the day before yesterday dreamed about a sojourn to Antarctica ? Is the " I " which experiences pleasure and desires some particular object still the same " I " which perceives and thinks , which hopes and regrets ? Is the " I , " as such , something which persists in time , a unitary entity  | which endures in the midst of all change ? Or is it a sequence of everchanging combinations of awarenesses , a " bundle of distinct perceptions , " as Hume maintained ? The dimensions of " otherness " imply that the " I , " whatever it may ultimately turn out to be , is experientially correlated with diverse types of qualities . " I " see colors and shapes ; " I " hear sounds ; " I " taste flavors , smell fragrances ; " I " feel warmth and , in a different sense of the word feel , ' " I " feel pain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I " anticipate the future and recall the past ; and " I " have other modes of experience as well . It is easy to infer from these facts that the " I " which has all of these experiences is but a specific collection or set of events and has no existence apart from and beyond these various awarenesses themselves ; that , as a matter of fact , there is no enduring " I , " but only the sequence of interrelated experiences as such . I believe , however , that this " serial theory " of the " I , " plausible as it may seem at first glance , entails insurmountable difficulties and that it must be abandoned if a really coherent integration of firstperson experience is to be achieved .6 To begin with , let us suppose that " I " see a color or hear a noise or desire an apple or believe a proposition or have any other kind of experience . In other words , let us assume that " I " am aware of " something " as a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each instance of " being aware of something " I call a " mental event " ? using the term " mental " as indicating the nature sui generic which distinguishes an " awareness " from a physical " thing , " but without committing us to any metaphysical theory of " mind . " If this terminology be accepted , then it is tautological to say that wherever and whenever " I " experience anything , " mental events " occur ; for " being aware of something " is equivalent , on the side of the subject pole , to the " occurrence of a mental event . " My contention is that wherever there is an " I , " there occur " mental events " either in sequence or in simultaneous correlation or , as a rule , in a complex interrelation of sequence and correlation . Moreover , wherever there exists such a sequence and correlation of " mental events , " there will also be found a " biography , " i.e. , a set of " mental events " so interrelated that " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it was " I " who had such and such other experiences before . ' It should be noted that our criterion of evaluation is once more the ideal of a coherent pattern of interdependence , and one which is in harmony with the pattern of the world of " things . " No other criterion can be found .  | Any theory of " self " must give an adequate interpretation of both , the complex interrelation of " mental events " and the " biography " of the " I " ; and this the " serial theory " fails to do ( cf. Gallie ) . But let me be more specific . In the first place , every " mental event " is essentially complex and relational : " I " am aware of " something " ? be it a sound , a color , a dream-image , or a " thing . " A " mental event , " in other words , consists of a relation between " something " and " something else . " Now , we know from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately be substrata of some sort rather than merely other relations . We know , furthermore , that the object-side of the awareness-relation is constituted by the various dimensions of " otherness , " by the different qualia and by " things . " But what constitutes the subject pole ? In view of the nature and interrelation of categories , the subject pole can not consist of relations alone but must involve a substratum of some kind . We can let it go at that , for the present . Let us consider next the fact that the " serial theory " of the self assumes that there exist or occur particular " mental events " and that different " mental events " are interrelated in complex series , thus constituting the " I. " Two questions are in order : ( 1 ) What is a particular or single " mental event " ? ( 2 ) What justification is there for maintaining that the " biography " of the " I " involves nothing but a collection of such events ? Turning to the first question , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snatch of melody or see a " piece of paper " burn to " ashes . " Is either of these experiences a single " mental event " ? Clearly , the flickering of the flame and the crumbling of the paper as it turns black could be broken down into distinct sequences of specific experiences which differ from moment to moment as the burning proceeds . Each momentary experience involves a substratum on the subject-side ; but would you contend that each involves a different substratum ? If so , how can we account for the fact that the burning of the paper or the snatch of melody is experienced also as a unitary whole occurring in the specious present ? Does this involve a still different substratum , one which overlaps all the others and is yet not identical with them ? Is there no escape from the multiplicity of substrata ? Does the infinite divisibility of an experience in time imply an infinity of " I 's " as the substrata of the infinite number of " instantaneous " experiences thus creatable ? Or does it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold that the temporal and qualitative  | continuity of specific experiences has as its correlate one single substratum which persists in time ? Let us assume next that " I " see the colored shape of an " apple " at the same time that " I " feel its resistance to pressure and the smoothness of its surface . Is the " I " which sees also the " I " which feels ? Is the experience involving such diverse qualities as those of sight and touch correlated with one " I " or with several ? If we assume that it is correlated with several , how can we account for the fact that the complex experience is yet unitary and is simply an experience which " I " have ? Are the manifold experiences of any one moment correlated with different substrata , although experientially and despite all manifoldness all of them belong to " my " " biography " ? Or does the experiential unity of awareness imply one unitary substratum as the center of that " biography " ? Add to the manifoldness of experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , the great variety of " past " experiences of which " I " am aware , which " I " recall , and which are also constituent elements of " my " biography , " and you will find that the " serial theory " of the self encounters still further difficulties ; for no causal theory ( in the Humean sense ) can explain the experiential self-identity , the " unity of consciousness , " which makes " me " recognize " my " own past . For one thing , the continuity of " my " experience is not interrupted . " I " sleep nights or , at times , " lose consciousness " altogether . But after such disruption of the chain of " my " experiences , " I " still retain " my " self-identity , and " my " " biography " continues as the unitary " biography " of this , and no other , " I. " Whatever unconscious " mental events " " I " may assume as filling the gaps , they can be but " posits " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I " am fully aware . After all has been said and done , the continuity of " biography " as disclosed in " my " first-person experience , remains unintelligible without the assumption of a corresponding continuity of the substratum in which it is centered . No matter , therefore , from what angle we approach the problem , the insufficiencies of the " serial theory " suggest strongly that only a " substratum theory " can account for the nature of the self ( cf. Gallie ) . For the present it is sufficient to have made this point . How the substratum of the self is to be conceived and interpreted and how it is related to the " things " of the " external world , " to " material substances " and their interactions ? these are problems which may well  | be left for later considerations , just as the nature of " things " must be considered at a later time . Some general remarks , however , may still be in order . ( a ) As is clear from the discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself imply " substance " or " stuff . " Our repudiation of the " serial theory " does not commit us to a doctrine of " mind-stuff " or to a materialistic interpretation of the self . ( b ) All " mental events , " as elements in a specific " biography , " are " private " to that " biography . " That is to say , " my " experiences stand to " me " in a relation of intimacy which makes them strictly " mine . " The color " I " see , the sound " I " hear , the emotion " I " feel , the thought " I " think can be experienced , directly and immediately , only by " me . " " I " am aware of them . But " you " or " anybody else " can know only about them , indirectly and " externally , " and only if " I " in some way inform " you " about them ( cf. Montague ) . ( c ) As a self " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i ) " I " experience a succession of events in the " specious present " ; and ( ii ) " I " carry with " me " the past as an enduring " biography . " " I " experience myself in both respects as an enduring self . ( d ) As an enduring self " I " am also organizing , arranging , and integrating into coherent systems the various fragments of order which " I " find in " my " first-person experience ; and ultimately " I " am aiming at one all-inclusive and perfectly integrated system . " My " scientific and philosophical activities have here their roots , and " my " practical living presupposes at least some measure of success in " my " process of integrating the objects of " my " experience . ( e ) The integration " I " aim at necessitates an anticipation of the future ; and as enduring self " I " transcend in " my " imagination the past and the present and posit " goals " which " I " try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what " I " do is permeated with purpose . Hence , whatever else " I " may be , as a self " I " am at least enduring , integrating , and purposive . Such , at any rate , is a reasonable interpolation of what " I " experience directly of " myself " in " my " own first-person experience . We can , however , go a step further . MY BODY AND THE PATTERN OF " THINGS " Among the things constituting the coherent and continuous pattern , and interwoven with them in the context of interdependence , there exists one " thing " which is of special significance to " me , " namely ,  | my own body . This body occupies space just as any other thing , and it interacts with the things . It prevents other things from occupying the same space which it occupies at any given time ; and as it presses against things they are pushed out of the places they occupy or are modified in shape or size . In turn , however , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them for its proper functioning and its very existence . The " tissues " of my body are composed of the very same types of elements which constitute the rest of the bodied world , while the " food " I eat and the " air " I breathe are but parts of the pattern of things . There can be no doubt about it ; my body is one of the things in the realm of things , and is interdependent with the whole pattern . My body , however , stands also in a specific and unique relation to " me " as the knower . Only if my eyes are open do " I " see the things of the external world ; only if my finger touches a hot stove do " I " feel the pain ; and only if my body moves about do " I " observe the characteristic perspective changes in the realm of things . In brief , all contents of " my " experience which pertain to the pattern of things depend in some way on the presence and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of my body " I " can do so only through the employment of some other part of that same body . Destroy part of my body , and you encroach upon " my " experience , for you eliminate from " my " experience all those qualitative contents which depend upon that part for their occurrence . Anesthetize my whole body , and " my " experience as a whole ceases . My body , therefore , is an indispensable condition of " my " experience . " My " experience depends upon it and upon its functioning . My body thus occupies a unique position . On the one hand , it is part of the pattern of things . In fact , it depends for its very existence upon that pattern and upon its own interaction with it . On the other hand , my body is an indispensable condition of " my " experience . " My " experience depends upon it . " My " experience , however , is real . It is . It is the only occurrence of which " I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying of " my " own experience is but a further demonstration of its reality . Now , something real can not possibly depend upon something non-real as its indispensable condition . My body , therefore , as an indispensable condition of " my " experience , must be at least as real as " my " experience itself ; and the pattern of things , which is the indispensable condition for the existence of my body , must be as real as  | my body . " I " can therefore affirm at long last that the pattern of things which I call " nature " or " world about me , " in all its coherency and continuity , is as real as I am , and that it is in the same sense in which I assert reality of my body . The " trees " here and the " mountains " yonder are as real as I am , as real as my bodied self . A more profound reality I can not attribute to anything. ? The objects of " my " dreams and hallucinations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no place in the pattern of things . OTHER PERSONS AND THE WORLD ABOUT US Among the " things " of the external world , and woven into their pattern of interdependence , are bodies like my own . They interact with the things very much in the way I do ; and , from their movements , from their reactions and expressions , from their " words " and " deeds , " " I " infer that they are embodiments of other focal points of experience , that they are living , sentient , thinking beings ? such as " I " know myself to be . Although in many of my contacts with them " I " know my " fellow men " only as centers of bodily behavior ( just as " I " know " stones , " " trees , " and " birds " ) , occasions arise again and again when that behavior bespeaks the presence of an inner directing " agency " which " I " can conceive only in analogy to myself as a knower . On such occasions " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . " " I " can imagine their thoughts , their feelings , and their desires , and can thus comprehend them as minds . Such " inference by analogy , " however , is not the only , nor even the most important , way in which " I " know my fellow men as centers of first-person experience . My contact with them provides much more direct and much more convincing evidence ; for " I " can communicate with my fellow men . We exchange ideas . We understand one another . We raise and answer questions and discuss problems of various kinds . And such communication , as we have seen earlier , is possible only upon the presupposition of a " mutuality of minds . " In and through the dialectic of communication and discussion the " other person " stands revealed as being what " I " am ? an enduring , integrating , and purposive center of first-person experience . Perhaps all this is faith ? but if so , it is faith not in " my " own 7 Fundamentally this seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy of Heidegger and Jaspers . Cf. W. H. Werkmeister , " An Introduction to Heidegger 's Existential Philosophy , ' " Philosophy and Phenomenological Research , II , 1941 , 79-87.  | whims and wishes , but in the basic orderliness of the world , and in the coherency and continuity of the pattern which constitutes that world . It is no longer mere " animal faith " but a reasoned and warranted belief which finds unquestionable verification in our daily living . If my fellow men were mere delusions of " my " mind , and if they were no more real than are the objects of dreams , much of the pattern of the world would be disrupted and its coherency shattered . There would then be no accounting for the existence of houses and cities and motorcars , and no explanation for books and pictures and musical compositions . All " human productions " would have to be eliminated from the world of things , and the pattern of that world would be incomplete . The attack upon the thesis that " other minds " exist follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviorist is forced to deny their existence because he denies , in principle , the existence of mind altogether ? including that of his own mind . But the radicalism of this position impairs the argument itself ; for , in conformity with his theory , the behaviorist must regard himself as nothing but a system of bodily behavior-patterns and , as such a system , he can not cognize or theorize about anything . Cognition and theorizing presuppose " mind " at least in the form of symbol-consciousness ; for meaning itself is impossible without this . But if the behaviorist must admit that at least he himself is a knower , a " mind " in the sense of symbol-consciousness , then the principle upon which his argument against " other minds " rests breaks down and his argument itself becomes inconclusive . ( 2 ) The solipsist also denies the reality of " other minds " ; but he asserts at least the existence of his own mind . His argument derives all its force from the so-called " egocentric predicament , " i.e. , from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very specific sense " private " to that knower and therefore inaccessible to anyone else . " Other minds , " so the argument now runs , do not and cannnot exist in the world of " my " experience because they ( and their experience ) are " inaccessible " to " me . " The force of this " argument , " however , is more apparent than real ; for there is nothing in the nature of a given experiential content which would prevent this content from becoming part of anybody 's experience . That " I " am aware of it rather than " you " ( or vice versa ) is due to circumstances which are contingent to the nature of the content as such and can not be inferred from the content itself . If " I " see a particular red or hear a particular sound , there is nothing in the quale of the red or the quale of the sound which  | would preclude the possibility of its ever being seen or heard by somebody else . But if this is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first-person experience ? genuine though it be in one sense ? is not such that it eliminates in principle the hypothesis of the existence of " other minds . " The solipsist 's argument , therefore , does not impair our thesis . But if " other persons " exist as experiencing , thinking minds , then their reality casts new light upon " my " conception of things " out there " ; for now " many " persons may have parallel experiences of the " same " things . Our experiences may overlap in a determinable way and may augment one another . If " I " see a " book " and locate it as " here " by touching it with my hand , " you " may also see a " book " which you locate tactually in the same place in which I locate the book " I " see ; and , from the description of what we see and feel , we discover the interrelation of our experiences ? their basic parallelism . A thousand persons may " see " the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " same " solar eclipse , and the mutual corroboration of their respective experiences will be a welcome supplement to " my " criteria of the things which constitute the world about us . When " my " own observations are interrupted by sleep or death or in some other way , " other persons " can carry on and can see the pattern of the world in uninterrupted continuity . In order to account for this parallelism of experience we must either resort to the doctrine of a " pre-established harmony " according to which all human beings were " predetermined " in their inner constitution to have " parallel " experiences at the " proper " times ; or we must admit that the things " out there " really are out there ? that they transcend " my " consciousness and " yours " and that of every other finite being , and that they have a reality and an existence of their own . The former alternative not only taxes our credulity to the limit but can be shown to lead to various contradictions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural " and free from contradiction . It is really the only one which is reconcilable with the thesis that the world about us is the indispensable condition for the existence of an indispensable condition ( our body ) of our own firstperson experience . INTERPRETING THE PATTERN The thesis that the things which constitute the pattern of the world have an existence which transcends any particular first-person expe-  | rience does not imply that the things or their patterns can be described or understood in terms other than those of human experience . When the astronomer predicts a lunar eclipse , he means that if we observe the " moon " at the specified time , we shall have all the visual experiences characteristic of a " lunar eclipse , " and that if it were possible for us to observe the predicted event from some point outside our solar system , we would find three numerically distinct bodies , the " sun , " the " earth , " and the " moon , " in specific spatial relations to one another . This " constellation " of celestial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were here to observe it , but we can speak about it and can understand it only in terms which derive their meaning from human experience . How else would we know what it means to say , " three bodies in a specific constellation " ? When , on the basis of " historical data , " we reconstruct past events ? such as Caesar crossing the Rubicon or the formation of the Rocky Mountains ? then this reconstruction , too , must be given in terms of human experience . What we mean to say is that if we had lived during the time of Caesar we could have observed his troops in the process of crossing the river ; or , if we had lived during the proper geological age , we could have observed the upheaval of the American continent which resulted in the formation of the Rockies . Our interpretation of present experiences , or experiential contents here and now before us , may lead to a description and interpretation of things and events far away in space and in time , but we understand those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Things " and " events " which can not be so understood or which can not be connected , indirectly at least , with our experience , can not be understood at all , and reference to them is meaningless . First-person experience and the integration of that experience into a coherent and continuous pattern of interdependency are our only cues to reality and our only means of its comprehension . They are the sole basis of science and philosophy . But let us approach the matter from a different angle . CATEGORIES OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD In an earlier section of this chapter we have discussed briefly the categories which permeate the whole of first-person experience and contribute to its order . It is evident , however , that these , the most general , categories are not sufficient for an interpretation of the world about us . The order of that outer world depends upon additional categories , i.e. , it depends upon categories which are consistent with , and related to , the categories already discussed , but which , neverthe-  | less , involve aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these additional categories are the following pairs : Harmony ? Incompatibility Inner ? Outer Determination ? Dependence Element ? Structure As before , each pair of these categories constitutes a categorical complex ; and the four pairs together form a system of closely interrelated categories . The meaning of any one of these categories , therefore , entails them all ( cf. Hartmann , 1940 ) . ( a ) Harmony ? Incompatibility. ? The meaning of these two categories must not be confused with " consistency " and " contradiction " ; for the latter concepts pertain to thought and the logical relation of ideas , whereas the categories here under consideration pertain to the world of things and to the interrelation of things . " Contradiction , " to be sure , is also a form of " incompatibility , " but it is an incompatibility of ideas , not of things . And " consistency " is a form of harmony ; but it is not a harmony or compatibility of things . Incompatibility , in the realm of things , means an opposition of " forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interference of one thing with another . And harmony means that despite this conflict and struggle the world of things does not burst asunder but endures . Individual things may be destroyed in the clash of conflicting forces , but the world as a whole remains . Actually , the incompatibility of things and forces , and the conflict and struggle which this involves , constitute the dynamic aspects of a world which , in a deeper sense , is yet one . The very oneness of that world bespeaks a fundamental harmony which transcends all conflict . Were it otherwise , the " world " of things would be chaotic and would not be a world at all . If a thing , A , occupies a certain space , another thing , B , can not occupy the same space at the same time . One thing thus " repels " another . But every action produces an equal and opposite reaction , and actions and forces are balanced in dynamic equilibria . Any shift in the balance reveals the conflict of forces . It " liberates " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new harmony has been achieved . Whether we examine the physical realm proper or the sphere of human relations , the interdependence and the dynamism of incompatibility and harmony are clearly discernible . They are that which makes the world of things a " going concern . " ( b ) Inner ? Outer. ? In a sense it is obvious that any three-dimen-  | sional thing has an " outside " and an " inside , " a " surface " and an " inner core . " But in this sense the relation of " inner-outer " is of little significance ; for the " inner core " is a vague and obscure " something " which always escapes us as we try to observe it . We can see and touch " outsides " and " surfaces " only . A more significant aspect of the relation of " inner-outer " will be encountered when we raise the question of the " external " world as such . In what sense is that world really " external " ? An obvious answer is , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being outside my body . " But this can hardly be the whole story ; for " my " body itself is part of the " external " world and is " external " to " me . " " My " experiences , although dependent upon my body , constitute an " inner core " of " mental events " of which the body is not a constituent part . On the other hand , however , " my " actions in the world about me can be effected only through my body ; and in this sense my body is the outward manifestation of " my " will . " I " decide to pick up a book ; my arm reaches out ; my hand takes hold of the book ; my body executes " my " decision . Here , then , is an " inner core " ? " my " will ? which " I " experience , as it were , from the " inside " in a dynamic rather than a spatial sense , but which becomes effective in an " outer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in this sense , I believe , that " outer " and " inner " are of categorical significance in the world about us . In the physical world , the " inner core " of a thing may be seen in the dynamic equilibrium of forces , of opposed stresses and strains , of balanced actions and reactions ; while the " outer " manifestation is the relatively stable constellation in space . Atoms and molecules have an " inner " and " outer " in this sense , and so have planetary systems and galaxies . At the level of plant and animal life the inseparable interrelation of a dynamic " inner core , " in the sense of opposing yet partially balanced " forces , " and an " outward " manifestation in space of the bodied whole is perhaps even more strikingly evident than it is at the level of inorganic things . And still more apparent is it where human beings , " persons , " are involved . The whole complex of feelings , urges , desires , instincts , and volitions constitutes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body 's existence . The aspects of " inner " and " outer " are , finally , also encountered at the social level . They may be discerned in connection with " institutions , " " social groups , " " society as a whole , " or whole " cultural  | eras . " Wherever there is a " going concern " of social living , there we also find the " inner " dynamics of opposing forces , and the " outer " manifestations of changing balances and equilibria . The categories " outer-inner , " therefore , permeate the whole " external " world and all of its " things . " ( c ) Determination ? Dependence. ? Our criterion of the external world has been , and is , the coherency and continuity of the pattern , and the interdependence of things . The categorical complexes " harmony-incompatibility " and " outer-inner " describe specific phases of the patterned interdependence but do not adequately express the element of " necessity , " which is characteristic of the interrelation of things . This " necessity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutually complementary categories " determination " and " dependence . " As here understood , i.e. , as categories of the external world , determination and dependence do not designate the logical relation of implication but refer rather to the various factual relations of things as things . They do designate relations , however ; and primarily relations of the " sequential " type . The bipolarity of the relation indicates that we are here dealing with a specific dimension of order which is constitutive in the world about us . The categorical complex " determination-dependence " implies that the things of the external world do not exist in supreme independence of one another , that they do not merely co-exist in space or succeed one another in time , but that one thing exists because of another and through the efficacy of that other . The relation , in other words , is of a dynamic character . One relatum is the " determining " factor , the other the " dependent " one ; and the two belong together in a sequence of existing things . " Determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this unitary relation as viewed from opposite directions . It is relatively simple to discover in any given situation which is the dependent thing . It is rather difficult , however , in most cases to specify the determining relatum ; for , as a rule , the determining factors are complex and varied . What , for example , is the determining factor when in the presence of soil , moisture , and sunshine an " acorn " grows into an " oak tree " ? That the " oak tree " is somehow dependent upon all the factors mentioned seems certain . It is in every respect a dependent being . But the more we succeed in analyzing the factors upon which the " oak tree " depends ( for its nature as well as for its  | existence ) , the more we are impressed by the complexity of these factors and by the intricacy of their interrelations . The simplest form of the " determination-dependence " relation has commonly been called causality . It is exemplified by the " push " type of influence which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination " and " dependence " are closely interlinked with the spatial incompatibility ( or " impenetrability " ) of things , and form the basis of all strictly " mechanistic " relations involving the passage of time . Of a somewhat different type is the " determination-dependence " relation encountered in all forms of interactions in which the time element is irrelevant . Gravitational attraction exemplifies this type ; but it is also discernible as the " binding force " in molecules and as the " inner core " of dynamic equilibria . In the realm of organisms ( both plant and animal ) , the individual chains of " determination-dependence " are , furthermore , integrated in such a way as to constitute " teleological " complexities in which the " whole " determines the function and the fate of each " part . " The character of this " organismic " relation may well be regarded as constituting an additional type of determination . ' Finally , at the human level , the " organismic " type is supplemented by a " determination-dependence " relation which involves " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every one of these types of the " determination-dependence " relation involves its own problems and provides its own difficulties of analysis . But such detailed matters can not be discussed at this time . Nor can we settle here the question whether or not all of these types are ultimately reducible to some one type ; and if so , what that type is . It suffices at this time to have separated the various types from one another and to have identified them as constitutive elements in the pattern which is the external world . We said a moment ago that the " determination-dependence " relation implies an element of " necessity . " This statement must not be misunderstood . Any attempt ( such as the Humean ) to derive this " necessity " empirically must come to naught ; for the " necessity " here referred to is of a categorical nature and therefore non-derivable . It is an indispensable presupposition for our understanding of that pattern of things which constitutes the world about us . After all , we have knowledge of an external world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " determination-dependence " relation , and because some of the objects of our first-person experience can be subsumed under this  | " necessity " ; but we do not derive , by empiricist abstraction , the idea of necessity from a world of things antecedently known to us . The Kantian argument is here irrefutable . ( d ) Element ? Structure. ? The things of the external world , as semi-permanent and three-dimensional entities , have " structure " and consist of " elements . " The interrelation of " structure " and " elements " is one of mutual determination-dependence . The nature and function of the " elements " is determined by the position which the " elements " occupy in the " structure , " while the " structure " is what it is because of the " elements " which constitute it . That is to say , " structure " and " element " occur only in indissoluble fusion . There exists no " structure " without constituent " elements , " and there exist no " elements " without functional relations of some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nevertheless , has a certain independence of the " elements " ; for , within limits , different " elements " of the same kind may occupy the same position in any given " structure . " But the " elements " are correspondingly independent ; for the same " element " may at different times be included in different " structures . " The " elements " themselves may be " structures " of a " lower " type ; and a given " structure " may , in turn , become an " element " in a " higher " " structure . " Electrons , positrons , and neutrons are thus " elements " in the " structure " atom ; but atoms are " elements " in the " structure " molecule ; molecules are " elements " in the " structure " organic tissue ; and organic tissues are " elements " in the " structure " organism . Some " structures " ? such as houses , bridges , snowflakes , and solid crystals of any kind ? are essentially static ; while others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depend for their very existence upon a development and constant adjustment of their structural " elements . " They are " structures " in process . Obviously , the categories " structure " and " element " possess some of the characteristics which we noted in connection with " form " and " matter " ; yet these two pairs of categories are not identical . The categories " form " and " matter " pertain to the whole of first-person experience and are valid for dream objects and the imaginings of our hallucinations no less than for the experiential complexes which are things in an external world . The categories " structure " and " elements , " however , are valid only for the latter , i.e. , they are valid only for the three-dimensional entities in space ; and they imply a dynamic interdependence of " part " and " whole " which is not present in the interrelation of " form " and " matter . "  | In a sense , of course , " structure " and " element " are but special cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are " form " and " matter " permeated with " harmony " and " incompatibility , " with " inner " and " outer , " and , most important , with " determination " and " dependence . " They are categories of the external world , not simply categories of the contents of first-person experience . One other point must be noted . What I call here " structure " and " element " have often been referred to as " whole " and " part . " I have no objection to this latter terminology so long as the " whole " meant is a " structural whole " and so long as the " parts " are " structural parts " capable of mutual interaction . But when the " whole " is conceived as a mere aggregate and when the " parts " are but unitary and mutually indifferent " additives , " the confusion of " whole " with " structure " and of " part " with " element " is inexcusable . A " whole " may be the sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never a mere sum of its " elements . " The interaction and dynamic interdependence of the " elements " make it something entirely different ? make it a " structure . " PURPOSE AND TELEOLOGY In connection with " inner " and " outer " we pointed out that the most significant meaning of these two ' categories stems from the fact that we experience ourselves in a double role , that , namely , of an " inner " center of " mental events , " and that of a bodied existent in the world of things . The fact of " self-expression " provides , however , a clue to the understanding of other categories as well , and notably to that of the categorical complex " determination-dependence . " David Hume , it will be remembered , repudiated the causal nexus of things because , as he said , " the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences . " However true this Humean statement may be in the realm of things ? and in the empiricist sense it is true ? it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are annoyed or pleased , we are annoyed by something , pleased with something ; and the " something " is usually a specific " something . " That is to say , we experience the " cause " with the " effect . " When I am glad to see you , " I " experience the " gladness " as the direct result of " seeing you " ; i.e. , " I " experience not only " gladness " and " seeing you , " but a relation of " determination-dependence " which connects them . Similarly , if you make a remark which angers me , " I " do not merely experience your " remark " and my " anger " but also the inter-  | connection which makes my anger an " **28;971;TOOLONG . " In the realm of things our knowledge of causal connections may never be completely free from elements of hypothesis ; in some of our psychological reactions , however , the interdependence of " mental events " constitutes the very core of the experiential complex and is known to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at least some of our actions are really " reactions-to-stimuli . " The categorical complex " determination-dependence " is experienced with even greater clarity ( but not necessarily with more certainty ) whenever we try to reach a specific goal or when we employ " means " toward an end . When " I " decide to take a walk , " my " body responds and carries out " my " decision . The movements of my legs are determined by " my " resolve . They continue or stop ( normally ) as " I " determine . This does not mean that " I " am aware of all phases involved in the transition from conscious decision to bodily response ; but it does mean that " I " feel that the motion of my body somehow depends upon " my " decision . In the control which " I " have over my body , " I " experience immediately and directly the " determinationdependence " relation which can not be so directly observed in the realm of things . But this is not all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are carried out either in conformity with , or in opposition to , certain " tendencies " or " inclinations " which " I " have , and they tend to alleviate particular " needs " or to satisfy some " interests " which " I " experience . To " will " something , in other words , is equivalent to " having a purpose , " to " trying to reach a goal " ; and the intention of a goal is immediately given in the characteristic experience of a voluntary act . Intending a goal and achieving it are , however , two entirely different matters . Frequently , the achievement of a goal depends upon the employment of proper " means . " Such means must be selected and , at times , produced before they can be employed . And in this process of selection and production of the " means " to an end we encounter once more the " determination-dependence " relation as an experiential reality ; for if the goal has been agreed upon , we have only a limited choice of means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindrance to unrestricted freedom of action , as a form of " determination-dependence " which we can not escape . We experience it as a compelling necessity ; for our will remains frustrated and impotent as  | long as we fail to employ the means necessary for the realization of its goal . In the strict sense , all purposive action involves a " being aware " of the goal or a " being aware " at least of the general direction in which the goal may be found . Purposive action , in the full sense , is therefore largely restricted to the levels of intelligent behavior . We know it directly and as a fact only in human experience . We may assume that some of the higher animals also are capable of it ; for at times their behavior is strikingly " human . " But no amount of " external " observation of animal behavior can provide the proof which , at the human level , comes from our own experience . However , we must supplement these considerations by an analysis of something more basic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " instincts " and " drives , " to the primary " urges " of hunger , thirst , and sex , as they enter into our own self-experience . In and through these " urges " we experience ourselves as centers of restlessness and " tension , " as " keyed up " for action in certain directions . And these directions imply certain goals . They imply , broadly speaking , the preservation of the individual and the perpetuation of the species . I am not saying , of course , that these goals are consciously present in our " urges , " although they may be ; I am merely indicating them as objectively discernible consequences of our " drives . " The direction toward a goal is there although the goal itself need not be consciously fixed or deliberately agreed upon . Action impelled by our " urges " is not the same as voluntary action . And if the latter is regarded as purposive , the former may be called teleological ; for it is directed toward a goal ; but it is so directed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our part . We can , of course , choose ( within limits ) what we are going to eat or what we are going to drink , and we can ( again within limits ) restrain our sex urge or direct it into channels of our own choosing ; but these matters are irrelevant to the fact that , inherently , every one of our instinctive urges is directed toward a goal and that it is therefore teleological . Moreover , our basic urges find satisfaction through the employment of certain parts of our own body as " means " toward an end . These body-parts bear the imprint of the end to be achieved . The incisors and molars , for example , and their positions in the jaws , the tastebuds of the tongue , the esophagus , the stomach , the whole system of  | glands and internal secretions , of balances and adjustments of the " internal environment " ? all this is intelligible only as means to an end . The teleology of functions is here reflected in the structure in the same way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man-made machines which definitely embody a purpose . At the level of the higher animals we encounter comparable structures and , in all essentials , a corresponding type of behavior . Can we say , therefore , that these animals are centers of " urges " and " drives " such as we experience ourselves to be ? And if we can say this concerning the " higher " animals , can we say it concerning all animals , including the unicellular creatures which multiply by celldivision ? Does our argument from analogy , supplemented as it is by a study of organic structure , still carry conviction ? Can we ascribe to a plant something comparable to the " tensions " which our " urges " produce in us ? We are here on dangerous ground and it is too easy for comfort to fall victims to our own rationalizations . Human experience provides a key to the understanding of nature , to be sure ; for human beings are part of the pattern that is nature . But this does not justify reading human experiences into everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming success of modern science has been achieved largely by going counter to all anthropomorphic tendencies and by eliminating more and more the " human equation " from all fields of study . Whether this tendency of modern science is the final word in the matter or whether it will in the end lead to insurmountable difficulties remains as yet to be seen . In a sense , the remainder of this book is devoted to an attempt at clarification of this point . But our task is arduous and our road long , and many are the opportunities for getting lost in the wilderness of preconception and theoretical bias . Only success or failure in the interpretation of the whole of first-person experience can decide the issue .  | DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WORLD The pattern of the world about us , referred to in the preceding chapter , is as yet undefined in detail and ambiguous in general character . We have , of course , discussed various categories which determine its structure and stratification , but the section on " Purpose and Teleology " has revealed that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole . We only know that whatever knowledge of the external world we possess must have its roots in our own first-person experience and that we can know nothing of that world except through the integration of the elements of order discernible in our experience . But the pattern of that order may be conceived in different ways . The " mystical " pattern of primitive man , for example , is quite different from the " mechanical " pattern of nineteenth-century science , and both differ in fundamental respects from the patterns defined by contemporary science and by Christian theology . From the point of view of critical philosophy , the mystical conception of the world is not just a first step toward our " modern " view , but is ( like scientific cognition , art , and morality ) an independent and in itself complete integration of experience ? an integration , which can not be evaluated properly in terms of extraneous standards of reality but which can be understood , if at all , only in terms of its own inner structure . It presupposes its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , therefore , its own criteria of reality . It is a specific manner of " picturing " the world , of integrating first-person experience ; a unique point of view from which the whole range of experiences is seen and molded into a distinctive pattern of things . The " world " of primitive man is as much a " construction " as is the " world " of the scientist , but not more so . It is the result of an integration of experience and is determined throughout by the specific acts of objectification which transform the contents of firstperson experience into definite objects , and which weave these objects into a pattern of things . The characteristics which distinguish the  | world of primitive man from the world of the modern scientist are direct results of the differences in the integrative processes and stem from differences in the conception of the anticipated pattern . Such differences in interpretation would be impossible if things were " given , " directly and immediately , and were not integrative complexes of first-person experience ; i.e. , if prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content of first-person experience already implied a necessary and inescapable classification of objects . We have seen , however , that things are themselves but objectifications of experiential complexes and that the whole process of objectification enters into their constitution . The existence of space , for example , is as such not " given " with the contents of experience . The three-dimensionality of things , their definite position in three-dimensional space , and their definite distances from other things ? all this is not " given , " immediately and directly , in first-person experience but is a matter of integration and of constructive interpolation , and the whole conception of " physical " space is the product of a constructive imagination . It is a systemic context . And to the extent to which this is true , different contexts may be constructed and different " spaces " and , therefore , different " worlds " may be conceived . The transition from distinct and disparate contents of first-person experience to the pattern of things is possible only because in the flux of our experience certain contents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first elements or fragments of order , and form nuclei around which , in time , we organize the whole of experience . It is important to note , however , that the " given " contents of experience , as soon as they are discerned as distinctive , are seen also in relation to one another and in correlation with the whole of experience ; and they must " prove " themselves in this correlation . Not only do we comprehend them intellectually as constituent elements in a context , but even in their " given " nature they reflect the correlation with other contents of experience . A specific shade of green , for example , will " look different " in different combinations with other colors ; and the Praegnanz ( or lack of it ) of a configuration determines unmistakably the experiential qualities of the elements entering into that configuration . Not one content of experience is ever " given " all by itself and without some relation to other contents . The isolated " datum " does not exist . It is a " boundary  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most primitive pt ceptual contents are inseparable from a selective emphasis of " esse tial " and " non-essential " elements . The possibility of this " selective emphasis " is one of the conditio which enable us to subsume different contents of experience under o concept and to integrate them into a definite and determinate obje The process of integration , therefore , permeates and transmutes t whole of experience , and any difference or shift in the " selecti emphasis " must be reflected in the result of the integration . To what extent the integration of experience as carried out primitive man differs from the integration accomplished by mode science may readily be seen from the respective attitudes towa dreams and hallucinations . It may be discerned also in the demar ( tion or lack of demarcation between the living and the non-livit and in various " practices " which concern the world about us. combat diseases through drugs and vaccines ; primitive man prays his gods and relies upon rites and incantations . We take it for grant that the " laws of nature " govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expression of the wry of supernatural beings , and acts accordingly . The very meaning and function of " concepts " is different from 1 two points of view ; for the " collective representations " of primit : man are not really " concepts , " as we understand that term . They not possess the same purely representative character as do our e ( cepts , and they are not subject to the same rules of logic . Primit man , as a rule , thinks in terms of images , and he does not differenti clearly between the logical content of his images and the hopes a fears which the images call forth in him . No object or thing , therefo is for him what it appears to be to us . The elements of experiet which we regard as important , primitive man may completely c regard ; while he , in his turn , may stress matters which escape attention or which , to us , are unrealities . For him , each particu thing has " affinities " and " powers " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causality is meaningless in world-view . As far as primitive man is concerned , various parts of the hun body ? the heart , the liver , the kidneys , the fat , the marrow , the h ; the blood , and even the excreta ? possess " mystic " powers and ex " magic " influence . The significance of these parts transcends biological functions proper , and their " magic " is more important tl  | is their causal efficacy . Even the things made by man and used by him as tools or weapons possess their " magic " and are useful and potent only because of their special " powers . " The whole social and physical environment is , for primitive man , permeated with mystic " affinities " ; and in harmony with these " affinities " he constructs and integrates his world . Primitive man does not merely associate mystic powers with the various things ; he regards those powers as of the very essence of the things . " Thing " and " powers " still constitute an undifferentiated whole . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its attributes , marks an advanced stage in cultural development and a degree of reflective abstraction not found at the level of " pre-logical " thought . Since primitive man knows no phenomena apart from magic influences , i.e. , since he knows no " natural " phenomena in the sense of modern science , our scientific " explanations " are meaningless to him , and our criteria of objectivity and reality prove nothing as far as he is concerned . He freely " communicates " with " spirits " and " souls " and with " totem animals " ; and the objects of his dreams are as real to him as are the things of the " external " world . Actually , his contact with things is itself a " communication " with intangible and invisible " powers , " with " spirits " and " souls " which , for better or worse , affect the welfare of man and determine his fate . If this mystic conception implies that certain things possess specific " magic " qualities , no amount of " scientific " reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist . The fact that they can not be observed or that they are not effective when put to a test proves nothing ; for these qualities , by their very nature , may be " invisible , " and doubt and skepticism may make them ineffective . Experimental tests , therefore , decide nothing . Primitive man requires no " proof " or " experimental verification . " His belief in the magic property of things is independent of all " demonstrations " and can not be shaken by the lack of " testable evidence . " The world-view of primitive man is , nevertheless , the result of an integration of experience ? just as our world-view is such a result ; but it is the result of an integration which is dominated by what Levy-Bruhl has called " the law of participation , " not by the logical principle of identity or the scientific law of causal relations . This does not mean that primitive man is unaware of the specific shapes or colors of individual things , or that he fails to distinguish one  | thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist for him as bare facts , that they play a part in his personal or tribal life primarily because of the magic powers they possess and because of the penumbra of mystic affinities which surrounds them . Nature , to primitive man , is a realm of invisible and mystic affinities sustained and controlled only by magic powers and by forces subject to magic controls . Sickness and disease are the results of " spells " and " curses " and other mystic influences . Every startling or unusual phenomenon is a " sign " of some impending event ; but as a " sign " it may also be the very cause of the expected event . The rising of the sun and the " growing " of the moon , rain and fair weather , the regularity of the seasons , the productivity of the field , the abundance of the harvest and of animals to hunt ? these and many other " events " must be secured through the magic power of rites and incantations and various sacrifices . And the future can be assured only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and secure the co-operation of " friendly spirits . " The law of mystic " participation " allows no exception . Its efficacy permeates the whole of experience and its synthetic and integrating power determines all . The world-view of primitive man is thus selfsufficient and in itself complete . It is , in principle , as universal in scope and as all-inclusive as is the world-view of science or the world-view of Christian theology ; only it is a world-view of a different type , constructed with a different pattern imposed upon the contents of first-person experience . Which is the true interpretation of that experience ? We point , of course , with pride to the accomplishments of modern science , convinced that there is the truth . But the question can not be answered so easily as that . The philosopher , by the very nature of his task , is compelled to justify his choice and to give reasons for his answer . And are we sure that modern science gives us the whole truth ; that there is no truth outside the sciences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviations from the truth ? After all , what ' is truth ? How do we recognize it ' ? How can we come to know it ? And is it one or many ? The problem is not as simple as it appears to be at first glance . AMBIGUITY OF THE CONCEPT TRUTH ' The word true ' ( truth ' ) is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word " treowe , " meaning faithful or trusty . One may therefore speak of a  | true friend , meaning a faithful or loyal friend ; or one may designate , in general , anything as true if it can be relied upon . But the word true ' may also mean genuine , as in the statement , " This crystallized carbon is a true diamond " ; or it may mean conformable to a standard , as in the assertion , " This picture is a true likeness of the deceased " ; or it may designate conformity to type , as in the statement , " Mutants breed true . " All of these meanings ? and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , " but they are not what the word true ' connotes in epistemology . According to the dictionary , true ' means also conformable to fact , correct , not erroneous ; and it is this sense of the word , and this sense alone , which concerns us here . It is obvious from the epistemological meaning of truth , ' as given in the dictionary , that this word is an adjectival noun ; that it designates a quality ? conformable to fact , not erroneous ? rather than a thing . Moreover , the quality designated by the word can be attributed only to propositions . If this is not itself obvious , it is at least tradition in philosophical discourse . There exists no entity " truth , " and certainly not an entity TRUTH ( with capital letters ) . Only propositions are true . And to assert that a , given proposition is true is to assert that it conforms to fact or that it is not erroneous . So far , of course , we have only introduced synonyms of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have selected one of these meanings as alone relevant to the problems of epistemology . We must now probe deeper into the meaning of truth ' by asking what is meant by conformable to fact ' and by not erroneous , ' and how we can know whether or not a given proposition is " conformable to fact " and is " not erroneous . " REPUDIATION OF SKEPTICISM Before an adequate answer to these questions has been given , the skeptic may deny the significance of our problem and may assert that there is no truth ; that the search after truth is meaningless as well as futile . The answer to the skeptic is quite obvious ; for his denial of all truth involves him in an inescapable contradiction . Whosoever maintains that there is no truth either says nothing or he asserts a proposition which he himself must regard as true . And once it is admitted that at least one proposition is true , there is no a priori reason why  | others might not also be true . The attainment of truth is then no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless . There is no escape from this conclusion even if the skeptic were now to assert that there is only one true proposition , the proposition , namely , that there is no truth . Such an assertion , after all , presupposes that we know something concerning the nature of propositions ; that we know , for instance , how one proposition differs from all others . And it presupposes also that this knowledge is true . Actually , the assertion that only the proposition denying all truth is true assumes true knowledge of such scope and detail that it transcends by far anything we can legitimately claim to know ; for it presupposes that we know not only all possible propositions ( past , present , and future ) , but also that all but one of these propositions are false ? a presupposition which is impossible of demonstration ( cf. Blanshard ) . The denial of the truth of all but one proposition presupposes , furthermore , that we are in possession of a criterion of truth and falsity , and that this criterion is unfailing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In brief , the skeptic 's denial of truth presupposes a knowledge of reality which far exceeds anything we have actually achieved in science or in philosophy ; and it implies that this all-inclusive knowledge is true . We shall therefore leave the skeptic to his own designs and his own contradictions and shall turn to a constructive interpretation of the meaning and nature of truth . " SELF-EVIDENT " TRUTHS Some propositions are said to be self-evident and therefore true beyond the shadow of a doubt ( cf. Ducasse ) . The following statements are typical examples of the types of propositions included in this class : A is not non-A . Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other . Two straight lines can not enclose a space . If A precedes B , then A precedes everything which is contemporaneous with B. The red I see here differs in quality from the green I see there . I exist . It is my duty to produce the greater good rather than the less .  | The great variety of propositions thus regarded as self-evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only principles of logic and mathematics , but propositions concerning experiential qualities and moral laws as well.1 However , many propositions formerly accepted as self-evident have been shown by philosophers and scientists to be false . The Aristotelian " law " of falling bodies and the contentions that the earth is at the center of the universe , that it is stationary , and that it is not round , are such disproved " self-evident " " truths . " If the criterion of self-evidence can not be depended upon in all cases , what assurance do we have that it is trustworthy in some ? And what , exactly , is the criterion of " self-evidence " ? Difficulties arise as soon as we ask what , precisely , distinguishes a " self-evident " proposition from other propositions ; for we discover that there is no clean-cut line of demarcation . The difference is at best one of degree only . The whole history of the discovery of " selfevident " truths bears this out . Practically all of the so-called " selfevident " truths were discovered in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once into prominence as something strikingly unique and inescapable . Often it was necessary to prove in a roundabout way the presumed " self-evidence " of a proposition . This is true , for example , in the case of the basic laws of logic . The proof depends here on showing that the laws in question can not be consistently denied so long as we accept as valid any logical implications of this denial . If we deny , for instance , the validity of the law of contradiction , we must assert that the law itself is false rather than true . But if we do this , we actually assume the very validity which we intend to deny ; for we assume that if the law is false it can not also be true ; we assume , in other words , that A is not non-A . The attempted denial of the law of contradiction thus entails an inescapable contradiction ( cf. Blanshard ) . But is this contradiction which is implicit in its denial proof of the " self-evidence " of the law as such ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that " self-evidence " is one thing , and that the acceptance of a proposition as true because of what its denial entails is quite another . I would contend , in other words , that the fundamen-Footnote  | tal laws of thought must be accepted as true not because they are in themselves self-evident , but because without them no inference is possible and all thinking must come to a stop . This applies to the law of excluded middle no less than to the laws of contradiction and identity ; for if we deny the law of excluded middle ? the law , namely , that X is either A or non-A ? our thought is confronted with " objects " which are neither A nor non-A , or which are both A and non-A ; and in either case intelligible thought is impossible ? as may be discovered by actual trial . ' Turning to the field of mathematics , we discover that the " axioms " which provide the broad foundations of mathematical systems , are no longer regarded as self-evident truths . The development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mathematicians now speak of " postulates " and " primitive propositions " where their predecessors accepted " self-evident truths . " Even so simple a statement as that " a straight line is the shortest distance between two points , " is no longer regarded as self-evident ; for its truth depends on the geometrical system within which straight line , ' point , " shortest distance , ' and between ' are defined . But what about propositions which refer to qualitative complexes in first-person experience ? That is to say , what about propositions such as these : " The direction taken by the following two lines , is exactly the same " ; " The experienced quale of the red ' here differs from the experienced quale of the green ' there " ; " I have a headache . " ? Consider the proposition concerning the two straight lines first . If it is taken to be a statement concerning two physically real " lines , " i.e. , if it is a statement concerning the ink marks on the paper , then this proposition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false . Two lines which appear to have the same direction may actually differ in direction ? the difference being so small that it escapes casual observation . If perceptual impressions could always be relied upon to disclose the actual state of affairs , i.e. , if judgments of perception were self-evident truths , much of the painstaking work now devoted to the devising and development of methods of measuring and checking perceptual impressions would be superfluous . But scientists do not find it so ( cf. Blanshard ) . Footnote  | Let us suppose now that the proposition under consideration refers only to the experiential quale of the visual impressions . It is then of the same type as is the proposition concerning the difference in the experienced qualia of " red " and " green . " Does this restriction to the realm of sense-data entail the self-evident truth of our propositions ? On the face of it it seems obvious that , since " red " and " green " look different to me , the proposition asserting this difference is true , because to me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition , the proposition is self-evident . But is this really all there is to it ? If it is , then what does self-evident ' mean in this connection ? If it means anything at all , then , it seems to me , it must mean that somehow the sense-data themselves , as " given " or " brute " facts of experience , indubitably verify the propositions pertaining to them . And if this is what is meant by self-evident , ' then numerous problems remain unsolved . What , for instance , are the " given " or " brute " facts of sense-experience ? In order to simplify matters , let us consider only those experiential situations in which error seems impossible . Propositions such as " I now see a red , " " I now taste a bitter , " " I now hear C# , " indicate what is meant ; and so do propositions such as " I have a headache , " " I am afraid , " " I feel nauseated . " Does not the fact that I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verify , immediately and directly , the proposition asserting this fact ? And is not the proposition true because it is self-evident ? Is it not true simply because its very meaning is the fact as experienced ? On the face of it we seem to have found here an indubitable certainty of elementary propositions which might well be called " self evidence " ; but only on the face of it . When I assert that " I see a red " or that " I have a headache " ? no matter how simple my proposition may seem ? it yet refers to something which goes beyond a mere datum , beyond a " given " or " brute " fact . Who is the " I " who sees red or who has a headache ? Do not the words see ' and have ' designate relations which are not simply part of the qualia of " red " or a " headache " ? Does not the indefinite article in the proposition indicate class-membership ? Is not " red " a specific kind of color quale specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sound " and " taste " ? Is not a " headache " a special kind of pain felt in a special part of my body ? Are all of these relations " given " in the sense-datum itself ? If not , then what actually is the " brute fact " which directly verifies the propositions in question ?  | Is it at all possible to pick out one item from the list and to say that this is it , or this ? Are not rather all of the items mentioned necessary for the verification of my propositions ? And are they not necessary in integrated unity ? But let us simplify the situation still further by excluding from it everything but the " red " or the " ache " or whatever specific " quale " we want to consider . Our proposition describing this remainder may then be stated in some such form as " This is red " ( " There is an ache " ) or " Here now red " ( " Here now aching " ) ( cf. Blanshard ) . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " brute fact " which directly verifies our proposition and makes it self-evident ? I doubt it . That the simplicity of such particular experiences as " here-now-red " is apparent rather than real may be gathered from the fact that a complicated scientific theory of space-time is involved in any fully warranted assertion about the experience . Nor is this all . All propositions dealing with sense-data are fundamentally synthetic . In and through them a particular " something , " referred to as " this " or identified by " here now , " is subsumed under a universal , be it " red " or " ache " or anything else . The very act of identifying a datum as " this " enmeshes it in the context of meaning and thought ; and it is this context , and this context alone , which gives significance to the proposition in question . In order to know that " this " is red or that " this " is a headache , I must already know the meaning of red ' and of headache ' ; i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this " to a whole class of similar experiences , and must contrast it with others . And in this process I may go astray . Where , for example , does " red " end and " orange " begin ? Where is the line of demarcation between an " ache " and no ache at all ? And is it not possible that I mistake for a " toothache " the pain which results from an infected sinus ? It is , of course , true that , as a rule , I go astray in my judgments concerning sense-data only at certain critical points . Is a given color " green " or is it " blue " ? Ordinarily I may have no difficulty classifying it properly . But if the color in question is a " blue-green , " or if light conditions obscure the hues , does not my judgment falter ? Where is the self-evidence of the proposition upon which my decision can rest unfailingly ? Or , to use another example , is the sound I now hear really C# ? That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute " sense of pitch ? To raise such a question is to answer it in  | the negative ; for the truth of the proposition " I now hear C# " is never self-evident . It is established only through the inspection of " confirmatory " evidence ( cf. Blanshard ; Ewing ) . Now , if some propositions pertaining to sense-data are demonstrably not self-evident , is there any reason to believe that some of them are ? Is there , in other words , a demonstrable difference between the two types ? a difference which is more than a matter of degrees ? To this question , I believe , the answer must also be negative ; for no such difference is directly apparent in first-person experience and none has ever been established through irrefutable argument . At most it may be said that we accept certain propositions pertaining to sense-data as true because , to us , they identify or describe a state or condition which we actually experience at the time ; because , in our first-person experience , they correspond to the facts . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " correspondence theory " of truth . THE CORRESPONDENCE THEORY In its broad and elementary form , the " correspondence theory " of truth asserts that " a proposition is true if , and only if , it corresponds with reality . " However , in this form the theory is untenable , for its defects are numerous and decisive . To begin with , it is not at all clear what is meant by " correspondence with reality . " If the phrase means a correspondence between the meaning of a proposition and the referent intended , then the issue involved is not one of truth or falsity , but concerns the correct or incorrect use of words . It is a problem in semantics , not one in epistemology ; and as such it does not concern us here ( cf. Blanshard ) . If the phrase in question means that my belief in , or acceptance of , a proposition is in harmony with the actual truth-value of the proposition ; that is to say , if it means that I accept or believe a proposition when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is false , the issue is again not one of truth or falsity but pertains to the soundness or reliability of my judgment . It is of psychological rather than epistemological import . Finally , if the phrase " correspondence with reality " means that my " ideas , " as mental events , correspond to " things , " as non-mental entities , in a way similar to that in which a portrait of a person " corresponds " to that person , or in which a map " corresponds " to , the geographical features of the region it represents , then it can be  | shown that while the phrase does indeed define a criterion of truth , the criterion thus defined is impossible of application unless it is radically restricted in scope . In order to ascertain whether or not a portrait " corresponds " with the person it portrays , i.e. , in order to ascertain whether or not the " picture " is a true likeness of the " original , " I must compare the two . Reasoning from facile but false analogy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar manner , I can ascertain whether or not my ideas " correspond " with reality by comparing them with the actual things . If they are " true likenesses " of the things , my ideas are true ; and if they are not such " likenesses , " they are false . This argument from analogy is fallacious because there is no way in which I can compare the things , as non-mental entities and as they are apart from my ideas , with my ideas about them . Things , as they are in themselves , are not accessible to me in the same way in which ideas are ; and if they were , I should know them as directly and immediately as I know my ideas and should therefore no longer depend for true knowledge about them upon a comparison of my " ideas " with the " things . " The correspondence theory , in its broad and ' unrestricted sense , breaks down simply because it demands that I compare something given in my experience ( the idea ) with something which is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and such comparison is impossible . All " comparing " takes place only within firstperson experience and , as a consequence , only " ideas " can be compared with one another . I can not compare my idea of the Grand Teton , for example , with the mountain itself as it exists outside my experience ; I can compare it at best only with the perceptual experiences which I have when I believe that I see the mountain . As applied to propositions dealing with things of the external world the correspondence criterion fails , furthermore , because it presupposes that we have knowledge of the things which is independent of the integrative interpolation of first-person experience , when , as a matter of fact , no such knowledge is available . In other words , the criterion fails because it implies that we adapt our ideas to " things as they are " when actually our knowledge about things ? the very idea even that there are physical entities which transcend my first-person experience and yours ? rests upon and presupposes  | the validity of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-person experience . But what about the modified or restricted " correspondence theory " according to which propositions pertaining to sense-data are true if what they assert " corresponds " with the facts of sense-data as experienced ? What about the contention , in other words , that the simple ostensive propositions ? such as " This is red , " " This is bitter , " " This is C# " ? may be verified by their " correspondence " with our actual experience of the respective sense-data ? This restricted " correspondence theory " avoids at least the most crucial mistake of the broader view . The reference to a reality which remains outside all possible experience has been eliminated and all of the elements which are to be " compared " with one another are assumed to be immanent in first-person experience ; we can be aware of them at the same time and in the same sense ( cf. Sellars ) . The advantage thus gained for the " correspondence theory " is , however , more apparent than real ; for the theory , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those propositions which do not ostensively deal with sense-data . It is insufficient , in other words , for our largest and most important body of knowledge . Scientific knowledge in particular pertains neither directly nor even primarily to immediately experienced sense-data . The verification of the propositions or laws of the sciences is achieved , not so much through a " comparison " with sense-data , but rather through propositions and chains of propositions which only at some ultimate ' point may pertain to sense-data . In modern physics , for example , verification consists essentially in disclosing the inner consistency of a formal system of laws , and in making evident the general agreement of this system with an integrative interpolation of certain data ( and not only sense-data ) of first-person experience . What is true in physics is true in the other empirical sciences as well . The criterion resorted to is " coherence of ideas " rather than " correspondence " betweenideasand some " given " sense-data . However , we shall not press this point at the present ; it suffices for our purposes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " correspondence . " We ask next , Is it a fact that all simple ostensive propositions are true because they " correspond " directly with the data of immediate sense experience ; and is it a fact that at the level of sense experience " correspondence " is the sole and sufficient criterion of truth ?  | In Chapter III enough evidence has been produced , I believe , to show that the " simple and isolated sense-datum " is never " given " in experience ; that , on the contrary , this " datum " is obtained only through a process of abstraction which isolates it from the context of first-person experience as a whole . This fact obviously leads to some doubts concerning the significance or reliability of the " correspondence " criterion ; for if that criterion implies that our simple ostensive propositions are true only because they " correspond " with some " data " which we ourselves have delimited through a process of abstraction , then the " standard of comparison , " so essential to the correspondence theory , is by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dependent upon , the very same processes of thought for which it is to be the standard . The argument , if pressed , turns into a vicious circle . Actually , of course , the presence of sensory elements in our firstperson experience can not be denied . The terms red , ' bitter , ' hot , ' C# , ' pain ' designate experiential qualia which can not be reduced further and which can not be derived from other factors in experience . But the moment we identify a certain quale as " red " or as " pain " ? and only when it has been so identified can it serve as a " standard of comparison " ? we view it in relation to other qualia of " its kind " and in contrast to qualia not of " its kind " ; that is to say , the moment we identify it , we no longer deal with it as a mere sense-datum . The concept employed in its delimitation identifies it as a member of a class . Now , to identify a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in principle , two things . It involves , in the first place , a reference to the experiences of the past which provide the basis for my understanding of the term employed . In this sense , my assertion , " This is red , " means , " This is like such and such other experiences which I have had . " Whatever " comparing " is involved in this recognition pertains , in the last analysis , to a " present datum " and my memory of " similar data previously experienced . " If in the past I have called such and such qualia " red , " then I must call the present quale by the same name . It is the context with those other experiences which determines whether or not my present assertion is true . And this , it seems , is a matter quite different from what the correspondence theory implies . In the second place , my identification of a specific quale as a member of a certain class pertains also to the future . That is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " This is red , " I expect that whenever I actually do experience the intended quale it will be such as I have identified as " red " in the past . The meaning of concepts thus transforms my memory of previous experiences into an anticipation of the future ; and the proposition expressing this anticipation is true if , and only if , the future experience actually is of the kind I expect ; i.e. , if it is similar to the experiences of the past which have given meaning to my concept . Again , it will be noted , the criterion of truth is context with other experiences rather than a " correspondence " between my proposition and a " given " datum . It may be argued , however , that the kinds of propositions so far considered are not the most elementary available and that only the latter imply the " correspondence " required as a criterion of truth . We presumably encounter these " elementary " propositions when we identify some experiential quale not previously observed as a specific " this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by anyone , or a sound previously unheard , or a sensory quality sui generis which is neither color nor sound nor taste nor smell nor anything else so far known to man ; but if we say of it , " This is andimo " ? using a new name to identify the new quale ? are we not then employing a proposition which is true only because it " corresponds " with the quale itself ? The answer , of course , is that in this case we employ no proposition at all ; for either the statement , " This is andimo , " is meaningless because it involves an undefined term , or it is equivalent to the statement , " I shall henceforth identify this new quale by calling it andimo , " and it is then a resolution to use a certain word in a certain way ; i.e. , it is a definition rather than a proposition . As definition , it is neither true nor false but indifferent to all truth-values . There are , thus , no propositions of a type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the truth of those propositions depends on the context of experience rather than upon any " correspondence " between an individual proposition and an isolated sense-datum . As a consequence of this dependence upon context , the propositions in question are not infallibly true ; for I may be mistaken in relating a specific quale to a class A rather than to a class B. I may , for example , identify it as " red " when I should have identified it as " orange . " The error is not just a " breach of custom " in the use of words ; it is a mistake pertaining to fact and is therefore one rendering false the proposition , " This is red . " But the " fact " it refers to is not an isolatf ' . sense-datum . It is , rather , the  | context of experience in which sense-data occur as differentiable classes of qualia . One last point may be noted . In the actual process of scientific inquiry , propositions pertaining to " facts " are important only because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the " facts " support the hypothesis , they are accepted as " confirming the theory " ; but if they conflict with it , they do not always lead to the rejection of the hypothesis . On the contrary , the facts themselves may be " broken down " in the light of the hypothesis and may be " re-interpreted " until agreement with accepted theory has been reached . That is to say , observation and experience are never taken as providing irrefutable proof of the truth or falsity of propositions ? as they ought to be , if " correspondence " with perceived facts were the test of truth . What actually happens is that we accept the evidence of " facts " only if the consequence of rejecting the propositions which they support is more disastrous to our body of knowledge than is the consequence of accepting them . Context and coherence , in other words , is the last court of appeals even here ( cf. Waters ) . THE PRAGMATIC THEORY In at least one of its forms the " correspondence theory " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that " truth " is 0 the correspondence of these images with the things of which they are the images ( " copy theory " of truth ) . But , as Spencer and Peirce have noted before , many of the ideas presented in our propositions have no " pictorial " meaning . We have , for example , no " images " of mass , gravitation , electricity , and magnetism ; of free will , justice , social order , or of God ; nor can we conceive genuine " pictorial images " of such matters . Our analysis of concepts has shown , furthermore , that no universals can ever be " pictured " as universals . Wherever images are associated with our concepts , they are unessential , if not irrelevant , to the meanings intended ? unless , of course , the images themselves are the referents under consideration . The whole idea of " pictured " meanings is inadequate , if not misleading , and ought to be discarded . But what is to be put in its place ? Herbert Spencer maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leads to verifiable predictions . In extension of this principle , Charles S. Peirce asserted that the meaning of every idea may be found in the difference it makes in our experience or in the sense-effects to which it leads . If ideas make no difference in experience , i.e. , if they have no discernible effects , they are meaningless ;  | and if they have identical effects , then they are the same ideas ? regardless of what words may be employed in speaking about them . Now , in so far as ideas make a discernible difference in my experience , Peirce argues , they also induce me to make specific adjustments . I act in response to them , and I conform in whatever I do to their implied suggestions . Ideas , in other words , are " plans of action . " They have meaning only as " plans of action " ; and belief in them " establishes in our nature a rule of action or . . . a habit . " If , for the sake of argument , we accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are led , more or less logically , to William James 's contention that a belief is true only if it guides us to success or if it establishes valuable habits , and that it is false if it leads us astray or develops destructive habits . We are led to the conclusion , in other words , that " a belief is true if it works " ( cf. Blanshard ) . This " pragmatic theory " of truth suffers , however , from an initial ambiguity ; for it is by no means clear what is meant by " it works . " For instance , " it works " may mean simply that the belief in question leads to the perceptual experiences or to the pain or pleasure anticipated or predicted in the belief . In this sense , the verifiability of a scientific hypothesis may be said to be its truth . But , " it works " may also mean " it is in harmony with other propositions . " No belief can be taken entirely by itself . Isolated propositions do not constitute a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent beliefs constitute such a body . Hence , if a new belief is out of harmony with beliefs already accepted , either the new belief must be discarded or the old ones must be overhauled . Whichever alternative we choose , only that belief can be regarded as " true " which " works " in the sense that it establishes complete ( or , at least , an increased ) harmony of all accepted beliefs ? including the beliefs of other people . Finally , " it works " may mean that the belief gives desirable direction to our feelings and emotions . In this sense , other things being equal , a belief which gives comfort and stability and moral strength , a belief , in other words , which " enhances life " and , in general , makes for optimism , is to be preferred to one which tends in the opposite direction . It is in this sense that religious , moral , and metaphysical beliefs may be regarded as " true " ? especially if experience shows that in the long run these beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of these interpretations of the phrase , " it works , " the first two are clearly the most important . The third is of no cognitive significance whatsoever ; for it ultimately implies the destruction of all objective standards and the enthronement of a thoroughgoing relativism of subjective beliefs . Whatever contributes to the " abundance of my living , " i.e. , whatever " works " for me , is " true " ! It is obvious that knowledge , as we understand it and as it permeates the whole of modern civilization , finds no support in such a criterion , and that the edifice of the sciences can not be based upon the quicksands of such a doctrine . The pragmatists themselves have resorted to this third interpretation of their criterion only when a given issue could not be decided on other grounds . The first two interpretations of the phrase , " it works , " deserve careful analysis . If they are combined so as to supplement each other , they are especially significant . For the present , however , the first of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of primary interest ; for the second , the criterion of " harmony with other propositions , " is essentially an appeal to context and will therefore be discussed when we deal with the " coherence theory " of truth . The pragmatist 's appeal to " verification " is inseparably bound up with his thesis that " ideas are plans of action " ; for , according to pragmatic doctrine , a proposition is " true " when our action , carried out in conformity with the idea or " plan " embodied in the proposition , actually leads to the result anticipated by the idea . It follows that the criterion of " verification " will be impaired if it can be shown that the meaning of an idea is not in itself a " plan of action " ( cf. Hinshaw ) . What , precisely , is a " plan of action " ? What does the idea of such a " plan " involve ? Let us examine a specific case . Suppose that it is my " plan " to buy a new suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a certain state of affairs not now existent ( my ownership of a new suit ) and I believe that through a certain action on my part ( purchase ) I can realize my goal . However , neither my desire nor my belief nor the combination of the two is in itself a " plan of action . " Something else must come into the picture . I must resolve to act in the manner which I believe will lead to the desired result ; i.e. , I must resolve to purchase the suit . Without this resolve I have no " plan of action " ; I have at best only a basis for such a plan ( cf. Blanshard ) . If this distinction between " basis for a plan " and " plan of action "  | reflects ? as I believe that it does ? a legitimate differentiation in firstperson experience , then it follows that the thesis which identifies the " meaning " of an idea with a " plan of action " is at least misleading . If I know , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I know what properties a " typewriter " has , and if I also desire a certain end ( such as writing a letter ) , then my knowledge of the properties of a typewriter is a basis for a plan of action ( although it is not the sole factor to be considered ) , but my " plan of action " itself is the resolution to use the typewriter ( rather than a pen ) for the purpose of writing the letter . Stated in general , our knowledge concerning the " nature of things , " i.e. , any proposition or " idea " which designates a set of properties or which defines a " thing , " is a potential basis for a plan of action but is not that plan itself . To take it as such a plan is to take it for something which it can never be ; for a proposition is not in itself a resolution ; it is not a decision to act in a certain manner . As basis for a plan of action an idea is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The plan is what it is , at least in part , because of the " idea " which serves as its cognitive basis . Hence , if our " idea " is true , the plan based upon it should have a good chance of succeeding . That its success is not fully assured is due to the fact that in this world of causal determinations and conflicting interests the execution of any plan depends upon other factors besides the cognitive basis . If the " idea " is false , the plan based upon it may yet succeed because of a chance constellation of causal factors which has little or nothing to do with the " plan " as such . The success or failure of a " plan , " therefore , is no guarantee of the truth or falsity of the " ideas " which provide its cognitive basis . " Success " is not identical with " truth , " nor is " failure " the same as " falsity . " And yet , if we wish to ascertain whether or not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , do something or perform some " operation " ; i.e. , we must manipulate other propositions ( inference ) or we must observe and handle things ( experimentation ) . If the " operation " leads to the anticipated result , we regard the proposition in question as true ; if it leads to results which are incompatible with what was anticipated or " predicted , " the proposition is false . Scientific verification is always of this " operational " type . Even so , however , the " pragmatic theory " of truth is hardly adequate ; for it leaves unanswered one crucial question . If we can discover the truth or falsity of a given proposition only by acting upon  | it or by performing some " operation , " then how do we know whether or not the actual result of the " operation " is identical with the predicted result ? To put it otherwise , How do we know that the proposition , " This actual result is identical with this predicted result , " is true ? Do we know this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , then the same question returns with respect to the result of this new " operation " ? and with respect to the result of every additional " operation " which we may perform . In other words , if the truth of a proposition can be ascertained only by performing some " operation , " then an infinite series of " operations " must be performed before a single truth is established ; and this is manifestly impossible . Exclusive reliance upon " operation , " therefore , results in no truth at all . If , on the other hand , this regress ad infinitum is to be avoided , we must accept a criterion of truth which , at cardinal points in our search after knowledge , makes further recourse to " operations " unnecessary . The " pragmatic theory " does not provide this additional criterion ( cf. Blanshard ) . THE VERIFIABILITY THEORY Logical positivists and empiricists have developed a theory which makes " verifiability " the criterion of truth . In its early ( and crude ) formulation this criterion was identified with actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it had been verified , i.e. , when an " operation " had been performed " demonstrating " its truth . If for theoretical or practical reasons actual demonstration was impossible , the proposition was regarded as " unverifiable " and was said to be neither true nor false. / This theory , strictly speaking , identifies " truth of " with " having demonstrated the truth of " ? an identification which , if clearly understood , is completely arbitrary and is not justified by general usage of the terms ; or which , if not clearly understood , is an intolerable equivocation and a source of error and confusion . Logical positivists , therefore , soon modified their theory . Instead of using " actual verification " as the criterion of truth , they now speak of " verifiability " and , more precisely , of " verifiability in principle . " A proposition is said to be " true " when it is " verifiable in principle " ; i.e. , when we know the conditions which , when realized , will make " verification " possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to impose at once certain restrictions upon this general statement ; for the " conditions " which we regard in  | any given case as making " verification " possible must contradict neither the laws of logic nor any known law of nature . They must , in principle , be realizable in the world as we know it . The proposition , " There are mountains on the other side of the moon , " is " verifiable " in this sense ; for we know exactly what would be necessary to verify it , and these known conditions are , in principle , not unrealizable in the world in which earth and moon exist ; i.e. , they do not contradict the known laws of that world . On the other hand , the proposition , " I remember best the things which happened the week after next , " is ? unverifiable ? ; for , given the conventional meaning of its terms , the proposition asserts a logical impossibility , and the condition of " living backwards " which it assumes is irreconcilable with the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " **31;1001;TOOLONG " can have no bearing upon the truth or falsity of a proposition . If they had , the criterion of " verifiability " would lose all significance , for it would then entail the question-begging assertion that we should be able to verify any given proposition if we were in a position enabling us to verify it . No limits would be imposed upon our imagination or upon our ability to invent " conditions , " and no proposition whatever would remain " unverifiable " ( cf. Ducasse , 1941 ) . But if the criterion of " verifiability " is restricted as indicated , it is still far from being adequate or sufficient ; and this for two reasons . ( 1 ) It presupposes a body of established laws and of " true " knowledge about the world which , in turn , must find justification in some form of " verifiability . " And if the same restrictions are again imposed ( as they must be ) , then there must exist a still different body of knowledge established by some still more antecedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . It is difficult to see how under conditions involving such a regress there could ever arise a body of " true " knowledge . ( 2 ) The criterion of " verifiability " leads to an infinite regress also in a different way ? and in a way which is strikingly similar to that involved in the " pragmatic " theory of truth . If a proposition , P , may be regarded as true only when we know the conditions under which it can be verified , does it not follow that any proposition P ' which asserts the truth of P , i.e. , any proposition of the form , " P fulfills all conditions of verifiability , " can be regarded as true only if the conditions of its verification are also known , and so on ad infinitum ? If either regress into infinity is to be avoided , at least some of our  | propositions must be of a type such that their truth no longer depends upon " verifiability " or " conditions of verifiability " but becomes evident in some other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be supplemented by considerations of a different kind ( cf. Blanshard ) . Logical positivists and empiricists may be willing to admit ( 1 ) that our criticism is relevant as far as propositions of an essentially hypothetical nature are concerned , and ( 2 ) that the criticisms so far developed would be decisive if all propositions were of this type . They will maintain , however , that some propositions are not hypothetical and that " verifiability " of these propositions means something quite different from what we have discussed up to now . Let me try to make this point clear . It must be noted that some propositions can be " verified " only in an indirect way ; for their complex terms designate nothing that is " given , " directly and immediately , in first-person experience . Propositions of this type entail , however , more elementary propositions ; i.e. , they entail propositions which are " irreducible " or " basic , " and which can be " verified " by immediate experience ( cf. Neurath ) . For instance , the proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements concerning sense-data : " If this is a tree , then I shall see certain colors and shapes and , upon touching it , I shall have specific tactual experiences . " The sense-data thus referred to are objects of immediate experience . If I encounter them in my own experience they " verify " for me , or confirm , the original proposition . But the whole process indicates that the proposition , " This is a tree , " is essentially a hypothesis . It can be accepted as true only if we know the conditions under which we can actually experience the sense-data referred to in the " basic " statements which it entails . If all propositions were of this type , the criticisms so far advanced against the " verifiability " theory of truth would be final and unanswerable . The " basic " statements , however , are intended to be of a different type . Their " verification " is assumed to be direct and not mediated by other propositions . Some philosophers , in order to eliminate all possible doubt as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " disconfirmation " ) when the propositions under consideration are essentially hypothetical , and of " verification " ( and " falsification " ) when the propositions in question are " basic " statements . A proposition is said to be " confirmed " when the basic statements which it entails have been " verified " ; it is " disconfirmed " when the same basic  | statements have been " falsified . " And , correspondingly , a proposition is said to be " confirmable " if we know ( 1 ) the basic statements which it entails and ( 2 ) the conditions under which these basic statements may be " verified . " It is " disconfirmable " if we know ( 1 ) the basic statements which it entails and ( 2 ) the conditions under which these basic statements may be " falsified . " If this is at all an adequate statement of the meaning of " confirmation " ( " disconfirmation " ) or of " confirmability " ( " disconfirmability " ) , then it is evident , I believe , that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of context with other propositions ? of context , namely , with " basic " statements . And to the extent to which this is so , context or " coherence " becomes the criterion of truth . " Verifiability " is only an adjunct to the contextual pattern . The matter seems to be quite different in the case of all " basic " statements . Propositions of the type , " This is green , " " This is sour , " " This is C# , " seem to be " verifiable , " directly and immediately , through our experiencing , here and now , the specific qualia referred to . But if this is what is meant by " verifiability " ? the possibility of noting in our first-person experience the actual presence of the intended quale ? then the criterion of " verifiability " is essentially identical with the ultimate criterion of " correspondence " ; and the arguments advanced against the latter hold good also against the former . There is no escape from context or " coherence . " The isolated " basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated sense-datum or the isolated " thing . " THE COHERENCE THEORY If all our analyses of truth lead to context or " coherence , " and if there is no escape from " coherence , " does this perchance mean that " coherence " itself is the criterion of truth ? To this question the " coherence " theory gives an unqualifiedly affirmative answer ; and its advocates advance negative as well as positive arguments to support their contention ( cf. Blanshard ) . The negative arguments rest upon the generally admitted fact that inconsistencies within and among propositions are indicative of error or non-truth . If it be asserted , for example , that the earth is round , and also that it is flat , then this contradiction or " incoherence " indicates that there is error or non-truth somewhere . Of two contradictory or inconsistent propositions at least one must be false ; or , what amounts to the same thing ,  | true propositions must be consistent with one another . This means that they must " cohere . " On the positive side it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideal of an integrated " coherent " body of laws and principles , is the ultimate goal toward which we are striving in cognition , and that philosophers and scientists alike , working on the elimination of inconsistencies , try to achieve a systemic " coherence " of all knowledge . These arguments , admittedly , do not tell the whole story . Nor do - they indicate specifically what " coherence " means . It may be granted that inconsistency means error or non-truth ; but we can not infer from this that consistency means truth . The " coherence " criterion , therefore , must mean something which includes consistency but which also goes beyond it . I take it to be a type of interrelatedness of propositions which can best be described as systemic entailment . In its rigid form this interrelatedness would be comparable to the interdependent system of theorems which constitutes Euclidean geometry . In its scope , however , it would encompass all possible " true " propositions and would leave no aspect of experience unintegrated . No " true " proposition would remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherence " is taken in this comprehensive sense of " systemic entailment , " then certain difficulties are at once apparent . The relation of " entailment , " for example , is not in itself a guarantee of truth ; for if the truth of a given proposition , p , entails the truth of some other proposition , q , then it is also a fact that the falsity of q entails the falsity of p . " Entailment , " in other words , is reconcilable with falsity as well as with truth ( cf. Ducasse , 1944 ) . Furthermore , if a " system " of propositions , A , is so constructed that p entails q , q entails r , r entails s , and s entails t , then , because of the very nature of the entailment relation , there exists also a " system , " B , within which non-t entails non-s , non-s entails non-r , non-r entails non-q , and non-q entails non-p . If A is a " coherent " system , then B also is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositions included in B are the contradictories of their respective counterparts in A. Since of two contradictory propositions at least one must be false , it follows that at least one of the two systems must contain false propositions . If this is so , and if both systems are equally " coherent , " then " coherence " taken by itself is inadequate as a general criterion of truth . In their endeavor to escape this criticism , the advocates of the  | " coherence " theory of truth may now maintain that the preceding argument rests upon the fictitious assumption that both systems , A and B , are of equal experiential significance . They may maintain , in other words , that if system A actually integrates our first-person experience ? either the whole or a part of it ? then system B will fail to do so ; and that this fact is decisive . The real issue , then , is not the mere formal equality of contradictory systems , but their effectiveness in the integration of experience . " Coherence , " in this sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or falsity ) of a proposition is determined by the extent to which it contributes to a " coherent " view of experience , or , in the negative sense , by the extent to which its denial would disrupt such a view . An obvious answer to this new argument is the contention that unless the truth-value of some propositions is known without recourse to " coherence " we have no assurance that any particular " system " of propositions actually integrates experience . In other words , we encounter once more the need for " basic " statements which link " systems " of propositions with the " facts " of experience , and which thus warrant the assertion that our " system " integrates experience . But " basic " statements or " elementary " propositions , so we have already seen in previous sections , require context for their verification . Our whole argument , therefore , seems to be circular and the criterion of truth as illusive as ever . In view of this situation it becomes necessary to restate the whole case , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CASE So far our discussions have suffered from an ambiguity inherent in the very problem of truth ; for we have raised the questions of truth and the criterion of truth in a manner which implies that they are the same for all types of propositions , and this assumption is unwarranted.3 Consider , for example , the following propositions : 1 . A is not non-A. 2 . X is either A or non-A. 3 . All roses are plants . 4 . No squares are round . 5 . The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is equal to two right angles . 8 Cf. B. Blanshard , The Nature of Thought , II , Chapters XXV to XXVIII.  | 6. c2=a2+b2. 7 . This is a tree . 8 . Lincoln is the capital city of Nebraska . 9 . This is red . 10 . This is sour . In some way all of these statements may be regarded as true ; that is to say , we may accept them as " not erroneous . " But even a cursory examination reveals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least that they are not all " conformable to fact " in the same sense . The " warranty " of these beliefs is specifically different with respect to different propositions . Propositions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , for instance , find their warranty in the fact that their denial paralyzes all thought . If these propositions are not " true , " then intelligible thought is impossible and all thinking must come to an end . Propositions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , however , can not be proved in this manner . Their warranty lies in the definitional interrelation of their terms . Proposition ( 3 ) is " true " because ( a ) the meaning of plant ' is included in the meaning of rose , ' and ( la ) the proposition itself asserts this inclusion . Proposition ( 4 ) is " true " because ( a ) the meaning of round ' is , by definition , excluded from the meaning of square , ' and ( b ) the proposition itself asserts this exclusion . Proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an integral part of Euclidean geometry , i.e. , because it is a theorem which can be deduced with logical rigor from the postulates and definitions that provide the foundation for Euclidean geometry . Proposition ( 6 ) , in its geometrical sense , can be similarly derived from the same set of postulates and definitions , and in its algebraic sense it follows from a comparable set of " assumptions . " The warranty of propositions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) is therefore furnished by the systemic whole of which they are integral parts . Propositions ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) are essentially " hypotheses " the " truth " of which can be established only by " confirmation . " Propositions ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , finally , are " basic " statements pertaining to sensedata . Their warranty may be found in the immediately experienced qualia of first-person experience . If , in view of this variety of warranty , the term " truth " is to be retained , then this term can not really mean " conformable to fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ) can in some sense be said to be " conformable to fact . " The other propositions are " true " without  | reference to " facts . " Their warranty is given in types of relations which are independent of " things " and " sense-data " and other concrete contents of first-person experience . Henceforth , we shall identify " truth " with " warranted belief " and , therefore , with " knowledge . " " Truth " is warranted belief , and " warranted belief " is truth . The modes of warranty are then secondary , and the degree of warranty , i.e. , the certainty of knowledge ? varying as it does from unquestionable certainty of a belief to an almost complete lack of support for a belief ? becomes an intelligible and manageable factor . As far as the modes of warranty are concerned , propositions ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) represent semantic and syntactical truth . They represent , in other words , a type of knowledge the warranty of which is given in the meaning of terms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 6 ) are examples of systemic truth . That is to say , they exemplify knowledge which derives its warranty from the logical interdependence of all integral elements in a deductive system . Propositions ( 7 ) to ( 10 ) are instances of empirical truth . Their warranty may be said to stem from a " confirmatory " relation to specific qualia of first-person experience . Closer inspection reveals that the three types of truth or modes of warranty here referred to share at least one characteristic feature . In one form or another they all involve an appeal to coherence . In the case of " systemic truth " this dependence upon coherence is most obvious ; for warranty here means " being logically demonstrable " or " being derivable from " stipulated premises . The " truths " of pure mathematics , for example , are all theorems derivable from certain definitions and postulates . Their warranty lies exclusively in this relation of logical dependence and entailment , i.e. , it lies in the systemic context , in the logical coherence of the system . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to coherence is also evident . Propositions of the type exemplified by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , i.e. , propositions which constitute an indispensable pre ; supposition of intelligible thought , must be accepted as true because the consequence of their assumed falsity paralyzes all thought and makes thinking impossible ; whereas propositions of the type exemplified by ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , i.e. , so-called analytic propositions , must be accepted as true because of the interdependence of meanings and because of the rules of logic and grammar ( the rules of syntax ) which govern their construction . They are true , in other words , be-  | cause of the language employed . Arguments based upon consequences or upon the nature of language are , however , appeals to context or coherence ; for they appeal to a system . When we turn to empirical truths , it may be helpful to keep in mind the distinction between propositions ? such as ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) ? which are of an essentially hypothetical nature , and propositions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are " basic " statements . That the truth of the former can be established only through an appeal to context or coherence is obvious ; for " confirmation " through the verification of consequents is unthinkable without recourse to coherence . A proposition of this type can be regarded as " true " only when it entails " basic " statements which are " true , " i.e. , when it " coheres " with these statements . If I assert , for example , " This is a blue jay , " the proposition entails numerous other propositions , some of which pertain to the nature of birds and of animals in general , while others pertain to the nature of flight , to color and plumage and to the piercing shriek of the jays . If all these entailed propositions ? or still other propositions entailed by them ? can be accepted as " true , " then the original proposition , " This is a blue jay , " is " confirmed " and may be accepted as true , i.e. , as warranted belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of the original assertion . The more complex that assertion is , that is to say , the longer the sequence of logical entailments which connects it with " basic " statements , or the further removed from " direct observation " it is , the more evident is the fact that its truth depends on coherence ( cf. Blanshard ) . But what about the " basic " statements ? What , in other words , about propositions ? such as ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ? which are concerned directly with qualia of first-person experience ? The answer to this question has for the most part been anticipated in our discussions of " selfevident " truths and of the " correspondence " theory of truth . The following facts , brought out in those earlier discussions , may be summarized here for the sake of clarity : ( a ) All propositions dealing with sense-data are synthetic . In and through them a specific " this " is subsumed under a universal . ( b ) The very act of identifying a datum as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought ; for such an act involves discrimination and selection . ( c ) At least some propositions pertaining to sense-data are demonstrably not selfevident but can be proved true only through " confirmatory evidence , " i.e. , through consistency with other propositions . ( d ) All propositions  | pertaining to sense-data are , in principle , subject to error and may be false . They require , therefore , in principle , confirmatory evidence . ( e ) This evidence is their consistency with other propositions pertaining to the qualia of immediate experience . All of which means that here , as in the case of all other types of propositions , the ultimate criterion of truth is coherence and contextual consistency ( cf. Blanshard ) . It may be objected that this interpretation of truth can never yield truth because we have no secure anchorage to which to tie our " merely coherent " system . Professor Ducasse , for instance , would make this very point . I believe , however , that the objection is not fatal to the coherence theory . The quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support is misdirected in matters of factual knowledge . All knowledge of things is relative , and the truth it embodies is relative truth . But this is exactly what we should expect on the basis of the coherence theory . The argument that " mere coherence " can never be a test for empirical truth would unquestionably be decisive were it not for the fact that propositions pertaining to immediately experienced sense qualia enter into the context of coherent propositions . The " validation " of each and every one of these " basic " propositions can be achieved , in principle , only through context with other propositions of their kind . That is to say , only when all propositions pertaining to specific sensedata form a self-consistent " set " can each one of them , taken as individual , be regarded as true . The objection to the coherence theory of truth , I believe , stems from the conviction that isolated propositions , qua isolated , must be " verifiable . " This conviction , however , rests upon an untenable assumption ; for " isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intelligible thought . Each and every statement that conveys any meaning at all does so only because of a context of which it is an integal part . Its context , i.e. , its coeiT'rence with other propositions , can not even be denied without being reaffirmed in the denial ; for the denial must be either an appeal to an entailed contradiction or an appeal to an entailed incoherence . But in so far as it is an appeal to an entailment , it is also an appeal to coherence or context . CONCLUDING REMARKS It is clear , I believe , that the coherence theory of truth is in complete harmony with the thesis , developed in Chapter II , that meaning  | is essentially a matter of context and also with the thesis , developed in Chapter III that knowledge results from a systemic integration of first-person experience . If a progressive integration of the qualia of immediate experience and the construction of a " pattern " of interdependent " things " are the cardinal features of cognition , then it would be strange indeed if coherence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More important is , of course , the fact that the coherence theory is in harmony also with the practices and procedures in science and philosophy . Philosophical " dialectics , " as a method of clarifying ideas , is without question a matter of coherence ; and scientific methods of verification are impossible without recourse to context . The " data of observation " are already conceptually integrated when they become evidence for or against a given theory , and their integration means that they have been taken up into a context of ideas . Prior to such integration no " datum " is or can be " evidence , " for it does not even exist as a distinctly discerned and identified " this . " An example or two will make this clear . The measurable change in the mass of a body , though in itself a fixed and determinable quantity disclosed by observation , verifies either the proposition , " This body is at rest , " or the proposition , " This body moves with such and such an acceleration . " Einstein 's principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general theory of relativity , clearly shows that what is important here is not the observed change in mass as such but its conceptual integration as " gravitational " or " inertial " mass , respectively . If this example seems to involve too much " theory , " consider the pattern of dark and light rings on a photographic plate which the physicist obtains when he sends certain rays through a thin celluloid film . This visual evidence verifies either the proposition , " The rays in question consist of waves , " or the proposition , " The rays in question consist of particles . " What we see is in either case an unchanging pattern of dark and light rings in concentric arrangement ; the difference lies in the conceptual integration of this pattern , in its identification as a specific kind of a " this . " If it is taken to be an " interference " pattern , then the rays involved are undulatory X-rays ; but if it is taken to be a " diffraction pattern of electrons , " the rays are streams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only our conceptual integration of what we " see " is at all significant  | and has any bearing upon the truth or falsity of the respective propositions . If sense-data as such , i.e. , separated from all conceptual context , were a sufficient criterion of truth , the whole procedure of the sciences might be different ; for many of the troubles which now beset scientific inquiry arise from the fact that the " same " sense qualia are reconcilable with , or " verify , " many different propositions . Only the coherence theory of truth , depending as it does upon the conceptual integration of sense-data , gives an adequate account of scientific procedures and provides a criterion of truth which remains dependable despite the inherent ambiguities of " mere " sense qualia . The ideal , the goal , toward which all cognition moves , is the achievement of one comprehensive system of logically interdependent propositions ? a system , however , which at all crucial points implies propositions of the form , " This is such and such a quale of firstperson experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system or at least with that part or fragment of the system which so far has emerged as the result of our integration of experience . If a new experience can not be integrated with the accepted fragment of the anticipated system , i.e. , if it is inconsistent with it , if it does not " cohere " with it , the fragment must be re-integrated until consistency and coherence have been achieved . That such " revolutionary " experiences do occur is evident from the history of science ; that they provide stimuli for cognitive processes is also evident from that same history . The discoveries of electricity , of the constancy of the velocity of light , and of radioactive disintegration of atoms illustrate the point . Opponents of the coherence theory may now argue that the very fact that " revolutionary " discoveries may lead to a discarding of theretofore accepted systems of interrelated propositions proves that coherence is not really the criterion of truth ; for if it were , the coherent system should prevail against the isolated proposition stating the new observation . The force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " isolated " proposition does not exist . The " proposition " asserting the new discovery is in itself a contextual " complex , " a fragment of a system ; for it entails numerous propositions of different kinds , and is consistent with still others . The issue , therefore , is this : Which is more disastrous to our ideal of cognition , to adhere to the accepted fragment of an anticipated system and to exclude the set of proposi-  | Lions which contradicts the systemic projection , or to modify our projection of the system as a whole to such an extent as to accommodate within it both the hitherto accepted fragment of knowledge and the newly indicated fragment ? So long as we are not in possession of the whole truth , i.e. , so long as we have not achieved a complete and coherent integration of the whole of experience , so long as the " system as a whole " is but an anticipation or projection , there is nothing sacrosanct about any particular fragment of the projected system . That is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any partial integration can be accepted only subject to future revision . The idea of coherence , far from failing as a criterion in this situation , becomes itself one of the mainsprings compelling us to revise and revise again the fragmentary knowledge of the moment until the whole is within our grasp ( cf. Blanshard ) . Finally , if integration of first-person experience is the only available way to an understanding of reality , as I believe that it is , then only the completed system of interdependent propositions which integrates the whole of that experience and which excludes nothing which is in any way present in that experience , is at all adequate as a description or interpretation of reality . It , and it alone , is the true story of the real . And in this sense truth and reality stand revealed as projected systems ; the completion of one is the fulfillment of the other . Every fragmentary achievement in the system which is truth reveals at least that much of the real ; and every understanding of the real is disclosed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | In so far as knowledge pertains to subject matter it has its material aspects ; but in so far as it is formulated in propositions and chains of propositions , it has its formal aspects as well . These formal aspects of knowledge , the logico-syntactical rules which govern the use of words and the interrelations of propositions , constitute the subject matter of logic and , in an extended sense , of mathematics . We shall examine them in this and the following chapter , paying special attention to the basic problems of " grounds " and " justification " of inference , and of logical or mathematical " construction . " We begin with a discussion of traditional logic . THE BASIC " LAWS OF THOUGHT " For purposes of this discussion a general knowledge of traditional or Aristotelian logic is assumed . Our problem is to determine the various elements which provide the foundation for this type of inference and which guarantee its validity . Inference in all its forms presupposes meaning ? although , of course , the specificality of meaning may vary greatly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon the interrelation of concretely defined concepts ; at the other extreme we deal with abstract symbols or , if you prefer , with universal variables , which have no specific meaning whatever . The inference from " All roses are plants , " to " Some roses are plants " is of the first type ; the inference " ( p q ) . ( q r ) ( p r ) " represents the second type . But even this latter type presupposes meaning ; for if anything at all is to be inferred from the arrangement of " symbols , " each symbol must be appropriately defined : the letters p , ' q , ' and as representing " propositions " ; the symbols D ' and . ' as meaning " implies " and " and , " respectively . Meaningless marks on paper , such as these , 52 - O 4 n. , provide no basis for inference . Logic , therefore , can not be reduced to a manipulation of meaningless marks on paper ; it is and remains always an operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , then the most general laws governing the employment of " signs , " i.e. , the most basic laws governing the definition , fixation , and manipulation of meanings , must be the very laws which provide the broad foundations of all logic . In an earlier chapter I have shown that the fixation or definition of any particular meaning implies an inescapable commitment to the law of identity : A is A. The meaning defined is identical with itself and means what it is defined as meaning . This first law , however , entails a second which , by virtue of this entailment , is equally inescapable , namely , the law of contradiction : A is not non-A . The meaning defined is what it is and not what it is not . Lastly , if a meaning has been defined , then any particular object of experience is either part of that meaning or it is not : X is either A or non-A . There is no third alternative . The law of excluded middle , in other words , is also inescapably entailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intelligibility and meaning are impossible without the three traditional " Laws of Thought " ; and in so far as logic presupposes meaning it can escape neither their force nor their scope . PROPOSITIONS AND CONCEPTS To the extent to which knowledge is concerned with subject matter , thought is dependent upon concepts and their interrelations . But , as we have seen in Chapter II , concepts are rules for the integration of experience and , as rules , they are inherently propositions . To think of a red rose or a tall man is to think of a rose as being red , or of a man as being tall , where the word being ' is but a formal element making more explicit the relation of the subject and the predicate asserted in the original phrase . From such formulations it is a small step to propositions of the type , " This rose is red , " or , " This man is tall . " The increased formalization transforms the word being ' into the purely formal copula and changes the respective substantives and adjectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole process shows that in thought we effect a severance between substantive and adjective ; that we treat them as independently represented ; and that we unite them again in the asserted proposition . The proposition as a whole , therefore , is a unit of meaning formally explicated ; and the concept is a proposition in nuce . What is a concept at one level of reasoning may well be a proposition at some other level . It all depends on how complex the units of  | thought are with which we are concerned . The two propositions , " This red rose is beautiful , " and , " This rose is red , " both concern " this red rose " ; but the unit of thought which is taken as in itself complete and which is explicated in the proposition , " This rose is red , " is but a conceptualized element in the more complex unit of thought expressed by the proposition , " This red rose is beautiful . " THE PRIMARY RELATIONS OF PROPOSITIONS Once we explicate units of meaning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to various other propositions , and that its relation to these propositions is such that the truth ( or falsity ) of any one of them affects the truth ( or falsity ) of all others in a definite and determinable way . The relations here involved we shall call the primary relations of propositions . Before discussing these relations themselves let us agree upon certain formal matters which will facilitate both presentation and communication . In the discussions which follow I shall assume that the meaning of the word equivalence ' ( symbolically expressed by = ) is understood , and that it is taken as ultimate . I shall assume , furthermore , that the meaning of the word not ' ( symbolically represented by N ) is likewise understood , and it , too , is accepted as ultimate . Lastly , I shall use small letters of the alphabet , p , q , r , . . . , as variables representing propositions . Let us now consider one of the formal relations of propositions ? the relation of conjunction . It will be symbolized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' must , of course , be distinguished from the purely enumerative and ' of ordinary discourse . When we merely enumerate propositions , each enumerated statement retains its logical independence and may be true or false regardless of the truth or falsity of the other enumerated propositions . But when we conjoin two or more propositions , they fuse into one unitary meaning so that only the conjunctive product as a whole is either true or false . The falsity of any one of the conjoined " elements " implies the falsity of the conjunctive whole . The relationship expressed by the conjunctive and ' is subject to at least three additional laws : ( 1 ) the " reiterative law " : p and p = p ; ( 2 ) the " commutative law " : p and q = q and p ; ( 3 ) the " associative law " : ( p and q ) and r = p and ( q and r ) . These laws may seem trivial and void of philosophical significance , but they must be accepted  | if thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first law stipulates that the meaning or content of a proposition is unaffected by a reassertion of that proposition . The second law states that the meaning of a proposition is independent of the order among propositions . And the third law asserts that the content of a proposition is indifferent to any specific grouping of propositions . Now , if two propositions ( p , q ) and their negations ( ? p , ? q ) are considered , four specific conjunctive combinations are possible : ( 1 ) p and q ; ( 2 ) p and ? q ; ( 3 ) Np and q ; and ( 4 ) ? p and ? q . If each of these four conjunctions is negated , the resultant statements are the logical equivalents of four other types of compound propositions , namely : ( 1 ) ? ( p and q ) = not both p and q ( the disjunctive proposition ) ; ( 2 ) ? ( p and ? q ) = if p then q ( the direct implicative proposition ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if q then p ( the counter-implicative proposition ) ; ( 4 ) ? ( ? p and ? q ) either p or q ( the alternative proposition ) . Furthermore , each of the non-conjunctive composite propositions can be expressed equally well in any of the three other forms . We thus obtain the following equivalences : If p then q = If ? q then ? p = Not both p and .  --  q = Either ? p or q . If p then ? q = If q then ? p = Not both p and q = Either p or  --  q . If ? p then q = If ? q then p = Not both ? p and ? q = Either p or q . If ? p then , - , q ? If q then p Not both ? - gyp and q = Either p or ? q . If one of these propositions is true , then all propositions equivalent to it are also true . Still other primary relations among propositions become evident when we examine categorical propositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle , namely , the principle of " double negation , " according to which a double negation is equivalent to an affirmation , we can " obvert " any given proposition and still preserve the identity of its meaning . " All S is P " now becomes " No S is non-P " ; " No S is P " becomes " All S is non-P " ; " Some S is P " becomes " Some S is-not non-P " ; and " Some S is-not P " becomes " Some S is non-P . " If the given proposition is true , its obverse is also true . Propositions may also be " converted " ; that is to say , their terms may be interchanged without a change in the quality of the proposition as a whole . An equivalence of meaning is again preserved . In the case of the E and the I propositions the process is a " simple conversion "  | and is accomplished by means of the commutative law for conjunctives , thus : E propositions : No S is P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S and P = Nothing is P and S ? Nothing that is P is S = No P is S. I propositions : Some S is P Something that is S is P Something is S and P Something is P and S Something that is P is S = Some P is S. In the case of the A and the 0 propositions conversion can not be carried out in this simple manner . In both types of propositions S and P differ in their respective extensions , and this difference interrupts the simple chain of equivalences . In the case of the 0 proposition the interruption is irreparable and , in consequence , an 0 proposition can not be converted . In the case of the A proposition we can overcome the difficulty by a specific limitation of the scope of the proposition . The chain of transformation then becomes this : All S is P ? Everything that is S is P ( ? ) Some things are S and P Some things are P and S ? Something that is P is S = Some P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equivalence indicated by ( ? ) as acceptable . Other transitions are not subject to such ambiguities . The A and the 0 propositions , for example , may become parts of the following chains : A propositions : All S is P Everything that is S is P ? Nothing that is S is non-P = Nothing is S and non-P = Nothing is non-P and S ? Nothing that is non-P is S = Everything that is non-P is non-S ? All non-P is non-S. 0 propositions : Some S is-not P Not everything that is S is P Something that is S is non-P Something is S and non-P Something is non-P and S ? Something that is non-P is S = Not everything that is non-P is non-S = Some non-P is non-S . In both cases we have obtained the " contraposition " of the original proposition . The truth or falsity of one of the constituent propositions is the truth or falsity of the whole chain . All chains of propositions so far considered presuppose , in addition to the three " Laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the idea of negation and the idea of equivalence ? and two laws or principles of logic ? the commutative law and the principle of double negation . But , of course , these chains of " reasoning " also lead to
