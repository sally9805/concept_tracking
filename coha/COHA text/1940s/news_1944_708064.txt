txt A substantial movement to rescind the union 's no-strike pledge confronted delegates to the convention of the United Automobile Workers , largest CIO affiliate , as they assembled here today for the opening session tomorrow . The movement has the support of many of the union 's locals . The 2,300 delegates representing more than 1,000,000 members will have before them problems affecting vitally the union 's present and future as the specter of possible mass unemployment looms with the prospect of large cutbacks in war production soon . The seriousness of the movement for abrogation of the nostrike pledge was admitted by union leaders as President R. J. Thomas and members of the executive board were preparing to hold the line against any such action . Leading the movement is a group headed by John J. of Buick Local 529 , Flint . Backing in All Factions This group had recruited adherents from all factions of the union , it was said , and had made much progress recently with the contention that jettisoning of the no-strike pledge would place the union in a stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seniority rights and maintenance of wage and hour standards . Cutting across factions , with which the UAW abounds , and with an issue carrying a strong appeal to a large part of the rank and file , the group threatens to stampede a majority of the convention . Mr. Thomas and his chief lieutenants , however , appear confident of their ability to check the movement . They will have the assistance of Philip Murray , president of the CIO , Secretary of the Interior Ickes and Sidney Hillman , chairman of the CIO Political Action Committee , who are scheduled to address the ' convention before the issue is brought on the floor . Mr. Ickes , representing the Administration , will address the convention Tuesday evening . President Roosevelt is expected to send a message of greeting in which , it is reported , he will appeal for continued uninterrupted production . give assurance of orderly reconversion and hold out the promise of adequate protection to laid-off workers . UAW leaders say that their union faces perhaps a more serious unemployment problem than any other union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of possible I loss of 50 per cent in membership.1 Post-war jobs and adequate unem employment benefits during reconver-1 sion and the larger problem of post-war reorganizations of the automobile and aircraft industries will , therefore , occupy a leading place on the convention discussion . Plane Plants Problem Acute As nearly half of the union 's ' membership is employed in aircraft plants . These plants are expected ' I to present the most serious aspect ' of the post-war unemployment , problem for the union . In a pre-convention radio ad-I dress today Mr. Thomas stressed the unemployment question , charging that " thus far no adequate steps have been taken to assure jobs for either returned soldiers or those of us who have served at home in recent years in our aircraft , ammunition and gun plants . " He assailed Congress for turning down the Kilgore-Murray bill , which , he said , " held some hope for cushioning the post-war years by providing adequate unemployment insurance during the reconversiofi period , retraining of workers and furnishing them with means of transportation from centers of unemployment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not understand and I do not think our returned soldiers will understand the reasoning which motivated the defeat of the Kilgore bill and its provisions for a measure of post-war security , " he declared . " The farmers have been provided for . The corporations have been provided for . The Government has assured the farmers of parity prices for some time after the war . " Congress , in the 1944 tax bill , has assured corporations of substantial tax rebates should they fail- to earn sufficient profits in the post-war years . Why has less than that been done for our workers and soldiers ? Says Answer Is Demanded " That is one question which our convention , speaking for 1,000,000 members and 300,000 more in the armed services , will want to have answered . " The unemployment and organizational crisis confronting the union was emphasized in the financial report prepared for the convention by George F. Addes , secretary-treasurer . He declared that the union should have a reserve fund of $5,000,000 on hand before the war ends , but that it would be impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the membership to approve recommendations for an increase in dues . He reported a membership of 1,047,227 , an increase of 331,845 in the year , with income for the year at $6,251,310 and expenditures at ' $5,389,345 . He put the " net worth " of the union at $2,512,277 , with liquid assets of $2,167,735 , a sum he called I inadequate to meet the problems the union was facing . He again urged that dues be increased to 1$1.50 a month . " As time goes by we are getting more and more evidence that industry is preparing for a bitter struggle with organized labor after the war , " Mr. Addes asserted . " Very few managements have accepted organized labor in good ' faith . When major differences can not be ironed out around the conference table we must be prepared to stand up individually and collectively for our just rights . In all such cases organized labor will have to once again make full use of our most potent weapon , the right to strike . We have the strong and militant membership . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury . " Clash on Dues Is Possible A formal recommendation by union officers that the union undertake immediately to establish a larger fund for post-war use is expected to arouse heated discussion in view of the hostility shown by the rank and file of delegates at previous conventions to increase of dues . Of major interest also - is the movement launched with the support of Mr. Thomas for the addition of a third vice president to the union 's list of officers as a means of strengthening the precarious balance of power now held by Mr. Thomas between the Communistsupported faction of Mr. Addes and Vice President Richard T. Frankensteen on one side and Walter Reuther on the other . Richard T. Leonard , head of the union 's Ford division , is supported by Mr. Thomas for the third vicepresidency . While Communist elements in the Addes camp favor the movement for the new office , Mr. Addes is reported to be opposed to it and Mr. Reuther is withholding support pending a pledge by Mr. Leonard that he would back the Reuther group on vital questions of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election of Mr. Leonard to the third vice-presidency as a means of weakening the antiCommunist influence of the Reuther faction . Addes Reported Opposed Mr. Addes is opposed to the plan on the reported ground that a third vice presidency would vitiate his strength in relation to Mr. Reuther , who at last year 's convention came close to defeating Mr. Addes for his present post by running Mr. Leonard against him . Mr. Thomas is said to favor a third vice presidency as a means of building his own group in the union in preparation for the expected post-war period of organizational storm and stress . Mr. Thomas has been affiliated with no faction , deriving his strength from his personal influence in the organization . The election of a third vice president supporting Mr. Thomas would , it is believed , reduce the influence of both the Addes and Reuther factions in the national executive board and strengthen that of Mr. Thomas . Mr. Murray is represented as favoring the Thomas proposal . Should the delegates vote down the proposal of a third vice presidency , Mr. Leonard might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $7,000 a year , either against Mr. Reuther , with whom he appears to have broken since last year 's convention , or against Mr. Frankenstein or against both .
