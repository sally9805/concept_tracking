? ? GOOD NEIGHBORS A STORY BY STOYAN CHRISTOWE T tan old man  --  my Grandfather  --  lay on a straw mat inside the garden apiary . Near him was his time-worn cane , with its head shaped into a dragon , from whose jaws stuck out a once fiery tongue , now bearing no trace of the scarlet paint my Grandfather had put on it . The whole garden was teeming with life . The cherry trees had shed their pink and white blossoms and from their leaves peeped out jade-green beads . Embryo clusters , like green pompoms , protruded from the grape arbor entwined about the fence on the courtyard side of the garden . The bushes which ran from the house to the barn and shielded the garden on the outer side were bemantled with flowers and looked like garlands hanging from the necks of the old willows . Against the back of the house were the beehives , at least a score of them . Some were housed in cone-shaped hampers of osier , plastered with fresh cow dung , now dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rectangular wooden boxes which had come to the village with kerosene  --  in each box two square five-gallon cans , the word BATUM stamped on them . One hive was lodged in a truncated log , a little larger than a bushel-measure . My Grandfather had sawn off the log  --  with the bees in it  --  somewhere in the forest and had brought it here to become the progenitor of this ancient apiary . As if conscious of its age and dignity , and proud of its brood , the stump reposed patriarchlike amidst the hampers and boxes . With its bark peeled off and its knotty , bone-bleached surface , it suggested the knuckle of some gigantic prehistoric animal . On one of the knots Grandfather had hung a dog 's skull , whose polished surface blended with the wood itself . It was there to avert " evil eyes , " or rather to break their evil spell . To the exterior of this aboriginal hive , as well as to the exteriors of some others , now adhered clumps of bees , like huge clusters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families had established themselves out of doors to await a propitious moment for their swarming . The sun , the flowers , the warm day itself , had inspired the hives with incessant , feverish activity . The bees came out through the wax-trellised entrances of their toylike homes , twanged in the sunlit air , maneuvered about , and dashed off into the adjoining fields to forage . Soon they returned , gorged with nectar , and dropped . like bullets on the thresholds of the hives . Many bees warped and spun about us , and some even alighted on Grandfather 's bare head , or on his neck . He did not disturb them . I did n't remember that he was ever stung by a bee . And I used to see him shove his hands into heaps of them and pour them into " They were ? Well , there 's good and bad among them . A bad one must have attacked a good one and the good one had to defend itself . " " It looked like that , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nosing and poking about . It alighted near the fatal scene and walked about suspiciously . Then it approached the bees in the dust and , discovering them to be dead , it darted away toward the hives . This made me wonder if bees were capable of communicating information and I turned to ask Grandfather if such a thing might be true . But I noticed that he had his eyes fixed on the log hive with the dog 's skull on it . And looking out there , I saw that the ball of bees clinging to the outside was in its pre-swarming fermentations . The bees stirred like an army preparatory to an expedition , or a nation on the eve of exodus . They sputtered and popped much as corn roasting in a pan . And the whole clump of them , though still hanging together and to the wood , began to swell up into a huge blister . All at once the distending blister burst at one place and began to spout bees into the air in a continuous stream . A low , sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden . Flurries of bees shimmered in the sunlit air like a heat mirage . The birds in the trees and the bushes , with alarming chirrupings , fluttered away to quieter places . As the gushing spout effused the bees higher and higher into the air , the blister on the log shrank away . In ten minutes it dissolved into a myriad of dancing specks . It was a prodigious swarm . Grandfather stood beneath it knocking two stones against each other and chanting in a sweet beguiling voice . Already he had tied a bunch of daisies to a cherry-sprig in hopes the queen might be attracted to perch there . With all his bee-breeder 's cunning he importuned the queen-mother to settle on the twig . " Come darling . . . come sweet one . . settle . . . " The stones kept clacking in unvaried rhythm . Unmoved by the cantillations , the bees continued to swarm in the air . Standing there and watching Grandfather , I suddenly became aware of another deep , faint noise , like the drone of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that a swarm had also issued from our neighbor 's apiary . Like a conoidal , baseless tower , it reeled and wavered in the direction of our own swarm . Grandfather too must have seen it , for presently he cried out , " Pick up stones , child , and try to woo it the other way ! " I did as I was told . As best I could I endeavored to entice the swarm away from ours but , as if annoyed by my crude music , it trembled stationary above me for a few moments . Then , no doubt attracted by Grandfather 's incantations , it began to drift closer toward our swarm . Roused by the noise , our neighbor came out , wiping dough from her hands on her thick woolen apron . She too picked up stones and commenced the bewitching chant . " Come qucenie . . . come mother . . . this way , darling . . . . " As good a beekeeper as my Grandfather , with great skill she tried to charm her swarm away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inevitably toward our own . " They 'll mingle , " Grandfather quavered . " They 'll scythe one another to the last bee . " Children who came running from their play kept at a safe distance . At a distance also , Iest their " eyes " be blamed if the bees should intermingle and war , men and women leaned on wicker fences in their courtyards , furtively observing the coincidence . Like two balloons floating in the air and destined for collision , the swarms gyrated toward each other . Soon they touched , and instantly rebounded . But again they drew closer , and the next time they collided they began to fuse . The old man leaned on her fence and watched our neighbor place the box on a platform inside her garden . He was not angry , and kept on murmuring half to himself and half to her , " Too bad they had to go and get mixed up like that . But praise the Lord for keeping them from scrapping and cutting each other . " She paid no attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the box to keep the rain from dripping in . She laid stones over the tin strips to secure them against the wind and then she padded in her bare feet to the gate and disappeared into her house without having spoken a word . " It 's all right , " said the old man to mc . " It do n't make any difference where the hive sets . " He appeared composed , but I could tell that he was disturbed by the woman 's unneighborly behavior . He said nothing further about it . Throughout the rest of the summer he made no mention of the subject , though every now and then he did go over to our neighbor 's garden and lean on the fence to look at the common hive . Fall came , and with it the honey harvest . There was no more food in nature for the bees . Some of them still journeyed about , poked into the coarse , withered autumn flowers , even trooped as far as the vineyards in hopes of finding some hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all meant that they must now turn to their precious stores of honey , and that we must beat them to it . None of us had ever heard of glass hives or removable combs . To get the honey we had to kill the bees , by drowning . Every fall we would decide on the number of hives we wished to keep for " mothers , " and butcher the rest , as it were , except that we used the word " spoil " for it . We did the " spoiling " in the evenings , when the bees were numbed by the cold and it was easier to drown them . This particular fall we " spoiled " all but seventeen hives , which we retained for " mothers . " In the following summer every " mother " would swarm at least once , and some even twice and three times . In a good year it was not unusual even for a swarm to swarm . When we had finished the harvesting of our own honey Grandfather said , " Guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive to-night . " I did n't go with him and I did n't know just exactly how he broached the subject to her . But it was easy to tell what she said to him , for when he returned he was shaking with anger and kept repeating , in her own voice , " Old fool ! Hollow-headed old man ! What do you mean our hive ! It 's my hive . Why do n't you call your bees if you think there 's bees here that belong to you ? " He shook the cane 's dragon-head at me and told me to stop laughing . " What does she think bees are , anyway ? Sheep or pigs that you can call them to you ? " " Why quarrel , Grandfather ? It 's only a few pounds of honey . Let her have it . " " It 's not the honey . It 's the bees . You ca n't let your bees go . She wants to keep that hive for a mother . She wants to take away our bees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose your luck with what you keep . Did you ever hear of anyone selling a hive ? " And that was true . The only way you could start a new apiary was by finding a colony of honeybees in some hollow tree , as Grandfather had done . Or else by having some beekeeper donate a hive to you with grace and good will . Bees , it seemed , resented being sold , bartered , or appropriated , but did n't mind being made a gift of . In the evening , after supper , the old man said to me , " All right , my son , get the lantern and the steelyard . " " Where are we going ? " " We 're going to spoil that hive and take our share of the honey . " I lighted the way across the courtyard . It was a dark , cold , starless night .
