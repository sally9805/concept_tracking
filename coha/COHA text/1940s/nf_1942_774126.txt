txt  | QUANTITY FROM the foregoing chapter it may be seen that it is no simple matter to lay down the exact general specifications for kind and quantity of food for all human beings . As a nation we could hardly be classed as gluttonous but we are by no means starving ourselves . Those who ought to know contend that the average American who has an income above the mere subsistence level eats from 10 to 20 per cent more than he should for the best of health , Such ideas are not popular with the food producers , nor with those who live to eat . Our average diet may err slightly on the side of gluttony ? yet there are the dietetically stingy whose bird-like appetites tell them merely to peck at their plates and who seem to eat scarcely enough to maintain life . Some of the record performances of the past are practically unexplainable . The all-time low was reached in the record of Fedor Darapski , born in 1774 in Karskod , Poland . He was conscripted for the Russian Army at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die . The Empress Catherine commuted his sentence to life imprisonment . He was properly endungeoned and allowed two pounds of black bread and a jug of cold water per week . On his ninetieth birthday he was recommended for mercy and released because the mutiny had never amounted to anything anyway . It 's a good story but there are some calories missing from the record . His two pounds of bread per week were provid- ing him with less than 40o calories per day . If he had been starved down to a weight of Too pounds or less he would have had to have 1200 to 1300 calories per day even if he slept 12 hours and sat quietly in his cell the other 12 hours . Either ( a ) Russian black bread was much more powerful than any present bread , ( b ) he captured and ate rats in his cell , ( c ) some one has lied by at least 200 per cent or ( d ) the pound of bread referred to was more than twice as large as our present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There have been units of weight called a " pound " over twice as large as ours . We may be quite sure that the energy requirements of the human body are sufficiently constant to provide a rough standard of calibration for a unit of weight . But whatever the quantity , a man apparently did live by bread alone ? at least for 68 years . You may be certain that it was n't modern white bread . He would have died on that within a few months . A more credible performance is that of a fifteenth-century Venetian , Luigi di Cornaro , who restricted his food to lo ounces of dry material and 6 ounces of wine per day . Despite his meager table he had many friends , led a mentally active life which did not end until he reached the age of 102 years . This man , however , was receiving something more than 1200 calories per day ( considerably more if there were much fat in the dry food ) which might cover the basal requirements for a small individual . He became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry moments . For really spectacular performances , of shorter duration , one goes to the fasters . There are cultists who have the idea that something marvelous happens to you if you miss a couple of meals ; that you have entered the paradise of those who can live well and happily on nothing . Unfortunately for our pocketbooks , that is not true . No one has yet devised a way to beat down the energy and material  | demands of the body . There is the famous experiment of the farmer who was training one of his horses to live without food . He cut down the allotment day by day but just when he had the animal where it required no food at all , it died . If one goes for more than a relatively few hours without food he becomes autocannibalistic , and lives off his own flesh . First to be used are the carbohydrates stored as glycogen in the liver and tissues , then the fat is used to keep the machine going . Lastly the protein of the muscles and sinews heeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs . A person in good health and good flesh can live for a period of thirty to sixty days without food , but the basal energy demands of his system while he is starving remain almost as high as ever , and every bit of energy supplied can be accounted for by loss of body weight . The human body has mechanisms or patterns of action which take care of this autodigestion . The average man in good health has about 75,000 calories stored in the compounds of his body . If he starts on a regime of fasting these compounds supply the energy requirements . They would suffice to last him about 75 days if he lay at rest during the entire time and if death did not intervene . The world 's record for fasting is close to the ultimate possible performance . Like carnivorous animals some primitive peoples have lived by alternate gorging and starvation because the food supply was intermittent and uncertain . Darwin described in considerable detail the dietetic straits of the sea-side Patagonians . When something edible was washed ashore they fell to with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often as possible . Then followed periods of starvation until something else washed ashore . Undoubtedly the time between washings was often too long , even for a Patagonian . The gorgings were a matter of necessity . One had to eat the food when it came ? it would n't stay long . As the time  | lengthened out between feedings the weaklings died off , the survivors being only those who had the ability to live on their own stored-up tissues . We all seem to be constructed somewhat the same way . Men of fortitude have undergone prolonged fasts in the interest of science and kept careful records of the physiological effects . If you desire to duplicate their ordeals you will probably have similar findings . After you have missed your first meal you will have hunger pains . You will drink considerable water but you ca n't fool a stomach with mere water for very long . The pains will persist and will later be augmented by nausea . The first few days are the worst , however , and if you drink sufficient water ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without water ) the body settles down to its new routine within a week and there will be no particular discomfort except for the probable appearance of deficiency diseases and the insistent voice of hunger . There are said to be certain people with will power strong enough to resist this call . In the last stages of starvation even this ceases . If the experiment is not carried to the point of death you can start eating conservatively again , and gradually bring your body back to the old digestive routine . After a few weeks of careful feeding you will be back to normal with a partially rebuilt body ? you will have the same old heart , lungs , bones and nervous system but most of the muscles and flesh will be brand new ? though your rebuilt machinery is probably not quite as good as the old , for it has been through a severe strain . This fasting will be discussed further in the chapter " Gullible 's Travels . " If some people can live on astonishingly little food others can handle equally astonishingly large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephews wonder what the world is coming to , but the boys probably make good use of all they can get into their stomachs . A careful study of the food intake of the boys at St. Paul 's School showed that each of these little worthies ,  | ranging from thirteen to seventeen years of age , consumed on the average 5,000 calories per day . This was fully three times the basal energy requirement , but the boys made good use of it and they were neither over- nor underfed . St. Paul 's provides ( or at least used to provide ) a good table , and the students are active and in excellent health . Young hellions of either sex seldom overeat . If they cram down more than they should they usually expend it promptly in non-useful work . There is the occasional soft and pudgy pre-adolescent who eats too much of the wrong kind of food , or exercises too little , or has disarrangement of the glandular function ? probably all three and all interrelated . Though he may be classed as an exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , it is difficult to overstuff a boy . After thirty , things are different in many ways . The physique is already over the peak , the metabolic rate has dropped , the daily expenditure of energy invariably decreases ; the appetite , however , refuses to make the proper adjustment . From middle-age on everything of interest is either " illegal , immoral or fattening " ( Alexander Woollcott in one of his duller moments ) . The chances are that a touch of frugality would be as good for us as for our insurance companies . A New Englander of the 1830 's , writing in a contemporary periodical , seems to have found even the tables of that frugal region too well-filled for the good of man : " Long has my soul been grieved at the thought of the incalculable quantity of fish , fowl and flesh which is devoured daily by my countrymen . It may be stated that everyone in the United States eats one-fourth more than is good for them . Those not doing hard work indulge in abominable excesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a dinner party I see the incarnate forms of Gout , Apoplexy and Fever coaxing their victims to take one more slice ' ? If a man eat like a beast , what wonder his animal nature should triumph over his intellectual ... therefore the frequent sui- cides , madness , robberies , frauds and murders . .. . The evils entailed upon the world by the introduction of fire , arose in consequence of its application to culinary purposes . While men lived on acorns and water from a stream there was no temptation to eat too much , but when roast meat and strong waters came into use they brought crime , violence and war in their train . " Weighing all this , the author then proposed a " Society for the Suppression of Eating . " The duties and obligations of the Society were to be : ( 1 ) Obtain from the Massachusetts Medical Society a statement of the quantity of food most convenient for a healthy man . ( 2 ) Offer a premium for the best treatise setting forth the pernicious effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go without dinner once a week . ( q . ) No member shall eat more than once per day . ( 5 ) No member shall eat after eight at night . When last heard from , the Society was not flourishing . However depraved our modern habits , they are genteel compared to those of the good old days . Eating when one had the opportunity was an occupation to be pursued with gusto . Barkly in his Ecloges published in 1570 describes a dinner table thus : " If the dish be pleasant , either fleshe or fyshe , Ten hands at once swarm in the dishe : And if it be fleshe ten knives shalt thou see , Mingling in the fleshe and in the platter flee . To put there thy handes , is peril without fail ? Without a gauntlet , or else a glove of mail . " Present-day gluttony is not fraught with these particular dangers , but we have some creditable performers . So far as is known there is no world-champion all-round eater , though the press is continually proclaiming championships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest ( record 85 cups in 8 hours ) is good for half a column ; watermelon champion , one paragraph and an action picture . One William Mungy brought a championship to Palm Beach by drinking 8o ounces of beer in 45 seconds . Red Palmer brought honor to Alaska by downing 84 raw oysters in practically no time . Minnesotan Ed Kottwitz stripped the kernels off 5o ears of sweet corn at one sitting , while one Harry Kantor brought credit to Bloomfield , New Jersey , by consuming 8o large red peppers . Max Baer , sometime pugilistic champion , downed 5 pounds of steak in less than that many minutes . De Wolfe Hopper was the unquestioned cocoanut pie champion . These championships lend an unnecessary professional air to the sport of eating . The amateurs of the past who ate merely for the love of it had better sustained performances and managed to do a few other things as well . Charles V of Spain " breakfasted at five on a fowl seethed in milk , sugar and spices . Went back to sleep . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every repast with large draughts of beer and wine . His stomach succumbed after forty years of such labors .... At S5 he was already decrepit with premature old age . He was crippled in his hands , knees and legs . He had always been addicted to eating and talking . It was now impossible for him to bring together the fragments of the teeth which still remained . " Emperor Gaius Julius Verus Maximinus ( 235 ? 38 A. D. ) could and did eat 40 pounds of meat and drink 6 gallons of wine in one day . He did n't last long . Clodius Alvinus , commander of Romans in Gaul , ate , at one sitting , so it is said , 50o figs , zoo peaches , 10 melons , 20 pounds of raisins , ' co snipes , 10 capons , ' so large oysters , but it did n't seem to injure his fighting qualities . Gluttonous generals are not always so fortunate . Primitive peoples with their practice in alternate stuffing  | and starving can turn in some very acceptable performances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four children ) was observed in action upon a large zebra . Between sunrise and sunset they disposed of all the meat , marrow and intestines . During the night they picked the bones and no army of ants could have left them cleaner . A Tartar courier , one ThuyKasr , boasted and verified that he had eaten " unassisted and without employment of witchcraft " a large skinful of raisins and a middle sized pig , leaving nothing but bristles and a few of the larger bones . Certain Arab princes were in the habit of holding feasts for their subjects and according to one account : " Two Military officers , Ibn Faiz and Ed-Deylemee , distinguished themselves at these feasts . Each used to eat a baked sheep , ten fowls , ten pounds of sweetmeats . One had been a prisoner and won his freedom by winning a bet to eat a calf weighing several hundred pounds . Another man commenced his repast ( in the presence of Dr. Boehmen , of Wittenberg ) by eating a raw sheep and a suckling pig and by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all . " After that there is simply nothing more to say . This survey of the antipodes of diet indicates that the human animal can survive more abuse than any other machine . There are a multitude of mechanisms which the body uses to protect itself from its master . It may be as simple as an automatic case of vomiting or of diarrhea , which often occurs when objectionably decayed food gets to the stomach or intestines ; it may be an adjustment of the balance among the ductless gland secretions to take care of an incipient diabetic . The body employs many methods of protest . Most direct is the juvenile cholera morbus ( stomach ache ) , which is the close attendant of green apples . Aching joints , gout , decaying teeth , heavy incidence of colds , gas , indigestion , headaches , are often red warning flags waved in dietary protest . Obesity may lead to a number of degenerative processes which result in premature death , but ,  | in general , overeating is much more pleasant than starving . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity and makes the kings whimper ? gout . Though the race is not as gouty as it once was the disease is by no means written off the books . It is a form of arthritis , if arthritis is defined in broad enough terms , which brings about severe and painful inflammation of the joints , often attended by severe festering . There may or may not be a specific organism localized at the point of suffering ? the medics refuse to agree on the matter ,  --  - but the primary cause is too much and improper food . The old-time cleric firmly believed that the disease was a direct visitation of the Lord in retribution for prolonged high-living . There is no doubt about the visitation , but it is the digestive mechanism that is involved and not the Lord . The metabolic upset seems to be primarily associated with an excess of uric acid , which is brought about or at least aggravated by a diet high in the class of proteins that form the materials called purines . Britain of Good King Hal 's time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the diet . Ample rest , sufficient fluid intake for effective purging , and proper diet eventually can relieve the most stubborn cases . " Watering places " are merely convenient spots for wasting money . Rest , water , and proper food can be obtained much more economically at home . The average English diet is still abominable , but at least it is an improvement and gout is not as prevalent . The experimental work of the last half century is finally beginning to make itself felt and the public is becoming dimly aware that there is virtue in the control of diet , that there is reasonably exact knowledge on the whys and wherefores of foods and that it is important to know not only how much to eat but also what to eat . The next sections deal more specifically with the kind of things which should be put into the stomach .  | THE BIG THREE WHEN the experiments of the organic chemists of a century ago sent the idea of " one universal aliment " to limbo , indisputable evidence was presented that three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are necessary for the maintenance of animal life . They are the energy producers and the tissue builders . Though they must be supplemented by a long array of small amounts of other substances , the bulk of our food is made up of these three materials . CARBOHYDRATES Carbohydrates commonly occur as starch or sugar . The chief function of starches and sugars in our lives is to produce energy . If we assimilate them and then do n't utilize their potential energy in muscular effort , they are stored , usually as fat , and in the most inconvenient locations in the body . If ordinary cane-sugar molecules are eaten they are split in two to give the simple sugars , glucose and fructose . Starches end up as glucose , too . The grist is all ground down to the same size . In the body metabolism , fats and carbohydrates play more or less interchangeable roles , but it is generally considered that health is best served if 40 to 50 per cent , of the total energy value of the food be in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of fats . There is a continuous corn syrup ? cane-sugar rivalry that is worth a moment . Corn syrup is essentially glucose and  | dextrin , the stuff the body uses , plus a little water . Corn sugar is crystallized glucose . Cane-sugar marketers hate glucose because it is n't their product . They damn it as cheap sugar and hence ( by implication ) dangerous and undesirable . They have managed to give glucose a bad name and the public always associates glucose with cheap and inferior candy or baked goods . A lump of cane-sugar , however , is converted into glucose within a few minutes after it enters the body . But where would the cane-sugar advertisers be if they broadcast that fact ? Some of the manufacturers of cheap candy are now giving themselves a new deal from the dictionary . They have dusted off someone 's old organic chemistry and looked up a few names . They advertise their candy ( 29 cents per pound or thereabouts ) as containing " dextrose , that new healthgiving sugar which the body uses " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of glucose which is in corn syrup . It 's the same cheap candy but it has a new ( and hence valuable ) health ingredient by virtue of a bit of dictionary work . To your stomach they 're all the same only your pocketbook can tell the difference . The world is gradually going carbohydrate . That is because there are more people than there have ever been before ( one would like to add " or ever will be again " ) so there must be more food . You can get about eight times as many calories from an acre of corn as you can from the flesh of pigs fed on this same corn . Because of population pressure , certain sections of the world are progressively using more of vegetable and less of animal materials . This means that the carbohydrates , from sugar and cereals particularly , are increasing steadily in quantity . One does not need to view this with alarm , but it is not amiss to point out that this tendency is not the best road to health . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low in the essentials we must have for good health . If the proportion of carbohy- drates is high then the amount of something else of greater importance is low . Nutrition is a six-way teeter-totter . Have you ever tried to balance such a device ? FATS Decaying wood , which contains no fat of any sort , sometimes supports very rotund and very fat worms . Neither water , air nor soil on which plants grow contain fatty substances , but a great many plants have large percentages of fats in their make-up . Animals , human beings included , take in sugars and starches and store the excess as fat . The ability to make fats from carbohydrates or similar materials seems to be a characteristic of most living matter , including plants . But man has n't been able to perform this task in the laboratory , even when armed with all the equipment and knowledge in the world . The microscopic walls of plant cells house much better laboratories than our scientists have yet been able to devise . It would be very interesting if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when sugar is selling for five cents a pound and butter for fifty cents , the interest might be considerably more than academic . There are eminent chemists who say that man will never be able to manufacture fats from sugars , but the younger men do n't all feel that way . Some bright day someone will find out just how the plants do it and then it wo n't be long until some experimenter turns the trick in the laboratory . The greasy foods perform some very important functions in our animal lives and nothing can pinch-hit for them ; to do without them can be dangerous . Fats form a protective layer around the nerves , apparently to cushion those delicate wires from undue shock . One of the characteristic results of semi-starvation is extreme irritability . It has been suspected that this may be due to the depletion of cushioning fat around the nerves . Malnourishment in children or in rats always brings about extreme spurts of nervous activity .  | The weazened street tough of eight or ten years may not be a good citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something , even though by almost any criterion or observation his filod intake is insufficient . The activity is not a sign of improved he ; dt h on a restricted diet . The stimuli arising from a tat deficiency around the nerves are misleading indications of an energy supply that does not exist . In such cases the nervous activity does n't have the physique to back it up . The active though undernourished individual never has the endurance of the normal being ; resistance to disease is less and if he is not fully grown he is probably headed for many maladies in adult life . Eats in the form of their derived compounds ? phospholipins ? also play an important part in our brain and entire nervous system . One really does not care to starve his brain . Another class of compounds derived from the fats and known as the sterols are also essential for the living organism . It is by no means tampering with the truth to say that , in its higher forms , life without fat is impossible . Arctic-explorer Stefansson found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fat . On an all-leanmeat diet he became violently ill within a week . Even admitting these facts , however , one might argue that they do not prove that a diet should contain any large amount of fat , for we make fat out of the carbohydrate we take in , hence starches and sugars might be all that would be necessary to supply energy and fill our fat warehouse . As an argument this is unanswerable ? but as an observation of facts it is a hundred per cent wrong . There are fats and fats and the human body is quite unable to meet the fat-manufacturing situation by itself . There are some necessary fats that our refined bodies refuse to , or can not , manufacture and we need to call on other animals , such as cows , to help us out . Moreover , without fats in the diet we could not get a sufficient amount of the fat-soluble vitamins , A , D and E.  | The investigation of fats in this country usually takes the form of sporadic skirmishes between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Japan are countries that are distressingly short on animal fats and so conduct frequent investigations into the nutritional sufficiency of the vegetable fats and oils , or margarines . The results of investigations may be summed up as a museum of conflicting findings , and , as is unfortunately often true , the character of the results tends to lean in the direction of the wishes of the investigator . But of this much there is no doubt : there are two fatty acids , linoleic and linolenic , which the body must have and which it can not manufacture itself . These fatty acids get their names from linseed oil , in which they were first discovered . There are very good indications that there are several other fats and fatty acids which are essential and which we do not make in our bodies , but no laboratory man has yet been able to put his pencil on another formula and say : This , also , is a substance which we must have . It has also been found to be generally true that these not only desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater proportion than in vegetable fats . But it is also true that a passable diet can be concocted using no animal matter at all , not even milk , butter or cheese , so cries of : You must eat meat , or , You must have a quart of milk per day , are misleading as far as fats are concerned . Meat and milk are desirable but they are not necessarily on the " must " list , providing the diet is very carefully chosen and planned to meet all the needs . The dairy interests have gone determinedly to bat a great many times with the margarines , and have usually been victorious to the extent of putting a few more cents of unjustified tax on the already burdened margarine package . The contention is that butter is a better food than margarine , which is correct , but the dairy interests go further and say that margarine should be taxed out of existence .  | The dairy organizations are very righteous in their concern about the public health . They will go to any extremes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is very simple ? form a tight organization , essentially a monopoly , legislate competitive materials out of the way and then charge all the traffic will bear . Meanwhile there are probably 40 million people in the United States who can not afford butter and 25 million who can not even afford margarine . For several years it has been recognized that one of the chief nutritional advantages of butter over margarine lay in a higher vitamin A content . Margarine manufacturers should be able to incorporate vitamin A concentrates in their product , as some European manufacturers are doing , and thus make it as good as butter ? at a much smaller cost . However , the situation is not quite so simple . The essentiality of certain fats has been established since those earlier vitamin days and again butter has come out on top . In one experiment nineteen different samples of margarine were tested in comparison with butter in the feeding of rats . With seventeen of the margarines the rats died . With the other two they survived and gained a little weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived and gained about four times as much weight as with the best margarine . This was from the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station , however , and Nebraska would unquestionably like to sell butter . One pair of Americans have some good words to say for margarines . They found that nut margarines containing 10 to 14 per cent of palm oil contained substantial amounts of vitamin A. Problems of nutrition worry the Russians a great deal , for the U. S. S. R. is a long way from being the best-fed nation on earth . Shortages of animal fats have at times been particularly acute . Some of the Russian researchers have been able to say some very favorable things about vegetable fats . Picket and his associates compared the nutritional values  | of butter , soy bean oil and margarine . The subjects as usual , were rats . In the period of growth the butter and soy bean rats ran neck and neck and tail to tail . The margarines lagged considerably behind . To test the staying power of the different foods the rats , after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Soy beans showed the greatest staying power , for the soy beaners lived the longest , butter-feds next and margariners died first . Another score for the great bean of the ancient Chinese . ' Those who consider China as the home only of coolies , bird-nest soup , temple bells and Japanese oppression may be distressed to know that young China is promoting extensive scientific research in modern universities . Those who are engaged in research on China 's nutrition naturally turn to vegetable products , for China during its centuries of overcrowding has had to rely upon vegetables rather than upon animals , which are less efficient food producers . A recent study demonstrated which of the vegetable oils were most valuable in the feeding of rats . The relative score of nutritional efficiency , in descending order , was : soy bean , peanut , linseed , sesame , mustard seed , hemp seed . The soy bean , it seems , always and inevitably wins . There is one factor in the butter-margarine battle that even the boldest theorist would hardly have suspected ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones and teeth . Not only must we get it in our food , we must retain it and absorb it in our bodies ; just having it passing through does n't benefit us in the least . It has been found ( with rats again ) that calcium is retained much better by butter-fed animals than by margarine-fed . This might be due to the vitamin D content of butter , or it might be due to something else . No one is sure yet . The butter-margarine controversy will be with us for some time to come . There will be much politics , some legislative broken heads and no small amount of oratory involved be- fore anyone will listen to the scientific evidence which is being built up . The evidence at present seems to say that a margarine prepared entirely from vegetable fats and oils , selected to give all the essential fatty acids and fortified with vitamin A and D concentrates , can be nutritionally almost as good as butter , but none of them on the market seem to have come up to those specifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , the rather haughty dairy industry is going to do some serious thinking . And this is n't the only potential agricultural storm in the biochemist 's test tube . PROTEINS AND PROTOPLASM Proteins represent the stream of life . They make up the vital part of that essential jelly material of the living cell ? the protoplasm . The beginning of life on this and perhaps a few other fortunate planets must have been associated with the formation of proteins . This word means " to take first place , " for there is no life without proteins . The name was the lucky choice of Mulder , one of the first investigators . Although for two thousand years the physiological scholars of the world had believed , on the authority of Hippocrates , that all foodstuffs contained a single universal aliment necessary to maintain animal life , Monsieur Francois Magendie , in the early eighteen-hundreds , decided that mere authority was not enough and that the subject should be investigated experimentally . He " killed a dog by feeding it with sugar only , in order to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having sugared many dogs to death he regaled others on olive oil , and buttered more and all with the same mortal issue . " As the " non-azotized " substances contained no proteins the dogs had lacked a whole class of food constituents necessary for the maintenance of life . Hippocrates ' idea of one universal aliment was doomed .  | If you would see proteins , look over your own body , or examine the germ of a grain of wheat . Or , if you would have one that is practically pure , look at the white of an egg which is almost all albumen and water . Usually these most essential of life 's materials have the indefinite and glue-like form known as a colloid , though some of them have been separated as pure and definite crystals . Though the detailed structures of the molecules are complex almost beyond comprehension , there are only a few chemical elements which enter into their make-up . Most proteins will be found in the range of chemical composition of : 51 to 55 per cent carbon , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen , 15.5 to 18.7 nitrogen , 0.3 to 2.0 per cent sulphur . Some of them also contain a little phosphorus or iron . Nature makes some tremendous structures out of these few materials . The chemical path by which proteins may be formed is too twisting , uncertain and uninteresting to be followed . Whatever the method of accomplishment , it is a process in which plants are peculiarly adept . They take the sugars and the starches which they have made from the sunshine , water and carbon dioxide of the air , add a pinch of nitrogen , and sometimes sulphur , from the soil , and from these ingredients synthesize the amino acids from which the life-supporting proteins are built . Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins . Animals form the proteins characteristic of their own tissues from these amino acids , but in general can not to any great extent build proteins from simple substances as can the plants . Therefore animals live by sufferance of the plants . There are 21 amino acids that have been definitely identified as existing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our existence . Only some of them have been found to be absolutely essential for the life of the higher animals . An authority on the nutritional aspects of proteins is Dr. W. C. Rose of the University of Illinois . He has gradually enlarged the original list until it  | is now definitely established that at least 9 of the 21 naturally-occurring amino acids absolutely must be in the foodstuffs of animals if they are to live and have good health . There are a few more of the acids that are convenient in the sense that the animal will thrive better if he has them , though they are not absolutely essential . They are interchangeable with other essential ones . It will bear repeating that these amino acids are but the building blocks of the much more complicated proteins which are the building blocks of life . Do not assume , because the amino acids , which are the basic constituents of proteins , are few in number , that there are only a few proteins in nature . If you know something of the possibilities of assortment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will appreciate that the possible assortments and arrangements in a system of 21 amino acids will be very much larger . It has been computed that from 20 amino acids it should be chemically possible to form at least **25;944;TOOLONG different proteins or protein-like compounds . Nature has not tried to dabble in chemistry to the extent of making them all , and fortunately , we do not have to have all of them ; we can get along very well with only a few . Probably several thousand of the possible combinations do exist in nature and certainly several hundred do , for that many have been investigated and identified . Fortunately there are single proteins which contain all of those amino acids that are essential to life , and there are a great many more which contain most of them . Those substances that will maintain life and growth if used as the sole protein food are classed as " complete " proteins . Those most commonly consumed for human food are : casein and lactalbumin of milk ; ovalbumin and ovovitellin of eggs ; glycinin of soy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glutenin and corn glutelin of the cereal grains . These are  | the ones which contain all of the essential acids as well as the " convenient " ones . Lean meat and the vital organs of animals being a mixture of a great many pure proteins are " complete . " There is another group which will maintain life but not normal growth . These contain the essential acids but not all of the " convenient " ones . Some well-proven examples of this class are : gliadin of wheat , hordein of barley and prolamin of rye . Those proteins which will not maintain life are , as might be expected , classed as incomplete . The best known of this group are gelatin and zein of corn . This little display gallery will enable you to draw a few general conclusions about some of the necessary constituents of the diet . In the " complete " class of protein foods animal products predominate . If you wo n't eat meat and do not care for milk or eggs then you could obtain your protein from Brazil nuts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth while . You can also exist and presumably be in good health if you rely on wheat ( warning : use the whole grain products ) . You could even keep on living on corn , rye or barley but you will do much better on wheat . It would be fatal to attempt to live on the incomplete proteins such as gelatin or degerminated corn . Gelatin is an excellent carrier for colors , flavors and sugar in salads or desserts ; it fills the stomach , produces a considerable amount of energy for your use and helps you to do with less of certain other proteins , but one can not live by gelatin alone . An attempt was made in the eighteenth century ? and failed . The social forces which came together in the bloody head of the French Revolution were largely nutritional in character . The mob arose because it was starving . Histories tell of the political intrigue of taxes and lack of representation , of gaudy palaces and peasant 's hovels , but they waste but few words on the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of Dickens ' J Tale of Two Cities , which describe the starving people scooping up the wine from the broken cask which has  | fallen in the gutter , and even chewing the wine-soaked wood , outline the essential background of the Revolution . But the problem of food for the proletariat was acute long before the Revolution . There were immense sufferings and loud grumblings , never quite articulate . An attempt was made to eke out food for the mob with gelatin made of waste animal products . There was enough gelatin available to fill a great many stomachs . The people ate the gelatin but they starved to death just as they had before . Had this material been a complete protein , affairs from 1789 on might possibly have been different . Though the only definite criterion of the sufficiency of a particular protein is its " completeness " as revealed by its ability to sustain life and growth , there are still distinct differences among the proteins which are complete . A strict vegetarian consuming no milk , eggs or meat but having ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of satisfaction . But it has been amply demonstrated in animal and human experiments that he will grow more and be in better health if he will substitute some animal materials , at least milk and eggs , for some of the vegetable proteins . There have been careful and thorough investigations ofd the nutritive possibilities of the all-vegetable diet . There are various combinations of plant materials that will keep a human being alive , after a fashion , but no combination has been found which will provide " optimum " nutrition for the omnivorous animals that human beings are . While strict vegetarianism is possible it is unsatisfactory and more than a little difficult . There is no exact explanation of this except the generalized one that animal proteins have more nearly the same combinations and proportions of the amino acids which we need than do the vegetables . The chemical structure of animals is more nearly like that of our own bodies . None of the food proteins contains exactly the mixture of  | amino acids required by the human body . But the more nearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nearly perfect it is considered to be . The more nearly complete proteins are called " first class . " There is less waste with these first class proteins . In the case of vegetable proteins we have to do a great deal of selecting and chemical rearranging before they are ready for our use . Hence some animal products , while not absolutely essential , are highly desirable . There is nothing , particularly for delicate digestive systems , that can quite take the place of milk . And as far as the infant is concerned there is as yet no material , no matter how carefully compounded , which quite equals mothers ' milk for supplying all the necessary and easily assimilated materials . Flat-breasted women , though charming , are racial liabilities . Goats ' milk sometimes proves to be a better infant food than cows ' milk and it was common knowledge that a century ago in Germany the she-goats made excellent wet-nurses and would trot with admirable readiness to their foster children on hearing their cries . Whether or not Romulus and Remus had complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to bother with such details . Mares ' milk is used among the Arabs much more than cows ' milk and is fully as good a food if not better . In 18th century England , asses ' milk was prized as a remedy for consumptive patients . According to a contemporary periodical , " Asses ' milk was to be had at Richard Stout 's , at the Sign of the Ass , for the shilling and six pence per quart ; the ass to be brought to the buyer 's door . " ( From Post Boy , December 6 , 171 I ) . It is understood that the seller was not liable for the hazard of the milking . If no mothers ' , goats ' or asses ' milk is to be had , cows ' milk modified with easily digestible sugars and water is a possible substitute . The modern infant is introduced to the proteins of egg yolk within a few weeks , then as it becomes more and more accomplished in the ways of the world it is  | allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long before the parents have ceased celebrating the monthly birthdays it can handle a little meat without serious difficulty . The pioneer mother speeded this stage by pre-chewing the meat for the child . This practice was continued until the victim had at least four teeth . The height of accomplishment is reached when the infant alimentary canal can carry through on the digestion of some of the vegetable proteins . This timetable of infant feeding is an index to the relative degree of difficulty encountered in handling the different proteins found in nature . Starting the modern child on its digestive career is a trying and delicate task . In primitive days before there was all this foolishness of nutrition , how did the babies survive ? They did n't . Most of them died . When grandfather objects to all this clap-trap of infant care he must remember that the babies ' chance of surviving the first year has been increased several fold since he went through the mill and only because people nowadays know a bit more about what they are trying to do . We do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast-fed , either because of the inability or the unwillingness of the mother . The modern substitutes for the human mammary secretions are passable but by no means perfect . As in prehistoric times , the only thing that keeps the babies of present primitive peoples alive is mother 's milk . The infant mortality among African tribes today is terrific , largely because of filth and epidemics , partly because of food . It would be much worse if the children were not nursed for at least the first two years of existence . The black woman lapses into a mere udder existence and she will frequently continue nursing one baby even after the next one comes . The pictures of the perky , tight breasts of the brown or black girls which give mixed audiences slight , delightful shocks are good photographic material , but the subjects are most certainly virgins , not  | mothers . Constant nursing quickly deforms the full breast of the mother and the badge of femininity becomes a limp and sagging sac . Among some of the now extinct Tasmanians the milk-dispensing activities so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the mother , when she worked , threw her breasts over her shoulders , where they stayed while she hoed the ground to raise vegetables for the older children . Race survival by natural means does things to feminine beauty . If the argument ? that animal proteins are desirable in proportion to their chemical similarity to the eating organism ? were carried to its logical conclusion , you can readily see that the answer would be cannibalism . It is a fact which even the most squeamish nutritionist must admit . For easy assimilation and utilization of flesh materials there is nothing which can quite equal human meat . It is particularly to be recommended for delicate stomachs . When we abandoned cannibalism our social gain far outweighed our nutritional loss , but the dietetic advantage still stands . It must be remembered that the objections are entirely of sociological and psychological origin . There is ample testimony to the effect that for taste , texture and palatability human flesh can hardly be equaled . Richard Coeur de Lion crusaded amongst the Saracens for the good of Christendom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minor and overcome with a longing for good English food , he ordered that there should be wild boar for his supper . The cook obliged with some well-seasoned meat that Richard swore was the best boar ever eaten . Next morning after a long sleep he praised the cook and demanded , " Now this time bring me that boar 's head . " The cook wot full well that it was the boar 's head or his own , but instead of falling on his sword he stepped forward and confessed that the quest for wild boar on the previous day had failed ; there appeared to be no such animal in the Holy  | Land . As a last resort he had gone to the prisoners ' pen , killed the finest Saracen there and served slices of him to the great Richard . Having made full confession he was resigned to his own execution . But the Lion-hearted blustered mightily in hearty approval , swearing that it was still the finest meat ever eaten and that now he knew how his soldiers could live off the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . History does not record that the soldiers shared the King 's enthusiasm or that they even followed his orders , but it was a good Christian idea just the same . PROPER PROPORTIONING OF THE BIG THREE According to the Hay diet system the carbohydrates , fats and proteins should be kept as segregated as the sexes , but most of us prefer to take these three ingredients just as they come , no matter how shamefully they may be intertwined . Fortunately , they are so well intermixed that the theoretical Hay feeding system is impossible to achieve . Each of us has a taster which is supposed to call a halt on our appetite when we get too much of anything . The commonest contention of the amateur dietitian of the debunking school is that appetite is a completely adequate guide for proper selection ; of which , refutation later . Indisputably it is true that our very adaptable laboratory-on-legs is able to get acceptable results with a widely divergent range of raw materials . Happy individuals are found living on the all-meat meals ( high protein ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( high carbohydrate ) of the Southern Negro . But this by no means signifies that any Combination of foodstuffs is just as good as any other . The proper proportioning theme has been battled out many times both academically and clinically . The result has inevitably been a draw , for no one can prove anything with absolute certainty . Races left to themselves invariably eat almost everything available and the analysis of the contents of the intestinal  | tract tends to represent a fair cross-section of the edible fauna and flora of the region . Groups in different parts of the world show tremendous variations in the make-up of the average meal . The following table is a summation of a number of surveys of the amount and composition of the actual diet of the average individual in various groups . It can be seen from the table that human beings do exist on widely varying menus . But they do not live equally well . The high-carbohydrate peoples , such as the African Kikuyu , are invariably lethargic , lacking in stamina and subject to disease . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low carbohydrates . They generally live happy and healthful lives but their life span is short . They are old at forty and decrepit at fifty . They seldom survive to sixty years . It is probable that the optimum proportioning of the Big Three lies somewhere between the extremes . All experimental and clinical investigations point to that conclusion . However ineffective the League of Nations may be in dabbling with international politics , it is effective as a medium for gathering information for international well-being .  | It has a Health Organization which has collected available information on the best proportions of carbohydrates , fats and proteins for the average man . The following table summarizes their recommendations along with those of several other authorities . That is n't perfect agreement but for experts it is n't bad .  | MINERALS EVERY thread of nutritional discussion leads back to the spool of evolution . Life was born in the sea as a complicated series of chemical reactions taking place in a water solution of various mineral compounds . It has continued in that pattern ever since it began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry land they surrounded themselves with a hard coating , put a bit of the sea water inside to serve as a medium for the continuance of life 's chemistry , and formed a closed circulatory system . That bit of sea water is our blood and its average mineral content has changed but very little from that of the ocean in the far distant period when life evolved into something that could exist on dry land . Animals ventured upon the terrestrial state in Cambrian times , a quarter to half a billion years ago . The concentration of salt in the sea water today is greater than it was when the ancestors of the land vertebrates left it , because surface salt from the land has continually been washed into it by the rivers . The common salt ( sodium chloride ) in our blood amounts to about three-tenths of a r cent . The Cambrian sea must have had the same composition . The amount of salt in our blood has remained static while the sea continued to collect salt all these millions of cars until the concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than the blood . The minerals which we have in our system have been important links in our vital processes for so long that we dare not try to dispense with them now . Iron we must have  |p8o  in our blood to get oxygen from the air , and we must have minute traces of copper or the iron can not be assimilated . Calcium and phosphorus must be at hand to make our bones and teeth , as well as to perform various other functions . If we had no iodine we should all be mere vegetating imbeciles . If you were to take an average group of men , grind them up to small bits and analyze them you should find the following proportions of chemical elements : All the elements below the fourth in the list may be classed as mineral materials . They are small in quantity but large in importance . If you were an analyst extraordinary and followed every chemical suggestion in your sample , you would find detectable quantities of at least seven other mineral elements : arsenic , boron , bromine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of fluorine , boron , and aluminum every one of these twenty-five elements seem to be on the " must " list . Human life without most of them is impossible . No definite function has yet been fixed for a few of them , such  | as tin , but they are always present in the human body and so are probably necessary , if not for life itself , at least for good health . It does n't take much imagination to see that the chemical make-up of our foods must represent a good cross-section of the materials of the earth . Not only must all of these elements be present in our food , but they must occur in a form which can be assimilated by the body . If your diet is lacking in iron , you can not make up the deficiency by eating iron ore , for such a material is not assimilable . You must have copper but you can not get it by sprinkling fine grains of copper-bearing rock on your salad . The body is not only very exacting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays down stringent rules regarding the form in which the material must be presented . For the most part these mineral materials are only the minor constituents of plant and animal life and , unfortunately for our good health , they occur most frequently in what we ordinarily consider , in this age of refinement , the waste products of food . The outer layers and germ of the rains , the peelings of the tubers and fruits , the coarser , afy , unbleached parts of vegetables , the vital organs and he blood of animals are materials that members of the civiized world apparently want to discard as being too plebeian or food . But these are the materials that contain the indisnsable minerals and often the equally indispensable vitains . It is the giblets and not the white meat that should the really prized part of the chicken . By stripping cereals all their outer coats and refining sugar until it is whiter an the whitest snow , we have made a good start on the ad to the ruination of human health , for fine milling removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foodstuffs has probably been as successful in promoting American ill-health in the past two generations as most virulent disease germs . Actually , over-fastidiousness  | and disease have been guilty of collusion , for a mineral deficiency is often the wedge that pries open the door for the entrance of infection ? of which more later . The beneficial aspects of nutritional advances have , in a great many quarters , been nearly neutralized by the absurd public demand for over-refined foods . This is n't intended as an argument for the ardent school of Back-to-Nature . Nature will bear a great deal of improving , but her demands , which have been in force now for some millions of generations , must not be ignored . Nutrition is one of the more difficult fields because of its complexity , and only recently have experimenters really got a view of the breadth of the field and realized how seriously we have been ignoring nature 's requirements . CALCIUM Calcium is the most permanent thing in animal life . The chalk cliffs of Dover , so dear to the English heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells and urchin spines which dropped to the ocean bed a hundred million years ago . Large animal bones and teeth have remained in protected places almost intact for millions of years , and the only evidence we have of man 's first million years is in the calcium-bearing bones and teeth which he has left . These bits of us which may survive for posterity amount to but little more than a box of chalk , but to maintain this meager storehouse the average adult must assimilate about 0.45 gram ( o.oi6 ounce ) of the element calcium per day , for the bones and teeth are continuously breaking down and exchanging new molecules for old , and calcium is being continuously excreted . All of our calcium is completely replaced about every six years , and the only way to maintain the balance in the body is to take in a sufficient quantity in the food . If there is insufficient intake the body tries to make adjustment , but it is never completely successful . It goes on excreting calcium , taking it from the bones and  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attempted adjustment evidences itself in serious ill-health of various sorts , and if the shortage is really severe , premature death is almost certain . The calcium requirement for the growing young is fully twice as great as that of the average adult . The need is particularly great in the human species , for we are born distinctly calcium-poor and must make up the prenatal deficiency in the first years of life . If this were not so there would be no babies , at least not very many . As man came up in the world , he assumed the vertical position and contracted the volume of the pelvic region . As he made evolutionary advances , he became brainier and this called for a larger head . Smaller pelvis plus larger head means difficulties at birth and the men of past generations have made the situation even more difficult by displaying sexual preferences for thin-waisted women . Thus , by natural and artificial selection we have come to the point where it would be mechanically almost impossible to be born were it not for the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft and pliable . The semi-plastic state of the infant head is all that stands between us and race extinction , unless cesarean births should be universal . This calcium deficiency of the human infant has had an effect upon the whole history of the human race . A colt will stand and suck almost as soon as its mother is on its feet , puppies crawl within an hour of birth , a calf is vigorous and obstreperous by the time it is a day old , but the human offspring has to wait six or seven months before its bone structure permits it to sit upright and it can not walk for a year . That is because its skeleton is more cartilage than calcium phosphate , while all the other animals spring almost fully calcified from the mother 's womb . This infant helplessness which , be it remembered , is an indirect result of the upright position and increased brain size , is the most im- portant fact in human sociology , for it is around this that family life and the most powerful human emotions are built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which generates prolonged parental affection and all of the social phenomena connected therewith . If our children were fully equipped and romping when they were a week old , not only our family lives but all of world history would be vastly different , and probably even worse than it is . This calcium deficiency is not primarily based on shortcomings of the mother 's diet ? it is merely the desperate adaptation of experimental nature . When the human race was evolved there were many bad mistakes and makeshift repairs . We are merely churlish bits of patchwork . No matter what the calcium intake of the pregnant woman may be , selective hereditary traits governing the nutritional pattern have seen to it that the fetus remains calcium-poor . Despite this provision the mother 's own reservoir of calcium is usually depleted . Decaying teeth and weakened bones are one of the most common results of pregnancy . The average woman does not get enough milk , egg-yolk and other highcalcium items to satisfy the demands of herself and her fetus . If the rations are slightly deficient , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth suffer ( ask any dentist ) , but if there is any great shortage the prenatal development of the infant is seriously hampered and it comes into the world doomed to a period of ill-health . The incidence of " sickly " children can be correlated with the quality of diet of the pregnant woman , and hospital records reveal that women classified as undernourished during pregnancy show greatly increased proportions of still- and premature births , and of deaths of babies within ten days after birth . Pregnancy is a partnership and there is no way in which the mother can escape her responsibility . Some women try to avoid delivery-suffering by following a mineral-poor diet during pregnancy . The reasoning seems  | to be that if no minerals are supplied there will be no bones ; the fetus will be but a mass of putty and delivery will be easy . But that is a false and dangerous line of attact . It helps neither mother nor baby and injures both . In discussing food requirements it is first necessary to define " requirements . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different thing to be in excellent health . The figure of 0.45 of a gram of calcium per day for the average adult represents the quantity required to keep the body in repair . It has been found by animal experiments and amply checked by human studies , that the state of health of the individual steadily improves if the mineral element quotas are over-subscribed by at least 50 per cent . This should be regarded as the minimum for human health . Using this criterion , the average adult needs at least o.68 gram of calcium per day and a large proportion of average diets do not furnish this much . Appreciable improvement in health is found if the calcium intake is carried up to twice this amount . Calcium deficiency may explain a great deal of the " poor to middlin " ' health and might conceivably be related to some of the lack of vitality displayed by the people you know who have been dead on the job for twenty years and have never realized it . One corollary of being born calcium-poor is that growing children must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have greater requirements than adults . From-the moment that a baby takes its mother 's breast , or the sterilized rubber nipple , it is ravenously sucking calcium . For good health , even though the body is small , it demands a gram a ( lay . Whether boy or girl , it needs this much until the middle teens . In later adolescence the requirement drops to o , i8 gram per day , and then in middle life to o.68 gram . The active woman , particularly if she is anticipating pregnancy , has a higher requirement than man . To be on the ' de of safety she should have at least o.88 gram per day .  | During pregnancy , the requirement goes still higher . The average fetus depletes the mother 's calcium storehouse by about i gram per day . If she values her teeth she will remember that extra load . All these data of grams mean but little unless they can be translated into terms of daily food supply . The average man with a daily requirement of o.68 gram of calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakers ' bread ( the kind that 's made with water ) in order to get it if he ate no other calcium-bearing foods . Two pounds of whole wheat bread or 1.1 pounds of Boston brown bread will furnish the same amount . If you would rather exist on a bit of fish and chips with a bit of tea in the afternoon , you can pass muster as far as calcium is concerned if you take in 7 pounds of fresh herring or io pounds of potatoes . Neither water nor sugar contains any of the bone-builder , so the cup of tea is no help . This is by way of explaining the Englishman 's poor teeth , but it is not meant to be an excuse . Almonds , unrefined cane molasses , and mustard greens lead the field in calcium content ? less than a pound per day of either or all would fill your calcium needs , but one could hardly enjoy life on that . It would be much simpler and pleasanter to drink 11 pints of milk ( whole or skimmed ) per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied . Children need a quart a day . No one has yet found a better way of meeting nature 's calciferous demands , to the great profit of the dairy industry . Nature may be improved on later and the dairymen will suffer but they are well entrenched for some time to come . The American way of living may be the best there is ? so the Republicans believe . It does supply quite a few Fords , Chevrolets , refrigerators and other gadgets , but it does n't supply enough calcium , and there are those who would rank calcium above gadgets in importance . The first requisite to human health is to dine well , not sumptuously but intelli- gently . Surveys of the food consumed by average income groups show that the average American is skirting dangerously close to the requirement of o.68 gram per day . In any group there are always a great many who are below the standard for good health . That partially explains why dentistry is a good business . In the lower income groups where the next meal is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Members of the lower income groups , on the average , have more children than others , hence their requirements for optimum nutrition are higher than average . Their actual intake is below the average . The deficiency makes itself evident in the health records . It is a vicious circle . The next time distributors dump excess milk production into rivers they should be made to study the problem of national calcium deficiency . In the past , calcium deficiencies were also prevalent in the ranks of the effete , where a delicate stomach was a mark of superiority and only the most refined foods were allowed admission . Education , however , is having an effect there , strange as it may seem . Whenever the mineral requirements are considered it must be borne in mind that all of the materials taken in are not always assimilated by the human body . They are only partly available . There is a very wide variation in the degree of assimilability between individuals . That is one reason why the rations should supply a quantity well above the minimum requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning ; the two together are required to make our bones and teeth . We must have our phosphorus and plenty of it , twice as much as calcium ( about 1.4 grams per day ) for we turn over our body 's total supply in less than three years . The greater need comes from the fact that phosphorus is required by  | some of the body proteins , phospholipins and phosphatases . Fortunately most foods are more plentiful in phosphorus than in calcium , the notable exception being milk . Meat and egg-yolk are high in phosphorus ; 9 to Io ounces of egg-yolk or 13 ounces of round steak would be sufficient for the daily supply . If you would n't care for 7 ounces of cocoa powder per day you could satisfy your phosphorus needs with a little less than 7 ounces of American cheese or a little more than that of dried navy beans . Infant feedings should be supplemented with egg-yolks for there are about equal amounts of calcium and phosphorus in milk and the body demands about twice as much of the latter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally true that if the calcium requirement is met on a mixed diet the phosphorus quota has been filled as well . That makes one less thing to worry about . IRON Iron can not be passed by as lightly as phosphorus , even though the body contains only enough to make a ten-penny nail . If we had no iron we should have no blood . There is a striking similarity in the energy-promoting or absorbing mechanism in all branches of life . Higher animals all have blood containing iron-bearing hemoglobin , to act as an oxygen carrier . Instead of hemoglobin some of the lower sea animals have hemocyanin , which is almost the same chemical composition except that copper has been substituted for the iron . The green chlorophyll of plants , which promotes the reactions of photosynthesis which make all life possible , has a chemical composition quite similar to our own hemoglobin , but magnesium has been substituted for iron in the molecule . There seems to be a definite thread of interrelation . The idea of the necessity of iron for the human system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The evil- tasting plagues usually classed as tonics often depended on iron compounds for their efficacy or at least their advertising value . Sure-fire cure for boils usually contained enough iron to be put on the label . Perhaps it helped to chase the boils away ? at least it did no harm . The iron idea still pervades part of the patent medicine field . The earlier cure-alls have been put in more attractive containers and more tasty tablets at an increased price , but the idea of the effectiveness of iron in curing maladies is still about the same . Though the public is well-grounded in the iron idea , their thinking in this connection has been like that of the medics : they consider only what one should do when one is ill , not what one should do to prevent illness . Iron as a medicine is wonderful ; iron as a food is bunk ? this represented thegeneral attitude until the 1920 's . Meatless days , individual vegetable gardens and whole wheat campaigns during the World War roused the food consciousness of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that human diet might , after all , be improved . It became public knowledge that the average diet is deficient in iron . It was a new field , all ploughed and fertilized for the advertising man . Sun Maid Raisins did a rushing box office business through the slogan " Have You Had Your Iron Today ? " The implication was that a one-ounce box for a nickel would supply the 0.012 of a gram of assimilable iron which the average man requires per day . As a matter of fact it would take almost twenty such boxes . Iron is stored in egg yolks for the use of the prospective chick , but it would take about ten eggs daily to supply this element for a man . If one insisted on eating white bread and nothing else he would certainly be anemic because of insufficient iron unless he ate at least three and one half pounds daily . One and one quarter pounds of graham bread would do as well . The beef-eater can get his iron each day from one and a quarter pounds of lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat one third  | pound of liver , or half a pound of mutton or turkey , or , if you can get it , about two ounces of blood might suffice , though there is some evidence that the iron from blood is not easily assimilated . We should try to conserve all the blood when preparing meats . Most savage peoples , and some civilized ones , either drink the blood or use it in cooking . That 's sound nutrition . The much heralded and often despised spinach is generous with its iron , but it would take a full pound of the pure material ( no sand ) to keep a man in iron for a day . It is n't much better than dandelion greens and only about half as good as turnip or mustard greens . Alfalfa is the best vegetable of all for supplying iron . Milk is what nature devised for the perfect food , but something called her away before the job was finished and she left iron out . It would take i i pints a day of the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . It would require about 11 pints of human milk to supply all the iron a baby uses in one day . Nature tried to whitewash this oversight by storing up a reserve iron supply in the fetus . The newborn of all mammals have enough reserve iron for the first period of growth ? about two months for the human being . Babies who receive nothing but milk for a period longer than a few months inevitably develop an anemia and are usually susceptible to disease and infections . The old-timers who think it is unnatural to start young babies on egg-yolk , liver pulp , or spinach within a few weeks of birth do n't know their nature . Young mammals of all kinds begin supplementary feedings on their own very early in life . Human infants being helpless have to receive a bit of judicious aid in their early nutrition and even the adults could profit by a little advice and direction . The iron requirement of o.o12 gram per day represents the usual 50 per cent factor of safety over the bare necessity . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of safety for iron should really be higher than 5o per cent . The 0.012 gram of assimilable iron supposedly required per day is hardly more than a touch of dust on a table top and so should be easy to obtain . Dietary surveys , however , show that we Americans , particularly the females and infants , are dangerously flirting with the dietary anemia that is caused by insufficient iron . In a careful dietary study , over a period of a year , of four children 's institutions near New York City , with a total of over 800 children , Rose found that iron was the greatest mineral deficiency in two of the institutions . The deficiency amounted to well over 20 per cent in one institution and she attributed it to low proportion of fruits , vegetables , whole wheat bread and whole cereals . The actual deficiency in another institution was 29 per cent . It was found that the diet of the fisherfolk in Labrador had adequate iron as long as they used meat and crude molasses , but when white sugar was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low . Another study , which divided the U. S. population into groups , found that only 58 per cent of workingmen 's families and only 28 per cent of farm families received adequate iron . Even though the average intake found by Sherman in 15o typical American diets was 0.017 gram per day the minimum intake was found to be o.008o gram , which is dangerously under the line . Moreover the analyses were probably made on raw food stuffs , not on what was put into t he mouth . There are often large losses of iron if ordinary preparation methods are used . This might cut down the actual intake of iron by half or more . Any conclusion that we are not , after all , doing so badly with our iron intake is belied by the relatively large proportion of anemic appearing individuals that even the amateur can pick out of almost any of those crowds which are cross-sections of America .  | The books are by no means closed on the iron question , for the findings of different investigators show as much disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elimination will vary as much as three-fold from one investigator to another . It seems that different individuals do vary widely in their requirements . Also , some iron compounds are more easily assimilated than others . Natural foods also vary . Then there are analytical difficulties , for accurate determinations of these very small concentrations of iron in foods require great precision , care and skill . The knowledge of iron assimilation seemed to be in an almost satisfactory state when some rat-feeding experiments at the University of Wisconsin went wrong . The rats were anemic . Iron salts were added to a diet thought to be otherwise adequate . Still there was severe anemia . Before the work was finished , it was found that there must also be a trace of copper in the menu before iron can be utilized in the making of hemoglobin . The body demands its daily whiff of iron but it will accept it only on its own rigid terms . The complexity and variability of the iron picture would lead one to believe that the situation might bear closer investigation than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true even if the published analyses were always correct , but there are great variations in the mineral content of plant foods , depending on the composition of the soil on which they are grown . Vegetables deficient in iron mean anemic human beings . The index of anemia is the hemoglobin content of the blood . Three per cent of the blood cells are destroyed daily . If there is not adequate iron available to replace them , their number becomes subnormal , sometimes with very unpleasant and uncomfortable consequences . Every large group that has been studied by competent investigators has been found to contain at least a substantial and sometimes a discouraging proportion of anemics . The indi- viduals below par have invariably been benefited by addition of high iron foods or soluble iron compounds to the diet . A survey of 3,445 Florida school children showed that over 30 per cent were anemic . Still another examination of 6,015 pre-school children in Gary , Indiana , showed that about 8 per cent were anemic . One adequate survey of the diet of a fair sample of rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low in iron . The Englishmen seem to have done a more thorough job in making these surveys than we have . It happens that their dietary is deficient in a number of items , so they need to be concerned . Because of the indisputable importance of her iron studies , Dr. Helen Mackay , physician to the Queen 's Hospital for Children , London , has broken one of the toughest of British traditions , one of four hundred years ' standing ? not the oldest British tradition by a goodly number of centuries but still no mere upstart . She was the first woman to be elected to fellowship in the Royal College of Physicians . That is ample proof that her findings created a little stir . Dr. Mackay 's principal study was on a group of i , 000 London babies . Even a woman must shrink at hearing , studying , and administering to a thousand of them , but there are those born for heroism . She found that 42 per cent of the breast fed and 70 per cent of the artificially fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of milk and cereal ( even with the best advertised cereal ) was not adequate . In an attempt to eradicate anemia , she administered iron-ammonium citrate in small quantities to the diet of part of the group . They all responded with an increased hemoglobin . They gained weight faster than the controls who received no iron therapy , and the incidence of colds , bronchitis , miscellaneous infections of all kinds was reduced by one-half . These data are sufficiently obvious to call for no interpreter .  | This infant anemia is in part the visitation of the mother 's sins upon the child . She may be a very good mother and her intentions the best in the world but , despite this , iron deficiency in pregnancy will cause anemia in her offspring . The prevalence of anemia among women , especially during pregnancy , is probably a factor in their lowered resistance to infection . Most moderns have become used to the idea of fortifying the infant 's diet with strange substances and will admit that the offspring is better for it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefited in any way means running into a storm . Many investigators , however , are recommending iron therapy for mothers as well as for infants . Aberdeen ranks reasonably well in the health records , but if a fair sample of the population is significant , 16 per cent of the adolescent women and 45 per cent of the adult women are definitely anemic , and 15 per cent are severe cases which administration of iron will cure rapidly . It is hard to escape the conclusion that the present residents of the world would be materially benefited if just a bit more of the commonest metal in the world were made available to their stomachs and intestinal walls . Pig iron at a blast furnace costs about one cent per pound . If one bought eggs only for their nutritionally available iron he would pay about eight thousand dollars for each pound of such iron . We ca n't digest pig iron , but since we need the iron there should be some way of closing this price gap . It 's an opportunity for food manufacturers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iodine is all that stands between you and imbecility . It is the principal constituent of thyroxin ( distorted from the Greek , meaning " I rouse to activity " ) which is the watchdog of metabolism . Without thyroxin we should be as brainless and inactive as  | vegetables and far less beautiful , and it takes iodine to make thyroxin . If the soil contains enough iodine there is an ample amount in the food . In places where the soil is deficient in iodine the food and water are also deficient , and the inhabitants have goiter . In such places the swollen neck , caused by the over-working and enlarged thyroid gland , is a matter of common occurrence . South Carolina , being a seacoast state , happens to be rich in iodine and very low in simple goiter . Vigorous advertising almost established it as the Iodine State , but that remained an empty symbol to the bulk of the people . The Ohio Valley and the regions around the Great Lakes extending west as far as the Rockies were formed from sedimentary beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necks of Ohio Valley and Great Lakes girls , especially the young ones , used to be continuous exhibits of simple goiter . The ancient Greeks knew that seaweeds were effective in preventing goiter , but that idea seemed to go into discard with other folklore ? to be rediscovered in the first half of the nineteenth century . By 1852 , one M. Chatin was sure that iodine deficiency was responsible for goiter and proposed iodized salt . But not until the twentieth century after iodine had been found in the thyroid did that idea really take root . In 1916 , Drs . David Marine and O. P. Kimball experimented on 2,000 school children in Akron , Ohio , many of whom had goiters as big as tires . For two months out of the year the children were given minute doses of sodium iodide . Goiter practically disappeared among those treated , while there were 50o cases of goiter in an equal number of untreated . The work was extended to Cleveland , where iodine molecules demonstrated their capabilities equally well . The mass effects were a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Mothers who received sufficient iodine bore children who seldom had adenoids . Common table salt soon became iodized . The common  | practice of manufacturers is to put in one part of sodium iodide per 5,000 parts of salt . That is sufficient for the average individual if he 's the normal salt user . There is but little excuse for simple goiter any more , and the incidence is decreasing almost miraculously . Iodized salt is one of the first steps toward a rational , properly adjusted , semi-synthetic diet . Adequate iodine ? less goiter , less adenoids , greater alertness . This realization has been one of the striking results of the coalition of chemistry and medicine . THE MINOR MINERALS The American diet may be and frequently is deficient in calcium , iron , copper and iodine . Phosphorus usually takes care of itself . The other mineral elements which arrange themselves in ever more minute proportions as one progresses down the list ( see page 8o ) are usually , and fortunately , cared for in the normal diet . The functions of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of those functions are still unknown or uncertain . The results of occasional deficiencies in these materials are medical and not nutritional matters , for almost nothing is known about the specific effects . As the years advance and knowledge piles up , some unexpected connections involving these trace elements may be discovered to explain some of our personal mis-performances . The necessity of having copper for iron assimilation was unknown until a few years ago . Perhaps more subtle interrelationships are to be discovered among the minor constituents . But until definite requirements and functions are fixed , it seems best not to worry about them , for if the supply of the principal minerals is adequate these others seem to take care of themselves . How MAN GETS His MINERALS Those persons who govern their lives in accordance with the theory that what you do n't know wo n't hurt you , like  | to throw cold water on all presentations of nutritional knowledge , branding them as pure bunk . Obviously it is a case of " the Lord will provide " or the race would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum demands which modern nutrition is laying down greatly exceed the practice of the past , hence the researchers must be wrong ; if they were n't no one would have survived . There are several flaws in those arguments . Races which are healthy and vigorous do meet the minimum nutritional requirements , even though they have n't the slightest idea what they may be . The nutritionists of the last couple of decades have pronounced adequate many a primitive diet , which the older nutritionists would have said was absolutely incompatible with good health . The old-timer who pooh-poohs nutrition as a science must remember that it is one thing to be alive and a much larger thing to be in excellent health . Obstinate nature has done many things to make our existence unhappy but it does give us every opportunity to survive . One can be a walking exhibition case of dietary deficiencies and still survive , at least for a while . A man can live with half the normal amount of iodine but he does n't live well , he might even wish he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minimum iron , but he struggles with chronic anemia , decreased vitality and the imminence of fatal infections from day to day and does not lead a happy life . No one is able to state the exact relation between diet and disease , but one can always hazard it guess . It would not be tampering with the truth to any great extent to suggest seriously that fully half of the illnesses and physical maladjustments of even so enlightened it race as the Americans are directly or indirectly traceable to preventable dietary deficiencies . This includes everyt Ding from constipation to tuberculosis . To say , as many are prone to do , that what a man eats is nobody 's business but his own and is of little consequence to him as long as he likes  | it , is simply not true , no matter how eminent the expositor of such a theory may be . Western civilization has done very poorly in feeding itself in the intermediate stages of conquering its environment . In periods of ample production we have been copiously but never well fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that involving the acquisition of minerals , particularly calcium . False niceties of diet have been largely responsible for this neglect . One of the curses of civilization is reputed to have had a rather unique beginning . An English lord who was planning a party called in his miller and discussed the problem of obtaining bread that was not dark grayish in color . The miller worked out a new way of preparing flour , separating the outside of the wheat from the inside , and produced the first white flour . The white bread made from his flour was the sensation of the party . Most people still scorn breads with a tinge of color , and demand the most anemic-appearing mass that millers can produce . The mineral content of white flour is only about one third that of the whole grain . They also demand polished rice and by throwing away the hulls lose half the phosphorus and all of the highly important vitamin B ( more of that later ) . American farmers used to ? and some still do ? scorn milk as mere hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They feed two-thirds of the most valuable minerals and vitamins to the hogs while their own children develop rickets , anemia and dental caries . After cooking schools such as Mrs. Rorer 's became scientifically-minded , they took up missionary duties in the interest of the American stomach . They expostulated at great length with farmers ' wives for throwing away thick potato skins ? " Throwing the best part of the potatoes to the hogs . " This inevitably brought loud guffaws from farmers ' wives ? a city woman thinking that anything but a hog could eat potato skins !  | We demand only the best cuts of meat ( porterhouse steak and breast of chicken ) and eat only a part of that . We look askance at bone-gnawing and our stomachs rebel at blooddrinking , but it is our loss ? we never get the nutritionally valuable part of the animal . For it is the less attractive parts of the animals that contain most of the minerals and vitamins . Primitive women did n't do much for their children , but they did give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . We ca n't blame a modern woman for rebelling at the practice , but nevertheless no completely satisfactory substitute has been found . Most of the undesirable changes that have occurred in nutritional practice in the past century or so may be charged against the desire for refinement and sophistication . We are almost too good for this world and have been refining ourselves out of existence . Fortunately , the newer knowledge of nutrition is getting at the root of the matter and is pointing the way to save our refinement and to improve our health as well . These statements are not intended to insinuate that all is well , nutritionally speaking , with primitive or backward people or even with animals , for there are often serious defects in their food supply . But through centuries of trial and error and with no interference from dietary niceties , they have managed to squeeze the last bits of nutritional benefit from the materials at hand . Many people have assumed that the laboratory findings of the nutritionists may be fine in theory but have nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and have pointed to the paucity of the Oriental diet with its surviving millions as proof . Others have been slightly more generous and have said that Chinese dietary requirements must be different from those of the American or the European ? he is a different kind of animal . Expert investigations have blasted both of these suppositions . The Chinese and every other race that has been investigated have approxi- mately the same mineral requirements that we have . The average Chinese is definitely poor in calcium and is in poorer health than the average Occidental , but his ability to survive at all under the conditions is remarkable . He has only survived by the process of utilizing all of everything that is , in the most liberal interpretation of the word , edible . Thus he gets his minerals . The average Chinese does not have milk to supply his calcium but he does eat large amounts of leafy vegetables which are second-best sources of the bone-builders . The sprouts which he includes in his diet are especially high in minerals and vitamins . The heman American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fodder , but the tougher Chinese bandit welcomes milk ; lacking that he fills his void with quantities of the insipid leafy vegetables . Chinese dishes , even in the emasculated American form , are well filled with the leafy vegetables and sprouted grains that spell the difference between existence and death for the Oriental . Fortunately for him , the Chinaman has also taken up with the soy bean . As human food it is scorned in America , though some condescend to use it for cattle , but in China it is the little honorable plant and has been for thousands of years . Archaeological remains show that its wild predecessor was in use at least 25,000 years ago . Written records of its use go back at least 5,000 years . Emperor Shen-Nung in 2838 B. C. listed 300 ways in which soy products were good for human ailments . The honorable little plant has done well . For a plant , it supplies unusually complete proteins , and is a fairly good substitute for milk . It is high in calcium and phosphorus . Americans meet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garnish for chow mein . Another source of calcium which we overlook is bones . When the Chinese do have a chicken to eat they really eat it . A favorite method of preparing a young fowl is to beat it to a pulp , bones , blood , gizzard , intestines and all ? a few  | feathers more or less do not really matter . It is not unreasonable to suppose , however , that the gall bladder is removed before pulping . Larger animals escape pulping but their bones are used just the same . A favorite dish is " sweet-sour spareribs " made by breaking the rib bones in relatively small pieces and cooking them in sweetened vinegar , which removes some of the minerals from the bones . One small serving of this will fulfill the day 's calcium requirement for the average man . American spareribs and sauerkraut would be even more valuable if we would eat the bones instead of throwing them to the clogs . The Chinese consider it quite satisfactory for those who ( line with the family to suck and chew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chinese is to supply the lactating mother with the better things of life by providing her with special preparations of the bones of pigs ' feet cooked and preserved in vinegar . This was also common food for the American corn-belt home until this generation began to think it too plebeian . The Chinese idea of eating the whole animal is partially the result of modern necessity , but it dates from an earlier time . In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Liao aboriginals were very fond of " Honey Chi . " This consisted of a mouse fetus , just removed from the mother 's womb and soaked in honey . If properly served it could still move about in the dish . When held in chopsticks and chewed it made a " chi , chi " sound , hence the name . The listing of Chinese practices is not intended to turn Western stomachs , but only to indicate that the Oriental has learned to make the most of his food resources ? he had to . If some of the foods seem unpalatable , remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain , to a total stranger to such things , just how one can bear to eat a raw oyster .  | To return to the subject of calcium without milk , nearly all primitive people make much of eating the bones , as many of them as they can manipulate . Every living-site of primitive peoples is surrounded by bones split for their marrow . The softer parts apparently were always chewed . The modern primitive peoples also use many more green leafy foods than we are willing to do . Some leaves which are high in calcium are too coarse and unpalatable even for a primitive , so pregnant and nursing African tribeswomen sometimes augment their food by eating the ashes of such leaves after they have been burned . Thus do they keep even with calcium demands . Many primitive peoples have seasoned their food with ashes , and thus increased the mineral intake . The Iroquois used corn-cob ashes for seasoning their food . Of course , they have n't the slightest conception of calcium or the fact that it is a necessary constituent of bones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine ? a tonic perhaps ? for mothers with child . Thousands of years of trial and error amongst the dirt-eaters has shown the virtue of this procedure . It is folklore that has value just as some of the traditions of the old-time herbalist had some medicinal value . This struggle for calcium among hard-pressed people has been just as severe as the struggle for salt among the ruminating animals and persists for the same reason ; it is a biological necessity . Those would-be investigators who claim that the dietaries of the people of other times and places required less calcium than modern research has found necessary by laboratory experimentation have simply overlooked or ignored many sources of supply of this necessary element . Individuals of course live for long periods while suffering calcium deficiencies , and if the lack is not too great , they may survive . Hence modern man continually thwarts calcium requirements , and if no healthy brute comes along to  | crack his weakened bones and if the dentist patches his teeth or sells him false ones , he can survive and propagate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children as rickets , but true rickets seldom develop after two years of age . If calcium deficiency is long continued an adult develops osteomalacia . The bones become soft and porous and contain less than the normal amount of calcium salts because they have been removed for more important functions in the active tissues . Even the animals do not escape . This disease is quite common among the grazing animals of France and is known as " Maladie de Nature . " Norway cattle have their share . Animals in southern Alabama and parts of Mississippi and Florida are frequently afflicted . This is probably due to deficient minerals in the soil . An investigator found the Cebidae monkeys of the Philadelphia Zoo to be victims . Normally healthy nations suffer in times of severe dietary stress , particularly in wartime . In 1923 there was a thorough investigation of " war osteomalacia " in Vienna . These examples of nature gone wrong merely show that if the ever-present mineral requirements of all animal life are disregarded once too often some severe malady is bound to put in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be most common with us , we are frequently short on iron . The difficulties of iron acquisition are no mere white man 's burden . They apply to black and white , ancient and modern . If you wonder how the ignorant savage survives in a game with such stringent rules , remember that he is much wiser in his use of the food resources which are available than is the average American or European . His life has not been depleted by the niceties of civilization , which means that he eats almost anything and more than that he eats all of it . He never misses the valuable impurities . If his environment dictates a vegetarian diet he eats copiously of such whole fruits , roots  | and vegetables as can be found . If he is carnivorous he literally consumes the animal and the most valuable part is the blood . Blood soup is one of the staple items of the Eskimo menu . Ancient Egyptians slaughtered their animals near their dwellings , slit the necks and collected the blood , which was saved and used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and sell it . A favorite pick-me-up of the modern Patagonian Indian is a mixture of raw liver , heart , kidneys and blood of a guanaco ( native antelope ) . The Spartans are still held up as the ideal hardy men . The most famous Spartan dish , served at their communal tables , was the black broth . There is no exact recipe for the original of this dish ? that is probably its reason for being famous ? but it was known to be blood , thickened in some way . Dr. Lister in his " Notes on Apicius " supposes that it was hogs ' blood . The broth may have been nutritionally excellent but gastronomically it lacked a certain delicacy . A citizen of Sybaris was privileged to eat at the common table and declared that it was no longer astonishing to him that the Spartans should be absolutely fearless in battle , since anyone would much rather die a thousand deaths than continue to exist on such miserable food . The principal virtue of blood as a food undoubtedly is that it furnishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day will supply the iron needs of a man if the iron is completely assimilated . No other food can approach that by several fold . In slaughter-houses this most valuable of foods is sometimes incorporated in stock feed and sometimes sold as fertilizer , while many human beings are hanging over the border of anemia . Such is the march of civilization and its refinements . We have let our sense of nicety overrun our quest for knowledge . Many of the primitive food practices that are unpleasant or odious have good physiological reasons for existence . We still have the same equipment that we had  | when we were stinking outcasts skulking in caves and we happen to need some of almost all the things they ate . We have substituted refinement and sanitation for thoroughgoing crudity and true omnivorousness and never asked if the course were wise . Until scientific developments enable us to rise above natural products it will behoove us to have more respect for the dietary practices of the men of the Old Stone Age ? not blindly , of course , for we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOIL Whether we subsist on animal or vegetable food the minerals which are so necessary to our lives must come from the soil ? there is no other source . When one considers what will happen when the soil becomes depleted in these vital elements our mineral requirements take on an ominous appearance . The matter can not be passed off lightly . It is not sufficient to suppose that the Lord will provide , for the Lord made no provision for dense populations and landdepleting activities . The natural way of animal life , be it remembered , is ashes to ashes and dust to dust . Nothing is taken away from the community . The food is obtained from local sources , the excreta left for the soil in exchange . When an animal dies he is supposed to decompose in place and return his material being to the soil from which it came . Civilization depletes the soil by sending the food to distant parts and getting nothing but useless checks and paper bills in exchange . When we die we are buried in boxes guaranteed to withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal roots can ever reach us . Excellent for sentiment but poor for plants . Every year millions of tons of human excreta containing the essential minerals pass down to the ocean when the sewers and sewage disposal plants rid themselves of their burden . More millions of tons are left in holes in the ground where no plant life can derive benefit , with the  | exception of the deep-rooted trees . This is good sanitation , probably absolutely necessary for a dense population , but it is n't good agriculture . It is a worthy objective to be sanitary and refined but we should count the cost and see to it that the ground is refertilized with artificial fertilizers that are complete in every respect . This is as yet not being done to any extent . The sewage disposal plant at Milwaukee , Wisconsin , takes in the sewer effluent of the city and produces a sterilized , dried and bagged fertilizer which sells at a premium . That is a reversion to Oriental practice ? with refinement . The universal practice in India of using cow dung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the nutritive value of Indian food crops . China , the oldest of civilizations , continues to exist only by returning to the land every bit of human and animal excreta available . This maintenance of soil fertility has been purchased by the perpetual incidence of every possible intestinal disease . The germs living in the human feces are transferred to the growing plant and the circle is closed by their return in this form to the human mouth . No Occidental dares eat an Oriental salad unless he uses a disinfecting solution for a salad dressing . We Americans have not had to resort to the use of human feces for fertilizer only because we have not had a dense population for thousands of years . But we have other bad habits . We not only deplete our soil for food removal but for textiles and raw materials for chemical industry . These are worthy advances of civilization , but they are dangerous practices for the nutrition of the future unless the agrobiologists learn the trick of completely re-fertilizing the soil . The feeble agricultural efforts of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds of potassium , nitrogen and phosphorus . It is not enough , not even for plants , much less for the grazing animals and for us . The phenomenon of soil depletion has been  | taken as a matter of course ever since the white man came to these shores . The worn-out farm has been as much a part of American life as apple pie . The remedy in previous years has been to move on to the western lands , but the Pacific Ocean has stopped that . We are by no means in danger of an immediate food shortage , but there is no question that the present average farm practice is leading straight toward a soil squeezed to utter depletion ? a situation which will have far more serious results than merely contracted incomes . Some of the districts in the Scottish Highlands can not support the populations which once lived there even though they accept the standard of living of their ancestors . This has taken place despite the fact that the agricultural activities are confined to animal-raising , which presumably keeps the soil elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they started shipping the animal products from the region . Attempts to explain the decline of previous civilizations on material grounds have led to considerable investigation and more speculation . Weather gets most of the credit for pushing the old powers off the map , but soil depletion has also been considered a large factor . The question is not only a matter of quantity of food produced but quality as well . A race with a definitely subnormal mineral intake will never retain its vigor . National lethargies might be due more to a shortage of copper , iron , iodine or manganese in the food than to any combination of exterior social forces . It is not at all impossible that as years of depletion pass by our foods will become more and more deficient in the necessary traces of minerals , and the average physical vigor of the people will suffer , for we are taking more from the soil and returning less than any group has ever done for any extended period of time . Already vegetables from some localities are decidedly below par in such essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the depletion of our soil  | resources are well ahead of the dogs of disaster , but they are doing a good turn in making the agro-scientists and part of the public soil-conscious . Fortunately for our own wellbeing , plants and farm animals have to have most of these same chemical elements that we do . It is too much to expect the average individual to take enough interest in himself to try to improve his own physical condition , but when the soil becomes obviously sterile and the yield per acre drops too low , or the cows and hogs fail to reproduce , or milk production becomes scant , he will listen to the advice of the agricultural scientists and if necessary he will even use fertilizer . Animals and plants have always stood higher in the estimation of the farmer than have human beings . The Middle West is plastered with magnificent barns for the animals , alongside decrepit and ramshackle human abodes . One of the greatest nuclei of the twentieth century 's knowledge of human nutrition was to be found at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such objective . It all began with a semi-public demand for experimental work to improve the feeding of Wisconsin farm animals . That the rations of pigs and cows could and should be improved by experimental study was obvious . The idea that human conditions could be improved by a study of nutrition was absurdly foreign to the minds of the agriculturally-bound legislature . Pigs can be sold for hard cash but the wife and kids can eat the same truck grandpappy did ; that 's good enough for them . The young scientists who were put to the task of cattle-feeding were possessed with enough of the broader vision to see that the real need was the experimental study of the human animal . By subterfuge , sideline activities , and evasion of issues , they adapted their study of nutritional needs to give information applicable to human beings , and incidentally to cows . By the time the farmers awakened to the fact that their appropriations were being wasted on a study of men and women it was too late ;  | the significance of the results and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced by its own momentum in spite of the cows . A great deal of experimental work is now being done on the finer points of fertilization . It has been well established that at least eleven mineral elements are necessary for plant growth . A few commercial fertilizers are already on the market which supply these eleven elements . Studies are being made of some of the areas where plants thrive , but cattle suffer from maladies traceable to cattle diseases such as " sweeny " or " creeping sickness , " which is due to a shortage of calcium in the soil and hence in the forage plants . Eventually , when the animals are all cared for , there will be studies to determine the soil 's mineral needs for the best human health . While there are cows there is hope .  | THE VITAMINS ? SUBTLE AND INDISPENSABLE IN THE days of witchcraft all manner of stews and brews had marvelous curative powers . Most of them were as fraudulent as love potions , but some of the tonics and doses concocted from herbs and animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sometimes wondrous wise , probably had beneficial effects that were more than psychological . As civilization roused from its Dark Age sleep there was an increasing number of observations of the marvelous curative effects of certain foods for certain diseases ? unexplainable and mysterious and vociferously discredited by the doctors of the past century . There are a number of diseases that have long been observed to visit a population when the food supply is poor . Medieval famines kept Death busy through the medium of scurvy . It would n't even spare the Crusaders , who really should have been exempt by divine intervention . Children with rickets and adults with osteomalacia and every conceivable form of rheumatism have always been more prevalent when food supply has been inadequate . Beriberi has cursed the Orient at least as far back as 2600 B. C. Europe before Columbus may well have represented the all-time low of mass health for any large group . The seminomadic woods life of the barbarians had been displaced by a fearsome huddling into permanent and utterly filthy villages and cities . A relatively raw climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Almost every disease of the world throve on the  | inexcusable crowding of unwashed medievalism . Agricultural methods were but little better than those of the aboriginals , and with the increasing population the quality of food was hopelessly inadequate , especially during winter months . Cast over it all was the enervating influence of the Church , which convinced everyone that the more he suffered today the greater his happiness would be in the world to come . As long as Europe was a land-locked civilization , scurvy was accepted as an act of God sent to punish the wicked and try the righteous . After Columbus , however , a few of the explorers saw fit to tamper with God 's way of doing things . Only through contact with the new outer worlds was Europe to rise from her auto-infecting lethargy . On Jacques Cartier 's second voyage to Newfoundland in 1535 " he wintered near an Indian village , Stavacona , in Quebec . Both the Indians and his crew were afflicted with scurvy . Between December and the middle of March , 25 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick that recovery was despaired of except for three or four . By the middle of March , Cartier noticed an Indian , whole and sound , who had been very ill with scurvy ten or twelve days earlier . He asked the Indian how he had healed himself and was told that he had taken the juice and sap of the leaves of a certain tree called Ameda . ' At Cartier 's request , the Indian had branches brought and showed how the bark and leaves should be boiled together and the resulting decoction taken every other day . So successful was the remedy that all Cartier 's crew were speedily completely cured , and the narrator goes on to say : It wrought so well , that if all the physicians of Montpelier and Louaine had been there , with all the drugs of Alexandria , they would not have done ? s much in one yere as that tree did in sixe days , for it did w ) preuaile , that as many as used it , by the Grace of God recouered their health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be he American spruce . "  | In 1593 , one Captain Hawkins cured his seriously ailing crew of scurvy by feeding them a small amount of lemon juice each day . He reported his marvelous find to the British Navy , but tradition was more powerful than evidence and nothing was done about it . In 1747 , James Lind , a surgeon of the British Navy , rediscovered that orange or lemon juice was a specific cure for scurvy . By 1795 the idea actually filtered into the mind of the British Admiralty and the Navy instituted the regular and compulsory administration of lime or lemon juice to the seamen ? hence the name " Limey " for the British gob . It was only 2o2 years after Captain Hawkins ' first experiments that the powers that were got the idea and did something about it . That 's a reasonably good reaction-time . Captain Cook of South Seas infamy kept his crews healthy by making use of the discovery that a raw onion a day keeps the scurvy away . Sometimes he used sauerkraut . His crews hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to eat that raw onion . But they did n't have scurvy . The nineteenth century brought a steadily increasing standard of living to the Western World . One of the outstanding causes was an improvement in agricultural practices which gave the inhabitants a greater assurance of a food supply that was adequate , at least in quantity . Scurvy as a widespread fatal disease faded into the background and appeared in only a relatively few isolated places . It still lurked in some dark corners . The sourdoughs of Klondike days who depended on dried and preserved foods when they wintered on location found scurvy coming in with the snow . Raw potatoes were the cure , so raw potatoes were sometimes exchangeable for gold , weight per weight . There were many severe outbreaks of scurvy among the troops in the World War , not because of lack of food but because of the ignorance of the responsible officers of the simplest principles of nutrition and its relation to health .  | With the gradual disappearance of this one disease which was obviously and indisputably due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public lost interest in cures by eating . For if a man was n't sick he must be well , and if he was n't sick there should be no tampering with him or his ways of living . The idea that sickness and health are purely relative and that there could be every degree of well-being did n't make much of an impression . Yet it is in the median ground of barely passable health that most of the recent nutritional advances have been made and where the great progress of the future will be found . One of the most common phenomena of American farm life has been the devitalizing effect of long winters . John the agriculturist invariably comes to the first of April disconsolate and irritable , feeling as if he had been dragged backwards through a patch of briers . As soon as he gets his teeth into a mess of greens that the old woman has been able to dig up in some warm fence corners , the world begins to brighten . It makes a new man of him . " The doctors say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all imagination , but there 's somethin ' about a mess o'greens that 's a real tonic . There 's some things them doctor fellers do n't know about . " This playlet has been enacted so many million times during the past generations that the . reality of the tonic power of the mess of greens can hardly be denied . The explanation is now quite simple . The person living on preserved and dried foods for several months probably does not obtain enough of vitamins A and C to keep his machine up to par . The deficiency has not been great enough to bring on actual disease but it does induce that general rotten feeling and puts one at outs with the world . Monkeys react the same way if kept on diets that are partially vitamin deficient . Dandelion greens , besides being sufficiently bitter to give a good psychological effect , furnish vitamins A and C and a goodly supply of minerals . Sulphur-and-molasses was n't bad medicine for the  | children , if the molasses was black , for then it contained iron for starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it passed right through , and it made the taste beneficially disagreeable . " An apple a day keeps the doctor away " is so old that no one knows anything about its origin except that it was not started by the doctor . It 's one old chestnut that happens to be sound , because of the vitamin content of apples . Probably a large part of the billions of man-hours lost during past centuries because of run-down , woefully tired , tuckered-out and no-good feelings have been directly or indirectly due to vitamin deficiency in the diet . The explanations and remedies of these incipient deficiencies did not come directly . Since there was no public or medical pressure to improve states of ill-health which were not quite bedridden cases , and since the methods of combating them were hardly more than folklore , no far-seeing experimentalists dabbled in the field . The opening key to the newer knowledge of nutrition was found in the Orient , where there were some maladies sufficiently serious and severe to make a cure obviously important , but with causes sufficiently obscure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities of Batavia and Surabaya , Dutch East Indies , two-thirds of the people suffered from the scourge of beriberi ( kak-ke to the Oriental ) ? essentially a nerve disease which brings anesthesia , paralysis , edema , loss of voice and finally the certain visitation of death . In 1889 , Dr. Christian Eijkman , one-time Professor of Hygiene in the University of Utrecht , one-time Director of the Hygienic Laboratory of Batavia , turned his observing Dutch eyes upon the fowls living in the bare dusty yard of the prison hospital of which he was the medical officer . These chickens showed stiffness and weakness of feet and legs that could hardly be due to climate or racial weakness for he had never seen it in any other East Indies chickens . The chickens ' symptoms re- minded him very much of those of his beriberi patients within the walls . Seventy per cent of the prisoners were afflicted . He pondered a bit and decided that this might be more than a coincidence for both the chickens and the prisoners ate the same food ? polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed them polished rice . They all acquired this polyneuritis which was practically a duplicate of human beriberi . When rice hulls were added to the diet the chickens obligingly made apparently miraculous recoveries . Eijkman 's hunch on the cause was one of the high points of nutritional history . A monument should mark the spot where he had this brain flash , for this was the first case of a nutritional deficiency disease experimentally induced upon animals . It started a chain of events that is displacing ignorance with knowledge , inadequate food with vitamins , and illness with health the world over . When his work was published back home it suffered the fate of every other really new idea : it was damned to the deepest hell . There was discussion but very little that was favorable . Obviously such a thing could not be true for it was not in keeping with any pharmacological knowledge ; besides it had come from east of Suez . It was a decade before the significance of the work began to be apparent , and forty years ( 1929 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be different . He nearly received it in absentia for he died in 1930 . Eijkman almost had a predecessor in this work . Japan in the eighties was very , very proud of her navy , with an enlisted force of 5,00o men , but distressed to have i , 000 to 2,000 of them always on the sick list with beriberi , and to see the mortality running 20 to 40 per cent . To combat this , German-educated Takaki , Director-General of the Medical Department of the Japanese Navy , began to make some dietary experiments " upon a scale of great magnitude . " A vessel , the Tsukaba , was sent on a 278-day cruise with a  | diet for the seamen that was more elaborate than usual . The proportion of vegetables and meat was increased and that of rice cut down . Milk was added . Excepting fourteen men who had refused to eat the new food , the crew returned from the cruise free of beriberi . Phenomenal ! Takaki thought the cause of the disease was dietary , but he could offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories of a protein balance . Japan by this time had adopted enough Occidental ways so that it would accept no new ideas and his theory was unanimously overruled by the doctors who knew . However , despite the fact that he might have absurd ideas , Takaki drew considerable water in the Japanese Navy and , right or wrong , was successful in getting regulations through to improve the diet , while others simultaneously saw to it that sanitary conditions were improved . The Japanese government gave credit to Takaki for saving Japanese sailors . He contended that better diet was the cause of improvement . All others were sure it was due to improved sanitary conditions . The sailors , entirely unaware of the dispute , enjoyed excellent health ? not a beriberi among them . These puffs of Oriental experimentation distressed the oldschool physiologists for a time , but the matter soon blew over so that it was possible to return to orthodox work on " most calories for your money " and high protein vs. low protein diets , without building up defenses against upstart ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing it was along conventional lines . As far as diseases were concerned , Pasteur 's germ theories explained all those ; there was no reason for nutritionists to work in that direction . Work was progressing nicely , perfection in diet was just around the corner when Professor Pekelharing ( pronounced Pekelharing ) of the University of Utrecht became another disturbing influence in 19o5 by reporting that white mice starved to death on a mixed diet of pure proteins , fats ,  | carbohydrates and mineral salts which according to the existing knowledge should be a perfect diet . If a small amount of milk were added to the rations the mice flourished . " There is a still unknown substance in milk , which , even in very small quantities , is of paramount importance to nourishment . If this substance is absent , the organism loses the power properly to assimilate the well-known principal parts of food , the appetite is lost and with apparent abundance the animals die of want . " At the same time on the other side of the channel an Englishman , F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eijkman and Pekelharing , was doing similar things with rats . In 1906 he briefly reported results paralleling those of Pekelharing . Rats on a presumably perfect diet died , but the addition of a very small quantity of milk brought them up to normal . He seemed to be completely unaware of the earlier published results of studies of these mysterious dietary deficiencies , but priority often has little to do with public recognition . In 1912 he published the results of very extensive animal experiments and emphasized the significance of these " accessory factors of diet , " such as undoubtedly existed in milk . For his work , in 1929 he received half of the Nobel Prize in medicine with Eijkman . The following years saw dozens of new workers coming into this field . They found mysterious somethings in milk , butter , and certain parts of vegetables or cereals which were indispensable for normal animal nutrition . But what were they ? Moreover , how did they act ? Were they living materials or only something associated with substances which had been alive ? Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence very difficult to corner in a test : tube . The rending of the veil of ignorance fell to a young Pole , Casimir Funk , working at the Lister Institute , London . In December , 1911 , his paper monument was erected which  | will outlast the Pyramids . It dealt with , " The Etiology of the Deficiency Diseases . " It was n't front page news but it should have been , even though not a single newspaper reader would have known what it was all about . In the few short pages allotted to him Funk described experiments which in essence verified Eijkman 's work and were extended to the finding of the causative factor . He extracted a substance from rice hulls ( where it was present to the extent of s of i per cent ) which when fed to fowls in very minute quantities cured them of the paralysis of polyneuritis within a few hours . For this white crystalline substance he coined a name , Vitamine . ( " Vita " for life , " amine " the name of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon shown that the life-giving material contained no amine the title stuck , not only with the researchers but also with the public , and it 's here to stay though it has dropped its " e . " Funk 's isolation of the active material was important , but the happy piece of word manufacture was more so . It gave something for the public mind to hang its thoughts on . It has been the chief agent of beneficial publicity for the newer knowledge of nutrition . Around the substances for which the name stands , a positive revolution in the world 's nutrition will eventually be brought about . Funk was just plain lucky . fle was only one jump ahead at the tape . Within six months after his paper , several others reported practically the same results from independent investigations that had been under way at the same time . Honor and chance are very close-linked . After 1912 all the experimenters in nutrition climbed on the wagon and began looking for this vitamin or these vitamins as the case might be . It proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex than anyone had imagined and the quantities were much smaller than even the worst pessimist supposed . The substance which Funk isolated and supposed to be the pure anti-neuritic factor was  | most impure . Instead of being present in rice hulls to the extent of s per cent as Funk thought , the concentration of the pure material is actually less than loon per cent . America was not exactly asleep during these vital years , though she did appear to be flat-footed when the starting gun was fired . But unsuspected events were appearing along America 's scientific horizon . One never can predict where men will rise ? or why . There was a retiring , though Scotch-Irish , jayhawker from the Kansas cornfields who got a tuition scholarship at Yale . Elmer Verner McCollum came to study organic chemistry . On the side he took some of the courses in physiological chemistry under Dean Chittenden , whose agile mind was determined to make nutrition an exact science or know the reason why . Came 1906 and graduation . The world seemed over-full of organic chemists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were men on the campus who knew a good thing when they saw it . Professor Lafayette B. Mendel , one of Chittenden 's earlier pupils and destined to be one of the top-flight men in America 's nutritional advance , had spotted McCollum 's earnestness and slow thoroughness . He persuaded him to stay for graduate work in physiological chemistry . Mendel was the sort of man who opened up the horizons for others . Undoubtedly during that time he led McCollum to see that there was a new field lying just outside the door that they , and any others who cared to join them , were duty-bound to explore . He kept McCollum as a laboratory assistant . A year later an offer came to McCollum from the University of Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station for feeding experiments on farm animals . " Take it , " Mendel must have said ; " it 's an opportunity . " Visions were narrow at Wisconsin . The feeding experiinents were to be extensive but with only one objective ? more and better calves and hogs , more money for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The agriculturists wanted the answer quickly . On May 1 , 1907 , McCollum started in on these calf-feeding experiments under the direction of Edwin B. Hart , probably with'some misgivings as to their scientific value . The experiments ran for several years and really were significant , but McCollum had a little bootleg business that was destined to be far more so . He saw that one could cover much more ground , nutritionally speaking , with small , fastbreeding animals . He wanted rats . Through proper connections he attempted to get $300 for rat experiments as a part of the Agricultural Experiment Station appropriation . The legislators would have no truck with such stuff . There were too many rats in Wisconsin ' already . Just what did this young squirt from Yale think he was up to ? McCollum raised his own rats . He probably bought some of the feed for them , too . This went on for years and he began finding out something about the essential factors of diet . In 1914 McCollum and Davis published a paper " Isolation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Growth . " The substance was vitamin A. The farmers pricked up their ears . They could understand butter fat . It meant something ; it meant dollars . Dairies are to Wisconsin as pretzels are to beer . Here was new advertising material for butter . It was a new club to use to pound oleomargarine out of existence . It was time to get a new weapon . McCollum could have all the rats he wanted , in fact the members of the legislature would be willing to go out to their own corn cribs , capture a few and bring them in . They would start rat farms if it would sell more butter . But there were better prospects for fundamental research at Johns Hopkins University , and in 1916 McCollum went there to become one of the principal figures in modern nutrition . Workers in the field now number in the thousands . The  | physiological or biochemical laboratories of pharmaceutical companies and universities all over the country are doing research on vitamins . When one visits the laboratory of a pharmaceutical company he addresses even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are young Ph.D 's on the threshold of a new field in vitamins . Medical research laboratories work out vitamin ideas and present them for clinical observation . Europe has continued contributing tremendously significant bits " now and then in intervals between armament research , but the flood has reached no such magnitude as it has in America . The literature references number many thousands . Production has been like that in a new oil field when a few new gushers have come into action . And as in an oil field the production in this new branch of knowledge will rise to a peak and then slowly fall off in that descending curve of lessening activity which denotes senility in research as in men . This subject will never completely die , but when the limits of achievement have been outlined and most of the possible material benefits realized , the toprank workers will leave for other fields and the underlings will potter around doing the knitting work . When the final material is all assembled and some great correlator abstracts the essential knowledge of vitamins , our present groping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criss-crossings of a six-year-old on an errand . Naturally the first vitamin work was biological . But recently many organic chemists have been drawn into the field in an attempt to find the exact chemical structures of these extremely complex materials . The exact chemical formulae of the principal members of the vitamin groups ? A , B , C , D and G ? are known . Vitamins B and C are synthesized commercially as pure crystals and may be purchased as recognized pharmaceuticals . Vitamin D is made by irradiating ergosterol , extracted from yeast , with ultraviolet light . In the concentrated oil solution , Viosterol , it  | replaces many tons of cod liver oil every year . Another of the eight vitamins , D , has also been synthesized by straight chemical means . This business of controlling our bodies is by no means being left to nature 's haphazardness and whims . The organic chemists are going to bring nutrition into the realm of the most exact sciences . For the most part , however , we obtain our vitamins directly from foods ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments to the rules . Vitamin A can be obtained from fish livers and a variety of other foods of animal origin , or our bodies can manufacture it from carotene found in green leaves and some tubers . The body can manufacture its own vitamin D from the ergosterol on or near the skin , if exposed to sunshine . The functions and attributes of the vitamins are so varied , interesting and important that each of them deserves at least a few paragraphs to itself . VITAMIN A As soon as researchers said that an abundance of vitamin A helped to prevent infections of the respiratory tract , manufacturers of cough and cold medicines began to preach the curative qualities of their products into which they had squeezed a bit of vitamin A concentrate . It 's hard to say how many additional dollars this has brought them but they have certainly almost all been garnered on a false premise . As far as colds or other respiratory diseases are concerned this vitamin shows no evidence of being curative though it does seem to have a preventive function . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only definite evidence is that it increases the secretions of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat . Apparently this helps , but it is by no means a prevent-all and certainly not a cureall . Vitamin A is also necessary for the response of the human eye to certain wave-lengths of light . The usual result  | of a mild deficiency of vitamin A is a case of night blindness or inability to see in dim light , especially prevalent in children . Although there may be no detectable results more serious than inconvenience in this malady , the deficiency may well be the fundamental cause of a great many eye weaknesses and difficulties . Like a cold , it is nothing to be neglected . Do n't assume that this is a rare condition . Investigation of a typical group of Iowa school children showed that 26 per cent of the rural moppets and 53 per cent of villagers ' progeny were distinctly night blind ; and Iowa is probably better fed than the average American community . Nearly every case was cured by a diet high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair sample of adults who drive cars has shown that probably 10 per cent of the American drivers are victims of night blindness . The defect in all probability is due to a mild vitamin A deficiency in the average American diet . Night blindness may be of small consequence , but total blindness is not so easy to pass off and that is one of the final results of continued serious deficiency of this first of the vitamins . Xerophthalmia or , less pretentiously , conjunctivitis , is an eye inflammation often leading to blindness . It has long been known to be associated with dietary deficiencies , but no one was able to put a finger on the connection until the existence of vitamin A was definitely established . People , children especially , who have no green vegetables , milk , butter or cod liver oil in their diet are certainly headed for eye trouble . Denmark found that out when , during the first years of the World War , she shortsightedly sold most of her dairy products to Germany at such abnormally high prices that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented heights and by 1917 seemed well on the way to driving the nation blind . It is not the first time health has been exchanged for gold . In December , 1917 , the authorities awoke to the fact that Danish thriftiness in selling all the butter  |p124.  out of the land was bringing the nation to a sad state , and decided to do something about it . The supply for domestic consumption was rationed at a little less than one halfpound per person per week , and the price was fixed so low that almost everyone began using butter again . Within a year xerophthalmia had almost passed out of the record . The butter-rationing and price-fixing were terminated in 192o because the crisis was past . Some of the more foolish of the Danes had not learned their lesson and they began selling all their butter over the line again . You could n't expect a dairyman to waste butter on his children when to sell it meant kroner in his pocket . The eye troubles mounted , though they were by no means as serious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this greatest dairy nation on earth brought to the point of using enough of its own butter to keep the nation in good health . The permanent indirect injury to the young  | of that generation is inestimable and will only show up as it lives out its allotted span . The accompanying figure of one hospital 's admissions shows the relation between xerophthalmia and the lack of butter beyond all possible dispute . Despite their policy of eating all of everything available , the Chinese are afflicted with numerous deficiencies . High prevalence of blindness is attributed to lack of sufficient vitamin A. Rice and soy beans are the dietary mainstays and they are especially deficient in A. They have almost no dairy products and when the supply of green stuffs is low it is just too bad for the eyes . The deleterious effect of A deficiency on the eyes is probably connected with malfunctioning of the nerves . It has been found that there is a general deterioration of the peripheral nerves of the body when A is deficient , often causing nervous lesions . The respiratory tract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for one vitamin to take care of , but vitamin A has many more duties . It is essential for growth , reproduction and lactation and the maintenance of bodily vigor at every stage of existence . Life without vitamin A is hardly worth while . VITAMIN B Vitamin A is associated with and soluble in fats , but vitamin B is a very different creature and rules in different fields . It is water-soluble and appetite-inducing . Many an unruly infant who refuses to eat under the pressure of all known human methods is not suffering from stubbornness handed down from the other parent , but from a far simpler thing ? lack of vitamin B. In such cases the administration of a few doses of some of the numerous vitamin B concentrates on the market will bring on a hungry and peaceful interlude . The exact amount of vitamin B for optimum human  | health is not known , but the minimum intake necessary to prevent beriberi or other severe nervous disturbances has been well established by the extensive investigational work of nutrition-expert George R. Cowgill . Vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several-fold greater than those for the prevention of an actual pathological condition . A survey of some Soo American dietaries has shown that most of them did not have enough B for optimum health . ( The vitamin requirements are always reported in arbitrary units and so are meaningless except to the specialist , but the selection of particular foods required to supply the amount necessary for good health is reported in the appendix ? Table II . ) Since this vitamin has a direct effect upon the nervous system , experiments with it are often astounding . It even reaches in and takes one of the horrible examples away from the W.C.T.U. Dr. Maurice B. Strauss reported a complete cure for seventy-five cases of whiskey paralysis ( alcoholic polyneuritis ) produced by putting the patients on a proper diet , containing a great deal of vitamin B. These chronic drinkers were not suffering from alcoholic poisoning , despite the fact that some drank an average of a quart and a half of whiskey per day , but were starving for the most essential elements of diet , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whiskey furnishes 2,800 calories ? almost a day 's supply . The victim starves because he does not feel hungry and eats nothing else . Just to show that alcohol was not the cause of the paralysis , ten of the seventy-five patients were kept drunk , in greater or less degree , all during their cure . The diet which cured all cases was , in addition to whiskey : eggs , milk , meat , orange juice , green vegetables , yeast and a vitamin B concentrate . Some were cured of all paralysis and psychoses in two weeks ; the toughest one took four months . There are a number of good arguments for teetotalism  | but something must be thought of to take the place of alcoholic poisoning , for vitamin B has robbed it of part of its effectiveness . In common with most of the other vitamins , B is necessary for normal growth . There is probably some connection between its growth- and appetite-inducing properties . It very likely stimulates appetite by inducing flow of the gastric juices , and this in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . B presumably controls sexual as well as stomach appetite . Rats with diets low in B cease having desire for sexual intercourse . Men are so much like rats in their reactions that presumably the same condition holds for human beings . However , no experiment has yet been controlled with a sufficient degree of intimacy to be certain of that . The defect might be one of incipient starvation , for not even a rat can be particularly interested in intimacies with the opposite sex when he is starving to death . The link between diet and the effectiveness of sex can occasionally be traced . St. Croix , of that group of U. S. liabilities , the Virgin Islands , has had an abnormally low native birth rate . Until about 1933 the diet consisted principally of corn meal and fish , with an occasional exploration into the delicacies of sugar-cane . Then tomatoes were introduced for commercial cultivation . Natives began eating them , not because they relished them but because there was not much else . Within the requisite number of months the birth rate began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vitamins A , B and C. Vitamin B , through the agency of the increased aggressiveness of the native male , is probably partially responsible for this hump in the curve of the vital statistics of St. Croix . VITAMIN C When Ponce de Leon came looking for the fountain of youth he missed a good bet by not staying home and eating  | Spanish oranges . The citrus fruits are good sources of vitamin C , and this accommodating substance has certain properties which help to preserve the characteristics of youth . This is n't rejuvenation propaganda but an unadorned experimental fact . The beneficial effects are by no means in keeping with Ponce 's rosy ambitions , but indications are that length of life may be increased by as much as ten per cent if vitamin C intake ( along with some other factors ) is raised from a subnormal to an optimum level . Ten per cent in a human life is several years ; its worth eating for . The citrus fruit growers have not yet advertised " Eat Oranges and Linger Long " but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every fact is greatly benefited by having an explanation . The explanation here lies in the blood capillaries . If C. is deficient , the capillary walls are fragile ; if C is ample the walls are strong . This capillary strength seems to have a great deal of bearing upon the state of health . In some cases the beneficial effects can be narrowed down to something more specific . Under the stress of combating a toxin , an adequate vitamin C supply may be the determining factor in the prevention of arteriosclerosis ( hardening of the arteries ) . It is not necessary to wait until the age of 70 to begin drawing dividends on the imbibing of vitamin C. Children short on C , even though they are well above the scurvy line , lack stamina , are retarded in growth and are excessively irritable . Lemons , oranges , fresh fruits and vegetables help bring their physiques up to par and transform their dispositions . Teeth also feel a shortage of C. If the shortage is severe enough to cause scurvy , the teeth fallout ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other factors enter into tooth decay , hence vitamin C is not the dental panacea that some past enthusiasts would have it , but it is one of the important items . Wounds heal much better if the intake of C is high . Bones are not unrelated to teeth , and further , quick healing  | of wounds is one of the characteristics of youth . There seem to be quite a few connecting links in the pattern . ( For further discussion see Part Four , Chapter II . ) Occasionally , miraculous cures by large doses of C are brought forth to be promptly pooh-poohed by the old-time medics who rely on sugar pills and the bedside manner , but the claims of some can hardly be denied . Hemophilia ( lack of blood-clotting ability ) can sometimes be combated with dosages of this vitamin . Vitamin C made it possible to perform a major operation on the hemophilic son of Alfonso , one-tune King of Spain . Had it not been for this vitamin he would have died , with or without the operation . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handling of bleeding , it was found that the chemically pure synthesized vitamin C ( 1-ascorbic acid ) was not a preventive . The true active material for the prevention of this affliction was a small fraction of another material , momentarily called vitamin P , which is closely associated with C in natural materials such as lemon juices . It is simply another example of the complexity of the vitamin situation . Colitis , a disease involving inflammation of the large intestine , was a fashionable disease during part of the eighteen hundreds . This was a period when those who had n't much to do must have at least one serious ailment for a mark of distinction as well as for a subject of conversation . Appendicitis had its day but from the doctor 's point of view it was not a satisfactory disease , for in order to keep up patient-interest it must be an acute case , and it was generally known that acute cases did n't last long . Colitis lingered , justifying daily visits of the practitioner over extended periods . There were epidemics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material for a fashionable disease because the discomfort and consequences are much too severe to be enjoyable . The inflammation at first is very irritating and diarrhea  | becomes severe . Assimilation of food is faulty and death may come from something approximating starvation . The authors know of one case of colitis cured by synthetic vitamin C which can well be put in the " Remarkable " column . Dr. Harold Sox of Palo Alto , California , had a colitis patient whose condition of discomfort and starvation had for months been growing steadily worse . Dr. Sox referred to some European literature on the use of vitamin C in this kind of case . He began administering synthetic vitamin C , ascorbic acid . Within three weeks the cure was practically complete except for the regaining of strength and weight . The reason for this cure can be perceived if one remembers that vitamin C somehow brings about a strengthening of the walls of the blood capillaries . Colitis probably involves a fragility of the mucous membrane . Strengthening the capillaries should overcome this weakness . Frequent nosebleedings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of C. A liberal supply of vitamin C protects guinea pigs against peptic ulcers and intestinal tuberculosis . This probably applies to man too . Since maladies usually arise from multiple and complicated causes the remedy in one case may be ineffective in another . This is the reason why it is difficult to establish the efficacy of given remedies , for the results never follow a simple pattern . The opponents and the proponents can both use the same clinical data to prove their point , and new ideas and methods always meet with an argumentative reception . The phenomenal results in these vitamin cures are undoubtedly authentic even though these substances are by no means cure-alls . When the principal cause of a malady is a particular shortage and the practitioner does the right thing , he gets results that seem like the laying on of hands . The obvious lesson , for those who will read , is that the dietary should be so complete that these shortages will have no  | chance to arise even if the body 's assimilative mechanism is somewhat off balance . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it points to the fact that vitamin C shortage is back of many hitherto unexplainable human afflictions . It is n't necessary to reach the point of obvious scurvy to be injured by shortage of C. Insufficient supply has no immediate effect but can lead to unpleasant results , ranging from decaying teeth and colitis to loss of youthfulness on the part of the tissues . It is quite erroneous to assume that it is only the other fellow who could possibly need this substance . There are simple tests which indicate shortages in the living tissue and there has been intensive investigation of this malnutrition . Groups of children from the economically poorer homes admitted to the Grasslands Hospital , Westchester County , New York , showed distinct vitamin shortages in from 35 to 66 per cent of the cases . But the shortage is by no means confined to the unfortunate economic strata . The analyses of human tissues obtained from autopsies which covered a good cross-section of American life showed that approximately one-fifth of the people represented had vitamin C intake distinctly below that conducive to health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruits are mere pap for more delicate stomachs , there is a reasonably good chance that you are the one of every five who would register a shortage . Nature has not raised the vitamin C requirements ? they are the same as they always were . In normal nutrition it is not necessary to look to synthetic vitamin C. for sufficiency . If one eats a good sample of the various foods that nature offers he will fulfill all the requirements very satisfactorily . The principal sources of C are fresh green leaves , growing shoots , juicy stems , roots , tubers , bulbs and fruits . The best individual sources are oranges , lemons , grapefruit , ( raw or canned ) , tomatoes , ( raw or canned ) and raw cabbage and  | onions . Most of the raw leafy vegetables ( salads ) are good . Apples , bananas , carrots and potatoes contain some , but they are important sources only if eaten in large amounts . A pint of the best raw milk per day furnishes enough C for the average child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feed of the cows . There is usually considerable loss upon pasteurization . Raw meat contains some vitamin C but very little is retained when it is cooked . Eskimos get theirs by eating raw liver . If you wo n't eat your lettuce , eat your meat raw , just as the aboriginals did . VITAMIN D The swigging of cod liver oil is an old Scandinavian custom probably dating back at least as far as the Vikings . The physical hardihood of these old-timers , whose workmanlike butcheries kept the European coast on the anxious seat for centuries , can probably be attributed to their barbaric foods . The racial stamina of this people was such that no outside army ever went in and took the country . If the hardihood of a race is measured by physical endurance , effectiveness in personal combat , and persistence in surviving under severe conditions , there are other people who have certainly been the Scandinavian equal . The inhabitants of the Arabian desert might stand favorably in comparison . If the physical vigor of the Scandinavian is explainable by cod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants of the Arabian desert , where the broiling sun precludes the existence of bodies of water much larger than a gold-fish bowl and fish are practically unobtainable . There must then be some other explanation . Is there a correlation between cod liver oil and sunshine in human nutrition ? The tracing of this relationship has been one of the really fascinating stories of biological research . We Americans have long been accustomed to the virtues of cod liver oil as a medicine , a sort of grandmother remedy ,  | in all manner of ailments . We undoubtedly got the idea from the English , for the oil was standard medicine in Scotland and Shetland for " old pains . " In the late eighteenth century it began to receive recognition as a medicine from English physicians . A tradition was gradually built up that it was specifically effective in the prevention of the weak , twisted bones and knotted joints of children 's rickets , and for treatment of chronic rheumatism . It is an idea whose origin is as indefinite as that of folk songs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the nineteenth century who knew what things were worth while in life . In his journal of January 27 , 1899 , Arnold Bennett quotes an omnibus driver : " I 've driven these roads for eight-and-twenty year , and the only pal I 've found is codliver oil . From September to March I takes it , and I never has colds nor nothing o ' that sort . I give it to my children ever since they was born and now I 'm blest if they do n't cry for it . " One of the best indications of the probable extent of rickets in the early days is seen in the more famous paintings of the Madonna and Child . The infant Jesus would presumably be as nearly perfect as the artist could make him . In most of the pictures he was painted with legs bearing all the symptoms of rickets . The artist had no idea it was not normal for young children . But there were individuals who never had cod liver oil and whose health seemed to be passingly good . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past that children in the lower economic strata who led a rowdy outdoor life were often less prone to rickets than some of their betterfed economic superiors . In the intermediate years of struggle for refinement in Western civilization , exposure to the elements was held to be a little uncouth , particularly for the ladies . Among that class of people who had neither to toil nor to spin , lily-white  | skin ranked with the long finger nails of the Chinese mandarins as a badge of the leisure class . Yet faint traces of the idea that sunshine had therapeutic properties still survived in the public mind . An invalid of the Victorian era would be given sunshine in discreet doses , though a shameless fullfledged sun-bath was probably not tolerated . The extreme prudishness of a civilization which , until the very recent past , practically confined pregnant women within opaque walls , wrought far greater havoc on their bone structure and general health than did the developing fetus within their wombs . In North China the poor but proud suffer in much the same way as Victorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which keep these women indoors . If a middle-class ' woman were seen taking a brisk walk she might be thought ' . to be engaged on some menial errand , a stigma which could , never be entirely removed . Hence females , particularly pregnant ones , stay indoors and in their pale-skinned seclusion suffer the pangs of malformed , deficient and creaking bones . There is not enough money to buy adequate food even if the proper diet were known . Because of the lack of a small allotment of sunshine this class seems on the way out . Pride goeth before a fall . The lower-class women work outof-doors and despite inadequate diets suffer from osteomalacia but little . Refinement does sad things to the race . Perhaps Japan and Young China are going to change all that . Mohammedanism demands that , beginning with the dangerous age , women shall be secluded , at least behind a screen ( purdah ) , preferably behind opaque walls . In Arabian deserts this may be all right , but in northern India it is proving almost fatal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not permit it . The diet does not make up this deficiency . These recluses suffer the severe pain , deformities and lethargies of adult rickets . They bear  | children relatively seldom and not at all successfully . The bones and teeth of the children tend to be deficient . Hence the upper class is rapidly losing that bare pittance of animal vigor which is necessary for survival . To the low-caste women the restrictions of purdah mean nothing . One must eat first , the affairs of the soul can come afterward . Low-caste women work out-of-doors . Much is wrong with their life and diet but they do not suffer greatly from the bone deformities and they are successful child-bearers . In terms of physical material the common denominator of the health-giving properties of cod liver oil and of sunshine is vitamin D. If we take cod liver oil we let the fish manufacture this vitamin for us . If we expose our bodies to sunshine we make it for ourselves by the irradiation of minute traces of the compound ergosterol on or immediately under the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol , which the animal body apparently manufactures from fats . It is found in relatively large proportions in the brain and to the extent of zg per cent in human skin ' fat . It is the major constituent of gall stones . It is chemically related to the compounds of the sex hormones and is also a not distant relative of a material that induces cancer in cancer-susceptible animals . The good things seldom come undiluted . Plants , too , manufacture cholesterol and they produce traces of ergosterol along with it . If ergosterol in animal skin is converted to vitamin D when exposed to ultra-violet light , then plants if dried in the sun should show the same effect . Had there been any conception of vitamins in z 854 one man might possibly have stumbled onto this fact . An Englishman , Dr. Thompson , had been investigating the beneficial effects of cod liver oil on the anemia of tuberculosis . He tried other oils with the result that " the use of almond oil and of olive oil was not followed by any remedial effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as de- cided as from the oil of the liver of the cod . " The cocoanut oil had come from sun-dried copra . It was a discovery of extreme significance , but in the cupboard of human knowledge at that time there was no pigeonhole into which it could be placed , so the idea that the remedial effects of sunlight could be stored in plants went into discard for 70 years . The written record of the benefit of sun-dried copra in disease suggests another possible defect which the refinements of civilization have brought upon us . Indians dried their strips of meat in the sun . Our grandparents dried corn , apples and peaches in the sun , a few flies more or less making but little difference . Most of our dried foods now come from the dark ovens of a factory . If we did the drying ourselves we probably would n't do it in the sun . It would be too much trouble and besides , think of the germs out-of-doors . It is a good thing to think of the germs , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foodstuffs was worth while , too . Though recent changes have made these speculations rather insignificant , this is another example of a practice discarded in the interest of ease or refinement which may really have had great physiological value . In an investigation of the Lapps , Swedes and Finns , Schenck found the Lapps free from rickets , even though living indoors with very little sunlight , while in the same type of region the Swedes and Finns were afflicted with rickets . He found the difference to be due to the fact that Lapp mothers nursed their babies much longer , but a more important fact was that the Lapps all ate sun-dried fish which was probably very rich in vitamin D. In 1924 , two Americans , A. F. Hess and H. Steenbock , working independently , almost simultaneously re-discovered this therapeutic effect of ultra-violet light . There was a scientific framework into which it could be placed and effects have been inestimable . It was found that if cotton- seed oil , linseed oil , muscle tissue , mixed feed or fats were exposed to ultra-violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of cod liver oil . Vitamin D had been formed from the ergosterol . The list has been extended to include lard , cereals and cereal products , milk , egg yolk , yeast , orange juice , lettuce and spinach . The most concentrated of all vitamin D products is that which is marketed in oil solutions under the name of Viosterol . It is made by extracting the ergosterol from yeast , where it is present in relatively large amounts , and irradiating it with ultra-violet light . One gram of this irradiated ergosterol has a vitamin D content equal to one ton of the best cod liver oil . The Viosterol is made by a pharmaceutical company of Evansville , Indiana , in a very small and very unassuming brick building . One man operates this plant and this single individual can make as much vitamin D as all the cod-fishers in the world can gather from the livers of their catch . It is an item of more import than mere interest . It has a great deal of bearing on the future of nutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was patented by Dr. Steenbock . The patent was assigned to the University of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation , which receives royalties from all of the manufacturers who irradiate products to increase the vitamin D content . It is a non-profit organization and the income goes to finance still further scientific research . Every time you buy Viosterol , irradiated cereal products , or irradiated milk , you are contributing a little to biological research which may have still greater significance in the future of human health . The vitamin D developments rob the critics of one of their best weapons . The stock argument of those who disapprove of all modern nutritional theories boils down to this : If all this cod liver oil ( or something else ) is necessary for the modern child how did my great-grandpappy pull through ? As far as the cod liver oil is concerned great- grandpappy pulled through because he was out-of-doors a great deal and the sunshine beating on his ergosterol-laden skin supplied him with vitamin D. But he probably did n't get enough . He may have been rickety when young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savages in warm countries did better , they went naked until missionaries came along and ruined their health by putting clothes on them . Savages in cold northern countries ate raw meat , all the vital organs and fish livers . White man was never smart enough to resort to one of these expedients , until he learned about cod liver oil and later about irradiation . Man 's natural vitamin D factory is in the practically hairless skin . The fur- and hair-bearing animals and the birds have a little different arrangement . With the exception of some of the carnivorous animals they do not get vitamin D in the diet so they must manufacture it . When birds " preen " themselves they distribute the oil of the preen gland over the feathers ; irradiation forms vitamin D , which is absorbed into the body through the feathers . If the preen gland is removed the bird will get rickets . Rats normally exposed to irradiation and an adequate diet do not get rickets . If the same rats are prevented from licking themselves they become rachitic , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not absorb vitamin D through the skin but has to take it through his mouth . Perhaps that is the way it is with cats that are always licking themselves . If the hair of a rabbit is kept washed with ether , to remove fats and oils , the animal develops rickets even if irradiated , and there are other animals in which cleanliness is next to rickets . It is commonly known that horses that are thoroughly scrubbed with soap and water do not thrive . The accumulated layer of body secretions in the hair or fur of these animals is apparently the seat of manufacture of the essential vitamin D. Since it has become customary , because of the sensitivity of the modern human nose ,  | to keep the household dog well washed , the manufacturers of canine food have found it necessary to put vitamin D into the can or biscuit . In the old days when the dogs were left dirty they did n't need the vitamin D. The Australian aborigines rubbed whale blubber over their bodies and we may be sure that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D was synthesized from the ergosterol of the fat by the sun 's rays and absorbed . These people were doubly fortified with the anti-rachitic factor . Some primitive tribes make the same use of fats today . If one extends this argument to its logical conclusion he soon comes to our civilization and is quite justified in enquiring : How about this pernicious habit of bathing ? Since we do n't have much fur left it may be different with us . If the vitamin D synthesis in the presence of sunshine takes place under the outermost layer of skin , then bathing will not remove it . If it is on the surface , and we all have an oily skin , we may be like the horses , and bathing may be a habit deleterious to our bones and teeth . It is probably more satisfactory to all concerned if we indulge in bathing and then , just to be safe , offset the possible ill effects by getting out-of-doors , drinking milk , eating eggs or even trying some cod liver oil . Vitamin D assimilation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has any deleterious effects in large doses . There have been no fatal poisonings with vitamin D , but heavy dosages given to hay fever patients ( from several hundred to several thousand times the normal intake ) have caused serious discomfort . At one time there was a great deal of aspersion cast upon the use of the vitamin D concentrates because some German workers had found some serious effects from administering their concentrate corresponding to Viosterol . The material used , however , had been improperly irradiated and contained an additional producttoxisterol ? which really is toxic . Careful manufacture prevents this . It seems likely that a human being can with- stand an over-dosage of vitamin D of a few hundredfold and not be seriously inconvenienced . The idea that it promotes hardening of the arteries has been disproven . If one should swallow ? a whole bottle-full of Viosterol he might vomit and have cramps and diarrhea , but there is no danger of getting too much in food or in normal dosages of the concentrates . Nature has cooperated very nicely in the matter of giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin D picture is not overdosage but under-dosage . A large proportion of the population , particularly the young , do not get enough sunshine or vitamin D. Their bones show it and especially do their teeth tell of the inadequacy . Evidence that this is true can be found in a survey by Eliot , who found mild rickets in 86 per cent of 600 infants , under one year of age , examined in New Haven , Connecticut . As recently as 1921 it was reliably reported by two competent investigators , Hess and Unger , that " rickets is the most common nutritional disease occurring among children of the temperate zone . Fully three-fourths of the infants in the great cities , such as New York , show rachitic signs to some degree . " Almost all the infants among the Negro population were found to have rickets , and the incidence was almost as great in the Italian district of the city . Our diet for infants is steadily being improved so the situation is better than it was in 1921 , but it is probably still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one of the most common nutritional diseases occurring among our children . The rickets story is very much the same all over the world . In lands that have been investigated there has always been a high incidence ? seldom less than So per cent ? among children . It appears that there is still much work for cod liver oil and Viosterol to do . Since we insist on wearing clothes we must have vitamin D from other sources than sunshine if our health is to be up  | to par . We are still a long way below the optimum national intake for human beings . Young bones are crooked , the dentists thrive on our rotten teeth , yet the bulk of the vitamin D concentrates is sold , to the manufacturers of prepared chicken feed , for everyone who can count has found that vitamin D in the feed increases the egg production . Eggs can be sold for money ? good , hard cash . VITAMIN E Vitamin E is sometimes called the sex vitamin , and hence should be popular , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B more nearly fill that bill , for sex interest wanes with their deficiency . Vitamin E is truly the keystone of fertility , for without a sufficient supply of it , sexual intercourse is fruitless ? at least there is no offspring . The deficiency makes itself felt differently in the male and female . A woman with a shortage of E may develop embryos but they die and are reabsorbed . The functions of the organs themselves , however , seem to be unimpaired . In the male , however , a shortage soon shows itself in the presence of sterile sperm . With further shortage there are no sperm . Finally he becomes impotent and after that loses sex interest . There is permanent injury to the sex organs which subsequent abundance of the necessary vitamin will never repair . The rather common : occurrence of vitamin E suggests that it is necessary for the normal functioning of the body . Just what role this vitamin plays in the life-story of plants , no one is certain . It is widespread throughout the plant world , is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the foliage of lettuce , watercress and alfalfa have their share . There is no reason to believe that it has anything to do with the reproductive processes of plants , though such might conceivably be the case . It is sufficiently widespread throughout the vegetable kingdom  | to make a sufficient supply for the perpetuation of the race assured to herbivores or omnivores , but the exclusively meat-eating animals were almost left out . It occurs , though not abundantly , in muscle meats . That is the only barrier which keeps the carnivores from race extinction . Nature 's occasional frugality is shown by the fact that this is the only vitamin which does not occur to greater or less degree in milk . But then sucklings should not be interested in procreation . Among the busy little bees , queens are made , not born . Larvae from the eggs laid by the queen , left to the usual course of feeding , develop into workers that are sexually sterile though by no means impotent with the stinger . However , some few of the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection is made is as yet unknown , for so far no one has probed the workings of the apian mind . It may be decided by the incumbent queen , or it may be the only instrument of defense which the working proletariat has against autocracy . All larvae are fed royal jelly for three or four days and then all those not destined to be queens are put on an ordinary diet while the prospective queen is continually fed royal jelly by the nurse bees who were once potentially female but who have taken the veil . Royal jelly is the ordinary pre-digested bee-bread to which the nurse has added vitamin E , which is part of the secretion of the pharyngeal gland . This larva maintained on a vitamin E diet becomes a queen ; the touch of vitamin is all that sets her apart from hoi polloi . The adult queen when she swings into action lays as many as 2000 eggs per day . It is a great strain on reproductive substance . During her egg-laying period she is still fed the royal jelly containing vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all children 's books on the life of the bee . But how is one to explain the intricacies of vitamin E to the children ?  | VITAMIN G Many a lusty battle ( in so far as scholars can battle ) has been fought over vitamin G. They have centered around the disease ( relatively unknown to Yankees ) of pellagra , which is distressingly prevalent in parts of our southern states . In 1929 there were 2oo,000 persons in the United States suffering from pellagra . Chief combatant in the struggle was one Dr. Joseph Goldberger about whom Horatio Alger , Jr. , certainly should have known . Joseph was born in Hungary . His parents took him from his native Carpathian Mountains to a grocery store on the New York East Side . This was in i880 . Twenty years later he was a young M.D. , inspecting immigrants with a sympathetic eye , at the same Ellis Island where he had entered . He was soon put into the service of the U. S. National Institute of Health . About this time field-workers of the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was devastating the poorer sections of the South , incapacitating people , driving them crazy , killingthem . Goldberger was sent down toinvestigate the insane asylums which were the final refuge of a large proportion of the victims . Fortunately he was not handicapped by any presuppositions about the disease . He poked into filthy homes and learned intimate things about farms , mill towns , orphanages , jails and asylums . It was rather stomach-turning even for a medic , for pellagra is one of the least attractive of diseases . The characteristic symptoms are very raw rashes and skin sores , sore mouths , sore joints and muscles , accompanied by dizziness , nervousness , and not infrequently , insanity . One thing which stood out in the investigation was that even in the most disease-ridden asylums no doctors or nurses ever had the disease . This seemed to rule contagion out . During the years in his father 's East Side grocery store , Goldberger had become an observer of human phenomena . He followed a hunch , which only a suspicious East-Sider  | would have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was distinctly superior in quality to that left for the patients , even though authorities self-righteously informed him that the diet was the same for all . He found an excellent correlation between diet and incidence of pellagra throughout the entire South . Where the food was essentially confined to cornbread , grits and fat sow-back , there was pellagra . Corneating peoples are definitely more susceptible to the disease than those who do not have access to this gift of the Aztecs . Where there was lean meat , milk and fresh vegetables there was no pellagra . Goldberger tried to give himself the disease by scratching his skin with material from pellagra sores . He was on an adequate diet and never contracted the disease . But there were many bitter skeptics , because every new idea is someone 's enemy . Moreover , the case was complicated to such an extent that it was evidently a question of more than a simple deficiency . At one time the disease was thought to be caused by a sensitivity to protein . Then Goldberger started an experiment which if successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed a social experiment which is often proposed but seldom tried ? he used penitentiary prisoners who volunteered to be human guinea pigs . Their reward was to be freedom ? if they lived . Eleven men on the Kankin Prison Farm of the Mississippi State Penitentiary were kept on a diet which usually produced pellagra . Six of them did get it . The controls were given the same food with the addition of small amounts of milk , butter , lean meat and eggs . None of the controls got it . Goldberger overestimated human intelligence when he thought this would convince the skeptics that pellagra was essentially a dietary deficiency disease . Precise evidence has n't the slightest effect on a prejudice and so when he died of a tumor of the kidney on January 17 , i929 , Goldberger was still fighting to break through the armor of those  | to whom a new idea is poison . The argument about the role of diet in pellagra still simmers along , for there is evidence that it is a combination of a deficiency of at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt that an adequate diet is a sure-fire preventive . Good food ? no pellagra ; Goldberger proved it . During the depression of the early thirties the American Red Cross heeded Goldberger 's teachings , distributed yeast to the Southern poor whites , and encouraged and helped them plant vegetable gardens . Changing the diet of a prejudiced group of people is the most difficult and thankless of tasks but , in spite of that , and even with a depression on hand , the death rate due to pellagra was cut about onethird in a very short time . If human food habits can be slightly changed pellagra is on its way to extinction . The good of Goldberger was not interred with his bones . For a time the G-battle centered exclusively about pellagra and it was not safe to mention this vitamin unless you were willing to take sides . Even though the complete tale of this disease has not been told , it is gradually fading into the background just as scurvy has faded , for it has been amply demonstrated that a reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diligent and prying efforts of the health workers and its incidence in America has passed over the peak and started down the long slide to oblivion . Vitamin G still remains , however , and workers in this field have gone back to the original idea ? that it is a necessary factor for the support of normal growth in animals . Its existence was first surmised in 1920 when it was found that there was something in yeast which would withstand higher temperatures than would vitamin B and which was needed for the normal growth of rats . The material was first known as vitamin B2 ( English usage ) because it was associated with ordinary vitamin B , being water-soluble like  | B , and occurring in the same foods . It was called PP ( pellagra preventive ) by Goldberger , but it gradually acquired complete independence in biological circles and was called G by American workers , a monument to Goldberger . Its function is not precisely fixed , but it undoubtedly has something to do with the assimilation of the principal constituents of food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is any prolonged shortage " digestive disturbances , nervous depression ( different from the symmetrical polyneuritis of vitamin B deficiency ) , general weakness and deterioration of tone , and an unhealthy ( or unthrifty ) condition of the skin are apt to develop ; the incidence of infectious disease seems likely to be increased , vitality diminished , life shortened , and the prime of life curtailed by the early onset of senility . " Vitamin G is fairly widespread in nature : apparently it is most plentiful in yeast and it is also quite abundant in wheat germ . ( N. B. It is practically non-existent in white bread and refined cereals . ) There is a bountiful supply in milk and eggs , some in muscle meat and a liberal amount in liver . The fleshy parts of fruits , roots and tubers usually contain a certain amount , but the leafy parts of plants contain more . As is the case with every other vitamin , a varied diet such as the human race was reared on , which represents a fair cross-section of all types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiency for normal nutrition . This vitamin has been isolated as a pure compound and identified as belonging to the group of substances known as " flavins . " It will probably eventually become a stock synthetic chemical purchasable at any drugstore , if such a step proves economically justified . Just as vitamins B and G were once thought to be one because of their close association , so does the naturally occurring G appear to be a complex . The new part is currently called vitamin H but it has n't been completely cor- nered yet . Perhaps there are even more constituents . There is good indication that B may be a complex of three or four different materials . The functions of the vitamins can be well summarized by citing the case history of a single group ? the inhabitants of an isolated part of Labrador who had been contaminated by white man 's food . The year 's food supply was bought all at one time so it was a relatively simple matter to determine what they ate . A thorough study has been made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet , principally cereals , giving an undesirably high percentage of carbohydrate , insufficient and incomplete proteins and a partial vitamin deficiency . In the summer months there were some wild berries . The diet was also supplemented part of the time with molasses and condensed milk . The growth of the children was noticeably retarded . There was a high incidence of deficiency diseases . In the winter months , after fresh food had been lacking for some time , the community showed a general nervous instability . By March it was quite pronounced . Psychoses and insanity became frequent . Most of the patients recovered completely when given a vitaminrich diet . Night blindness became common during April . A few cases of beriberi , edema , xerophthalmia , scurvy and pellagra were seen in May . These conditions were perfect indicators of the shortage of vitamins A , B , C and G. The natives had their own curative methods which had come down from primitive times as age-old traditions . Spruce beer made from young spruce tips was a popular beverage . It was considered a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old belief that raw bird 's liver cured night blindness . That was a tradition but it was more than that ? it was a truth . The curative agent in the liver , of course , was vitamin A. Communities such as this are perfect laboratories for the study of cause and effect in the field of vitamin deficiency .  | VITAMINS IN THE NATURE-PUZZLE The vitamins described in the preceding sections are all required by man . They are not merely convenient ? something handy to have around ? they are ( with the possible exception of vitamin E ) essential and the penalty for total omission of any one is death with a greal deal of discomfort on the way . The penalties for only partially fulfilling the requirements range from slight maladies to serious ill-health . Let no one suppose that he is such a hardy soul that he can do without his vitamins . It just is n't done ? not in this life . Fortunately for us almost all foods , except granulated sugar , have at least some vitamin content . If these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have survived . On the other hand if these substances had not been widely spread throughout the edible portions of the plant and animal kingdoms , we certainly would never have evolved a digestive system which depended on their presence in food . As long as we keep the diet within the range of composition of the natural foods on which the race was evolved we are reasonably sure to be fulfilling the basic requirements . We should hate to admit that we can not improve on the prehistoric menu , but as soon as we step beyond the broad limits of diet set up by our anthropoid ancestors we are laying ourselves open to possible deficiencies . This is not a matter of tradition or personal choice ? it involves the whole pattern of evolution . This philosophizing on the vitamins should appeal particularly to those who like to see universal patterns in nature , for here is a most convenient co-operative arrangement which makes one species of life nutritionally dependent on another . When sufficient knowledge is at hand to enable the student of the biological sciences to approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vitamins from one group of scientists while another group bombards him with information about the hormones or secretions of the animal  | ductless gland , a third group about growth-promoting substances ? such as the auxins ? in plants , and still another group about the self-generating compounds such as the bios of yeast ? necessary for the growth of microorganisms . He will study from a broad viewpoint the chemistry and physics of the groups of interrelated compounds which , in some way as yet unexplained , control the life processes . There is a great similarity between the workings of all of these classes of compounds . The vitamins probably act as hormones in plants and then are passed on to the animals to perform a different , though perhaps analogous , function of control . Hopkins considers vitamins to be exogenous hormones . The vitamins and hormones might also be considered analogous to the auxins , which are the growth-promoters necessary for plants . All activities of living matter seem to be subject to the regulatory action of minute concentrations of highly complicated chemical compounds . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting ground for studying the principles of synthesis and action of all of these growth-controlling substances . Nature played us a troublesome trick when she allowed us to evolve without the ability to make all our own regulatory materials . We are the most helpless of living things . Almost everything has to come to us ready to use . We have little ability to synthesize amino acids to make our own muscles . We have to be fed complete proteins which contain all the necessary amino acids . We have to be supplied with our vitamins all prepared or nearly so ? or we die . Yet the more lowly plants manufacture these things we must have . Even some animals can make a few of these substances . Birds can make their own vitamin C if none is fed to them . So can rats . Cows put vitamin C into their milk even when their rations are totally devoid of it . But human bodies , with the possible exception of the very young , apparently do not manufacture so much as a molecule of this vital crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be tied up in some way with the growing-processes of the plant world . When seeds sprout they begin producing vitamin C. On his first Antarctic expedition in 1928 Commander Byrd kept some dried seed beans in reserve , to be sprouted to provide vitamin C if his men showed any signs of scurvy . The diet was so well planned , however , that neither scurvy nor any other dietary deficiency appeared . That was a landmark in exploration . Whether vitamin C is merely an incidental by-product of the sprouting process or whether the substance plays some essential part in promoting subsequent growth of the plant no one knows , but its universality makes it probable that it does fulfill some useful purpose . It serves the plant , then we eat the plant and the vitamin is used over again . Vitamin D is necessary in some way for the formation of those tougher parts of the body ? the bones and teeth . Plants have no bones and hence have no need for and do not manufacture vitamin D. When we need vitamin D we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bones and hence need vitamin D. Apparently they manufacture it themselves and then store it in the catch-all ? the liver , though how they do it is a question . Hence the efficacy of cod liver oil in supplying this important whiff of life . Though the first vitamin thought of by plants while germinating and sprouting seems to be C , when it really gets down to the business of growing the plant needs some help . That help seems to come from traces of the compounds called the carotenes which it manufactures . Carotene is called a " precursor " of vitamin A , for our own and other animal bodies make the vitamin out of it . We are completely ignorant of the exact function carotene plays in plant life but it does seem to be associated with the chlorophyll which is the material promoting the photosynthesis whereby plants grow . No chlorophyll ? no vitamin A. Mushrooms obtain life predigested and second hand ; they live off partially decayed  | plant or animal matter , therefore they need to perform no acts of photosynthesis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , though they do contain small amounts of B and G. In this they are related to yeast , which is a fermentative material and hence , in one sense , also a parasite . These two vitamins , B and G , may be necessary for the growth of yeast and of mushrooms and they probably play some important role in the life-story of yeast . They are not confined to parasitic growth but are so widespread in the realm of growing plants , the leaves , fruits and tubers , that it seems that they , too , are part of whatever it is that makes plants grow . B , the first of the pair , probably is very important in the storage process whereby plants lay up calories in the fall for the seedling in the spring . The germ of the cereal seeds ( particularly wheat ) is nearly always high in B , ( white flour and most refined cereals have none ) . Plants store vitamin E , too , so it must have something to do with plant as well as animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it a provision of nature until we know more about it . Every meal we eat , if it is a proper meal , is filled with examples of multiple uses of foodstuffs , passing from one living organism to another . Every hour of our parasitic lives demands the proteins , mineral compounds and vitamins which some plant may have manufactured for its own perpetuation , only to have them consumed by an animal , which may itself be eaten by man . This idea is more crudely but effectively expressed by the agricultural nugget , " we feed corn to the cow , it goes through the cow and the hog eats it , it goes through the hog and the chicken eats it , and then we eat the chicken . " If you do n't believe that you 've never observed animal life on a farm . The moral of this discussion ( if you must have a moral ) is that we have evolved into creatures that require a large  | number of obscure chemical compounds in small quantities . We ca n't help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living was laid down a million years ago and we have to follow those specifications . In order to survive we must do what our grunting ancestors did ? eat almost anything that is digestible and more important , eat all of it , or nearly all ; even chew the bones . Do n't trifle with nature by the introduction of purity ? it wo n't work , until we have learned all about the whole multitude of substances which must be fitted together in the complex puzzle of life .  | JACKSTRAWS JACKSTRAWS ( modern variant ? Pick Up Stix ) is a game wherein a few dozen sticks are thrown into a mass on a table to be picked up individually without disturbing any of the others . Human life is a conglomerate pile of thousands of chemical compounds made from some three dozen different elements . The materials are assembled with such mutual entanglement that the removal or disturbance of one most certainly leads to a disturbance of some of the others . If life were made up of some few thousand substances laid in a row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understanding it might be a relatively simple matter . But when the materials intertwine into a mechanism of such extremely complicated function that jiggling in one part causes severe maladjustments somewhere else in the pile , the tracing of cause and effect becomes a Gordian knot . No one has yet unsnarled the riddle of the simplest life : perhaps no one ever will ? though the theologians must not count on that . The uncertainty of results leads one to hesitate to experiment with the affairs of life , for there is nothing the average individual abhors as much as uncertainty . The man in the death house gets used to the idea of being hanged , but waiting for the decision of the jury makes a nervous wreck of him . This element of uncertainty in biological phenomena has been the chief barrier to progress in gaining an understanding of the animal body . It so obscures the relations between cause and effect that only the keener and less  | prejudiced minds can ascertain the connecting thread . Medics , biologists , botanists , zoologists in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental phenomena simply because they could not or would not make the mental effort to view nature on a broad basis and relate effects to an obscure but fundamental cause involving the whole organism . The same thing is probably true of most of the routine biological researchers today , although the broad view is certainly much more common than it once was . This lack of breadth of the biological mind , coupled with unwillingness to bid good-bye to certain prejudices , is what lengthened the fight for the acceptance of evolution to a fifty-year struggle and postponed for a full generation the wide utilization of Pasteur 's findings on the relation between germs and diseases . If 100 persons were exposed to typhoid germs and only 50 took the disease , the one-track mind said that the germs could not have been the cause because there were 5o who escaped . It takes more subtle reasoning than most people care to indulge in to attach significance to less than 100 per cent correlation between cause and effect . Because all the men on poor diet did not always get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that scurvy is caused by inadequate diet . After years of battling it is now generally conceded that there is many a barrier between the germ or the dietary deficiency and the sick-bed , and a given cause is by no means certain to produce a given result . There is only a certain probability that it will do so . After all , we are human beings , and that means a certain degree of individuality . Just when the biological world was getting well-grounded in the idea that a single cause may have many effects ( and was waiting for the public to catch up with that concept ) the reverse difficulty began to become prominent ? it is often necessary to have a number of simultaneous causes to produce a given effect . That makes it more difficult than ever to unscramble the puzzle , and calls for uncommonly keen  | thinking . It is now fairly well established that at least two germicidal agencies ( both filterable viruses ) are involved in producing the common cold . Nothing helpful has been done about it yet but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right direction . The fact that in a given deficiency disease there is infection as well as the lack of a dietary factor complicates the picture and bemuddles the understanding . The complexity does not stop here , however . Hardly any of the deficiency conditions are entirely due to the lack of a single factor . Scurvy seems to be about the only deficiency disease that ever occurs in animals uncomplicated by other conditions . Moreover , the body tends to protect itself against a given deficiency by some shift of its functions . In the case of the secretions of the ductless glands one gland tends to help another that is ailing . But no amount of patchwork can take the place of a properly constructed organism . The body is made of the food we eat . Its proper construction depends first on obtaining the proper raw materials . The existing knowledge of the necessary building stones has been outlined . Every new one that has been discovered has been found to be tied by lifestrings to other parts of the structure . The one universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole storehouse of materials , and every one of them helps the other ones do their duty . The carbohydrates , fats , proteins , minerals and vitamins can not effectively be considered separately , they only exist and work together . The chapters which follow take up the question of nutrition in connection with certain specific problems of health . No one of these problems is the result of a single factor , but each is the effect of a variety of causes , a complex of many intertangled threads . We can not , then , hope to define the exact role of food in relation to teeth , mental efficiency , stamina ; all we can hope to do is to establish certain general connections , certain ways in which the food we eat contributes to our well-being or our ill-health .  | DECAYING TEETH THROUGH THE AGES UT a man 's tooth in a dry cave or gravel bank and it will remain intact for a million years ? at least . Leave it in his head and it often decays within a year . Poor teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these mouths of ours . One of the most discouraging items of our existence is to come face to face with the realization that in one of life 's most essential departments we have not been able , in spite of fastidious attention and professional care , to turn in as good a performance as did primitive man . It is the same kind of insult as having a Hottentot as chess champion of the world . We have lapsed into a sort of religious lethargy where bad teeth are classified as an act of God along with senility and labor pains at childbirth . Of course there is a ritual to pacify the evil spirit . One must brush his teeth twice a day , visit his dentist with a smile twice a year and abhor pink toothbrush . But what are dentrifice manufacturers doing to make the use of their product unnecessary ? Nothing . What is the average dentist doing to make dentists as unnecessary as they were among primitive men ? Naturally , almost nothing . There is no shortage of explanations for bad teeth : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of the bacillus acidophilus in the mouth , which promptly eats away the enamel ; because we drink hot liquids and eat hot foods ( perhaps the heat melts the enamel ) ; because our modern food is so soft that we do not use our teeth enough ; because we did not choose our grandfathers  | correctly ( the geneticist can pin everything on to heredity ) ; because we do not receive professional dental service often enough ; because we do not use sufficient quantities of the world 's greatest and most advertised tooth paste ; because the acid-base balance is upset . These things are recited so often that they must be true , but here is something else that is indisputably true : most present-day truly primitive people have teeth that are relatively near perfect , but they have no dentists , no toothbrushes , no tooth paste . Their mouths are , to put it as delicately as possible , filthy . Their food may or may not be rough but they gulp it with the greatest possible rapidity . They know no dental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of people that one invites to dinner , but their mouths have something to say that should be worth hearing . The teeth of savages have so invariably gone to hell whenever they have substituted the white man 's diet for their own that , eugenists to the contrary , one is forced to the conclusion that primitive oral superiority is due not to heredity but to diet . It might be true that a clean tooth never decays but no tooth is clean for long . A poorly constituted tooth decays in spite of the best of care and a good tooth will not decay despite the worst of care . What makes teeth that are proof against decay ? A diet that is adequate in elements calcium and phosphorus , in vitamins A , C and D , and in those minerals necessary for the functioning of the ductless glands . The proper performance of the parathyroid seems to be particularly important in the case of teeth . As far as research and clinical observations go , it is as simple as that . The exponents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't answer it . We do n't inherit teeth , we grow them . One might say that about every part of the body , but it is particularly true of teeth because they are the end-products of the reactions of a great many body mechanisms . Evidence , such as it is , points to the possibility of " inheriting " an unusually  | good digestive and endocrine system which is more efficient than the average in assimilating tooth- and bone-building materials , but if the diet is entirely inadequate the best digestive system in the world will not maintain sound teeth . Adequate diet from the beginning of prenatal life on does , on the average , produce sound teeth . Heredity in this matter is only secondary . These may appear to be rather presumptuous statements , considering the general lack of their acceptance not only by the public at large but by many of the members of the dental and medical professions . But the refusal to accept obvious scientific facts is by no means rare in the history of the acquisition of knowledge . Tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human race . The exact mechanism of tooth decay is not known , neither are the processes of building teeth understood . It will be an added blessing to dental health when these secrets are brought from hiding , but it is not necessary to know all the answers to interpret the broad results of thousands of dental investigations . One of the reasons for the long delay in spotting the underlying cause of poor teeth was that it lay buried in the prenatal life of the human being . The feeding of the fetus has a great deal of bearing upon the dental history of subsequent adult life . The calcification ( formation ) of the baby teeth begins between the fourth and fifth months of pregnancy . The calcification of the first permanent teeth is active during the last three months of pregnancy . The permanent teeth are forming rapidly during the first year of the baby 's exterior life and calcification continues throughout all the years of growth , at least as far as the eighteenth year . If the prenatal diet does not contain enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teeth of calcium and phosphorus to build structures of its own . But even  | though the mother suffers through the weakening of bones and the decaying of teeth , the infant still does not acquire enough of the building material necessary to make really adequate teeth . Since there is still considerable time after the infant is born before the teeth come out into this putrefactive world , it would seem that calcium , phosphorus and vitamin deficiencies could be made up then to give sound teeth , whatever might have been the prenatal nutrition . It should be that way but it is n't . All experiments on human and other animals point to the inescapable fact that inadequate prenatal nutrition almost always results in poor teeth for the child , no matter how good the diet may be after birth . It was the pediatricians who first began professionally to emphasize the importance of diet in the formation of children 's teeth . Under their influence health campaigns in schools are now saying less than they once did about such superficialities as the toothbrush , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods . This is n't the radical opinion of a few ; it is , and has been for some time , the firm conviction of most pediatricians . Even in the early 192o 's , which , medically , was a long time ago , one of the most conservative and prominent of children 's doctors , Dr. E. A. Parks , sounded the keynote of the relation between teeth and rickets , to which very little can be added by even the most enthusiastic theorist : " Personally , I believe that if pregnant women received ample well-balanced diets , in which green vegetables were abundantly supplied and cows ' milk was regularly taken , and they were kept a sufficient part of their time in the open air and sun , and their infants were placed in the direct rays of the sun for a part of each day and were fed cod liver oil for the first two or three years of life , more could be accomplished in regard to the eradication of caries of the teeth than in all other ways put together and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Important as prenatal and infant nutrition is to dental health , it is not by any means the only factor . A child who starts life with poor teeth can improve them , or at least keep from growing worse , by eating proper food . Conversely , a set of excellent teeth can be ruined in a few years or even less if the diet is deficient in the necessary minerals and vitamins . Whatever the advantages of life in America , they certainly do not extend to teeth . When schools and departments of health began to clutter up the high functions of education with routine health examinations they gathered some of the most damning statistics ever put on civilization 's books . In 1920 the New York Dental Inspector found that : " Ninety per cent of the children in the first grades , not only in the slums but in aristocratic and best sections , have bad teeth ; one third have abscessed conditions in their mouths and every fourth or fifth child does not have proper masticating surfaces . Of the little tots in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the sixth year molar decayed ? a tooth which has not been in the mouth more than one year and yet the first molar of the permanent set , decayed . " Dr. H. D. Cross who found 96 per cent of a large sample of American children with teeth below par also found that 96 per cent of the children immigrating to this country from southern Europe had perfectly sound teeth . Moreover ? and we should really be proud of this accomplishment ? after the foreign children had lived in this country for a while their teeth , too , began to deteriorate . These data are typical of those from all over the country . A survey of Gary , Indiana , school children showed that 83 per cent had one or more decayed teeth . Even Florida , the land drenched with sunshine and dedicated to healthful outdoor life , reveals that almost 5o per cent of its schoolchildren have decayed teeth . It is generally believed that about half the Englishmen over forty have false teeth . If you think that all this is normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that among most primitive peoples , living on primitive foods , a decayed tooth is a rarity , but as soon as they adopt the foods of civilization their teeth begin to decay . The important leavings of the ancient Egyptians were not the pyramids or sphinxes but the mummies . They left their well-wrapped and preserved bodies as bids for immortality and after a fashion they are acquiring it , for from the long-dead mummies we are reconstructing the living picture of 2,000 to 6,000 years ago . Some mummies , of course , missed their destiny ? they were used for boiler fuel on Nile steamers ? but a great many have ended up as honored museum pieces , worthy objects of study . The marvelous keeping qualities of the Egyptian climate ( not any lost secret of embalming ) have preserved not only the bones but often skin and flesh and the stomach and intestinal contents , which give unmistakable records of the last meals of past millennia . The teeth are there , too , to say their word . The record is unmistakable . Around 4000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As civilization advanced the teeth went downhill until the beginning of the Coptic Christian era when the skulls of the aristocracy presented the world 's greatest exhibit of the worst possible teeth . But there were class divisions : those who lived luxuriously suffered most . There are those who contend that bad teeth have usually come in with the widespread use of cereals , yet the Egyptians kept themselves decay-resistant with a diet which was preponderantly made up of cereal grains ? as far back as we have any intestinal contents , which is to say about 6,000 years ago . There were fish , too , in no small quantities . The early barley and millet were gradually supplemented with the great variety of things that an aggressive and advanced agricultural community can produce . For animal foods , evidenced from intestinal or burial remains and in some cases written records , there were : ox , sheep , goat , stag , pig ( rare  | except at ceremonies ) , gazelle , ibex , wild goat , hyena , goose , duck , grouse , teal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many kinds of fish ( dried fish was the cheapest food of the land ) . Milk was used at an early date . Fruits and vegetables were figs , dates , olives , grapes , currants , beans , peas , radishes , leeks , garlic , cucumbers , apricots , melons , onions , avocados , pomegranates , almonds , cherries , mulberries , peaches , endive , lettuce , sugar-cane , cabbage , vetch , colocasia ( a water lily ) . The water lilies were used for food , the dry pounded seeds for bread and the root eaten as it was . Lentil porridge was one of the chief articles of food of the poor . Modern agriculture has n't much more to offer . Almost everything is there except corn , tobacco , sweet potatoes and vanilla , which almost represent the Americas ' entire contribution to the food of the world . Yet whatever the diet , the poor enjoyed good dental health while the well-found upper-crusters began to find their teeth full of holes . From an Ancient Empire cemetery at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 skeletons of aristocrats of the time of the Pyramid builders ( best guess 3700 to 3000 B.C. ) . These skeletons showed " tartar formation , dental caries ( decay ) and alveolar abscesses as common as in modern Europe . At every subsequent period of Egyptian history one finds the same thing ? the wide prevalence of every form of dental disease among the wealthy people of luxurious diet ; and the relative immunity from it among the poorer people who live mainly on a coarse uncooked vegetable diet . " But the poor had their tooth trouble even if it was n't decay . It was mechanical wear due to abrasive action . The grains were fairly abrasive to begin with and they were ground on stone surfaces which contributed a bit to each loaf of bread . The teeth wore down very rapidly . The wear was so severe that in later life there were many abscesses in the sockets even though there were few if any caries ( decay in the main body of the tooth ) . The same condition of rapid  | mechanical wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cases where stones are still used for the grinding of meal and flour . This sort of mechanical wear is common among herbivorous animals such as horses and cows . Dry grasses alone are abrasive enough to wear teeth down rapidly . In addition there is always a certain amount of sand and dirt clinging to the particles . Aged animals often have their teeth worn down until they become entirely useless . Man on very rough food suffers a similar or worse fate , for he lives longer than the other animals . If the Egyptian took the food as nature gave it to him , with no refining except grinding , he wore down his teeth until they were very short . If he had sufficient means to pay for such refined and purified foods as were then available his teeth rotted away . Life was not too kind to these Egyptians whom we have to thank for giving us some evidence on the cause of dental decay . White men are usually regarded in a poor light by primitive peoples ? at least by those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . White man may come out on top but he does it in spite of his obvious inferiority ? by trickery , chicanery and underhand methods . Our standing among the pure-blood Indians and the Eskimos is notoriously low . We are a great large laugh to the Eskimo , who can take a joke , but we are , or were , a disgusting spectacle to the Indian . From the earliest days the American Indian made note of our poor teeth . One 's teeth might be broken off , knocked out , worn down with use , filthy and unsightly , but if they decayed it was a sign of lack of moral fiber . The Sioux said that White Man 's teeth were rotten because innumerable lies went out over them . The erosive influence of deception may be considerable , but it takes more than that to explain a decayed molar . On the average these first families of America did very well by their teeth , though there were some poor performers .  | Since Indian skulls are almost as common as arrowheads there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over prehistoric teeth . There have been several such investigations . One tribe did have such really poor teeth that we can almost approach them as kindred spirits . The Zunis of the Southwest achieved a record among the Indians ? 75 per cent of the skulls found showed decayed teeth . These were pre-Columbian skeletons , free of all contamination with white man . The diet was largely vegetarian , chiefly cereal , with emphasis on corn or maize . Pumpkins and beans were used to a certain extent . When luck was good there were deer , rabbits or turkeys , but meat was an item not to be counted on . High cereal content of diet ? mediocre teeth , that thread runs through most nutritional history . Some of the Algonquins lived in Kentucky , the region where " D. Boone cilled a bar " whenever he was so minded . This heavily forested and fertile region , the pride of the blue-grassers , encouraged a sedentary way of life but furnished substantial quantities of meat . Game was plentiful and the river flats and small forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a small scale , was effective . The vegetable part of the early Algonquin menu consisted of corn , squash , beans , wild fruits and nuts . There were plenty of bear , deer and smaller animals to go around . Fishing , too , brought results in those days . The diet was a nearly ideal mixture of meats and vegetables undamaged by the dangerous hand of purification . The teeth were good , though not record breakers . About 30 per cent of the skulls of all ages have shown dental decay and nearly all of the adult skulls show severe mechanical wear . In Wisconsin there were several tribes of Indians . It could hardly be said that they lived peacefully together for they occasionally bashed in each other 's heads , but there were no significant sociological variations between them . They were all at about the same cultural level and had the same char- acter of diet . They lived in more or less permanent villages . The squaws tended the ground and the papooses , the braves and other males hunted , fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians were : corn , rice , beans and squash , besides the great variety of seeds , roots , nuts and berries which they found in the woods of Wisconsin . When luck was with them , fish and flesh were plentiful . The skulls of these woods Indians all tell the same story . Adult teeth were badly worn from general wear and tear in the struggle with rough foods , but only about 25 per cent showed decay ( caries ) . ( Almost loo per cent of white men show decayed teeth . ) The Arikara inhabited the upper Missouri Valley . Their vigorous hunting neighbors looked down upon them , calling them the corn-eaters . ' They too had the usual beans and squash but less of the wild woods products than the more easterly tribes . In the winter there was buffalo-huntingwith results . There were fish at that time even in the Missouri . Theirs was a good mixed diet . The skulls show that 25 to 30 per cent of them had one or more decayed teeth before disease or the Sioux got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to read about and that the U. S. Army used to hate to see . They were the ones who brought Custer to his last stand and were least attracted by the advantages of civilization . They were never stay-at-homes who remained in villages to putrefy in their own filth . They moved on to follow the buffalo , leaving their filth behind them . They were essentially carnivorous . They developed severe vegetable hunger but the Great Plains do not produce many vegetables . The squaws now and then did manage to raise a bit of corn on a river flat but it was an uncertain supply ; the group was continually moving on and did not always get back to harvest the nubbins . But investigation shows that other items ? the falcata bean , for example ? were held in higher esteem than corn .  | The Sioux always cleaned out the carefully cached winter supply of this bean which the meadow mice had stored away ( about a pint per mouse ) in underground holes ; believing in a fair swap he might be back next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange . On the whole , however , the Sioux was a meat-eater and a bone-gnawer and his teeth were superb . The percentage of decayed teeth in the precivilized skulls was almost zero . As soon as the white man really began his beneficial work the noble red man became lo ! the poor Indian . The change came about with the advent of the reservation and the trading post . A thorough and damning investigation of the Pine Ridge Sioux Reservation of South Dakota was carried out in 1928 . The food available on the reservation consisted of muscle cuts of meat ( poorest quality ) , a certain amount of milled cereals , bread , sugar and coffee . The Sioux still prefers meat when he can get it but if that fails he subsists on " grease bread " and coffee . There was a great prevalence of tooth decay , bow legs , sore eyes and blindness . Eighty-five percent of the deaths were from tuberculosis or other respiratory diseases . One-third of all the child deaths occurred in a relatively few families where the diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The change has been wrought in two and , in some cases , one generation . The primitive races which have the best teeth are usually those of carnivorous habits ; they live on an all-meat menu . " All meat " really means what it says . In eating an animal they work from the inside out . The blood comes first in demand , then the vital organs . The bones are gnawed , and the fat is eaten . If the food supply is low they condescend to eat the finer muscle meat , the sirloins and porterhouses , but ordinarily they throw some of the prime cuts ( white man 's opinion ) to the dogs . When fish are available the smaller ones are dried whole , and are eaten the same way . Among the Eskimos there is a great deal of jaw exercise ,  | though they are by no means Fletcherizers . They prefer whenever possible to gulp the morsel as soon as it will go down . But the Eskimo finds the tougher parts nutritionally preferable to the tender . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it requires considerable jaw effort to eat really frozen meat and to gnaw bones . If there is a wooden peg to be pulled or pieces of rawhide to be drawn into place , the teeth are used in lieu of pliers . The average Eskimo man or woman following the aboriginal pattern of life has broad and magnificent jaws . The teeth are large , uncrowded , and usually in perfect alignment . This excellence is not a matter of heredity but of diet and dietary habits . Measurements of casts of teeth of Eskimo children reared at trading posts on canned and conventionally preserved foods show the narrow , crowded jaw characteristic of the white man . The organism , as in so many other cases , adapts itself to the use to which it is put . Use the jaw and it develops ; leave it alone and it finds no reason to develop . Moral : give children foods which require chewing ? or even chewing gum . As to decay , there is none among Eskimos as long as the diet is native . But Eskimo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that a sack of candy will buy a pile of very fine furs . Eskimo children now living in settlements where they have more or less free access to the candy supply have some of the worst teeth in the world . The decay is not only pitiful but devastating ? one more piece of evidence that the sudden imposition of civilization upon a primitive people never brings any real benefit to them . These swan songs of primitive teeth would seem to indicate that , the more meat in the diet , and the less cereal and sugar , the better the teeth . But one should not draw hasty conclusions . He may be fairly sure that the higher the civilization the poorer the teeth will be , but he ca n't be as certain about the beneficial effects of meat . Aboriginal  | Hawaiian teeth and those of all the South Sea Islanders which have been studied were found to be good . There were fish , pigs , dogs and cocoanuts in the diet , but the mainstays were carbohydrates : taro , poi , yams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults a relatively low proportion , and only 2$ per cent or so of all the oldsters were afflicted . Theoretically , one of the worst diets in the world was that of our Southern Negro in slave days . It consisted , according to tradition and the meager records of the period , of sow belly , co'n pone and ' lasses . Yet whatever may have been the physical shortcomings of the Negro slave , his teeth were traditionally and indisputably excellent . Such observations of the good teeth of peoples living on diets high in carbohydrate led to another line of attack in the investigation of the effect of diet on teeth . Martha R. Jones , who has done a comprehensive piece of work in revealing the cause of certain dental idiosyncrasies , was born in a lily-bower . She was reared in a Southern family of the old school . She , with her sisters , was destined to go through finishing school , marry and become the unimpeachable and decorative Southern gentlewoman . Living in a district and in a family where refusal to conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such manner . Ill-health was the primary cause of her rebellion . Though apparently robust , she was known in the family to be sickly . Discharging ears were chronic , decaying teeth all too frequent . At the age of eight it was necessary to extract five of her most useful molars , because they were hopelessly decayed . She resented that and determined to find out why the natural world should so mistreat an innocent young woman . After high school she refused to go to finishing school and announced one fall morning that she was off to a college where one could learn something of the sciences . " When ? " her horrified family asked , hoping the foolish idea  | might wear off in time ; " Right now , " replied the determined Martha R. There was little or no money , but unlimited supplies of discouragement ; the result of her ultimatum was practically a downright battle . But in two hours she crawled out on top of the heap and was off ? to college . College over ( no one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and tried every means to induce her to stay home . But the family did n't know its daughter . In late summer she floored them beyond all hope of recovery by announcing that she had contrived to get a scholarship for graduate study and was on her way up No'th to get a Ph.D . under Yale 's great nutritionist , Lafayette B. Mendel . Her exodus was properly punctuated with family wails , but she strode steadily and gladly on to perdition and a thesis on " Carbohydrate Metabolism in Rabbits " in Yale 's Department of Physiological Chemistry . During the years 1917 ? 18  --  even though she had not yet received the graduate crown ? she ably pinch-hitted for two assistants of the laboratory , because of the shortage of men . After achieving her Ph.D . she convinced the Medical School of the University of California that they should make a place for her to investigate metabolism problems . They did . She experimented with rabbits and puppies . She found that on certain diets they had good bones but poor teeth . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always mean good teeth . But when puppies were fed a ration which was high in alkaline ash foods the teeth and bones both were excellent . Her experiments were numerous , her conclusions convincing . She presented her findings to a convention of America 's top-flight dentists in 1928 . The result was a chilling : " Interesting but not significant for human beings . " But Dr. Jones of the common name had uncommon courage . She would demonstrate the significance of her findings when applied to human beings . Hawaiians  | had once had excellent teeth . Working on white man 's plantations they had deserted native diet and their teeth had gone to rot . Hawaii , then , was a good place for her demonstration , and eventually she arrived at The Queen 's Hospital , Honolulu . She wanted to start a " health center " on a large plantation and lead the workers to better dietary habits . The director said " No ; the idea is too visionary . " Shortly afterward he started on a trip around the world . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her health center on the Ewa plantation ? with no funds . The center succeeded even after the director returned , and within two years Dr. Jones amply demonstrated that a return to the general foodstuffs of the native Hawaiian diets greatly improved not only dental but general health as well , especially among the infants . Bernard Shaw was one of her distinguished visitors . He went home and beat the drum for courageous Dr. Jones as one of the world 's finest . Some months later the struggling lady received a letter from England addressed " To the Lady in Charge of the Health Clinic , Hawaii . " The letter requested , " Please tell me how to grow a new set of teeth . I need them . " Dr. Jones is as yet hardly up to that , but she is on her way to telling the world how to save the ones it has . Following the successful Hawaii demonstration she has been assigned to work with a medical officer of the U. S. Navy to study the relation between diet and dental decay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that , other things being equal , teeth will be good if the percentage of foods which form alkaline ash is substantially higher than those which form acid ash . Her colleagues in similar lines of work agree with the efficacy of her recommended diets of natural foods in prevention of tooth decay , but they do not agree with her explanation . Acid-base equilibrium seems to them to be unimportant ; the mineral and vitamin content of the diet is ,  | they think , the determining factor . The explanation , however , is incidental ; it is the results which are important . One of the great investigations of human teeth was conducted by Drs . May and Edward Mellanby . In 1918 Edward , professor of pharmacology at the University of Sheffield , began an extended study of rickets which led to the work with his wife on teeth . Being English probably gave them the impetus , because English teeth are even worse than American . After a few years May continued more or less alone to search in laboratory and clinic for the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A and D. The results of her extensive investigation may be presented briefly : the principal barrier to good teeth in dogs or in man is lack of vitamin D. If the diet is reasonably adequate in other respects , ample vitamin D from the beginning of prenatal life on , practically gives assurance of sound teeth . A diet adequate in all other respects but low in vitamin D will probably result in poor teeth . The function of vitamin D is not exactly known , but it is evident that it has something to do with the assimilation of the calcium and phosphorus from the diet and their inculcation into the proper structure of the teeth . There are certain foods which seem to inhibit the calcifying action for the formation of proper teeth . These foods are cereals and cereal products , the worst offender being oatmeal . These are " seed " products and it has been repeatedly shown with animal experimentation that it requires the whole plant , both " seed " and " leaf , " to give adequate nutrition . Another explanation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assimilation of phosphorus from cereals . This element occurs in them chiefly as inositol hexosphosphate , which is not only poorly absorbed but which also precipitates calcium and thus prevents its absorption .  | It takes an extra dosage of vitamin D or of sunshine to overcome this deleterious effect . Dr. Mellanby 's conclusion that the modern diet should contain more fruits , vegetables , milk and less cereals , undoubtedly is correct and cod liver oil , more than ever , is holding its place in civilization . Impressive as the scope of the works of Drs . Jones and Mellanby has been they must take second place to that of Dr. Weston A. Price of Cleveland . Like Miss Jones he became interested in the maladies of teeth because of early illness . During the winter of 1893 , at the age of 21 , he was practicing dentistry at Grand Forks , North Dakota , when he had a severe attack of typhoid fever and almost made a speaking acquaintance with death . When he finally came to the point of convalescence he went to his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fish , cream and milk . He was astonished to find that his teeth , which had been decaying at an alarming rate ever since the beginning of his illness , stopped their downward career . This convinced him that tooth decay is a matter of diet . When his health was fully regained he went into dental practice in Cleveland with this idea as the background for his work and he has been tracking down this theory ever since . He has made a specialty of investigating the teeth and diet of primitive peoples both before and after contact with white man 's foods . Instead of taking vacations he and his wife go expeditioning in Central Africa or among the Alaskan Eskimos , studying teeth , bone malformations and diet . His publications on the subject run into the dozens . His findings , in general , have all been the same ? the average white man 's diet is bad for the teeth . In the course of one of their typical investigations they went into districts of Canada and Alaska where the Indians had never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22,000 teeth . In the primitive Indian group only o.16 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by decay . In a group of  | Indians whose racial stock was the same , but who had been contaminated with white man 's trading , he found 21.5 per cent of the teeth decayed . He carefully compared the respective diets and found that the fat-soluble vitamins had been greatly reduced by contact with civilization . He also found , in the civilized diet , the following percentage reduction of the essentials of nutriment : Calcium was reduced 83 per cent , phosphorus 83 per cent , iron 64 per cent , magnesium 76 per cent , copper 34. per cent , iodine 89 per cent . In Alaska , Canada , Hawaii , Melanesia , Polynesia , Kenya , Uganda , Belgian Congo , Sudan , Egypt , Africa , and the South Sea Islands the findings have all been similar . In some cases the contact with civilization has been much more devastating than was the case with the Canadian Indians . Dr. Price 's conclusion in the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of a single or even of a few factors . Not only calcium and phosphorus but many other minerals are necessary for proper teeth , and they must be fortified with a liberal intake of most if not all of the vitamins . His views of what are essential may be unnecessarily broad , but if one follows his suggestions dental health is almost certain to be good unless there is something decidedly wrong with the digestive system or the ductless glands . It must not be supposed that one must go back to primitive foods to get the necessary food elements . Civilized foods are more palatable and just as adequate if you will use the right ones . The Price specifications for adequate diet are as simple as this : the daily ration of the average individual should include one tomato and one orange or other citrus fruit , with a liberal helping of lettuce , celery , raw carrot or other raw vegetable such as cabbage . In addition he should have the tops and roots of vegetables , which may be cooked ; green peas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk , depending on the other foods used . It might be added that  | for those who are particularly susceptible to dental decay , an extra s-apply of vitamin D is still efficacious . Cod liver oil or vitamin D concentrate are essential features of civilization . Though the experimenting is by no means finished and no one knows the exact mechanism of tooth building or tooth decay , it seems certain that our decaying teeth occur primarily because of the excessive proportion of these articles in the average diet : lean muscle meat , refined cereals and refined sugar . It is not that these materials are themselves necessarily harmful , but that their excessive use prevents the partaking of the other foods which are essential for the best of health . There should be a larger proportion in our diet of dairy products , fruits , leafy vegetables and tubers and of the blood and vital organs of animals . Let the butcher , the baker and the candy-maker who vociferously protest these nutritional findings be warned that the evidence is voluminous and indisputable , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peanut can supply the physical energy for an hour of adult mental work . If the work is accompanied by worry , or is a particularly despicable task or an uncommonly exciting one , muscular tension may be increased and considerable energy may thus be consumed , but this worry , vexation or excitement is not a part of the mental work ? it is simply its concomitant . Unfortunately for mental masterpieces the rest of the body has to be nourished and nutritional deficits can make themselves felt in the brain as well as in the intestinal tract . There is no such thing as a specific brain food which can increase anyone 's mental stature above the level predetermined by the genes of one 's parents . Yet the quality and efficiency of the functioning of a mind most certainly partially depend upon the degree of excellence of the nutrition of the animal body . Fortunately for us , in our highly developed state , the nervous system bulks but lightly in the mass of the body ; it only weighs slightly over 2 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual must be made . It is a material object and requires certain chemical compounds for its structure . If these compounds are not present then the brain can not be constructed up to the plans of its genetic destiny . These compounds must be supplied by the diet . The fact that the nervous system is already in an advanced state when the human being is born does not change this requirement . The compounds have been taken from the mother 's body , hence were part of her diet .  | In the first few weeks of life a baby has a great deal of work to do on its nervous system . Part of the task is to build up the myelin sheaths of the nerves and this requires a certain amount of the sugar , galactose , which can only be formed in the mammary gland . It may be mere chance , but the milk of human beings has so to ioo per cent more galactose in it than does the milk of cows , and human beings usually have more brains than cows . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern baby 's formula the galactose per cent is further reduced . This may be another serious mistake of civilization . It might be expected , then , that infants short on galactose ? that is , infants fed on cows ' rather than on mothers ' milk ? might have mental equipment detectably below par . A test on 383 elementary school children showed that this theory is worthy of someone 's serious thought and investigation . The cow-nurtured infants had shown themselves more susceptible than did the mother-nurtured group to that collection of illnesses which makes childhood unpleasant . These are n't directly connected with brains , but walking and talking are certainly functions of the nervous system and the artificially-fed children were slower than the others in mastering those useful arts . The I. Q. 's ( Intelligence Quotients ) of the breast-feds averaged significantly higher than did those of the others . Anyone with a flair for close reasoning will concede that the above results may be true and proper but they do n't prove that the detectable ( though perhaps temporary ) inferiority of the artificially-fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this any fair-minded writer will concede to be true . The case against galactose deficiency is not proved , perhaps is not provable , but the result is the same whatever the explanation . There are a few nervous and mental disorders traceable to the lack of a specific substance . A lack of vitamin A causes experimental animals to develop a nervous disorder  | characterized by muscular weakness and in severe cases by partial paralysis . Children with vitamin A deficiency display a number of physiological symptoms ; they also invariably lose alertness and may be very lethargic even though the diet is adequate in other respects . It is not at all impossible that many a child is recorded on the books as " backward " when the entry really should be " deficient in vitamin A. " Most clear-cut and most easily prevented of the functional disturbances of the brain due to dietary deficiencies is that associated with the brand of goiter caused by a deficiency of iodine . Goiter in many cases has an appreciable , in some cases a marked , effect on mentality . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpletons effected by merely providing iodine in the diet . But such cases are relatively rare . It may not take much energy to keep the brain going , but it does require a reasonable supply of vitamins to keep the nervous system in condition to respond properly to stimuli . A properly nourished person is alert . The same individual if starving for some food constituent may be apathetic and impassive . A few vitamins have been known to work wonders . One or two instances will illustrate this fact . One of the leaders in the gathering and dispensing of the " newer knowledge of nutrition " is E. V. McCollum . Years of experimentation had shown him that animals may receive enough of the essential food elements to keep them above the deficiency disease level but still not enough to keep them in the best of health . If ample vitamins were furnished they immediately improved in growth rate , physical appearance and alertness . This should also apply to human beings , but one could not guess at that ; it had to be tried . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not malnourish or otherwise maltreat a human being or group of human beings for experimental purposes unless they make bona fide volun- teers of themselves , and even then it is risky business ? they might change their minds . But it is quite permissible to do the opposite . You can , with impunity , do something to an existing maltreated group if it is presumably going to improve them . Moreover you can ethically leave one part of the group maltreated for purposes of comparison and control . It has never been explained why it is more ethical to leave a maltreated group in that condition than it is to maltreat a group to begin with , but that seems to be the unwritten law and probably in some places the written one . McCollum found his experimental material in a Negro orphans ' home . The diet of the institution was adequate to preserve life and prevent serious deficiency diseases , but it was not of a quality to support abundant health . The food was particularly lacking in vitamins . Eighty-four children between the ages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group had no change in rations . The other half received a quart per day of whole milk prepared from Klim milk powder in place of some of the other food . The calorific input was the same in both groups , the substitution of milk was the only difference . The milk-fed group began running away with the weight chart , far outstripping their brothers and sisters on the unaltered diet . One child gained 90 per cent in weight in one year and a number of them increased 5o per cent . But that was n't all that happened . There were changes of temperament , too . The discipline of this institution was very strict , and before McCollum came the children were all apathetic , tractable and obedient . " Those in the milk-fed group .... soon caused annoyance to their teachers by their vitality and desire for activity . " The quart of milk per day seems to have been so much firewater to the nervous systems of the vitamin-starved pickaninnies . They began to get ideas and wanted to do things . Unquestionably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ' experiment was finished so  | the children could go back to the old peaceful , though not healthful , half-starved routine . The insinuation was that the institution did not have the money to continue the milk diet supplement after the experiment was completed . It must be remembered that these improvements in misbehavior under the better diet conditions indicated not only a change in physical activity but also an increase in mental activity and in initiative . This new activity was a condition of health , not one of malfunction , such as is evidenced by malnourished , irritable individuals who show spasmodic nervous activities . The modern dietetically-informed parent , of course , has grasped the idea that refractoriness of the colt is one of the circumstances attending adequate nutrition . He expects his properly nourished offspring to be full o ' hell and , behind his back , is sadly disappointed if he is n't . Vitamins are not the only things in life . There are other materials that may affect mental states . In earlier years there was much argument about proteins and carbohydrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted to a diet of eggs ( high protein ) for a few weeks . A monkey should n't mind that . In a short time the evidence showed that the bacterial flora of the intestine were of the putrefactive type . As the proteolytic or putrefactive types of bacteria began to predominate , which occurred promptly after restricting the monkeys to eggs , the animals became sleepy and rested their heads on their hands in a bowed position . They were stupid and responded slowly to external stimuli . They took their food very deliberately and manifested little interest in their surroundings . Obviously if they had been a psychologist 's monkeys their I. Q. 's would have taken a sharp drop . But when the little bacteria in the intestines were changed ? what a revolution in the monkey-mind ! " When the animals were changed to the milk ? glucose diet , both the  | psychical and physical attitudes underwent a great change . They no longer held their heads in their hands but assumed erect posture . They were alert and bright , and showed a keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food was consumed with more avidity . They no longer chewed the woodwork . " The last , you will admit , was very considerate of them . Moral : A certain amount of protein is essential , but too much is bad . In the pre-vitamin days the proteins supplied the jousting-ground for what few scientific nutritionists there were . They debated , experimented and tested to determine the quantity and quality of protein best suited for nutrition . Some experimenters showed that the human animal was physically and mentally benefited by going on a diet containing much less than the amount of protein generally considered the minimum necessary for health . Another type of enthusiast could get the same desirable results by putting a group on a relatively ( not excessively ) high protein diet . The battle ended in something that looked suspiciously like a tie and not much was proven except that the human body has an ability to adapt itself to conditions , within fairly wide limits . The low man in this game said only 82 per cent of the food should be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the absolute minimum required for prolonged maintenance of life . The high man suggested ( and with good experimental backing ) that i6 per cent of the calorific value of one 's food should be protein . Since the early days most nutritionists have become middle-of-the-roaders and recommend that the figure should be io to i 5 per cent . The average American diet contains 13 per cent . Not bad . The shift from the very-low-protein idea is largely because of its effect on rats . A rat which has its protein curtailed throughout its life never turns in a good record . It will be below average size , its energy will be below par , it will show less than usual signs of rat intelligence . If one has faith in  | rats and believes that they behave like human beings he will not pass by the cheeses , eggs and meats but will indulge in them , at least to a moderate degree . No one has ever taken one of a pair of identical twins and reared him on a protein-deficient diet while the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test were run and there were marked differences in intelligence quotients through the course of years it would almost be proven that low-protein diets had some relation to mentality . But no one will ever do that . Year-long tests have been run on volunteer groups of adults to determine effects of proteins on health , but the groups have not been large enough nor were the experiments long enough to be conclusive . Whole nations have existed and continue to exist on diets which contain barely enough protein to fulfill minimum needs . Such peoples are nearly always backward and apathetic . Is it because of deficient diet ? It may be ; at least there are some who think so . Philosophers at times have taken a hand in dietary arguments . Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach had some convictions on dietary matters . He was probably father of the statement that man is only what he eats ( Der Mensch ist was er isst ) though many have claimed parenthood . Philosopher Feuerbach felt very deeply about the failure of the Revolution of 1848 in Germany . His explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had resulted in a mental sluggishness responsible for the failure . " Potato blood , " he stormed , " can make no revolution ! " Should they then despair ? Was there no other food which could replace potatoes among the poorer classes and at the same time nurture them to manly vigor and disposition ? Yes , there was such a foodstuff , one which was the pledge of a better future , which contained the seed of a more thorough , even if more gradual revolution . This food was beans ( so said Feuerbach ) . Had Bismarck not thrown sociological sops to the yokels there might have been  | a later revolution with the successful insurgents bearing the banner displaying a red bean rampant on an azure field . More sound but less interesting are some British observations on the state of affairs amongst the Bengali . It seems that the poorer natives of Bengal have but little protein in the diet ( 8 per cent is the average ) and much of that is indigestible . Intelligence tests and scholastic performances show that these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that part of the world . There are good arguments to show that this is caused by the protein deficiency . Mental efficiency appears to depend not only on the quantity of protein you get , but on the kind as well . Every experienced nutritionist teaches that animal proteins ( cheese , milk , or eggs if you do n't care to eat dead animals ) are superior to vegetable proteins in utilizability ( biological value ) . This is a plain experimental fact . To prove its application to mental activity rats were again called on , the control group receiving an adequate diet including milk , the test group nothing but botanical matter . Obtaining the I. Q. ( or its rodent equivalent ) of rats is a simple matter . You turn the rat loose in a maze of passages and see how long it takes him to find his way out to some desirable objective ? food , perhaps . Then you see how many trials he must make before he can run the maze perfectly ? no mistakes . Amongst the rats , vegetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the females the different diets caused but little difference in mentality . But then the males had more opportunity to lose ground for the females were decidedly less intelligent than the males . There are those who contend that starving sharpens the wits , though they are seldom willing to try it themselves . No large group of human beings has ever been adequately tested to find the average effect of a dietary shortage on the mental powers , though there have been some qualitative  | observations of the mass effect of famine . Russian peasants , at least in times past , have been subjected to severe famine time and time again . They seem to have been able to meet the situation by developing the technique of hibernation : " Massed closely together on top of a wide stove , entire families of peasants , deprived practically of every means of subsistence , spend the dreary winter season in an almost uninterrupted sleep known in the famine visited districts by the name of liojka . ' Well protected against loss of heat by close contact as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frequently of entire villages remained , with occasional interruptions , in a state of winter sleep , preserving their energy by limiting its dissipation . " Although no one conducted intelligence tests on the oldtime peasant in the midst of his winter sleep , almost anyone can readily believe that the level of mental activity was probably very low . China and India sometimes have millions of starving specimens on hand which might be someone 's raw material for studying this mental problem , but no one has undertaken it . It is known that waves of deficiency diseases and a sharp rise in the incidence of ill-health always follow famines , but it must be admitted that the exact effect on mentality is still an open question . There have been a few laboratory tests that offer some comfort to the fasting enthusiasts . In maze-running experiments , rats who have all they want to eat are slower in motion and solve the maze less rapidly than underfed brethren , but they make fewer mistakes . Usually the reward at the end of the maze is some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a greater incentive for getting there . In 1917 twenty-four college students at the Y. M. C. A. college in Springfield , Massachusetts , volunteered to submit to a four-months ' dietary test , restricted in calorie content to such an extent that their body weight would decrease  | by about 10 per cent . The average daily ration given per man was just under 2,000 calories , about two-thirds of their normal intake . An indirect objective of the test was to see if a war-time restriction of food intake would allow a person to keep his performance up to standard , so these students were kept at their usual activities throughout the test . The men lost weight according to schedule but unfortunately not their appetites . There seemed to be no particularly detrimental physiological results . The basal metabolic rate of energy dissipation dropped 15 to 20 per cent . But it must be remembered that these men were not starving , though they were eating below average . Their individual weights at the low point were still within the span considered normal on a height ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grades up to their previous levels but they suffered in some specific tests . There was a decrease in accuracy , in clerical efficiency , and in the ability to discriminate between one musical pitch and another , but memory , visual reactions and those abilities which , in human beings , are analogous to the mazelearning abilities of rats remained unchanged . The students all reported a decreased ability to concentrate , an increased irritability , a tendency toward fatigue and a loss of sexual desire . Because of this last item the subjects spent practically no time with the girls , which might explain their maintenance of scholastic standing . In any case here is experimental proof of the validity of the time-honored saying that : " The way to a man 's heart is through his stomach . " The Springfield Y. M. C. A. test did demonstrate that it is possible for some to maintain scholastic performance for a few months on a small amount of food , but it did n't demonstrate that this would be true for the average individual nor that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the participants to prove that the restricted diet was not injurious ? not because they enjoyed it  | but because this test might help out the question of food supply during war-time . This was a period when anyone who indicated a way to increase national efficiency became a public hero . Moreover , the test was only four months long and even a college student can see four months ahead and keep up his spirits on the prospect of release in the near future . If they had been put on that diet with no hope of change there would have been a note of extreme discouragement , and hope is a wonderful stimulator . Besides , four months is physiologically but a very short time for human beings ? about one-half of one per cent of a lifetime . Men have survived for two months with no food at all . If the test had run four years instead of four months there might have been cumulative effects which would perhaps have changed the picture entirely . One important feature of these diets was that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of it . There were no particular vitamin or mineral deficiencies . That makes a great deal of difference . Summarizing the discussion of diet in relation to mentality : almost any prolonged vitamin deficiency and some mineral deficiencies have a deleterious effect on the nervous system and mental ability suffers . A very high protein diet promotes intestinal putrefaction and lethargy , and lapse of abilities always accompanies these . Lowered mentality seems to accompany diets of very low protein or those in which the proteins are entirely of vegetable origin . If the diet is properly balanced it is possible to remain mentally efficient on a much smaller amount of food than is ordinarily used . It is doubtful , however , that the average person would meet the situation with sufficient will-to-win to keep the mental attainments up to par for any length of time . But if the effect on adults of underfeeding is problematical , there is no doubt that poorly fed children suffer physically and mentally and never quite catch up . Moreover , the " dumb " athlete is  | a myth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur in good physiques more often than not . When one thinks of the low or non-existent scholastic standing of many famous athletes he must remember that the factor of motivation enters in ? an entirely different matter . In general , it seems certain that the rules for adequate mental health are the same as those for good physical health , and that , though there are thousands of exceptions , the alert minds tend to occur in the healthy and active bodies .   STAMINA NO MATTER how well-inoculated or air-conditioned our future lives may be our survival depends on our staying power . This applies to individuals as well as races . Life is a long race and the pay-off comes at the finishing tape , not at the end of a short spurt . A flash in the pan , no matter how brilliant , is quickly forgotten . Without taking part in the old case of Nature v. Nurture , or Heredity v. Environment , it will not be amiss to point out some of the items of nurture that unquestionably have bearing upon the stamina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hereditary traits , whatever may have been their origin , have had a great deal to do with it . The individuals who have survived longest have been those with an unquenchable will to live . Those of our predecessors to whom life was a matter of indifference or who found living repulsive , inevitably became negligent in some essential thing ? such as killing an enemy , or storing up food for winter ? and passed out early in life leaving few if any children . Their spinelessness was interred with their bones leaving the world to the strong backs and the strong wills . So we have with us , always and inevitably , the will to live . How many of the other articles in the stock and trade of heredity are significant in race survival or accomplishment can be argued ad infinitum without proving much of anything . The results of any mental tests which have been designed to measure innate mentality , divorced in so far as possible from environmental factors , have been disappoint- ing to those who maintain that there are vast mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentality but they are by no means commensurate with differences in accomplishment . Mere chance undoubtedly plays a large part in the fate of nations just as it does in individuals . Climate , natural resources , neighbors , character of leaders all contribute to the course of history ? and above all nutrition plays a hand . RACIAL VIGOR Anyone would be hard put to it to prove beyond all doubt that change of menu has ever marred a nation , but he could present to this effect no small quantity of circumstantial evidence , and people have been hanged on less . One timehonored method of defeating an army is to starve it , and the same might very well apply to a race ? even if the starvation only involved one of the many essential elements of nutrition . Egypt flourished for a few thousand years on the bounty of the Nile , then took up the use of refined , elaborately cooked , more delicate and less nutritious foods and relatively soon passed into obscurity . The condition of the teeth , which is a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily worse with the advance of the centuries . Racial stamina probably followed the downward trend of the teeth . Had there been complete medical records in those days they very likely would have shown increased incidence of infectious and degenerative diseases . In Rome at a later date the cycle was the same : a diet of rich , refined foods deficient in the simple nutritive elements resulted in the rising incidence of bad teeth and finally in political downfall . There is no absolute proof of the relationship between diet and stamina , but such evidence has occurred too often to be dismissed as casual chance . &s; long as the strength of a nation depends on manual and mental power it seems self-evident that the stamina of the  | group is the summation of the vitality of the individuals . A malnourished person loses some of his mental and physical powers . If a large proportion of any group is starved , in even one essential item , accomplishment must suffer . Perhaps the largest group study which had for its purpose the relation of diet to national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India while he was in charge of the medical service there for 20 years . He found the staple article of diet of the masses to be cereal grains ? wheat , barley , millet , maize and rice , generally eaten whole , seldom refined . He found that the nutritive value of these cereals depended on the condition of the soil , the manure used , and irrigation . He reported that nothing could be more striking than the contrast between the manly , resolute and stalwart Sikh tribe of North India and the poorly developed , toneless , supine Bengali and Madrassi tribes of the east and south . He concluded that food was the paramount cause of this difference . It is the Sikhs who usually appear in the headlines when there has been a bit of Indian trouble for the British . The typical diet of the stalwart Sikhs included fresh whole wheat , milk , butter , legumes , vegetables , tomatoes , fresh meat and root vegetables . He found some of the finest specimens of mankind among this tribe . The diet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable oils , coffee , sugar , cocoanut , betel nut , little milk and some fresh vegetables . They have also slowly been adopting the use of white bread and refined cereals . When McCarrison fed these typical diets to two groups of rats , those on the Sikh diet gained 235 grams and had no illness while those on the Madrassi diet only gained 155 grams and were short-lived . The Sikh diet also supported rat life much better than did the typical English diet . His study included the diets of all the tribes of India and  | he found that the diets producing the greater stamina and the more efficient and finest physical specimens contained more vitamin A and B , more fish and meat , milk and butter , more whole grains and leafy vegetables . He found that millions of people in India were malnourished and that deficiency diseases were widespread . Earlier investigation of the same sort in India was that of Major McCay . It was of somewhat more limited scope , being focused upon the amount of protein in the diet rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the great question in nutrition was : how much protein should one eat ? McCay found superior stamina among the peoples of India who had high protein diets . The Sikhs were far superior to the Bengali , just as McCarrison noted . The real difference , however , was in the greater amount of protective foods eaten by the tribes of the north . ( Protective foods are those that furnish an abundance of minerals and vitamins ? milk , fruit , vegetables and eggs . Butter and cream furnish some vitamins , but are not usually classed as protective . ) Orr and Gilks of England described similar contrasting conditions existing between two African tribes ? the Kikuyu , an agricultural , vegetarian tribe , and the Masai , a pastoral , carnivorous tribe . The Masai diet was found to be far superior to that of the Kikuyu . The Kikuyu diet consisted mostly of cereals , tubers , legumes , plantains , green leaves , earth from salt licks , etc . That of the Masai included meat , milk , raw blood , maize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Masai natives averaged five inches taller , twenty three pounds heavier and had so per cent greater muscular strength . Bone and dental defects , anemia , ulcers , bronchitis and many other diseases were much less common among them than among the Kikuyu . In contrast an appalling condition existed in these respects among the Kikuyu . The table on following page shows some of the ailments to which the Masai were less susceptible .  | These variations in physical well-being among savages and semi-savages demonstrate that there is no excellence in primitiveness , per se . The authors have no intention of holding up primitive life as the ideal for a permanent mode of living . It tends to be unpleasant , uncomfortable , filthy , inefficient and mentally narrow . The point to be made is that civilization has spoiled some of the better food practices of savage peoples and usually has provided no adequate substitute . Civilization 's principal contributions to a better way of life have been improved tools , weapons , and sanitation , the combating of infectious diseases and the greater efficiency made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderns , however , is still below that of the best primitives . In this direction , we have much improving to do . Sufficient knowledge is now at hand so that it would be possible , if it were universally applied , to support a large population , cut down infant mortality to a very low figure , and still have an adult race as stalwart and vigorous as any primitive tribe that ever existed . To any who believe that we Americans at present are a stalwart race , it may be well to point out the damning evidence of the army draft of the years 1917-18 . A complete cross-section of male America at the age of the peak of physical powers was examined for physical fitness . Even by the crude standards of the army , one-half of America 's young men were found to be physically defective , and one-half of this number were so seriously handicapped that they could not be taken for military service , despite the need for men . A large part of the  | deficiencies were of the kind that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well of the American table , nor , for that matter , of the American future . If we are to put any large bump into the permanent curve of history we must improve our social stamina . The vigor of a race is only the summation of the vigor of the individuals . The deleterious effects of inadequate nutrition on the physical and mental ability have been considered under the heads of the various specific deficiencies . But there is another index of stamina which is going to receive more and more public interest in the future ? longevity . Length of life is certainly one measure of staying power and is significant in an evaluation of social vigor . LONGEVITY Attempts to lengthen life by eating correctly have had rather disappointing results , for data are inconclusive . The only thing that a life insurance actuary can tell you is that longevity seems to be a hereditary trait . The members of some families die young ? others live disgustingly long , no matter what they do to themselves . But it is possible that even this hereditary tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb and retain iron , calcium , vitamins A , C , and G , or any other given elements of diet , were measured for a very large group of individuals one would not be at all surprised to find that the members of long-lived families have better power of assimilation which in turn is a result of the efficient functioning of the ductless glands . Assuming that investigation would reveal such a relationship between good assimilation and longevity , it would then seem logical that increasing the more essential factors in the diet might increase the span of life . In any elementary course in sociology worth the credit hours assigned it , one of the nuggets handed out for contemplation is this : Is the race working toward its own  | destruction by saving the lives of weakling infants , who would have died in the good old days , and letting them exist into a useless middle age and a dependent senility ? You may have ideas on the subject but it is quite certain that you have no acceptable answer . Perhaps there is no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Are most of these weaknesses at birth due to some of the fundamental factors of nutrition which can be remedied by diet in the prenatal period or in early childhood ? While we Americans are waiting to learn the answer , which could be found by extensive experiments , there are 20,000,000 of us living near or below the threshold of nutritive safety . We are dying at the rate of one every 40 seconds , and spending almost as much on chewing gum as on fundamental research . Despite the patching , wheedling and expensive attendance of physicians , the ultimate span of human life seems not to have been lengthened by so much as a single year . The chances of an oldster over sixty surviving another ten years are actually not quite as good now as they were a couple of hundred years ago . There are an amazing number of stories afloat to show that what you eat or do makes no difference . They usually revolve about the old soak who was a hell-bender all his life . Tobacco-stained , spreading alcoholic vapors with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very day of his death , at an even one hundred . His diet was everything that it should n't be , he violated every rule of health but he outlived them all ? and happily , too . He looked to be fifty but he topped a century . Investigations usually show that the figures actually were reversed : he lived to be fifty and looked a hundred . It seemed as if he had been around for a century because he made such a nuisance of himself . All careful investigations show that diet does have a most decided effect on health if not on longevity . But even if there is no positive proof as yet there
