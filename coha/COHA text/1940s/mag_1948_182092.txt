At Cidra , high in the mountains of central Puerto Rico , Luis Muoz Marin was taking it easy . The island 's first elected governor had shut himself off from the well-wishers who had turned his town house into a public place . Only for leathery jibaros ( farmers ) like Eustachio Prez Guzman was the door still open . Eustachio had vowed that if victory came to the Popular Democratic Party , he would go and kneel before Don Luis . To finance the journey , he had sold two of his six chickens , set out from his remote western hamlet of Isabela . <P> " Well , " said worldly Don Luis to Eustachio when he heard his story , " if you must kneel , there is nothing to stop me from kneeling too . " A cousin of Muoz urged him to pay Eustachio for the two chickens he had sold . Said Don Luis : " When a man gives you his soul , do you give him change ? " <P> Life on the Dole . Twenty-five years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muoz had described himself as " God 's pamphleteer , going with the mobs of hungry men &; women towards the great awakening . " His relation with his island 's straw-hatted jibaros is still pitched to that emotional key , but in eight years as President of the Insular Senate and chief of the ruling Popular Democrats he has also learned some sober facts of Puerto Rican life . <P> Politician Muoz tells his jibaros that the island 's troubles are a problem in multiplication . Since 1899 , Puerto Rico 's population ( now 2,200,000 ) has more than doubled . At present rates , it will rise another 36% by 1965 . The island 's sugar-based economy gives it an increasingly unfavorable trade balance with the U.S. ( last year 's : $140 million ) . U.S. expenditures for relief and public works have made Puerto Rico a vast and continuing WPA project . <P> During his eight years in power , Muoz has built the world 's largest tax-financed project of individual houses ( TIME , Aug. 23 ) , started an $11 million hospital program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 49 to 58 . But his chief tool for improvement is the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co . Under the driving management of 38-year-old , Barcelona-born Teodoro ( " Teddy " ) Moscoso Jr. , PRIDC is plugging the island 's advantages in openhanded tax concessions , cheap ( as low as 15-an-hour minimum ) labor , and plentiful , government-owned electric power . Moscoso 's salesmanship has already brought 42 new industries-ranging from rayon to radios-from the mainland . Since 1940 , while the population has risen 12% , production has been upped 30% . New inquiries from mainland industries are pouring in . <P> Labor on the Move . Muoz hopes that PRIDC 's program will make some 300,000 new industrial jobs by 1960 . He also hopes to double the number of Puerto Ricans ( 5,000 in 1948 ) who go to the U.S. as migratory farm workers . Even that will not eliminate Puerto Rico 's chronic labor surplus . For that , Muoz has only one remedy : orderly but large-scale emigration . One movement he wants to discourage at all costs is the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricans to the slums of Manhattan , Chicago , Gary and Lorain , Ohio .
