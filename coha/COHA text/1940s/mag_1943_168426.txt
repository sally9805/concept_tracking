Printing TIME on the Persian Gulf for the American soldiers in Iran is farthest East in more ways than one . The only press in the place is an ancient , hand-fed flatbed that had to be fanned for two hours to cool it off after an hour 's run . And when you read this report on how our first issue got printed , I think you will understand why nobody else has ever before tried to bring out a newsmagazine in the land of the houri . <P> " As soon as the plane arrived with the mats of TIME 'S August 16 issue mats are papiermach molds of type and illustrations I carried the package down to the largest print shop and with due ceremony informed the director of the honor that was about to befall him : permission to print the first issue of TIME 'S first Asiatic edition . <P> " He took one horrified look at the stack of 36 mats and gave the usual Persian answer : ' Impossible ! ' Then we settled down to negotiations , which involved convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages from the mats ( or could get it ) - that the casting would not take fifteen days ( if he could get the lead out of the pants of the zombie who did the work ) - that the only paper available would be usable if not ideal-that we would somehow manage to get him enough gelatin for the press roll ers-and that we would not complain too bitterly if his inferior ink smudged some of the illustrations . <P> " This took a whole day-and our printer finally did win one point : that this was the biggest job of its kind in all the history of Iran . " <P> In the end , the first issue of TIME-in- Iran was printed in seven days by Persian and Armenian workmen bossed by a Turk interpreter on Indian and British papers run off from a German-made press-for distribution to American boys who are getting vital Lend-Lease war goods through to Russia . So I guess this new edition is a truly " international " magazine if ever there was one . <P> Every week now thousands of copies are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Post Exchanges throughout Iran-to speed TIME 'S news to our troops there by as much as five weeks . <P> " TIME is helping to bring all the news of all the world to the Persian Gulf Service Command while it is still news , " cheered the U.S. Army Dispatch , weekly newspaper of the P.G.S.C. And Area Commander Donald H. Connolly said : " TIME will give our troops the broadest possible coverage of all phases of American life . " <P> TIME-in-Persia brings to six the number of TIME editions now printed thousands of miles away . The others are the three print ings in Latin America - Mexico City , Buenos Aires ( temporarily suspend ed ) and Bogot-one in Australia for General MacArthur 's men-and one in Honolulu for Hawaii and our is land outposts in the Mid-Pacific . <P> ' Still another far-off printing of TIME for still another A.E.F. is scheduled to begin almost any day now-so some week soon I will probably have another story to tell you about how the native contractors said it could n't be done-and then went ahead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
