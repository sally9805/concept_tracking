Fat-faced , bullnecked , roughshod William L. Ayers , managing editor of the Chicago Journal of Commerce ( circ. 24,000 ) , knew the time had come . Draft-stricken , he was going to have to hire women . He was going to have to hire women copyreaders . <P> No one , least of all his cryptic , cigar-chewing day-side news editor , Sid Forbes , had ever heard of a female copyreader . Forbes did not even like to think of one . The rest of the Journal staff , strong men all , paled . But , game to the core , Ayers hired six female copyreaders : his own secretary , the wife of the Journal 's drama critic , the wife of another Journal employe , a publicity man 's secretary , a trade publication employe , and a likely candidate fresh from Northwestern University 's journalism school . <P> For about ten days Managing Editor Ayers ( see cut , in center background ) lectured his charges on the mysteries of copyreading . At the end of the lecture course two dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor Forbes for slow polishing on the day-desk . <P> Came a hectic two weeks , but Forbes got through it , turned his semi-finished product over to Night Editor George Bradley , went back to cigar chewing . After two weeks Bradley , a crack copy editor , exploded . " These girls , " he roared to Ayers , " do n't know what I 'm talking about when I tell them anything about style , and they have no idea of what 's going on in the world ! " <P> Managing Editor Ayers wanted proof . With Ayers 's assent Bradley then carefully cooked up a fake wire story , in whose every line fantastic misstatements were flatly and plausibly inserted . He had it mimeographed , gave a copy to each of the four girls around the copy desk , told them to edit it and write a head ( see below ) . <P> After much pencil chewing the four copies came back to Bradley . Heads were on-one copyreader left the " s " out of Chrysler . But not one had questioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Journal and two female copyreaders parted company . The other pair hung on , pleading they thought the story was a practice exercise . Last week they joined the others . The Journal copy desk , though depleted , is once more staffed by men . <P> But William Ayers is not bull-necked for nothing . Says he , keeping out of earshot of Editor Bradley : " I 'm going to have that all-girl copy desk yet-the swellest hennery in town . Maybe my approach was n't right . "
