One sultry Sunday morning in August 1928 , a long-legged , eight-year-old youngster stood in his father 's alfalfa patch near Santaquin , Utah . Suddenly an airplane cleared its way through the haze , circled the field a few times , landed a few feet from the boy . The pilot , for no apparent reason , called to the boy and asked him if he would like a lift . The boy said his father was down at the Mormon Church at the moment , and he would n't mind going if they were back before church was out . So they took off , flipped around for awhile and came to earth again in the alfalfa patch . <P> Last week the same boy , now 21 , took off in a Hurricane , swept around the Channel looking for Jerries , came back to earth on a sodden British airfield . Awaiting him was an appointment as squadron leader of the American Eagle Squadron in Great Britain . <P> In the years between , blond , six-foot-three Squadron Leader Chesley Gordon Peterson , D.F.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brigham Young University . He had learned a lot about mathematics , agriculture and dancing . After college he worked in the Douglas Aircraft factory . But with the flying bug still in him , he joined the U.S. Air Corps as a cadet . He was finally kicked out , ostensibly because he was a " bloody awful flyer , " actually because he had lied about his age . <P> Slightly dismayed , he went back to work for Douglas Aircraft . The bug bit him again during the air battle of Britain . He went to Canada to join the R.A.F. <P> Failing to convince anybody that he was just what Britain needed ( at that time the Neutrality Act was enforced ) , he was sent back to the U.S. He tried again in July , and this time succeeded in getting to Britain . He was hustled straight into combat training and then to the operative Eagle Squadron . <P> Squadron Leader Peterson has taken part in more than 50 sweeps , destroyed five German aircraft , won Britain 's Distinguished Flying Cross for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also seen most of his pals killed or captured . Of 32 Eagle casualties , 20 are prisoners of war and twelve are dead . To replace these , 28 others are in training besides 84 Eagles who are now taking part in operations in England . Of the original Eagle Squadron of 34 men , Peterson and Flying Officer " Gus " Daymond of Van Nuys , Calif , are the only ones who remain .
