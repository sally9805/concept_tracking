txt The Naval Air Transport Service has casually announced its Pacific wing land and sea planes fly 5 , - 000,000 miles a month . San Francisco is studying a $20,000.000 airport bond issue . Pan American Airways forecasts a flight to Shanghai for slightly more than $300 . Little by little , the Pacific air accomplishments of the war years become the material from which air-line and civil-aeronautics officials dream their postwar air world . While planes and plans arc being blueprinted , personnel of rapidly expanding Army and Navy air transport organizations chart the world 's skyways . This station exemplifies the air advance of the Pacific . A little more than a year ago it was staffed by four or five officers and 40 enlisted men . Today there are nearly 10,000 Navy and 1.300 Army personnel working at what probably is the largest sea-land airport in the world . Huge Naval Air Station In the early darkness of a recent morning , on a routine flight from Guam to the Hawaiian Islands , our plane swung down into the naval air station . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restaurants , administration and freight terminal buildings , living quarters , and miles and miles of road , built on the reclaimed site on the Keehi Lagoon . We had traveled 3,000 miles In 20 hours . And ours was only one of a half dozen naval air transport flights between Guam and Honolulu on that day . We were fed two hot meals in flight . They cost 50 cents each , and one of them consisted of canned chicken , corn , green beans , pears , orange juice , bread and butter . Schedule Boosted Except for three brass hats who occupied " " chairs , we sat on angular bucket seats which have no respect for the anatomy or we rolled up in blankets on the deck . These are rigors which postwar travelers will be spared . Hundreds of such flights add up to the N. A. T. S. Pacific wing 's 5,000,000 miles monthly , a 300 per cent increase over the figure for al single month a year ago . The increased schedule means more than 30 planes are in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hours every day . The longest single hop still is 2,000 miles from San Francisco to Honolulu . To reach their by no means sky-high total of 5,000,000 miles monthly , the N. A. T. S. planes now are flying the equivalent of 2,500 runs between Hawaii and the mainland in a 30-day period . More equal In importance with performance accomplishments are the data being compiled . Every time a four-engined Douglas burns tires along the asphalt runways in the Marianas , every weather observation made , every navigational experience , adds something to a record which will contribute to the progress of postwar air travel , Familiar Territory By the time the war ends , the sky over the Pacific will have become an old and familiar territory to hundreds of navigators and pilots . Typical of these men Is Lieut. ( j.g . ) W. J. Hutchinson of Trenton , N. J. Before joining the Navy , the youthful flier had been an engineering student at Bucknell University . A N. A. T. S. plane commander , he told me. holds the Civil Aeronautics Authority 's highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takesabout two years , and he may make as many as 20 hops on a regular run as second pilot before being allowed to make a landing or takeoff . Many N. A. T. S. pilots had commercial air-line experience prior to the war . The Navy still has a few civilian pilots flying contract planes in its transport service . But the majority are naval personnel . Like those on our trip , they are former high school and college students , professional and businessmen . Our second pilot on the second leg of the hop had been a theological student before the war . Growth of Organization The growth of the N. A. T. S. organization was graphically attested to by Lieut . It C. Johnson , Dallas . Texas , plane commander on the second leg of the flight . In civilian life , Lieutenant Johnson was a lawyer and holder of a commercial pilot 's license . " Our squadron started out a year ago with 750 pilots and without any overseas runs at all , " he said . " Then we began flying to Honolulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since . Pilots in our outfit will reach almost double the original number in a few months . We average about 130 flying hours a month . " It seems unlikely this tremens , dons growth will reach its highest point until the rest of the Pacific has been spanned . And it is entirely possible that some of the Navy fliers who arc winging their way to the Pacific battle fronts today will be carrying $300 " fares " from $20,000,000 civilian airports to the capitals of the Orient in postwar tomorrow . The proposed New Virk-London rate is only slightly rrore than lour cents a mile , John C. Leslie . Atlantic Division Manager of P. A. A .. points out . or airoul the tourist steamer rate before the war and sharply below first-class and cabin rates . Bid for Travel Boost Such rates are expected to attract the " average man , " to whom P. A. A. looks for the great upsurge in postwar air travel . The estimated air-traffic figure for a typical postwar year is about 75 per cent of the steamer travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Leslie also noted that the rates are " total rates  --  with no extras . " In other words , complimentary meals will continae to be served , the " no-tipping " policy will be followed , and the rate does not require additional connecting rail charges , but is to the city for which a ticket is bought . For those who wish some steamer travel , a combination air-water ticket will be sold  --  going one way by boat and the other way by Clipper . To the European Continent , there are week-end air cruises planned . One is scheduled to Paris at a cost of approximately $200 . The proposed schedule calls for the plane leaving New York on Friday at 3 p. m. , arriving in Paris the following morning . Passengers will be allowed two days for sightseeing in the capital before returning to New York in time for work Monday morning . Here are some other round-trip tantalizers : New York to Mexico City , $110.70 ; New York to Moscow , $259.20 ; and New York to Hong Kong $594 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used on these transoceanic flights range from a 48-passenger plane to a " mock-up " of a 400-passenger transport plane . There are also plans for a huge Stratoliner capable of carrying 86 persons nonstop flight from New York to London in 13 hours at a cost of $186.30 . The two huge planes to be used by P. A. ** DC7 , carry . ing 93 passengers by day and 79 by night across the Atlantic and tic i12-ton 128- and l I 9-possengcr plane  --  will provide a choice of sleeping Mr. Leslie said , Whh ! emphiisizing that identical meal- , steward , and other service would be provided all passengers . Mr. Leslie explained that it was thought that must peo. pie would appreciate a fare saving of 25 per cent by not taking berths . For thi , ; reason , the majority of facilities will be comfortable reclining chairs , with Pullman-type berths available at 25 per cent additional fare and berths in staterooms for two available at a 35 per cent pre . !

" Large size is , vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is our belief that the low rates neces sary to make this service as useful to the public as it should be can be attained only by use of large aircraft capable of carrying heavy loads over long distances at low operating costs and through the operation of a sufficient num ? ber of aircraft by a single operator to give efficient utilization .
