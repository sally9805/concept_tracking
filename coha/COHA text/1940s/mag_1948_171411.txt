Cord Meyer Jr. , 27 , is a pale young man with a preoccupied smile and wavy brown hair . His paleness and his preoccupation are the marks of war : he was very nearly killed on Guam . He lost an eye and had his face shattered when a Jap grenade exploded in his foxhole. * Since his discharge from the Marines , Cord Meyer has been a young man on a crusade . He is the president of United World Federalists , which seeks to save the world through a limited federation before an atomic war destroys it . <P> He has been talking night &; day , at colleges , over the radio , to public audiences , to anyone and everyone who will listen . He has written a book ( Peace or Anarchy ) which , while not exactly a bestseller , has gone into five printings of 13,000 copies . <P> Last week he spoke in the graceful drawing room of Manhattan 's English Speaking Union . <P> The middle-aged audience listened to him attentively , then engaged him in spirited debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his position , talks fast , and is convinced that there is no time to lose . <P> The Plan . Cord Meyer is the son of a wealthy New York real estate man and onetime diplomat . Before World War II , he was a top honor student at Yale and editor of the Yale Lit . After he was wounded and sent home from the Pacific , he married Mary Pinchot , the comely niece of Pennsylvania 's late Governor Gifford Pinchot . He had got started on his crusade when he served as " veteran aide " to Delegate Harold Stassen at the San Francisco Conference . There he saw the United Nations born . He deplored the veto , which left U.N . virtually powerless to prevent aggression . <P> The Hope . He sees no hope in U.N . as it is now , calling it " a weak league of sovereign , armed states preparing for war . " As his ideas took shape , he framed a program . He wants : 1 ) an agreement among all nations to surrender their arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep internal order ; 2 ) a U.N . police force to defend all nations from aggression ; and 3 ) an Assembly acting as the world 's chief legislative body , with a Security Council acting as a Cabinet . <P> He is not proposing a One-World government and world constitution ; that would take too much time - more time , he thinks , than the world has . He is young enough to feel that his elders are timid , and mature enough to know that the present uneasy peace can not last . And he is being heard . He disregards cynics . He thinks of himself as a practical realist and considers optimism foolish but hope necessary . " If this hope is naive , " he says , " then it is naive to hope . " <P> * His twin brother was killed on Okinawa.
