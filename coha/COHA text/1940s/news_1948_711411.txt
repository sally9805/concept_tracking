txt The public hearing on Monday by the Board of Estimate on the three pier rehabilitation plans that have been presented to the Mayor , and developments since . then , have tended in some respects to clarify and in others to confuse the issue . That issue is which agency is best fitted to do the job and when it should begin . On the credit side has been the illumination of the present inadequacies of the city 's waterfront properties , on which so much of the economic health of the city depends . Everyone , agrees that something should be done and that it should . be done soon . On the debit side has been the raising of political , sectional and extraneous issues that should not be allowed to influence the decision . If the decision is made solely on the basis of which of the three agencies that have drawn the preliminary plans  --  the Port of New York Authority , the recently organized World Trade Corporation or the city 's own Department of Marine and Aviation ? is best fitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get at it immediately , we believe that the Port Authority will be the choice . It has presented the best plan , one which would reorganize as well as rehabilitate the piers , help unsnarl the traffic congestion on the land side of the waterfront and provide the funds and the credit for continued modernization . The Port Authority plan may not be perfect . It has been criticized in detail both by shipping men and by others who would be affected . But we have not yet heard the Port Authority say that its plan is frozen , or that reasonable changes could not still be made , or be made at a later date if experience proved that to be wise . The most fallacious arguments made against the Port Authority plan are that the city should not surrender its piers to an agency over which it would have no control and that it should , receive all profits from their operation instead of having 25 per cent of such profits after twelve years put in a reserve fund of the Authority for possible use , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York area . If the Port Authority were a private agency set up to make a profit the first argument might be valid . It is not such an agency . Its profits are used only for other improvements of the port . It has done an outstanding job in other fields . It has maintained an integrity unsurpassed by any other official or quasi-official agency . Under the Authority the city 's docks would be in safe hands for the fifty years of the contract , and would be returned to the city at the end of that period as a modern , efficient waterfront operation . As to the reserve fund , it is one aspect of Port Authority operation that makes it so attractive . By that means it is able to finance at low cost improvements that separate authorities could not hope to finance at considerably greater interest rates . The Port Authority Plan offers the city an opportunity to have its piers rehabilitated , reconstructed and maintained without capital outlay by the city , at this time , of funds that are so desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price local sovereignty and political control of rehabilitation and reconstruction against that prospect ? .
