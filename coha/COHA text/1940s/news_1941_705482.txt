txt City dwellers , going apartment hunting these spring days , find that most of the neighborhoods conveniently near the downtown area where they work are run down , " slummy . " So they turn toward the suburbs , and the municipality loses them as citizens and as taxpayers , while the blighted areas continue to run up big bills for services . Nov the big cities are trying to do something to reverse this trend . In three or four States bills are being introduced this session intended to encourage private capital to go into these blighted areas and rebuild them on a large scale so that once again they will become pleasant places for people to live in . Indeed , framers of these bills hope that such " redevelopment " will make the neighborhoods better than they ever were before , with well planned streets and plenty of green play spaces . The Illinois bill , now in the Legislature , is a fair sample of the type of legislation being put forward . It is aimed particularly to restore some 40 square miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the treasury than it takes to finance police , fire protection . and other services in the same 40 square miles . The New York bill goes considerably farther than that of Illinois in requiring acquisition of only 40 per cent of the property before the remainder can be condemned , and granting 10 years tax exemption on redeveloped land and buildings . It is described by its sponsors as a liberalized version of the bill vetoed by the Governor last session . Michigan and Minnesota are also reported shaping up bills for introduction this season . Individual cities , too , are at work on the problem of blight in their central areas , reports the National Association of Housing Officials . Toronto , Ont. , is extending public credit to private owners for repair and remodeling of substandard housing .
