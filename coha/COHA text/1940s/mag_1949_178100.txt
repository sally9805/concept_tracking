Steel and coal made the big news . But across the nation 's labor fronts three other costly , protracted strikes tugged at the economic lifelines . <P> In New York , after 16 weeks of sporadic violence , half of the Bell Aircraft Corps. ' s 3,000 workers were still holding out for a 15-an-hour wage hike , $100-a-month noncontributory pensions and other benefits which the company estimated at an overall 62-an-hour increase . Trying out a new tactic , striking members of the United Auto Workers Local 501 observed Ladies ' Day on the picket lines . Helmeted , club-swinging strikers ' wives attacked three Bell engineers who tried to pass through . Deputy sheriffs , clubs at the ready , promptly arrested a handful of the women , then found themselves engaged in a pitched battle with the husbands . The melee was broken up only after the sheriff ordered tear-gas bombs dropped from a low-flying helicopter hovering overhead . <P> In Missouri , officials of the Missouri Pacific and its striking engineers , firemen , trainmen and conductors still stared at one another in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers three weeks ago ( TIME , Sept. 19 ) , both sides had steadfastly refused to yield an inch . During that time , MoPac had lost more than $12 million in revenue . Most of its customers were being taken care of by trucks , buses and competing rail lines . But in Arkansas , 55 factories employing almost 3,500 persons were closed because of the MoPac shutdown ; farmers in the Kansas City area reported heavy losses because of lack of transportation for their livestock . Confronted with the certainty of such distress , the MoPac strikers had refused to work through the National Railroad Adjustment Board , which is established by law for the settlement of just such matters . <P> Last week , MoPac officials went all out : they proposed that the dispute be submitted to a panel of referees . MoPac would abide by the decisions of the panel , but the rail unions would not have to . There was only one condition to the offer : call off the strike at once . <P> In Hawaii , the iron-fisted embargo that Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor last May ( TIME , July 4 ) was beginning to rust through in several places . The trickle of cargo that had begun when the territorial government seized the docks seven weeks ago was growing to a stream . Freighters arrived and unloaded autos , Christmas tinsel , cattle feed , canned soup and nylons , left the same day with their holds crammed with bagged raw sugar and cases of pineapple . But when the pineapple-laden freighters hit the U.S. West Coast , their " hot " cargoes found a warm reception from Bridges ' longshoremen . At The Dalles , Ore. , on the Columbia River , one skipper abandoned efforts to unload his cargo after Bridges ' men mauled a pick-up crew of local farmers and cowhands . Trucks were smashed , machinery damaged and several truck drivers beaten up . Other longshoremen began an air-sea patrol to look out for other attempts to land the forbidden fruit . But Harry Bridges seemed to be about willing to talk compromise at last . At week 's end , he flew to Honolulu " for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
