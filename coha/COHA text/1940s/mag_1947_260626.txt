To most modern Christians , the days of the Early Church are vague and far-off times for scholars to quibble over . But no era in the church 's history was more exciting . The early leaders , with their strange-sounding names-Polycarp , Athenagoras , Asterius of Amasea-were spiritual pioneers whose adventures in the faith built a legacy for all Christians . <P> To bring these all-but-forgotten church fathers back into their own , a group of 84 Roman Catholic scholars in the U.S. and Canada have undertaken a head-spinning job-the translation of 300 patristic writings , to be published in a set of 72 volumes called The Fathers of the Church . The idea for the series came from an Augustine scholar , Dr. Ludwig Schopp , a New York rare book dealer who three years ago transmitted his enthusiasm , to Publisher Anthony Cima . <P> When Cima ran short of funds before the first volume was printed , other publishing houses refused to join in such a formidably uncommercial undertaking . <P> Publisher Cima went ahead anyhow , is trusting to God 's providence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seven-man editorial board which plans to bring out at least one volume a month for the next five or six years . <P> Schism &; Discipline . The first volume of the series , * The Apostolic Fathers , is already out . Ready for distribution this week is the first of the 22 volumes that will be devoted to Saint Augustine . If these first two are typical , the series may reach an audience of unlooked-for size . <P> The translations are as crisp and readable as many a modern bestseller . <P> In the 1st Century and the early part of the 2nd , the little groups of Christians scattered along the shores of the Mediterranean were still without a recognized body of revealed Scripture , and relied heavily upon letters ( epistles ) from church leaders . Some of these letters , carefully preserved and read publicly from time to time , are the chief source of knowledge about the first fathers . <P> Though the details of their lives are largely conjectural , their personalities are sometimes sharply revealed in the letters they wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these epistles . <P> Soul &; Body . High point of The Apostolic Fathers is the " Letter to Diognetus . " Written in the form of a letter to a pagan to describe " this new group or institute " which calls itself " Christian , " its moving characterization of the sect is still a counsel of perfection . Excerpt : " Christians are not different from the rest of men in nationality , speech or customs ; they do not live in states of their own , nor do they use a special language , nor adopt a peculiar way of life . Their teaching is not the kind of thing that could be discovered by the wisdom or reflection of mere active-minded men ; in deed , they are not outstanding in human learning as others are . . . . They live , each in his native land - but as though they were not really at home there . They share in all duties like citizens and suffer all hardships like strangers . Every foreign land is for them a fatherland and every fatherland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , but they are citizens of heaven . <P> They obey the laws that men make , but their lives are better than the laws . They love all men , but are persecuted by all . . . .
