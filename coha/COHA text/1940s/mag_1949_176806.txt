Early Sunday morning , three days after he attended Laurence Duggan 's funeral ( see cut ) , Sumner Welles was found unconscious and nearly frozen to death in a bleak field near his Maryland estate , about a mile south of Washington 's city limits . <P> Neighbors on their way home from church saw the tall , 56-year-old ex-Under Secretary of State , bareheaded and wearing a heavy fur coat , prostrate beside a lonesome road . His face had been scratched by briers , but there was no sign that he had been attacked . His clothes were frozen to his body ; apparently he had fallen into a stream , stumbled out and collapsed a little distance beyond . He had lain there some eight hours before he was found . <P> Taken to the Casualty Hospital in Washington , Welles soon recovered consciousness , said he could not remember what had happened . He was suffering from exposure and frostbitten fingers and toes . <P> At Welles 's magnificent Oxon Hill estate , his valet reported that Welles had worked late that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valet to go to bed , that he was going for a short walk . That was the last any of the servants saw of their reserved , austere employer that night . It was not unusual for Welles to take late walks ; he had insomnia . His doctor said that he had been troubled with heart disease ever since he had had a heart attack 18 years ago . Lately he had been deeply upset by the death of Laurence Duggan , who had been his protg and a close friend .
