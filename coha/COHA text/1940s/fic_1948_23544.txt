THE SNIFF A STORY BY V. S. PRITCHETT Illustrated by Bernard Perlin I r Is hard to say what the present situa-tion is , whether it is improving or whether it is becoming one of those everlasting situations that mark the characters and memories of children . These have all noticed their mother 's habit of looking up from her sewing , raising her straight nose and giving a sniff as if she were going to say , " Pop outside and see what 's burning " ? that sniff has become established since their father came back from the war . Her candid children glance at one another and then , without self-betrayal , they copy the sniff . The last one copies it loudly . It is not a snuffling nor a weeping sound ; it is alert , questing and suspicious : " I think I smell burning again . " After a few of these sniffs there is a look of wooden melancholy on her face and she sighs , she looks sullenly up at the window and the continuing daylight . She listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) the ceiling is like dirty thawing snow , trodden all over by the hundreds of footmarks of someone who will not come down . She is a woman of thirty-seven who has dull , fair hair , a long face , warm-tempered , gray eyes and her hands and elbows are going all day long . She has what she calls " a woman 's life . " Her husband ( who is the man upstairs ) is her age and works in the boys ' outfitting department of a big shop . He is one of those men who like to sec other people promoted over their heads . Themanager , Mr. Frederick , for example , began in the shop , at the same counter with him . Between these two , Mr. Frederick and her husband , the wife feels  --  how can she put it ? ? she feels that her heart has become a cage and that she can not get out of it . Perhaps " cage " is the wrong word ; for what she really feels is that she is enclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that : a literal smell . It is not a strong smell , for sometimes it is hardly noticeable ; but it is always there and on Saturdays and Sundays , it is openly there , strong , animal , and violent ; so that she gets up restlessly and goes round the house unconsciously following it , searching for it , until at last she finds it . And when she finds it , she stands , as still as stone , unable to speak . Her husband looks up and tells her that what she needs is a holiday . He is not as tall as she is , indeed he is not as tall as most people . His large , astounded , dark blue eyes are raised under caterpillar eyebrows as if he were standing on tiptoe . He has a wide swarthy face  --  though he has lost color since he came back from the war  --  a low , monkeyish forehead , and a cap of black curls over his head . The widely opened eyes appear to be talking with astonishment , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is astonished by the goods he sells , the customers he sees , by every woman he sees ; by his wife , his children . Astonished at being married now fifteen years , astonished by what happened to him during the war . There is only one thing that does not astonish him . w HEN he came back from the war she saw with relief he had aged as much as she had . Those gazing doll 's eyes of his , so childish and so surprised , were beginning to look out of the stupor of middle age . He seemed to be a man who was going to live on his kindness to himself . " One good thing " ( she thought with pleasure , with pity and the spite that comes of dealing with children all day for years ) " one good thing " ( she thought ) " the girls wo n't be after you . " In the old days at the shop the girls were mad about him and he was mad about them . But only mad . Before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get him away from them ; but once she was married she did not mind . That was the one certain control of him : the shop . The hateful thing about the war was that neither she nor the shop ruled him , and what he would be like then she could not imagine . What had happened to him during the war ? He told her everything , but surely there was something else ? He came back . She watched the crust of Italy and Africa pass from his skin and saw the paler man underneath appear . " I used to think ? " he would begin . Think ! Imagine it , he had time to think . For five years she had been trailing after children , cooking , cleaning , mending , queueing , and he came home and told her he used to " think . " Well , what was the marvelous " thought " ? " Five years out of our lives , " he said . Good heavens , do you call that a " thought " ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can out of life , he said . The children might be calling and she would be glad to leave the room . No wonder he never got on at the shop , if that was what he called " thinking . " When she went out shopping she listened to some of the other women . To the woman next door : " They 're lazy . They 've life is like . They go round another like dogs . Do n't settle down . " What the other women were saying with their eyes and sometimes with their tongues was : " I bet there 's been another woman . They are doped with memory . Have you got a clear conscience ? " She almost wished there had been another woman , almost wished she had not got a clear conscience . H E WAS a good husband . On Saturday afternoons she went out and he stayed at home and looked after the children . She used to go out giving orders in all directions and came back to see which had been disobeyed . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproachable . One Saturday she went out and when she got to the gate of the house , she saw the lights were not lit . The curtains hung like an abandoned tenantry . In the hall no light , and in the house no sound . The air was still . The coats on their hooks , the closed doors of the rooms , the silence , indicated a place absorbed in itself . And then  --  her heart jumped . She was in the wrong house . This place did not smell like hers . She was treading on some other woman 's floor polish . She took a breath and the skin of her nostrils moved to the prick of some new smell that might have been the smell of an unsweet flower , like the garlic flower . She opened the sitting room door and , for the first time , sniffed . The smell was not in the sitting room . She went to the foot of the stairs and again she sniffed , but there too the scent weakened . For a moment she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room , she expected to find her sitting there , an odorous creature with bare , vaccinated arms and hot flowered lap , painting her nails , but the dining room was empty . The scent strengthened as she approached the kitchen . No : it could not be another woman ; but perhaps he had washed the dog , polished the brass . She opened the kitchen door and the wild smell raced to her . " Where 's the light ? " she called out . In the kitchen the daylight had decayed . He was sitting at the kitchen table with a box of oil paints before him , his thumb in a gaudy palette . He was painting a small picture of the kitchen with its plate rack and sink and beside him the children stood watching silently . Even he did not look up but went on painting . " Ssh , " said the eldest girl , as her mother went to put her bag on the table . " Do n't jog him . " The children moved nearer to protect the sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without warning , taken up painting . " Look , " the children said . They opened a roll of sketches he had done in the war : crayon drawings , water-colors of soldiers , the pyramids , sand dunes , Italian towns . She could not speak . " You never told me , " she said . She gazed at his secret life with consternation . The look of astonishment had gone from him . He looked determined , ashamed , and unnaturally boastful . " I thought I 'd have a go at the old oils , " he said in a dishonest voice . She looked at the sink . The washing up was done . The room was clean , Newspaper had been spread on the table . He was wearing an old jacket . Nothing ( she had to agree ) was " wrong . " She laughed . " What a blessed kid you are , " she said . " Where 's these poor children 's teas ? " " We do n't want any tea , " the children said together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ashamed voice . " Secondhand . " He put his brushes down . " No , " cried the children . " You have n't finished . " " The light 's gone , " he said . And he spoke so sadly that the children turned indignantly toward the window at the fading sky . His wife switched on the light and she could have died laughing when she saw his face change . " It 's wrong , " he said . " It 's the perspective . I 'll have to start again . " " Is this what they taught you in the Army ? " she said . " Yes , " he said . " The only thing . Time drags , you 've got to do something . " T HEIR neighbor was a dirty , gleeful woman bobbing up and down with curiosity about everything . She wore horn-rimmed spectacles and she used to stand on a box and look over the fence by the kitchen door . Her shoulders were out of sight and the head appeared to rest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird 's egg . " We do n't know what they 've been through , " the neighbor said . " A man wants a hobby , " his wife said . " Some men spend it on drink and some on women or the dogs , " said the neighbor . " He , " his wife nodded to her husband who was crouching over his oil paints on a kitchen chair at the end of the garden . " He does n't even smoke . Every night he comes home , it 's the same . I wish he 'd paint the kitchen . " " It keeps him in , mine 's always out , " said the neighbor greedily . " Has he done your picture ? " " Years ago , " said his wife , " when I was in the shop all the girls were after him saying ' Draw me , draw me , ' posing for him anyone would think they were  --  I do n't know what they thought they were . " " Film stars , " said the neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to tell them , " his wife said remembering . " He asked me but I would n't let him . It 's funny how things begin . I said to him , Ca n't you find something better to do ? Or are you daft ? ' " She laughed . " What did he say ? " said the neighbor . " That 's how we got married . I made him stop it , " she said . He stopped drawing altogether when he was in love with her . Now he came up from the bottom of the garden , astonished of course . Astonished by the sight of the neighbor 's bodiless head balanced on the wooden fence ; even more astonished when a hand came up from nowhere and removed the spectacles . " When are you going to do my portrait ? " said the neighbor with a rich and sickly smile . H E HAD no sense . A few weeks passed and he showed his pictures to Mr. Frederick , the manager . " Mr. Frederick says I have genius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not astonish him . " How that man 's got on , " she said . " Climbing on other people 's shoulders , " she said . " You 're unfair to him , " he said . " Only because he flatters you , you like him , " she said . The smell was , she thought , the worst thing . Sometimes he painted flowers , sometimes a corner of the garden , sometimes he tried to turn his Italian sketches into a large oil painting ; and they all smelled . He took to standing his best ones on the mantelpiece and she knew at once . They were awkward , living , chopped-off little pictures , unbearably new  --  not like pictures you see in a shop or a magazine  --  raw , like small joints of meat in a butcher 's . When she knew Mr. Frederick had praised them she saw that Mr. Frederick had " got on " by sheer unscrupulousness . Her husband came home , changed his jacket and went up to the box room and if she went there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell made her sniff but he took no notice of that ; he simply grunted . She sniffed . He grunted . He would sit there holding his breath  --  it was a marvel  --  for as much as a minute , and then puff it out , with the labor of a man lifting a heavy piece of furniture upstairs , Sniff . Grunt . That enormous grunt : that was their only conversation . All these years trailing after children , all these years waiting for your husband to come home , all these years getting older  --  and then , when he did come , he did n't speak ! Not much of a life for a woman . " As long as it keeps him happy , " the neighbor said . " I like a contented man . " " By the pound , in a shop , " her husband said . What began to alarm her was that this painting did not make him happy . Hear him ! How he carried on , moaning and groaning ! It was " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or he got stuck and painted it all out ( that was waste for you ) and started again . Well , she told him , if I could n't do a thing , I 'd give it up , not make myself miserable . I mean what 's the use of giving yourself the pip . He grunted . " You say all your life you wanted to paint , if only you could paint you 'd be happy , " she said . " You said I stopped you when we were married . " She sniffed . " I did n't say that , " he said with astonishment . She had got a reply from him at last ! That time when she refused to be drawn like the other girls in the shop , had risen to prick her conscience . " It 's what you meant , " she said.HE PUT his brush sideways in his mouth ; the brush looked like a mustache there ; he gazed at her . " Well look at you , " she said . " It makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was untrue : the children loved him to paint . She could not forgive them that . ) " You do n't think of us . It 's turned you selfish , Always breathing that stuff into your system . It 's poisoning you . " He put the brush down and started explaining to her about the picture . She'was not listening ; she was riding her wrongs , galloping away on them ; but all the same , the words that caught her ear : Perspwhat was it ? ? Chiaro  --  how d' you do ? His eyes got larger and larger , astonished by the difficulty he had of trying to say what was in his mind . " You 're too trustful of people , showing that picture to Mr. Frederick . He 'll genius you out of the shop . " " I 'd be free then , " he said . " An artist ca n't work without time and freedom . I was sort of free in the Army , " he said . " Free of me , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the first time in my life . That 's what made me start . " " Give up the shop ! " she cried out . " That 's what I want to do , " he said . " I give up the shop or give up my work . " " Your work ! " she said . " Are you crazy or what ? Here , " she said in a panic , " you 're kidding yourself . You 're not an artist . Not a real artist . " She waited for his answer , anxiously fixing her look upon him . He waited a long time before answering . He seemed to be clambering over obstacles , puffing and struggling to get to something that eluded him ; he failed . For he replied : " No . " " What ? " she said to be sure of it . " No , " he said . " I 'm not . " " Oh ! " she said . And then her argument died on her tongue . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him then and there . He had always been a boaster ? " Look what I 've done , " like a child . But his " no " shocked her . It was spoken in such a cold voice out of a frozen , obdurate , empty desolation . He might have been a castaway man , someone who has been put off alone on an ugly , landless sea . She felt an emotion that was half pity and half THE rage at this denial of himself . It was frightening to her , now , that he should agree with her and she said to soothe him after she had wounded him : " Are you going to draw the woman next door ? She asked you . You never offer to draw me . " " That old owl , " he said . " You said you hated being drawn . " " You never asked me , " she said . " Draw me  --  not my face . " Like artists do , " she said . " With nothing on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , " she said when she had taken off her clothes and sat on a chair . " This is not to be an excuse . The children will be back soon . " He was shy and uncertain . " A painter does n't think like that , " he said . " Move your arm back . He 's thinking of the composition . He 's thinking of beauty . " " You do n't love me , " she said . " Not like you used to in the shop . You wanted to draw me then . Now any woman would do . " I ca n't keep my arm like that all the time , " she said . " Just a moment , only a moment , " he said . It was terrible . The way his astonished eyes looked at her , how composed his astonishment was . The way he measured her , as though she was in some way wrong . Imagine what the neighbors would say . Suppose one of the children came in . He grunted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , suddenly talking , talking for the first time , as he drew . " Shut up with three children , always at the stove or at the sink . You do n't have a chance . I often think , " he said , " you never have a life , not to call it life . " Her lips straightened . " Go on telling me , " she said . " You need a rest , a change , " he said , measuring her shoulders with the pencil . " You do n't say , " she said , " and who 's going to give it me ? " And then she slowly came to see what it was that she hated about this painting of his . He had a life , a life she could n't share , a secret life she could not enter . Wonderfully kind he sounded  --  wonderfully kind , just like a man who is being unfaithful to you . Telling her . Telling her to go and have a life of her own . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You thank your stars , she said ( but not to him ) , I do n't go after a life of my own . A woman 's life is a man , a child , another person . If I had had a life of my own it would be another man . " Oh do n't move , " he said . If I had had a life of my own , as you have , it would be a man . She saw now clearly how it was with him : this painting was an infidelity . It was like another woman . She took a long breath . She smelled the sharp smell of the paint and she remembered what she had thought at once when she smelled it in the house : another woman was there . He was unfaithful to her . She got up without warning and covered herself with a vest . It humiliated her to sit before him . That is the situation now . Mr. Fred-MAGAZINE crick the manager has been to the house . He is a shy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unmarried . He is the kind of man who has to have some power and usually you see his kind standing for hours outside chicken runs at the end of a garden , fancying he is the cock . You can see he 's gone further with this husband of hers ; leads him round like a tame bear . The fool ! The enemy ! " Did n't I say he wished him no good ? " The idiot has bought one of her husband 's pictures for ten pounds . " Your husband is a born artist , " he says to her . " He needs time . He needs peace . He needs . . . He needs .. She can see he is dropping hints to her . What have they been saying about her ? She says nothing . She just hates Mr. Frederick . And yet  --  she ca n't understand why she does this , why she should enslave herself to this new mistress of his  --  she tiptoes to his room at dinnertime with a tray ; if he is working she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to disturb him , and goes out . She asks no questions . She makes no difficulties . She keeps the children away . And then , one of the children begins to sniff , the next one sniffs , and the third one sniffs louder ; she herself goes into the sitting room and sniffs again , sniffing round the walls . Where is it ? What has he done with it ? Has he brought it down yet  --  the new picture ?
