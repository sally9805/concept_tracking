Optimists who had forgotten that recent Allied advances were the payoff of a battle fought two months ago in Normandy were shocked last week to find the Germans putting up another fight . But the scare which the Wehrmacht threw into the Allies at Arnhem obscured the fact that last week was a bad week for the Wehrmacht . <P> Not only did the Germans lose two more campaigns-in the Baltic States and northern Italy-but on the western front they were fighting another battle which was going badly for them . <P> For at Arnhem , where the Allies had at stake the fate of perhaps 8,000 men , the Germans faced the loss of several times that number in western Holland , with the added prospect of having the Siegfried Line turned at its northern end , and the whole of north Germany laid open to invasion . At week 's end it appeared that the greater part of the Allied stake would be saved and the greater part of the German stake would be lost . <P> Meanwhile on the western front the impoverished Wehrmacht was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allies massed along the Siegfried Line it threw itself into local counterblows . In one area against Lieut . General George S. Patton 's Third Army it spent more than 200 tanks in such counterattacks . But , by this week , Patton 's armor had found a weak spot at another point , had plunged ahead six miles . <P> Against Lieut . General Courtney H. Hodges ' First Army , near Trier , enemy attacks pushed back one sharp wedge penetrating his " sacred soil . " But by this week General Hodges had turned this local German success into futility : the Americans had thrust farther north and east at another point , stood only 18 miles from the Rhine . <P> This was the same sort of wastage that the German Army suffered during the early days of the battle of Normandy . The Wehrmacht was now being reinforced by the old , the young , the deaf , the wounded ( only partially recuperated ) . Heinrich Himmler was organizing his home guards to back up the line . He also visited the front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them until killed or ordered to retreat . <P> Near Luxembourg the Allies found a purported Hitler staff document . It called on officers to save themselves at all costs : " An officer 's salvation in retreat is in the interests of the country . " ( Lately there has been a low percentage of officers among prisoners taken . ) There was other evidence that officer groups , cut off in Holland , were deserting their men , either to save themselves to lead an untried , last-ditch army of civilians and military misfits or to go underground to keep Naziism alive . <P> All this was disturbing to those who had hoped to see Germany fall without a fight . But for General Eisenhower , who was prepared to fight until Germany fell , it was good news . The enemy had been forced to take the measures of desperation-and already the battle of desperation had begun .
