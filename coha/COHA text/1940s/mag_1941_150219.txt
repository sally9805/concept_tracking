THE EARTH IS OURS-Whelm Moberg - Simon &; Schuster ( $2.75 ) . <P> Last week Swedish Novelist Vilhelm Moberg published a novel that was written with great earnestness , a restrained love of the Swedish countryside , an earthy knowledge of peasant types . In sheer acreage ( 687 pages ) The Earth Is Ours outbulked Knut Hamsun 's Growth of the Soil ( 406 pages ) . But Growth of the Soil told an ageless legend of a land-loving peasant 's conquest of and by the soil . The Earth Is Ours tells the story of a book-loving peasant 's efforts to reshape his native countryside along the lines of the more abundant life . <P> Knut Toring was a Swedish peasant boy who read so many books that his parents thought he must be a little crazy . As soon as he was big enough , Knut dashed off to Stockholm , made himself into an intellectual , eventually became editor of Leisure Hours , a Swedish Saturday Evening Post . But he insisted on giving his readers not what they wanted to read but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscriptions . This perversity among subscribers , trouble with his wife , and a revival of his feeling for the good earth finally split Editor Toring 's personality three ways . <P> So one day Knut Toring chucked his job , left his wife and children , went back to live in his native village . With overalled Betty Eskilsson , who announced that she had renounced the old trinity for a new one-nitrogen , calcium and superphosphate-Knut formed the Young People 's Society to keep peasant boys on the farm through cooperatives and communal culture . World War II was on the way before the Young People 's Society got its community clubhouse started , but the book ends with them digging away - a symbol of what Author Moberg thinks the post war world should look like . <P> Moberg 's peasants , working always in the soil , thinking in terms of generations - of plants , of animals , of themselves - feel that they are part of a never-ending process of creation , deriving from the past , foreshadowing the future . This feeling makes them crudely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nervous life and fidgety minds of cities . Knut Hamsun understood that being a peasant is not just a rural occupation , but a complete way of living and thinking , with which he sympathized . Moberg understands the peasant 's life too , but does not sympathize . He has ideas for the country side of the future . But Moberg the writer is too strong for Moberg the ideologue . Compared with his mean but strong and realistic peasants , there is a sloganeering and strength-through-joy unreality about Knut Toring 's Young People 's Society and their cooperative commonwealth . Both have high humanitarian motives , but they spring from the same cause that makes Knut a half-baked hero - as bookish boy , as self-righteous editor , as crusading cooperator , Knut is a good deal of a prig.
