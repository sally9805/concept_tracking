In Greece , perhaps to a greater extent than in any other country of occupied Europe , hunger is Hitler 's principal ally . From refugees , last week , came stories of the plight of those left behind : <P> &gt; As early as mid-September men and women fainting from hunger were a common sight in the streets of Athens , Salonika , Peiraeus . Bread , wheat and flour were the first commodities the Germans confiscated . Later they took tomatoes , sent them to Libya , where German troops were suffering from scurvy . Dried figs and raisins , now the staples of Greek diet , also are being commandeered , shipped to Germany . <P> &gt; There is plenty of money . The Germans see to that . Every Saturday night German printing presses are set up in the streets and German soldiers are paid in banknotes hot off the press . On one side the " value " of the banknote is printed ; on the other , a warning that refusal to accept the money is punishable by law . <P> &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look with contempt on the invaders . On a bus in Athens an Italian officer offered his seat to a Greek soldier with an amputated leg . Said the Greek : " I 'd rather stand than accept your kindness . " The Italian did not know what to do , but a German officer did . He arrested the Greek , took him to German headquarters , made him stand on his one leg for three hours , saluting every officer who entered or left . <P> &gt;Partitioning of Greece is foreshadowed by the deportation of thousands of Greeks from Thrace and Macedonia , by an influx of Bulgarians to occupy the abandoned homes and farms . <P> &gt; To a young woman who pleaded to be left one sack of potatoes after all the food in her house had been requisitioned , a German officer said politely : " I am sorry , but you must realize there are at present twice as many Greeks as we need here . Half must die . The rich shall become poor and the poor shall die . That is our policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your case . "
