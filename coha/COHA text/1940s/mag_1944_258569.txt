The ancient , tranquil towns of Provence stirred uneasily in the hot August sun . This year there were no vacationing Parisians on the beaches but a new wave of American tourists had arrived . Through the nodding summer countryside came the faint chatter of machine-gun fire , the roar of a big gun , the crack of a rifle . On dusty roads columns of tanks grumbled by , and above them fighter planes rode busily to work . <P> Warmed by the sun , cooled by the fierce , antiseptic mistral , favored by commerce and the sea , the land had bred a human race tolerant and amused . Now the Provencals joined in with the invaders to drive the German from their land . Along the shore among groves of cork oak , on the hills where pines tinged the air with the clean smell of resin , Frenchmen fought alongside the swiftly advancing troops of Major General Alexander M. ( for McCarrell ) Patch , U.S. commander of the Allied Seventh Army . <P> The town of Saint-Tropez , with tall pink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Mediterranean Fleet used to anchor on its annual vacation cruise , was captured by a parachute unit dropped there by mistake . In sun-drenched Hyres , where the girls are dark and Saracen and the streets are lined with palms , the Germans still held . Frjus , where Julius Caesar planted supplies for Gaul , was taken the first day . Saint-Raphael , a modest fishing village gone garish with the trappings of a modern coast resort , was quickly captured , too . But Cannes , its luxury hotels , meager beach , its dreams of gambling and fish , yachts and flowers still belonged to the Germans . <P> Oleander and Hyacinth . As the invasion entered its second week the Seventh was beyond such tactical baubles ; it was swooping out northwest and northeast at top speed . Already it had secured for its supply establishments a good portion of the Riviera land of pink oleander , grassy seaside terraces , garden walls , pastel villas , lush shrubbery , handsome estates , hyacinths , white beaches and mountain roads that hang like cornices over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing from southern France . <P> Bawdy , overcivilized Marseilles , a seaport that must be also won , was already outflanked ; Allied troops were less than nine miles away . The naval base at Toulon , with the tragic wreck of the French fleet rusting in its harbor , was under attack . Avignon , home of the Popes for 76 years , would soon feel the hot breath of war . Aix , heart of Provence , oldest Roman town in Gaul , was directly in the path of the pelting Allied army . The fourth front in Europe was proceeding not according to plan , but better . <P> Ships and Bombs . D-day was Aug. 15 . It began in cloudy night with a crescent moon shining fitfully through the overcast upon calm sea . Before the day was 30 minutes old the attack began with a commando landing on the Hyres Islands off Cap Bnat-where the now sunken French fleet used to take its exercise on sunny days . A few hours later more parachutists and gliders landed beyond the Monts des Maures - the Moorish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
