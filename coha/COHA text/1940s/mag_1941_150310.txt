Last week , as the U.S. sped work on its Caribbean rampart , from Bermuda to British Guiana , the U.S. Navy was busy on further defenses to the Panama Canal . While the first U.S. draft of soldiers for the Lend-Lease base in Bermuda shoved off from Brooklyn , Rear Admiral Frank H. Sadler , commanding the Fifteenth ( Canal Zone ) Naval District , told newsmen of growing dumps of supplies and equipment at Balboa , the great naval base on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal . <P> Protected by great stretches of blue water , Balboa is the heart of naval defense of the Canal , will need far-flung defenses if an enemy ever gets a foothold on the Pacific side of South America . It may need protection , even before that event , from harassing raids by enemy carriers or by long-range bombers , when factories begin producing raiders like Douglas Aircraft Co. ' s B-19 ( see p. 19 ) . <P> Against these still remote possibilities , Admiral Sadler told what the Navy is doing to extend its Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Navy light craft . Farthest flung will be Ecuador 's Galapagos Islands , astride the Equator , 1,000 miles from the Big Ditch . There , in a twelve-island archipelago fantastically storied as a haven for pirates and more modern escapists , Navy airmen will set up patrol bases , scan the Pacific to south , west and north . Another base will be set up 550 miles north of the Galapagos , on deserted Cocos Island , a favorite picnic stop of President Roosevelt 's , where treasure-hunting for buried pirate gold is the only industry . ( Costa Rica , the owner , now limits treasure-seeking parties to one at a time to avoid trouble . ) Third base will be in the Gulf of Fonseca on Honduras ' coast . The fourth will be far south , in one of the bays on the coast of friendly Ecuador . <P> How far arrangements for using these bases and listening posts have gone , the State Department would not say last week . But with the Navy already piling up equipment and getting ready to move it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors were getting ready to sign on the dotted line , if they had not already done so .
