Professor Edward L. Troxell , who is Connecticut 's State geologist and teaches geology at Hartford 's Trinity College , last week proudly exhibited the latest results of a lifetime spent thinking about rocks : a xylophone made of stone . The idea came to him on a trip through Virginia 's Shenandoah Caverns when his guide produced a beautiful , clanking tone by striking a stalactite across the middle . <P> Fired with enthusiasm , Professor Troxell started looking for resonant rocks , found an ideal deposit of them in a 200-million-year-old lava bed atop Avon Mountain near his home in Hertford . Toting a load of particularly clangorous cobbles home with him , Professor Troxell set them in a row , chipped them into tune with the aid of a chisel and a 10 pitch pipe . When he was through , he had a complete C Major scale three octaves long . <P> A stickler for scholarship , Professor Troxell realized he could n't call his rocky instrument a xylophone ( xylon is Greek for wood ) . After considering " lithophone " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petrophone . <P> No virtuoso , Petrophonist Troxell confines himself principally to scholarly renditions of such well-known compositions as Chopsticks , but occasionally rattles off a more ambitious classic . Says he : " People are impressed when I say I can play the Largo from Dvorak 's New World Symphony , but , you know , that is really very simple . "
