( See Cover ) <P> James Strom Thurmond , a Southern politician little known and therefore possibly underrated in the North , made a sortie last week into political no-man 's land . Appearing in Baltimore , in the border state of Maryland , he was met by a college student dressed in the full regalia of a Confederate brigadier and a mildly interested audience . Standing just over on his side of the Mason-Dixon line , the governor of South Carolina sounded his defiance of the " No'th . " <P> " Those who follow the banners of the States ' Rights Democrats , " he cried , " are determined that the evil forces which have seized control of the national party shall be cast out . The tides of that great party will flow like muddy water over the sands and rocks and be purified . The impurities of that party-Harry Truman and all his followers-will be deposited like sediment on the banks . " <P> There was every likelihood that J. Strom Thurmond would be an even smaller deposit of sediment than Harry Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not stand a chance in the world . He might capture as many as 50 electoral votes-next to Bull Mooser Theodore Roosevelt 's 88 in 1912 , the biggest block ever won by a third-party candidate . He was the result of Harry Truman 's political courage-or lack of political acumen . His appearance had marked the collapse of the compromises which had held the Democratic Party together for 16 years . <P> Symptom rather than symbol of the South 's revolt , Strom Thurmond was the South 's spokesman for an old , still smoldering issue . Thanks to Harry Truman , that issue had erupted again and was splitting the Solid South . The issue was black v. white . <P> The " Fo'ce Bills . " Candidate Thurmond would never admit that the issue could be put in such black &; white terms . He draped his case in the dialectics of states ' rights . In his harsh , flat voice he denied the authority of Washington to interfere with the South 's pattern of behavior . These were the " fo'ce bills " which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take from you the right to regulate your own elections . " <P> An anti-lynching law : " It would provide the opening wedge for federal control of your police powers . " <P> An anti-segregation law : " When will they learn , as the South has learned , that you can not legislate racial harmony ? " <P> An FEPC law : " It would force all business and business relationships into a Washington pattern guided and enforced by a federal Gestapo . " <P> But if it was states ' rights that Thurmond was battling for , what was the theoretical difference between him and a lot of Northern U.S. citizens who were equally apprehensive of Big Government ? The main front of the Dixiecrats , indeed , was a Southern upper crust of mill owners , oil men , tobacco growers , bankers , lawyers , who might have felt more comfortable voting Republican . Would the Dixiecrat party be a kind of political decompression chamber for conservative Southerners , on their way to the Republican party ? No ; for Tom Dewey also advocated civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rights with a significant difference .
