AVIATION Comeback for National <P> In a walnut-paneled room in Washington , the Civil Aeronautics Board opened preliminary meetings last week to see if National Airlines , Inc. should be put out of business . The case for dismemberment was strong last year : hit by a ten months ' strike and hurt by CAB 's grounding of all DC-6s , National lost almost half its passenger traffic , turned in a $1,946,041 deficit in 1948 . But last week , National 's President George T. ( " Ted " ) Baker was hardly acting like a man who expected to shut up shop . He announced that he would launch a new , luxury " Star " flight from New York to Miami this week , in all-out competition against Eddie Rickenbacker 's Eastern Air Lines , Inc . <P> National 's " Star " passengers will get the full red-carpet treatment , starting with a carpet on the loading ramp and recorded music at take-offs and landings . The specially decorated DC-6s will seat 56 people and will have a lounge ( Eastern 's smaller Constellations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh flowers in the planes every day , and such features as hot hors d'oeuvres and linen napkins . Fares will be no higher than on other DC-6 flights . <P> While all this hoopla was an obvious attempt to highlight the austere handling Eastern gives its passengers , President Baker feels that it is also symbolic of the comeback of his airline . With his labor troubles settled , he has pulled his operating costs per revenue ton mile down to 36.44 , but according to CAB , they 're still above Eastern . Although National wound up fiscal 1949 last June with a piddling $38,963 profit , it earned $866,000 in the last six months of that year , thanks partly to a big boost in mail pay over 1948 . On the expectation of continued profits he is buying two new DC-6s and arranging for the lease of three more four-engined planes . When all are in service next year , National will have 14 four-engined aircraft in operation , competing with Rickenbacker 's Constellations . <P> National is still a long way from a happy landing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to final hearings on dissolving National , probably not until next year , National 's comeback will have made the question academic .
