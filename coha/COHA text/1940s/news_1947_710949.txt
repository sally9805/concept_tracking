Eleven , most of them acceptable to the Foreign Affairs Committee , were adopted. , The chief of these provi'ded the fol-lowing : The recipient governments must ' agree that no persons or organizations embracing or formerly embracing communism be permittedl to distribute the food , fuel or other essentials of the program . None of the relief commodities shall be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even after ' the program gets under way , domi nated by Communists or the Soviet Republic . This clause was admittedly a trigger which would terminate American relief the minute such a condition was recognized by the President of the United States . In the debate today there were denunciations of the ' program as one contributing " blank checks " to " futile " enterprises abroad and warnings that the freedom not only of the United States but of the world was at stake . Representative Sam Rayburn of Texas , former Speaker , recalled that at times in 1945 the war cost the United States $500,000,000 a day . He assailed an amendment , by Representative Lawrence H. Smith of Wisconsin , a Republican of the Foreign Affairs Committee ; to cut the relief to $500,000,000 . House majority leaders had predicted that this amendment would be adopted and some of them voted for it . Mr. Rayburn , as minority leader , had Democrats on hand to support him in the voting . He called a $590,000,000 authorization " a contribution to freedom and a maintained peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamble , since real peace had not yet come despite the end of the shooting in World War II . Leading the other side in the debate was Representative Dewey Short , Republican , of Missouri , who declared that the program was more likely to promote ill will than good will . He asserted that the American relief commodities would not reach those for whom they were intended and that " money will not buy friends . " " The more you give people , " he said , " the more they will curse you for not giving them more . Instead of bleeding ourselves white we should be making ourselves stronger , building up the defenses of America . " When the floor time of Mr. Short was up Republicans proposed that it be extended . Representative Mary T. Norton , Democrat , of New Jersey , objected . Mr. Short made his exit , telling the chair : " I have no desire , sir , to cast my pearls before swine .

Representative Chester E. Merrow , Republican , of New Hampshire , also a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee , proposed that the authorization be increased to $661,000,000 , saying that this would meet the full $597,000,00 recommended for Western Europe by the Administration and the $60,000,000 for China . The amount above these sums would represent money to replace funds which it had been planned to use for the new relief program but which were found to be unavailable or unnecessary .

To expedite the starting of the program the House voted down with a roar an amendment by Mr. Smith to kill the Foreign Affairs Committee proposal that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation be authorized to advance up to $150,000,000 as soon as the program authorization was enacted . This device , it was brought out , had saved months in past aid and relief programs while the Senate and House Appropriations Committees were studying the actual appropriations . The House will meet two hours earlier than usual tomorrow and a deciding vote during the day seemed assured . To expediate final action the Senate appointed managers for the bill . These managers- can go to conference at any time to adjust differences between Senate ' and House versions . It was predicted that the bill would go to conference Friday . Congressional leaders expressed hope ' for final passage late this week or early next week .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
