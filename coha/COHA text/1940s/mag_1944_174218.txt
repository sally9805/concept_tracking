In winter the North Atlantic airway to Europe is no " milk run . " Hurricane winds blow over desolate wastes of water . The bases are often closed in by sudden storms . Moisture-laden air can sheathe a plane in ice . With magnificent understatement , airmen used to say the route was " unreliable . " <P> But this week the Air Transport Command 's North Atlantic division , in ceremonies at bases from Maine to Iceland , will mark the opening of its second winter of regularly scheduled operations . A flight to Europe , winter or summer , is now as routine an operation as a hop from New York to San Francisco . <P> He Proved His Point . The man who runs this airway is tough , gruff Brigadier General Lawrence G. Fritz , onetime operations vice president for the T.W.A. When he was A.T.C. 's operations chief in Washington , he used to assert : " The North Atlantic . . . can be flown both east and west on regular schedule in winter as well as summer . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a B24 , flew it out into the North Atlantic seeking the worst weather " front " that he could find . His plane picked up a load of ice , lost flying speed and dropped into a spin . Fritz , a veteran airline pilot , straightened her out just a few hundred feet from the water . He came back still convinced that he was right . He was handed the job of proving his point as C.O. of the North Atlantic Division . <P> In the winter of 1943-44 the division flew more traffic over the Atlantic than in the whole summer of 1942 . Traffic is up to more than 40 crossings a day . Last month more passengers , cargo and mail moved over the Army 's North Atlantic run than during any month last summer ( except during the period immediately before and after the invasion ) . <P> The Lonely Men . Larry Fritz was too old and too precise a hand to try to beat the North Atlantic by pounding across by guess and by God . <P> The weather hazard was beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weather stations were set up-53 of them - and radio communications were installed to get their observations to the forecasters . The network is operated by officers who learned their job in the operations end of the U.S. airlines . The stations are manned by thousands of G.I.s . <P> Their reports , radioed from barren rocks and cliffside perches , now enable the " weather busters " of the A.T.C. to forecast the weather across the North Atlantic mile by mile , almost hour by hour . The communications network , radio ranges and home beacons shepherd the transports and the bombers across . The great bases at Labrador , Newfoundland , Greenland , Iceland and the Azores provide refueling , maintenance and sometimes havens . <P> Crossroads of the Atlantic . On the North Atlantic division the A.T.C. is doing two jobs : 1 ) maintaining and flying the transport route to Europe for high priority passengers , mail and freight ; 2 ) guiding the fleets of bombers direct into the European theater.                 @ @ @ @
