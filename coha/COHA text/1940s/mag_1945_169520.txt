Since the liberation , French tennis stars of the gay , bygone days have been creeping back in the news . ( Notable exception : flamboyant Jean Borotra , last reported under arrest as Vichy 's ex-Sports Director . ) This week Yvon Petra , a native of Indo-China , captured the French championship by defeating former Davis Cupper Bernard Destremeau , 7-5 , 6-4 , 6-2 . Then dapper little Henri Cochet , 45-year-old ace of the ' 20s , paired with Pierre Pellizza to win the doubles crown from Petra and Destremeau.
