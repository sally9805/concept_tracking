Almost any topnotch businessman could have qualified for the big title and the $65,000-a-year salary just by getting along with The Boss .

Quick to catch on , he was named assistant secretary within three weeks , secretary in less than a year and a half .

Ball , a big ( 6 ft. 2 in. ) man with a smooth courtroom manner , saw Avery safely through his many scrapes with NLRB-including the one that led to the U.S. Army 's wartime eviction of Avery and Government seizure of his plant . <P> When President Ball took over his new office last week , Chairman Avery sent him a bunch of roses with a note : " With affection and confidence .
