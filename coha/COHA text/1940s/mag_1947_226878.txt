As a comradely service to its readers , Manhattan 's Communist Daily Worker last week swiped an idea from the class enemy and for once gave him credit for it . The Worker " noticed " that a " firm of ' liberals ' " had offered industrialists advice on " how to detect Communists in industry . " Columnist Ted Tinsley submitted his own tips on " How to Detect Capitalists in Your Industry " : <P> " Do n't expect to find the capitalist in your shop . . . . Look for him on the golf course . It is there that he will tell you that without him , the industry could not function . <P> " He never comes before you and says , ' I am a capitalist . ' He works through various ' front ' organizations : large sections of the Republican and Democratic Parties , the ' free ' press , the N.A.M. , the State Department , and others . <P> " Watch out for the fellow who tells you that you , individually , are free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a trap . Do not try to manufacture steel ... <P> " Examine the suspect 's hands for callouses . . . but this is not conclusive ... If his heart is calloused , he 's your man . " In short , the woods were full of them , and a Communist could n't be too careful . A point the Worker did not mention : what to do with the capitalist after he was tracked down .
