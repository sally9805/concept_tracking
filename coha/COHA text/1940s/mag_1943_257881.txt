A description of the way some 75 war correspondents in North Africa live came last week from Ernie Pyle , Scripps-Howard reporter now in Tunisia . Wrote he : <P> " Each of the three big press associations has a five-man staff-usually three men back at headquarters and two at the front . They rotate every few weeks . The correspondents in the city . . . live in hotels or apartments , eat at restaurants or officers ' messes , work regular hours . . . . <P> " The outstanding thing about life at the front is its magnificent simplicity . It is a life consisting only of the essentials-food , sleep , transportation , and what little warmth and safety you manage to wangle . . . . At the front the usual responsibilities and obligations are gone . You do n't have appointments to keep . Nobody cares how you look . . . . You have no desk , no designated hours . You do n't wash your hands before you eat , or afterwards either . . . . Your whole system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . <P> " It is a life that gives you a new sense of accomplishment . . . . You have a feeling of vitality . You are in the heart of everything . . . . There is an exhilaration in war ; an inner excitement that builds up into a buoyant tenseness which is seldom achieved in peacetime . . . . "
