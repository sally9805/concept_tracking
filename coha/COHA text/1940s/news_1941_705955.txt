txt A clash between Republican and Democratic members as the House Foreign Affairs Committee ? heard opponents of revision of the Neutrality Act and a meeting at which eleven **Isolationist Senators laid plans to oppose the arming of merchant ships were today 's chief developments in the battle over the Administration 's current efforts to render more aid to Great Britain . Before the House committee opponents of President Roosevelt 's foreign policy called on him to keep all anti-aircraft and anti-submarine guns off merchant ships , keep seamen out of the danger zones and use his influence to bring about an immediate peace between Britain and the Axis powers . Representative Bloom of New York , who was accused , as committee chairman , of limiting the hearings so as to speed the passage of the Administration 's - amendment to the Neutrality Act , predicted that the House Would authorize the arming of merchant vessels on Friday . Some Administration supporters indicated that an attempt would he made in the Senate not only to strike out Article VI of the act , which forbids the arming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevents merchant vessels from going into the ports of Great Britain . The meeting of the ' eleven noninterventionist Senators was held in the office of Senator Johnson . In addition to the Californian , the group comprised Senators Wheeler , Taft , Gillette , La Follette , Clark of Idaho and Clark of Missouri , Walsh , Nye , Vandenberg and Capper . The opposition Senators were unanimous in insisting there would be no filibuster . Senator La Follette said there should be " full debate " but ' no blocking of a final vote . Senator Wheeler denied reports that the isolationist group was heading toward a split . The hearing before the House committee began with an angry exchange between Republican and Democratic members ' . Chairman Bloom condemned the Republicans for attempting to boycott the hearing and refusing to perform their normal duties of arranging for witnesses to Present the opposition . He was challenged by Representative Vorys , who led the Republican opposition when Representatives Fish and Tinkham refused to attend . Mr. Vorys tried to read into the record the minority protest against limiting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passed a motion that the hearing go into executive session . When the hearing was openeti to the press half an hour later , Mr. Vorys said he had not been able to get his protest into the record and Mr. Bloom announced that ; the committee was prepared to hear in open session any of the opposition witnesses who had asked for time to oppose the bill . Only three witnesses appeared , John F. Finerty , representing the Keep America Out of War Congress of New York and the National Council for the Prevention of War of Washington ; Frederick J. Libby , executive secretary of the National Council for the Prevention of War , and Mary W. Hillyer , executive director of the Keep America Out of War Congress . Mr. Finerty asserted that the Administration 's foreign policy was neither frank , dignified nor honest ; predicted that the arming of merchantmen would " condemn our seamen to sudden death without warning " and suggested that the United States could give far more aid to the Allies by turning over to Great Britain and British crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States arms to Britain . If the United States insisted on putting guns on merchant ships , German U-boat commanders would not be required by interna- ' tional law to go to the surface " and risk destruction " to discover whether such ships were armed , but could fire on them legitimately from beneath the surface . Mr. Finerty stated that originally he had wanted the United States to ban the shipment of arms to everybody , but he was now forced by events to the conclusion that this nation should try to give material aid to Britain and her Allies . It was a mistake to think that complete delivery of arms to the British could be made without a declaration of war , which , he contended , the American people , would repudiate even if it were made by Congress . The arming of American merchant vessels would not assure the needed delivery . Sui ; nmarizing his position after two and a half hours of cross questioning , Mr. Inerty said he did not like the Nazis . He believed Mr. Roosevelt 's aims were honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort by the Administration to bring about a negotiated peace . He was convinced that the United States could not bring about the defeat of Hitler by materiel alone ; that the nation 's people would protest against trying to starve out ' Germany , and that the end of the present policy was the sending of millions of men to Europe to fight against the Axis powers . Britain should sue for a , peace now while her empire was intact and she had the support of the United States . The occupied countries and downtrodden Jews stolid a setter chance of getting freedom now at the conference table than they would several years from now on the battle field . Miss Hillyer complained of the Administration 's attempt to " gag " the opposition . It was futile for the committee to hear the testimony of members of the President 's Cabinet . " You should start listening to the little people of this country , " she said . She maintained that the Administration was asking for the arming of merchant ships merely because it could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive war .
