CHANCES are that you have never seen any beryllium , yet you probably have some occasion to use it every day . You take the jobs it does for granted , but they make a big difference in your comfort , safety , and pocketbook . Because of beryllium your new vacuum cleaner will last four to five times as long as the old one . The same is true of your mechanical refrigerator and the thermostat control on your furnace . To get that picture of Junior mid-air in the pole vault you had to use a shutter speed of one thousandth of a second ; you can rely on such precision because of a tiny beryllium-copper spring in your camera . We think of the properties of a metal as being eternal . But all metals , under strain , get tired . The mainspring of your watch gets tired , for example , and the watch loses time . In industry , metal fatigue is a serious problem . When some single part fails , the wheels of an entire factory may be stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher speeds . This makes it urgent that we have at every vital point in industry some metal ? particularly for springs and intricate parts ? that will hold up under increasing stresses . Beryllium-copper , for all practical purposes , is tireless . The endurance of any metal can be tested by an ingenious machine which  | in effect depresses the piece and lets it spring back to its original position . The number of times it will spring back without breaking indicates its resistance to fatigue . Spring steel will stand 3,000,000 vibrations , under salt spray . Beryllium-copper will take at least a billion before it breaks . That is why virtually all new aviation instruments have beryllium-copper in them ? to give them permanent accuracy under the toughest possible conditions . The new altimeters depend on an activating beryllium-copper diaphragm , as tireless as it is sensitive to the slightest change in atmospheric pressure . Modern aviation can not get along without beryllium . Consider the Sperry robot pilot . The robot detects each variation up or down , right or left , in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controls that actuate rudder , ailerons , and elevators much as your nerves transmit impulses to your muscles . It corrects the plane 's course more quickly than a human brain could react . And , unlike a human brain , it never loses efficiency through fatigue . The robot pilot is built around two spinning gyroscopes , each turning over thousands of times per minute . Each of the bearings on which they turn is gripped by four springs ; spaced like the spokes of a wheel . If one of those springs got tired , if it lessened its tension by so much as one two-thousandth of an inch , the rotor which it holds in place would stop dead . The instant that happened , the pilot would have to take over the controls and fly his 350-milean-hour bomber by hand . But today the pilot no more worries about that than you do about what 's inside the gadget that keeps your refrigerator at a set temperature . The springs of the gyroscopes ? in common with over 100 parts of the modern transport and bomber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds , in hospitals , laboratories , factories , electric power plants , and on ships at sea make use of springs and diaphragms similar to those in aviation instruments . One mechanical bookkeeper used in many large business houses has 15,000 small springs ? all made of beryllium-copper . The metal is beginning to be used in automobile manufacture , radio , electric motors ? whenever there are higher speeds or exceptional strains . Yet this metal baffled metallurgists for a whole generation . Twenty years ago , two groups of metallurgists began experimenting with beryllium . In 1921 Charles F. Brush , son of the man who invented the electric arc lamp , opened a laboratory in Cleveland with C. Baldwin Sawyer , just back from Massachusetts Institute of Technology bearing a brand-new doctor 's degree . Maurice D. Sarbey and Hugh S. Cooper , both employed by the Union Carbide &; Carbon Company , also began working with beryllium . Beryllium had been discovered as a chemical element in 1797 . Now it was noised about that beryllium was more than a footnote in high-school texts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal one-third lighter than aluminum , yet harder than steel . The country , just crawling painfully out of a depression , was ripe for miracle stories . Cleveland 's newspaper row heard about beryllium . Reporters rushed out to Cooper 's laboratory to witness the new miracle . Typewriters began to make frantic ballyhoo . In a machine age such an unheard-of combination of lightness and hardness suggested boundless possibilities . The new wonder metal was expected to set the wheels of factories humming on a new industrial age . But things do n't happen fast in metallurgy . Beryllium proved temperamental . True , it was both amazingly light and hard . But in spite of its hardness under steady pressure , it was brittle under an impact . It would shatter like glass when dropped . Metallurgists , fearing that a metal so brittle would never be of much use by itself , tried combining it with other light metals ? aluminum , for instance . But beryllium was finicky . With aluminum it made a fragile alloy that could not even be rolled without breaking . Miraculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled with beryllium 's tricky properties . Then a young Tennessee Irishman , Andrew J. Gahagan , got stirred up over the metal . His interest had begun during his undergraduate days at Columbia University . Afterwards he worked his way through the Ford Motor Company , acquiring on the assembly line and later on the side of management a first-hand knowledge of modern industry . His imagination was touched by everything he heard about beryllium . Like a Paul Bunyan he crashed through the forests of finance , and with some of the resilience and tirelessness of the meta he was to develop , he spread everywhere the story of beryllium 's future . Confidently Gahagan bought up existing patents and began sending engineers throughout the country to examine deposits of beryllium ore . To carry on the necessary experimental work he engaged as chief metallurgist J. Kent Smith , who as a young man had worked with Madame Curie . In a small laboratory at Detroit , Smite and Gahagan carried on their experiments through a long series of baffling failures Each new alloy developed kinks and quirkall its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tried combining beryllium in various proportions with almost everything they could think of . After about two years of work , they made a startling discovery . When a small amount of beryllium ( two percent ) had been added to copper . copper could be hardened by heat treatment as steel is hardened . In the laboratory of a copper company they hoped to interest in their discovery . Gahagan and Smith watched their alloy tested for tensile strength . The needle on the indicator of the testing machine climbed higher and higher . It passed the normal figure for brass , for bronze , for stainless steel , for almost every known material . It did not snap until the needle rose to show a tensile strength of 185,000 pounds per square inch ! In everyday language , the story told by that machine was this : a rod half an inch in diameter , if made of beryllium copper , would lift a weight of 20 tons ! Next they tested the hardness of their new alloy bu setting a disk of beryllium copper on top of a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beryllium in it . They placed the copper and the steel between the jaws of a giant hydraulic press . Under 400 tons pressure , not the copper but the steel gave way . The copper disk , absolutely unharmed , was embedded in the softer steel ! Beryllium had graduated from the laboratory at last . There would be plenty of jobs for a metal that would do what no other material could do . Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney became interested , putting up the first part of what was to be a $545,000 investment . Gahagan began refining beryllium from ore and producing beryllium-copper . At first he sold his product through copper companies . Later , as business increased  | and the copper companies beame jealous of the new alloy , e moved the Beryllium Corporaon plant from Detroit to Reading , Pa. , and began making beryllium copper for aviation companies and other customers and turning out finished tools of his own . He added the German patents to those he had already acquired and , just before the present war broke out , brought from Germany valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also devised a good many methods of his own ; one operation which still takes the Germans 17 hours an be done at Reading in two . Time and experiment revealed that beryllium-copper had other useful qualities besides its strength . In oil refineries , grain elevators , and munitions plants , where iron tools rasping against a steel shaft might strike a spark and cause a fatal explosion , workers use hammers , chisels , shovels , and hand tools of berylliumtopper . In scores of odd places it is important that the metals used be nonmagnetic . Steel buckles on parachute harness often set a plane 's magnetic compass askew , so they are now using beryllium-copper buckles instead . Equally in machines that must work in a damp atmosphere , or near salt or other corrosive chemicals , beryllium-copper is useful because it will not rust or corrode . Nothing else will take so much all-around punishment . As  | an experiment , a European manufacturer made a watch entirely of beryllium alloys . That watch was dropped 3,000 feet from an airplane . When picked up it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malleable until it is hardened by heat treatment . It can be rolled , forged , cast , or stamped into almost any useful shape . After that it can be hardened so that it will hold its shape permanently . This curious quality is of infinite interest to the War Department . Every part of the firing mechanism of every gun , big or little , is made of steel . Every one of those parts must be rough cast , then machined and polished down to the finished form . But make a casting of soft metal , then harder . it . Little polishing or machining is needed . and you save billions of man hours for national defense . An American ordnance company recently demonstrated this . A new-model signal flash gun had to be built for the British Army . To design and construct the first model of any gun always takes months , often years . The parts of the gun were cast in beryllium copper , and the entire job was finished in two months ! Yet even this does not begin to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an alloy , the pure metal itself has vast possibilities . Experiments are in progress at the Brush Beryllium Company and elsewhere to determine if the brittleness of the metal is inherent or may be due to certain minute impurities . The pure metal is transparent to X rays , and is used for windows in X-ray machines . Physicists use it for targets in their atomsmashing apparatus . Beryllium salts have important uses . The tube of your fluorescent lamp ? the closest thing to sunlight man has produced ? is coated with beryllium oxide . So is the magic screen of the new television sets . And Dr. Sawyer has discovered that , when firing kilns are lined with bricks made of beryllium silicate instead of ordinary brick , the beryllium in some mysterious way imparts strength to china . When two years ago the public learned through Congressional hearings how important beryllium is to national defense , rumors began to spread of an impending shortage and of fabulous riches to be gained by discovering a deposit . But though the supply is not limitless and a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of beryllium in the earth 's crust . Most of it is in the Western Hemisphere . Beryllium is made chiefly from beryl , a species of precious stone that includes the emerald . You can see beryl crystals in almost any museum . You can recognize them by their typical six-sided shape and their cloudy but delicate tints of rose , pink . or blue . Often they are quite long , sometimes as much as 14 feet . Smaller crystals have been picked up in New York 's Central Park and larger ones have been quarried a Mount Kisco , near New York . In availability of the raw material , this country is better situated than any other . The ore occurs in what geologists call pegmatite dikes , along with feldspar an : mica . It is to be found in scattered localities on the eastern seaboard from Maine to Georgia , in North and South Dakota , Utah . Wyoming , Nevada , California , New Mexico . and Arizona . It is mined only in Colorado . but in a number of places it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beryl in interesting quantities . We import over 1,000 tons annually from these countries . They used to supply Germany before the war . Now Germany has to depend on a single deposit in Austria ? a little-advertised reason for the Anschless . But there are abundant supplies in Russia 's Ural Mountains . Beryllium is still expensive . The small amount handled and the cost of reducing it keeps the price high . As beryllium : takes over more and more of the work o : industry it will unquestionably come down as it has already come down from $200 t , $15 per pound since 1929 . With greater efficiency both at mine and factory , experts say it can be produced in quantities at between $1.40 and $2.70 per pound . Beryllium production doubled in 1940 and again this year . The entire field of research in this metal holds latent marvels . Today , for instance . beryllium is used chiefly with copper . But beryllium-nickel has all the properties of beryllium-copper in far greater degree . Germany is far ahead of this country in the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical difficulties to overcome . So beryllium , tireless worker of silent miracles , still has its future ahead of it . What surprises that future may hold can no more be imagined than Fulton could have visualized an airplane operated from the ground by radio .  |
