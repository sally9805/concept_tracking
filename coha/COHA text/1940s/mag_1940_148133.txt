No. 3 man in the German hierarchy , after the heads of State and Army , is the country 's mouthpiece . In title and theory , Propaganda Minister Paul Joseph Goebbels holds this position . But the Goebbels ' star has fallen so far since the signing of the German-Russian pact that another man is rapidly moving into his spot . The usurper 's official title is Reich Organization Director , Leader of the Labor Front ; but as he moves towards No. 3 , he becomes , more &; more , spokesman of Nazi doctrine , utterer of slogans , salesman of ideas . The unfortunate pronunciation of his name is the same as of the English word " lie . " <P> Robert Ley is one of the more radical oldtimers of the Nazi Party . He organized the Party into its prison-model machinery of blocks , cells , wardens . When the Nazis came to power in 1933 , he was made head of the Labor Front , proceeded forcibly to liquidate the free trade unions , numbering 4,000,000 members . In his ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday and Billy Rose . He staged the vast Nrnberg Party rallies each year , and built the " Strength Through Joy " organization , which mass-produced recreation , playgrounds , loyalty-all convertible for war uses . <P> All this while Robert Ley tossed out pronouncements which tended to set him up as a second-string oracle . When the Party wanted discipline , he ranted against nicotine , alcohol and debauchery ( despite his own proclivity for liquor , generously indulged on " Strength Through Joy " outings ) . When Germany needed manpower , he lectured the Many Children League on that " natural , healthy " phenomenon , illegitimacy ( see col. 2 ) . When Lebensraum ( living space ) and the Communist menace were in the air , he proclaimed : " In Germany 147 men have to live on one square kilometre-in Russia only nine . This may be borne for a time by superhuman effort , but not forever . " When vilification of Britain was in order , he was among the loudest and most insistent , branding the enemy " a dark smudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " a rich parvenu wishing to play world policeman . " <P> Last week Nazi Germany came right out and declared its intention not only to beat Great Britain but to dominate the world , and it was Robert Ley who made the declaration . The theory of Germanic superiority lies at the nub of Nazi doctrine , was the hypothesis of Mein Kampf . But until last week no responsible German had ever talked right out for the world to hear about Germany 's heaven-given right to rule . Dr. Ley did . In a speech in conquered Lemberg , German Poland , he said : <P> " We know the issue ; it is to be or not to be . But we also know that Germany will live . For England is already blockaded . The country that wants to starve us is itself shut up like a mouse in a trap . We want to be hard in this war . We are going to forget the arch-evil , our good nature , and will be hard and relentless in battling for our demands . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher rights than all others . A German laborer is worth more than an English lord . We have the divine right to rule , and we shall assure ourselves of that right . "
