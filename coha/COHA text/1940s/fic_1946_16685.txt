1 NEW YORK SKYSCRAPER ( TODAY ) FADE IN SHOOTING UP . CAMERA PANS DOWN , the SOUNDS of the street growing louder , CAMERA HOLDS ON a New York mounted policeman . As he starts down the street marking parked cars , CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS sidewalk . It is bright and clear  --  the afternoon of a spring day  --  a sense of lighthearted excitement in the air . Pedestrians wear spring clothes , walk with brisk enjoyment of the day . . . CAMERA MOVES IN to a subway kiosk . People pour up from below , flowing around camera . Susan and Bill have just come up the street and pause at one side of the kiosk as CAMERA FINDS them . Susan has just turned her back . She wears a sheer dress of bright print that she bought especially for Bill return . Bill is a Technical Sergeant . His uniform is GI and has been changed since issued only in the addition of ribbons  --  one for Tunisia and one for France . &nbsp; SUSAN ( nervously ) I 'd better leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks down , is n't it ? &nbsp; BILLYeah , I think so . He starts to search through his pockets . &nbsp; SUSANI 'm supposed to meet Martha . I promised I 'd help her with her packing . He 's tapped all of his pockets , and now starts to go through them . &nbsp; SUSAN ( cont 'd ) ( tentatively ) Unless , of course . . . you 'd like me to come with you ? He smiles at her and shakes his head . His searching becomes more frantic . &nbsp; SUSAN ( cont 'd ) ( very tentative ) I 'd like to . ( she 'd like to , very much )  --  3  --  &nbsp; SUSAN ( softly ) You got into some bad habits in the Army . Bill stops , laughs , puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently on the cheek . &nbsp; BILL ( murmurs ) Baby . &nbsp; SUSANGood luck , honey . And do n't worry about it . You 'll get it all right . &nbsp; BILL ( confident ) Sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she goes . As Susan leaves the SHOT , CAMERA STAYS ON Bill , and it 's evident that he is worried . He pulls a brown postcard from his pocket , glances at it and starts down the street . As he passes in front of the kiosk , he bumps into a sailor who has come up from below , and is standing , consulting the same brown postcard as Bill's. 2 BILL AND THE SAILOR &nbsp; BILLSorry . They realize they have the same kind of card . &nbsp; BILL ( cont 'd ) I think it 's this way . He starts down the street and the sailor falls in at his side . The sailor glances at Bill 's ribbons . &nbsp; SAILORBeen home long ? &nbsp; BILLGoing on two months . I was finishing a furlough when the discharge came through . How about you ? &nbsp; SAILORAbout three weeks .  --  4  --  He does n't hear her , he 's busy searching . &nbsp; SUSAN ( cont 'd ) Bill ! What 're you looking for ! &nbsp; BILLMy card !

She gives it to him guiltily . She watches as he verifies that it 's the right one . He reads some additional writing on it with interest . &nbsp; BILL ( reading ) " A loaf of bread . . . quart of milk . . . . and vegetables , not peas " . . . . . . ( accusingly ) Grocery list , huh ? &nbsp; SUSAN ( grinning ) Yeah . He smiles at her fondly . &nbsp; SUSAN ( cont 'd ) Well . . . . . . goodbye , honey . &nbsp; BILL'bye . He starts to go , Susan pulls him back .  --  5  --  There is the SOUND of a crowd , a babble of talk and exclamation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards some focus of attention ahead of them . . . A small boy runs past them , stops to look off . &nbsp; BOY ( shrilly ) Joey , lookit ! Lookit ! Joey overtakes him and they both run past camera . Bill and the sailor look off to see the center of attention and walk to the curb , CAMERA MOVING AHEAD of them , to include part of the crowd that has gathered around whatever is causing the excitement and comment . Bill tries to see over the heads of the people in front of them . He taps a tall man on the shoulders . &nbsp; BILLWhat is it ? &nbsp; TALL MAN ( not turning ) One of the new cars . . . Bill and the sailor climb to the bumper of a car parked at the curb and look over the heads of the crowd . &nbsp; BILLSure did n't take ' em long . . . &nbsp; SAILORYou said it . &nbsp; BILLSlick job , too . . . &nbsp; SAILORI 'm goin ' to get me one of those ! &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand and gets to the sidewalk , the sailor following . They start to cross the street - CAMERA LIFTS - Bill and the sailor walk in front of a streetcar that stops to let passengers alight . A soldier swings to the ground , consults a card that he pulls from his breast-pocket , and starts across the street in the same direction as Bill and the sailor . The streetcar starts forward as a bus pulls in to the far corner and a couple of marines get off and start down the street in the same direction as the others . DISSOLVE OUT DISSOLVE IN  --  6  --  3 SIDEWALK Bill and the sailor come down the sidewalk side by side . Behind them , making their way against the flow of pedestrians , come the other servicemen . Bill and the sailor stop in front of a building . They read the lettering across its front . CAMERA PANS TO a glass front backed by venetian blinds . Across the glass in golden letters : UNITED STATES EMPLOYMENT SERVICE The reflection of Bill and the sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusts his hat . The sailor adjusts his tie . They start past camera toward door . As they go through door , CAMERA RISES TO TRANSOM OVER door , MOVING THROUGH . . . Bill and the sailor pause for a moment inside the office - SOUND of voices , some laughter , typewriters - then make their way to a lineup in front of the long counter near the elevators . This is a LONG SHOT . We get the atmosphere of the first floor of 87 Madison Avenue . The information counter is too far away from the camera to hear dialogue and in the f.g . are civilians and veterans leaving the place and we hear some appropriate dialogue . In the b.g. we see some of the men at the information desk leaving there and entering the elevator . They have only been there a brief moment as Bill will be . As they enter the elevator we DISSOLVE 4 FOURTH FLOOR - 87 MADISON AVENUE In the f.g . is a sign reading " Veterans - Information . " OVER SHOT Bill 's voice quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . CAMERA MOVES DOWN to show Bill standing before one of the two information desks placed side by side . In the b.g. are the elevators . The girl at the desk is handing a set of forms to a veteran and to Bill . &nbsp; GIRLName ? &nbsp; BILLWilliam Cummings . He watches as she writes it down . &nbsp; GIRLYour discharge paper . He shows it to her . She glances at it and hands it back . She is obviously very efficient and this procedure is accomplished with great speed .  --  7  --  &nbsp; GIRLWhat kind of work have you done ? &nbsp; BILLI 'm a turret lathe operator . The veteran , who has been patiently standing by , breaks in . &nbsp; VETERANLook , lady , I have been filling out forms for four years . What I want is a job and there 's no use in filling out any more unless I know I 'm going to get one . &nbsp; GIRL ( kindly ) We ca n't help you until you fill out the forms . &nbsp; VETERAN ( repeats ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl hands Bill the same form . &nbsp; GIRLTake this over there , please , and fill it out . Bill has been watching the exchange of dialogue between veteran and girl . The same attitude , the same question was on his lips . Now he takes the form and starts toward the desk . As he comes toward the desk , we see a few civilians and veterans all filling out forms , some with great rapidity , some making no progress whatsoever . There is the atmosphere of people treading water . There is no quality of eagerness  --  it seems as though the idea of the forms has dashed cold water on whatever expectations the individuals had when they came in . Bill , too , seems to have his mind anywhere but on the form as he sets it down in front of him and grimly start to look it over . The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE to Bill as we hear his voice narrating . &nbsp; BILL 'S VOICEForms. . . forms . . . forms  --  I need a job and a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , kid , take a look .

Does n't that make a difference . . . . how bad a guy might want a job or how well he 'd do it if he had one , Forms . . . forms . . . forms . . . It 's not what 's in them that counts  --  it 's what is n't . The voice is interrupted by a peal of thunder . Bill jumps , so do all the others , especially the veterans . The sound of it is almost like that of a burst of a bomb . Bill and the veteran next to him smile rather sheepishly at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash of lightning and another crack of thunder . &nbsp; BILLGosh , I sure hope so . The veteran looks at him strangely . CAMERA IS MOVING IN ON Bill 's face fast as he is still smiling . &nbsp; SUSAN 'S VOICERain 's lucky for us , Bill . DISSOLVE 4A SUBWAY KIOSK - 1937-1938 CLOSEUP - Bill 's face as it used to be - somewhat younger . Now he wears a summer shirt , open at the throat summer-weight suit , light shoes . He looks up at the same angle as before , but seriously now  --  worried . CAMERA STARTS MOVING BACK to include Susan . &nbsp; SUSAN 'S VOICE ( continuing ) Did n't you hear me ? Bill and Susan are standing in the shelter of a subway kiosk . SOUND of rain beating on the glass above them - a summer shower . Susan is lovely ; light hair - gray- green eyes , a compact , beautifully-made body . She wears white sandals and a light print dress , no wedding ring . . . . . In spite of the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cont 'd ) Did n't you hear me ? &nbsp; BILLHuh ? He pulls out a handkerchief and runs it around inside of his collar . &nbsp; SUSANIt rained the day you came to New York . It rained the day we met . You said it was lucky for us . He reaches around her and pokes his hand out . &nbsp; BILLBoy ! Look at it come down ! ( hopefully ) Maybe we ca n't go , huh ? &nbsp; SUSAN ( amused ) Nervous ? &nbsp; BILL ( mournfully ) I bet she 'll think I 'm a dope . Susan laughs . &nbsp; SUSANNo she won't. ( she looks at him ) She 's my sister . She 'll like you . &nbsp; BILL ( still brooding ) I think I 'll bring her a box of candy . &nbsp; SUSAN ( emphatically ) Oh Bill , no ! You do n't hafta do that . ( after a moment , tentatively ) Martha likes the hard center kind . He looks at her quickly . &nbsp; BILLYou 're afraid , too . Susan starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; SUSANIt 's stopping . Come on .  --  10  --  She takes his hand , and as they start to walk out of the shelter , she glances at his shoulder . &nbsp; SUSAN ( cont 'd ) No - wait ! They stop and she picks off a little piece of thread from his shoulder . She beams at him triumphantly and then is suddenly abashed at her display of posessiveness . &nbsp; SUSAN ( cont 'd ) ( sheepishly ) Excuse me . He grins at her , and then he takes her hand . &nbsp; BILL ( confidently ) Come on , baby , your family ca n't scare us ! They step out of the kiosk into the bright rain . As they move , the disclose a newspaper headline of July , 1937 : EARHART LOST QUICK DISSOLVE Section Details 5 EXT . UNION AVENUE - THE BRONX - DAY FULL SHOT . Bill and Susan walk through the white-hot sunlight , Bill carrying a box of candy under his arm . This is a district of brownstones , monotonous in their similarity . Massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front doors , others leading down to areaway entrances . The wetness from the shower is rising into the air in steam , leaving only occasional puddles . In one of these , several kids are splashing with bare feet . In the middle of the street a group of older boys are playing stick-ball . Up and down the block , on almost every doorstep , whole families are gathered , talking comfortably . Above , dotted here and there , are people sociably leaning out of windows on bed-pillows . Parked on the sidewalk , all by itself , is a baby carriage containing a wailing baby . It 's a quiet Sunday afternoon in the Bronx . In the f.g . is the large portable toolbox , the street barriers , red lamps and materials of a road-mending gang . Printed across the toolbox are the letters : WPA . Susan and Bill walk slowly down the street .  --  11  --  Two boys are playing marbles . A woman 's voice comes over the shot . &nbsp; WOMAN 'S VOICERobert , come up and eat your lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up . &nbsp; BOYAhh , Ma ! Just when I 'm winning ! Susan and Bill laugh and walk on . &nbsp; BILL ( indicating the candy ) The candy 's going to be all melted . &nbsp; SUSANThe paper says its the highest Sunday temperature in sixteen years . They walk by a huge puddle , in the middle of which sits a nondescript , bedraggled little puppy . On the edge of the puddle , is a little girl , about three years old . She is crouched down as she beckons frantically to the little dog . Susan stops , but Bill , unnoticing , walks on . &nbsp; LITTLE GIRL ( almost in tears ) Please , George , come out now . We 're gon na get spanked , George . Mama wants us home . Please , come out now ! Susan stoops down at the edge of the puddle , opposite the little girl . She talks to the puppy . &nbsp; SUSAN ( reasonably ) You 'd better come out , George . ( she nods toward the little girl ) We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , George . The puppy , really baffled by this double attack , does n't move . He sits , unhappy and bewildered , in the middle of the pool . Suddenly the CAMERA SHOWS Bill clean , white shoes slopping through the puddle . They stop by the little dog and Bill hands come down and scoop him up . Bill walks out holding the puppy at arm 's length . He gives it to the now ecstatic little girl . She hugs the wet , muddy George fiercely . &nbsp; LITTLE GIRL ( reprovingly ) Oh , George !  --  12  --  She turns and , still carrying the puppy , marches down the street . Bill takes out his handkerchief and wipes his hands . Susan looks up at him and smiles . She like him . She takes his arm and they continue down the street . They take a few steps , and over shot comes the shrill SOUND of kids ' voices . &nbsp; KIDS ' VOICESHey , Grandma ! Give us some , Grandma ! Hey Grandma ! Susan and Bill look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beesley walks quickly down the sidewalk on thick-ankled legs , approaching her house  --  and Susan and Bill - from the opposite direction . A wide-brimmed rusty-black hat of straw flops with every step . Barbara and Billy , red-haired dressed in ragged sunsuits , tag along after her . She holds a small ice cream carton to her chest . Over one of her arms , hanging by the strap , is an old , black handbag . The CAMERA SHOWS Mrs. Beesley and the children . &nbsp; BILLCome on , Grandma  --  give us some ice cream ! Come on  --  pleeeese ! &nbsp; BARBARAPlease Grandma ! Come on  --  you know us ! Mrs. Beesley continues grimly down the sidewalk . Billy grabs at her dress , but she brushes him off . CAMERA PANS WITH her as she comes face to face with Susan and Bill . &nbsp; SUSANHi , Mrs. Beesley  --  ( gesturing to Bill ) This is Mr. Cummings . &nbsp; MARTHAPleased to meet you .

Well , tell her I ai n't givin ' them no ice cream ' cause it might just give them a bellyache.  --  13  --  She nods and plunges down the steps to the areaway entrance . The kinds run after her . &nbsp; THE KIDSPlease , Grandma  --  it wo n't give us a bellyache  --  come on , just  --  Mrs. Beesley disappears through the door and slams it shut in their faces . They clamor at the door , find that it 's locked and come slowly back to Susan and Bill .

He is eating from a bunch of grapes , holding them above his mouth , pulling them off with his teeth . &nbsp; SUSANCharlie Beesley  --  this is Bill Cummings .

If she is n't . . . Alice  --  skinny , blonde , hipless , flat-chested , comes to the door in a faded kimono . She stops yelling when she sees Bill and Susan . &nbsp; ALICE ( flustered ) Oh , Susan ! . . . Pardon me . She disappears into the house .  --  15  --  &nbsp; CHARLIE ( disgustedly , to Bill ) My wife . Eating the grapes , he crosses to feel in the baby carriage which stands in the sheltered corner . Susan rings Martha 's doorbell . The front door starts clicking wildly , a signal from above that it has been unlocked . Susan starts to open it , the clicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door clicks and both of them jump to get through before the clicking stops . They are too late . Charlie comes up behind them , sees their predicament and gives the door a resounding kick with his foot . It flies open . &nbsp; BILLThanks. 9 INT . MARTHA 'S APARTMENT - DAY Susan and Bill start up the stairs . Martha stands at the top to see who is coming . She is still in her twenties , but looks older . She wears a wraparound apron dress  --  its shapelessness hiding a good figure . &nbsp; SUSANHi , sis ! &nbsp; MARTHA ( good-naturedly ) Oh , for gosh sakes , you would bring him today . The house is a mess . &nbsp; SUSANShut up , you . She reaches the top of the stairs and kisses Martha . &nbsp; SUSAN ( cont 'd ) We came to see you , not the house .  --  16  --  &nbsp; MARTHAJust the same , you should have let me know . ( shaking hands with Bill ) I guess you 're Mr. Cummings . Bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

( she turns to a door ) Come on in  --  if you can wade through . 10 INT . MARTHA 'S KITCHEN - DAY WIDE ANGLE toward door . They come through the narrow hall that leads directly into the kitchen . On the kitchen wall , up high near the ceiling , is the electric meter . The door of the fusebox below it is open . In the kitchen , a table set against the stone washtub still holds the dirty dishes of Sunday dinner . Crowding the room is a collapsible ironing-board , a roll of sprinkled clothes , while garments already ironed hang across the backs of chairs . &nbsp; MARTHA ( entering ) I have n't even washed my dishes yet . &nbsp; SUSANWhere 's Hank ? Martha begins folding clothes . Susan helps her . &nbsp; MARTHASleeping . I wanted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said it was too hot . &nbsp; SUSANBut it was n't too hot for you to be ironing .  --  17  --  &nbsp; MARTHA ( unperturbed ) It 's mostly the kids ' things . They go through more clothes in summer time . I ca n't wait till school opens again . Suddenly she stiffens as shrill commotion comes from the street beyond the room they are about to enter . &nbsp; MARTHA ( cont 'd ) It 's that darn woman again  --  She rushes ahead . Susan and Bill follow . 11 INT . MARTHA 'S LIVING ROOM - DAY WIDE ANGLE . Martha hurries to a front window , peers through a screen , then unhooks it and leans out .

BEESLEY 'S VOICENo , he 's inside calling up Jake to find out what 's taking them so long . They 're going for a ride on the Bronx River Parkway . &nbsp; MARTHAYou ought to go with them , Ma . The fresh air would do you good . &nbsp; MRS .

Oh look - do n't do that ! I 'll get to it later . They lean the ironing board against the wall . Martha waves them both to chairs , flops in one herself and starts to open the candy . &nbsp; MARTHA ( cont 'd ) ( to Bill ) You 'll probably get a fine impression of me , but honest some day I 'm going to kill that dame . ( breaking the seal on the box with her thumb-nail ) It 's bad enough living in the same house with your mother-in-law , but when she owns the building  --  ! I 'd rather live in a tent ! And the minute Hank gets a job -  --  19  --  &nbsp; MARTHA ( cont 'd ) - the second he gets one , I 'm going to wrap this up - ( indicating the room ) - and shove it down her throat !  --  ( looking toward the doorway ) So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 INT . LIVING ROOM - DAY NEW ANGLE - Hank  --  his face puffy with sleep , hair damp , comes in from the kitchen . He is as large as Charlie , but not as soft . &nbsp; HANK ( yawning , scratching his chest ) How do you expect anybody to sleep with you yelling all the time . He spots Susan and Bill . A gleam comes into his eyes . &nbsp; HANK ( cont 'd ) Well , Susie , is this the guy ? Susan winces . Hank inspects Bill doubtfully . &nbsp; HANK ( cont 'd ) Hmmm . &nbsp; MARTHA ( good-naturedly ) Stop it , Hank . Let ' em alone . ( sharply ) And put on a shirt ! &nbsp; HANK ( grinning ) What for ? My underwear 's clean . &nbsp; MARTHA ( to the world ) Could n't you kill a man like that ? ( as Hank shuffles into the parlor , looking at Bill ) Bill Cummings  --  my husband , Hank . &nbsp; HANK ( shaking hands ) Glad to know you .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a shirt .

Go and get it . &nbsp; HANKCome on , Bill , I 'll give you the low-down on these two dames before you get sucked in.

He goes into the kitchen . 15 CLOSER SHOT - MARTHA AND SUSAN Susan sits on the stool in front of the player-piano . &nbsp; SUSANThis still work ? &nbsp; MARTHA ( taking the lid off the candy ) Off and on . The kids break it , then Hank fools with it and it plays again .

( appeasement ) Of course I want you to use your own judgment but - - - She stops and they both look at one another and laugh . &nbsp; SUSANHave n't heard you say that in years . Remember how it 'd always work with me ? &nbsp; MARTHAYeah , that 's why I 'd use it . &nbsp; SUSANI used to think " gee , she 's bein ' so reasonable , I 'd be a heel not to do what she asked me . " That was the idea , huh ? &nbsp; MARTHAYeah , you were a good kid , Susie . &nbsp; SUSAN ( smiling ) But not now , is that it ? &nbsp; MARTHAOh honey ! Look , Susie , why do n't you . . . ? &nbsp; SUSAN ( gently ) Why do n't I what ? &nbsp; MARTHAWhy do n't you learn something from Hank and me ? Look at us !

She holds the new dress up to her shoulders , and examines the effect critically . Bill does n't stir . The dress passes muster and Susan announces triumphantly : &nbsp; SUSANIs n't it fine !

The roof is supported by iron girders , once painted , now cracked and peeling . Down each side of the hall are long lines of folding camp chairs . To one side of the entrance is the orchestra : " Patsy Dean 's Radio Ramblers " . On the other side of the entrance a white-clothed table with punch bowls and attendants serving punch . Plastered high up along the furthest wall is a giant-sized poster on which is printed : " IRONQUILL CLUB 'S ANNUAL DANCE - YOUR HOST - HAPPY TOM ( " IT 'S IN THE BAG WITH ) BAGLEY !

The music ends and they stop dancing . &nbsp; SUSAN ( cont 'd ) ( softly ) Bill , is n't this swell ? He looks at her . He 'd like to say " I love you " . He 'd like to say a million things . &nbsp; BILLMm-hm . He takes her hand and leads her off the dance floor . He steers her to the group of Beesleys , who have taken over a section of the folding camp chairs . In the group are Martha , wearing an obviously retailored dress of pink satin ; Mrs. Beesley , who is in grey taffeta , and who is inflating with puffed cheeks , one of the pneumatic , doughnut-shaped cushions that people take to football games ; next to her is Margie in a tight-fitting strapless gown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made-up , and wearing a tight , low-necked dress of black satin , a gold crucifix . Beside her is Charlie , who is using one of Alice 's slippers to hammer in a nail sticking up through the other . With the exception of Mrs. Beesley , all of them have little glass cups in their hands , which Hank is in the act of spiking . He is walking down the line of Beesleys pouring a healthy shot of liquor in each cup . As he reaches Alice -  --  86  --  &nbsp; HANKHere y'are Gorgeous , the Beesley Boomerang !

A nineteen-year-old girl in a tight black evening dress comes to the microphone and sings beautifully . From this distance she might be attractive . Closer , it will be obvious that she is n't .

The people on the fringe of the crowd standing around the microphone gradually begin to move and sway , compelled by the rhythm of the blues song .
