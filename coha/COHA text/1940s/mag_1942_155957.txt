France was an old man remembering a mistress with whom he had been unwise but gay as spring-France and Democracy . Ah , the whole world had envied them . How pleasant had been their dream of Liberte , egalite , fraternite . And how agreeable to lie late abed in the mornings . <P> Of course there had been hell to pay . But must every fishwife scream about it now ? Why must five " guilty men " in the Palais de Justice at Riom be shamed , to appease hypocrites in Vichy who claimed never to have lain late abed , or Nazi interlopers whose dreams were always nightmares ? <P> To France , the trial itself was the disgrace . There was no gallantry in it , only misery and recrimination and bitter remembrance . But it must be held . Some one , it seemed , must be made the scape goat because France had turned Democracy into a greedy , complacent hag . <P> Heavy with dramatic overtones , the trial opened in the beige and dark oak Salle d'Assises , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edouard Daladier and Leon Blum , the once-great Generalissimo Maurice Gustave Gamelin , onetime Air Minister Guy La Chambre* and a controller general of a once-great Army , Pierre Jaco-met . The accusation originally had been that they led France to war , but now the Vichy Government had watered down the charge to " betrayal of duties or charges " in the preparation and conduct of the war . <P> For more than 17 months the accused had been imprisoned . Now at last they could speak . <P> " Messieurs , la Cour . " In a long-sleeved red robe with a jabot of lace at the throat and a cloak with ermine neck piece , the Chief Justice of the special tribunal , velvety Pierre Caous , took his seat . Flanking him were four other justices , an admiral , an Air Force general , glittering with war decorations . At the order " Introduisez les accuses , " the five defendants filed in . First was Jacomet , a humble , whipped-dog expression on his lean face . Next the soft-footed , bearlike hulk of Leon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . Third was La Chambre , youngest of the five . Then came the aged gamecock , General Game lin , his face wan from prison illness , his mustache no longer a trim , precise line above his lips . Last was Daladier , thick-necked Bull of Vaucluse . They sat facing the judges . Behind them 200 newspapermen , using Darlan police guards as copy boys , waited to send the story of France 's shame to the world 's far corners . <P> Not Dishonor . In a quavering voice General Gamelin read a declaration which implied that several times he had tried to resign in protest against the lack of war material . Having sacrificed himself , he could not bring dishonor on the Army by giving further testimony . It was obvious that General Gamelin 's defense would be that no responsibility could be attached to him for " a regime which has disappeared . "
