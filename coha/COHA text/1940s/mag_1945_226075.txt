When she stepped ashore in Haifa , she wept . Feige Fried 's mother , seven brothers and sisters would never know Palestine 's freedom . They had disappeared into the Nazi crematorium at Oswiecim ; Feige escaped . <P> With the 26-year-old Jewess came 996 other refugees , the last allowed to enter Palestine under Britain 's 1939 White Paper . <P> Already the Arabs had planned a boycott of Jewish goods . Now they again threatened a strike throughout the Middle East , spoke of cutting off U.S. and British oil concessions . Nobody paid much attention to the threats , but they reflected rising Arab tempers . If there is trouble , the Jews will fight back . Now being demobilized in Europe , veterans of the war-wise Jewish Brigade are coming home to Palestine ( see cut ) ; 23,000 armed Jewish settlement police are already on the spot . <P> Into troubled Palestine the British last week sent new thousands of battle-hardened soldiers , ready for a fight .

Americans have been generous with typical big brotherly advice on the Middle East . miserly when it comes to assuming responsibility there . Responsibility means U.S. soldiers , guns , planes and ships . Was the U.S. ready to put up ? <P> The New York Times 's Herbert L. Matthews reported from London that Harry Truman and Prime Minister Attlee had agreed on a joint policy . But the British Foreign Office said the U.S. had made no military commitment . A vast selling job would be necessary to persuade Congress to send armed forces to Palestine . <P> The burden of the Middle East was still Britain 's . Leftwingers came up with a suggestion likely to appeal to TVA-minded Americans : a Jordan Valley Authority which would irrigate thousands of now-arid acres , make possible development of light industries , enable Palestine to enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected a British announcement this week on Palestine immigration . As soon as possible thereafter , Britain will almost certainly toss the entire explosive issue at the already overburdened United Nations Organization .
