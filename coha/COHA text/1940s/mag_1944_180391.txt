David Louis Behncke , mild-looking , 210-lb. president of the Air Line Pilots ' Association , last week was waging a stubborn war with the Civil Aeronautics Board in his favorite cause : pilots ' safety . Since the airlines can not expect to get any new planes this year , and are operating their skeleton fleet of 175 ships an average of 11.5 hours a day , the most obvious way to meet the enormous demand for air transportation is to boost the load each plane is licensed to carry . CAB has proposed to increase the Douglas DC-3 take-off weight limit of 25,200 Ib. by 1,000 Ib. and the 24,400-lb. landing weight by 800 Ib . <P> Behncke protests that cramming 1,000 Ib. of added payload into commercial planes , most of which are five or six years old , would be highly risky for pilots and passengers . CAB engineers have made exhaustive test flights in DC-3s loaded to the higher weight limits , and the Air Transport Command calmly loads its DC-35 up to 29,000 Ib. for military flights . But Dave Behncke is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he argues , " is the cushion of safety which the pilot must have to land safely if something goes wrong while in flight , and that cushion of safety is narrowed too much with these new weights . " <P> An added 1,000 Ib. per plane would not solve the airlines ' wartime traffic problem . Only more planes can do that . But the Behncke-CAB row marks a milestone in air transport labor relations . Ever since 1934 , when Behncke was an airmail pilot on the Chicago-Omaha run and was forced by bad weather to pancake his plane into a treetop , he has doggedly campaigned for greater safety in flying . Unhurt in the crash , he toppled ignobly to the ground while getting out of his wrecked ship , broke his leg , quit flying . Since its beginning in 1931 he has headed the A.L.P.A. ( 4,500 members ) , which he helped found . Reasonable in his dealings with management , Behncke has been unrelentingly stubborn about safety measures . <P> The issue now is : Will CAB or Dave Behncke write the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
