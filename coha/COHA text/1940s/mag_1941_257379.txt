Dr. Rexford Guy Tugwell , one of the most trusted Brain Trusters of the First New Deal , last week got a new job : chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico . Paradoxically , although it returned him to his original calling as an educator , it looked more like a step toward a political comeback . <P> Dr. Tugwell , who learned Brain Trusting as a professor at Columbia University , resigned from the Resettlement Administration and the Second New Deal in 1936 to become a businessman ( American Molasses Co . ) . Two years later New York City 's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia made him chairman of his City Planning Commission . Last winter Secretary Harold Ickes retrieved him for the Fourth New Deal by sending him to Puerto Rico to study land use . <P> An authority on the problems of Puerto Rico , which he believes the U.S. has shamefully mismanaged , Tugwell is well-liked by Puerto Ricans . In the university chancellorship ( salary : $15,000 ) , they gave him the biggest job they had to offer . Meanwhile , Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington dopesters named Tugwell as his probable successor . Should Tugwell be appointed Governor , he could serve in that office without pay , take a leave of absence from his chancellorship with pay , and thus , though a U.S.-appointed Governor , remain an employe of the Puerto Ricans.
