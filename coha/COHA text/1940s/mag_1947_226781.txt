Many a traveler has remarked the resemblance between Southern California and Lebanon-the same sunny skies ( and unusual rains ) , golden beaches , orange groves , snowcapped mountains , religious cults , and taste for gossip with an overripe flavor . <P> Even California has produced no more overripe character than Dahish the Amazer , a dynamic hypnotist who set himself up in Lebanon as a second Christ , built up an ardent circle of cultists . At the top of his vogue , in 1944 , the souks ( bazaars ) of Beirut peddled many a rumor of orgies in his modern villa in the Mazraa section of the city . Over their tea at the Patisserie Suisse , over cocktails at the seaside Normandie , Beirutis whispered that Dahish was getting into trouble with the Government . Lebanon 's good , round President , Sheikh Bechara El Khoury , frowned on Dahish . <P> Worried . El Khoury is a natural worrier . In the fall of 1944 he had plenty of troubles-his wife 's illness , his scapegrace son 's escapades , his efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for opposing them in 1943 ) . <P> As if those were not worries enough , Khoury 's sister-in-law , Mrs. Margaret Haddad , had become Dahish 's most fanatical disciple . As the stories made the rounds of Beirut , the Government decided to act . Foreign Minister Selim Takla , buzzed the bazaars , was drafting a deportation order for Dahish . Then , on the night of Jan. 11 , 1945 , Takla entertained U.S. Minister George Wadsworth ( now Ambassador to Iraq ) at dinner . Wadsworth left the Foreign Minister , apparently fit and smiling , returned home to find a message that Takla had dropped dead . <P> " Ah ha , " said the Dahishites , " you see what happens to the enemies of Dahish ! " <P> Khoury 's worries increased . Margaret Haddad 's daughter , Magda , also a Dahish admirer , committed suicide . In Khoury 's eyes , Dahish had become not merely a nuisance but a menace . Khoury determined to get rid of him . <P> Before he acted , Khoury 's mind began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to inquire after his health , Khoury meandered into the room in his nightdress , asked " And who is this ? " Once , when he was being taken to his car for a visit to the doctor , he refused to enter , saying that he must take his eggplants with him . <P> " Ah ha , " said the Dahishites , " you see what happens to the enemies of Dahish . " <P> Unwanted . On Jan. 30 , Khoury disappeared . While his Ministers wondered whether his job should be declared vacant , he went quietly to Palestine to consult a Jewish neurologist . Two months later a cured Khoury returned to Beirut . <P> Thereafter Dahish was not long for Lebanon . Police nabbed him , beat him up , whisked him across the mountains to Aleppo in Syria . The battered hypnotist went off to live quietly in the little village of Kamishli in the Jezireh , on the upper reaches of the Euphrates . <P> Last month Beirut gossip mills had new grist . The Amazer , they said , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to attend a spiritualist convention .
