The commission , which has an appropriation of $100,000 , was authorized by the 1946 session of the Legislature , after the Democratic Minority Leaders had offered measures appropriating $50 , - 000,000 for a State university . The action was taken after charges were published that some colleges and universities in the State had adopted " quota " systems , under which a limited number of minority groups were admitted . Republican leaders opposed establishment of a State University at the time , contending that the subject was too important for hasty action . They also pointed out that no one was in a position to say , at that time , what the cost of such an institution would be , whether it should consist of a single university , located in one place , or a combination of colleges and universities throughout the State .
