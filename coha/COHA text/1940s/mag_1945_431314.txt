WHEN the giant airship Hindenburg exploded into flames at Lakehurst , N. J. , on the evening of May 6 , 1937 , many people believed that it was the end of a noble experiment in lighter-than-air travel . It was , indeed , the end of an era in that field . But a new era began soon after Hitler 's armies invaded Poland less than two and a half years later . American airships , nonrigid blimps , were drafted into patrol duty along our coasts . Little was said then about what those airships were doing , and only a little more may be said today about what they have done . But it is known that literally hundreds of them have piled up a log of hundreds of thousands of hours of strenuous patrol and convoy duty with a phenomenally low casualty record . On the basis of this record , backed by an impressive mass of figures and facts , American airship men are now prepared to bid for a place in the world 's postwar commercial aviation program . Anyone who looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble shrugging off the airship . Its advocates offer ? and back with facts ? many reasons for its revival in world commerce . Chief among the reasons are the airship 's speed and safety , its economy of operation , its reliability , and its load capacity . And Americans can add this clincher : we have a virtual world monopoly on helium , safest known gas for inflating lighter-than-air craft and clearly the key to successful operation of airships . It was the Germans who developed the airship and proved its commercial worth . Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin did his major work of development before and during World War I. Zeppelin , incidentally , made his first Hight here in America in 1863 , in a captive observation balloon of the Union Army . He had come here as a military observer , remained to fight for a time , and returned to Germany before the Civil War had ended . During the years of trial and development , nearly half a million passengers were carried by airships without a single passenger fatality until the Hindenbu g fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg , both built specially for transoceanic passenger and freight trade . The Graf - Zeppelin made 590 commercial flights totaling 17,177 hours and 1,053,618 miles . She made 144 ocean crossings and carried more than 13 , - 000 passengers and 250,000 pounds of mail and freight . Her log shows a flight to the Arctic and one to Egypt , and she circled the globe . She was retired without ever having had a serious accident . The Hindenburg , larger and more modern than the Graf Zeppelin , was in service less than a year . But in that time she made 63 flights , 37 ocean crossings , was in the air 3,088 hours , flew 209,527 miles , and carried more than 3,000 passengers and 41,000 pounds of mail and freight . American blimps also have a peacetime record well worth noting . Until they were taken over by the Navy , Goodyear 's commercial blimps had made 152,441 flights totaling 93,096 hours and 4,166,390 miles . They had carried 407,171 passengers without so much as a minor injury to anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we and other nations experimented for 15 years after 1920 ? have had no such record of success . Five of those huge ships met destruction in tragic fashion , and the world still remembers them . Each of those disastrous accidents , however , had its reason . In August 1921 , the British ZR-2 broke in two and burned , causing a loss of 62 lives . The ZR-2 was a hydrogen-filled ship copied  | from a lightly built German " zep " captured at the end of World War I ; it was flown by a crew unfamiliar with air stresses . In December 1923 , the French Dixmude vanished over the Mediterranean with a crew of 53 men . The Dixmude was a lightweight , hydrogen-inflated German ship seized after the armistice , and the French crew was inexperienced . In September 1925 , the U. S. Navy 's Shenandoah broke in two in a line squall near Ava , Ohio , and 14 of her crew were lost .  | The Shenandoah was a modified copy of a German " zep " built in 1916 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter any violent storm area . In April 1933 , the U. S , Navy 's Akron crashed into the sea off the New Jersey coast with a loss of 73 lives . She ran blindly into a violent thunderstorm and , because of a faulty altimeter , slammed her tail into the waves while trying to maneuver out of the storm . In February 1935 , the U. S. Navy 's Macon  | was forced down off the Pacific coast and was lost . Two men died with her . She , too , was fundamentally a sound ship . But she was ordered to put out on fleet maneuvers before changes ordered in her aft structure had been completed , and she lost a fin in a bit of rough weather . Subsequently , she lost a good deal of gas and settled on the ocean , where the waves ripped her to pieces . Of these five military airships , only the Akron and the Macon were even comparatively modern . Airmen who know what happened insist that neither ship should have been lost . Any sensible flyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with today 's aerology he knows when he is approaching a storm area and how to avoid it . Both the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg met and mastered such situations repeatedly . In fact , the fate of these military airships merely emphasizes the safety record of the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg. fn considering air travel , we naturally think of speed . And in thinking of speed over long distances , most of us turn instinctively to the 350-miles-an-hour air- plane . But over long distances , factors other than maximum speed under ideal conditions must be considered . There are layovers , turn hacks , delays , overnight stops . The longer the trip , the more these factors affect elapsed-time speed . Rear Admiral Charles E. Rosendahl , probably America 's most experienced airship man , has compiled eye-opening figures on comparative air speeds . He points out that over a five-year period ending late in 1941 transpacific commercial planes on schedule between San Francisco and Hong Kong showed elapsed-time averages of about 35 miles an hour westward and 33 miles an hour eastward . Bad-weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual flying time and increased elapsed time . Admiral Rosendahl 's figures also show that commercial air travelers bound across the North Atlantic just before the present war were taken in the winter months by a roundabout southern route requiring an  | average of four clays and 16 hours per passage . This , according to Admiral Rosendahl 's calculations , gave them an average elapsed-time speed of only about 30 miles an hour . The only comparable airship figures are those of the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg . In 1929 the Graf Zeppelin made the trip from Japan to San Francisco in 69 hours , at an average speed of nearly 75 miles an hour , elapsed time . The Hindenburg 's average operational speed , also elapsed time , was nearly 65 miles an hour for all her ocean passages . The passengerplane schedule from San Francisco to Hong Kong was six days and seven hours . An airship with the Hindenburg 's average performance would make the same trip in about four and a half days . The airship 's advantage here comes from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can halt in midair for motor repairs , that it has sufficient range to go far around a bad-weather area and can even seek a clear area and cruise with only enough movement for steerageway until bad weather ahead clears up . In fact , the Hindenburg 's record shows that she never failed to make a scheduled commercial trip ; she took off several times when the weather was so bad that all airplanes were grounded ; and she never was more than 12 hours late on a scheduled North Atlantic westward crossing or six hours late on an eastward crossing . Also , its ability to hover permits an airship to delay its landing if that is necessary . Once , warned by radio of a revolution , a German airship postponed her landing at Recife , Brazil , and merely headed into the wind for two days . For hauls of . L , 000 to 2,000 miles the airship can not compete with the airplane in speed , though it can offer stiff competition in economy of operation . Passenger revenue alone covered more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including amortization , and the ship never carried a capacity load of paying passengers . Passenger comfort is another notable factor . The Hindenburg had 25 two-berth staterooms , smoking and writing rooms , promenades , three bars , and deck space totaling an eighth of an acre . Her noise level was rated at 61 decibels , lower even than that of a Pullman car . There was not enough vibration to ripple the surface of a glassful of water . And because of its size , the airship absorbs the air bumps which toss an airplane around to the discomfort of its passengers . According to the records , there never was a case of airsickness or seasickness on either the Graf Zeppelin or the Hindenburg . Can we build good airships ? We built two , the Akron and the Macon , both of which were lost , according to findings of official courts of inquiry , because of operational mistakes . Goodyear now has in blueprint plans for a ship of 10,000,000 cubic feet capacity , half again as large as the Macon and more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements on the best that the Germans ever made . New materials made available since the war began will permit still further improvement . Professor J. C. Hunsaker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a noted aeronautical scientist , sees the transatlantic services of the future falling into three categories : a five-day steamship service , a oneday airplane service , and a two-day airship schedule . " Consideration of the operating record of the Hintidenburg in North Atlantic service , " he says , " leads to the conclusion that a similar airship of 28 percent greater displace- ment should have a payload of 100 passengers and 20,000 pounds of mail and express when inflated with helium . " American designers were the first to move the engines inboard to reduce drag , and to swivel the propellers for better control . Now it is suggested that both engines and propellers be placed in a central tunnel running the length of the ship , which would further reduce drag and improve control , and at the same time add a jet-propulsion effect . Also , it seems likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus greatly increasing efficiency . These changes , experienced lighter-than-air authorities believe , could increase airship cruising speeds to as much as 125 miles an hour . As for costs , it is worth noting that our whole military airship program up to 1941 cost less , for instance , than LaGuardia Field , New York City 's airport . This included the building of three rigid airships ? the Shenandoah , the Akron , and the Macon ? construction of two airship docks and bases , one on each coast , and five mooring masts , one on a ship for sea moorings . This airship program cost $30,000,000 . LaGuardia Field cost $42,000,000 . Finally , America 's monopoly on helium makes an American airship program a " natural . " Add to that the fact that its shipment and storage are both complicated and expensive , which means it probably will remain here . Helium has nearly 93 percent as much lift as hydrogen , is an inert gas , and is foolproof and virtually accidentproof . Given capable handling , the weather information now available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand a place in any international program of postwar commercial aviation .  |
