txt BLAME : Placing It Is it possible that the rank and file of labor are slackers and saboteurs ? Certainly not . Do the Industrialists want us to lose the war ? Most assuredly not . What 's wrong then ? Why do men whose own sons are in the Army on , a $21-a-month pay basis , with twentyfour hours a day duty , seven days a week if necessary , ask for higher wages and want time and a half for overtime and double pay for Sundays ? The answer is they are as patriotic as any other group and they do n't want itThey are told they want it by the typ. of union labor leadership that will eventually kill the goose that laid the golden egg . If we do n't win this war , I am sure Mr. Schickelgruber will not let us maintain the forty-hour week , with extra pay for overtime . And as for the industrialist that wants his extra dollar of profit , I refer him to Fritz Thyssen. ? Jossex H. PALE ; New York ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
