In the House of Lords , five days before Palm Sunday , up rose the Church of England 's foremost humanitarian , the Archbishop of York . Said the gentle , 70-year-old Most Reverend and Right Honorable Cyril Forster Garbett : there should be no sensational public trials of " the master war criminals Hitler and Himmler and their gang who have corrupted Germany and ordered these hideous crimes " ; as soon as their identity is established " those who catch them should at once put them to death . " <P> The Allies , he said , could then concentrate on trying and punishing " the subordinates , who could have refused to give orders for these crimes and yet who have sometimes carried them out on their own initiative with enthusiasm and delight . . . . I am thinking of the horrible tortures in concentration camps , of the burning of women and children in that church in southern France where the whole population was massacred , of crimes which no man ought to commit , however strong the order given to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole German people . We can not entirely distinguish them from the Nazis . . . . <P> " It would , of course , be much more pleasant for me to plead for mercy , but sometimes justice has to take precedence over mercy , just as righteousness has to take precedence over peace . "
