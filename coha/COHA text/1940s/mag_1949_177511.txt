Off Lancashire this week the sea was a stormy , threatening grey . Grey and stormy , too , was the future that faced 1,500 Labor Party delegates , gathered in Blackpool for the party 's 48th annual conference . The slogan for the 1950 elections was : " Labor believes in Britain . " The question was : Does Britain still believe in Labor ? <P> From Blackpool , TIME Correspondent <P> Honor Balfour cabled : " This is a conference of worried men . From back-street boarding houses to the big , red brick Cliffs Hotel on the upper-class north shore , there 's a sense of disquiet , restiveness , uncertainty . Gone are the days when delegates huddled in eager groups in cafes and lounges , heads thrust forward in lively argument , eyes shining in anticipation of a great crusade . Gone are the more recent days when , flushed with new power , they sank into easy chairs and sprawled in happy discussion , secure in the knowledge that an order to their parliamentary steamroller would change the face of Britain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eager fire has died . The smooth confidence has disappeared . In the hotel lounge , a party leader said , ' Yes , perhaps we are facing the great disillusion . ' " <P> The delegates had more to worry about than recent defeats in county elections ( TIME , April 18 ) . The sharp spring drop in Britain 's exports threatened rising unemployment . Many economists would welcome this , on the argument that a " normal " pool of unemployed would act as a brake on trade-union demands which have been pushing up production costs and pricing British goods out of export markets . Laborite politicos , however , believed that in the present mood of Britons a " normal " unemployment of 1,000,000 would kill the Labor Party 's hopes of winning next year 's general elections . <P> Meanwhile , union members , disappointed by nationalization , were becoming increasingly hard for their government to handle . Last week , a wildcat strike of railway workers against the nationalized railway system was spreading . Liverpool dockers were out , and London truckers were engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wash milk bottles had struck . <P> Delegates at Blackpool did not try to play down the danger . Militant Aneurin Bevan was in a somber mood when he addressed a preconference rally . Said Bevan : " Some of our people . . . appear to have achieved material prosperity in excess of their moral stature . Some of them have got what they have got too easily and they are in danger of throwing away by a few months of dissipating anarchy what we have spent our lifetime in building up . "
