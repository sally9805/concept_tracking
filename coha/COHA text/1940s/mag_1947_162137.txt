I 've drunk your health in company ; <P> I 've drunk your health alone ; <P> I 've drunk your health so many times , <P> I 've damn near ruined my own . <P> This toast is a favorite with crusty old Fleet Admiral William F. Halsey . Last week such Halseyisms drew down the wrath of the Methodist Board of Temperance . <P> In a public statement , the Methodists noted that the Halsey memoirs , written with the help of Journalist J.
