Which is nearer the end of its military rope : Japan 's ally , Germany , or the U.S. 's ally , China ? Few Americans asked the question , but some Chinese wondered . <P> Since capturing Hengyang ( TIME , Aug. 28 ) , the Japanese drive , spearheaded by five divisions with as many more in support , has advanced southwest at the rate of ten miles a day . It cut right through the Chinese army that opposed them-the Chinese , with no ammunition left , had to get away as best they could . The Japs overran Lingling , a Fourteenth Air Force field . At that rate of advance , ten days more would put them in Kweilin , site of a major U.S. air base and capital of Kwangsi Province . <P> There were ominous reports that further Jap divisions were moving down from the Honan front to Hunan , reports that flotillas of Jap reinforcements were steadily moving up the Yangtze River , reports from Hunan that a brigade of 200 light tanks was ready to go into action soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger number of men-but incomparably less equipment . And the nearest Chinese reinforcements were in Yunnan , about 30 days ' march distant . <P> Bottleneck . One natural defense remained . A scant 15 miles south of the Kwangsi border , before which the Japs were poised , is the Hwangshaho defile , where river , railroad and highway all pass through a gap five miles wide and eight miles long . Here , if anywhere , a stand must be made . But it must be made with lesh against machines . Cabled TIME 'S Correspondent Teddy White : " Kwangsi 's one resource , its one hope of resistance , now lies in marshaling a people 's army such as helped to stop the Japanese in their first penetration of this province four years ago . " <P> Cost of the Loss . If the Japanese take Kweilin , they will : 1 ) deprive free China of the rice , manufactures and other resources which come from the southern coast provinces ; 2 ) win the chance to open an overland route to Indo China ; 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bases whence it has raided Japanese shipping and supported the now almost exhausted Chinese armies behind the coast . <P> What that U.S. air force has meant to China was indicated in a ballad reprinted last week by the New York Times from Chungking 's Central Weekly-titled Ballad of the Eagles , written by Tien Chin , translated by Frank Tao : <P> . . . Blue is the vast sky , <P> The eagles sound like thunder in the spring night , <P> Under the moon their eerie shadows chase them . . . . <P> During the enemy 's attack on Hunan . . . Their bullets rained in the sun , Drawing geysers of enemy blood . <P> They smashed the horsemen of the <P> oppressor <P> Like a man trampling ants with his feet . <P> While returning after a victory , <P> To the airport by the river , <P> One of the eagles was forced to alight <P> on the grass plain <P> The villagers , seeing the warrior , Were so happy tears came to their eyes . <P> They took him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrate came to meet him And to offer toasts of yellow wine . <P> The flying warrior smiled <P> A pleasant smile . <P> He was clad in khaki <P> And his beard and hair were yellow . <P> His eyes were as blue <P> As the sharp dagger blade he carried . <P> Firecrackers were lighted in front of all
