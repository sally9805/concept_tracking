Until last week Private Christian Zeissler , of the noth Quartermaster Regiment , had served six months without pay . A Russian-born alien , he had been drafted by mistake , and the Comptroller General held that draftee aliens could n't draw pay . But a section of the new Military Appropriations Act authorized him to draw a salary after July 1 . Last week he had his first check . But only an act of Congress can get Private Zeissler what is owing him for his first five months in the Army .
