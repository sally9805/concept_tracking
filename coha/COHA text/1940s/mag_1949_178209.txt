For 23 years , Oregon has had a law forbidding high-school secret societies but in Oregon 's largest city , high-school kids have paid no attention . In Portland ( pop . 400,000 ) , the societies flourish . They have mysterious names like EUK , Pack and Domino ; they pledge socially prominent classmates , hotshot athletes or just kids " who have something , " from convertibles to " cute personalities . " <P> Last week the Portland school board suddenly sat up and took notice . For one thing , the current Ladies ' Home Journal was carrying an expos of such societies that quoted a former Portland boy named Chuck Swanman . On " Hell Night " he had been taken to a faraway golf course " where the cops ca n't hear you yell , " forced to drink a mixture of a searing hot sauce compounded with pepper and garlic and ordered to smoke a handful of cigars , inhaling every puff . After he vomited , the " hackers " went to work , whacked him 50 times with an inch-thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Novocain , " Chuck reported , " but that just hurts worse when it wears off . " <P> The Portland school board had other evidence . A mother wrote in to describe what had happened to her son on Hell Night . " He hardly looked human . He was covered with blood , molasses and sawdust , and was shaking with spasms ... He was covered with red marks across his back and buttocks , the latter broken in many places and swollen . . . His teeth chattered so that he could not talk . " <P> Last week , Portland 's school board voted a ban of its own on the secret societies , announced that its rule and the state law would be enforced .
