On the city-room bulletin board one day last week , New York Times reporters saw and were startled by a small but significant notice . For the first time in 21 years , the Times had a new city editor . <P> Quiet-spoken David Joseph , 61 , who liked to go home before the sun went down and the first edition came up ( TIME , June 28 ) , had been made assistant managing editor . Into Joseph 's job went able , cool Robert Garst , 47 , who intends to keep.the same hours as most of his 150 reporters ( 2 to 11 p.m . ) . One sensible and ( for the Times ' ) revolutionary result : the new city editor would read his staff 's stories before they went into the morning paper , see the finished Times before its subscribers did . <P> Man from Virginia . Lanky , red-haired Bob Garst is all newspaperman ; marriage , remarked a friend last week , is about his only hobby ( his wife used to edit the Times 's letters column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times as a morgue clerk while studying at Columbia 's School of Journalism ( ' 24 ) . He has been on the Times news staff for 23 years , for the past two years as assistant night managing editor . In his spare time , Garst wrote ( with Timesman Ted Bernstein ) a widely used manual on copyreading , Headlines and Deadlines , and taught journalism at Columbia . <P> Garst is as methodical as a metronome , and as unexcitable . City-room staffers clock him in every day : hanging up his hat &; coat at 5:20 p.m. , putting them on again at exactly 12:05 a.m . Some times during the evening he looks up , summons one cf the city-room waiters and orders a sandwich and glass of milk from the cafeteria . Reporters like the way Garst seeks their judgment on a story 's value ( Garst : " How much space do you want to give it ? " ) , respect the quick but never superficial reading he gives their copy , admire his calm in a news crisis . Said Star Reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Man from Mississippi . Along with Garst 's promotion , the Times also shuffled five other news executives around-but brought in no new faces . Most important change : amiable , Mississippi-born Assistant Managing Editor Turner Catledge , who has spent 18 of his 47 years on the Times , moved up to acting managing editor . He will replace Edwin L. James , who sailed last week for a long vacation in Europe. * <P> * For news of another Straight , see MILESTONES . <P> * But not to start a Paris edition of the Times , as rumor had it . The Times gave up that idea two months ago . Said Publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger : " There 's not going to be a Paris edition , there 's not going to be a Berlin edition , there 's not going to be a London edition , there 's not going to be a Peking edition .
