The late Dr. Leta Stetter Hollingworth , a plump , motherly professor of education at Columbia University 's Teachers College , all her life deplored mankind 's inhumanity to geniuses . Eighteen years ago , as an experiment , she picked 50 of the brightest children ( I. Q. 130 to 200 ) * in New York City , started two special classes for them at Public School 165 , near Columbia . Like Stanford University 's Professor Lewis M. Terman ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) , who for 18 years has followed the careers of 1,300 gifted Californians , Dr. Hollingworth watched her " geniuses " as they grew . <P> Last week , as a memorial to Dr. Hollingworth , T. C. held a conference on Education for the Gifted . To it went 20 of her proteges , now in their late 20s to tell how they had fared . <P> Chairman of their meeting was Thomas McKay , 27 . Graduated from college at 20 , Thomas chose an unpromising vocation-selling bonds in Wall Street in 1933 . He made up to $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea as an ordinary seaman . By last week he was back at bond selling , had got an M.A. ( in economics ) and was studying nights for a Ph.D . Also present : Mrs. Helen Whitebook , radio writer , Jeanne Weiss , secretary . <P> Absent from the reunion was an anonymous genius with a more extraordinary career . Second brightest in the whole group , he graduated from , high school at 15 , became a professional bridge player-for stakes-was rated the world 's No. 7 amateur chess player . At 19 he suddenly gave up gambling , went to University of Chicago , whizzed through a four-year course in a year . At 25 , well launched toward a career as a lawyer , he died of cancer . <P> Most of the group had graduated from college in their teens , got modest jobs as teachers , writers , doctors , lawyers , secretaries , housewives . Most successful : Dr. Eugene Lozner , 26 , an authority on nutrition . None was unemployed . But they had many a complaint of social maladjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifted students try to pursue their interests , they are called grinds and apple polishers . They have to try for low grades if they want classmates to treat them as equals . I went to the University of Arizona , and I found out that there the thing to do was not to study but to go for moonlight rides on the desert . " <P> Other complaints : older classmates in high school and college derided their short pants and childish treble voices ; employers failed to recognize them as geniuses , turned them down as too young . The group divided 50-50 on whether segregation in special classes had made them intellectual snobs , agreed that skipping grades had left them with poor study habits . <P> To the learned educators , industrialists and doctors who had gathered to ponder these problems , famed Psychologist Edward Lee Thorndike made a concrete proposal : let the U. S. establish State asylums for underprivileged geniuses to match its asylums for the feebleminded . <P> <P> *Before she died last year , Dr. Hollingworth decided that she had rated genius too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.
