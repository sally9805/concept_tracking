The patient , a middle-aged businessman , faced the sanatorium psychiatrist defiantly . His wife was leaving him and his business partner was quitting . In the last , taut stage of a prodigious binge , the patient announced importantly that he had come to " dry out " again . <P> The psychiatrist said quietly : " Not this time . You will sign yourself in for 30 days or go somewhere else . " <P> The patient glared and clapped his hat on his head . Then defiance oozed out of him . He picked up a pen and signed himself in . <P> To the psychiatrist , Dr. Harry M , Tiebout , that surrender was as dramatic as a profession of religious faith . Dr. Tiebout believes that it was , essentially , a kind of spiritual awakening . Soon afterward , the patient joined Alcoholics Anonymous and quit drinking for good . He said to the psychiatrist some time later : " You did something to me when you made me sign that card . I knew you meant business . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own case any longer . . . . Then I felt calmer and quieter inside and have ever since . " <P> Surrender . Tweedy , genial Dr. Harry Tiebout ( pronounced teebo ) is physician-in-charge of the Blythewood sanatorium in Greenwich , Conn . He is also a lecturer at Yale 's School of Alcohol Studies and an admirer of Alcoholics Anonymous . Like many another psychiatrist , he had long wondered what mysterious power enables A.A. to reform alcoholics when psychiatry fails . He has decided that the secret of A.A. 's success is the alcoholics ' surrender to a higher power . And Dr. Tiebout has figured out a psychiatrist 's explanation for it . <P> Like other types of mental patients , alcoholics are generally self-centered and defiant . During drinking bouts especially , they develop expansive egos and large ideas , are given to a well-recognized disease known as " telephonitis , " i.e. , an irresistible itch to make long-distance phone calls , particularly to their psychiatrists ( one well-heeled alcoholic of Tiebout 's acquaintance runs up phone bills of $400 a month ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard psychotherapy - building up the patient 's ego and self-confidence-is sadly misplaced . He is convinced that an alcoholic who stubbornly tries to defeat the habit all by himself is sure to fail . A.A. 's major discovery , says the psychiatrist , is that the first essential step is the alcoholic 's admission that alone he is helpless against alcohol . <P> When the alcoholic quits trying to " run his own life , " his tension , his feeling of hostility toward his fellow men and his sense of isolation disappear ; he feels a vast relief and " release of power . " Said a Tiebout patient after joining A.A. : " Now I am not unhappy about being unhappy . Before , I used to plan ; now I can think without planning . " <P> Says Tiebout , a religious man but no churchgoer : " Surrender means cessation of fight . . . logically to be followed by internal peace and quiet . Loss of self is basic . And when the individual surrenders his ego , God automatically steps in. "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
