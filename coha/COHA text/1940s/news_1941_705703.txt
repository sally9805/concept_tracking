txt Moscow is a long way from the Stalin Line , but this fortification is nevertheless - the outer defense of the Soviet capital . The ordinary scale of weights and measures can not be applied to the Battle of Russia because of the sheer size of the battleground . By the Russian yardstick Moscow is on the western margin of their 5,000-mile-wide realm ; actually it is nearer to Paris and London than it is to the Soviet midlands  --  Omsk and the country beyond the Urals . So when the Germans reach the Dnieper River and begin to batter at the Stalin Line , they seem much closer to the capital to the Russians than to those who measure distance in miles instead of versts . The wall that Stalin built against the west is as wide as Russia . It is made of rivers and swamps , pillboxes and bunkers , buried guns and labyrinths of electric wire . It is wider than any defense ' system Hitler has hitherto tackled , and it remains to be seen whether it will hold better than Europe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Albert , the Carol , the Metaxas . Apparently only the spearhead of the Wehrmacht has arrived at this barrier . Fierce fighting still goes on between the locked armies behind the flying columns that have shot ahead . But at Orsha ? and Mogileff these advance units are poised to attack the Line at its strongest point . Here it is thrown seventY-five miles deep athwart the road to Moscow . Obviously the Germans are bound for Moscow and by the best-defended and quickest possible route . From the time the city was founded , a wooden fortress on the site of the Kremlin , in 1156 , it was repeatedly invaded from the east by the Golden Horde and by , the Tartars . Only one invader from the west has ever marched to Moscow , and although Napoleon 's army occupied the Kremlin and burned and plundered the city , the French could not conquer it . They stayed only a month , from Sept. 14 to Oct. 19 , 1812 , and then retreated over the long , hard road they had left in ruins as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Czar 's armies . Like Hitler , he was lured on by the riches waiting to be garnered in this undeveloped empire . But the sullen land starved him out and froze him out ; instead of a granary , it offered him a graveyard . Hitler 's expedition is not like Napoleon 's . Aside from the bombers , the tanks and the motorized divisions , it is better organized , more ferocious and more formidable . Aoscow is more formidable too . In Napoleon 's time it was the center but not the capital of an unorganized conglomeration of peoples . In the military sense it was poorly defended . Today , through the Communist party and the tightest and most far-reaching police system in the world , all the power in this immense domain is centralized in Moscow . As nerve center and control board of the Union of Soviet Republics , it is the capital of " all the Russias " as St. Petersburg never was . It is the Capital of the Proletariat , besides ; all that 's left of the fervor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typified by the red granite of Lenin 's tomb . The Kremlin is now only a backdrop for this shrine . We shall soon see whether the amorphous might of Russia has been crystallized or dissolved by the new religion , for this attack is also a test of the revolution , a test of the Stalin Line as a system of government as well as a system of defense . The Germans can take Moscow without conquering Russia . Stalin could retire behind the Urals and hold threequarters of the Soviet Union . But the loss of Moscow might be a fatal blow to Soviet power . Remember that all authority in this huge empire is concentrated in the Communist party , and every thread in the tight network is knotted in the Kremlin ; that the entire organization of industry , agriculture and life itself is centered here ; that it is the core of the entire transportation system . Moscow has an importance beyond that of any other capital . It is the solar - plexus of the Soviet system . Lenin abandoned Leningrad and established the capital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign intervention he used to say that as long as the Bolsheviks had Moscow they had Russia . But if they are . driven out of Moscow ? Hitler is a long way from the Kremlin , and whether he gets there , or whether he retreats like Napoleon , depends on other factors besides the force of his armies . In the Finnish war we heard that whole divisions of . Russian soldiers were killed because they were told by the political commissars that the enemy would shoot them if they surrendered . Now the Germans are . telling the same stories . For whatever reason , it is clear that the Red Army is fighting fiercely , with the same disregard for life the Nazis showed in Greece and Crete . Is this fanatical faith , patriotism or fatalism ? Dictatorships develop fatalism . People without responsibility , robbed of the power of choice , become inert , herd-like and indifferent to a degree that has to be seen to be understood . If Moscow falls , it will be by the weight of inertia . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the . solar plexus blow has released the dormant spirit of Russia itself , and that may be as cataclysmic as the effects of the last war .
