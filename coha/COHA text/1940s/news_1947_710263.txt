txt The committee House Ways and Means Committee concluded income tax reduction hearings today with the Republican majority brushing aside the question of whether the country 's new foreign policy was an obstacle to a cut . The issue was raised by former Chairman Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina toward the end of today 's session , which heard two New Yorkers who served as Under-Secretaries of the Treasury during the Roosevelt Administration endorse the proposed acrossthe-board slash of 20 per cent in personal income levies . Mr. Doughton , who wields considerable influence among members of both parties in the House , expressed for the first time his opposition to any substantial tax reduction now that " a dark cloud which certainly holds expenditure of tremendous sums hangs over Greece and over Turkey and over the world . " The chairman of the tax-writing during of Democratic control , pointed out that he had voted with the majority in the House 's approval of a $6,000,000,000 reduction in President Truman 's $37,500,000,000 budget for the next fiscal year , but said he did not see now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we know what our foreign commitments and expenditures will be . " Representative Wilbur D. Mills , Democrat , of Arkansas , who also voted for the $6,000,000,000 budget cut , likewise said that " subsequent events " led him to believe it would now be impossible to effect it . Representative Harold Knutson of Minnesota , the present chairman , ignoring the possible impact of the foreign situation on the tax deliberations , confidently predicted the committee would report out his tax-reduction bill by Thursday and said the House would take it up about March 24 for passage by the end of this month . Representative Thomas A. Jenkins of Ohio provided the only direct comment among Republican committeemen on the implications of President Truman 's request for $400,000,000 to bolster Greece and Turkey against Russian expansion . " Just because of this scare the President gave us a few days ago , " he said , " we are not at war with Russia . " Roswell Magill , law professor at Columbia University and chairman of the Committee on PostWar Tax Policy , and John W. Hanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City , were the two former Under-Secretaries of the Treasury who advocated an across-the-board tax cut of 20 per cent , as provided by the Knutson bill . They based their support upon the necessity to preserve free enterprise and maintain high productivity by removing the barriers to incentives for investment in new enterprises and for extra efforts by overtaxed individuals to increase their earnings . Both saw the possibility of an early business recession in the absence of a tax reduction . Maintaining that " we can continue to disregard the interest of the taxpayer only with the greatest peril " to the economy , Mr. Hanes especially emphasized the plight of taxpayers in high-income groups . who would receive the greatest amount of relief under the Knutson bill . Hanes Says Incentive Is Gone " The incentive in working and assuming . great responsibility is gone , " he said , adding : " I am making no plea for the rich or asking any mitigation of the tax burden they carry . What I do protest vehemently is a foolish and dangerous discrimination which has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What I protest is not a tax on wealth or income but a tax on brains  --  a stupid levy against the know-how and the managerial ex perience that are the nation 's greatest assets . " He said the present tax structure with its progressively higher rates on incomes by their size had placed " an effective ceiling on the efforts of individuals now of about $25,000 a year , " a limit which he said the late President Roosevelt had tried unsuccessfully to get Congress to impose . Representative Doughton brought in the matter of future foreign commitments during his questioning of Mr. Hanes , who replied that the country 's economic machine " will not carry the load of Greece or Turkey or the United States " unless it is put on a sound basis . Mr. Magill , whose testimony agreed with that of Mr. Hanes in most respects , said a 20 per cent across-the-board tax cut was " the best available method for stimulating incentive and business activity " to avert a recession which otherwise might " very possibly " come within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote of 12 to 5 to have the hearings opened by any witnesses who desired to appear . They charged the Republicans with limiting the testimony to witnesses of their own choosing .
