Bald , bashful , nervous Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau had mapped his campaign like a general getting ready for a spring offensive . He had stored up quantities of materiel for verbal war . His scouts had reconnoitered the House and Senate . This week , as his adding machines rolled forward , Mr. Morgenthau invaded Congress with the greatest army of tax proposals ever seen on earth . <P> His timing was perfect . U.S. taxpayers have started filing returns for 1941 . When they get a look at Mr. Morgenthau 's spring invasion , 1941 's record taxes will look like a minor skirmish with a band of Indians armed with bows &; arrows . <P> Congress dearly loves to harry Mr. Morgenthau with guerrilla tactics , to snipe at his rear with embarrassing questions , cut off his flanks with counterproposals . But this time General Morgenthau had not given Congress time to mobilize . Treasury and Congressional experts had worked out the campaign together . Mr. Morgenthau had smoothed the way for his Blitzkrieg by luncheons with big , ham-handed Chairman Robert L. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Means committee ( which starts the tax bill rolling ) and urbane Chairman Walter F. George of the Senate Finance Committee . With their help , Strategist Morgenthau thought that he could make it . <P> <P> The Treasury wanted more than the additional $7,000,000,000 the President had asked for in his budget message . Mr. Morgenthau suggested raising an estimated $8,145,000,000 in extra taxes , making the total 1942 tax burden more than $20,000,000,000 . Specifically : 1 ) an additional $3,350,000,000 from personal income taxes ; 2 ) $3,345,000,000 more from corporations ; 3 ) $1,450,000,000 more from excise taxes , gifts and estates .
