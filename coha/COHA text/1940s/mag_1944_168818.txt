Two learned Britons this week looked with foreboding and gloom at America 's prospects for postwar prosperity . <P> Harold Laski , radical economist , author and professor at the University of London , said in a transatlantic broadcast that he was " gloomy " about the future of the world " because I do not see how the free-enterprise system in America can lead to full employment . " <P> Radical Laski said that he saw little hope of avoiding a U.S. postwar depression " because the philosophy of the American businessman today seems to be exactly what it was in 1929 . " <P> Geoffrey Crowther , editor of the famed London Economist and of Transatlantic , the new London monthly which labors to explain the U.S. to the British , said : " American listeners should realize that we are more frightened of an American depression after the war than we are of a British depression . We want to be sure that America will not allow another gigantic depression . " <P> But while these Cassandras were busy , a number of highly encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good news was that the delegates from 45 nations , assembled at Bretton Woods , N.H. , came to substantial agreement on the organization of an $8,800,000,000 fund to stabilize postwar international exchange , and were driving toward agreement on a world bank to make long-term reconstruction loans . <P> Toughest problem in setting up the fund was the allotment of quotas determining what each nation should pay in and be able to draw out ( TIME , July 17 ) . After prolonged horse-trading these quotas were settled in a spirit of amity . <P> Though the fund is looked on with suspicion by the U.S. banking community in general and Senator Taft in particular ( see col. 1 ) , agreement on its principles among so many nations represents an achievement of the first order . The members of the United Nations now , at least , have a definite proposal before them in trying to re-establish world trade and prosperity . <P> Other developments on the optimistic side : <P> WPB took the first big step toward orderly reconversion ' from war to peace by releasing surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Economic Development 's second report on postwar prospects , published last week , turned out to be a calming assurance , at least for the early postwar years . <P> Harvard Economics Professor Sumner Slichter boldly prophesied a postwar boom that would probably overtax U.S. productive capacity .
