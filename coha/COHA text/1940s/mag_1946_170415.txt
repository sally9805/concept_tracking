How should war babies be brought up ? Last week an official proposal was made for the future of one of the most important : the $700 million synthetic-rubber industry , all Government owned . <P> Should it be operated by the Government ? Should it be turned loose to live or die ? Should it be kept alive in an incubator by tariff protection ? An interdepartmental committee , headed by popular red-faced William L. Batt , wartime rubber czar , tried to answer these questions . Its answer to all of them : No . The Batt committee hoped to turn the war baby into a healthy , unsubsidized and profit-making private industry . <P> The committee 's criterion of a satisfactory answer was that the U.S. should never again be caught as desperately short of rubber as it was in World War II . For the sake of efficiency the committee ruled out Government ownership ; proposed sale of the " basic " butadiene and copolymer plants to private industry . These are the main lot of low-cost producing units with a capacity of 450,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fringe " plants ( not planned as permanent ) are already being disposed of . <P> Dissolving the Pool . To avoid competition between Government and privately owned plants , sale of the basic plants would be postponed until sometime in 1947 , after the acute rubber shortage is past . Then , so far as possible , they would be sold all at once and to competitive companies . <P> At the same time that the basic plants are sold the patent pool under which the Government - built plants are now cross-licensed would be dissolved in order to give the new owners incentive for technological competition . <P> Would such a privately owned synthetic industry continue to grow and improve ? The committee hoped so , but as an aid it favored 1 ) a subsidy on rubber articles which contained synthetic , and 2 ) specifications requiring the use of synthetic in all essential articles in order to improve U.S. know-how for emergencies . <P> Actually the committee recommended no immediate legislation for the synthetic industry except the creation of a " rubber supervisory body " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee " it is quite possible that cost and quality improvements may be such as to enable synthetic rubber to compete in a free market with natural rubber after the latter is again in ample supply . " <P> This was no mere hope . The present price of synthetic rubber , 18 a lb. , is about the Government 's average cost of production in its high-and low-cost plants . Some of the basic plants have production costs as low as 13 a lb . If this cost can be further reduced and better synthetics gradually developed private industry should have a good chance of making money even when natural rubber comes down from its present abnormal high of 23.
