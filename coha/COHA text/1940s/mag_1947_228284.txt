Like the fisherman in The Arabian Nights , Detroit 's Federal Judge Frank A. Picard had unwittingly let the terrifying genie of portal-to-portal pay out of the bottle . By last week , as union claims swelled up to a terrifying $5 billion , Judge Picard set valiantly to work to lure the genie back in-or at least cut him down to a manageable size . <P> The genie , at that time safely encased in the bottle , first rolled up on the industrial shore in 1943 . Then , workers at Mt . Clemens Pottery Co. sued , under the Wages &; Hours Act , for time spent in the plant before the whistle blew . ( They were required to punch the time clock 14 minutes before the actual start of work , to give them time to walk to their benches , put on gloves , work clothes , etc . ) A special master threw out the claims , on the grounds that the workers had not proved how much of the time was actually spent in " makeready " tasks , i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Judge Picard overruled the master . He held that time spent on actual production before the starting whistle should be paid for . This the judge arbitrarily set at seven minutes a man , awarded the workers a total of $2,415.74 . This seemed a trifle , no more inportant than the puff of smoke that issued when the bottle was first opened . <P> But when the case reached the Supreme Court , the genie suddenly grew to enormous size . The Court held that Judge Picard was wrong , that all makeready and walking time on company property had to be paid for . Suddenly , the genie of portal-to-portal pay hovered , mountain high , not only over small Mt . Clemens Pottery , but over all industry . The oracular Court gave a hint , however , on how the monster might be lured back into the bottle . Under the legal doctrine of de minimis ( " the law does not concern itself with trifles " ) , all small amounts of makeready time were to be disregarded . With that , the Court handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , Judge Picard opened re-hearings on the Mt . Clemens case , to measure the trifles . It should have been easy . He had gone to the Mt . Clemens plant himself , to check on makeready practices from time clocks to work benches . He wanted everyone to agree that it took twelve seconds to put on an apron , 20 seconds to clean hands , that a man walked 275 ft. a minute , etc . But the company and union lawyers would not agree . Furthermore , they would not agree on which of these functions were trifles or on whether trifles should be added up to working time which had to be paid for . <P> Into Fairyland . For two harried days Judge Picard , an able , conscientious jurist , tried to get somebody to help him define a trifle . Nobody would . Judge Picard recalled that , before the Supreme Court decision , the company had claimed that it took 14 minutes to walk from the time clock to a workbench . The union had said it was only a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was only two minutes ; now the union said it was 15.
