In Los Angeles U.S. swim fans got their first look at a 20-year-old Japanese performer named Hironoshin Furuhashi . By week 's end they had decided that he was the best swimmer in the world . <P> Furuhashi and his teammates , barred from last year 's Olympics , had not only swum away with most of the honors at the A.A.U. championship meet , they had also broken world 's records right &; left . Speedster Furuhashi had set most of the new marks . <P> Bicycle Pedals . In one trial heat early in the meet , he swam the 1,500 meters ( just under a mile ) in 18 min. 19 sec. , beating the previous world 's record by more than a half-minute . That night , figuring that he would surely break the records for 800 and 1,000 meters on his way to an easy victory in the 1,500-meter final , dockers were ready to time him at those distances . But it was a teammate , Shiro Hashizume , who was ahead at 800 and 1,000 meters , and who set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the race . <P> Later , in the 800-meter final , Furuhashi broke Hashizume 's brand-new record by more than ten seconds , set a new mark for the 400-meter , and swam on the Japanese team that lowered the world-record time for the 800-meter relay . The Nipponese swept all the championship free-style swimming events except the 100-meter ( won by Bob Gibe of the Detroit A.C. ) . <P> U.S. experts went into a close study of the new Japanese swimming style , especially that of Prodigy Furuhashi . Instead of the standard six-beat leg kick , carefully synchronized with the arm strokes , he uses a slower , but very powerful kick which at times is not in rhythm with his arm movements at all . His arms revolve stiffly like bicycle pedals ; he rides low in the water and , especially to flabbergasted U.S. competitors , he looks like a weird , power-driven machine . <P> No Distractions . Aside from their kicks and strokes , the secret of Japanese swimming success appeared to lie in their ascetic , priestlike dedication to the sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no smokes , " no girls . " They go to bed at 9 p.m . Three times a day they take gymnastic exercises . <P> Furuhashi , who weighs 162 lbs . and stands 5 ft. 7 in. , has developed an imposing chest and tremendously muscular legs and arms . Every day , when he is not actually racing , he swims 4,000 to 10,000 meters . Hearing all this , a disgruntled U.S. swimmer said : " You call that amateur swimming ? It sounds to me like professionalism . " <P> Old Bob Kiphuth , famed Yale and Olympic coach , was more realistic : " This will shake the swimming world . "
