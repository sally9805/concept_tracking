Henry Cowell : Tales of Our Countryside ( All-American Orchestra , Leopold Stokowski conducting , with Composer Cowell at the piano ; Columbia ; 4 sides ) . Henry ( " Tone Clusters " ) Cowell has been noted chiefly as a composer-pianist who plays his ear-wrenching works partly with his fists and elbows . This composition is in a surprising , melodious vein that sounds somewhat like Sibelius . <P> Wagner : Bridal Chamber Scene from Lohengrin ( Victor Symphony , Edwin McArthur conducting , with Kirsten Flagstad , soprano , and Lauritz Melchior , tenor ; Victor ; 4 sides ) . Grade A performance and recording ; Flagstad at her finest . <P> Schumann : Frauenliebe und Leben ( Lotte Lehmann , soprano , with Bruno Walter at the piano ; Columbia ; 8 sides ) .
