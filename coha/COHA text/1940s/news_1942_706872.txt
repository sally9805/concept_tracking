txt Wars and other disasters bring together in a common job people who would n't otherwise know much about each other or who might not otherwise get on well together . Pearl Harbor , which was at once a disaster and the beginning of a war , did this for the United States . Those of us who write or make speeches have talked about national unity until we are tired of that phrase , as a phrase , and one supposes every one else is also tired of it . We are not tired of the reality behind the words . National unity , brought about by this war , that began a year ago today , does not mean that every individual in this nation has agreed to agree with every other individual , and every group with every other group . The old differences of opinion persist . There are still clashes of interest between city people and country people , people who work for wages and people who organize the work and meet the payrolls . We are a healthy , democratic nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing pains and will have more when there is time for them . Most of us realize that this is not the time for them . This is not the time for labor to be strengthened at the expense of ownership and management , or ownership and management at the expense of labor , or the farmer at the expense of the city man . National unity means domestic truce . On the whole , we have had that since Pearl Harbor . National unity is a large generality , difficult to see in its full dimensions . It comes down to relationships between persons . It means that men with such names as Shafer , Donnelly , Santina , Jenks , Klakring , Kramarewicz , Moran , Joseph , Bartek , Raff have teamed it together in gun crews , in landing parties and in bomber raids ; that men with names just as diversified have worked on the same lines in war factories ; that they have joked with each other , learned each other 's stories , troubles and ideas . Out of groups of half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families brought together by the work . the anxieties , the dangers or the griefs of war a united nation is built up . War has done this thing for us . We have a joint interest in a vast enterprise . We can not take the joy in it that we take in a Panama Canal , a Bonlder Dam , the rebuilding of Washington . the construction of continental highways . The waste of war , in life and goods , offends us . We have a deep respect for courage and skill , and are proud that our countrymen show these qualities in battle as they do in time of peace , but we have no instinct for glory . What we do surely have , collectively , is a determination to put all we are and possess into this necessary and unpleasant task . We go at it like a piece of engineering  --  which , mainly , it is . Our emotions are deep and not noisily expressed . Our minds are at work . We face great changes with composure . We know that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent alone but throughout the world . The knowledge steadies us and brings us together . So much for a year of war . If the war continues another year  --  and it would be rash to expect less  --  one can- not doubt that our determination and our unity will be even more conclusively demonstrated .
