Baptist Harry Truman was all set to receive an honorary LL.D . degree from Baptist Baylor University , of Waco , Tex . But from the Texas Baptist General Convention in Forth Worth last week came 4,500 " nays . " Said the chairman of the convention 's Civic Righteousness Committee in explanation : " No Baptist school should confer a degree on a man who likes his poker and drinks his bourbon . I know that we all agree that no man-even the President of the United States-could be a good Baptist and drink his liquor .
