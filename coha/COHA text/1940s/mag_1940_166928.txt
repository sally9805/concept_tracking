Mad as a wet hen last week was the Christian Century . This most influential U. S. Protestant weekly had been mad the week before , and the week before that , and the week before that . What made it mad was thinking about one thing-President Roosevelt 's Christmas appointment of Myron Charles Taylor as his personal ambassador to the Pope . The Christian Century disliked the appointment in the first place , liked it less when it appeared that the President had jockeyed Dr. George Arthur Buttrick , president of the Federal Council of Churches , into a position of apparent sympathy . The Christian Century was further irritated when the executive committee of the Federal Council issued a statement which seemed to approve the appointment , provided it was temporary and unofficial . Last fortnight , when Dr. Buttrick and two other Federal Council executives wired the Christian Century a denial that the appointment had been approved , the still fuming magazine said : " The Federal Council did not approve . Very well . What the 30,000,000 Protestant Americans in its constituency want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the Christian Century fumed on : " There is only one way out of the confusions and illegalities of this pseudo-ambassadorial appointment : let the President call Mr. Taylor home . If that would be too embarrassing , let him cancel whatever credentials have been delivered through the State Department and give him a letter of introduction which shall in substance say : The bearer is my friend , Mr. Myron Taylor , an eminent and respected private American citizen . Any courtesies extended to him and especially any information that may be conveyed through him regarding plans for peace will be appreciated by the undersigned . " <P> In the Vatican , day after this editorial appeared , Mr. Taylor was received by Pope Pius XII almost exactly as the Christian Century had ( however seriously ) suggested . In full evening dress and black spats , the Ambassador was ushered into the Hall of the Little Throne ( instead of the big hall of the Throne ) , where Pius XII awaited him . Instead of thrice genuflecting and kissing the papal ring , Mr. Taylor bowed twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . Then the Episcopal steelman handed Pius XII two letters . One was from Mr. Roosevelt to " Your Holiness , " in which he introduced Mr. Taylor as " a very old friend of mine ... in whom I repose the utmost confidence . " Through Mr. Taylor , the President sent " my cordial greetings to you , my old and good friend . " Both letters referred to the Ambassador simply as " a channel of communication . " <P> That was all . Pius XII and Mr. Taylor talked things over , in English , for half an hour . Then the Ambassador departed , began a lengthy round of ceremonial calls in Rome . First of 24 resident Cardinals on Mr. Taylor 's list was Gennaro Cardinal Granito Pignatelli di Belmonte , Dean of the Sacred College . Spry at 88 , this Prince of the Church returned the visit promptly , arrived at Mr. Taylor 's hotel ( the Excelsior ) flanked by two grooms , who went up in the elevator with him bearing two big lighted candles .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
