Tentative plans for the development , which will include about eighteen standard city blocks and cost $40,000,000 to $50,000,000 , will be submitted to the City Planning Commission in a few days , the Mayor declared , and will then go to the Board of Estimate , which must approve a contract between the city and the insurance company dealing with maintenance of the project . The apartment buildings , the Mayor said , will cover 30 per cent of the tract , the rest of the area being devoted to landscaping , roadways , open courts and other facilities for a maximum of light and air for tenants who will pay from $12 to $14 a room . The buildings are planned to house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosed in his radio talk that substantial progress had been made on two post-war projects , both of them included in the city 's $110,000,000 capital outlay program . Plans were about ready , he said , for a giant produce market on the site now occupied by the West Washington Market in lower Manhattan , while substantial progress had been made on the huge Idlewild airport on Jamaica Bay in Queens . The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company 's project also was an : . nounced by Frederick H. Ecker , president of the company , who said it would be " a sound investment possessing the additional element of constructive public value . " The project , he added , was initiated by and developed with the active cooperation of Mayor La Guardia and Park Commissioner Robert Moses . The housing development , the first to be put forward under the Urban Redevelopment Bill signed by Governor Dewey and intended to encourage private investment in rehabilitation of obsolete but potentially valuable city neighborhoods , will cover a section now occupied by old tenement houses , stores , factories , garages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dwindled from 27,000 in 1920 to about 11,000 now , according to Mayor La Guardia . Property Valued at $14 ; 000,000 The present total assessed valuation of property in the area is about $14,000,000 , the Mayor said , and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will pay taxes on that amount while the project is being operated under the contract between the city and the company.i It has been indicated that Ur con- , tract will cover a term of twenty years , after which revised assess- I ments will be applied . Mayor La Guardia said persons I living in the area need not worry about being dispossessed because no existing buildings , with a few exceptions , would to torn down until after the war . These exceptions , he said , would be buildings deemed unsafe for occupancy . According to the Mayor , persons in the lowincome groups will be accommodated , once the project is started , in one of the city 's low-cost housing developments . Mayor La Guardia revealed that the construction of the housing development would involve replacement of a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . Compensation would be provided , he said , for the churches and parochial schools , and new churches and schools would be established in the immediate neighborhood . " It is not only vision ; it is prudence and good business , " the Mayor said , after praising the insurance company for undertaking the project . " I say in all kindliness to the New York Life Insurance Company and Equitable Life and Mutual Life , that they should look into this housing proposition and the advantages it offers and they should also provide as much at least as the Metropolitan Life is doing in the area I have just described . " Commenting on the housing plan , Mr. Ecker said it would transform the area into a delightful residential community with excellent " walk to work " possibilities . There would be , he said , an atmosphere of park planning and a special emphasis on recreational needs of children . The new terminal market for ' fruit and vegetables , the ' Mayor said , would cover forty to fifty acres . It is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is hoped that its operation will reduce the cost of distribution of produce by a substantial ? amount per car . The Mayor said he would soon ask the Board of Estimate to make the necessary amendment to the capital budget for 1943 so that work might be started soon on engineering and architectural plans . Mayor La Guardia disclosed that a recent report to him on the prog-1 ress of the Idlewild Airport indicated that drainage and fill would be completed in a few months , after which work would be started on the huge runways , 10,000 feet long and 200 feet wide . The completed project , the Mayor said , would be the largest commercial air field in the world ; requests for space already have been received from foreign as well as domestic air lines . " And that is n't all that 's going on , " the Mayor declared . " We 're preparing a program for after the war , the like of which will put every city in this country to shame . " Mayor La Guardia read two communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York were not deteriorating , regardless of the findings of the Hanes Committee , recently made public by Governor Dewey . Letter from West Side Group " Existing business in New York is better in recent months than it has ? been in years , " said , , a letter sent to the Mayor by the West Side Association of Commerce and signed by Harold and Lee S. Buckingham . " While the Hanes Committee stated there bad been improvement since last July , the over-all impression given has been that business is falling off . The fact is that there has been an increase in employment of 200,000 persons since last Summer and unemployment in New York is now at its lowest point in years . " The letter credited the Mayor 's business advisory committee with persuading the Federal Government to recognize New York 's claims to recognition as a factor in war industry production . Another letter read by the Mayor was from an unidentified large real estate concern . " There are no pessimists in our ranks , " the letter said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City and we believe in New York City real estate . We know we can be of great service to banks , insurance companies and owners . " Mayor La Guardia said he had received thousands of letters in similar vein and scolded " the few who have some motive in trying to detract from New York ; in trying to give New York a bad reputation ; in trying to keep people away from New York . " Some of these people , the Mayor said , should be thankful to the city for the advantages it has provided for them . Later in his broadcast , after announcing that he had been told that the city 's quota of $12,920,000 for the Red Cross fund would be fully subscribed , the Mayor spoke of New York as " the prospering , thriving , successful , the happy city , always first in Red Cross or in war loans and in business and industry , finance , education and culture , " despite a few department stores " who are against New York City ; who abuse their very own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children have proper schools ; who are indifferent to the health and welfare of the people of this city . " Suggests an Oscar for Times Mayor La Guardia 's broadcast closed with the suggestion that an " Oscar , " similar to that presented I by the motion-picture industry , be awarded to THE NEW YORK TIMES . " I do n't know whether there is such a thing as an ' Oscar ' for fearless journalism and for the protection or for the courage to protect ' the rights of a free press , " he said . " If there is such an ' Oscar ' it would go this week to THE NEW YORK TIMES , for having the courage to resist the unlawful demands made by a combination of department stores , as indicated in an information filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York . Among other things , the department stores of New York City , including Macy 's , Bloomingdale 's and Abraham &; Straus , demanded a lower rate from THE NEW YORK TIMES and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed in the United States court to which they pleaded nolo , contendere and were found guilty and paid fines at maximum fines allowed by the law , to charge five cents a copy to the readers in New York City instead of three , and fifteen cents a copy for the Sun day TIMEs , instead of ten . " THE NEW YORK TIMES refused . I It lost its advertisements , but it retained its dignity and its honor and the conspirators who demanded that THE NEW YORK TIMES increase its rates to the people stood before the United States District Court on their plea of nolo contendere and were found guilty and the maximum fine was imposed . " You know , that 's THE NEW YORK TIMES we like to know . That 's THE NEW YORK TIMES thatl we 're accustomed to . THE NEW YORK TIMES which ' got its soul from Adolph Ochs , the brilliant , scintillating , keen NEW YORK1 TIMES of Rollo Ogden , THE TIMES of good manners and stately courtesy of John Finley . Congratulations , NEW YORK TIMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
