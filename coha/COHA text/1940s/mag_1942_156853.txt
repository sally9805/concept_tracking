The President called for his good right arm , and in Washington appeared swart Herbert H. Lehman to start work on the biggest civilian assignment of World War II . No more breathtaking than the title was the job-Director of Foreign Relief &; Rehabilitation ( TIME , Nov. 30 ) . <P> Herbert Lehman 's mission was to follow up each Allied victory with food , clothing , medicine and more-tools for conquered peoples to build a new life out of Axis desolation . He would use food to relieve the starving , as Herbert Hoover did in World War I. But Lehman also would use it as psychological ammunition to help win the war . To subject nations the world over would go the word that bread and meat were on the way , once the Axis yoke was cast off . His job was not to stop with victory , but to advance behind United Nations troops with blueprints for the economic reconstruction of Europe 's **25;9415;TOOLONG millions . Food , clothes and shelter , Lehman knew , would not alone build a lasting peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet as free-functioning economic units . <P> This was no mere war philanthropy . Liberated North and West Africa are rich in palm oils , some foodstuffs , but short of cloth and other manufactured goods . Here the U.S. may trade resources . Across the Mediterranean , unliberated Italy is hungry , war-weary . Here the promise of food and a peace with security might help open a beach head for Allied occupation . Around the world , as the Axis conquerors are rolled back , the plan is to supply every nation with its needs , toward an economic stability more permanent than the ruins of the peace that followed World War I. <P> For the moment Lehman 's task is to plan in liaison with Army , Navy , State Department , Treasury , Lend-Lease Administration , Board of Economic Warfare , War Shipping Administration and inter-Allied committees now functioning . The world is their workshop-and the U.S. is cast for the dominant post-war role . <P> Said Herbert Lehman , turned 64 , " I consider this the greatest opportunity for service ever offered to me or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Come back and see me a year from today . "
