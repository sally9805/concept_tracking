Jim Montgomery remembers Nov. 15 , 1923 very clearly . He had just quit his steel-hustling job at a Waukegan machine plant and was having a game of 10 black ball at the Aggressor Pool Hall with his friend , Finis Moore . But Jim and Finis got to arguing and suddenly they were heaving pool balls at each other . <P> Jim 's wife , Sentoria , heard about it and came rushing down to take him home . But she could n't keep him there-Jim strolled back to the poolroom for a while , then sauntered over to the Busy Bee for a cup of coffee . That was when the cops came . They hauled Jim to Waukegan jail and started talking . " All right , you black son-ofabitch , tell the truth , " demanded one . " We know you done it . " <P> " Done what ? " asked Jim . " Raped that white woman , " the cop replied . That , swears Jim Montgomery , was the first he knew that he was in real trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Waukegan 's squalid Negro district , had been found , beaten and moaning , near the Oakwood cemetery . Mamie vowed that she had been raped and the police told Jim that she had named him as her attacker . <P> One Day True . At first , Mamie was a little confused about identifying Jim . ( It was " forgetfulness , " explained relatives , a trait which made it necessary several years later to send Mamie to the Elgin State Hospital for the insane , where she died in 1947 . ) But later she got quite positive about it . At the police station , Montgomery recalls , he was beaten up by the cops and the prosecutor told him , " if you were down in Georgia or Mississippi ... we would turn you over to the K.K.K. , and we are liable to do it up here . " The Ku Klux Klan was strong in the Midwest in those days . Jim Montgomery 's trial , on a capital charge , lasted only one day . The prosecution offered no convincing medical proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was sent to Joliet for life . <P> In prison , Montgomery tried to make the most of his ride on the slow train to nowhere . He struck up a friendship with a more famous prisoner , Nathan ( " Bebe " ) Leopold of Chicago 's sensational Leopold &; Loeb slaying , and from him learned how to read and write . After that he kept pretty much to himself , read a lot and spent his leftover time hoping for justice . <P> Back home in Waukegan , Sentoria Montgomery did more than hope . She worked part-time as a cook , spent about $7,000 of her own and her brother 's money trying to get her husband out of prison . For 24 years she found only frustration ; but two years ago she found Luis Kutner , a flashy , wealthy Chicago lawyer . <P> After Kutner took the case ( he likes to take on " charity cases " which intrigue him ) , he discovered that all important court records were destroyed or missing . But Lawyer Kutner 's investigators did obtain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waukegan the day after the crime . It showed that Mamie Snow had not been raped . The prosecution , ruthlessly bent on convicting him , had suppressed the report .
