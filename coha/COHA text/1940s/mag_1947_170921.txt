The Homestretch ( 20th Century-Fox ) canters in Technicolor through the not particularly fascinating vicissitudes of a raffish racing man ( Cornel Wilde ) , his Back Bay bride ( Maureen O'Hara ) and his somewhat Bohemian girl friend ( Helen Walker ) . Miss O'Hara wants Wilde to settle down and stop living out of Miss Walker 's pocket ; she also tends to misunderstand the free- &-easy; way these old friends kiss each other . <P> Meanwhile , three horses , one for each principal , do a lot of running , over a plethora of courses in England , South America and the U.S. They are nobly beautiful animals and interesting to watch . But for all their running , they can not parlay Homestretch into anything better than just another race-track picture . <P> Ramrod ( United Artists ) is a pretty , mildly sluggish western about a very bad woman ( Veronica Lake ) , a very good one ( Arleen Whelan ) , a good man ( Joel McCrea ) and a rat ( Preston Foster ) . The main problems : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Ruggles ) , Foster and his hard guys , in her determination to graze her cattle on land they forbid her ? and 2 ) Which girl will ultimately throw and brand McCrea ? <P> The movie has its moments-a night stampede along a cliff , several brutal fights and killings , and a long , tense stalking sequence , with rifles , in a pitch-dark canyon . It also has more than its quota of good performances , notably by Wally Cassell , Donald Crisp , Don DeFore , Lloyd Bridges . Best of all , it is finely set and photographed ( by Allan O'Dea and Russell Harlan ) and carefully directed ( by Miss Lake 's husband , Andre de Toth ) . <P> The landscapes and shacks have a remoteness seldom appreciated in films ; it has even occurred to someone that the noise of blowing leaves is pleasant . Such careful details help bring the audience deeper into the country . Ramrod is decently made , nice to look at , and at times exciting . Unluckily the story is long , complicated and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lavished on it .
