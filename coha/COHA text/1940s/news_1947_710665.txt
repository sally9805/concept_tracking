txt The main issue at the Rio  --  or Petropolis  --  conference could not be put oil the agenda . It was not whether the American nations could agree on a hemispheric defense plan . It was not whether the economic implications or consequences of such a plan should be ' I discussed at this or at a later meeting . It was not whether there could be harmony between the United States and most of the other nations of this hemisphere . It was to what extent Argentina would play her part in a grand project for hemispheric cooperation . If such cooperation could be obtained and loyally continued , differences could be smoothed out , the level of living in the economically backward areas of the hemisphere might be raised and we could hope for progress toward greater freedom in the poi/ti:ally backward areas . The issue has not been settled . But we do have to note two disquieting developments  --  one at Petropolis and one relating to the domestic affairs of Argentina herself . At Petropolis , Argentina tried to whittle down the Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use common military force only if an attack came from outside the Americas . The actual agreement made at Chapultepec in March , 1945 , clearly specified an attack by one American nation on another as justifying united action in the common defense . It may be that Argentina feels that this item in the Chapultepec declaration was directed at her . There were suspicions then , as there are now , of her Government 's ultimate intentions . Yet the general and honest hope ' was and is that she intends to keep her promises and live at peace with her neighbors . There is always a sure way to esca being treated as an aggressor , and that would be not to act like one . The domestic aspect of the Argentine policy has nothing to do with the present conference , yet it has a bearing on Argentina 's  --  or President PerOn'sgood faith . At the very time that the Argentine delegation at Petropolis was applauding Secretary Marshall 's declaration that " we must reject encroachment upon the fundamental rights of the individual with the same determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , " PerOn 's Ministry of Information was suspending a newspaper in Buenos Aires because it dared to criticize his Government and his wife . There was provocation . Some of the attacks on Senor Peron and his entourage may be in bad taste and prob- , ably some are . extreme . But obscure weeklies , like the one in question , are not the only sufferers . President Peron is not keeping the promises he recently made to restore full liberty to the press and people of Argentina . He has , indeed , given an aura of legality to some of his steps , as when he suspended exchange permits for newsprint purchased abroad , introduced a bill to limit the size of newspapers , and established a commission to investigate the newspapers ' sources of income and their observance of labor laws . But these moves had the effect of penalizing three of this hemisphere 's greatest newspapers , La Prensa , La Nacion and El Mundo , all of which have opposed him . American criticism of Argentine policy , domestic and foreign may injure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iris ever intended to do so . On the contrary , it is the very advances that Argentina has made that lead us to expect good things from her and disappoint us when the good things do not materialize . We can understand why arbitrary governments have arisen in some Latin-American states with large indigenous populations not yet educated to modern life . In understanding such situations we need not sympathize with repressive Methods , but we can hope for improvement . But there is no such situation in Argentina . Its people , like ours , are almost wholly of European stock . They are the material upon which a democratic commonwealth can be erected . They are not driven by desperation to follow fascist models . We believe that the American people , and the peoples of all the Western countries that have democracy , or are struggling toward it , would welcome Argentina 's sincere and unreserved cooperation in a pan-American plan . We could even forget a good deal in President PerOn 's past record if he would turn his steps in that direction .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
