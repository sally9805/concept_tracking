Shrewd little Premier Adelard Godbout last week introduced in Quebec 's legislature a bill to : 1 ) create a five-man Hydroelectric Commission , thereby putting the Province in the power business ; 2 ) expropriate , by April 15 , the $210,000,000 Montreal Light , Heat &; Power Cons . Said he : " This bill will change the economic life of the Province . " <P> Along narrow St. James Street ( Canada 's Wall Street ) in Montreal , financiers twitched and twittered : this was a step toward nationalization of all Quebec 's water power , which generates 53% of Canada 's hydroelectricity . There was nothing the financiers or the company 's shareholders could do about it except argue about the allotted payment for their holdings . <P> Plus whatever honest interest Premier Godbout had in cheap public power , he was clearly bidding for reelection . He was well aware that his French-Canadian constituents were in a mood to applaud any blow at the trustards , Quebec 's epithet for the English-Canadian capitalists who control much of the Province 's industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
