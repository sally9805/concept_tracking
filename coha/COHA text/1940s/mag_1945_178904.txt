The course was paying off . To Pupils Penick and Goss came payments for short stories from Collier 's and the Atlantic Monthly ; to Pupils Morgan and Flynn came advances from Publishers Farrar &; Rinehart . These were new testimonials to Teacher Hudson Strode of the University of Alabama and his course in creative writing , English 117-118-119 . <P> Last week , having just finished revising his own eight-year-old South By , Thunderbird , * a journal of a South American plane trip , 51-year-old Professor Strode could take time out to puff away at his pipe and look at the record . Although he says of his course , " We do not write to sell , and I think a lot of the best stuff has not sold at all , " the record has an exceedingly successful ring to it : Pupil John Mayo Goss 's check from the Atlantic was for a short story , Bird Song ; the 50-year-old ex-adman 's story was the 25th to be sold by a Strode student . <P> Pupil Roy Flynn 's check from Farrar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 ) man 's first novel and winner of the $1,000 Stephen Vincent Bent Scholarship ; it was scheduled for publication next spring , and was the 14th novel accepted from a Strode student . <P> Clinics &; Visits . When would-be novelist Harriet Hassell came to him for help in 1937 , brisk Professor Strode , no novelist himself , remarked skeptically : " I do n't believe a person can be taught to write a novel " - then added : " but we 'll see what happens . ' " The result , Rachel 's Children , went into four printings . Since then Hudson Strode , a full professor at Alabama since 1924 ( specialty : Shakespeare ) has been busy teaching students to write about what they know . <P> Professor Strode does not believe that everybody can be taught how to write . He restricts his four-session-a-week " clinic " to those who he thinks have genuine latent talent ; twelve to 14 is the usual number . They read no textbooks , hear no lectures , spend their entire time writing , revising , polishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments . <P> On occasion , students visit Strode 's country retreat for discussion , with hunting &; fishing trips on the side . They also go to his home , just outside Tuscaloosa , for conferences with him and his wife , who assists him in appraising manuscripts . <P> Passion &; Variety . Alabaman Strode has an almost fanatical faith in the cultural present and future of the South . He takes great pride in the fact that all but four of his 14 students who have sold novels come from within 100 miles of Tuscaloosa . <P> With the war 's end ( seven of his students are in the Navy ) , and the South 's gradual economic liberation from the North , Hudson Strode predicts a great regional renascence . For , he declares , " there is more passion , more sentiment , more grace , and more variety in the South than in any other section of the nation .
