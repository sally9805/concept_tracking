He said : " The House will not expect me to say anything about the other French ships which are at large except that it is our inflexible resolve to do everything possible in order to prevent them from falling into German hands . " What the British arc ready to do was shown plainly at Oran , Algeria , where the French commander resisted the British terms . The biggest naval battle of the war developed on the spot . Confident on Outcome The British felt confident that the French ships at Alexandria would not fall to Germany or Italy Mr. Churchill told Parliament that the French force , including an undisclosed number of battleships , four cruisers and a number of smaller ships , had been " informed that they can not be permitted to leave harbor and thus fall within the power of the German conquerors of France .

All British ships came through in fighting trim with undisclosed losses to personnel that are be- By Saville R. Davis Stag Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor ROME , July ** chief significance of the British naval action of Oran , Algeria , was that the Italian fleet did not contest it . This fact overshadowed the actual seizure of the French fleet which had been taken for granted here ever since the armistice was signed . The Italian reticence is indeed the outstanding feature of the Mediterranean war today . Since the Italian declaration of war on June 10 there has been no major engagement with the British cithci by land , sea , or air . There is a growing conviction among neutral observers here that Italy aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible unspent . This policy involves strategic losses , such as were accepted by not impeding the British in their bold dash to Oran Tuesday It might call for complacence in the face of more naval raids of this character . But Italians are confident that Germany will shortly conquer the British Isles and attack British resistance at its source . Ancient Roman Tactics Thus they have adopted on a grand scale the strategy of Fabius Maximus , the Consul and dictator of Rome in 216 B.C. who was known as " Cunctator " or delayer as the result of his tactics during the second Punic War . A great deal of what is happening today can thus be recalled from the manner in which Fabius , as a Roman General , dealt with Hannibal when the two Mediterranean Empires were locked in struggle . Fabius considered the risks of battle too high at the outset . Therefore he marched , countermarched , delayed , harassed , and finally isolated Hannibal , cutting off his sources of supply , thus saving Rome for final victory over Carthage. lay exercising similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly improved The French Army , the bulk of the French Mediterranean colonies , and several links in the British alliance systems with Mediterranean neutrals have broken under the strain of German victories . Excepting for local engage- ments , Italy 's forces remain intact . There are heavy advantages in this strategy , especially for a younger nation which has already fought two wars in Ethiopia and Spain , and has sought to re-equip itself under exceptionally difficult circumstances . The fact of not plunging in when other nations are pouring their armaments into lightning warfare would raise Italy 's comparative strength and standing more than all its factories with unlimited raw materials could do in years of effort . Navies and mechanized armies are built slowly , but wasted fast . Even if Italy continues in its passive role , it will render its Axis partner a major service . It is today dividing the British Navy and Air Force as five weeks ago it divided the French Army . On this point one of the most significant footnotes has been furnished by German and Italian semi-official commentators since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , but could not be confidently stated : Namely that it was with full GerI man concurrence that Italy merely held the French forces divided and did not assume the risks of total attack . Economy of Means Economy of means , it is argued , has been the cardinal German military principle since Sept. 4 . No more force was expended at any time than the immediate action re quired . The remaining forces were husbanded for the larger tasks to come . So long as the French Army was split , it made no essential difference to the German drive on the Weygand Line whether the Italians caused heavy fighting on the South or not . Therefore they did not . It is. of course , impossible to predict how long this Fabian strategy will now continue to be applied to the war with Britain in the Mediterranean , or whether it will be successful . There are tactical arguments in addition to those of glory which have caused some observers to expect an effort to bring about a showdown . Italy , they say , could first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preliminary effort to level British superiority in capital and heavy ships , which is now more than three to one . Such efforts might become particularly important from the Axis viewpoint if Britain started withdrawing important units to use against Germany in home defense . In any event , many think that until the British Navy is cleared out of the way , land action could be carried out across the broad band of tortuous , waterless desert between Libya and Egypt only with great difficulty . The terrain almost requires naval support . Nevertheless , Italy 's improved position tinder the preliminary stages of Fabian strategy has been thus far more than satisfactory . I As the days pass it becomes increasingly unlikely that it will be abandoned until the effect of Germany 's attack on Britain can be observed . Fascist Propaganda Meanwhile the Fascist press made what propagandist capital it could today , out of the Battle of Oran authoritative Italian sources called the British action against France 's fleet a " brutal and cynical act .
