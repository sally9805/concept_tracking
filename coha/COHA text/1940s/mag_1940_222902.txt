His dumpy , round-faced Grace , Dr. William Temple , Archbishop of York , last week roundly declared : " We are fighting for Christian civilization . I can not use the phrase ' holy war , ' for war in its own nature is always an expression of the sin of man . But without hesitation I speak of this as , for us , a righteous war . " <P> Dr. Temple , a prelate who is much more highly esteemed by world churchmen than his superior , the Archbishop of Canterbury ( see p. 25 ) , is a sober theologian , a leader in the ecumenical ( interchurch ) movement , with many friends in the U. S. One friend , Reinhold Niebuhr of Manhattan 's Union Theological Seminary , lately returned from a long stay in England . Dr. Niebuhr drafted , and some of his colleagues rewrote , a statement in which , this week , the Archbishop of York 's position was strongly echoed , over the signatures of 33 of the nation 's most influential Protestants . <P> These Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and by most of the Roman Catholic press* ) : " That , since all war is unChristian , Christians in neutral nations should not discriminate between belligerents . . . that Christian citizens of nations at war are disloyal to their Christian faith if they give support to their Governments or armies . " This view , said the signers , " seems to us to be due to intellectual confusion and to tend toward moral callousness and national self-righteousness and irresponsibility . " In full agreement with most Allied churchmen , the 31 affirmed : <P> " For the ultimate causes of the conflicts in both Europe and Asia all nations , including our own , must share responsibility . This admission of common guilt as regards the origins of the wars must not blind us to the incalculable issues at stake in the outcome of these wars . . . . An interpretation of the present conflicts as ' merely a clash of rival imperialisms ' can spring only from ignorance or moral confusion . The basic distinction between civilizations in which justice and freedom are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthless tyranny can not be ignored . ... To suggest that nothing of consequence is at stake in the success of Japanese , German and Russian designs on China , Czecho-Slovakia , Poland and the Baltic States , or in the successful resistance of these latter nations , is to be guilty of moral irresponsibility. . . .
