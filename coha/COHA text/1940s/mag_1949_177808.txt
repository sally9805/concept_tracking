SAN MARINO <P> The devil was back in San Marino . <P> Sixteen hundred and forty-eight years ago , the Dalmatian stonecutter Marinus arrived on the rocky slopes of Mount Titano , in central Italy , drove out the fat brown bears who inhabited the mountain , and founded the republic now known as San Marino . To lead a counterattack against Marinus , the story goes , the ursine exiles selected a huge black bear , who was actually Satan in disguise . Marinus lured the devil bear to the edge of a precipice and thrust a wooden cross in his face . The evil one went up in sulphurous smoke . <P> Last week the Catholic bishops of the Italian dioceses of Rimini and Montefalco , who supervise the spiritual welfare of the world 's oldest and smallest republic ( 38 sq . mi. ; pop . 12,000 ) , in a pastoral letter called on St. Marinus to combat Beelzebub 's latest manifestation-a Communist-sponsored gambling casino . <P> Blue Neon Sign . The Communist-Socialist coalition , which has ruled San Marino since 1945 , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by devoting one-third of its budget to WPA-style public works . This year , with its credit exhausted and the budget at a record 530 million lire ( $923,500 ) , the government desperately needed money to meet a new 200 million lire deficit . <P> At first , the republic 's Communist boss , lean , saturnine ex-Partisan Gildo Gasperoni , publicly decried the suggestion that San Marino become another Monte Carlo to lure money from free-spending capitalists . " This means the end of a tradition , " he said with hands raised before his eyes . But in the end , Gasperoni and his Communists pushed the plan through . <P> A combine of Genoese financiers forked over 100 million lire down-payment for a nine-year gambling concession , agreed to build a casino and put up a 100-room hotel . <P> Last week , a brilliant blue neon sign and the suspenseful whirr of roulette wheels heralded the opening of San Marino 's casino , temporarily quartered in the Kursaal , the republic 's one concert hall . There was a quiet champagne party for 300 local officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy ) smoothly took charge of the casino 's five roulette and two baccarat tables . <P> To some San Marinese , the promise of new prosperity was all that counted . Among antiCommunists , the casino was a sharp political issue . They were convinced that behind the casino 's gaming tables stood a menace to San Marino 's independence , a mysterious Rumanian known locally as Maximo Maxim . <P> Long-Distance Calls . Maxim , a squat , balding little man , is listed in the official registry of landlocked San Marino as head of a shipping firm . He moved in a year and a half ago , lives quietly with his mistress in a rented stone bungalow . He wears yellow velvet gloves , talks more on the long-distance telephone than anyone else in the republic . From the Convent of St. Francis , Maxim has been seen slipping into the Communist casino 's back door . A black-bearded monk summed up the general suspicion . " Here in San Marino , " he said , " there exists Bolshevism in yellow velvet gloves , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
