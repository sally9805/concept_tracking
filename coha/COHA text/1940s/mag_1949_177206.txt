Onetime President Getulio Vargas has been on leave from the Brazilian Senate for more than a year . But to his tiny , yellow stucco ranch house in remote southwest Rio Grande do Sul comes an endless stream of well-wishers , politicos , favor-seekers and givers of advice . Three and a half years after the revolution that broke his 15-year rule , the wily ex-dictator is again the political personage of the hour . <P> In Brazilian cities , posters proclaim : " He will return . " Below the legend is a price list showing that rice , beans and other basic necessities of Brazilian life now cost twice what they did in Getulio 's time . Getulio himself has made no move . Yet he is so widely discussed for the 1950 presidential elections that most political maneuvers in Brazil lately have had one theme : stop Getulio . To further that end by bolstering his own sagging prestige , President Eurico Caspar Dutra recently announced plans for a visit to the U.S. <P> Last week TIME Correspondent William White called on Vargas at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short-legged little man deeply tanned from days in the saddle , a picture of health at 65 . O Presidente wore a faded blue shirt tucked into a gaucho 's baggy blue bomachos . <P> Green Pastures . Vargas led the way slowly into the house , sat down near the door . There was not a picture on the wall , nor a rug on the floor . Over the unpainted table , bare except for letters and newspapers lying on a small radio , hung a naked light bulb . In the adjoining room stood a metal bed , a lavender-colored wardrobe , a few nondescript wooden chairs . " My parents were farmers , " Vargas began . " Now that I am an old man , it is good to be back in my childhood scenes . " <P> When he was asked to discuss U.S.Brazilian relations , Vargas was silent for fully two minutes as he toyed with an unlit cigar , crumpled a handkerchief , and looked out across his rolling pastures . Then he said : " Roosevelt trusted me . He believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil would make a strong ally-a good customer . We were right when we had that point of view . " <P> The careful mind ticked on slowly . " Brazil has two urgent problems Americans could help with-transport and farm machinery . All the rest of Brazil 's problems can be solved by its government-if there is more administration and less politics . " <P> Red Problem . Did O Presidente approve the government 's outlawing of the Communists ? This time the pause was longer . A chicken scurried across the floor . Then : " We should have followed the example of the U.S. Communism would have got nowhere as a political party . " <P> There was one more question : " If the people themselves should demand your return to office , would you run for the presidency ? " Vargas squirmed . He twisted a box of matches around in his hands . He looked out the door . Finally he said : " The Brazilian people are suffering , particularly the workers . The crisis , in time , may pass . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a younger man than I. " In short , Getulio Vargas did not answer the question as bluntly as the posters .
