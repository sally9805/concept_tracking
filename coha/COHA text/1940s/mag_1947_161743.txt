Two Governments last week put up for sale one of the costliest flops of the war : the $135,000,000 Canol oil project of the U.S. in northern Canada . <P> The U.S. has no peacetime use for the 600-mile pipeline from oilfields at Norman Wells , N.W.T. across the Mackenzie Mountains to a refinery at Whitehorse , Yukon . Neither has Canada . So Canada agreed to let the U.S. sell its plant and pipeline to private buyers-if it could find any . In two years ' time , if there are no takers , the plant and equipment will be abandoned .
