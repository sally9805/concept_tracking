THE PHONES never stop ringing at the information desk in the main entrance hall of United Nations headquarters at Lake Success , Long Island . Within ten minutes one of the information girls recently gave a detailed explanation of the veto to a youngster doing his homework , listed in French the last four countries to become members of the United Nations , and forwarded to the reference library a question about the present official flag of Germany . She picked up another phone , listened for a moment , and said : " I 'm sorry , Madam , but I 'm afraid I ca n't give you the names of all the unmarried men among the UN delegates . . . " These were typical of the questions that the girls sitting behind the long information desk are expected to answer . All of them are college graduates who speak at least two languages . A sign proclaims that Chinese , English , Spanish , French , Dutch , Polish , Portuguese , and Russian " are spoken here " ; but most frequently they speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant use that the girls have now begun to chat among themselves in a strange private jargon that they like to call " Fringlish " . Answering queries from the curious public is one of the smaller details of housekeeping for the family of nations . For behind the United Nations General Assembly , and the current meetings of the Security Council , the Atomic Energy Commission , and the like , is a tightly-knit , smoothly-running force of 2,700 international civil servants , who already have begun to develop the characteristics of a family group . They form the UN Secretariat . Without them , the United Nations could not operate for a single day . In one year the Secretariat has grown from a handful of experts into a complex community ? self-sufficient in economists , lawyers , electricians , plumbers , political experts , and sociologists . It has its own carpenter and paint shops , post office , print shop , branch bank office , restaurant and cafeteria , clinic , and bus terminal . Late last summer the Secretariat set up housekeeping about eighteen miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sperry Gyroscope factory at Lake Success , Long Island . For most UN workers this means at least two hours of traveling each day from their homes to the sprawling cluster of flat-topped , rectangular factory buildings where the UN will remain until its permanent headquarters are built along Manhattan 's East River .  | The barren grounds and tan brick walls of Sperry have been somewhat relieved by a cautious scattering of trees . The fifty-five UN flags neatly circling a grass plot at the main entrance add a much-needed splash of color . But the first glimpse of the UN is the impression that sticks ? the drab , vast parking space , the ugly buildings with their harsh line of glass brick above the small windows . Inside is a claustrophobe 's nightmare . What was once a huge open factory space with skylights has been broken up , foot by foot and layer by layer , into three floors of cubbyholes . The result is a labyrinth of cream-and-green concrete walls , steel partitions , low ceilings , and endless corridors . Few of the offices have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sperry Gyroscope Company and the UN now live side by side , friendly but aloof neighbors , whose only common problem is fire protection . Sperry still pursues its mysterious business on the larger part of the factory grounds ? presumably manufacturing bomb sights and other precision instruments . Its plant is separated from the UN by an eight-inch fire wall and a tile barrier topped with wire fencing . II FROM their first day on American soil , Secretariat officials were beset by demands which might make the boldest executive quiver . Meetings of the Security and Economic and Social Councils were called immediately requiring expert interpreters , stenographers , and typists in four languages : English , French , Russian , and Spanish . A small army of clerks , mimeograph operators , guards , and ushers had to be mobilized overnight . The miracle of gathering such a staff ? which subsequently operated with amazing efficiency ? was accomplished by hiring people already located in the New York area . Consequently more than half the Secretariat employees are Americans , a fact which has brought loud complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people from other countries , and recruiting offices have been opened in England , Switzerland , Australia , New Zealand , Brazil , Canada , South Africa , and India . Personnel officials estimate it will take two years to organize a competent , geographicallybalanced staff . Housing the personnel who have come from other countries has already become a problem . UN employees ? including many with four and five children , and one brave South American who arrived with his wife and eight sons ? are scattered in makeshift quarters in hotels , rooming houses , private homes , and apartments all over Long Island and the neighboring metropolis . A large number simply left their families back home for the present . Three special UN housing projects arc under construction ; when completed they will accommodate 1,100 families . UN has also taken a lease on the Lido Beach Hotel , a Long Island resort with a private beach and rooms facing the ocean . Four hundred employees have been housed there . Single rooms cost them $3.50 a day , with suites running as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beach to Lake Success . 0NE LARGE section of the Secretariat in which Americans do not predominate is the Languages Division , the pivot of all UN activities . Here , in tiny , cell-like offices , dwell the interpreters ? a truly astonishing collection of mental wizards and linguistic virtuosi . Because of their haughty manner and highstrung temperaments they are often referred to by other members of the Secretariat as " les diplomates rates , " or ( freely translated ) " **27;552;TOOLONG . " Many worked for the League of Nations . Most are French or have lived in France for some time . Those who speak Russian are usually the children of Russian parents who lived in France or are themselves emigres from the Soviet Union , since the Soviet has been unable to spare any linguists to UN . French and English are the working languages of UN , which means that every last one of the millions of words officially written or spoken must be in both languages . Since Spanish delegates frequently , and Russian delegates almost always , speak in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | prized . Although Chinese is never spoken by the Chinese delegates , all of whom handle English fluently , it is the fifth " official " language . The acknowledged master among the interpreters , at least in graces and flourishes , is Andrew Kaminker , a short , stout , bald Frenchman . He has been known to rise immediately after an hour-long speech and translate it without a note or whimper of pain , speaking with such gestures and dramatic force that listeners frequently get the illusion that he delivered the speech in the first place . Equally talented , if not quite so colorful , is his brother Georges , a small , soft-spoken gentleman famed for his extraordinary ability to translate with awesome precision the most complicated technical data . Both operated freelance until they joined UN , and have attended all international conferences worth attending for the last twenty-five years . None of the interpreters takes notes in shorthand . They say it would only confuse them . As a rule , they take surprisingly few notes . Each interpreter has his own system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word or two there , but they rely almost entirely on their phenomenal memories . Although they try to reproduce speeches virtually verbatim , their goal is to render the gist of the argument correctly and lucidly . " We are not the cigarette machine where one deposits the coin , and a box of cigarettes and matches slides out , " one interpreter explained . " We try to avoid possible incidents , we look for suitable words without being offensive . This is particularly true with the Russians , who like to quote proverbs and sayings . A literal translation would not make sense . " For him , the atmosphere around New York , in contrast to that at Paris last summer , has been calm . " One day at Paris for example , " he said , " the New Zealand delegate became very angry with what he regarded as Russian delay tactics , and made a vehement speech . We conveyed t general idea that he was n't terribly pleased , but avoided translating the assorted epithets . Although practically everyone understood English , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jugoslav delegate , in the fire of debate , spilled a glass of water on the head of his interpreter , sitting just below him . What did the interpreter do ? Of course he went right on speaking ! " GUERRILLA war is currently being waged at UN between two schools of interpretation . The group to which the Kaminker brothers belong , for instance , are known technically as " consecutive " interpreters . They wait until a delegate is finished speaking to translate his speech . When the original speech is in Russian , it must be translated twice ? into French and English . The other group , the ' simultaneous " interpreters , are viewed strictly as carpetbaggers by the consecutive school . In simultaneous interpretation , the original speaker 's words are translated while he talks by a team of interpreters , sitting in glass-enclosed booths and speaking through microphones , in the other four official languages of the UN . Listeners are equipped with headphones and a radiolike dial so that they can tune in on the language they understand best . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their chief , Colonel Leon Dostert , were firmly entrenched by the end of the last Assembly , though they remain officially outside of the Languages Division . Since simultaneous interpretation is only a word or two behind the original speaker , a one hour speech with simultaneous interpretation can be disposed of in an hour flat . Consecutive interpretation , on the other hand , may take up to two and a half hours for the same speech . The one committee room at Lake Success outfitted with the expensive equipment necessary for simultaneous interpretation saved one hundred and fifty hours , and all six committees competed for its use during the recent Assembly meetings . Before the next Assembly , four more rooms will have simultaneous interpretation equipment . Dostert is now experimenting with individual radio receiving sets to be worn on a strap around the listener 's neck , for use in large halls where the Assembly or Security Council meet . Each set , weighing less than a pound , will have seven channels , individual volume control , and earphones attached . With such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step outside the door a few feet , or even eat a sandwich in the corridor , and still hear the proceedings . The Colonel is afraid of only one thing : listeners with kleptomaniac proclivities would find it simple to slip the set under their coats and walk out , carrying part of the UN with them . Dostert , a small , lively Frenchman with a dapper black moustache , is now an American citizen . As a colonel in the U. S. Army , he was in charge of simultaneous interpretation at the Nuremberg trials ( they were conducted in four languages . ) Although simultaneous interpretation was tried twenty-five years ago at the League , he feels that the UN provided its first real chance to prove its worth . " Every new idea has to struggle , especially when it strikes against the interests of certain groups of people , " he says cheerfully . " At the beginning people used to smile and think we were linguistic parrots . " He admits his interpreters have less language elegance because they must go right along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words on his part . But Dostert believes his system to be more reliable , since it does not depend on memory , but on agility . " Our opponents say that the mechanical business of earphones dehumanizes speeches , " he will argue , " but we have found that with head sets , you look at the speaker . They also say that simultaneous interpretation does not give delegates time to reflect ; but we say that delegates are sufficiently alert not to need such time . We do believe that about fifteen per cent of the time ? when an amendment , say , is being drawn that requires absolute accuracy ? consecutive translation is better . The interpreter can step down in that case from his booth and do a consecutive translation quite easily . " DOSTERT 's translators are younger than the consecutive interpreters and get paid less ; about $5,000 to $6,000 a year , as against about $8,000 for the older linguists . Using all five languages ,  | he requires twenty people for one team . He has found Chinese interpreters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far are non-existent . Nobody listens to the Chinese translations now , except occasionally a curious Chinese delegate ; but Dostert is looking forward to a time when delegates from China may be selected from a broader group than the present handful of American- or Britisheducated Chinese . Several of his interpreters were with him at Nuremberg , and he has also drawn on the language departments of American universities . Two of his youngest and best interpreters are a twenty-three-year-old Russian prince , Georges Vassilchikov , a dreamy-looking youth who has spent most of his life in France and England , and twenty-one-year-old Jeanne Streit , the daughter of Union Now 's Clarence Streit . Unlike the consecutive interpretation branch , which had a stable of internationally known interpreters to depend upon , Dostert is continually searching for qualified personnel . Only about ten per cent of those who apply are promising . Knowledge of languages is only the beginning . Interpreters must have intelligence , a broad culture , a good voice , and clear enunciation . He believes they operate best when they work as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreter translating Senator Connally from English into Russian was so completely wrapped up in his work that when Connally banged on the table the interpreter banged on his table , practically bursting the eardrums of his headset listeners . The Secretariat 's language experts also undertake a number of less public chores . In language research , they try to match words and phrases in the five official languages for the written record , so that their meanings will be exactly the same . Frequently this requires the invention of new words ; classical Chinese , for instance , has no words for many atomic doodads . An international glossary of new words and tricky phrases is in the works , to gather up language additions and clarifications as they are produced . They are also co-operating with the Personnel Division in the conducting of classes in the five official languages for Secretariat employees . Although it is hoped that eventually all personnel will be competent at least in both UN working languages , so far training has been after hours and voluntary . Nine hundred employees have enrolled for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , more than fifty per cent elected French , with 110 taking Russian , and twelve , Chinese . On call is a small battalion of translators who can handle not only the five official languages but practically every other tongue used today . They are prepared to translate any document from any language ? including Urdu and Pushtu . Some are also verbatim reporters , who sit at official meetings near the interpreters to take the speeches down in shorthand . Each language spoken at a meeting has its own verbatim reporter , who is relieved by a colleague so that he can leave the room to dictate his notes to a typist . He then returns to relieve his alternate , and the cycle continues until the speech is completed . Meanwhile the typist has cut the dictation on a mimeograph stencil , and five minutes later the newsmen begin to get their copies of the speech . If Gromyko , for example , begins to talk at 3:00 P.M. , the press begins to receive the speech , in sections , by 3:30 . A mimeographed verbatim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russian ? will be out by 6:00 that evening . The mimeographing of official speeches and committee reports ? the only form of mass printing done at Lake Success-is dropped in the overflowing lap of the  | three-shift Documents Division . During last fall 's General Assembly alone , the Documents Division clocked off 6,300,000 words , and it is proud of the fact that no meeting of the Assembly was held up for lack of necessary documents . This was accomplished only because everyone on the staff put in fifteen hours daily , seven days a week . ( Several of the division 's employees suffered nervous collapses . ) The Documents Division requires two hours to run off 2,000 copies of the average four- to five-page document , but it has turned out as many as 1,062 pages in twenty-four hours . III AS FAR BACK as last fall , while the General Assembly was still meeting , a small group of men at Lake Success in a second floor office marked " Conference Co-ordination " was already assigning space for UN 's meetings in 1947 . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference rooms , hours , days , and delegates as skillfully as the late W. C. Fields maneuvered a billiard cue ? their aim being , as a young Belgian statistician , Jean Taupin , expressed it , " to make absolutely sure that every international conference wo n't be held at the same time , on the same day , on the same morning , in the same room . " Taupin unexpectedly turned into a sleuth while he was making a study of the 1946 General Assembly . Oddly enough , he could find no master list of when and where each conference had been held . Any gathering , however small , is supposed to become an official meeting the minute its members issue an official document ; but one mysterious subcommittee of Committee Five was missing . It had issued a beautiful document , ' but where and when did it meet ? No one could remember . Taupin finally unearthed a man who recalled seeing four delegates from Committee Five huddled in a corner of a room after a meeting one day , with their hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only meeting the elusive subcommittee ever had . A classic joke around Lake Success , which especially tickled the efficiencyminded Conference Co-ordination people , was the fact that a Canadian proposal to cut down the time of the last Assembly was one of the concluding items on the Assembly 's agenda . " By the time the delegates got around to considering it , " Taupin chuckles , " there was nothing left to cut down . " PRoBABLY the most complicated Bob in the Secretariat is that of feeding the thousands of employees , delegates , and sightseers who spend the day ( and sometimes part of the night ) at Lake Success . The cafeteria , a vast cavern on the main floor which serves around 10,000 meals a day , never closes . The delegates ' restaurant , where the Secretariat personnel may also eat before 1:00 P.M. , is tucked away between a long string of administrative offices on the second floor ; it is open from 11:30 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. , or later if a morning meeting drags on past that hour : p 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most mass eating places , though possibly it seems less tasty because of the noise and poor ventilation . Nevertheless , each day 250 gallons of coffee and 400 gallons of milk , 1,500 pounds of meat , 1,200 pounds of green vegetables , and 1,250 pounds of potatoes are consumed . As many as sixty dozen bottles of yogurt have been eaten in a single day ; this unusual kind of milk product is a favorite with employees from the Balkans . Cafeteria eaters , no matter what country they hail from , seem to prefer American food . The British asked that Coca-Cola be sold , and the Russians put in a request for fresh fruit on the counters ? especially apples , tangerines , and bananas . Europeans frequently peer uncertainly at an unknown dish and ask for a listing of its contents . Inexplicably , French girls seem particularly confused by lamb stew . The Chinese used to ask for chow mein and chop suey , but after taking a look at the gummy mixture purveyed at the cafeteria they lost interest . Cafeteria employees find most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at mention of a certain French girl who never has mastered the basic principles of the place . She insists on going behind the counter to select her food , although she has been forcibly removed a dozen times by cafeteria workers and finally by UN guards . Once an Englishman lost a twelveyear-old pipe in the cafeteria , and had six members of his staff over and under tables for hours in search of it . Whole hams , bacon , eggs , and dried fruits are sold at a special counter , and the British delegate to the Assembly , Sir Hartley Shawcross , bought three hams there . He dropped around once a week to make sure the hams were still on ice . Then , in a fast sprint for his boat at the end of the Assembly , he left the hams on the dock . The cafeteria manager , Charles Williams , is still wondering who finally ate them . The delegates ' dining room is to the cafeteria as Antoine 's is to Nick 's Diner . Delegates and anyone else who can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cloths and attractive blue china , where they are served by quiet , efficient waitresses . The sense of being in an exclusive luncheon club i augmented by green plants at the win dows , attractive hangings against the nea beige walls , modernistic wooden chairs and slick brown linoleum . Only Senato Connally and Mrs. Roosevelt seem to have preferred the cafeteria atmosphere an ( diet . Gromyko is a steady customer of the dining room ; so was Bernard Baruch . According to Anne Corcoran , the din ing room 's pretty hostess , the average delegate eats his lunch on the run , rarer taking more than thirty minutes . She wa particularly gratified by the enthusiasn with which her guests attacked a buffe table , piled with great platters of lobster potato , . vegetable , and chicken salads cole slaw ; herring ; one hot dish ; all kind : of cheese ; and a great mound of frui ' which took Mrs. Corcoran an hour to build into a triumphant centerpiece European delegates said they had n't seer such food in five years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I try to have a European dislevery day , " Cavallo says , " but they like our food better . The Russians shun caviar I had sturgeon and caviar on the buffer table , think of it , and Gromyko 's secretary never even looked ! They go for turkey ham , and pork in a big way , and we never can give enough rice . I could have ter tons of rice , but still not enough ! " Gromyko , described as a " very quiet and pleasant customer , " is a fruit and tee fan . Contrary to expectations , the British ; drink quantities of coffee , but scarcely any tea . ( " Those awful bags ! " one Englishman remarked . ) THE big upset in the management 's calculations has occurred in the bars . There are three of these , located in the comfortable delegates ' lounge , with- its rust-and-beige overstuffed chain and soft green hangings , in the bare reaches of the press lounge , and in the " penthouse " Secretariat lounge atop the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of orange juice , which disappears at a rate of twenty to twenty-five gallons daily , and CocaCola , with forty to fifty cases consumed on an average day . " Them people never had orange juice  | and it seems they ca n't get enough of it , " the head bartender , Arthur Rice , is apt to say with a puzzled shake of his head . " And what do you think is our slowest seller ? Vodka ! We have n't sold three bottles of vodka since we opened . " The only time Gromyko came to the delegates ' bar , he asked for a glass of milk . The heaviest drinking , of course , is in the press bar . The English like their pink gins , and the French indulge in imported champagne and wines , especially with their meals . Cocktails are the most popular items ? next to orange juice and CocaCola ? with Martinis heading the list . Altogether , Rice figures , the bars at Lake Success use about thirty cases of hard liquor and fifteen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no drunks during business hours " ; he says , " to preserve peace , one must have a clear head and be on one 's toes . " But bartenders are disturbed by the careless way some delegates handle American money . The currency apparently confuses them , since they always pay with big bills . Restaurant employees are often startled by the way some of their customers dress . They are entranced with the fancy white robe and gold-and-white headdress of His Royal Highness Prince Feisal of Saudi Arabia , for example , and they were amazed to learn that turbans are not hats and therefore are not removed during meals . IV THE most thankless work in the Secretariat is that of the UN 's Security Division . Hidden in two small offices around the corner from the main entrance , it supervises the guards ; arranges credentials for delegates , the Secretariat , and the public ; and is in charge of fire protection , ushers , and escorts . It also is responsible for police enforcement , in which it has the co-operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , when such important officials as President Truman , Bevin , and Molotov are at Lake Success , it works with the White House Secret Service , Scotland Yard , and the NKVD . " It 's just a cop 's job on a high level , " is the way Security Chief Frank Begley describes his duties . " If it 's done well and strictly , you irritate somebody . You lose , even when you win . " Begley , a young looking , thoughtful man , who formerly worked with Connecticut 's State Police , has a staff of approximately a hundred men and women ; only fifty-four of these are guards . Begley ? easily one of the most popular officials at Lake Success ? is happiest when no one notices that the UN has a security section . He feels that in a world organization like the UN it must be assumed that the public is entitled to free access to meeting chambers and all UN areas ? until something happens to prove him wrong . So far , he does not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public and press suffered from too stringent security rules only in the opening days of the fall Assembly . This was due to the presence of President Truman , Molotov , and Bevin , who brought their own security officials with them . Although thousands of visitors attended the sessions , there were only two real disturbances during the Assembly , and both involved people who were removed so rapidly and quietly that few spectators were aware of what happened . One woman felt she could help Secretary Byrnes solve the veto problem if she could only speak to him personally . Refusing to send him a note , or get in touch with him through the U. S. delegation office at the Hotel Pennsylvania , she tried repeatedly to stop him in the halls . She finally stood up in the audience at a meeting . " May I speak ? " was as far as she got . Again , when Molotov was discussing world disarmament at the Political Committee meetings at Lake Success , a man suddenly rose from the seats set aside for spectators and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards assigned to Molotov , and out he went . Begley figures that in the normal course of events there will be one unpleasant incident a week . Religious fanatics , persons aroused by racial issues , psychopaths , and drunks who bring a bottle in their coat pocket are the chief nuisances . Women are much worse than men because they are  | more difficult to ease quietly off the premises . The usual method is to let them talk on the way to the fence line and then quickly close the gates behind them . Mostly , they try to sound off on their pet political theories in the lobbies , or to argue that the UN ca n't succeed without their special personal type of God . A number of persons have the mistaken impression that since the UN opened for business all laws are international . They demand that the UN aid them in problems of immigration , labor disputes , in obtaining a higher standard of living , or even in getting veterans ' rights when they can not obtain satisfaction through national channels . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office is the person bringing gifts to delegates . These are usually hand-worked personal items such as doilies or jewelry , or honor scrolls that the donor is anxious to award to someone he thinks will support his cause .  | These people are all referred to the individual delegation headquarters . Equally annoying are souvenir hunters who walk off with desk markers bearing the names of delegates ' countries , pen sets , memos or doodles delegates have made , or water glasses and pitchers certain delegates have used . So far , fifty delegates ' signs and about a hundred pens have disappeared . Minor crackpots as well as people on legitimate quests for knowledge are referred to the information desk . Someone recently called to ask who were the delegates from the Ukraine ; Poland , and New Jersey , and another caller wanted to speak to the man in charge of Long Island . A woman swathed in furs rushed in not long ago demanding assistance to drive off " Communists who are tearing up the trees on my front lawn , " and a builder putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of closets from the UN because he understood " you handle such matters . " Many people , confusing the UN with UNRRA or other relief agencies , have inquired about relatives in displaced persons ' camps or in workers ' camps in Russia . After 5:30 every afternoon , without fail , dozens of school children phone for scraps of UN information required for their homework . People are apt to feel a personal ownership in UN ; one man who called for information on some obscure document became impatient and said , " Do n't give me the runaround . I 'm the boss of these here United Nations ! " Many people come in person , demanding to see high UN officials , almost invariably asking for Mr. Lie , Mrs. Roosevelt , or Mr. Gromyko . Only the stubborn ones are turned over to Begley . One of the most unexpected queries , however , came to George Barnes , the exceptionally personable and able director of the UN 's press division . A fifteen-yearold boy named Henry Jarecki appeared in front of his desk one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he be accredited to the United Nations as a working newspaperman . He said he represented a magazine for teen-age boys run by a handful of youngsters in Queens . Barnes , with a vision of several hundred school kids swelling the ranks of the eight hundred adult correspondents already accredited , was momentarily taken aback when the boy blurted out : " Say , this organization is for the next generation , is n't it ? Well , I 'm the next generation ! We 're the men of tomorrow , see ? " Although Henry was not accredited he has come out several times to check on the way things are running . Writing later about his experiences in his magazine , Picture Story , he expressed the hope that " the country will be as well informed about the proceedings of the UN for the next two or three generations " as it is now , and suggested a floor show with the " incomparable Hildegarde " to keep the reporters on the job . That the world is kept well informed about UN is indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting staff . Even with hundreds of reporters from the daily press covering every facet of UN , the press division has sent out as much as 25,000 words a day to local bureaus of newspapers all over the earth . In addition it maintains a clip service for small newspapers in French , English , and Spanish , and sends out hourly releases on every meeting conducted at Lake Success . What distinguishes Barnes ' office from the traditional government information agency is that he and his reporters adhere to an absolutely open press policy , with emphasis on re- leasing as much news as possible rather than presenting a handout of carefully selected items . The strict objectivity with which the Secretariat 's press division handles UN news got a backhanded testimonial recently when a delegate refused to give them an advance copy of a speech , because he felt that the press division would handle it " too objectively . " V BETWEEN the employees of the Secretariat and their genial chief , Trygve Lie , there is a feeling of considerable affection . This is due in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which staff members help make decisions on such matters as cuts in pay , housing , bus schedules , appointments , and promotions . The idea came from employees with trade union backgrounds , and subsequently eleven members of the staff were elected by the various Secretariat departments to represent them on a staff committee . In January this gave way to a larger bargaining agency , the Association of the Staff of the UN . Staff members generally ? and the majority are tough realists ? regard Lie , an old trade union man himself in Norway , as a democratic and competent chief . There are plenty of beefs about administration , but Lie appears to inspire the same kind of loyalty among his staff that Franklin Roosevelt used to invoke among his colleagues . Although Lie is a master politician , rather than an administrator , he loathes inefficiency and has a violent temper when he feels his instructions are not being followed out . " It is like an earthquake , " one of his colleagues commented . " The doors bang and there is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven ! " Lie , who prefers to tell subordinates what he wants done and then leave them free to work it out in their own way , goes at a terrific pace himself . He is at his office by nine every morning , and though he leaves at six whenever possible , he usually takes work home with him . His one unbreakable rule is that no matter what state the world is in he must get eight hours ' sleep every night . The Secretary-General works in a large cool room with long windows and a soft green rug . A couch and comfortable chairs are grouped around an enormous desk . One wall is covered by a huge map of the world . The only other decorations are two pictures of the great Norwegian explorer , author , and statesman , Fridtjof Nansen . A small conference room is next to Lie 's office , gay with red leather chairs , where he meets with his assistant secretarygenerals at 9:30 every morning . Working for the UN Secretariat is regarded as more than just a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of UN in its pioneer days . Despite the fact that salaries are tax-free , it is not the type of work where advancement comes easily , or where huge sums of money can ever be made . More than half the twenty-seven hundred employees make less than $3,500 a year with some as low as $1,350 ; fewer than fifty make more than $10,000 . Rumblings of discontent over wages are frequently heard from the lower income groups and from employees supporting families abroad , in spite of cost-of-living increases and generous per diem allowances for employees trapped by high hotel expenses . Nevertheless , the demand for UN jobs is tremendous and world-wide . An average of one thousand applications a week for Secretariat jobs still come to Lake Success , in virtually every known language . The majority are from Americans , a large number veterans . Many applicants from France , Belgium , Norway , and the Netherlands are former members of the underground , who still cling to the wartime psychology of secrecy and refuse to tell what they did during the occupation . Frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names and whereabouts of relatives should be . " I am animated by a deep yearning for peace and adjustment between nations , " reads a typical letter written by a Polish woman . ( She was imprisoned by the Nazis and her family was murdered . ) " I would work for the UN , not with the mentality of a salaried employee , but with zeal and idealism . "  | The UN gets its share of eccentric applications . One woman , who listed her dependents as two white mice and a cat , sent in a photograph of herself in a black chemise , and several have enclosed pictures of themselves in bathing suits . A middle-aged lady describing herself as an ex-ballerina submitted a series of photographs in provocative dancing poses . Another listed her present job as " associate mother . " Several applicants claiming to be ex-opera stars have applied for language jobs . Astrologers have offered their services , and one man arrived in person with a United . Nations hymn of his own composition , which he sang in full voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sponsored by his government to be considered for a UN job . Many Balkan subjects apply on their own , and some have been hired ; but there have been no applications from Russia except those sponsored by the government . The Soviet Union is extremely reluctant to part with any of her trained people , in spite of repeated requests from UN personnel officials . Everyone agrees that the UN does not have the representation it should have from the Soviets , and departments have been known to leave a position vacant for as long as a year on the possibility of filling it with a colleague from Russia . Employees are frequently hired on the strength of their qualifications without any previous consultation with officials of their countries . Lie insisted on this vital principle from the beginning , and talked the member nations into agreeing to it . Every new employee must take an oath to regulate his conduct " with the interests of the United Nations only in view . " He must further pledge himself " not to seek or accept instructions in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any authority external to the United Nations organization . " Officials admit that some employees do not yet have an entirely international outlook ; their feelings may range from general sympathy for their own country to direct use of UN facilities to further their own national interests . Those who come from government service are especially hard to wean from such nationalistic impulses . UN officials hope , however , that acceptance of the basic idea that the UN employee owes his primary loyalty to the United Nations will grow over the years , as nations and people gain confidence in the UN as an agency for keeping world peace . For this principle of loyalty first to the world , and second to one 's country , is the keystone of the entire United Nations organization . Unless it is accepted not only by the UN Secretariat but by the UN delegates , and their home governments ? unless it finds favor in the hearts of men everywhere ? no amount of efficient housekeeping can save the United Nations from the same slow , fatal paralysis that struck the League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
