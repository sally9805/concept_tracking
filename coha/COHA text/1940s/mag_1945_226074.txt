The U.S. would trust in God , and keep its plutonium dry . With patience and firmness it would help to build a world of order . The Russians , who had neither God nor ( as yet ) plutonium , would have to trust the peace-loving U.S. <P> Every Life , Everywhere . President Truman , restating U.S. foreign policy ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , spoke directly to Americans who have freedom and want a secure peace . Indirectly , he also spoke to Britain , wartime ally and uneasy peacetime junior partner ; to lesser allies who look to the U.S. for leadership ; to people everywhere who want freedom ; and to the Russians . <P> U.S. foreign policy touched every life in every country . Yet the political power world turned around the Big Two . Just as Russian foreign policy was judged largely by its effect on the U.S. , so any statement of U.S. policy would be judged by its effect on Russia . The question was not whether the Russians would like Truman 's policy , but whether they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubly distrustful of generalities , would try to apply Truman 's words to specific problems and places . <P> Only in the Balkans ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) would they have much success in judging the words by the realities . There , the reiterated refusal of the U.S. to recognize " any government imposed upon any nation by the force of any foreign power " was all too clear to the Russians . Elsewhere , in focal Germany , in restive Asia , words and numbered paragraphs which seemed explicit enough to Americans at home would seem vaguely general to the Russians , Britons , Chinese , et al . trying to evaluate them , and to the U.S. officials charged with applying them . Still needed were clear directives , clearly integrated actions to make the policy intelligible at the point where it must work . <P> Similarity of Opposites . In some vital respects the Truman policy and Russian policy were curiously alike . <P> Truman said the U.S. needed the world 's greatest military might in order to : 1 ) enforce the peace on Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) defend the Western Hemisphere , and 4 ) defend the U.S. By substituting " countries bordering the U.S.S.R. " for " Western Hemisphere , " the Russians could state their policy in the same terms . <P> From the viewpoint of lesser nations who had to put their whole trust in collective security , the Big Two were dangerous not because their foreign policies were so different , but because they were so much alike . And they were alike because each of the Big Two , atomic bomb or no , trusted more in its own ability to defend itself than in collective action .
