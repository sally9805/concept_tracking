F YOU want to become unpopular with the National Broadcasting Company , just mention the name of Dr. Louis I. Berg . Doctor Berg has the same effect on radio executives as Franklin D. Roosevelt has on Colonel McCormick . A noted New York psychiatrist , Doctor Berg is the foremost enemy of the daytime radio serial , financial backbone of the broadcasting industry . On March 6 , 1942 , Doctor Berg , at his own expense , issued a pamphlet entitled : Preliminary Report : A Study of Certain Radio Programs and Their Effects Upon the Audience , Especially Adolescents and Women at the Clirnacterium . In this report , Doctor Berg stated that if the average woman were to listen steadily to such programs as The Woman in White or The Right to Happiness , there would ensue a breakdown in her nervous system . In a second report , Doctor Berg asserted that besides psychopathia sexualis the radio serials offered to their estimated audience of 20,000,000 housewives a parade of adultery , insanity , suicide and " rankling hatred . " " Truly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional sewers , drained the emotional swamps for much of their material . " The psychiatrist listened to forty episodes apiece of ten serials , including Young Dr. Malone , Joyce Jordan , The Guiding Light and Stella Dallas . He took notes on his pulse beats and blood pressure before and after listening to each episode . The serials did his pulse and blood pressure no good . What will happen to a woman if she listens to serials all the time , says Doctor Berg . is that she will experience increased blood pressure , nocturnal frights , vasomotor instability , vertigo , gastrointestinal disturbances , not to speak of profuse perspiration , tremors and a alight touch of tachycardia . " It all adds up to a very pretty fatigue syndrome , " Doctor Berg tells people . Among the constituents of a fatigue syndrome are malaise , insomnia , inability to concentrate , emotional instability , depression and all sorts of phobias . Curiously enough , despite the baleful syndromes supposedly produced by episodes of Joyce Jordan or Amanda of Honeymoon Hill , the ladies like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they continue to buy the approximately twenty brands of soap advertised on these soap operas  --  culled soap operas because they are largely sponsored by soap manufacturers . When a complimentary pie plate or dishcloth is offered  --  in return for a box top  --  the ladies will mail in prodigious quantities of box tops . General Mills , who sponsor Betty and Bob , once announced a contest for the best name for a baby born on the program and were deluged with 3,000.000 entries . Even without the inducements of prizes and premiums , the female listeners write in thousands of letters every week , advising Portia how to face Life , or telling Carolyn Kramer , heroine of The Right to Happiness , to beware of a Mrs. Campbell . " I guess it 's just that we women are the tougher sex , " proudly explains Mrs. Thomas Burke , of Staten Island . New York , a rather typical daytime-serial fan . Mrs. Burke affirms that she has been listening to from PHOTOGRAPHY BY JACK MANNING seven to ten radio serials every day for eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tachycardias or nocturnal frights . " Of course , I was a little worried last year when Carolyn Kramer was being tried for killing her husband . But , you see , we women can take things like that in our stride . You just try running a house and managing two children , and you 'll see that all the troubles in these stories will seem tame by comparison . Furthermore , a woman just naturally likes to chat about troubles in general . A man ca n't see that point of view . You get a hen party together , and what 'll they talk about ? Operations and somebody having trouble with their mother-in-law . We women just enjoy talking about misery . " Mrs. Burke lives with her husband , a time engineer , and her two children , Thomas , Jr. , eight , and Kathleen , three , in a tidy little six-room house . She has no maids to help out . She keeps the house , prepares the meals and supervises the children . And she does it all to the tune of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribulations of Mary Marlin or the desperate situations in which Mrs. Goldberg is always getting herself involved , Mrs. Burke believes that the radio serial is the greatest boon to womankind since the invention of the vacuum cleaner . " I do n't know what I 'd do without these stories , " ahe says . " They make the time pass so pleasantly , you just forget you 're all alone in the house . " Mrs. Burke starts the day by making the beds while listening to The O'Neills . She dusts and straightens out the living room to Amanda of Honeymoon Hill and Road of Life . She prepares lunch for the children while hearing Vic and Sade . She washes and irons to Mary Marlin and The Right to Happiness . The only thing she is unhappy about is that she ca n't follow Portia Faces Life and When a Girl Marries , which are on from 5:00 to 5:30 and are in opposition to Hop Harrigan and The Sea Hound , the two favorite programs of Tommy , Jr . Mrs. Burke , a brisk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to pieces . When Doctor Berg 's arguments were mentioned , she chuckled . " Those prolessoral " she said tolerantly . " They never had a cranky baby to manage or the washing to do . " Almost from its very beginnings in 1930 , the fivetimes-a-week , fifteen-minutes-a-day serial has been the target of educators , literary critics , women 's clubs and psychiatrists ; the obstinate Doctor Berg recently having issued his third blast on the subject . In 1940 , the General Federation of Women 's Clubs started an I 'm Not Listening campaign . Their members were supposed to mail in millions of postal cards to the networks threatening that if the " hysterical " cliff hangers were not taken off the air , they would cease to listen to the radio . They asked for educational programs , symphony music and book reviews . The campaign petered out in a few months . Storrs Haynes , the radio director of the Compton Advertising Agency , which produces many of the serials , says , " What the critics of daytime serials do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entertainment and women just do n't want them . We 've had shows like Doctor Defoe giving hints on raising children , Beatrice Fairfax with advice to the lovelorn , book reviewers , astrologers , George Rector with kitchen suggestions , but the best these shows can do is an average one or two Crossley . whereas at leastfifteen of the serials have an eight or better Crossley rating . " A Crossley is the batting average of a radio program , based on a survey of telephone calls made at random ; so that if , let us say , a program has a Crossley of nine , it means that 9 per cent of the radio sets in operation were tuned to that program . Gilbert Ralston , in charge of radio aerials for Procter &; Gamble , who spend more on radio time and talent than any other company , and who currently sponsor fourteen serials in English and five in Polish , Italian and French , says , " Doctor Berg personally may prefer Shakespeare to The Right to Happiness , but millions of women like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another person 's entertainment ? It 's just a hunk of democracy at work . And it is n't all heart throbs and melodrama , either , although I ca n't see anything wrong with melodrama , and there i s plenty of gore in Macbeth or King Lear . But we giveour audiences comedy shows like Vic and Sade or clever characterization and amusing dialogue as in Snow Village , and I say both of these shows are pretty literate and could stack up along with the average A motion picture or a Book-of-the-Month Club selection . It 's an infuriating injustice the way these highbrows are always jumping on the aerials . Most of them jump to hasty conclusions after hearing two or three episodes , or maybe they decide to become experts and they sit by their radios for one solid day and just listen to twenty serials in succession . Try listening to twenty episodes from Shakespeare in a row and see if you do n't get a bad case of vasomotor instability yourself . And our villains do n't tear out poor old men 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soap opera is solidly entrenched in radio . One third of the total revenue comes from the approximately $25,000,009 , annually spent by serial sponsors . About two thirds of the daylight time on Columbia and NBC is absorbed by the forty-four washboard weepers . No other art form since Homer smote his bloomin ' lyre and began telling continued stories has ever appealed to so vast an audience so continuously . And it is an audience which stands in a peculiar relationship to the narrative . There is no air of make-believe about the serials . The episodes are presented as " true-life stories . " The announcer on The O'Neills will begin , " Good morning , friends of the O'Neills , a family we know as well as our own . The O'Neills believe that charity should begin at home , but not end there . And now let 's visit a while with Mother O'Neill . " Neither the actors nor the writers are given credit , to heighten the naturalism . Unlike the films , in which the fictional role is usually lost in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the radio serials the actor is anonymous  --  completely submerged in the part he is playing . And the fans respond to the serials on the real-life level . The fictional characters are always receiving letters like this one sent to the heroine of When a Girl Marries : " Dear Joan Davis : How are you feeling ' ? I have been waiting every day for you to get the baby . Was I glad when heard the baby cry ! When the doctor said your heart was weak , I cried all night . Oh , please do n't let anything happen to you . I hope you name the baby Harry , Jr. , or , if it is a girl , name it after you . " Recently , Portia Blake , of Portia Faces Life , had been brooding because she thought her fianc ? , Walter Manning , was killed in North Africa ; all the other characters in the story knew Walter was alive , but for some reason they neglected to tell Portia . Finally , a listener in Gulfport , Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portia , " she wrote , " as a listener to your radio program and a good friend , I feel it is my duty to tell you something of the utmost importance . I feel very sorry for you . But , my dear girl , I want you to prepare yourself for a shock . You 'd better sit down . Walter Manning is not dead . It grieves me greatly that not one of your friends have told you before now . Please do not tell anyone I told you this , because I believe they would he mad at me . But please do n't cry any more . Walter is coming back to you . " Last year , 100 women in South Dakota signed a round robin and sent it to Young Doctor Malone , c/o CBS , protesting they would atop buying Poet 's 40 per cent Bran Flakes unless Doctor Malone went back to his " lovely wife . " They added , " Doctor Malone , you are certainly setting a horrid example to our husbands . " When Doctor and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding presents , including expensive cut-glass decanters and sterling-silver bowls , were sent by well-wishers all over the country to the newlyweds , c/o CBS . Devious , indeed , are the elements of a serial . There must be , fundamentally , a heroine who suffers . Carolyn Kramer , of The Right to Happiness , for example , during four short years has fallen in love with a man years older than herself . Although she was " little more than a schoolgirl , " and although the man was engaged to her widowed mother , Carolyn married Bill . A few months later she fell in love with a Dwight Kramer , divorced Bill , married Kramer , who was killed in an accident , was put on trial for his murder , had her baby in jail , was acquitted of the murder , fell in love with one of the jurors , a Dr. Richard Campbell , went to work for his brother , Charles Campbell , and at the present time is beginning to fall in love with Charles Campbell and has aroused the jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroine , there is usually the benign matron who gives everybody advice and straightens out problems . When a new problem appears on the serial , it follows a definite curve . It takes about five weeks for the problem to work itself out , and before it is com-pletely resolved , a new tribulation turns up . Ma Perkins and Mother O'Neill are two problem straighteners . Sometimes the problem straightener is herself in-volved in much suffering  --  as in the case of Mrs. Goldberg , who is always getting into trouble because of her tendency to meddle in other people 's business . Usu-ally , the heroines experience several lacerations at once . Stella Dallas , for instance , has been upset because her only daughter has run away and nothing has been heard of her for months ; as if this were not enough , Stella has simultaneously been accused of stealing a missing ruby ring from her employer . The male animal is not portrayed in flattering tunes in the average serial . Normally , the men are just putty in the hands of designing women ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a week and do not grasp the deeper meanings of life , and are always falling for a pretty secretary . Incidentally , when the women are not having " second husbands , " the men are having " other wives . " A man , on these serials , can always be talked into doing anything by a sufficiently persuasive woman , and the heroines of the serials are always persuasive . Of course , it ends up with the heroine seething in a new whirlpool of grief , and you would think some of the heroines would put themselves in the hands of their menfolk for a change . but they never do . In the radio serial the emphasis is often on the medical  --  the writers having tapped that eternal gold mine of women 's predilection for Lingering over the details of operations . Few serials can progress very long without having an episode take place either in a sanatorium , hospital , insane asylum , laboratory or sickbed . The characters experience every sort of diseese , including amnesia , blindness , heart murmur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential . His quivering arpeggios set the mood , and he gives out with ominous chords that bridge the action from one hectic scene to another . Very few sound effects are heard on the serials  --  they are mostly talk  --  but doors opening and closing are frequently employed , and the sound-effects man on a serial is known to his confreres as a " door stammer. - The announcer tends to be something of a philosopher and will open the episode with a sage aphorism cribbed from a book of quotations , such as " Happiness is property . It is the noblest of all possessions , " or , " No matter what your hope . never can you find happiness so completely as by bringing joy into the lives of others . " On Life Can Be Beautiful , which is known in the profession by its initials as Elsie Beebe , the quotations are chosen with much care and are called Elsie Beebegrams . CBS has discovered that many women enjoy the Elsie Beebe-grams as much as they do the story itself , and some listeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He receives a half dozen letters a month complimenting him on the philosophical tranquillity he has achieved . No Patchwork After the opening chords of the organ and the aphorism comes the " leed-in " ? spoken in tense voice against a quivering organ chord ; " And now , The Right to Happiness . ( Pause . Behind a white and silent door on the top floor of a large Chicago hospital , the fate of Malcolm , the twelve-year-old son of Charles and Barbara Campbell , is being determined . " The episode is always concluded with the " teaser " or " come-along , " such as this one from Bachelor 's Children , which involves a lady who has been tricked into a false marriage and finds herself about to become the mother of an illegitimate babe : " And what Ike ahead for this unwanted baby ? Listen to tomorrow 's episode of Bachelor 's Children and hear the surprising opinion of the doctor . " Although the highbrow enemies of the serial contend it is a hastily sewn patchwork of pathological emotions , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually interpreted by noted stage stars , who lounge all day on the third floor of the NBC , waiting for bits on the radio serials . The creator of Doctor Berg 's bete noire . The Right to Happiness , is no leering ogre . He is James M. Young , is thirty-six-year-old former advertising copywriter from Williamsport , Pennsylvania . Mr. Young is a quiet , timid man , tidily plump , with uneasy blue eyes peeping from shell-rimmed eyeglasses . He lives in Cearsdale , New York , with his wife and two children , but does not do his writing at home . He sublets a small office in a suite of miscellaneous offices at 516 Fifth Avenue , and here he appears six days a week promptly at 9:30 A.M. , bearing a thin briefcase , and types dialogue until 5:30 . He has his lunch , consisting of a chicken sandwich and milk , always sent up . Mr. Young 's ceaseless and mysterious typing troubles the other occupants of the suite , and the general theory seems to be that he is writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to do just one episode  --  about 2000 words  --  and his annual output is about 500,000 words  --  enough for three novels . In December of every year , Mr. Young gets up a thirteen-page general outline that takes the serial through the following twelve months . " Actually , " he says , " you have to think further ahead ; I know what my characters are going to do in 1945 . " The compact outline is then gradually expanded into a longer monthly outline , and thee in turn , is developed into a more detailed weekly outline . After Mr. Young completes five scripts , he sends them on to Corlis Wilber , young and pretty script supervisor at the Compton Agency , and after she makes the textual corrections and sound-effects directions , the episodes are sent to Mr. Ralston , the sponsor 's watchbird , for further emendations . Rehearsals are held every day . Monday through Friday , and the episode is rehearsed the same day as it is broadcast in Studio 3G at NBC in Rockefeller Plaza . Around 2:15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claudia Morgan and Selena Royle , starts drifting into the studio . Tall , shambling , tweedy Axel Gruenberg , the director , hands out copies of today 's episode to the cast . They sit around a small table and everybody reads the script under his breath and underlines his own part . By 2:30 they are ready for the first line reading . " You must have flown out from the office , dear , " begins Doris Mintern , the mother of Carolyn . who is played by Selena Royle . Director Gruenberg , a veteran of domestic discord , with such shows as Against the Storm , Mary Marlin and Girl Alone to his credit , sits quietly by , smokes a pipe and listens to the actors giving their own interpretations to the lines . The line reading takes about fourteen minutes , and before it is over the sound-effects man has padded in and helped himself to a script . There is only one sound effect in this episode  --  the slam of a door  --  and after noting this , the door stammer wheeLs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to any walls . The atmosphere of the rehearsal is quiet and casual ; only the crackling of pages being turned is heard . The second line reading begins . " You must have flown out from the office , dear , " repeats Miss Royle . This time Gruenberg is not happy about the way Fred Mintern is handling his opening speeches . " Try it again , Fred , " he says quietly , " and he a tittle more breathless . Bite into those lines more . Give us more excitement . " " You must have flown out from the office , dear , " says Miss Royle patiently . The announcer , a sophisticated young man , arrives and looks at the script . " Good Lord , " he says , " are they still in that accident business ? I thought they 'd have that finished yesterday . " The fifth time the actors speak their lines around the mike , and Gruenberg has gone into the control room to hear how it will sound to the audience . He watches the actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mike in the control room ; this cuts off the flow of sound from the studio and enables him to talk to the actors . The control-board engineer arrives and begins to plug in the wires that will make the proper network connections . A censor from NBC named Art Hanna arrives and looks over the script to make certain that it is clean . The organist who will play the bridges is Bill Meeder , one of the best organists for serials in the business . Meeder will play the transition music by remote control . He does the Pepper Young 's Family program at 3:30 and he has n't time to race into Studio 3G . He has a pair of earphones clapped to his head on the eighth floor of NBC , and he hears the actors speaking and inserts the proper organ passages . Promptly at 3:45 , Eastern War Time , Director Gruenberg signals the announcer , who gives the commercial and then the lead-in . Then Gruenberg shoots an index finger out to the waiting Miss Royle . One-Man Crusade " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Miss Royle to millions of American housewives and Doctor Berg , who is now gathering data for a fourth pamphlet . Doctor Berg sits in his office on East Sixty-eighth Street and listens to serials every day . He denies that there are any mysterious forces behind his crusade . " There is nobody behind Louis Berg but Louis Berg , " he says . " It 's a personal mission . And it has cost me about four thousand dollars in time and in the expense of printing those pamphlets . But I feel that , as a physician , I would be derelict in my duty to the community if I did not fight this thing . It 's like contaminated milk . If a doctor discovered a source of contaminated milk he would be honor bound to make it a public issue . I 've had nothing from my crusade but headaches and attacks from the radio industry . " Many of Doctor Berg 's patients are women in their forties , who are experiencing the change of life . " If a woman is predisposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time of her life that her guard is down , she has decreased mental resistance , and she is liable to what we call menopausal depression . " It takes about eight months to correct a case of menopausal depression , and a woman in a highly neurotic state may be upset , says Doctor Berg , by any mental factor in her environment , by a certain type of movie or a highly wrought emotional novel . In 1941 , Doctor Berg was treating a woman who would experience an upcurve for several weeks and then , mysteriously , she would suffer a relapse . Doctor Berg carefully questioned the woman , but could find nothing to account for the frequent relapses , until she confessed one afternoon that sometimes , when she was sitting around the house with nothing to do . she would turn on the radio , and then she would start worrying about the troubles of the characters . " I put her on a steady diet of Fred Allen and Jack Benny , and she showed an immediate improvement , " remarked Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Berg began to listen to them regularly and take notes on the plot situations , and then had his assistant measure his pulse and blood pressure . " The serials just reek with twisted and morbid suggestions , " he insists . " They deal with the dark alleys of human corruption . They appeal to the lowest instincts . " But the writers of the serials laugh off this indictment , " If we have any formula et all , " Frank Hummert says , " it 's simply that wo show the success stories of unsuccessful people . " There is plenty of gold lurking in the emotional suds of the soap opera . Mrs. Gertrude Berg , a plump pleasant woman with a flair for seeing the homely details of everyday life , makes $2000 a week writing , acting and directing The Gold bergs. ' ma Phillips , a former Chicago schoolteacher and a genius at throbbing a heart , is good for an annual gross of around $250,000 . Her first serial , Painted Dreams , premiered in 1931 and is still going strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Road of Life as well . Miss Phillips says the main thing is to write simply . " One of my limitations is my greatest asset , " she claims . " I have a very small vocabulary . " The most fabulous figures in the industry are the Hummerts , Frank and Anne , who are vice-presidents of the BleckettSample-Hummert Agency . The Hummerts produce eleven soap operas and account for a grand total of 6,000,000 heated words every year . They no longer create this prodigious wordage themselves . The Hummerts have developed a literary belt line , which operates at their lovely colonial-style house in Greenwich , Connecticut . Like Alexandre Dumas , who employed sixty assistants to help him write his 277 books , the Hummerts have twenty hired hands . Mr. and Mrs. Hammen provide the general story outline , and then various members of their crew fill in one or another detail of the serial as each episode rolls down the verbal assembly line . The Hummerts are responsible for Second Husband , Backstage Wife , Stella Dallas , David Harum , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the spawning ground of the daytime serial , in the early 1930 's . Chicago was compelled to develop dramatic forms for radio , because , while it was a hustling metropolis with many stations , most of the musical talent and the famous actors were concentrated in New York and Hollywood . The progenitor of the serial was The Smith Family , broadcast over WENR in 1925 , and written by a small-time vaudeville team , Jim and Marian Jordan . The Jordans were ahead of their time , and The Smith Family was dropped after a few months . Today , the Jordan are doing pretty well in radio as Fibber McGee and Molly . In 1930 , Amos ' n ' Andy skyrocketed to popularity by using the fifteen-minute daily-serial pattern , and a year later , Frank Hummert , a Chicago publicity man , adapted the pattern to its present ritual of double , double , toil and trouble , when he originated Just Plain Bill . Bill was a small-town barber with a mortgage hanging over his barbershop . He appeared at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical way Bill demonstrated that you could find happiness by " livin ' your own life the right way , " even if you were in a financial mess . Since 1931 , Bill has stoically gone from one suffering to another , and he is still one of the favorite characters in daytime radio . As one sociologist puts it : " The serial was born with the depression . It was a marvelous success because it furnished just what the nation demanded : the rationalization of national frustration . " This observer , Dr. Matthew N. Chappell , a consultant to Hooper , Inc. , a firm which gets out surveys of radio-program popularity , believes that today the serial must snap out of its gloomy mood and give us a more activating stimulus . " Because now , " Doctor Chappell maintains , " we have been shaken out of our psychological hog wallow by the brutal designs of the Axis . As a result , the daytime serial is distinctly out of rapport with the present national mental set . " Mrs. Burke , however , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , with all their weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth . When it comes to a choice between Doctor Chappell and Mrs. Burke , the sponsors are putting their money on milady . After all , it is she , and not the professors , who are interested in getting clothes whiter , hands smoother and dishes cleaner .
