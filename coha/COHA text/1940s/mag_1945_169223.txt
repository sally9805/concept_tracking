When the Americans marched into Monschau on the German-Belgian frontier last September , pretty Maria , a 17-year-old German , watched them in stony silence . But she confided her feelings to her lover , Peter , an SS man , in letters which she could not mail to unoccupied Germany . The letters were discovered when Maria was arrested last week for talking to a would-be Nazi saboteur . <P> " I feel it clearly , " wrote Maria , " that we , the youth , are a sorely tried , but also a steeled youth and as hard as iron , destined to fight on for the ideal of our indispensable Fhrer . When everybody deserts the Leader , he will be able to depend on his real youth . They will never betray him . . . . <P> " Besides all our other troubles , we have to have these Americans in the street . These pigs are afraid of us . . . . I hate the Americans . One thing they can not take away from us . We will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught : to live means to fight . . . . I wish the new secret weapon would appear . The flames are licking up to the Rhine . My Cologne , Peter ! Is n't there any justice any more to make these culprits pay ? <P> " The American is altogether a comical soldier . He stands guard with an umbrella . . . . The American comes and then he gets no farther . . . . They are not soldiers-jitterbugs and tango lovers-'fight ' and ' advance ' are foreign words to them . . . . " <P> As an afterthought she added : " Today I just about rushed into a buried mine . An American saved my life . "
