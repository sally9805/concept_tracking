No journalist , no OCD coordinator , but a youth right out of college and training for an Army Air Corps commission wrote the week 's most penetrating comment on morale . Published in the Sioux Falls Argus-Leader was a letter written back home by handsome young Flyer Jerald B. Davis , 24 : <P> " In not too many weeks I 'm to be an Army officer . But when I 'm honest with myself I confess that throughout my training I 've had in mind becoming an instructor , not because I thought I would be especially good as an instructor , but because I thought that would be the safest job I could find in my business . <P> " There , it seems to me , is the essence of the whole trouble . We are an entire nation of people who are trying to wage a war and everyone is trying , himself , to keep out of the hot seat . . . . <P> " Patriotism is surely something more than knowing verbatim the Pledge of Allegiance . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jap planes are about to bomb San Francisco and you feel that if you could just get a plane you 'd go up and give those yellow devils a taste of their own medicine . . . . <P> " It 's that kind of a feeling that has about decided me to apply for active service when the time comes . . . . If I get killed-well , what the hell ? We all die sometime , and very few of us get to die for a cause . And if I do get through I will have had a world of experience and the feeling that perhaps in times that try men 's souls I had stood the test . . . . "
