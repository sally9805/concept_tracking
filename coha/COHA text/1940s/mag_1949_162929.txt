When he enlisted in the Navy , Clark Council Hamilton , a fair-skinned , brown-eyed young fellow , listed himself as a white man . Last year , after he got out of the service , he went to Roanoke , Va. , married a redheaded , 19-year-old white girl named Florence Hammond , whom he had met while she was selling popcorn at a local movie house . Florence 's family were semiliterate Virginia dirt farmers . At first they welcomed Clark . But after a while his mother-in-law began to resent him-she still wanted Florence tied to her apron strings . <P> The young couple went off to Baltimore , got jobs and settled down . But the bride 's mother began badgering the girl over the telephone . Finally she told her daughter a baleful tale : she had dreamed that Hamilton was a Negro and then she had gone to Russellville , Ala. , found the boy 's mother and verified her suspicions . <P> Hamilton insisted that he was white and that he had been born in California rather than Russellville ( where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been born in 1928 ) . His wife believed him , refused to listen to her mother 's demands that she get a divorce . But her mother had a final weapon-she swore to a complaint against Hamilton . <P> He was arrested just before Christmas . He waived extradition , went back to Roanoke , was lodged in the white section of the segregated jail . <P> His wife got him a lawyer , swore that she still wanted him-black or white . But if he were proved to be a Negro ( Virginia 's definition : " every person in whom there is ascertainable any Negro blood " ) , he would be guilty of miscegenation-a crime punishable by as much as five years in the penitentiary.
