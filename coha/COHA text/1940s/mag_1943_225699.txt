Of a night during the London blitz , Anglo-Irish Poet Louis MacNeice once wrote in Common Sense : <P> " For the raid of May loth ... I had a seat in the stalls , having arranged to spend that night on St. Paul 's Cathedral . St. Paul 's has already had two direct hits , but Wren 's structure is standing up to it amazingly well ( if you go back stage in the cathedral you notice with what extraordinary ingenuity and thoroughness-and solidity-the whole thing is put together ) . ... It was a night of a full moon which half the time was lost in fire clouds , and from midnight till dawn H.E . bombs and incendiaries fell all over the City . ... In a little time great tawny clouds of smoke , rolling in a sumptuous Baroque exuberance , had hidden the river completely and there we were on the dome , a Classical island in a more than Romantic Inferno . It was far and away the most astonishing spectacle I have ever seen . . . . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , the U.S. had a good reason to remember the assault on Britain . The Bombed Buildings of Britain , a handsome record of destruction , was available in book form for U.S. readers ( Oxford ; $4.50 ) . The Bombed Buildings contains 270 photographs of 196 damaged buildings , and small-size , 18th and 19th-Century prints showing most of the structures in their former states . <P> Many of these charred , strewn , gaping images , signed by such names as Wren , Adam , Nash , Soane and Stuart , make a moving reaffirmation of their dignity and style . Ruin sometimes adds beauty as well as pathos . Says Architectural Writer J. M. Richards in an eloquent preface : " The architecture of destruction not only possesses an aesthetic peculiar to itself , it contrives its effects out of its own range of raw materials . Among the most familiar are the scarified surface of blasted walls , the chalky substance of calcined masonry , the surprising sagging contours of once rigid girders and the clear siena colouring of burnt-out brick buildings , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the City . " <P> Among the London buildings pictured : <P> &gt; St. Paul 's Cathedral , twice hit-once in the choir , once in the north transept . One photograph shows the yawning hole in the transept floor , a huge puncture made not by the bomb itself but by the weight of wreckage which fell after it . <P> &gt; The Church of St. Mary-le-Bow , whose delicate spire still stands , though the body of the church was wrecked by a direct hit . <P> &gt; The Church of St. Stephen 's , Walbrook , whose " columns , arches , spandrils and dome follow each other with the logic of a Euclidian theorem . " Wren 's great transept is buried in wreckage , and there is a jagged rip in the resetted dome . <P> &gt; The Palace of Westminster , bearer of Big Ben . The Commons chamber , burnt out , is shown gutted and writhing , its floor heaving under twisted steel . <P> &gt; Some anonymous buildings , suggesting another paragraph by Poet MacNeice : " And it is heartbreaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End which may not lately have been bombed but which were more or less evacuated under an earl ier terror and left to the rats and the damp - the petrification of the memory of poverty . Street after street of empty stinking homes which will never-or so we hope-be anybody 's homes any more . "
