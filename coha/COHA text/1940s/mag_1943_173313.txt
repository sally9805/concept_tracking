Day after the ashes of Speaker Edward Algernon Fitzroy ( TIME , March 15 ) were ceremoniously buried in the chancel of Westminster 's blitzed St. Margaret 's Church , The House of Commons assembled to " elect " his successor . Actually , the new Speaker had already been selected by the majority Conservative Party , approved by Laborites ; it only remained for the House to play through a venerable mumbo jumbo . <P> The clerk , bewigged and begowned Sir Gilbert Campion , rose and pointed silently at National Liberal George Lambert , M.P . since 1891 . Lambert then proposed Colonel the Rt . Hon. Douglas Clifton Brown , an Old Etonian , veteran of the First Dragoon Guards and the Northumberland Hussar Yeomanry , and Deputy Speaker since 1938 . Smart aleck Captain Alec Stratford Cunningham-Reid , a maverick Conservative who is regarded as a noisy nuisance by his own party , maladroitly interrupted the proceedings : he said that he did not object to Brown personally , but did object to his being thrust on the House by the Conservatives . Loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shame " greeted his protest ; and Laborite Will Thorne , the House 's oldest member ( 86 ) , blew two blasts on a football referee 's whistle to express his disapproval even more loudly . When order was restored , Brown accepted : " . . . I will give to you my very level best and thereto I pledge my word . " <P> Proposer Lambert and Laborite John Tinker , who had seconded the nomination , then advanced purposefully on Brown , to drag him from his seat . As Brown made the requisite gesture of protest , the two men seized his arms , separated him from his chair . ( Origin of this tradition : during the 15th Century , Speakers were apt to be hanged by the King , so a new Speaker was understandably reluctant . ) <P> King and Lords accepted him , the doorkeeper of the Commons announced : " Speaker elected . " Brown entered the Speaker 's House , donned his full-bottomed wig and the Speaker 's traditional large black gown . Then the Sergeant at Arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , marched Brown to the Chair of the House . Brown sat down : he was Britain 's 139th Speaker of the Commons .
