txt A building boom comparable to the peak construction years following the First World War was seen as definitely in the making for Massachusetts today , as the State ' Department of Labor and Industries thumbed over records of applications for more than 850,000 , - 000 worth of construction filed in the first four months of 1946 . In terms of actual expenditures contemplated by would-be homeowners , applications have been made for $13,485,976 in new housekeeping units , and 8230,800 in nonhousekeeping units , presumably apartment house accommodations . This count is in the nature of a landslide , as compared with the meager total of $444,836 applied , for in the first four months of 1945 , the Department stated .

Evidence of the work of Federal agencies in the State was apparent in the fact that 1,174 of the contemplated 3,556 new family accommodations would be created through alterations and convex- sions of large buildings , or barns and garages into actual dwelling units . For all types of construction , including commercial buildings , alterations and repairs on both housing and business properties , applications amounting to $54,000,000 for the first four months dwarf the corresponding figure of $6,500,000 in 1945 . This contemplated work is scattered in small quantities from the big cities down to the small towns . Thus , the over-all construction program , if maintained at present application levels throUghout the year , will build up to more than $150,000,000 worth of building , which is close to the building perimeters of the boom years following World War I.
