Across the green leather benches and jarrah parquet floors of Canberra 's House of Representatives the honorable members shouted and carried on like aborigines at a corroboree . Through three acrimonious days the Labor Government and the Opposition called each other names , including traitor . Then , after beating a no-confidence motion by one vote , Prime Minister John Curtin decided to take the issue to the country . A general election was slated for August . <P> The issue was strictly domestic politics . Dyspeptic John Curtin had angered the Opposition by declaring publicly that the Jap invasion threat had passed . That looked as if the Prime Minister , with an eye on the regular elections in November , was making the biggest claim in Commonwealth political history : that Labor had saved the country . The Opposition 's leader , Arthur W. ( " Artie the Artful " ) Fadden , presumably thought that Curtin 's popularity would rise as Allied prospects in the Pacific improved . Besides , the politicians wanted a showdown over controversial labor , social security and food policies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 800,000 in khaki ) were thinking . But John Curtin 's willingness to face the country next month showed how he was thinking .
