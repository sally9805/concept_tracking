P. TRUSSELL Special to TEl NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , Aug. 10 ? The payment of at least $2,000 by a " high " representative of the Soviet , Union for services in wartime by Communist espionage rings operating out of Washington was declared by the House Committee Ion Un-American Activities tonight . to have been confirmed officially . Representative . T. Parnell , Thomas , committee chairman , stated that the $2,000 , in $20 bills , was handed to Miss Elizabeth T. Bentley , confessed courier for a spy ring , on a New York street corner late in October of 1945 . It Was passed to her , he added , by a man , she had known only as " Al " in her mission of collecting American military and political secrets and forwarding them to Communist headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first testified . before the Senate ( Ferguson ) Investigating Committee July 30 she spoke of a Russian " contact " who was known as " Al . " She said she later had identified " Al " through la photograph as " the first secretary " of the Russian Embassy in Washington . Says FBI Has the Money Mr. Thomas stated that the passing of the $2,000 occurred after Miss Bentley had quit the Communist party and had taken her story of long and intensive espionage to the Federal Bureau ' of Investigation . He said that she turned over the $2,000 to the FBI , along with the story of the street-corner meeting with " Al , " as evidence that she had been in real espionage service with a Communist ring . Other committee members declared that Miss Bentley had also received a Red Star decoration from the Soviet Supreme Council for her work , in which she has implicated in recent testimony many persons in New Deal key positions . Miss Bentley 's testimony has indicated that the $2,000 payment had come even though " Al " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , disappear . ? One of the big facts the committee had been trying to develop , Mr. Thomas asserted , was whether the Soviet Government was making payments , in money or other considerations , to key people in the alleged espionage rings . He added. : " The committee this afternoon has received definite confirmation from high official sources of the testimony which we have taken in executive . session from Miss Bentley as to this $2,000 payment . Working With II . S. Agents " All this time , while Miss Bentley , was accepting this money , she was working in complete cooperation with agents of the United States Government . " The statement by Mr. Thomas came at the ' close of a day of long testimony-taking by the House Committee and of other developments which included the following : In the face of last night 's demand by Alexander S. Panyushkin , Soviet Ambassador to the United States , that Mr. and Mrs. Mikhail Ivanovitch Samarin be delivered to the jurisdiction of the New York Russian Consulate , they were summoned to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any light they might throw on Russian spy rings . Mr. Samarin , a Russian teacher of children of Russian United Nations representatives , had sought protection of the FBI against his return to Russia . It was possible that the Samarins would be questioned in secret session tolnorrOw , this to be followed by public questioning . The State Department ruled that Mrs. Oksana Stepanovna Kosenkina , another Russian teacher , now " resting " at the Soviet consulate in New York , was subject to American subpoena to testify , if she wanted to , as to her desire , or lack of it , to return to , Russia . She was alleged by Soviet authori // ties to have been " kidnapped " by White Russians and " rescued . " Despite the State Department ruling , members of the House committee appeared to shy away from demanding the presence of Mrs. Kosenkina . It was conceded privately that there might sputter in the case a spark of an international incident . Representative Karl E. Mundt , who was acting chairman of the committee during the illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samarin were witnesses there might be no need for the testimony of Mrs. Kosenkina . The House committee called to the stand today three men who were in wartime key Government posts . One of these was William Ludwig Ullman , formerly in the State Department , who had been identified by Miss Bentley as a member of one of the rings which provided military and other information to her . She had associated him especially with the alleged microfilming of secret American documents in the basement of the home of Nathan Gregory Silvermaster , another key post Government official . Mr. Ullman , who lived with the Silvermasters for years in Washington , declined to answer questions concerning photographic apparatus on the constitutional ground that his replies might constitute self-incrimination . On the same ground he refused to admit that he knew how to photograph documents or even how to play tennis . Denies Delivery of Data He denied that he delivered information to Miss Bentley or that he had aided in the microfilming of documents . He called Miss Bentley , in a formal statement , " a liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he knew her or ever had seen her , A wartime major in the Air Forces , on leave from the Treasury Department , Mr. Ullman de , clined to say whether he was or ever had been a member of the Communist party . He said he could not say whether a member of this party could at the same time be a loyal American . Robert T. Miller 3d , accused by Miss Bentley of having given to the spy ring information on State Department matters when he was chief of publications , denied that he was , or ever had been , a. member of the Communist party . He said he had lived two and a half years in Russia , working as a journalist . He testified that his wife worked for the Moscow Daily News . He admitted that he knew Miss Bentley and others she has named as alleged conspirators in the spy ring . He declared that , to him , it was conceivable that a member of the Communist party in the United States could be a loyal citizen at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to his knowledge , he knew no communists . He said he was not even aware that Miss Bentley used to be one , or others of his acquaintance whom she had named . He said he had met Jacob Golos , whom Miss Bentley had identified as her immediate superior in the spy ring , but had not suspected him of being a Communist . Nor , he added , had he discussed communism with Mr. Goias in their two meetings , here and in New York . Activities in Question He asserted that he had not been asked to resign from his confidential Government post , but that questions raised in the State Department concerning his activities here and abroad had possibly spurred his desire to get into private business . Robert E. Stripling , chief committee investigator , read a memorandum , dated July 24 , 1946 , which he described as an official State Department warning that Mr. Miller was a " security risk . " Mr. Stripling said that information developed by the PK according to the memorandum , upported " the conclusion " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk to the security of departmental functions " and recommended that his services be ended . Mr. Miller said that he had been unaware of such a recommendation and added that " I regret it greatly , ' and do not consider it justified . " Duncan Lee , cited by Miss /tintley as a supplier of secret information to her spy ring while he was a major and lieutenant colonel assigned to the Office of Strategic Services , denied that he was a Communist , or ever had been one . Miss Bentley testified that she had collected party dues from him , He denied that and much more . Mr. Lee admitted that he was acquainted with Miss Bentley through an introduction by Miss Mary Watkins Price , named pre- , viously by Miss Bentley as a source of spy ring information from the files of Walter Lippmann , newspaper columnist , while she was his secretary , Miss Price , now an organizer in North Carolina for the Wallace Progressive party , has denied that she rifled Mr. Lippmann 's files . Mr. Lee said that at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well informed product of Vassar College . After about ten months , he testified- , she was no longer welcome in their home . The reason he gave her , Mr. Lee said , was that her ideas and arguments were so far to the left that he believed he might be embarrassed in his OSS post . The real reason , he testified , was that Miss Bentley had become a " personal nuisance " ; " a very lonely and neurotic woman " ; " a very frustrated woman , " and " an emotional weight around our necks . " He stressed that he was speaking for himself and Mrs. Lee . Miss Bentley in Rebuttal Miss Bentley , recalled to the stand , said calmly that , despite Mr. Lee 's testimony that he had given her no OSS information , he had discussed with her : Reports that , ? at that time , before the atomic bomb was revealed , there was something " super-secret " going on at Oak Ridge , Tenn. , where research was in progress , although he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle in China between the Government of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists . OSS . plans concerning communistic control plans in the Balkans . A proposed " exchange " of twelve ' OM operatives for twelve Russian secret police agents , a program that was never realized . Miss Bentley reiterated that she had not . told Mr. Lee that information she was gathering was going to Russia but had told him it was going to Earl Browder , at that time in good grace as head of the American Communist party . Mr. Lee , a former member of the law firm of William J. Donovan , who headed the OSS , told the committee that he was sure Mr. Donovan would like to testify in his behalf . Accepted for the record was a telegram from Otto C. Doering Jr . sent from a Wisconsin vacation spot to Mr. Thomas . It said in part : " As former executive officer of OSS I would be glad to testify before your committee regarding Lee . I want to say now that I knew his work during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSS and to his country . I I have absolute faith in his innocence of the charges made against ' him by Elizabeth Bentley . " Proposes Perjury Action Members of the investigating committee conceded openly today that the testimony thus far had lett them puzzled and disturbed . While Miss Bentley was on the stand to deny the testimony of Mr. Lee Representative F. Edward Hebert , Democrat , of Louisiana , interposed : " Either you or Lee is lying . " He continued : " The record of these hearings is filled with perjury . I confess that I do n't know who js a liar and who is not , but I 'm going to ? find out . I will insist that the Department of Justice bring perjury charges and prosecute . " Representative Mundt cut in : " Some innocent-sounding people are guilty of infamous crimes or innocent people have been injured by infamous testimony . We must find ' the answer . " Mr. Thomas said later that at the close of the hearings the committee would issue a report and a recommendation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling of a blueriobon grand jury to sift the evidence or a demand that Attorney General Tom C. Clark initiate proceediags looking to the prosecution of perjurers.
