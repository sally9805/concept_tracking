txt LONDON . March ** British Government has ordered that all military supplies to Turkey under the Anglo-Turkish agreement shall be stopped , it was learned today . Official quarters in London decline to comment on this development , but it has been evident here for sornel weeks that Turkey could not expect to continue receiving supplies without fulfilling the terms of the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement , which obligated Turkey to render all aid in her power to Britain , While Turkey was obliged to enter the war under her agreement with Britain as soon as Italy attacked France in 1940 , Britain ' fully understood her neutrality in the days when the British were losing the " desert war . " At that time it was felt that a declaration of war by an unprepared Turkey might have enabled the Germans to attack British Near Eastern positions through Turkey . But since the Germans were driven out of North Africa and defeated in eastern Europe by the Red Army the feeling here has been that Turkey could render considerable aid to the Allied cause in southeastern Europe without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised dur- ' ing the Moscow conference , where the Allies decided to put their view before the Turks , and , consequently , meetings were arranged by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt with Premier Ismet Inonu of Turkey . During that conference and afterward the Turks argued that some of their cities , particularly Istanbul , ' were vulnerable to air attack , and ' they asked for more equipment from the United States and Britain . Some of this equipment was sent despite a shortage of Allied shipping , which still remains a limiting factor on the Allied war effort . In spite of these efforts on the part // BRITAIN , U. S. HALT ALL HELP TO TURKS // of Britain and the United States , the Turks have persistently refused to enter the war or grant air and naval bases to the Allies , and these decisions by Turkey have undoubtedly affected the ' war in the eastern Mediterranean . For example , it is felt that with the use of air bases along Turkey 's Aegean coast it would be possible to drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage through the Aegean Sea for any expeditionary force that the Allies might want ter send into ' the Balkans . From bases in Turkey it would also be much easier to bring the growing Allied air power to bear on the Axis positions in the Balkans and , specifically , . to drive Bulgaria , Rumania and Hungary out of the war . The Turks , however , have refused to depart from their ' neutrality , leaving the twenty-five I German divisions in the Balkans to proceed effectively against Partisan groups in Yugoslavia and elsewhere , and the excuse given has been ' that the Allies have not kept up with their schedule of shipments of military equipment , thus leaving Turkey so weak that she could not prepare herself for any retaliation against Turkish territory . It was Soviet Russia that raised the question of Turkey 's position at the Moscow conference and took the strong line that neither ships nor war materials should be wasted on Turkey unless . the Turks were prepared to use them against the Germans . In recent weeks there were further conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during which tire Russians made several alternate suggestions ' as to where supplies could be used to better advantage , and Britain concurred . There has been some support here for the theory that Turkey would eventually came into the war and that in the interest of post-war relations with the Turks the Allies could continue to supply her with arms , but since the Turks are not yet convinced that the Allies will beat Germany the prevailing view is that Turkey is not prepared to enter the war until her help is of little use and that meanwhile the arms can be used to better advantage . Information here suggests that the Turks have not been able to make effective use of the military supplies already sent by the Allies . Even when Allied material has been sent to Alexandretta and Mersin the Turks have not been able to distribute it because of their inadequate facilities at the ports and their poor transport across Anatolia , where the main railroad has only a single track . In a recent debate in the Turkish Parliament one Deputy complained about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allied supplies , - but With the supply of the most ordinary goods required in civilian life . " How do you expect to organize for war , ' he asked , " when you can not even organize the distribution of matches ? " Consequently the Allied point of view is that , if Turkey is not pre-1 pared to fulfill her obligations under the treaty with Britain , that is not Britain 's fault , and that if Turkey is not able to make use of the supplies already sent to her there is no compelling reason to ' send precious ships and supplies tol Turkey unless they are to be used for the purpose of killing Germans . The decision to stop these supplies has not only a military but a political significance because the feeling here is that no nation which does not take a hand in freeing ' Europe from the menace of Germany can expect to have a say in the reconstruction of Europe after the war .                   @ @
