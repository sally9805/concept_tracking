txt Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMER VICHY , France , Oct. 26 ? Chancellor Hitler and Marshal Henri Philippe Petain , after discussing means of " reconstructing " peace in Europe , have come to agreement on the principle of collaboration . Methods of application are yet to be examined . This is the gist of a communication presented this evening to the French Cabinet , which approved it unanimously . And this is all that official circles will reveal of the momentous meeting between the French and German chiefs of State , held on Thursday near Tours in occupied territory . After the Cabinet meeting it was learned that Foreign Minister Paul Baudoin had resigned and that Vice Premier Laval had taken over his post , The United Press reported . M. Baudoin was the last member of the War Cabinet remaining in the Vichy Government . The communiqu ? certainly does not say much . There is every reason to believe that the book of instructions issued to the censors would be more revealing ; there are so many things that it is not permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foremost , the communiqu ? speaks of peace and does not mention war . This will relieve many // AID TO NAZI ' PEACE ' PLEDGED BY VICHY // minds , not only in France but abroad . Second , although the conversations doubtless embraced a wide range of subjects , agreement has been reached solely on principle , leaving its application for future negotiations . The third point is that the communiqu ? was issued from Marshal Petain 's own office , which is not a common occurrence . The document says : " The conversation on Oct. 24 between Chancellor Hitler and Marshal Petain , in the presence of Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Vice Premier Pierre Laval , occurred in an atmosphere of high courtesy . The Marshal was received with honors due to his rank . The conversation that followed between the two leaders gave rise to a general examination of the situation , and particularly of means of reconstructing peace in Europe . The two interlocutors came to agreement on the principle of collaboration . Methods of application are to be examined later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes most observers here as ambitious , however praiseworthy it may be . It is pointed out that after the World War more than thirty States strove to construct peace on this planet ; now one man , Herr Hitler , seeks to undertake a task of almost equal magnitude , since it is not conceivable that peace for Europe can be separated from peace for the whole world . Every echo reaching here from Germany tends to show that Herr Hitler has only this thought in mind and that he desires collaboration . This would serve to explain the events leading to Thursday 's interview . So much for the principle . Some observers here are wondering whether the rub may not come in the application . And it is precisely on this point that details are lacking ? or unrevealed . What will be France 's position in the peaceful reconstruction of Europe ? There is an intuitive feeling that terms might be offered to her that would compare most favorably with those feared four months ago . There are hints of " condominiums " and " autonomous administrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is even talk of certain voracious appetites being moderated . Next , what of Britain ? The logical French mind  --  even among men in the street  --  can not conceive of peace without ending the war . Authorized spokesmen here have given assurance that France will not be induced to enter the fight against Britain . But what of AngloFrench relations if and when peace is restored ? It is conceivable that this question is preoccupying exalted personages , who may feel constrained to seek information , either through normal channels or privately . And what of the United States ? Incidentally , American diplomats were to be seen in the Hotel du Parc today . If there is to be -a . European bloc , how will it affect the Pan American bloc politically and economically ? There is talk of a customs union , of a sort of European autarchy . America can scarcely be expected to look on unconcerned , since it is as interested in peace as are other nations . These and many other questions were in men 's thoughts this evening as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting . Not a few remained to watch them depart afterward , striving to see omens in their respective demeanors . French Eager for More News That the French people fully realized the importance of Marshal Petain 's meeting with the German Chancellor was sufficiently indicated by the run on all newspapers this morning . Swiss sheets were eagerly bought under the impression that they might contain more than the French , but purchasers overlooked the fact that they reach Vichy the day after publication . The French press had little news , all emphasis being placed on the impression that Marshal Petain made on the Germans and the latter 's almost ostentatious courtesy . Herr Hitler 's greeting , " I know you did not wish for war and I regret making your acquaintance in these circumstances , " also was displayed . For the rest , all comment dwelt on the necessity for circumspection and silence , as typified by a sentence in the Journal des Debats , " Who does not recognize the impossibility of revealing anything at this moment " ? Confidence in Marshal Petain 's wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fixed for this morning , was postponed until afternoon when it became clear that M. Laval could not arrive from Paris in time . Nevertheless a crowd gathered outside the Hotel du Parc until his automobile drew up about 1:30 and , despite the cold weather , many waited until the Ministers arrived for the session at 5 o'clock .. But of news there was little ; indeed , the word ran that censorship would be stricter than ever , New Axis Parley Is Predicted Wireless to THE NEW YORE TIMES . STOCKHOLM , Sweden , Oct. 26 ?
