Recent news of invention and engineering : <P> &gt; Firestone Tire &; Rubber Co. - which branched out into batteries , plastics , steel parts , service stations , cotton mills-announced development of a new automobile spark plug that provides better ignition , quicker starts for cold motors . The plug has electrodes coated with polonium , a radioactive element discovered by the late great Marie Curie ( and named for her native Poland ) . The polonium shoots a steady stream of subatomic particles which ionize ( electrify ) the air in the spark gap , make it a better conductor when the spark jumps . <P> &gt; In ordinary metal casting , molten metal is poured into a mold , allowed to cool , then removed . After long experiment , several metallurgical manufacturers have devised a way to cast high-grade metal rods continuously-that is , in an endless strip , as newsprint is made . Molten metal is fed from a reservoir to a water-cooled tube . As the metal flows down and out of the tube , a water spray cools it so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industrial Bulletin of Arthur D. Little Inc . ( Boston consultants ) states that continuously cast rods are free of air cavities , highly uniform in strength . <P> &gt; Airplane engine carburetors have been vastly improved since the old cork-float type , but they still tend to get clogged with ice in a certain temperature-humidity range . This can be prevented by valving in hot air from the exhaust stacks . But if anything goes wrong with the hot-air valve , the engine conks just the same . To get rid of carburetors , fuel-injection systems have been devised to shoot into the cylinders tiny jets of liquid gasoline . <P> This spray is said to burn more smoothly and cheaply than a carburetor mixture , to make possible the use of less volatile gasolines , to prevent icing under any conditions . One of the first German planes shot down last fall in Scotland was found to have a fuel-injection device . In the U. S. , Continental Motors Corp . now equips 75-h.p. engines for light planes with the first commercial U. S. fuel-injection system . Army &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver , Reginald Scott Dean of the U. S. Bureau of Mines held up pieces of steel and brass , dropped them on the floor . They clanged . Mr. Dean then dropped a piece of another metal . There was a faint thump . This " noiseless " metal , as strong and elastic as mild steel , is a heat-treated alloy of copper and manganese . " This , " said Metallurgist Dean , " opens up many new **25;16599;TOOLONG spring suspensions , noiseless gears , a muffler for a whole host of bothersome industrial sounds . " <P> &gt; Coffee is vacuum-packed by some canners because the oxygen in the air diminishes freshness and flavor . It occurred to Engineer Jay Erwin Tone of Des Moines that freshness and flavor might be even better preserved if , after air was pumped from the can , it was replaced by vapor from fresh-ground coffee . After several years of puttering , he invented a big machine which fills 3,000 coffee cans an hour with such vapor.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
