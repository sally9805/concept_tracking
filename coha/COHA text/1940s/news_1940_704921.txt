These five survived a written test held Jan. 23 , taken by eighteen candidates who qualified from among twenty-seven original applicants .

It is a subordinate position to the one he now holds . He took the examination as a result of the recent controversies in the Bronx and Queens . " It certainly is fine to learn that he passed with such a fine mark . We 've all been kidding Bill about it . " Asked whether recent criticism of his policy of using the landfill method of garbage disposal in Queens and Staten Island had prompted him to take the civil service test in order to show people that he was a real expert in that field , Mr. Carey indicated that he had had no such motive .
