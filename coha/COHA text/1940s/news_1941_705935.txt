txt While park oilleials inveighed against stunts which endanger both stunter and rescuers a daredevil parachutist nervously paced his lofty roost atop 1,280 foot Devils Tower and entered upon his fifth day of awaiting rescue this morning . His rescue may prove as spectacular as his arrival on the ninnacle . The lonely king of the tower of rock is George Hopkins , 30 years old , a diminutive , wise cracking former RAF parachute instructor . In dropping from a plane to the obelisk 's tap to win a bet of 550 , he has become the greatest unnatural attraction in a state famed for its freaks of nature . A crowd of nearly 2,000 persons gathered at the base of the tower ' last night watching the cautious efforts to scale the sheer sides . of rock . But the scenery-wise spectators , most of them residents of this area , remained outside of the enclosure to which national park service officials charge tourists 50 cents admission . Climbers to Try Rescue . A still ' larger crowd is expected today when a well planned attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from his perch . If that falls , he may be rescued by a blimp or a helicopter . At Akron. 0. , the blimp Reliance was ordered to take off for the scene this morning . However it is not ex. petted to arrive here until Tuesday because its limited flying range necessitates making the trip in short flights . Earl Brockelby of Rapid City , S. D .. from whom Hopkins won the bet , has asked a west coast airplane company to send its helicopter , a vertical flying machine . Experts Going to Tower . En route here by plane from New York to offer advice and assistance were Jack Durrance , New Hampshire skier who successfully climbed the tower several years ago , and Merrill of Rockport , Mass ? also an experienced mountain climber . Superintendent Edmund B. Rogers ' of Yellowstone park , who also is su. pervisor of Devil 's Tower National park , arrived here this afternoon to take charge of the rescue operations .

Peak la Lava Blister . " We of the park service , " said Superintendent Rogers , " hate to Jeop ? ardize the lives of our men for a ( stunt that some one thought was smart . " Devil 's Tower is a geological freak believed to be unduplicated on the earth 's surface . There are several theories concerning its formation but the one generally accepted is that it was a lava blister that formed millions of years ago during the Cambrian age . At the time of the Black Hills up . lift a gigantic protrusion of molten rock is believed to have occurred in an earth fault . Upon slowly cooling , the center crystalized while the ad. jacent ground , of different formation , gradually eroded , leaving the naked tower of about 400 million tons of rock known as basalt . The tower is composed of hundreds of columns , each about five feet in diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gently sloping , but generally level top , has sufficient dirt to grow cactus , Walls Almost Vertical . The awesome formation rises more than 1,200 feet above the nearby Belle Fourche river on its north side and is about 800 feet above the countryside which rises toward its base , Its walls are almost vertical , ' the top , which is 200 by 400 feet , being nearly as large as the base . More than 30 persons have successfully scaled the tower , the first one being Will Rogers , a local rancher , who used wooden pegs to reach the top on July 4 , 1893 . His wife was the first and only woman to make the climb . It was on to this comparativelysmall area that Hopkins , a Texas aviator , bet his friend he could make a landing from a plane . Back of him was a parachuting record that he , claimed included service with Chiang Kai.shek 's Chinese army and with the British air force at Dunkirk . Plunges from Plane . Last Wednesday he flew over the tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. D. At a height of about 600 feet above the top of the tower , Hopkins stepped out of the plane . Ice told later of banking his plane and seeing Hopkins pull his parachute 's guide line to bring him down close to the nearest edge of the tower . Had he ta.len only a few feet short . Ice said , his body would have been smashed against the rock side of the pinnacle . But he landed safely , rolling his 115 pound body along the ground to break his fall and wrap down the ' chute . His first night on his tight little island was not a pleasant one . Cold winds swept the tower top , a quarter of a mile in the Wyoming sky , and a light snow fell . But the weather since has been moderately warm . Get . Air Traffic Cops His feat attracted so much attention that 1n a few days so many planes were flying over the tower that an air warden had to be appointed to control the traffic . The planes dropped Hopkins an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2,400 feet of rope for his perilous descent . Some trouble was encountered in delivering water , the large tin containers breaking when they landed but this trouble was overcome by using smaller tins . Hopkins dropped notes tied to stones in which he asked for newspapers . particularly the comic sections . fruit juices and coffee , all of which were dropped to him , the coffee in thermos containers . He 's Fine but Lonely . In his notes Hopkins joked with the crowd below and told them not . to worry , that he " felt fine but am lonely and will be glad when I get down . " Those on the ground communicated with him with large megaphones which they used from a large natural ledge about 250 feet up from the base of the tower . The crowd was unable to hear Hopkin 's voice when he occasionally tried to call to them .
