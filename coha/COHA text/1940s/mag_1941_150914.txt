Up &; down U.S. industry this week a new economic paradox was in the making . Government economists talked about the " priorities unemployment problem . " But for a lot of people who would soon be out of jobs , out of victuals , out at the seat of the pants , it might just as well be called plain depression . <P> At this month 's beginning , only 2% of non-defense manufacturers responding to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey reported that they had felt the pinch of priorities . But at last week 's end new answers raised the average to 10-15% . Nine out of ten others expected drastic curtailment within the next six months . This meant non-defense plants darkened in one part of a town while defense industries worked round the clock in another , whole cities knocked out while other cities boomed , depression and prosperity side-by-side . <P> Started this week by OPM 's labor division was a survey of five cities where the effect of priorities was closest at hand and likely to hurt the most : Meadville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerators and electrical appliances ) ; Evansville , Ind . ( refrigerators and automotive appliances ) ; Quincy , Ill. ( stove foundries ) ; Newton , Iowa ( washing machines ) . After the survey , OPM hoped to give these areas new defense work*- using the power it obtained last month to write compulsory subcontracting , plus special treatment for blighted communities , into Army &; Navy contracts . Question was whether enough could be done , or whether it could be done in time . <P> The Case of Meadville . To most of Meadville 's 18,919 people the priorities cloud last week looked no bigger than a man 's hand . They knew that Talon , Inc. ( zipper manufacturers ) had been unable to buy any metal since Aug. 1 , had laid off 800 of its 5,219 Meadville workers , had only enough inventories to keep going until next month . But Meadville has led a charmed life . Thanks to Talon 's spectacular growth and a new American Viscose Corp . rayon plant , it scarcely felt the de pression of the ' 305 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose ; newspapers as far away as Manhattan publicized it as a " depression-proof city " whose " streets were paved with gold . " <P> Hence Meadville was slow to believe that depression could strike while the whole nation boomed in ' 41 . The layoff of Talon 's first 800 was hardly noticed ; they were boys and girls fresh out of high school , mostly from neighboring towns and farms . Some of them found jobs at the Viscose plant across French Creek , some quietly went back home . The State Employment Service was busier with the seasonal layoff of cooks and waitresses in nearby resort hotels than with Meadville 's first priorities casualties . To many a citizen , the " priorities problem " meant the serious difficulty up at Allegheny College ( 725 students ) , which could not get enough locks for the doors of its new girls ' dormitory .
