Major Charles Dinwiddie , Army Provost Marshal in Houston , Tex. , strode into the Texas Washer Co. ' s plant not long ago and did n't like what he saw . Texas Washer makes fins for Army mortar shells , but Major Dinwiddie could find not one armed guard around its plant . Whereupon Owner Wayne A. Baird grinned at the irate Major , told him to " walk through that door . " As Dinwiddie obeyed , Baird pushed a button and every one of Texas Washer 's 100-odd workmen dropped his tools , trained a sawed-off shotgun at the startled officer . " Just double duty , " said Baird . " Every employe his own guard , and they all can shoot , too . " <P> Double duty is Wayne Baird 's middle name : for more than two years he has been doubling on war work with his friend Anthony R. Engler , owner-manager of Texas Specialty Co. , whose tiny plant backs up to Baird 's . Elderly Wayne Baird 's plant used to turn out small metal parts for oil-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October 1940 they landed a joint $200,000 shell-fin contract which they executed with such success that last month they snagged a new one . This time it was for $1,000,000-about 40 times their combined annual volume in peacetime . <P> Baird and Engler contrived to do all their war work without one penny of Government funds for new equipment . When they needed new machines they rigged up their own Rube Goldberg contraptions ( Baird is proudest of a crane he made out of pulleys ' , sash cords and weights from Texas Washer windows ) . They bought their materials jointly , ran production lines from one plant into the other . Recently they were thrilled to hear that they were due for an Army-Navy E to reward their joint efforts ( the first dual plant award in the U.S. and the first Ordnance award in the Houston area ) . <P> But Baird and Engler , who both have terrible tempers , almost came to blows deciding whose plant to use for the ceremonies , whose could fly the E flag thereafter . Major Dinwiddie intervened with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will play a new kind of double feature : on that neutral ground the Army will present an E flag apiece to Wayne Baird and Anthony Engler.
