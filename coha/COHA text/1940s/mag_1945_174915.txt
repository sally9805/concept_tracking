One day last week Roy Barton White , president of the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad Co. , was surprised to read in the newspapers that he , his railroad and four officials of the B. &; 0 . were in trouble with the Government . Montana 's Senator Burton K. Wheeler , chairman of the powerful Interstate Commerce Committee , had sent a sizzling letter about the B. &; O. 's finances to OWMR Boss John W. Snyder , who is still filling the job of Federal Loan Administrator . <P> Senator Wheeler promptly made the letter public , without the courtesy of sending a copy to Roy White . In it he suggested that it was high time the B. &; O. paid back the $82 million still owed the Reconstruction Finance Corp . Reasoned Senator Wheeler : since 1939 the B. &; O. has made a net profit after taxes and interest payments of $100 million , plus a bookkeeping profit of $35 million from the repurchase at bargain prices of its bonds in the open market . Finally Wheeler charged that " Wall Street speculators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks . . . there has been a frenzied speculation in the company 's bonds . " <P> At week 's end , Roy White rose to his own defense . In a letter to Senator Wheeler , he pointed out that the B. &; 0 . had used its war profits to reduce its longterm , high-interest funded debt by $100 million , cut its annual fixed charges by $5.5 million .
