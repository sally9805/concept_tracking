txt The House Appropriations Committee bound ail its sub-committees today to stay within the Bureau of Budget recommendations , and in the Senate the resolution by Senator Harrison to set up it joint Congressional committee to coordinate the activities of the revenue and appropriation groups of both branches was unanimously adopted . On motion of Representative Woodrum , Democrat of Virginia , the Appropriations Committee adopted by a vote of 14 to 11 a resolution which instructed all subcommittees not to report bills carrying figures greater in the aggregate than those recommended by President Roosevelt in his budget message . This action came after Senators Adams , Democrat of Colorado , and Vandenberg , Republican of Michigan , began a bi-partisan economy campaign with speeches in the Senate , and , in the course of a rather sharp debate , Senators Borah , Republican of Idaho , and Glass , Democrat of Virginia , demanded assurances that the proposed joint committee would- undertake its studies with a sincere desire to examine with care all requests for naval expansion . Farm Committee a Target The House Committee fight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by Representative Cannon of Missouri , which last year voted $225,000,000 in farm parity payments not called for by the budget . Authoritative sources said previous votes had indicated that there was a much greater majority in the committee in support of efforts of Representative Woodrum , and Taylor , Democrat of Colorado , who is chairman of the whole coin , mittee , to hold all appropriation bills within the $8,424,000,000 budget . It was on the farm benefit payment question that the majority was reduced to three . One member pointed out that the committee 's action did not prevent any reductions in items , and he predicted that bills coming from the committee would represent a total considerably reduced from the budget figures . The action was taken , it was said , after committee leaders had explored the government 's financial position and had discussed the suggestion that the closest paring of items , plus new taxes and a rise in the $45,000,000,000 debt limit might be necessary to insure sound government finances in the fiscal year 1941 . A Skeptic as to Congress 's Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in the President 's budget , " pointing out that the deficit could be kept down to $1,716,000 ; - 000 in 1941 only if there was a recapture of $700,000,000 in the capital assets of various Federal agencies , plus new taxes of $460,000,000 , and , in addition , appropriations were limited to $8,424,000,000 .. " There is no one- so naive as to // HOUSE GROUP PUTS CURBS ON SPENDING // believe that Congress will stick to the budget figures , " he said , " so we might as well get ready for the worst . It looks like we will have to trim the defense program funds . " The defense funds represent the largest outlay in the budget , running slightly more than $1,800,000 , - 000 . The House Democratic steering committee conferred with the President today , and members said that Mr. Roosevelt made it clear he wanted Congress to stay within the budget figure , and hoped that it would do nothing that would require the debt limit to be raised . Warmer to Harrison Plan There seemed to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was received there from the Senate late in the day . Prior to the Senate debate on passage of the Harrison resolution , Senator , the minority leader , announced that in view of the assurances by the majority leaders as to the scope of the proposed study he would not oppose the resolution as it stood . Senator Vandenberg stated , however , that while he welcomed Senator Harrison 's plan , " that effort is bound to fail except as it includes under the promise of the Senator from Mississippi some realistic exploration of what we got for our money out of the eight or ten or twelve billions we have appropriated for national defense in a decade , and what our naval and military policy is going to be from here out . " Senator Adams said : " The President , with a twinkle in his eye , has put this baby on our doorstep . " The Colorado Democrat asked that Congress refuse to make " tremendous appropriations " for defense . The budget total of $1,800,000,000 is 32 per cent earmarked for defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was in order to equip this country " to fight nobody . " " I think we can make the savings , " he said , " by reducing appropriations for a war which is not coming . " And I have the apprehension that once we have built up a navy , once we have fortified ' Islands so far off that we do not know where they are , there is a temptation to use them . " Senator Adams added that any increase in items in the budget without decreases in others would mean that " we must break through the $45,000,000,000 debt limit or levy new taxes . " " There Is no painless method of balancing the budget , " he added .
