Hans Erni is one of Switzerland 's most skillful and mysterious painters . Recently an Erni show in Geneva drew 3,000 people in two weeks , and raised a lot of questions . Why , the abstractionists wanted to know , did Erni sully the purity of his abstract compositions by introducing classical figures and anatomical charts ? And why , asked the conservatives , did he scratch up his photographically accurate pictures with abstract shapes ? <P> To get at the answers , a reporter visited Erni in his whitewashed Lucerne studio . He found the 40-year-old artist working under fluorescent light " because it 's steady and constant . " Black-browed Hans Erni , who looks like an attenuated Max Schmeling , was knee-deep in machine parts , geometrical constructions , drawings of crystals , and an assortment of scientific instruments , including a Cellophane-wrapped microscope . Because he thinks specialization is harmful , Erni devotes part of each day to studying chemistry , mechanics , biology , zoology and the Greek classics . <P> " Art for art 's sake , " says Erni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matters . " The ideas that Erni tries to put on canvas are often understandable enough in themselves , but that does not make them any easier to picture . For example , how should an artist express the thoughts of a pregnant woman sitting on the ground somewhere in Europe ? The first part of Erni 's solution was to get the woman on canvas as realistically as he could and give her ah expression of dull waiting . Then , just over her head , he drew a tangled cat 's cradle of white lines . He called the whole thing Young Woman in 1942 . <P> Erni has painted his own wife and child playing in front of a forest of blood vessels , and himself chalking abstractions on the night air . What goes on inside the body and inside the mind , he says , is just as important as the outside . If it were also as easy to paint , Erni 's work would be much less mysterious to his admirers .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
