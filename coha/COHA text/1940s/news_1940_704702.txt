txt On Administering Relief Its Return to the States Considered Likely to Lead to Abuses To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have just read your editorial " Reform of Relief " in which you point out that certain officials from New England and Middle Atlantic States advocate the administration of relief by States on the basis of aid grants from the Federal Government . You comment that so personal a service as relief should be kept as close as possible to the people , that " in economy , in adjustability and in the elimination of the more serious dangers of centralized political control the superiority of this solution to the present relief system can hardly be questioned . " Do you feel that the return of administration to the States and local communities would be a " soiution " for the relief system ? I disagree , and believe that any person viewing the matter from a practical , not a political , standpoint will realize that " logic " demands that the system be continued as it operates at present , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any sane person shudders to think of the consequences of turning relief funds allotted by the Federal Government over to the mercy of local authorities . Ask any informed person where the real trouble has been in the huge job of making WPA a functioning work relief organization . They will tell you that it has been in fighting off efforts of local political machines to control the WPA in their bailiwick , lock , stock and barrel . I am thinking of the smaller cities and communities principally , where politically appointed boards or officials would not only determine who got relief , as they do today , but handle the money involved . Were you able to examine the files of the Federal Government in these matters , you would find that the majority of cases involving attempt to divert relief funds point to loan . ' politicians who felt they could " get away with it " because of their local connections . What stopped them ? Simply Federal law . You use the word " relief " in the general sense . I am talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some commodities or a small check . Experience shows that the operation of forty-eight different work relief programs , with their many subdivisions , would help build up the greatest set of local political machines you ever saw . When we can get through the State Legislatures of the nation such legislation as the Hatch act and the present relief act , with its stringent penal provisions against political activity , we might be ready for the administration of a work relief program by the States . Until that time it needs , as the foremost of our national problems , the protection of Federal law and the coordination of Federal operation under whatever Administration may be facing the problem .

Vacation Funds Needed TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In six weeks it will be Summer at Hartley Farm , Towaco , in the Northern New Jersey hills . This is the vacation farm maintained by Hartley House Settlement . During June , before school children are free to come and enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , we want to make the camp available to West Side mothers with children of pre-school age . With a large percentage of our members on some form of relief , we must shoulder the expense of most of the school children 's visits during July and August . This does not leave space one budget  --  already stretched  --  for the mothers and smaller children who need a holiday before they face the strain of a long Summer under crowded living conditions . At Hartley Farm we have the room and equipment . All we need is transportation ( 95 cents a round trip from New York ) and the actual cost of providing for those who come . Eleven dollars covers train fare , board and lodging for a mother and pre-school child for one week . Any contribution , no matter how small , which will help us send some of our neighborhood mothers with small children for a holiday in the country will be gratefully received at Hartley House , 413 West Forty-sixth Street . GRACE HARTLEY MEAD , President of Hartley House . New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The tragedy at Little Falls brings to mind once more a question that has long puzzled me . That is why Pullman berths are invariably made so that the sleeper 's head is forward . To me and to others with whom I have talked the present method is most conducive to serious accidents . With the sleeper 's head pointing forward , it must take the full shock of any sudden stoppage , such as occurred at Little Falls at the time of the wreck . It is conceivable that some of the fatalities in that wreck were due solely to this . The sleepers ' necks could have been broken when the momentum carried them forward with terrific force against the headboard . On the other hand , were berths made so that the sleepers ' feet pointed forward , it is equally conceivable that the passengers would have suffered only some broken legs . F. D. Maluon . New York , April 26 , 1940 . School Costs Condemned To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Marian B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds a ready echo in Manhasset , whose taxpayers , after having listened to impassioned pleas at school budget meetings , discover to their dismay that they have been wheedled into paying school taxes whose amount almost equals those of the combined county , town and village taxes . It is n't education that costs so much money , but the irrelevant accessories , shrewdly promoted by superintendent , faculties , school boards and a goodly number of emotional mothers who , lacking foresight , have become their handmaidens . Other worthy mothers will approve of any other activities , even if they mean still more money to pay , so long as the children are occupied by them , thus giving them more time to devote to bridge afternoons , lectures , beauty parlor conferences and other pastimes to kill time .

Free Carfare Held Negligible Policemen and Firemen Protest Plan to Make Them Pay Transportation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In a letter to THE TIMES Peter Williamson suggests that policemen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase revenue . Speaking as a fireman , I go along with Mr. Williamson 100 per cent , as , I believe , do the majority of firemen ? provided we be permitted to travel in civilian attire . I wonder if Mr. Williamson or many , if any , citizens realize that , in uniform , we are at their call , on or off duty , for assistance in disturbances or other contingencies . If , in giving the required services , we are late for duty we have to stand trial and possible fines . Do citizens realize that we are required on occasions to protect them from bandits or other criminals and that we are not permitted to carry any weapons of defense ? Does n't Mr. Williamson know that recently a fireman , unarmed , disarmed and arrested a bandit after a hold-up , recovered the stolen property and turned the bandit and property over to the police ? We have to pay for damages to our uniforms whether in public service or not .

A Policeman 's Opinion To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Peter I. Williamson recommends that policemen and firemen be required to pay fare on the city transportation lines . Let me , as a retired policeman after twenty-five years ' service , tell him a few facts . A policeman is always on duty even during his " off patrol time . " He is always subject to call by his superior officers or by private citizens whether , or not he is in uniform . Riding on city transportation lines he is just as nine ' ) on duty as the train guard or the motorman  --  more so , in fact , because he is not infrequently called on to risk his life in defense of citizens and their property . Some of us have been killed in subway brawls . Firemen are called on for similar duties and they are not permitted to carry arms , as the police can do .

A recent article in THE TIMES announced that the transfer of overtime parking cases from a downtown court to an uptown court would affect some 50,000 cases a year . The fact that , probably , an equal number of cases are settled in uptown courts gives a rough indication of the number of overtime parking tickets which arc dealt out in the city annually . These tickets are not only given to parkers in busy districts at busy hours , but are also placed on cars parked in front of the owners ' residences on side streets in the middle of the night . The regular $2 parking fine is a nuisance and an unreasonable expense to city residents who do not wish to pay a garage charge every time they leave their cars for two hours . For New Jersey residents who are already burdened with excessive bridge charges for getting in and out of the city it Is practically prohibitive . Ca n't the city allow parking in the less busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect revenue in that manner rather than under the constant threat of " revocation of your license " along with other dire warnings ? We Jerseyites want to contribute to the Greater New York Fund . New York City makes it difficult for us to do so by taxing us this arbitrary fee every time we park in the open air . DEAN R. GMNEY . Ridgewood , N. J. , April 27 , 1940 . Editorials Are Approved TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A reader protests that " there has been apparent in THE TIMES a spirit of severe excoriation of everything German and a corresponding favor of everything British . " That , of course , is an exaggeration ; nevertheless , I would like to ask : What is there in the nature and methods of Nazi Germany that calls for approval ? THE TIMES , in its editorials on Germany , has merely been saying what the vast majority of Americans are thinking  --  and saying it , I believe , rather more temperately than most of us might . As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approval and encouragement than we have thus far given them , since they , along with the French and the Norwegians , are fighting to uphold a way of life that Is essentially our own .
