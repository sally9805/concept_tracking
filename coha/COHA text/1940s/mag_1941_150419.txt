Forty-nine men have headed the New York Stock Exchange since 1817 ; all were bankers , brokers or otherwise emblematic Wall Streeters . But last week a special Stock Exchange committee broke this 124-year tradition , named a farmer-politician to the presidency . The man : big , dimpled , platter-eared Emil Henry Schram , who never owned more than 100 shares of stock in his life . <P> If Wall Street 's bankers &; brokers were peeved at this invasion , they were too beaten to protest . The beating , now in its twelfth year , had pushed Stock Exchange trading volume ( on an annual basis to the lowest level since 1914 , despite a 141% increase in the number of stocks listed since then . Stock Exchange seats sold for $20,000 , cheapest since 1898 . The Exchange had three new presidents in ten years , greeted each one like a savior . But Richard Whitney wound up in Sing Sing , Charles Gay in a small brokerage office , Bill Martin in an Army camp . And business got worse than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try again . Its spark plug was Paul Vincent Shields , one of the few brokers who know their way around Wash ington . Broker Shields convinced his fellow committeemen that the biggest obstacle to Wall Street 's recovery was the eight-year squabble between the Exchange and the Government . Hence their best bet was a Washington man . So they checked over 50 prospects , finally lit on Emil Schram . He waited a week before saying yes , but he was tickled at getting the job . Reason : he was not too happy at RFC . <P> Emil Schram looks like a police lieutenant in a tough Chicago district . Until 1933 , he was a successful dirt farmer . A native of Peru , Ind. , he left a coal company bookkeeper 's job at 21 to take charge of a 5,000-acre down-at-the-cribs farm in the Southern Illinois Valley . In three years he boosted corn production from 12,000 to 110,000 bushels . Now Schram owns a one-third interest in the farm ; last year it produced 35,000 bushels of wheat , 105,000 bushels of corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the State Legislature to fight for farmers ' rights , made a lobby-hobby of irrigation and flood control . That caught the eye of Jesse Jones , who hired him to take over RFC 's Drainage , Levee and Irrigation Division . <P> Emil Schram took RFC-banking in his stride . His record of less than one-half of 1% defaults on irrigation loans made him a Jones favorite . A good administrator , he acquired titles on new Government boards and bureaus ( mostly Jones-dominated ) almost as fast as his boss . Besides his RFC chairmanship , he is an officer , director or member of the Electric Home &; Farm Authority , Export-Import Bank , Defense Plant Corporation , Federal Prison Industries , Inc. , Rubber Reserve Co. , National Power Policy Committee , three others . Only a fortnight ago he was named to OPM 's priorities division , got OPMites mad as hops by taking the Stock Exchange job .
