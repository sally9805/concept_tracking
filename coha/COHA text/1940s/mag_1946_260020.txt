Chile 's presidential campaign , made necessary by the death in June of President Rios , was under way in the sleet and snow of Andean winter . Torn by feuds and prides that cut as deep as cleavages among the leftists , conservatives could unite on no single man . Chileans had been about ready to swing to the right , but many now hoped for a middle way . With four candidates in the field , it was a wide-open race after all . <P> The winner would face problems that could hardly be handled from an easy chair . Chile had become the international Thin Man . The cost of living had doubled since 1939 . A dozen eggs cost 60 , an ordinary shirt $6 and the average worker earning about $1 a day was out of luck . Even Chile 's famed social laws , which insured him against practically everything , were powerless to buy him shirt or eggs . From his predicament spiraled massive social problems : poor public health ( devastating tuberculosis and infant mortality rates ) , declining industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulano de Tal , the common man , was so weary of cramming into broken-down trolleys , standing in line for tea , and going without a new shirt that he was apt to buy a cheap bottle of vino and say to hell with it all . Or , working at 75 a day in Lota 's undersea coal mines where cave-ins occur almost daily , and living in a hillside of hovels where each year more babies die than are born , he turned to Communism . <P> As in so many Latin countries , cheap food would save the day . But half the land lies idle , much of it in the grip of the feudal hacienda-owners . And though nearly half the population lives and works on the land , the country imports huge quantities of food . <P> Chile 's brightest hopes lie in the half-Socialist , half-RFC Development Corporation , whose projects-a major steel mill , the Spring Hill oilfield , a copper processing plant , a new fishing industry-could in the long run raise the level of production . But the Chilean man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to the new President .
