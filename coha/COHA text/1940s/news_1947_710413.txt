txt Without minimizing the grave conditions faced by Great Britain , reassuring words of hope and courage for the future were spoken in Boston today by Lord Inverchapel . British Ambassador to the United States , shown here , left , with Bernard Ponsonby Sullivan , British Consul-General in Boston , prior to his address at the annual meeting of the Boston Chamber of Commerce . Lord Inverchapel told of the progress already made . Britain will work out its almost overwhelming postwar problems , and in so doing it will put new heart into the democracies of Europe , Lord Inverchapel , British Ambassador to the United States , confidently predicted today , in an address at the Annual Luncheon Meeting of the Boston Chamber of Commerce in the Hotel Statler , " Our task today , " he said , " is first to put our country on a paying basis ? paying for its food . its raw materials , and paying hack its debts ? and , at the same lime , to reconcile the demand by the working man for greater economic liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has taken centuries to win . " That my country will work out this problem . I have no doubt at all . When it is apparent that we have done so , we shall , I make bold to say . put new heart and fresh spirit into the democracies of Europe , which may well lead to a rebirth comparable only with the great liberal movement of the 19th century . " Trading Nations Trading nations like Britain . and to a large extent the United States , " can not live set about with bankrupt and poverty-stricken neighbors. " he asserted . If our industrial systems . yours and nut 's , are to survive  --  and better still , to flourish  --  they can only do so if other parts of the world are reaping the benefit of our production and are in a position to sell us the product of their own industry . We have felt hound to make as full a contribution as we can . even at extra sacrifice to ourselves , to help our western European neighbors to start again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's own huge debt , it has contributed not less than smoo , nonmon in gifts , loans , and grants to countries devastated by the war . In addition . 10 per cent of British manpower , he said . still is tied to the armed forces because of commitments abroad  --  entailing enormous additional expense  --  and in the face of critical manpower shortage in industry and mines at home . " You may say that this is foolish . " he said , " and . on a strictly accounting basis . perhaps it is . But you cannot. scrutinize world issues such as these through the lenses of the accountant 's spectacles . We have to look to the future . " Prophets of doom , Lord Inverehapel admitted . are saying once ' rain , as they often have said before in times of crisis , that Britain is " going to the dogs . " But , he added , " we certainly have not found our way to them yet , though possibly we have at times been uncomfortably close to the kennel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " that the difficulties and disappointments of these postwar years  --  and such years are invariably dreary  --  must be turned into opportunity , for such we have made them in the past . This , in spite of all , is the spirit in which my fellow countrymen are facing the present . If you are interested , watch them closely . You will see them prevail . " The great difficulty in Britain today , he explained , is that so many things have to be done at the same time before the wheels can really be set to turning at full speed again . Exports Needed " We must get back our export trade in order to feed ourselves , because we get half of what we eat from abroad , because we do not like borrowing from other people , and because we want to be in a position to pay back the loans and credits which have already been made , " he said . Britain , said Lord Inverchapel , does not aim to return to the - good old days " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those days . " If there ever has been a determination in the hearts of the people of Britain , " he said . " it is that endemic unemployment shall never return , a determination that . man not only has the right to refuse to work if he is not satisfied with the conditions offered to him , but to expect that society shall be so constructed that there is always work for a willing working man . "
