When dapper , high-strung Brigadier General Jacques Leclerc , commander of the French Second Armored Division , burst into Paris , he carried a cane . It was the same cane with which , when he fought the Axis in Africa , he used to draw sketches in the sand at military conferences . <P> The General is the man nobody knows . <P> Jacques Leclerc is a nom de guerre . His real name is still a secret ( to protect his family from the Nazis ) . Quick-tempered , a stickler for efficiency , the General has no patience with fumbling aides . Last week , on the road to Paris , his nerves jumped raggedly .. At a press conference he parried all questions with caustic comments . <P> The man called Leclerc was born 42 years ago near Amiens . He graduated from Saint-Cyr , France 's West Point . A major in 1940 , he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans . He escaped , riding a bicycle some 375 miles to the frontier . <P> From there Leclerc made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in the Cameroons . In long , quick strokes over the desert , he harassed the Italians in Fezzan . When Montgomery began his march toward Tripoli , Leclerc moved his force north from Fort Lamy , over 1,200 miles of desert and mountains in 39 days . From Tripoli , he advanced with Montgomery into Tunisia .
