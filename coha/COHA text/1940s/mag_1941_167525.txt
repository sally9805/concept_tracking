Two years in jail and a $10,000 fine was the sentence meted out last week by a Federal court in Chicago to Esquire 's publisher , David Smart , his brother Alfred and their broker Arthur Greene . The charge : milking the public of $1,325,000 by artificially rigging the price of Esquire-Coronet , Inc. stock ( which rose from $7 to $12.25 while 153,000 shares were being distributed-TIME , May 12 ) . Lighter-sentenced were four New York and Chicago brokers , three Esquire employes . <P> But the Esquire manipulators , pleading vagueness about the Securities &; Exchange Act , got off lightly . They were told that jail sentences would be suspended if fines were paid by 4 o'clock that afternoon . The smart Smarts raised the money promptly . <P> Esquire ( " More Smileage " ) is no such bonanza as it was in 1937 ( just before the Smarts sold big blocks of stock ) when it reached an average 575,519 monthly circulation peak and made $807,865 net . But it still pays a tidy profit . From last year 's $221,431 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 ) .
