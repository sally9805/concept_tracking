When World War II ends , it will not have ended the dislocations of the modern world . It did not begin , as did World War I , with a passionate conviction on both sides that victory would automatically end the evils that led to war . It is not likely to end in the mood of the Armistice of 1918 , when millions believed that peace terms alone could bring into existence a new , warless and equitable world order . <P> But World War II will end , and last week President Roosevelt and the U. S. State Department set citizens to pondering on what the world will be like when it does . No spectacular moves led to the pondering . But in a week marked by a ferocious arithmetical dispute between Republicans and Democrats about the national debt ( see p. 1 6 ) , and by President Roosevelt 's stern condemnation of Russia ( see p. 77 ) , a series of Presidential and State Department moves clarified U. S. foreign policy more sharply than at any time since the war began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transatlantic Clipper at Baltimore but , unlike returning Ambassadors Kennedy and Davies , did not come out swinging for the third term . He rushed to the State Department , conferred with Secretary Hull , stopped at the White House . To reporters he would say only that he had 50 to 75 things to discuss with officials , made some inconsequential remarks look more important by making them off the record . <P> &gt; A couple of hours before Ambassador Bullitt landed , President Roosevelt an nounced that Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles would " proceed shortly to Europe to visit Italy , France , Germany and Great Britain . " The reason : " This visit is solely for the purpose of advising the President and the Secretary of State as to present conditions in Europe . Mr. Welles will , of course , be authorized to make no proposals or commitments . . . . " <P> &gt; An hour after the President 's announcement , Secretary Hull made a homespun statement of his own . Because of the war , he said , and its effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations with neutral governments . He made it clear that these conversations involved no world plan for peace . But they were preliminary inquiries looking toward the establishment of a sound inter national economic system , a world-wide reduction of arms . Their chief aim : to provide economic stability after the war . <P> Discretion . These were the moves that launched a thousand rumors . Radiorators and columnists did not hesitate to announce as fact ( each had it on unimpeachable authority ) a dozen conflicting guesses . Most of them focused on the lean and elegant figure of Sumner Welles . A career diplomat , 47 , educated at Groton , Harvard , and the embassies at Tokyo , Buenos Aires and Havana , Sumner Welles is a casting director 's dream of a diplomat , except for his thinning hair . His diplomatic experience has ranged from mediating in the Dominican Republic at 30 to seeing him self hanged in effigy in Cuba in 1933 and hearing mobs shout " Down with Welles .
