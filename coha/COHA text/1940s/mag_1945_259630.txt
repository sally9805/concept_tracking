Mississippi 's splenetic Senator Theodore G. ( " The Man " ) Bilbo addressed the chair as though he had just been stabbed with a hatpin . Eleanor Roosevelt 's name was up for Senate confirmation as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly . The Senator objected , guessed that 98% of his constituents would also object , and told his colleagues that he had written a book giving his reasons for objecting. * After that , North Dakota 's Republican Senator William Langer reared up to announce that the whole United Nations setup was a square peg in a round hole , a phony and a lot of bunk . <P> The Senate , which had heard all this before , calmly went about confirming Mrs. Roosevelt 's appointment . Quickly they approved the rest of the first-string team the President wanted to send to London-former Secretary of State Ed Stettinius , Democratic Senator Tom Connally , Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg , Secretary of State Jimmy Byrnes . But the debate had only begun . As the names of Harry Truman 's five alternate delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up with a glitter in his eye . <P> Embarrassing Questions . Lawyer John Foster Dulles properly escaped his probing , and Fulbright questioned the qualifications of Congressmen Sol Bloom of New York and Charles Eaton of New Jersey only by implication . But he wanted to know why Delaware 's John G. Townsend , chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee , rated the trip to London . Did Frank C. Walker , the former Democratic Postmaster General , have any experience in foreign affairs ? The average age of the five , he mused , was over 65 . <P> Cried Kentucky 's 58-year-old Senator Alben Barkley : " That does not annoy me in the slightest . . . . Mr. Walker is by no means a doddering old man . . . . " <P> Montana 's Democratic Burton K. Wheeler protested too : " Mr. Walker has just as much experience as any of the others mentioned . . . . " <P> Snapped Fulbright : " In other words , he knows just as little . . . . " <P> As the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names had been rushed through the Foreign Relations Committee with hardly a moment 's consideration . Had anyone considered sending a physicist ? A soldier of World War II ? " I am not attacking the character of these gentlemen , " he explained . " But we assume our representatives are being sent to London with a purpose-not to be good fellows , not to discuss Montana or whatever Mr. Walker is familiar with . . . or the strawberry crop in Delaware . . . . " <P> When Senator Fulbright was through , two Republican liberals , Minnesota 's Joseph Ball and Oregon 's Wayne Morse , commended him for his stand . <P> As everyone had expected , the Senate disregarded all this argument , voted for the men Harry Truman had appointed . If the President was leaning over backward to avoid Woodrow Wilson 's great mistake-turning a cold shoulder to U.S. politicians during the peacemaking-the Senate was more than willing to copy the stance . But the debate had made it plain that a knot of young progressives would not stay quiet if they thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . <P> *For news of another Bilbo peeve , see THEATER.
