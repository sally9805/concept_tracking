most beautiful autumn weather of he century . Day after day the sky over London was clear and sunny . Nights of sharp cool moonlight brought no bombings . Late afternoons the streets had a holiday air under the silver barrage balloons ; when you saw them end-on against the bright patches of sky and cloud they had funny faces as if a child had tried to draw a cow or a moose . The British , like a man crawling out unhurt from under a car he has just wrecked , were feeling themselves all over and deciding that they were alive and that , moreover , it felt remarkably good to be alive . To an American a walk round London was as solemn and stirring as reading the Hebrew prophets . Never before had I understood the significance of Jeremiah 's curse : " And Babylon shall become heaps . " In the West End the damage is scattered ; you tell yourself that the accidents of war do n't stack up to much more than the ordinary accidents of peace . But as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Fleet Street you see ahead of you , framed between scorched stone fa ? ades that have no buildings behind them , St. Paul 's standing up oddly alone at the top of Ludgate Hill . This is the region of what people are starting to call the Second Fire of London . A whole tangled quarter of overbuilt lanes of the old City has been obliterated . In places you ca n't even find where the streets went . Stumbling over heaps of rubble , looking up at a gratehigh in a wall , or at tangled lianas of twisted steel machinery still dangling from some attic clothing shop that has lost its floor , or at the white bowl of a piece of plumbing hanging from a ledge , you begin to feel a sort of remote archaeological interest . What kinds of people were to have worn the burnt shoes piled in that pit ? Why should this brick pile be littered with small tin trays ? You rather resent the husky young fellows with pickaxes and crowbars who are risking their necks to bring these remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's surprising how many trees there are and how green and leafy they grow . Nobody ever knew there were so many trees in the City . Beyond the City the East End begins . The first thing I noticed there was that people looked better than the last time I had been in London . I had never remembered seeing before people in the East End with color in their cheeks . The sidewalks are less crowded . Most of the stale little shops are closed . Today there is neither smoke overhead nor mud underfoot . Walking through almost empty streets of the old slums which were so densely packed with people three years ago gives you an odd , ghostly feeling . There are places where avenues of flattened wreckage through block after block of jammed-together houses give you vistas to the river that no Londoner had seen for two hundred years . The lady from the Ministry who drove me down to visit one of the eastern boroughs was an anthropologist from Cambridge . We kept getting on the subject of the witch cult in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were witches or not kept getting mixed up with my questions about how the Borough carried on its branch of air-. raid protection . We started in the Town Clerk 's office . He was a slow-spoken , quiet , sandy man , a desk man all his life , you could see . Witches were nothing after what he 'd been through during the last year . He was all ready to go back to sleeping in his office if the blitzes should start up again . Last winter there had been three months when he 'd never got home . He showed us his bed behind a screen , and the alcohol stove and kettle he used to make tea with . There was a similar air of cheerful domestic bustle about every office he took me to see . Although the only protection against bombs was a few sandbags in the windows , you could feel that the Town Hall had become in the minds of the citizens an acropolis . The basement had been fixed up for the central post of the air-raid-protection service . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bombs , fires , squads in action , or equipment , could be marked with pushpins at any given moment . The Town Clerk explained the system with the confidence of a man who had helped build it up under fire . Every detail for him was full of unspoken memories and satisfactions . Things had happened last winter to build up his self-confidence ; you could see he felt now he was a man instead of a bureaucrat . Now they were all tidied up after a quiet summer , he kept explaining . " When the Jerries start up the blitz again we 'll be ready , " he said , rubbing his hands . After a little more witch talk over a cup of coffee in the Town Clerk 's office we went out into the chilly autumn sunlight and walked through the gutted streets of what had been a region of small furniture factories and cabinetmakers ' shops to a new building which contained the office that rehoused people who hadbeen bombed out of their homes . There a volunteer social worker sort of girl explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself wandering with her through a warehouse out at the back where salvaged household furnishings were huddled in forlorn groups . All the dilapidated relics of the poorer segment of Victorian society were there : brass beds , yellow oak dressers , brutally carved walnut washstands . " You see , " the girl said , " lots of people have no way of carting off their things , so they just leave them behind . We clean them up to furnish new flats with . .. . We even give them a few ornaments . " She led me into a corner packed with painted-glass oil lamps , pitcher and basin sets fancied up with Dutch girls and windmills in blue , plaster red men , framed tapestries of moonlight on the Grand Canal , plaster book ends with busts of Shakespeare , gilt and silver vases of that thin ectoplasmic glass Christmas tree ornaments arc made from . " Gruesome , are n't they ? " said the girl . " But they mean so much , particularly to the old people . " Because the people do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she explained that every effort was made to find places for bombed-out families inside the same borough . One of the great surprises of the blitz period to the people of the West End was the discovery that the people of the East End liked it there and that it annoyed them to have those grim rows of hovels called slums . They were Englishmen . These were their homes . They were not at all interested in grandiose plans for rebuilding a garden city . When the shabby houses clattered down about their ears they could imagine nothing better to hope for than to get into other lodgings as much like the old ones as possible . One of the toughest things , explained the social worker girl , about last winter 's concentrated bombings was that so many families had no sooner been settled in new quarters than they were bombed out again , and again . In the long run , in spite of trying patiently to rebuild the old life as fast as it is knocked down , people get accustomed to living in a suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a crowd , and they stop caring about their separate sacred possessions . All summer , in spite of the lull in the air raids , the wire tiers of bunks in the tube stations were full of men , women , and children who made a regular practice of sleeping there . So as the bombings go on , more and more abandoned furnishings pile up in the storage lofts of the rehousing offices . The next thing to see was the fire brigade . The big red trucks and the brawny fellows with their sleeves rolled up who were shining the brass in the engine house looked pretty normal , but it was a surprise to go through the chief 's office at the back and to find that it opened into a large room full of girls in becoming dark-blue uniforms . These were the girls who manned the emergency switchboards . They were remarkably good-looking . They had that quiet energetic look I was beginning to associate with people who had done useful work during the blitzes . They are something new in our world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in visible danger of death for days and weeks and months , and who have lived to see all the secure superstructure of their lives knocked to pieces before their eyes . It 's hard to explain just why , except that they look physically so well , but I could n't help feeling that the civilians who had lived through the bombing and burning last winter had come out of it twice the people they had been before . It was one of these pretty young girls in dark-blue slacks ( she had been a hairdresser in the old days ) who drove the fire chief 's staff car . Nobody has to be told that during an air raid the fire chief 's car has to be driven into some pretty noisy spots . The next thing on the program was the squad . They were drawn up with their truck on the brand new parking lot that the Jerries had donated to the Town Hallby blasting away a block of adjoining houses . ( The Town Clerk said dryly that the Borough had been trying to buy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't imagine he 'd have much more trouble with the owners . ) These ARP wardens are the fellows who go to work the minute a bomb falls in their area . Incendiaries they go after with sandbags , or they try to scoop them up with a long-handled shovel into a bucket of water . There 's usually a lot of tricky scampering about on roofs before they can get at them . If they can be reached in time they are not much trouble . They told me of seeing a boy scout put one out with a hag of Brussels sprouts . But when a high-explosive bomb makes a hit the old brick and rubble buildings arc reduced instantly to rubbish heaps like those on the sites of cities that have been ruined for a thousand years . The mass is shot through with wooden splinters and strange amalgams of cloth and plaster so dense that , so the ARP men said , the only way it can be moved is with the hands . Sometimes the stuff is piled in baskets and carted off that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hundreds of people have been dug out of the ruins of their houses and have had their lives saved by men digging with their bare hands . They showed me , with a certain reverence for them , the tools they had used all winter to hold off the attacks of Hitler 's most carefully perfected apparatus for destruction . There 's the stirrup pump to wet down the blaze round the fresh incendiary ; then there 's the bucket to be passed from man to man ; then there 's the Jong-handled shovel , the sandbag , and the heavy jack . That 's all . I asked about shelters . Well , they admitted that the shelters were n't much good . But they were clean and had sanitary latrines . That was better than last winter . I was taken to see a few cellars , propped up with beams , with brick partitions across the doors and windows . Protection against blast , they called it . Really efficient shelters against heavy bombs people do n't seem to care to put their minds on . Wherever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would talk freely about . II In another borough , farther east along the waterfront , on another fine afternoon , sitting in the garden of a half-ruined rectory beside the beautiful white-marble skeleton of one of Queen Anne 's parish churches , I was told the story of last winter 's shelters . The Church of England priest had lived twenty years in the East End and never had a garden before . Proudly he had showed me his cabbages and lettuce and string beans and a few puny onions . Before the blitz nobody would have imagined growing anything in the midst of this desert of masonry packed to the suffocation point with population . Now the padre 's household had quite a rustic look . They had lived off this little patch of ground all summer . Since the blitz this part of the city has been getting quiet and fresh as the country . Even in this desolate region where streets of ruincd four-storey slum dwellings stretch mile after mile , trees here and there stand up in rich green leaf growing rankly out of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters , the padre was saying , had been peculiarly difficult because , to start with , the local administration was in the hands of a crooked political machine based on floating groups of Irish Catholic longshoremen and sweated Jewish clothing workers and furniture makers . In ARP work and fire fighting the Jews had been individually magnificent , but the population as a whole lacked any sense of social responsibility . That had been the first hurdle , the sort of situation that is common in the United States but rare in England . The second hurdle had been the obtuse addiction to routine of the government at Whitehall . When the bombings began , the efforts of authority to keep its end up in the old ways ended in disaster . Only one thing MAGAZINE was ready : coffins . Everywhere there were plenty of coffins . The old Savoy Theatre on the Strand had been stacked to the ceiling with papier-mach6 coffins . The trouble was that not many people were killed or wounded , but that thousands were made homeless every night . People were terrified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old parents or their children . The result was that they crowded into a huge railroad warehouse building . Its cellars had been used as shelters during the raids in the last war . This time thousands more crowded in than the cellars could hold . They overflowed up into the upper floors where foodstuffs were stored . Latrines were improvised behind cartons of margarine . People Iaid out their blankets on the floor between streams of urine and filth . It had to be smelled , said the padre , to be believed . At least that place was n't hit . To evacuate them to the country the government collected women and children and old people in a ruinous school building . Somebody blundered . The busses supposed to carry them out of town to safety did n't arrive . That night the inevitable bomb tore the school to bits . Meanwhile , as at Dunkirk , when the authorities failed , individuals started taking things into their own hands . A couple of newspapermen and a movie director brought an old trailer down to be rigged up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car so they pushed it by hand . They proudly showed me its battered shell still standing outside the roofless church . " We can use it again if we have to , " they said . The padre , bombed out of one rectory after another , always managed to keep a kettle of soup on the fire for the destitute . Latrines were dug , flooring rigged up in the flooded cellars that had to be used as shelters . When he was n't working in the shelters the padre was in Whitehall cajoling and threatening the officials of the government . The West End had its own problems ; it kept forgetting that the East End existed . At length it was the padre 's threat to lead a delegation of five hundred women to Whitehall ( he had done it before during the rent strike ) that really got action . " When the Jerries come back , " he said , getting to his feet and swinging his long rusty-colored cassock , as he looked up into the immense lavender sky of late afternoon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose your population is more scattered now , " I said . " It 's less by several hundreds of thousands . We 'd better take you around . " Out of the little court with a tree in front of the burned-out baroque church , we turned toward the river , walking fast through the gathering dusk along empty cobblestone streets where every window was shattered , every shop boarded up , where shutters hung off their hinges and sprung doors gaped into the street . Occasionally from a corner saloon came a breath of beer and the grumble of a few sparse voices . Occasionally the rotten masonry had cracked clear across the face of a wall or a scab of rubble had dropped off , showing the crazy flooring of a room or a crumpled iron bedstead . Here and there a house had been knocked clean out of the identical row like a tooth . Here were no signs of the careful work of cleaning up that had been done in the West End . Heaps of broken glass and splintered wood and plastery rubbish still overflowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street on to a still canal with an iron bridge across it . Opposite was a row of modern apartment houses with long balconies that had an air of freshness and organized urban life about them . Some units of the group had been wiped out , but the remaining buildings looked firm and strong . Lights were beginning to come on behind oiled paper windows . Beyond was the warehouse section . " Here they really did a job . " As far as you could see down the river every dock building and warehouse had been hit . They had been of a very differenttype of construction from the workers ' hovels . All the pride and power of empire had gone into the great brick walls strengthened with blind arches of stone , the buttressed elevators , the huge blank gable ends . In almost every case they had stood up against the high explosive . Only the roofs had given way ; and the floors , where so much merchandise hauled from so many parts of the world through so many years of good business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to have seen the rats come out of them , " said the padre . " Nobody could have imagined there were so many rats in the world . You could see them scampering along the roads . " We were walking down a long straight street just back of the waterfront . As far as you could see through the dusk , no sign of life , not even a rat . After a while we came to a little old peak-roofed house that was without a scratch , tucked in on the waterfront between great scorched shells of wharf buildings . It was a pub . They told me it had been a famous hangout for slummers in the old days . This was where the West-enders came down , gingerly , to get a look at the teeming rancid life of the slums . The place was clean and tidy inside and smelled of mutton roasting . A round-faced , round-armed barmaid behind the bar . A cat asleep in front of a small iron stove . It was like being far away in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( they might have been Norwegians ) were drinking their bitter ale in silence round a table . We took ours out on the balcony that overhung the bright leaden river , brighter in this evening light than the fast darkening sky . The tide was running in , swirling in great circular ripples . A gray camouflaged freighter was tied up at the dock opposite . A patrol boat was nosing down stream . As far as you could see nothing else moved but the smudging smoke from the chimneys of a power plant . Somebody pointed out that this stillness did n't mean so much as it seemed to mean ; ships never stayed tied up at a wharf longer than the time actually needed to unload .. . But the silence throbbed in your ears . Even the gulls had gone away . As we walked back toward the rectory , through streets dark-blue and silent , with crumbled cornices like rims of canyons in a desert , we came upon a big moving van unloading men , women , children , bundles , tables , chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with gouged-out windows . " Hop pickers , " said the padre ; " they 've been doing it for generations in September . Every year they go back to the same farm in Kent when the hops are ripe . It 's their annual outing . . . . It saved a lot of lives last autumn ? so many families were away in the hop fields . But could we get them to stay away once the customary season was over ? Not a bit of it . Back they came , blitz or no blitz ? real Londoners . " HI I had seen them a few days before along the Channel coast , doing their cooking in the evening in big pots over open fires outside of the long rows of windowless shacks that would hardly be considered fit for Mexicans in California ? women with many layers of bright petticoats , sunburned children running and screaming , knotty-faced elderly men with soiled white handkerchiefs tied round their necks smoking their pipes in the doorways , all with that air of unexpressed satisfaction that belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been struck with something incredibly solid about them , as they moved round with ungainly gestures through the bright-tinted evening air which was filled with drifts of bitter sweetness by the hops roasting in the conical brick oasts that rose among the trees in every background . There 's a great power of resistance in that slow , stolid , self-reliant addiction to routine ? the resistance of tough seasoned oak . I felt it particularly when I was introduced to the mayor of a famous Channel port . The Irish senator , the Chilean journalist , and I had been walking round with a guide , looking at the very slight damage shellfire had done among the handsome old eighteenth-century seaside boarding houses , built in a crescent to emphasize the crescent of the beach , when the subject of land mines had come up . It was a beautiful pale-blue morning . The harbor in its ring of stone quays , overlooked by motionless silent cranes , was a chalky emerald color . A northeast wind ( a chilly fair-weather wind off the European coast ) ruffled streaks across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves on the shingles of the beach , where , in a gap in the web of barbed wire , some soldiers , very pink and white , were bathing . From the distance came the sputter of a motor torpedo boat that was zigzagging nervously outside the breakwater . The only other sound was the complaint of the gulls overhead . It was hard not to talk in whispers . " We had a land mine here . A proper one . They come down very gently on a parachute , you know . It took the gas works . It was our worst blitz , " said our guide . We asked to see the damage , and followed him away from the beach out on the main street and up a hill on the outskirts of the town . Several blocks round the gas works were cleared off clean . He showed us how the top had blown off the gas tank like a lid without injuring the girder work on the sides . Two rows of dwellings had gone down like card-houses . By some freak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with boarded-up windows . The Trish senator cleared his throat and said that , though he was n't drinking himself , all these ruins made his throat dry . The rest of us visiting firemen piped up that indeed we needed our bitter . " That 'll be a good way of interviewing the mayor , " said our guide . Then he told us how after the land mine the original owner of the pub , a bit shaken up it seemed , had been in a hurry to leave town . Rather than let the place close , the mayor had bought it in his daughter 's name , and finding himself with some spare time , as the town was in a military area , and many of his constituents had been forced to move inland , had taken to drawing the beer for his customers himself . We talked to him , a large beefy-faced , sandy-haired man in his sixties , as he stood in his white apron behind the bar . He and the Chilean hit it off at once on the subject of earthquakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America , where he had worked as foreman on construction projects for a British engineering firm . He had helped build the Holland Tunnel in New York . He was proud of that . He had come home to retire in the sleepy little seacoast town he had been brought up in , and now had waked up to find himself mayor of a section of the front-line trenches in the Second World War . " We feel remarkably safe ' ere , " he kept insisting . " We ' ave magnificent shelters , those old passages in the chalk ; . it 's ' ard for me to tell people to go away . ' Where 'll I be safer than ' ere ? ' they ask . We 've even ' ad to open up a school . : . they will bring the kiddies back . Now in London they 've ' ad it bad . " Of course this addiction to old custom can be carried pretty far . One Sunday evening in an Oxford college I found myself drinking port with the Fellows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we had eaten under the level painted eyes of solemn dons of the past , into a sitting room . There we took our places on chairs grimly ranked in front of the fire according to the hierarchy of the place . After the wine and biscuits had been handed round by the youngest Fellow , the aged white-haired Master started a monologue , which from the attitude of the others I suspected had perhaps been heard not infrequently before , on the subject of bird life in the Channel Islands . The only interruption was an antiphonal digression on the decline of fox hunting and the evil ways of Scotch farmers , who shoot foxes . During the whole time not a man said a word to indicate that he was aware that some strange Teutonic birds were nesting in the Channel Islands at that moment , What can you do with people like that ? No wonder Hitler chews the edges of his rugs when he thinks of them . IV Before this autumn spent in England during the odd and sunny idyll of this lull in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of top dog and underdog Englishman was so similar . It is the sort of thing a foreigner can discover only at a time like this , when you can see the structure of society stripped down , like a tenement that 's had its front peeled off by a bomb . Undoubtedly this refusal to be scared or hurried is the quality in Churchill , that erratic and brilliant topdog-by-definition , that appeals so immensely to the office workers and factory workers and farm workers in England , while to his own Tories he remains merely a lesser evil . The question is of course whether there 's enough brains and stamina left among the other toffs to hold the fort until the under-English have had time to learn the governmental knack . So far there is only one Churchill . Nobody else embodies the stolid resistance which is the rocky base of English patriotism , the fellow-feeling as islanders under siege which the toffs and underdogs share . It 's because they have this common denominator , because they can count , in all classes at a pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British are still able to walk their shattered streets as free men and to eat three meals a day and to sip a glass of bitter in the ritual quiet of their pubs , and to look with some hope toward the future . It is not only the Channel that has saved England from the fate of France . The Englishman of the lower dialect who in these days has gone farthest is Ernest Bevin . I saw him in action during the debate in the Commons on whether the Buchmanite lay teachers should be exempted are essentially a ritualistic people . Possibly for the first time in my life I felt that this ritual had its uses , when I stood under the scaffolding in a lobby of the patched-up building which , for all the picturesque work of the German bombers , still looks like a Canadian railroad station , and saw the Mace and the Speaker go by . The doffed hats , the silence , the awesome wigs , the set faces , the knee breeches and the antiquarian language ; of course they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me before that they are also a bar to retrogression . What was it but ritual that made Byzantium hold out so many centuries against the hordes and the falsehoods of Islam ? It was a pretty good day in the Commons . Sitting there alone with one other lanky sprawling American in the visitor 's gallery gave me a peculiar feeling of interloping in another age , like the Yankee in King Arthur 's court . When we were ushered into our places , questioners were heckling Captain Margesson , the Secretary of State for War ; his attitude and general manner were those of a doorman at an expensive hotel . Nobody unauthorized , you felt at once , was going to be let through into the parlors of high army policy . Other less impressive ministers followed him on to the carpet , and then the debate on the Buchrnanites drove everything else off the floor . Apparently Dr. Buchman hoped to prove that he had enough friends in high places to get his boys off from doing their ordinary citizen 's duty . An admirer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mixed feelings . It was gratifying that at such a time such a subject as exempting anybody from military service should be discussedat all . On the other hand , it was appalling that so many pompous and elderly men on the back benches should talk so much vague nonsense at a time when the continued survival of every man jack of them , and of their wives and children , was desperately at stake . When Bevin got to his feet to defend the government 's position that the lay teachers should be treated like everybody else unless they applied for special consideration as conscientious objectors , you felt right away the exhilaration of a powerful , cool , foursquare mind that methodically attacked the problem at hand . No oratory , no literature . A certain amount of the sort of heavy kidding that goes on in trade union congresses . The only thing I did n't like was his language ; I found myself wondering whether the Board Schools had n't intentionally deformed the language of generations of lower-class English , as the Chinese used to bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were in the real world instead of the Tory land of Balmy . He plugged one crazy issue after another as deftly and expeditiously as a ratcatcher plugging up holes in a loft . The minute you see the faces on the back benches you remember that the ineradicable disease of the present parliament is that the Commons was elected in November , 1935 , in the depth of the British head-in-the-sand policy . It represents the stodgiest conservative machines and the stodgiest of labor bureaucracy . It was elected to be a house of deadheads and it is . Men of brains can pretty well be counted on the fingers of two hands . Hitler 's bombers , by stirring up their time-honored background , and enforcing some tremendous transformations of locale , have caused a certain amount of activity in minds that have known nothing for years but thirdrate directors ' meetings , coupon-clipping in safe deposit vaults , and perhaps a little grouse-shooting . England has had to meet the greatest danger in its history under a government that is short on brains . The American visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks . The bar had escaped uninjured . The drinks were good , the company was good . There was very little of the self-important bustle that puts the togaed statues to shame under the colonnades on Capitol Hill . An air of frankness and relaxation . Nobody seemed surprised to see a public figure whose name some years ago was one of the hopes of liberal politics teetering , drunk to the eyes , at one end of the bar . Introductions easy and friendly . Very little side . The best club in London , I believe it has been called . Or is it that something new has happened in England that has even reached the inmost recesses of a deadhead Tory Parliament ? There has been no revolution , to be sure ; top dog is still top dog . What seems to have happened is that there has been a great deal of stimulating interpenetration of classes . In shelters , in air-raid protection work , auxiliary fire services , and in the Home Guard , men of all parts of England and of all social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked down by the blast of high explosives together . Their fraternal spirit is something that will have to be counted on . Defense organizations have learned that survival in the world we now live in demands a new kind of social efficiency . The result is no more Fascism than the Archbishop of Canterbury is the Grand Lama of Tibet . It may be something more like the New Model Army or the spirit of ' 76 . To-day , at any rate , we know that virtually every Englishman bears arms . Meanwhile the old order in its most antiquated form is still in command of most of the machinery of government and industry . How complacent the old order still is was brought home to me by a gentleman who addressed the congress of the PEN club the first morning I was in London . This gentleman , who wears many letters after his name , said he was a diplomat . His speech should have beentaken down on a stone tablet and sped to the British Museum . He expatiated largely on the fact that the inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . He ended with a sort of toast to the spirit of liberty that still burned in Buenos Aires , New York , and ( I could n't believe my ears ) Barcelona . Half the delegates were antifascist exiles , many of them had been behind barbed wire in France or Germany and had escaped shooting by the breadth of a hair . Several had started their fight against Hitler in Spain . At the name of Barcelona a shiver went through them . The only man who protested was H. G. Wells . Now it must be admitted that , like Shaw 's wise-cracks , the protests of H. G. Wells have become as much part of the English scene as Lord 's Cricket Ground . The ruling class mind of England has been , for a century at least , admirably adapted to cushion such protests , and to absorb them , and the protester too , into the system . But somehow Wells has n't quite been absorbed . He has been the schoolmaster of generation after generation of young Englishmen with brains who were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill of the Public Schools . Out of the ruin of the world he grew up in he has lived on into one of the fantastic futures he has imagined for us . It is as if Jeremiah had lived on to become a friend and dinner companion of the high Babylonians , and had seen his prophecies come true all the same . To me one of the pleasures of going to a public function in London , besides the Rowlandson oddity of people 's forms , or the Cruikshank exaggeration of their features , was seeing Wells ' spruce figure there ? his sharpclipped white mustache and the lizard alertness of glaze-blue eyes . With his immense talent , his inventiveness and keen wits , and the stream of good writing and shoddy writing that has slipped from his pen ever since I , for one , first read a book ; with his perception in the mechanical sciences and his moral fervor , he is a man who has come to embody a whole state of mind of masses of middling people , who take for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find some sort of reasonable life for itself . As Churchill embodied England 's past , it seemed to me that Wells , for better or for worse , embodied her future . I had a talk with him where he lived , in one of those great white , handsome , Palladian houses Beau Nash promoted at the edge of Regent 's Park . What we talked about was of course : will anything worth having come out of it ? Like all the young people of whatever class I 'd met who were n't toffs or aspirant toffs , he felt a great deal depended on the Russians . He thought the test for the government was whether England would really pitch in to help Stalin 's army in its fight , or whether it would settle back into the dangerous comfort of the realization of the perennial policy : that Germany must fight Russia . He had no confidence in the patriotism of the rulingclass . " They 'll probably chuck us and go saddle themselves on you . The pickings wo n't be so good over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been talking a great deal about a theory he had developed that perhaps the human race was incapable of adapting itself to its own invented world , as the dinosaurs had been incapable of adapting to changes in climate . " It 's your job and I have n't much confidence in you . . . . All we can do is to go on telling the truth whenever we can . " He was alone in the confident elegance of the Georgian hallway when I said good-night . It struck me that he was lonely . It was the loneliness of the time of life when an industrious man has all his industry so well regulated that his spare time has become somewhat empty . There 's a special loneliness too that comes at the end of the life of a man who has lived much among crowds , has been much petted by women , had many friends to talk to . I slipped out into the blackness , and felt my way down along the edge of the park toward Baker Street , smelling the autumnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird from the zoo , feeling all about me the country quiet of the blacked-out city . In the passage between the platforms down in the tube , I almost stumbled on a baby asleep in a crib . It was a plump , pink , healthy-looking baby . Beside it a man and woman were curled up together on a mattress cosily asleep under a flowered quilt , in the draft and the hissing whir of the trains and the clatter of hurrying feet . I wished Mr. Wells had seen them . None of the great saurians could have got a wink of sleep there . Maybe we arc adapting .
