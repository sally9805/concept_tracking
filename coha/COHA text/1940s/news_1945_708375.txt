txt For the personal integrity of Henry Wallace , the courage of his position on international affairs , and the broad and generous sympathies which he has displayed throughout his career , we have great respect . Surely there is a useful place for a man of such interests and such talents in this Administration . But surely the one place above all others into which Mr. Wallace does not fit is the place to which Mr. Roosevelt has now appointed him  --  the post of Secretary of Commerce  --  particularly if that post is to continue to carry with it control of the vast financial and warproduction agencies within the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries . In his letter to Secretary Jesse Jones , clearing the way for Mr. Wallace 's appointment , the President said : " This is a very difficult letter to write . " It must have been . It must have been , because it carried a callous and ungenerous notice to Mr. Jones to move out of an office in which the President himself admits that Mr. Jones has performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move out was based on one ground , and only one ground : a stated belief on the President 's part that Mr. Wallace is entitled to a reward because of what he did in the last campaign in " working for the success of the Democratic ticket . " In an extraordinary statement the President bluntly says : " It is for this reason only that I am asking you to relinquish this present post for Henry . " It is surprising to us that Mr. Wallace sl7nuld want it on these terms . Surely it o on.n. office for which he is fitted neither uy personal experience nor by the confidence of the business and financial community , of whose proper and legitimate interests he would , as Secretary of Commerce , he the special guardian . And surely , if he is to be confirmed in this office , it should be only on the understanding that he is to be confirmed as Secretary of Commerce and not as head of RFC and its affiliated activities . This newspaper originally opposed the appointment of Mr. Jones to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability of Mr. Jones , but because it seemed to us that each of the positions was a full-time job and should be so treated . It seemed to us that in this case the President was making the mistake of appointing one man to do two jobs , just as he has so often made the reverse mistake of appointing two men , or even three or four men , to do one job . Certainly , it is sound policy now to divorce the two jobs , and we welcome the move in that direction which has already been initiated in the Senate . The head of the RFC and its subsidiaries will have a more important role than any other member of the Government , the President alone excepted , in directing the tremendous post-war task of shifting from wartime control of the American economy to a peacetime restoration of free enterprise . It seems to us proper and essential that this transfer should be directed by someone with greater experience in this field and greater confidence on the part of the men who must create post-war employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
