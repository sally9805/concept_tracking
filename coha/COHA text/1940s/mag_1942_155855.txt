In every U.S. city and town , a little group of citizens got to work on a delicate , ticklish , thankless job . They were the new tire-rationing boards , serving without pay , appointed to decide who should get new tires and who should go without . <P> To get one of the 356,974 tires available this month ( normal monthly purchases : 4,000,000 ) the U.S. citizen must now beg it from his local board . He must fill out a blank as complete as an income-tax statement , proving that he is in one of the 17 essential categories ( medicos , common carriers , wholesale delivery , public service , etc. ) , that he has a tire beyond repair or retreading , that he has no spares available , no other vehicles which he could use instead . <P> Since there are not even enough tires for all who can qualify under these rules , the boards will decide which applicants are socially most useful and must get tires , which ones can be fobbed off . <P> The tire boards will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorist can buy a tire until the Far Eastern supply lines are opened . But the average man will be increasingly aware of the boards , as they take over rationing yet to come . They , or boards like them , will handle the rationing of new automobiles announced last week ( see p. 61 ) , the expected rationing of refrigerators , radios , metal furniture , many another item . <P> To most U.S. citizens , the local boards looked like the best way to handle a bad job . The citizen will present his problem to fellow townsmen who know him and his needs , the other fellow 's too . It might have been worse . If the job were handled by . a centralized faraway bureau in Washington , with decisions wrapped in red tape , it certainly would be .
