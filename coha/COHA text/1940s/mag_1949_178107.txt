The story : that General Robert E. Lee handed his sword and hat to General U.S. Grant because he took him to be the doorman . Then , with a sidelong glance at the last survivors of the G.A.R. , who had held their last encampment four weeks ago , they decided to keep meeting each year " as long as there are two of us able to meet .
