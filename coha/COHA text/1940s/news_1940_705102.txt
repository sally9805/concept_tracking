txt For the first time in weeks the weather Thursday night and yesterday defeated British bombing squadrons , Every raid planned had to be canceled . The British Meteorological Service predicted fog conditions that would prevent accurate bombing and cause much danger , both in flying and in landing . A thick mist with occasional showers and a cold northeast wind blacked out Dover Strait yesterday and last night and made the Channel choppy . Despite bad weather , which reduced operations , British bombers attacked a naval target and an aluminum works in Western Germany during the night , the Air Ministry announced today . It is reported here the Germans have suffered plane losses recently because of bad forecasts , but it is difficult to understand how any one here could confirm such reports , except the Secret Service , which is hardly likely to talk about its information . Invasion Believed Balked Authoritative sources here have indulged in some speculation and came to the conclusion that Chancellor Hitler had set Sept. 16 as the date for his invasion of England and had failed because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to this speculation there were a full harvest moon and high tides on that date . The air force was in readiness , and a fleet of barges and boats was standing by . It is now reported that troops actually embarked that clay , but then were ordered back on shore . This suggests that Sept. 15 , the day of one of the heaviest daylight attacks on England , told the tale . That was the day the British shot down 185 German planes . This loss , coupled with R. A. F. attacks on Channel ports , is believed to have caused abandonment of the invasion for the time being . A summary of the damage done in Germany by British raiders , based on information from a neutral source , was given out yesterday . According to this report , several factories in and around Berlin engaged in war production have been partly wrecked , the general postoffice in that city almost wrecked inside and some of the main gas works badly damaged . The Lehrter railroad station , a mile north of the Brandenburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned for many hours , it is stated . Damage to Railways It was also said the German railroad system had been seriously affected . One traveler from Berlin to the Rhineland reported it took him three days for the normal twelve-hour trip . Traffic on the Mitteland Canal is said to have been interrupted for five days and the east wall of the Dortmund-Ems Canal north of the old aqueduct broken by bombs . A tanker calling for gasoline and oil at Politz , near Stettin , it is stated , had to postpone its visit as no load was available . On Oct. 2 a ship loaded with grain was set afire and was still burning two days later , these accounts state . At Hamburg five ships were reported sunk in the harbor . Only three of seventy-five cranes on the quay are working , it is added . At Bitterfeld a large aluminum works had to close for several weeks and a Westphalian power station was put out of operation for some time . The Deutz automobile factory in Bremen is reported damaged by bombs , reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been burned out with the loss of all planes inside . It would not appear likely that there were many planes there , since air forces nowadays do not keep their machines huddled in hangars . Details Pieced Together LONDON , Oct. 18 ( H ) ? The British announced today that their Royal Air Force had blown a Ger- man invasion army out of its ships more than a month ago . Only the most meager details of the story of an ill-fated attempt to send a sea-borne army to these shores last Sept. 16 were given out by authoritative sources , but they ' were supported by the Air Ministry 's own news service and by piecemeal communiqu  --  s and reports that have passed the censorship on that date and since . The kernel of the story is that the British bombers , aided by a providential gale , attacked German . troopships on the French " invasion coast " just after they had been jammed from beam to beam with German troops , " and made their departure impossible by the ferocity of their attack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that the German troops , or those that survived , then were removed from the ships and the invasion plans canceled . Today 's story of the broken invasion attempt was preceded , throughout several weeks , by unconfirmed rumors from many points that the Germans had lost thousands of men  --  perhaps as many as 60,000 ? in such a disaster . For instance , the British Air Force was stated to have made a large scale assault all along the invasion coast and into Germany as far as Berlin on the night of Sept. 15-16 , sinking and damaging supply ships , hitting a German warship and blasting a tanker . Not a British plane was lost . Then the gale blew up and at dawn on Sept. 17 the R. A. F. scouts flew back to see what had happened to the invasion fleets ? " after a day of harassing bombing action and in consequence of the strong westerly wind which swept the Channel throughout the night . " " As was expected , " the communique of that date went on , " the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Today the coastal command aircraft gave escort to many large convoys of merchant vessels , and there was not a single enemy molestation by air or sea . " On the other ' land , the German communiqu ? covering Sept. 16 said there were no British air attacks on " German territory . " It was disclosed , however , that Reich Marshal Hermann Goering , head of the German air force , scouted England , especially London at the controls of a Junkers plane on Sept. 15 , and the Germans on that day shelled Dover fiercely . Dunkerque Wrecked , French Say VICHY , France , Oct. 18 ( UP ) ? A violent bombardment of the Naziheld Frenc:i port of Dunkerque by British warships has destroyed recently-built embarkation docks intended for use in loading German troops aboard ships for an invasion of the British Isles , the French press said today . The docks were said to have consisted of a chain of light platforms on which German troops were to be massed for swift boarding of a fleet of shallow-draught vessels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed the " destruction " of the seaport , which has been destroyed and rebuilt twenty times in the past five centuries . Since the German Air Force on May 21 laid ziege to Dunkerque as Allied troops fled from the Flanders trap , more than 10,000 aerial bombs have smashed upon the port and city , it was said . In one day alone 3,000 bombs fell upon it . Dunkerque is regarded as one of the likeliest of the French Channel ports to be used for any German attempt to invade the British Isles .
