txt Evidence of abuses of the cost-plusfixed fee war contracting system with War Department approval was presented to the House Military Affairs Committee today by Controller General Lindsay G. Warren in opposing legislation whereby the War Department seeks to obtain exclusive jurisdiction over contract terminations . Mr. Warren cited 270 specific instances where War Department contracting officers approved contractors ' claims which involved such items as false teeth , vitamin , pills , sanitary napkins , liquor and juke boxes . He argued that officers capable of allowing such claims to be charged to the Government as part of production costs were incapable of administering a contract termination program under which they would be " supreme " and nobody could challenge them . The War Department proposes to set up such a system under the legislation pending before the committee , Mr. Warren said . He asked that instead , the General Accounting Office , which he heads , receive specific authority to review contract terminations .

" Under them , the program would cost taxpayers " untold billions of dollars , " he added . They preclude any opportunity of detecting fraud , he asserted , adding that he believed they would be used to cover up fraud . In addition , he said , the regulations give War Department contracting officers authority to " wipe out all gains " made through renegotiation of contracts . He said that he was " amazed and astounded " at provisions which would not only " encourage collusion and fraud , " but stimulate " extreme generosity " with taxpayers ' money . Mr. Warren , a former member of Congress , directed his anger particularly at the War Department 's contracting officer to whom department regulations give final authority over contract terminations .
