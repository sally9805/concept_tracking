These are the high spots of organized U.S. Protestantism 's super-protestant new program for a just and durable peace after World War II : <P> &gt;Ultimately , " a world government of delegated powers . " <P> &gt;Complete abandonment of U.S. isolationism . <P> &gt;Strong immediate limitations on national sovereignty . <P> &gt;International control of all armies &; navies . <P> &gt; " A universal system of money ... so planned as to prevent inflation and deflation . " <P> &gt; Worldwide freedom of immigration . <P> &gt; Progressive elimination of all tariff and quota restrictions on world trade . <P> &gt; " Autonomy for all subject and colo nial peoples " ( with much better treatment for Negroes in the U.S. ) . <P> &gt; " No punitive reparations , no humiliating decrees of war guilt , no arbitrary dismemberment of nations . " <P> &gt; A " democratically controlled " international bank " to make development capital available in all parts of the world without the predatory and imperialistic aftermath so characteristic of large-scale private and governmental loans . " <P> This program was adopted last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ohio Wesleyan University by the Federal Council of Churches . Every local Protestant church in the country will now be urged to get behind the program . " As Christian citizens , " its sponsors affirmed , " we must seek to translate our beliefs into practical realities and to create a public opinion which will insure that the United States shall play its full and essential part in the creation of a moral way of international living . " <P> Among the 375 delegates who drafted the program were 15 bishops of five denominations , seven seminary heads ( including Yale , Chicago , Princeton , Colgate-Rochester ) , eight college and university presidents ( including Princeton 's Harold W. Dodds ) , practically all the ranking officials of the Federal Council and a group of well-known laymen , including John R. Mott , Irving Fisher and Harvey S. Firestone Jr . " Intellectually , " said Methodist Bishop Ivan Lee Holt of Texas , " this is the most distinguished American church gathering I have seen in 30 years of conference-going . " <P> The meeting showed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles for peace " submitted by Chairman John Foster Dulles and his inter-church Commission to Study the Bases of a Just and Durable Peace . These principles , far from putting all the onus on Germany or Japan , bade the U.S. give thought to the short sighted selfishness of its own policies after World War I , declared that the U.S. would have to turn over a new leaf if the world is to enjoy lasting peace .
