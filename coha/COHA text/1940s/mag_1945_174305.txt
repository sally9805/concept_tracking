To meet its own manpower crisis the Army is combing itself out with a heavy hand . Already most of the physically fit have been curried from headquarters offices , quartermaster depots and transportation centers . By last week there were fewer than 7,000 combat-fit ground force troops in the U.S. , and fewer than 5,000 service force troops who could qualify for battle duty . Now the Army is raking over its last fields : bases overseas . <P> The man who did much of the combing-out job is hardheaded , old ( 68 ) Major General Lorenzo Dow Gasser , veteran of the Spanish war . Gasser , serving in the Office of Civilian Defense in the early , jittery days of the war , met the civilian clamor for gas masks , fire-fighting apparatus , etc. with a hardboiled : " The military comes first . The civilians will have to get along as best they can . " Over a year and a half ago , General Gasser charged into the Army 's combing-out job , leading 14 " personnel audit " teams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were more than half a million soldiers physically qualified for combat who were serving as " overhead " troops ( administration , maintenance , communications , etc . ) . By the end of November the number had been cut almost in half . Gasser &; Co. could claim credit for 100,000 of them . All but some 10,000 men of those left were in the Air Forces , which gave up 80,000 and insisted that they needed the rest for domestic operations . <P> At one time or another every commanding officer in the U.S. begged Washington to take old man Gasser off his neck , but the high command turned a deaf ear . The war 's paramount need was for men who could fight , and they had to be dug up , no matter what it cost . In December , the cry for fighting men became more insistent . The Rhine Valley offensive had cost Eisenhower 55,000 more men than he could immediately replace . With rifle strength in many divisions cut a third to a half , Eisenhower shouted for reinforcements . The Ardennes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Marshall had to add 25,000 men to Ike 's January quota to help replace his 40,000 casualties in the Bulge . He further increased the flow of infantrymen to the theater by shipping the infantry regiments of a number of divisions still in training , in advance of their artillery regiments . Taking other measures to meet a continuing crisis , the War Department has asked Selective Service to increase draft calls to 80,000 in January and February , 100,000 from then on ; has reduced the training period from 17 to 15 weeks . <P> Gasser to Comm Z. On his hunt for new infantrymen in Europe , General Marshall 's talent-hunter Gasser will operate under the new command of Lieut . General Ben Lear ( see below ) . The Lear and Gasser hunting ground will be Major General John C. H. Lee 's behind-the-front Service Forces command , known locally as " Comm Z " ( Army slang for communications zone ) .
