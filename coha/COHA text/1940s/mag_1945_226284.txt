For 46 years Indianapolis has been experimenting with the Brotherhood of Man . It works . The experiment 's site is Planner House , * a center in which white men and black have worked together , have followed the commandment " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . " Indianapolitans believe that Planner House helped their city escape wartime racial troubles : all the explosive elements were present , but the fuse was lacking . <P> This week on Founder 's Day Flanner House will dedicate a new health center . It will also record what it has done to meet the 20th-century problems of housing , health , jobs , poverty , education , dependency . The center operates a cannery , a co-op store , a job-placement service . It trains for jobs and homemaking . Says softspoken , polished Cleo Blackburn , Planner House director and former Tuskegee teacher , " When we work at these problems , race relations take care of themselves . " <P> Formalized religion is not part of Flanner House , but religious groups share its work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Disciples of Christ contributed time and money . The United Christian Missionary Society helped . The American Friends gave $8,000 this year , hope in 1946 to give $26,000 . Said one of them : " If Friends live up to their principles there is no line of race to them . All men are brothers . Planner House offers a valuable opportunity for Friends to demonstrate the thing they claim to believe . " To which Dr. Robert M. Hopkins , president of the United Christian Missionary Society , offered as amen : " Religion is interested in better relations between men , and Planner House provides the means by which this is done . " <P> *Named for Frank W. Planner , Indianapolis undertaker.
