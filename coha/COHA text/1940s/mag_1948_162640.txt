Batista was coming back . The tough ex-sergeant who bossed Cuba through eleven years of " disciplined democracy " will run for Senator in the June 1 general elections . In Havana last week , the news caused hardly a ripple . <P> When Strong Man Fulgencio Batista 's candidate lost the presidency to hollow-eyed Ramon Grau San Martin in 1944 's free elections , Batista promptly and discreetly took a plane for Miami . Since then , backed by a jumbo-sized bank roll , he has sat out a pleasant exile in some of the New World 's toniest suites . <P> With his wife and three children , Batista now lives quietly in Daytona Beach - next door to 83-year-old automotive pioneer Ransom Eli Olds . Every morning , he is up at 7 for a brisk row in the nine-foot boat he keeps in the Halifax River . He plays tennis at the smart Daytona Beach Bath and Tennis Club , goes to the movies two or three times a week and occasionally speaks at Rotary Club luncheons . <P> Every fortnight , Batista drives off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings with aides who bring the political word from Cuba and take back his instructions . Only when the Cuban government discovers an arms cache and shouts " Batista plot " are Floridians reminded that their guest is dynamite . <P> Batista 's decision to run for Senator ( from Las Villas province ) is a hard-headed deal . His name will help the Liberal-Democrat opposition in a doubtful district . For Batista , it is a foot in the Cuban political door . Because most Cubans have forgotten his brutal police methods , remember only that meat &; butter were cheaper in his time , Batista is likely to win in a walk without so much as leaving Daytona Beach .
