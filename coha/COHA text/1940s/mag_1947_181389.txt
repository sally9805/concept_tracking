Takizo Matsumoto is a Diet member and a longtime baseball enthusiast ( ever since he was a student at Harvard 20 years ago ) . In Tokyo last week he was watching some college students practicing . The coach signaled for a bunt , but the player whacked the ball into right field . Takizo Matsumoto went up to the boy . " Did n't you see the coach calling for a bunt ? " he asked . The boy shrugged . " Sure I saw him , " he said . " But is this not a free democracy ? "
