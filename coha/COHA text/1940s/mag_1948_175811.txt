Congress had its busiest week of the session . Besides voting overwhelmingly in favor of air power , it came to grips with everything from U.N . revision to the long-range housing bill ( see Housing ) . In the Senate , Minnesota 's Joe Ball hitched up his trousers for a whirl at refurbishing the Taft-Hartley law . In the House , committeemen met behind closed doors to debate extension of the reciprocal trade agreements . <P> One strident step forward was repeal of the tax on oleomargarine ( TIME , May 10 ) . By a vote of 47 to 30 , the Senate overruled Arthur Vandenberg 's decision to send the House repeal bill to the anti-oleo Agriculture and Forestry Committee , routed it instead to the pro-oleo Finance Committee . The vote virtually assured repeal in the Senate and the end of the butter lobby 's 62-year reign .
