txt Governor ( Dewey will recommend in his annual message to the Legislature a three-point program for additional reductions of $75,000,000 in State taxes , it was announced tonight by his secretary , Paul E. Lockwood . The announcement described the program as follows : 1 . A further 25 per cent cut in the personal income tax rate , representing an additional annual saving to taxpayers of $44,000,000 . The 25 per cent cut introduced under Governor Lehman 's administration in 1942 would be continued . 2 . Elimination of the 11 , per cent emergency business franchise tax ( Article 9-A ) which became effective Nov. 1 , 1936 , thereby returning the rate to 4 / , : 2 per cent and bringing a saving of $24,000 , - 000 to taxpayers . 3 . Reduction of the unincorporated business tax from 4 to 3 per cent , effecting a saving to taxpayers of $7,000,000 . Since the existing 25 per cent cut in income tax is on a temporary basis , requiring renewal from year to year , the legislation carrying out the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with $44,000,000 representing continuation of the 25 per cent cut . All the reductions would be effective in 1946 on income earned in 1945 . The personal income tax reductions would affect 2,000,000 taxpayers . If the program is approved , as is almost certain , taxpayers will calculate their liability according to the old rate , divide by two and remit the amount shown by the division . The procedure follows the pattern set in the 1942 reduction , with the deduction now to be one-half instead of a quarter of the calculated liability . Explaining the recommended re ductions in business taxes , the first in more than a decade , Mr. Lockwood 's statement said : " Since 1936 the franchise tax paid by business in the State has been one of the highest in the nation . The $31,000,000 saving rec- ommended for business in the Governor 's program through reduction in the franchise and the unincorporated business taxes will greatly reduce the tax burden of business in New York and will have a threefold effect : " 1 . It will place the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business enterprises into our State to provide new employment and business opportunity for our citizens . " 2 . It will lead further to stimulation and expansion of industrial and manufacturing concerns both large and small already engaged in business in New York , with larger employment as the result . " 3 . It will greatly encourage the establishmikrit of small husiness enterprises needed throughout the State . It is estimated that the State now needs 100.000 new small businesses and the Governor 's program is designed to stimulate their development . " The Governor 's tax reduction program , therefore , will result in a general improvement in the standard of living of all of the people of New York State by easing tax burdens and by creating widespread new business and employment opportunities . " Mr. Lockwood 's announcement was made as the Governor was meeting Republican legislative leaders at the Executive Mansion to discuss the tax-reduction program and other proposed recommendations of his shnual message , which will be submitted to the Legislature a week from today . Official disclosure of the tax program appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the Governor 's recommendations before the public in advance of the announcement of the Democratic tax program , which is expected to be made by Paul E. Fitzpatrick , the Democratic State Chairman , in a Statewide broadcast tomorrow evening . The Governor 's proposal is expected to get warm backing from , the Republican majorities in both ' branches of the Legislature who have been under heavy pressure for sev2i'al years to widen tax relief in view of the mounting State surplus . In making the recommendations the Governor presumably took into account a yield this year of about $30,000,000 from the horse racing taxes and greater returns than expected from gasoline taxes . All horse-racing was banned as a wartime measure when the budget was submitted and it was estimated that no taxes would be collected from this source . The gasoline tax estimates were based on the assumption that wartime rationing would continue throughout the fiscal year . Instead it ended in the middle of the year . The effect of none of the recoMmended tax cuts , moreover , will be mended tax cuts will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since returns are not due until after the new fiscal year starts April 1 . The personal income and unincorporated business tax returns are due April 15 and the franchise tax returns May 15 . The reductions in personal income taxes recommended by the Governor , according to indications , will bring the yield from this source down to the level prevailing in 1929 and 1930 . There will , however , be this difference : The 1929 taxes were paid by fewer than 700 , - 000 residents of the State while the 1946 taxes will be paid by three times that numbber . Even with the recommended cut the yield from the corporation franchise taxes , on the basis used in Mr. Lockwood 's statement . will be higher than at any time before 1942 , when corporate income first reflected the effects of the defense and war programs . The 1930 yield from this tax , based on income earned in the boom year of 1929 , was only $55,500,000 . Even with the proposed cut the yield on 1945 income is estimated at $72,000,000.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
