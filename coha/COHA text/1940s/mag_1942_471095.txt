ONCE again the morning 's milk left on the doorstep is causing trouble , and the complaints of both farmer and housewife are loud and bitter throughout the land Aggravated by pressing war needs , milk prices arc higher than they have been in twenty-one years . In the year before Pearl Harbor prices were boosted five times in Los Angeles and twice in New York ; at this writing another New York raise is under consideration ; milk has risen from 11 to 14 cents in Portland , Oregon ; and it 's 17 cents a quart in Tampa . While the consumer protests these super-prices farmers insist that they are not getting enough for their milk . Wedged between these two ends ? between the cow and you ? is a huge and complicated distribution system , a system riddled ? in peace or war ? with price-fixing agreements , wasteful practices , overlapping delivery routes , extravagant promotion , and a system of Federal and State regulation so complex that regulation often defeats itself . The tangle involves also a number of labor unions who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the farmers themselves who , to protect a favored territory , bar the milk of outside dairymen . And until the outbreak of war there existed the paradox of an unmarketable abundance of milk and an under7onsumption of milk so shocking that he Federal government began subsidizig milk for school children . These are a few characteristics of the dry industry , the industry that spends big money to advertise Borden 's " Elsie " and assure you that Carnation milk comes from contented cows , the industry which presents Rudy Vallee and John Barrymore every week from coast to coast to tell the wonders of " Scaliest , " the industry that pays a king 's ransom to Bing Crosby to croon Kraft Cheese into the secret places of your heart . The business is not only big but highly concentrated . The Temporary National Economic Committee found that more than a third of all business in the dairy industry is done by four companies National Dairy Products Cor-poration , the Borden Company , Beatrice Creamery Company , and Fairmont Creamery Company . Moreover , the trend of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiveyear period in which sales of all dairy products were increasing only 12 per cent . The largest of the four , National Dairy Products , absorbed the gigantic Sheffield Farms dairies and Kraft-Phenix Cheese , the latter of which had just acquired fifty companies including the extensive Southern Dairies . National Dairy Products handles about 10 per cent of all fluid milk , 21 per cent of all ice cream , and one-third of all cheese . Borden , the next largest corporation , handles about 7 per cent of all fluid milk . In other words , a sixth of the nation 's fluid milk is handled by these two giant corporations . Half of the condensed milk is manufactured by three companies : Carnation , Pet , and White House . A fifth of the butter business is done by Swift , Armour , and Beatrice Creamery . Two-thirds of the nation 's cheese is handled by National Dairy Products , Swift , and Armour . Chiefly from these great combines come the expensive promotion and magic words that dazzle and bewilder the housewife . Will she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must decide on homogenization , pasteurization , condensation , evaporation , or irradiation . As listed on a Sheffield paper carton in New York , she must choose between Sealect sic Homogenized Vitamin D milk , Approved Vitamin D milk , Vitamin D Certified milk , Certified milk , Jersey Guernsey milk , Sealect also sic milk , Approved milk , Special Buttermilk , Regular Buttermilk , Chocolate Drink , and Modified milk . What she wants of course is a quart of uncontaminated milk at a reasonable price , but it is a struggle to get it . H Many of the woes of the industry can be traced to the workings of the " classified use " price system of paying farmers for their milk . Under it all milk is shipped from the farm as if it were to be bottled , although much is intended for the manufacture of butter , evaporated milk , and cheese . Milk used for these latter purposes is called " surplus " milk and brings the farmer a considerably lower price than does bottled milk . The handlers figure out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various purposes , at what price , and then they remit checks for the average or " blend " price for the number of gallons shipped . In practically all of the nation 's big milk areas the Federal or State government fixes the minimum price to he paid farmers for each different use under this system . The term " surplus " milk is derived from the fact that consumption of retail milk is fairly constant , whereas the manufactured milk products can be made andstored as their milk supply comes in ? chiefly during summer months when feed for cows is comparatively plentiful . The criticisms of this basic system are surrounded with controversy , but certainly consumers do not gain through its use . To send all milk to town under A-1 standards when only a part will be sold as bottled milk means excessive sanitation expense . Sanitary regulations in many localities have been embroidered and blown up until they represent a vested interest in inspection jobs and dairy equipment . In fact , this perversion of health standards has gone so far that a Federal official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every stall : the cow that gives the milk and a sacred cow which represents health regulations that one dare not criticize . " The New York Mayor 's Milk Committee investigated this matter of excessive supervision for health , among other things , and recommended a stabilized production that would sever the fluidmilk market from the manufacturedproducts market . This would " make unnecessary the uneconomic practice of producing milk for products under conditions to meet the cost of sanitary care for fluid production and the arrangements of joint marketing , " the Committee stated , after estimating that , on an average , one and a third cents a quart , or over $15,000,000 a year , is paid by New York City consumers to " support the surplus . " Falsely high standards of sanitation have even conflicted recently with the Army 's rigid standards . For example , officials trying to get daily milk for a new camp found local authorities blocking the program by requiring the use of hoods over the perfectly adequate cardboard caps . The Army finally got round this prohibitive additional cost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of health . Restrictions of this character are made even more costly by local or regional levies , barricades , and exactions . The classic instance of these is the one in which Rhode Island authorities added red coloring matter to 5,000 quarts of milk from neighboring Vermont milksheds for failure to comply with a pseudosanitary regulation concerning the routing of milk from farms . The Vermonters indignantly protested , even though some years before Vermont itself had sought to protect its own butter market by requiring all oleomargarine sold in the State to be colored pink . Another cause of trouble occurs when farmers abuse what is known as " the base surplus system " which determines the amount of milk each producer in an area shaliTsell . Because favorable prices induce extra quantities of milk , and because during several months each year there is a relative abundance of feed and milk , farmers in larger markets have for many years agreed among themselves on a base quota to be followed in future sales . If Farmer Jones produced 500 gallons of Class I milk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to market a fixed percentage of that volume in subsequent months . In lean months he may market all of his milk ; in abundant months he may market only , say , 65 per cent of it ? thus stabilizing the flow of Class I milk . All above the quota will be sold as " surplus " milk for manufactured products . The abuse comes when farmers , finding things going well , start to build regulatory fences to prevent farmers of neighboring areas from entering the field . This may be done through excessive sanitary inspection charges levied on the outside farmer or through other devices . In Washington , D. C. , a combination of the base surplus system and unreasonable " health " standards has kept milk prices on stilts . Recently there has been much consumer indignation , but so far little relief has been given to the milk customers who live within a few miles of the Department of Agriculture itself . Current hearings may stave off a further price increase but little more than a scratch will be made in the costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is distributed by dairies whose business practices are based on the extremes of not enough or of too much competition . An example of the former is New York , where Borden sells both Borden and Reid milk , and Sheffield sells both Sheffield and Breakstone milk . Until very recently the brands named after their distributors sold for a higher price . This was troublesome for the stores which had to stock four brands ; the two name brands for those who were attracted by advertising ; the two " fighting " brands which sold for a cent a quart less for those who wanted milk as cheaply as they could get it . Yet numerous surveys showed that in quality the rnilk in all four brands was substantially the same ! A few weeks ago ? perhaps in anticipation of restricted delivery service because of war conditions ? prices on these brands were levelled , but the practice illustrates the complications confronting the consumer who , after all , wants to buy ? milk . On the other hand , competition " to the point of duplicating functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dairy . The drunk who , returning home about four A.M. , sees so many milk trucks pass that he fears delirium tremens , is actually only an eye witness to the costliness of having from two to twenty or more partly filled trucks ( one for each dairy ) cover territory which a smaller number of full ones could handle adequately . Too often savings effected in one step of distribution stimulate increased costs in another . Compare , for example , the facts of store milk sales in New York and Chicago . In New York 60 per cent of all milk is sold in stores , at several cents less per quart than the price for delivered milk ; but in Chicago the milk drivers ' union blocked increased store sales for five months , knowing as Theodore Montague , President of the Borden Company , has testified ? that store sale saves labor costs of two cents a quart . In order to keep artificial jobs for its members the union refused to accede to a price differential for store deliveries . And , finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container for his morning 's milk could easily be standardized efficiently , no community is without its fight over glass bottles , waxed paper cartons , one-quart or twoquart size , and whether consumers should pay a deposit if glass is used . The whole situation is confused by the lack of desire on the industry 's part to simplify it . The question of what is to be done about it has so far been answered by local consumers ' organizations who have agitated for , and occasionally obtained , reforms ; by investigating bodies , of which the Mayor 's Committee of New York is a notable example ; and by the activity of Thurman Arnold 's Anti-Trust Division of the Department of Justice . Arnold has never attempted to indict the whole industry ; his practice has been to seek out and prosecute local and regional price-fixing and other restraints of trade . The reasoning behind this strategy is that a huge pile of local convictions will provide a pattern of abuses characteristic of the industry in general and lead to more vociferous outcries from the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some results to date . In Dubuque , Iowa , the Sanitary Milk Company decided to sell milk at the prevailing retail price of 11 cents for the first quart delivered at each doorstep , but charged only 8 cents for each additional quart a saving which would amount to $10 a year to a family which customarily bought two quarts daily . Within the first two weeks regular customers of the dairy increased their purchases of milk by 11 per cent . New customers multiplied . These two trends , however , violated a cardinal principle of the industry : Keep the margin rigid and keep all present customers somehow . In Dubuque the latter principle was enforced by an agreement between most of the dairies and the Truck Drivers ' Local No. 421 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ( AFL ) which provided a fine of $100 for any driver soliciting customers who had not been his before a specified date . What is more important , however , the distributor-union agreement required the union to enforce the retail price of 11 cents which had been fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union committee formally warned the Sanitary Milk Company that a strike would be called at its plant unless prices were raised to 11 cents straight . Arnold 's prosecution of this case ended in criminal conviction of the union and six of the principal dairies who handle about 70 per cent of Dubuque 's milk , smashing this boldest of gouging practices . In New York City , according to the indictment there , defendant dairies sold their so-called Grade A milk for two cents more per quart than their also socalled Grade B product . This might have been all right if the two grades had not been found to be substantially the same milk and if the dairies , according to the indictment , had not fixed these arbitrary prices . In brief , the charge was that they fixed prices on grades which were phony to begin with . In Chicago the indictment resulted in a consent decree in which the organized dairies , producers , and truck drivers agreed to desist from ( 1 ) fixing prices on milk corning into Chicago , ( 2 ) obstructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixing retail milk prices in Chicago . Also indicted were three of the city 's top health officials , an inspector , and officials of the Milk Dealers ' Bottle Exchange , which was said to exceed its nominal function of seeing to it that each member dairy got its bottles back . Actually , according to the indictment , the organization was an agent for enforcing the industry 's restrictive practices ; the health officials , acting in concert with the industry , gave preferential treatment to producers selling milk at the fixed prices by imposing heavy burdens on producers who refused to sell their milk in accordance with the agreement , and refused to inspect farms of those producers who failed to play ball ? even though some of these farms were near dairy farms which were approved . Arnold has just been asked to act in Cincinnati , where producers and distributors work under a Federal Marketing Agreement under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture . Starting at 11 cents in September , 1940 , prices climbed a cent at a time until they reached 15 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made under the theory that Federal Agreements provide for only a minimum price ? that it is all right to go above the minimum . But if producers and distributors get together to raise the specified minimum , all theory aside , the effect is a plain conspiracy to raise prices . Double suspicion was aroused in Cincinnati by the fact that the farmer 's return during this period jumped only 2.3 cents per quart ( from 5.3 to 7.6 ) , while distributors picked up four cents . The government became interested in knowing what happened to the other 1.7 cents when the Cincinnati Post reported on January 24th of this year that a local grocer who had refused to fall in line with the last price increase , and thus had increased his sales 35 per cent almost overnight , was finally forced to conform to the agreed price . The distributor from whom he buys milk warned that no more supplies would be forth-. coming ? unless ! With this evidence on his desk , Secretary Claude Wickard could do little but suspend the Cincinnati Agreement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force no longer carries out the purposes of the . . Act of 1937 under which it was issued . " The Secretary 's masterpiece of understatement prefaced what has since become an official reexamination of the entire regulatory system . By getting together under color of a Congressional Act , producers and distributors appear to think themselvesimmune from anti-trust prosecution ; but it has been known for some time that Arnold has been waiting for just such interests to hang themselves with rope furnished , perhaps unwittingly , by the Department of Agriculture . By suspending the Cincinnati Agreement Wickard is serving much-needed notice that he may not protect such abuses much longer . Indictments against the big cheese makers have already been handed up , and perhaps the butter producers will feel Arnold 's sting soon . But one of the most striking acts to date of Arnold 's economist , Corwin Edwards , who heads the food drive , is an indictment against the Evaporated Milk Association , whose members produce over 85 per cent of the country 's evaporated milk . This industry , which distributes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates under a Federal Marketing Agreement ? a legalized price-fixing arrangement which dates from the fabulous NRA code days . One of those named in the indictment is Dan F. Stilling , the Managing Agent of the Marketing Agreement , whose appointment was approved by Henry A. Wallace while Secretary of Agriculture . The chief objection is to price fixing , but some housewives would regard as more reprehensible the paragraph which sets the size of a can of evaporated milk for popular use at 1434 ounces instead of some sensible size . IV If the milk industry is to survive as a strictly private enterprise it must take many constructive steps . To reduce costs of distributing the present volume we need only an attack on familiar problems and the extension of proved experiments ? such as waxed paper cartons . Discrimination of any kind on paper cartons must be slapped down as it appears , though of course paper should replace glass only where it proves to be cheaper . There is no excuse for opposing paper containers with a sanitation argument as long as they are manufactured under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containers were ordered by State authorities to charge one cent more for their milk than for that in glass bottles . The reason claimed for this was a wish to maintain stability in the market . Obviously , the sponsors of paper wanted no such concession as a higher price ? they wanted only to beat glass in open competition . After court proceedings , paper cartons won and they are now doing very well . New York is only one of the jurisdictions which at first fought paper but now enjoys the savings which it brings . Regardless of what the container is made of , consumers have a right to demand either extra-sized bottles ( halfgallon or gallon ) at a saving per quart , or a reduced price for each quart delivered after the first . A third saving on containers is possible if every customer has to pay a deposit on his bottles . The average milk bottle costs five cents and lasts for only 35 trips to your door . However , studies show that the number of trips may vary from 6 to 91 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another economy will come from the abolition of hoods over cardboard caps . How many areas have authorities who sincerely require such frills or dealers who find their customers attracted by the elegance is not known , but dairymen in Charleston , West Virginia , recently estimated that hoods would cost them $75 , - 000 a year . The hood is not a sanitary essential and the simplest ones cost a fourth of a cent apiece . Fortunately the War Production Board will probably order the discontinuance of the gadgets ? or at least of those which use wire ? as a conservation measure . Perhaps the most substantial savings can be wrung out of the rambling delivery route system ? both from farm to dealer and from dealer to consumer . If the shortage of tires causes WPB to order milk deliveries to be made no more often than every other day , as much as 1 ; 4'cents a quart might be saved . Also an exhaustive study of the Milwaukee milk market , made more than four years ago by the Department of Agriculture , shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found that if all of the 25 distributors ' 831 trucks could have been used at 100 per cent capacity , instead of the customary 60 per cent , only 494 trucks would have been necessary ? a saving of 337 . On the multiplicity of routes the study showed that there were , on an average , 5.8 duplications of trucks in each city block . By use of a unified delivery system , operated as a single franchise or by the municipality , it was estimated that almost 10,000 miles daily72 per cent of the competitors ' total route mileage ? could be saved . In New Zealand excessive duplication of routes has been eliminated by zoning the market area , but private competition was retained . Thus no dairy sends its trucks all over the city partly full ; each dairy confines its route to a zone in which its trucks are full most of the time and compete with only part of those in the city . Daily dating of milk is another unnecessary service . Started merely to attract customers to snappier service , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas ? notably New York City . The folly of adding cost to a quart of milk just for the sake of dating it may be illustrated by the fact that fresh milk shipped regularly from New York City is still sweet when it arrives in the Canal Zone five days laser ? and no consumers there look for the date ! A price differential between truck deliveries and store purchases is the sign of a freely competitive market . Government officials know that any city in which store milk is not cheaper than delivered milk is being gouged , yet even now in Chicago the union has set its wage scale for delivering milk to retail stores so much higher than the scale for delivering to homes that the price of store milk is nearly prohibitive . Equally indefensible is the practice of keeping would-be producers out of a given market by means of jacked-up health standards . For more than eighteen years the U. S. Public Health Service has been urging the universal adoption of uniform , sensible milk-sanitation standards , but less than one-third of the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington , D. C. , market the Federal Marketing Order allows dealers to charge one cent per quart more because Washington 's standards are so much higher than those of adjoining areas . Last year , when Washington consumers argued that prices could be reduced by allowing neighboring farmers to enter the market , producers viciously defended their outmoded , costly ritual . A Public Health Service expert , testifying officially , pointed out that District of Columbia inspectors deduct two points if farmers fail to wipe the udders of each cow with individual towels , 12 points unless live steam is used for sterilizing equipment , and one point if a horse stable abuts the cow barn in any way . These 15 points , not required by strict Federal authorities , have helped to keep excellent milk out of Washington for years . The way to real savings in milk distribution cost has been pointed by buying co-operatives . In the District of Columbia a loosely organized group of this kind arranges with one of the dairies to deliver milk to its members at a reduced price in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenbelt , Maryland , housewives have been more militant , with even more success . There they sit down periodically with the competing dairies , tell the distributors what price they 'll pay for milk during the next contract period , and get the milk at that price . If the above-outlined steps prove impossible or ineffective , the industry will find remaining alternatives less kindly . There are a number of authorities in high positions who think that the industry could logically be socialized ? that milk is a natural monopoly like water , elec .. tricity , telephone , and mail . And there arc some who think the industry should be socialized . The predominant opinion is that there is a great frontier to explore somewhere between the present $3,000,000,000 confusion and government ownership . Even the more conservative authorities do n't mind saying ? usually off the record ? that it 's a good idea to hold over the industry the threat of municipal ownership . One such expert said ; " I dislike the thought of socialization , but I know very well that all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant ? saving the expense of maintaining all the others . " Another , who dislikes socialism even more , admits that milk is as much a public utility and necessity as electricity , for which he favors public ownership . In any event many distribution economies will be forced into practice by the rigors of a wartime economy . Now is the time , the more farsighted authorities say , to plan for making those economies permanent . By way of chopping the price of milk down enough to bring it within reach of persons not now able to afford it , the government has shown in a dozen cities that low-income families will come after milk if the fineries of individual service are laid aside . In Boston , New York , Chicago , St. Louis , New Orleans , and the District of Columbia about 200,000 quarts of milk a day are sold to more than 450,000 needy persons through special depots set up by welfare authorities . The Department of Agriculture pays producers a subsidy of about two and two-thirds cents a quart on this milk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quart less for the milk , and dairies bid competitively for the concession ; but the amount of subsidy is not of paramount importance . What is important is the fact that the total subsidy plus the nickel a quart which customers pay on an average is less than the prevailing price of milk in most of those areas . In Boston , where the program was initiated ( in August , 1939 ) , relief clients pay 6 cents a quart , the distributor gets 2.11 cents from the Department of Agriculture , and the farmer takes one cent less for his milk ? making a total of 9.11 cents which it costs to distribute the 54,000 quarts daily through 100 welfare depots scattered around the city . In the same city the prevailing wholesale price , comparable to the 9.11 figure , is 12.5 cents , while the retail price is 14 cents in stores . True , WPA personnel is used in clerical capacities and the depots are furnished by the city ; but it should also be noted that out of his 2.11 cents the distributor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , while no phenomenal savings have been demonstrated , it has been shown that the market is there and can he reached . The other Federal program brings milk in a similar way to school children only , at a cost to them of one cent a glass . Now operating in a dozen cities , this program has proved so beneficial that it is being expanded even during the war period . Whether such programs will bring about a change in the industry 's price policy remains a question , but the many small economies should be the very first order of business . As one harried housewife expressed it : " If the dairies would worry less about their contented cows and give more thought to having contented customers , they 'd get along better . " Members of the industry have a choice : They can clean up the mess themselves or let the government do it . Milk is too important to be fumbled forever .                    @
