Most U.S. military observers had thought that the Reds would crush Chiang Kai-shek 's forces at Suchow , and take his capital , Nanking , in a matter of days . When this did not happen last week , they could hardly believe it . <P> Chiang held nothing back from the Suchow battle . He concentrated his armies east of the city , relying on the fall floods to defend the swampy plain to the north and northwest . He guessed right . The Reds concentrated their attack on the east , and Chiang 's men were there to meet the assault of 400,000 Communist troops in one of the greatest battles of China 's history . <P> Chiang 's air force , which has scored no previous spectacular success , stopped the Reds . Cloudless days &; nights with a full moon helped his flyers play havoc with the Red supply lines . <P> After twelve days of bitter fighting , both sides were in precarious positions . One of Chiang 's armies had been cut off , and two others that tried to rescue it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liu Po-cheng were trying to reinforce their badly mauled forces ; the Communist supply lines from the north were long , and open to air attack in coverless terrain . <P> If Chiang had won anything at Suchow , it was only a breather . The plight of the Nationalists was still desperate , both on the Suchow front and in the north . Chiang had , however , proved against expectations that there was still plenty of fight left in his army . Whether that spirit would be enough to save China from going Communist depended on how much help it got from the U.S. <P> China 's Communists , well aware of the danger to them of increased U.S. aid to Chiang , blustered and threatened . " If the American government should dispatch its armed forces , whether for all-out or partial protection of the Kuomintang government , this would constitute armed aggression against . . . China ... All the consequences thereof would have to be borne by the American government . " <P> Meanwhile in Washington , U.S. officials studied a report which recommended what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to China as investigator for the Senate Appropriations Committee . After a hardworking month of travel and talk with Chinese on all levels , he came back with a program based on these points : " Immediate and extensive " direct military aid , combat advisory aid , financial aid for military operations , financial aid to stabilize the currency , and strict U.S. supervision of the distribution of U.S. money and supplies . Clark 's conclusions : " Piecemeal aid will no longer save failing China from Communism . It is now an all-out program or none ; a fish-or-cut-bait proposition . "
