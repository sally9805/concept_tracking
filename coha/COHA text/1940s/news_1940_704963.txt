txt Viscount Halifax , British Foreign Minister , disclosed in the House of Lords today that an agreement " in principle " had already been reached with the United States Government on the leasing of British Western Hemisphere air and naval bases . LONDON , Aug. 20 ( JP ) ? Britain has decided to offer the United States 99-year leases on air and naval defense bases in its western ihemisphere possessions , Prime Minister Winston Churchill told the House of Commons today . In his eighth war statement , one filled with cold confidence , the Prime Minister declared Britain had decided to offer these " suitable sites " to the United States in Newfoundland and the West Indies , and was not asking for any advantage in return . However , he did appeal for " timely reinforcement " of Britain 's Navy from the United States  --  apparently a reference to some 50 over-age American destroyers which Britain wants to buy . His appeal was made to " our friends across the ocean " to send Britain the warships which will " bridge the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1941 . " As Mr. Churchill spoke three great waves of German planes thundered across the channel into Southeast England and dropped their bombs , then roared back to France . Ready to Act Now Of the proffer of ckefense bases to America , Mr. Churchill asserted Britain was ready to open discussions for their development whenever President Roosevelt was ready . " Naturally , " he added , " no transfer of sovereignty is involved . " Undoubtedly this process means that these two great organizations of the English-speaking democracies , the British Empire and the United States , will have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage , " he declared . " For my own part , looking out upon the future , I do not view the process with any misgivings . " I could not stop it if I wished . No one can stop it . Like the Mississippi , it just keeps rolling along . Let it roll ( cheers ) , let it roll on fullflood , inexorable , irresistible , benignant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commons that " far larger operations are impending in the Middle East " and declared that invasion of Britain becomes " much more difficult week by week . " Scorns Nazi Blockade The Prime Minister , dismissing Germany 's proclaimed " total blockade " of England , declared bluntly , that no food would be allowed to reach any country which has fallen to Herr Hitler . He said he regretted that he had to refuse American requests that food be allowed to go to the people of France , Belgium , and Holland . He conceded that " the enemy are still far more numerous in the air than we , " but declared that British plane production now exceeds Germany 's , " largely . " " We are sure of ourselves and our cause , " said the Prime Minister , and he declared that , with control of the seas and the friendship of the United States , Britain can " draw resources from the whole world . " Two or three years mean nothing in the life of a Nation , he told the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rough or smooth , we mean to reach our journey 's end . " " Hitler is now sprawled over Europe . Our offensive springs are being slowly compressed , and we must resolutely and methodically prepare ourselves for the campaigns of 1941 and 1942 . " And when we are doing the finest thing in the world , and have the honor to be the sole champion of the liberty of all Europe , we must not grudge these years , or weary as we toil and struggle through them . " Then , somberly , he reviewed this summer 's " cataract of disaster , " warned that " the puppet Government " of France may be forced to become Britain 's foe " at any moment " and declared that all the ports " from the North Cape to the Spanish frontier " might be used to attempt an invasion of Britain . Yet , he said , immense amounts of munitions from the United States had been landed in England " without the loss of a gun or a round " of ammunition , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventu- ally would get superiority in the air . Continuation of Other War This was the first official word of the safe arival in England ? of supplies of surplus American Army munitions valued at $37 , - 000,000 which the Administration released nearly three months ago . Over shipping routes kept secret , World War artillery , rifles , machine guns , and ammunition have been moving to England since they were turned over to the British Government when the Allied armies were defeated in France . The munitions included 600. - 000 Lee-Enfield rifles , more than 500 World War 75-millimeter field guns , a large number of machine guns and an undisclosed amount of ammunition . Calling the present war " only a continuation of the last " ? despite great differences in its character , Mr. Churchill said the earlier conflict of millions of men against masses of steel had been replaced by a combat of strategy , organization of technical apparatus , mechanics and morale . British casualties in the first year of the World War amounted to 365 , - 000 , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , British killed , wounded , prisoners , and missing , including civilians , are about 92,000 , but of these a large proportion are alive as prisoners of war . " Nevertheless , Mr. Churchill said . " consequences to the belligerents have been even more deadly . We have seen great countries with powerful armies dashed out of coherent existence in a few weeks . Effects of Struggle " Although up to the present the loss of life has been mercifully diminished , the decisions reached in the course of , the struggle are even more profound upon the fate of nations than anything which has happened since barbaric times . " Among his listeners in the diplomatic gallery were United States Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy and Soviet Ambassador Ivan Mai-sky . Loud cheers greeted Mr. Churchill 's announcement that Britain will maintain " a strict blockade of Germany , Italy , France , and every other country that has fallen into the hands of Germany . " We must refuse to allow food to be passed through the blockade , " he declared . Blockade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strict blockade not only of Germany , but of Italy , France and all other countries that have fallen into the German power , " Mr. Churchill said . " I read in the papers that Herr Hitler has also proclaimed a strict blockade of the British Islands . " No one can complain of that . " I remember the Kaiser doing it in the last war . " What indeed would be a matter of general complaint would be if we were to prolong the agony of all Europe by allowing food to go in to nourish the Nazis and aid their war effort , or to allow food to go in to the subjugated peoples which would certainly be pillaged off them by their Nazi conquerors . Turns Down Requests " There have been many proposals , founded on the highest motives , that food should be allowed to pass the blockade for the relief of these populations . " I regret that we must refuse these requests . " The Nazis are boasting that they have created a new unified economy in Europe . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they can feed their captive peoples . " In a German broadcast of June 27 it was said that while Mr. Hoover 's plan for relieving France , Belgium , and Holland deserved commendation , the German forces had already taken the necessary steps . " We know that in Norway , when the German troops went in , there Were food supplies to last for a year . Supplies in Poland " We know that Poland , though not a rich country , usually pro-1 duced sufficient food for her people . " Moreover , the other countries which Herr Hitler has invaded all held considerable stock when the Germans entered and are themselves very substantial food producers . " If all this food is not available now it can only be because it has been removed to feed the people of Germany and to give them increased rations there during the last few months . " At this season of the year , and for some months to come , there is the least chance of scarcity , as the harvest has just been gathered in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most valuable ' foods are essential to the manufacture of vital war materials . Fats are used to make explosives , potatoes to make the alcohol for motor spirit . The plastic materials now so largely used for aircraft construction are made of milk . " If the Germans use these commodities to help them bomb our women and children , rather than to feed the populations who produce them , we may be sure that any imported food would go the same way , directly or indirectly , or be employed to relieve the enemy of the responsibilities he has assumed . Hitler 's Responsibility " Let Hitler bear his responsibilities to the full , and let the peoples of Europe who groan beneath his yoke aid in every way the coming of the day when it will be broken . " Meanwhile we can arrange in advance for the speedy entry of food into any part of the enslaved area , when this part has been wholly cleared of German forces and has genuinely regained its freedom . " We shall do our best to encourage the building up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there will always be held out before the eyes of the peoples of Europe , including ? I say it deliberately  --  the German and Austrian peoples , the certainty that the shattering of the Nazi power will bring to them all immediate food , freedom and peace . " New style war , he said , seems to be " well suited to the genius and the resource of the British Nation and Empire " and " once we get properly equipped and properly started a war of this kind will be more favorable to us than the somber mass slaughters of the Somme . . . . " Friendship of U. S. Command of the sea and " the friendship of the United States , " he added , " enables us to draw resources from the whole world . " " As in Nelson 's day , the maxim holds : Our first line of defense is the enemy 's ports . ' " And , he said , " we have never had armies like this in our Island in time of war . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " Lauding Britain 's airmen , Mr. Churchill said " never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few . " British bombing squadrons , Mr Churchill said , were inflicting " shattering blows upon the whole technical and warmaking structure of the Nazi power . Catching Up in the Air As " solid grounds " for his confidence , Mr. Churchill said the Germans still had " far more " planes than Britain " but our new production " is greatly faster . Although " American production is only just beginning to flow in , " British " bomber and fighter strength despite the battle is larger than ever . " He anticipated still greater Nazi air warfare with confidence in Erithin 's ability to meet it . " We hope and believe that we shall be able to continue the air struggle indefinitely and as long as the enemy pleases and the longer it continues the more rapid will be our approach , first toward parity and then toward that superiority in the air upon which in a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill continued . " We have mastered the magnetic mine . . . . " The navy is far stronger than at the beginning of the war . . . . " Meanwhile , Dominions Secretary Viscount Caldecote told the House of Lords that Britain had lost since Aug. 8 94 fighter pilots and 153 fighter planes as against Germany 's loss of 699 bombers and fighters . Merchant tonnage under the British flag , Mr. Churchill de-glared , " is larger than when we began " " The whole British Army is at home . More than 2,000,000 determined men have rifles and bayonets in their hands , and three quarters of them are in regular military formations . " Blow to Nazi Bases " Even if the Nazi legions stood triumphant ' on the Black Sea or , indeed , upon the Caspian , even it Hitler was at the gates of India , " he said , " it would benefit him nothing if at the same time the entire economic and scientific apparatus of German war power lay shattered and pulverized at home . " Noting Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countries , Mr. Churchill said " it is quite plain Hitler could not admit defeat in his air attack on Britain without most serious injury . " Mr. Churchill claimed for Britain " overflowing reserves of every type of aircraft and an over mounting stream of production " because of " the astounding increase " in output and repair under Lord Bea verbrook , Minister of Aircraft Production . Turning to Italy 's African drive , Mr. Churchill said the French defection had been " deeply damaging " in. the defense of British Somaliland , now in Italian hands . France might have fought on , he said , declaring : " If we had been put in the terrible position of France , now happily impossible , it would have been the duty of all war leaders to fight on here to the end : It would have also been their duty to provide as far as possible for the naval security of Canada and our Dominions and to make sure that they had the means to carry on the struggle beyond the oceans . . . . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great and noble nation , " he said , pledging that . " our old comradeship with France is not at an end . " The day will come as surely aE the sun will rise tomorrow , " ne said , when again there will be " a France restored in a liberated Europe to its full freedom and ancient fame . " Besides Frenchmen still fighting with Britain , he said , Czechs ,
