The sense least understood ( not counting humor ) is the sense of smell . Its subtleties baffle scientists and enrich perfume compounders . Last week Yale 's Drs . Lloyd H Beck and Walter R. Miles , after long and thoughtful scratching of their scientific noses , presented the National Academy of Sciences with a brand-new theory . The nose , they said , is not , as commonly believed , a laboratory which identifies odors by chemical analysis . More likely , its smeller is an instrument or measuring infra-red ( heat ) rays absorbed by odorous vapors . <P> It has long been known that many gases and vapors transparent to visible light absorb certain wavelengths of infra-red This fact is used industrially in identifying gases ; chemists shoot infra-red rays through a vapor and note what wavelengths are absorbed , and how strongly . Why , reasoned Beck &; Miles , should the human nose not do the same ? <P> Body Broadcasts . They collected data on vapors and discovered that all those studied which have odors can absorb certain bands of infra-red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without odors do not absorb these wave lengths . Since the human body at normal temperature radiates heat waves chiefly m the 7-14 band , it looked as if the ability to absorb heat waves on the " body 's broadcast frequency " is what makes vapors smellable . <P> But how does the nose do the smelling ? The " smell receptors , " patches of specialized cells in the upper nose , lie across air passages from tissues which are normally cooler than they are . Therefore the cells radiate heat waves across the air stream . Beck &; Miles theorized that when pure air is passing through the nostrils , the cells give no signal ; they are getting rid of their heat at the standard rate . But when an odorous vapor is present in the air stream it absorbs certain wavelengths of the heat which the cells are radiating . The cells can feel the change and the stimulus produces a sensation of smell . <P> Cockroach Teaser . To check the theory Beck &; Miles started with cockroaches , which wear their smellers conveniently on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloves vapor ( attractive to cockroaches ) behind a gas-tight window of material transparent to infrared . The cockroaches responded to it just about as strongly as if the barrier were not there . When a thin sheet of glass ( opaque to infrared ) was added to the barrier , the cockroaches showed no more interest in the window than when there was no oil of cloves behind it . <P> Next , the two Yale researchers tried bees , which have much more complex reactions . The bees acted like the cockroaches , crawling frustrated outside a heat-transparent window with sweet-smelling honey vapor behind it . Apparently both cockroaches and bees could smell vapors at a distance from their antennae . This may explain how certain creatures , such as male moths seeking their females , seem able to detect odors far downwind . <P> Vapor Blends . Human beings are harder to test . Their smelling apparatus is deeply buried in the upper nasal passages , where it can not be blocked off from the vapors by heat-transparent barriers . Beck &; Miles hope to lick this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavelength of fragrances .
