LETTERS OF MARCEL PROUST ( 462 pp. ) - Translated and edited by Mina Curtiss-Random House ( $5 ) . <P> In the last 17 years of his life , Marcel Proust spent the greater part of his waking time ransacking his memory and writing down what he found with mingled love and horror . When he died in 1922 , he left a mountain of legends about himself-of the fabulous invalid who nearly always wrote in bed , with his manuscript propped on his knees ; of the Paris room whose walls were lined with cork to deaden all sound of the world outside . Besides his monumental Remembrance of Things <P> Past , he also left a voluminous correspondence . Now , after more than a quarter of a century , Mina Curtiss ' selection of his letters ( which the onetime Smith College associate professor has translated herself ) makes most of them available in English for the first time . <P> Dreyfus Echoes . At first glance , the letters seem only the posturings of a dilettante , but this impression soon wears off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an effete youth to a sharp observer of the tragedy in life , from a superficially clever snob to a mordant analyst and remorseless judge of snobbery . <P> In one of the earliest , probably written when he was only 15 , * Proust practices the mincing tones of flattery : " Madame , you are pretty , extremely pretty . " He signed a note to one creature : " The most respectful servant of your Sovereign Indifference . " He feigned passion , and strained for it , but could seldom find it . Later he was to admit that " I only know how to tell women I admire and love them when I feel neither one nor the other . " Perhaps he remembered the letter he had written to a Creole courtesan , a friend of his great-uncle : " I should far rather make a slip with you than be on the right side even with the whole Academy-and Anatole France would , too . Indeed , it would be delightful to make a slip with you . " His passion for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> But even the life of a wealthy , pampered dandy could not go undisturbed . Proust 's father , a successful physician , was a Catholic ; his mother , whom he adored and whose image dominated his life , was Jewish . When Marcel was 23 , the Dreyfus affair split France , and the young man instinctively rushed to the defense of the Jewish captain . In one of the few political acts of his life , Proust circulated petitions for Dreyfus ' release . The echoes of the affair rang in his novel years later ; after the bigoted behavior of his aristocratic Parisian friends , Proust could never write long about " society " without bitterness . <P> Behavior Quirks . From childhood , when he discovered that by feigning illness he could avoid parental discipline , Proust had suffered from asthma . The illness was , he knew , at least partly " a nervous habit , " and though it struck him severely through most of his adult life , he refused to submit to thoroughgoing treatment . Instead , he isolated himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aroused to literary ambitions , he found himself " weary of insincerity and friendship , which are almost the same thing .
