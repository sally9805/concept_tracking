Along West Madison Street , within sight of the handsome Daily News skyscraper , sprawls the noisome slum of saloons , hash-joints , missions and flophouses that Chicago calls Skid Row . One morning last June , as he picked his way to work through Skid Row 's reeking garbage and broken bottles , and stepped past the bodies of sleeping derelicts on the sidewalks , Daily News Managing Editor Everett C. Norlander felt his stomach turn over . His next reaction was that he was walking through a good story . When he got to his office , he called in two young rewrite men and asked : " How would you like to be bums for a while ? " What Norlander wanted was an inside story of Skid Row to shock Chicago 's complacent citizens into cleaning up the shame of their city . <P> For the assignment he had picked graduates of tough schools . Husky Bill Mooney , 30 , an ex-tail gunner who was shot down over Germany , had been trained on the police beat of Chicago 's rough &; ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So had Fred Bird , 28 , a Pacific combat pilot . They left the city room and were swallowed up by Skid Row . <P> Days On . Last week , the Daily News jolted Chicagoans with a spread of Hogarth-like pictures and the Mooney-Bird story of their 14 days in the land of " the living dead . " In the twelve-part series , Reporters Mooney and Bird described the worst of 82 squalid saloons in three-quarters of a Madison Street mile ( most of them selling the " morning special , " a double shot of whisky for 18 ) , listed the names &; addresses of saloonkeepers who were breaking the state liquor and health laws , and put the finger on couldn't-care-less cops . <P> <P> The reporters took their readers on a guided tour of 46 flophouses , where 12,413 bums slept in lousy cubicles for 50 or 60 a night . They watched hard-faced jackrollers stripping the pockets and stealing the shoes from sodden bums , saw prostitutes plying their trade amid the lumber piles and back alleys , found that " a surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , executives or professional men . " <P> Nights Off . Tough as they were , Mooney and Bird soon found that Skid Row was tougher . One time Mooney got violently ill having a sociable drink of beer and wine , and had to quit for the day . After one night in a bug-infested hotel , the two reporters gave up , slipped home of nights to their own beds . <P> Nobody on the Daily News except Norlander and City Editor Clem Lane knew what had happened to the two rewrite men . One sharp-eyed staffer , who asked Lane about Bird , was told that he was working on a special story . Said the staffer : " The hell he is . I just saw him sitting on a curb on Skid Row . Boy , what a bender he must be on ! "
