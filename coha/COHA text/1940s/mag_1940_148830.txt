When Edward Hull Crump was mayor of Memphis 30 years ago , he clinched his grip on Memphis ' heartstrings by refusing to enforce State Prohibition . During World War I , when the Army demanded abolition of the red-light district , the trulls quietly packed up and moved their business to shuttered houses on South Main Street , Vance Avenue , Mulberry Street and thereabouts . In the ' 305-third decade of his reign-Ed Crump continued to let Memphis go its primrose way . Memphis was sinful , all right , but it was never loud and raw about it . Memphis was the kind of town where the rich , old Second Presbyterian Church could transact its godly business within bottle 's throw of a brothel , a saloon , a gambling joint and the Negroes ' steamy Beale Street . <P> Last week Memphis had the cold-water blues . Gone from hotel lobbies were the expectant blondes . Brothels were closed ; their staffs had fled . Bookies had shut up shop . Even bingo was outlawed . Tourist-camp proprietors conspicuously took the numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hirelings were fired , one because he had lived for years with a leading madam . A police sergeant on the vice squad was suspended , although he was a son-in-law of the chief of police . <P> Author of these Memphis blues was Ed Crump 's new Police and Fire Commissioner Joe Boyle . Joe Boyle is pious , thorough , as independent as a hog on Mr. Crump 's ice can be . " Boyle on the neck , " his policemen call him . " Holy Joe . " under-worldlings snort . " We are just enforcing the law , " snaps Joe Boyle . <P> Astounded Memphians looked around for other reasons . Silvery Ed Crump is aging ( 64 ) , weary , saddened by the recent deaths of his mother and one of his sons , anxious to be remembered as the good boss of a good town . Shriners , and American Newspaper Guildsmen ( whom Mr. Crump testily invited to stay away ) , are to convene in Memphis this summer ; the Boss presumably would rather bore the delegates than have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cleanup was to drive gamblers to nearby De Soto County , Miss . Tall , smooth Bob Berryman trekked to De Soto , opened the Paddock ( dining , dancing , gambling ) . A rival house was the Shanty . Memphis newspapers reported the Paddock gambling ; the De Soto sheriff said he had never heard of it . Last fortnight the Shanty was raided and closed ; the Paddock was not bothered . Word went about that Bob Berryman had talked with the sheriff , but the sheriff denied it . A second-string gambler and gorilla named John Phillips blustered that Bob Berryman was trying to be tsar of gaming in Memphis and environs . One night last week Bob Berryman chased John Phillips into a Memphis cafe , felled him with three shotgun charges and four bullets from a snub-nosed Colt . " It was over the night clubs down in Mississippi . " moaned dying John Phillips . Holy Joe 's policemen arrested Bob Berryman , charged him with murder . There was still life in Memphis , and the wages thereof .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
