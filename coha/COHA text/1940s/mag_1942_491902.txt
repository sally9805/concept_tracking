T HEY say that when the gamblers first wan- dered into Madison Square Garden to look into the financial possibilities of this here basketball , " they forgot to make book on the game itself . One glimpse of Referee Pat Kennedy in motion , and the wise-money boys were offering odds that the " red-faced mug out there wo n't be around for the finish . " Now , basketball referees seldom make the sports headlines . It would be difficult to name another field in which men labor in the constant rays of the spotlight and still live in anonymity . Performers in a thankless job , beset by belligerents on every front , they are born to bellow unsung , if not unseen . There 's just one exception . He 's Pat Kennedy . By general consent , Matthew ( Pat ) Kennedy , of Hoboken , New Jersey , is the best basketball referee in the business . But ability itself would not be enough to set him apart . What really gives Kennedy his lien on fame is that he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whistle . He is probably the only sports official , save Jack Dempsey , who 's been headlined as a double feature with the principals in a sports contest . Kennedy , in full cry , is a phenomenon of unrestrained sound and fury . He crouches , he leaps , he blusters , he threatens to blow a fuse every time he works . No foul is too trivial to catapult Kennedy into his version of the Big Apple , Charleston , Black Bottom and Lindy Hop , all wrapped into one . The punishment he inflicts on himself is appalling . No one knows what contortion or gyration Pat will produce at any given time . Neither does Pat . Take the night a well-known Southern team madeits first appearance in New York . One of its players inadvertently committed a foul . Kennedy , apparently in terrific rage , descended upon the youth , tooting his whistle louder than six policemen in a traffic snarl , his index finger stuck in the offender 's eye , his voice booming , " You , you , you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one and all , Pat wrapped his arm around his neck until it seemed he would strangle himself as he demonstrated the holding foul . The bewildered youth stammered , " I beg pardon , sir . Honest , I did n't mean it . " Not all players are as awed by the latest Kennedy histrionics . Take the time he came up with his illustration of a charging offense . There were five blasts of Pat 's whistle , as his anguished voice ricocheted from the ceiling 's girders , " No , no , no ! You ca n't do that ! " In the same instant he had his hands on his midriff and was hopping forward , his head and body working back and forth in simulation of a duck roll . The defendant , a North Carolina lad , shouted to his mates , " Hey , get a load of this guy ! He looks like an auctioneer at a crazy man 's sale ! " Keeping an Indian Good p AT 'S pride was wounded on the occasion of Stanford 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hank " traveling , " or running with the ball . The inevitable whistle cut through the arena . Pat 's face reddened to a hot-dog color . " You , you , you  --  you took too many steps ! " he ranted over and over again , rolling his fists like a taffy puller , his legs dancing up and down  --  a perfect demonstration of the violation and a Navaho war dance thrown in . Luisetti placed his hands on his hips and laughed so hard the Indians had to call for time out . Frank Serany , Duquesne player , once struck a blow for all Kennedy-bedeviled players . Serany was nabbed in the act of hacking . A bellow seared everybody in the vicinity . Pat , the veins in his neck bulging like cords , his eyes popping , pranced up and down , cracking his right arm down on his left forearm in a seemingly desperate effort to break it . " Number Thirteen ! On the arm ! Number Five shoots ! Two shots ! " The pale and somewhat shaken Serany turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pat , is n't it bad enough that you scare the daylights out of a guy when you call a foul ? Do you have to crucify him before the whole crowd ? " To which Kennedy replied , " My boy , the more you err the louder I yell . " The Eastern Intercollegiate League , for whom Pat has done considerable work during his fifteen years of whistle tooting , once suggested that Pat cut out the act .. The emissary from executive headquarters took Kennedy aside and gently suggested that the games could be refereed without so much calisthenics . It really took up so much time . Besides , he added , the customers did n't pay to see the referee perform . Pat , a. hired hand , tried to please his employers . But he was n't the same . It was like cutting off a man 's legs and asking him to do a tight-rope walk . One day he told a friend , " To hell with this kind of stuff . I got ta do it my way or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . I 'm through crampin ' my style . " Clair Bee , famed Long Island University coach , sympathized with Pat . Bee says , " Pat could n't help himself if he wanted to . The moment that guy gets out there he 's part of the action . He never has to think on a decision . That 's why his reaction is physical , not mental . " Pat 's decision to go back to his act was generally popular . Whatever collegiate officials may think , the fans love the Jersey jumping jack . Basketball scribes contend that in every gathering there are those who do n't know a backboard from a left guard , but who come to see Kennedy . The night he collapsed after a collision with a player and was carried from the floor with a twisted ankle , the crowd rose and gave him a cheer loud enough for a Luisetti . It was a strange thing to happen to a referee . His job is the world to Kennedy . He works harder than any two players on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , his shirt looks as if it had just come from the washtub . Frequently between halves he makes a complete change of clothing . He drops ( Continued on Page 43 ) . ( Contioued from Page 17 ) anywhere from five to ten pounds a game  --  which he promptly repairs with several mugs of lager . Big basketball games are handled by two officials . That 's no help to our palpitant Pat . He often acts as if he were handling the game alone . Nick Kearns , of Chicago , assigned to a game with Pat several years ago , was fresh as the immortal daisy at the game 's end . " You did n't need me out there with that guy , " he said ; " I just came for the trip . " During the season Pat 's weekly schedule comprises six nightly college games . Sundays he usually works a professional game in the afternoon and another at night . Besides , he toils as a physical-education teacher in David E. Rue Junior High School in Hoboken . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 125 games , covered 25,000 miles , and shed close to fifteen pounds from his five-footeleven-inch frame . He made his high run of concentrated whistle tooting two years ago . He began in Convention Hall , Philadelphia , with Temple-West Virginia ; jumped to Annapolis for a matinee Army-Navy engagement ; returned to the University of Pennsylvania 's Palestra to handle Penn-Columbia ; darted to New York for a Cleveland-bound plane and a pair of pro tests , flew back and was blowing his whistle for Yale and Dartmouth at New Haven  --  all in four days . No matter what the obstacles may be , he never fails to arrive . Stranded one night in a snowstorm , with fifteen minutes till train time and not a taxi in sight , Pat placed himself squarely in ! the path of an approaching auto , determined that it would pass only over his mangled remains . As the car halted , Pat pulled open the door , to be met by a terrified young woman . " Stop yowling. " he commanded , throwing his luggage into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the referee . Got to make a train . Let 's go . " I Once , in order to be on time , he changed clothes in an auto that was forced to crawl because of a frozen windshield . Another time , lie squirmed into uniform in the baggage car of a delayed train and was on the court two minutes before game time . " I 'll never forget it . First I 'd run in and put on a shoe . Then I 'd run out to see if we were moving . Then I 'd run back and put on my shirt . Then I 'd come back and see what time it was . I threatened the engineer and the conductor . Once sign a contract , I got ta get there . " The demand for his services has been unabated for about a half dozen years , which is something of a record . Basket , ball officials enjoy cycles of popularity . Johnny Murray , Dave Tobey , Frank Brennan , Dave Walsh and Frank Hill had their years of full programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat has worked in more than 2000 games with comparatively little trouble . Players long ago realized that Kennedy not only knew his business but was absolutely honest and would take no nonsense . Pat piously says , " When I went into this game I made up my mind that Pat Kennedy would call ' em as he saw ' em . No matter what happened , Kennedy was going to stick by his guns and his judgment . " " Poison " Joe Brennan , of Brooklyn Visitations , found that out in a professional game against Paterson . Brennan , as his prefix implies , was one of the tough men of the pro circuit , besides being one of the great stars of his time . When Kennedy called a foul on him , Brennan started for Pat with obvious malice aforethought . Pat stepped back and waved the terror from the court . Whereupon it was necessary for Brennan 's mates to hold him in check . The big boy , letting invectives fall where they might , was for dismembering our hero . Baptism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't leaving the floor . Kennedy , roaring so all could hear , announced , " This game ai n't goin ' any further until you get off ! " Manager Donlon , of Brooklyn , and Manager Wagner , of Paterson , pleaded with Pat . The crowd had paid its dough . It was dangerous to call off the game . The Brooklyn team began walking off the court . Pat stood his ground . For fifteen minutes the tumult continued . Finally , Brennan gave way . He went out of the game . " Was I in hot water after that ! " chuckles Pat . Pat was twenty when the American League , the major pro loop , signed him . He was the youngest referee in the circuit , and that maiden year gave him a taste of how tough a referee 's job can be . He had two close calls within days of each other . Both involved Fort Wayne , a belligerent band of basketeers led by scrappy Bob Miller . Fort Wayne was in a battle with the Cleveland Rosenbiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Windy City . Miller disputed almost every verdict . Kennedy threw him out . Fort Wayne lost . The following night Fort Wayne was to meet the Cleveland five in Fort Wayne . When Pat arrived in town , he found sports pages telling of the expulsion in scareheads . The minute Pat came out on the court , he was in for it . The crowd booed . The players griped with extra enthusiasm . Fort Wayne lost by three points and decided to take it out on Pat . The Cleveland players , among them such notables as Pete Barry , Johnny Beckman , Joe Lapchick and Dutch Dehnert , merged into a human tank and swept Kennedy from the floor . Even so , a spectator tried to take a poke at Pat . Pat ducked and the blow raised a mouse under Barry 's eye . Three hours Pat sat in the dressing room awaiting the all-clear signal . Shortly afterward , Fort Wayne came to Trenton . Fort Wayne had Rusty Saunders , a Trenton lad and a pepper pot . All night he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crowd would roar ; when he called one against Saunders , they also roared . Late in the fray , Saunders threw some punches at Kennedy . Pat ejected him , amid catcalls . When he called two fouls on Trenton in the last twenty seconds , which Benny Borgmann , Fort Wayne ace , made good with baskets , for a victory , Pat knew his time was at hand . Protected by the police , Pat managed to gain the dressing room . He had just taken his first good breath when in rushed Tom Barlow , the Trenton leader . Barlow had two sets of boxing gloves in his hands . He blared , " Come on , squirt ! You and me is going to have a little get-together ! Of all the ! X ! ! Z ? officiating I ever saw ! " He got no further . The cops heaved out Barlow , came hack and put Kennedy in a taxi . Stones rattled on the cab 's windows and Pat reached the station safely only because the cops escorted him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But once in a while they lose their tempers too . This happens when they are losing , or when the star player is fouling his way out of the ball game . The usual crack to Kennedy then is , " Come on , cut out the acting and referee the game . " At which Kennedy 's face wrinkles up . his lips curl , his nostrils sniff as he gets off his favorite bon mot , " O.K. , son . Mr. Kennedy will cut out his actin ' if you 'll cut out your Poulin ' . " Coaches do n't get much chance to argue with Kennedy . Pat steers clear of them before games , during halves and after . " They all cool off after a good night 's sleep , " is his motto . Doc Carlson , of Pittsburgh , did go after Pat , though , a couple of years ago . It happened in Philadelphia , when Pitt and Temple were playing for a conference title  --  the conference has since passed away . Pitt was doing a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul calling . With each penalty the moans and groans from the Pitt bench grew louder . Carlson was in fine voice . Halfway through the first half , Pat called a foul . Ten or twelve Pitt- sweaters came hurtling onto the floor . Pat called a technical foul and threatened to clear the bench . Carlson was on his feet protesting that Kennedy was calling penalties before the infractions had been committed . ' And , dammit , you 're interpreting the block wrong , Kennedy ! " stormed Carlson , Kennedy patiently explained his interpretation , to no avail . Then , his face the color of ketchup , he thundered , " Listen , you mugs ! I 'm just as human as you are , and I 'm going to call this game my way ! I 'm the boss , see , and I 'm running the show , and I 'm not going to be made a monkey out of before twelve thousand people ! " Carbon tried to explain , but Kennedy had already given him his heels . When the half ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation . But Pat would have none of it . He virtually slammed the door in Carlson 's face . The second half was played in comparative peace . " And I was calling just as many , " Pat relates . Carbon took Pat to the station , they shook hands , and to this ? day are friends . " The best , " says Pat . If Pat senses trouble , he agrees with the official paired with him that they will clamp down on funny stuff from the very beginning . In a recent N. Y. U.-Fordham game , for example , the players started off by paying too much attention to one another . Instead of a basketball game , a battle royal was in prospect . Pat and Dave Walsh -- who , incidentally , started him on his career  --  called thirteen fouls in ten minutes . Whereupon the Rams and Violets got the idea that they were n't going to get away with any rough stuff , and settled down to an interesting game . Martial Music Only once in Pat 's career has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened five years ago in the Garden , when L. I. U. and Manhattan College met . It was the kind of game in which , says Pat , " you had to be on top of the ball every inch of the way . You could n't lose a step . " From the opening minute there was trouble . Intracity rivals , the lads were exchanging verbal harpoons every time they could spare the breath . Several times Kennedy threatened to start a parade . " I 'll march you guys out one at a time if you keep this up , " he warned . He thought he had things in his hip pocket when , five minutes before the end , the punches began flying . No one knows who started it . Before Kennedy could put out the fire , he heard a terrific thud from the opposite end of the arena , " like the whole shebang was coming apart . " When he turned in the direction from which the noise had come , he grew pale . The Manhattan band had dropped its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was advancing en masse on the battle scene . What is best remembered about that little frolic is the picture of Mr. Kennedy , his arms flailing the air , hopping around like a madman , blowing his whistle at the musicians . That whistle once caused Pat a trying moment . It was during a Temple-West Virginia game in Philadelphia . He blew so hard he blew the side of the whistle from its moorings . The thing went dead , of course , and there was Pat calling a foul with no tooter . " Lucky for me , " says he , " my motions automatically stopped play . " Once in a great while Pat misses one . He admits it . There was quite a furor several years ago in his own bailiwick after a decision he had rendered in a school game . Citizens of Hoboken would n't talk to citizens of Union City . The incident came just at the end of a game between Demarest and Union Hill . As the game ended , Union Hill connected for a goat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1ff . In so doing , Kennedy disregarded a disagreement between the two youngsters who were holding the watch as to whether the ball was in the air before ( Continued on Page 46 ) 46 THE SRTURDRY EVENING POST January 24,1942 once ( Continued from Page 44 ) or after time was up . He apparently did n't trust the kids and set the verdict . The local paper went after him with plenty of ink and some pointed comment on the rules . When it was pointed out to Pat the interpretation of the rule was that if there is a disagreement between the timers the goal must count unless the referee has knowledge that would alter the ruling , Pat reversed his decision and the game went into the records as an 18-18 tie . Then , to show that there were no hard feelings , he cut short a vacation to volunteer his services for a Red Cross benefit carnival wtich was being sponsored by the paper that had blasted him . " Heck , " Kennedy exploded , when praised for his action , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to these kids about sportsmanship , ai n't I ? " Pat was born on January 28 , 1908 . From that first dawn , Pop Kennedy recalls , Pat was endowed with a husky pair of lungs . It would be nice to report , too , that Pat was born with a whistle in his mouth . But that would n't be the truth . The whistle did n't come until Pat was five . Uncle Bill , a Hoboken cop , gave it to him . Pat started practicing immediately , to the constant distress of all within earshot . When the kids on Third and Madison streets played cops and robbers , Pat always was the cop  --  because he liked to blow the whistle . When Pat was eight or nine , his father , then a superintendent on the Delaware , Lackawanna coal docks , began taking the boy to athletic events . Sports and Pat thenceforth were happily wedded for life . He caught on his high-school baseball team because " that position gave me more of a chance for action . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played center and forward in basketball . How to be a Referee But whether it was the call of the whistle or not , the fact remains that what Pat liked to do most was to referee the intramural basketball games . Dave Walsh , who coached baseball and basketball at the school , remembers that Pat seemed cut out for refereeing . " I never saw a kid who could handle a game the way Pat did . He was fast , efficient and thorough . He seemed to get a tremendous pleasure out of the work . And he never seemed to tire ; he could play in one game and officiate in three others the same day . " Walsh , already an established court official in the metropolitan area , took the lad under his wing . He laid down the maxims which have since guided Kennedy : " Be prompt and decisive in your judgment . Know the rules . Keep in shape . Do n't linger after games . Always be a gentleman . " Pat carried Walsh 's bag for him on different assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basketball game , with Walsh or without , there was Pat , studying the game , situations , styles of play , learning how the rules applied . Many were the nights when Pop Kennedy would catch him sneaking in . Pat would then hear how no good would come of him if he kept on hanging around gymnasiums and did n't study . Many were the times when Mom Kennedy saved Pat from something more than a tongue-lashing . At Panzer College , a physical-education school , Pat had a brief athletic career . He had begun officiat ing in local club games and it took all his spare time . His first professional offer came from the Bankers League , of New York , for whom be worked at three dollars a game . The Hoboken City League raised him to seven dollars , and the Hudson County loop gave him fifteen dollars . Then came the offer from the American League , and Pat was making twenty-five dollars . When the American Olympic Committee chose him in 1936 for the final tournament , he received $150 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hotel accommodations paid . Nat Holman , C. C. N. Y. 's famous coach , and one of the great basketball players of all time , got Pat his first college assignment  --  the game between C. C. N. Y. and Rutgers at the New York school 's gymnasium . On December 29 , 1934 , when Ned Irish promoted his initial doubleheader in the Garden , Pat was there for the St. John's-Westminster tilt . He 's been a fixture there ever since . J ? Nightmare Game Pat eats and breathes basketball . He even sleeps it , as Corky Corriston found out one night . The two of them had been working in a championship tournament in New Jersey and roomed together . When the competition was over , they went to a party at their hotel which lasted to the early hours of the following morning . Dog-weary , they finally retired . Thirty minutes later , friends in near-by rooms heard a terrific thud and clatter from the Kennedy-Corriston nest . Rushing into the room , they found Corriston sprawled on the floor  --  knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his noggin . Kennedy still was sleeping , but it was n't very peaceful slumber . For , witnesses attest , Pat was churning the air with his arms and legs and calling single and double fouls . One reporter of the incident insists that it was n't until Kennedy called two fouls on George Washington for crossing the Delaware that they awakened him . Pat trains for his job as hard as any athlete . Six weeks before the season begins he spends four days a week in the gymnasium . He arrives there after his high-school classes and for two hours plays handball or runs around the track , tapering off with a half hour in the pool . He goes home for dinner and , after a bit of relaxation , returns to the gymnasium , where he concentrates on arm and leg calisthenics , bending and stretching . His legs are as hard as a plaster cast . Good enough , Kennedy boasts , for a dozen seasons more . When the basketball wars are over , Pat moves into another sport . He umpires college baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like Bill Klern . I got the voice , have n't I ? " Pat made the first step toward realizing that dream in mid-August last season , when he signed a contract with the Inter-State League , a Class B outfit . " In five weeks I did n't hear a boo , " Pat beams . He did so well he was assigned to the play-offs . But , on the last day of the campaign , a screeching line drive caught him on the ankle and he was out of commission . Socially , Pat 's a convivial chap ; he is a good dancer  --  he once went to the finals of a local competition  --  has a fair singing voice , which he uses to warble Irish melodies . Something of a Beau Brummell , his wardrobe contains twenty suits , blues , browns and grays ; 300 ties on the conservative side , and an uncounted number of shirts , mostly white . Beer is the strongest beverage Pat drinks . Six in a row is his limit . And after four he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting stewed . " Between refereeing and umpiring , he manages to squeeze in golf . His score hovers in the 120 's , but he 's " improving , " he insists . Fishing is making a strong bid also . Always a scoffer at the rod-and-reel addicts because he thought there was n't enough action , Pat was coaxed aboard a deep-sea , charter-fishing boat as a guest recently . Once the sword and sailfish began biting , it was hard to get him off . One of Pat 's vices is spending money . He 's forever picking up checks , regardless of the size . It is not generally known , because Pat does n't talk about it , but he 's held the bag on loans for as much as $500 . Walsh , who has been counselor as well as teacher , says , " That 's really the only trouble I ever found with the boy . He 's too soft a touch . " Pat 's never too busy to contribute his services for charity . There are several big benefit events at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for his success with players , he says , is that " I show them respect on their kicks . I explain things ' to them . I also know that a ref has to be able to take it . But he should take just so much . As long as a player does n't try to make a monkey out of me , I hold my temper . Once he doesbing ! Out he goes ! " As for basketball and the fire horses they put into it these days , Pat has no complaint . He would like to see the center jump returned for the last three minutes of a game . This he recommends because as it is now , he 's convinced , a trailing team is penalized when , after scoring a goal , it must yield the ball . But as far as Pat 's concerned , they can rewrite the rule book every six months , so long as they leave inviolate Rule 6 , Section 13 . This begins , " The Official shall blow a whistle ?
