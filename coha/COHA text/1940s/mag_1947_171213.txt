It used to be mother &; father who read to the kids . Now any parent with a phonograph in his home and money in his pocket can have the reading done for him by a professional . There were never so many children 's records to choose from . Among the new standouts : Danny Kaye 's version of a children 's favorite , Tubby the Tuba ( Decca ) ; a new volume in Capitol 's Bozo the Clown series ; Peter Lind Hayes ' Genie , the Magic Record ( Decca ) ; Sterling Holloway 's Uncle Remus Stories ( Decca ) ; The Little Engine That Could ( Victor ) ; Dinah Shore 's Bongo ( Columbia ) . Older kids can hear Lionel Barrymore 's reading of Dickens ' A Christmas Carol ( MGM ) or shiver to Basil Rathbone 's Oliver Twist ( Columbia ) . <P> Music for the grownups : <P> Bach : Cantata No. 140 ( RCA Victor Chorale and Orchestra with soloists , Robert Shaw conducting ; Victor , 8 sides ) . Young Robert Shaw gives Bach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recording : fair . <P> Khachaturian : Violin Concerto ( Louis Kaufman , violinist , with the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra , Jacques Rachmilovich conducting ; Concert Hall Society , 8 sides ) . This concerto , a favorite in Soviet Russia , won its composer his first Stalin Prize ( 1940 ) . It is full of furious fiddling , signifying nothing . Performance : good . <P> Wagner : Tristan und Isolde , Love Duet ( Helen Traubel , soprano ; Torsten Ralf , tenor ; Herta Glaz , contralto , with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra , Fritz Busch conducting ; Columbia , 4 sides ) . Traubel &; Ralf take the famed love duet faster than Flagstad and Melchior . The result is surprisingly warmer , and the orchestral setting is fuller . Recording : good .
