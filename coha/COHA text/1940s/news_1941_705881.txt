txt The tentative report of a Senate interstate commerce subcommittee recommending endorsement - by Congress of a Western Union-Postal Telegraph merger is the outgrowth of hearings held last May when Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission James L. Fly urged that Congress authorize a merger of the two companies to prevent the possibility of the industry 's " total disappearance as an independent entity . " At the same " hearings R. B. White , Then president of Western Union , and Edwin F. Chinlund , president of Postal Telegraph , also advocated consolidation to make possible better and more economical service Among arguments for the merger at the hearings were : Western Union and Postal duplicate the effort and facilities of one another in most cases ; Postal normally incurs a deficit and the long-term trend is against Western Union , although it is currently a profitable company and expanding its earnings substantially over recent years ; great savings to security holders and to the public would result from a merger planned in advance , while losses might result if one is forced through the liquidation of Postal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of the two companies seem to agree on these points , labor groups involved are inclined to be hesitant , on the grounds that a combination would displace several thousand employes . Chairman Fly has proposed that they he combined into a single new company , without holding companies . which would purchase the property of the existing firms through transfer of stocks or bonds in the new corporation . Any such arrangement would have to be worked out between the two companies , with the approval of the FCC . Actually there have been several proposals before the subcommittee . One involves just the merger of the two domestic telegraph companies . Another would also take in the telegraph apparatus of American Telephone &; Telegraph . Western Union 's plant had a 1940 book worth ( its land lines less depreciation ) 5235 million . Its cables property is valued at $8 million additional . Postal Telegraph property , involving only land lines , is valued currently on the books at $41,300,000.                  @ @ @
