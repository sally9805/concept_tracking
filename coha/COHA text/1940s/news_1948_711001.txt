F.A.T.X.11.111-E of M.E.A.MER.S1=1-3P When we pause to reckon how completely world reconstruction depends on a wise distribution of food supply , and how gravely Europe 's own share in her recovery will be jeopardized if her people do not have enough food to maintain the strength to produce , then the breakdown of our voluntary food cpaservation program in this country must be a source of great concern . The Government itself had long since abandoned the poultryless day , and admits that the pledge from poultrymen on which it so acted has not been fully honored . Now eggless Thursday has also been dropped for " seasonal " reasons . About all that is left of the voluntary program , the meatless Tuesdays , had already been scuttled by general noncompliance , and some restaurant and hotel associations have told members that it would be " impractical " for a few establishments to continue the voluntary program when it was being ignored widely throughout the country . Reports from other major cities confirm that the program , initiated with much enthusiasm from Washington only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on Oct. 5 in a radio speech to the nation that President Truman said that " an essential requirement of lasting peace in the world is the restoration of the countries of Western Europe as free , self-supporting democracies . * " They must do most of the ' job themselves . They can not do it if thousands of their people starve . " Secretary Marshall on that same evening supported this appeal by the President in saying that " food is a vital factor in our foreign policy , " that the attitude of Americans toward food " can make or break our efforts to achieve peace and security throughout the world . " What President Truman and Secretary Marshall said in early October is as true now as it was then . But the Administration in Washington must substantially share the blame if the voluntary food saving program has increasingly lost popular support . For it has failed itself to provide the continuing leadership to make that program work . Since Charles Luckman resigned in late November as chairman of the Citizens Food Committee virtually no appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning on price inflation . The fact is that many housewives have forgotten there is such a thing as a meatless Tuesday . The public has to be told continuously and eloquently of the need for food saving and what is to be done . with the food saved by American abstention . It has not been so told . The Administration has apparently felt that a two-month job of " selling " the program would be all that was necessary . If so , it made a colossal misappraisal of human nature . The Marshall long-term aid plan , which will now be under discussion in Congress , assumes a level of production in Europe that will strain every hu. , man resource in those countries taking part . They will not be able to hold up . their end of the bargain unless they are reasonably well fed . It is essential that our Government resume its responsibility of leadership if . the foodsaving program is not to degenerate completely into a farce of nonobservance.               @ @ @ @ @ @
