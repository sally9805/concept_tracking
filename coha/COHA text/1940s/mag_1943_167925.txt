One day a couple of months ago a wiry , bristly man with large ears and a happy Irish face strode into the editorial offices of the New York Sun and asked for a job . The Sun 's executives snapped the applicant up . He was mnemonic John Kieran , for 16 years sports columnist for the New York Times , for four and a half years a Shakespeare quoter , birdlore expert , Latin scholar , jingle singer and general know-it-all of Information , Please . <P> Last week the Sun announced smugly : " . . . exciting news for New Yorkers . . . John Kieran is coming . . . . His daily column ' One Small Voice ' will be limited only by the scope and fertility of the Kieran mind . ... " The fertile Kieran mind had sprouted the seed which has been observed in other sportswriters , notably Heywood Broun and Westbrook Pegler-the desire to break away from the confinements of sports columning , to reach into the grab bag of memory , to write about anything and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob ) Davis , the evening Sun 's columnist who roamed the globe and wrote what he pleased . Bob Davis ' death three months ago left a gap in the Sun 's pages which Kieran felt he could fill . <P> Money was no factor in his decision to change , even though the Sun will probably pay less than the approximate $12,000 a year he has made on the Times , for Kieran makes a reputed $500 a week from Information , Please . He has also earned fame out of his Information , Please broadcasts , but the aloof Times has always looked down its nose at such programs and considered it an upstart in the field of information . <P> <P> Kieran 's own formal explanation of why he quit the Times : what with newspapering and pleasing with information ( not counting increasingly frequent , nonprofitable radio appearances selling war bonds , etc. ) he has been much too busy to do the traveling to sports events his Times job required . Sports fans had noticed his columns getting more erudite and less sporty . Whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will write only five for the Stm , and will be able to do them at home , sending his copy to the Sun office and to the Bell Syndicate , which will distribute the new column nationally . <P> Times readers found out about Kieran 's departure only indirectly-when Sports Writer Arthur Daley began authoring Kieran 's " Sports of the Times " column . Even then readers may have failed to notice the difference , because Daley 's first effort was extremely Kieranesque . In a discussion of the Oregon State and New York City College basketball teams , both called " Beavers , " Columnist Daley referred to an Oregon beaver as Castor Ore-goniensis and to a City College beaver as Castor Nova Eboracensis.
