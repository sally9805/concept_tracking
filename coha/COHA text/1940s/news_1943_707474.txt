txt The controversy between Secretary Morgenthau and the Senate Finance Committee , regarding the latter 's proposed amendments to the law governing renegotiation of Government contracts , raises a whole series of issues ? economic , administrative , legal and technical  --  which it would be difficult to disentangle in any short space . We are more likely to find our way through these thorny problems by putting aside for the moment the particular points of difference between Mr. Morgenthau and the committee and looking at the broad principles involved . The present provisions for renegotiating war contracts were adopted for reasons that are not difficult to understand . Firms were asked by the Government to make products that they had never made before  --  in some cases , indeed , products that had never been made before . The scale of production of these products has been beyond any previously known . It was impossible for the Government , in letting these contracts , to know what these war weapons and accessories would cost to produce . It was often impossible for the companies themselves to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed immediately . It was of the first importance that the goods be produced without delay . The Government negotiators , therefore forced to act half blindly , wanted to protect the Government ? from being forced to pay excessive prices , and wanted to protect themselves from the accusation of letting contracts that would allow excessive profits . The result was the legal provisions permitting them to renegotiate contracts where it was apparent that excessive profits were being made . * * * But this was not the whole of the problem . The renegotiation of contracts , even if we assume it to have been done most conscientiously by the Government 's agents , raises very grave questions of equity and of governmental procedure . The Government contracts may be renegotiated if profits are " excessive . " But there is no definition to guide the Government 's agents concerning what constitutes " excessive " profits . Moreover , the Government officials charged with the responsibility for renegotiating assert that no such definition or standard is either desirable or possible . If a company were permitted only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were permitted to make a maximum of 10 per cent above its costs , then , once such a rate of profit were passed , there would be no further monetary incentive for the company to make economies in production . The result , Government officials agree , might be a great deal of waste that could cost the Government far more than any savings it effected by renegotiation , not to speak of accompanying wastes of materials and manpower . The Government renegotiators contend , moreover , that many other factors besides rate of profit must be taken into consideration  --  among them the general performance of the corporation in handling a contract and the efficiency or lack of it with which its operations have been conducted . But if the Government does not or can not apply a fixed standard of excessive profits , then we confront difficulties of another kind . In that case , a different standard , depending on the decision of the Government negotiators , is applied to each company . This is certain to raise suspicions and provoke charges of discrimination or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by Companies who feel themselves aggrieved . The renegotiation proceedings may , indeed , be regarded as the equivalent of a special excess profits tax in addition to the excess profits tax explicitly provided for by law . But this additional excess profits tax is of a peculiar nature . The basis for imposition is not fixed . The rate of the tax is not fixed . The taxpayer , in fact , not only can not compute in advance what the tax will be ; he does not even know whether he will be asked to pay the tax or not . The j tax , moreover , is fixed in private negotiations . The taxpayer may not , know precisely what standards have beer . applied even after the assessment against him has been announced . However honorably and conscientiously the Government agents may act in this matter , in short , the renegotiation proceedings provide opportunities for favoritism , caprice and arbitrariness that ought not to exist in a democratic government , Commenting upon a statement of Under-Secretary Forrestal that in the first year 's operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator George recently said : " Is it voluntarily , when the Government officials can determine what is a reasonable profit or an unreasonable or an excessive profit , without regard to any standard , and when the Government officials can bring in a contractor and say to him , ' You know what power we have . You sit over there and say how much of this money you can give back to us . ' " The renegotiation provisions also present grave administrative problems . The Truman Committee estimated that there would be 85,000 cases to be renegotiated pursuant to the law . It was recently stated that 9,000 settlements will be made this year . At such a rate it would take nearly ten years to renegotiate the war contracts . Joseph 14 , Dodge , chairman of the War Department Price Adjustment Board , declared recently that war contracts subject to renegotiation do not exceed 20,000 . But even this lower figure is a formidable one . The departments themselves have admitted the seriousness of the problem by asking that the exemptions from renegotiation be raised from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $500,000 . But even Mr. Dodge does not expect this higher exemption to reduce the case load by more than 20 per cent . Obviously , further reduction in the number of contracts subject to renegotiation is necessary . It will greatly complicate the problem of returning to peacetime economy if large numbers of corporations find themselves at the close of the war subject to a rebate of undetermined and indeterminable amount to the Federal Government , * * That renegotiation has resulted in savings to the Government is clear , though spokesmen for the War and Navy Departments have given the impression that-these savings , on net balance , are much greater than they are . UnderSecretary Patterson declared recently that " price adjustment operations to date have resulted in saving the Government $5,300,000,000 . " He admits , however , that a large part of this amount would have come back to the Treasury in excess profits taxes even if there had been no price adjustment law . " At the very least , " he adds , " $1,500,000,000 has been saved that would not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , obviously , that really represents any saving to the Government . As corporation taxes increase , the possible savings through renegotiation must correspondingly diminish . An excess profits tax of 95 per cent , as provided in the present Congressional bill , if accompanied by a post-war refund of 10 per cent , will mean that all but 15 per cent of excess profits will be taken in taxes . In that case , renegotiation in many instances will save the Government only 15 cents out of every dollar . The practical question must be asked whether this 15-cent saving will in every case be worth what it costs . One suggestion that has been made is that corporations which , after present taxes , have not earned more than their pre-war earnings should not be subject to renegotiation . This , it is argued , would " screen out " the great bulk of corporations now subject to renegotiation so that the procedure would apply only to corporations having profits after taxes in excess of their prewar earnings . This proposal is open to some objections . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renegotiation procedure is itself open , and in view of the grave administrative problem of renegotiation on the present scale , it is worth asking whether some such compromise as this is not the best way out of an otherwise almost unmanageable problem .
