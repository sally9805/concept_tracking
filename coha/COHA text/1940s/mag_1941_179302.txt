A Nazi conquest of Russia ( wrote the analysts in the White House ) would : 1 ) remove armed resistance from Germany 's eastern flank ; 2 ) extend Germany 's flank to the Pacific ; 3 ) furnish Germany needed resources from Russia and the Middle East ; 4 ) allow an all-out attack on the British Isles ; 5 ) allow a drive for Nazi conquest of all Northern Africa ; 6 ) strengthen German propaganda peace moves . <P> These facts , the analysts said , added up to a gigantic pincers movement directed at the U.S. , one arm moving toward the Pacific trade routes , the other toward the trade routes in the North &; South Atlantic . <P> The White House advisers concluded : the U.S. must shape a clear-headed policy based on these facts . From the facts Franklin Roosevelt then decided : <P> &gt; The U.S. must realize that aid to Russia is aid to Russian people of all beliefs who are defending their homeland from aggression-the Russian Orthodox Church , for example , after 20 years of Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must refuse to be duped , as other democracies were duped , by German lies . The people who claim that the attack on Russia has changed the nature of the war are people who have opposed effective aid against aggression even before the war was " changed " - Hoover , Landon , Lindbergh , et al . <P> As a result , concluded Mr. Roosevelt , the U.S. must act at once to strengthen every point of resistance to the German pincers movement that threatens U.S. security : 1 ) the British Isles , 2 ) Russia , 3 ) China , 4 ) the Near East , 5 ) Africa . <P> The President , on the strength of this analysis , now called in his Lend-Lease Administration . He said : the U.S. has not sent Russia one blankety-blank thing to help her fight the war ; I want action and action now to get materials and weapons moving ; get tough ; if necessary , use a heavy hand . <P> At the Friday , Aug.1 Cabinet meeting the President again outlined his views ; said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had ordered such aid to move immediately . There was lengthy discussion , but the Cabinet agreed . <P> The Lend-Leasers ran into really tough opposition : the U.S. Army and the British . The War Department generals began talking about the need for equipment for the autumn maneuvers ; how Congress was expecting the maneuvers to show a big improvement in equipment . The British in Washington flatly balked . The situation was immediately laid before Prime Minister Winston Churchill . <P> This week aid will start . The Russians will get short-range bombers , pursuit planes , tanks , anti-tank guns . Later-if there is a later-Russia will need other things : gasoline , raw materials .
