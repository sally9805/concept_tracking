In the years when he used to confuse fellow delegates to the late League of Nations with such phrases as " China is not a nation , " talkative , persuasive Yosuke Matsuoka shuttled comfortably back &; forth between Japan and Europe by boat . Last week there was little comfort to be had traveling anywhere in the Eastern Hemisphere , and a boat trip from Japan to Europe was hazardous and well-nigh impossible . For his much-publicized trip to Berlin , Japan 's Foreign Minister chose the creaky , dirty , uncomfortable Trans-Siberian Railroad , and he let it be assumed that he would stop en route in Moscow . Just after Yosuke Matsuoka had departed , however , it was announced that he would not stop in Moscow . <P> This narrowed the speculation about the Foreign Minister 's trip to the question of what was being planned for Berlin . In Berlin and in Rome the newspapers were full of vague portents as to Japan 's part in the coming grand offensive ( see col. 2 ) . Yosuke Matsuoka chose to treat his trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tokyo , at Yamada , he walked down the street to a barbershop and had his hair trimmed around the neck and ears . Later he met reporters and told them that he had given up wearing his hair Prussian-style , an affectation he assumed when Japan resigned from the League of Nations in 1931 . <P> Rattling on , Yosuke Matsuoka told the reporters everything about his trip except the things they wanted to know . " I have been through a whirlwind of official duties . Now I have some leisure and I am taking this trip to Europe . . . . Hitler must be desiring to see this face of mine , though it is an uninteresting one . ... I must return as soon as possible , as the Japanese nation seems to be looking forward to what presents I will bring back . " <P> The Japanese nation was looking forward to these presents with some apprehension . The official news agency , Domei , assured the people that " his mission to Europe is as peaceful as peaceful can be . " Asahi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great prudence and mature consideration are required . " Rear Admiral Tanetsugu put Japan 's fears in a nutshell : unless Germany and Italy can trap the British Fleet in the Mediterranean , the Admiral wrote , the British Navy will command the Atlantic and the U. S. Navy the Pacific . Then " the new strategy to blockade Japan at a distance may be brought into play . " <P> With Great Britain and Greece , as well as pro-British Turkey and wavering Yugoslavia , taking heart from the passage of the Lend-Lease Bill , it looked as if Yosuke Matsuoka 's trip would be a race between German power politics and time . If Germany could outmaneuver Britain and prevent the formation of a four-power front in the Balkans , then the demands on Japan might be limited to expressions of amity . But if things went badly for Germany in Europe , Japan might be called on to create a diversion for the U. S. in the Pacific . And that is what Japan is afraid of .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
