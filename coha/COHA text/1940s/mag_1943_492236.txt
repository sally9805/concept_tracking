// MAJOR HARRY J. HOLT , a six-footer with red- dish hair and a thin sandy mustache , started out in life to pattern after his father , a naval officer , and wound up in the Army Air Corps instead . At twenty-eight , still wearing his Annapolis class ring , he is skipper of a heavy bombardment squadron . Major Holt 's career is fairly typical of his generation , and his squadron  --  which we shall call Squadron K  --  is typical of the Flying Fortress and Liberator units engaged in raiding Nazi submarine pens , factories and railway centers , In one respect , however , Squadron K is not typical-70 per cent of its original flying personnel at this writing is dead , missing or imprisoned in Germany . Among neighboring units it has come to be known as The Clay-Pigeon Squadron . " There is no ascertainable reason for this . The squadron had the same training as the others , its personnel is of the highest quality , and its leadership excellent . Yet , when it goes out on sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are singled out for concentrated attack by the Focke-Wulf assassination squads . It seems to make no difference what position the Holt Detachment is flying : the F-W190 's almost invariably tackle it and try to isolate it from the bomber pack . This makes for tough , bloody going , as the Focke-Wulfa have begun to fulfill General Arnold 's prophecy that sooner or later the Luftwaffe would find a way of breaking through the terrific group firepower of the gun-bristling American ships . Squadron K , which consists exclusively of ' Fortresses , bags more than its share of German pursuits , but by various whims of fate loses more than its share of B-17 's too . And every time a B-17 goes down , its whole crew usually goes to destruction with it . Even By JACK ALEXANDER if a few crewmen succeed in bailing out , the Nazis scream down at their parachutes like bullet-spitting hawks , and not many American bomber men become prisoners of war , This in , indeed , bitter , murderous warfare , full of flame and sudden death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when one hears griping in the Nissen huts , it is not of this , but of the public men at home who snipe at the war effort , of civilians who seem to think that bombing work is just a series of clean-cut triumphs , of the dearth of spare parts with which to patch up the flak-riddled planes , and of the relatively insignificant size of the American bomber forces here . Compared to the RAF , this has been true , but Maj. Gen. Ira C. Eaker has promised that by midsummer the Americans will assume equal partnership with the British . The burden of command has begun to show on young Major Holt . A thoughtful forward pitch to his shoulders makes him look a good deal slighter than he is , and his jaw has a hard set to it , as if he had spent much time clamping his teeth together . Of a crew of ten men he took over the Channel not long ago , only one besides himself survives . The three nearest neighbors he had in an officers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed or otherwise lost to the squadron , and he has seen them all go down aver enemy territory . The replacements report bright and eager , and soon the vacancies begin appearing among their hunks too . I met Major Holt in the officers ' club during the first night of my visit here and walked with him over a mud-smeared concrete road to his new quarters , a small brick one-room structure . He was quiet and he kept his head low and his hands buried in his mackinaw pockets . At the entrance to his quarters he kicked off his muddy arctics and stepped across the threshold to inspect his blackout curtains by the light of a hand flash before turning on the electric light , as there is no telling when the Nazis may drop over for a nocturnal strafing . He tuned in the radio to a BBC program . Tossing his gloves and garrison cap on the iron cot , he lighted a fire in a cast-iron stove , a boxlike affair invented by Benjamin Franklin and clung to ever since by the British . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if thinking out loud as he watched the kindling catch aluwly and exhale smoke through the damper into the room . " One in the water " meant that one of Holt 's Fortresses , unable to limp home that afternoon , was down in the dark somewhere in the ocean between France and England . One Fortress , ten men . Reports kept coming in by telephone all evening , but it was n't until next day that the final depressing word was to arrive . Launches of the British Air Sea Rescue Service , searching all night , had found only a yellow leather seat cushion of the type used in the bombers . Sleep is always difficult for aviators in wartime , but especially for a squadron leader whose chickens have not all returned to roost . Major Holt pitched a few pieces of coal onto the kindling and got down on one knee to prime the draft with a hand bicycle pump . Then he got up and lighted a portable oil stove and placed a pot of water on top of it for coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands occupied . As midnight struck , the BBC signed off urbanely and Holt worked hi . ial carefully through a field of squeaking and whistling . Then soft music came through clearly  --  German Lieder , followed by lively jazz selections . This was the regular two-hour midnight Nachtmusih program broadcast from Berlin for the purpose of raising the morale of night workers in the Reich 's armament factories . There was no propaganda , just announcements of song titles , delivered in unctuous gutturals . It may be news to the Berlin radio management , but its Nachtmusik does as much for the morale of the American Air Forces as it does for the Krupp workers . " The Hun puts out good jazz , " the major said , with the impartiality of a man sampling a cheese tray , adding , " American recordings most likely . " He sat down and lit a cigarette , putting it aside after taking a few puffs . He looked into the pot to see if the water had come to a boil , then walked over to his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyishly in red paint , and pulled out a pair of ebony bones , a small concertina and harmonica . Sitting on the foot locker , with his left hand held high , he skillfully rattled the bones in time with a recording of Jingle , Jangle . Jingle . The mood was a brief one . He put the articles back in the foot locker with the air of a man replacing mementos in a safe-deposit box . He sat down again and we talked , over coffee and figeiewton cookies from the post exchange . He spoke of his wife , Jean , whose portrait had the place of honor on a table which served as his desk ; of her skill at drawing funny pictures , and her letters , which let him know he was missed , but made it plain that she was with him in the work he was doing ; of the technique of shooting a pistol from the hip ; of his pride in his younger brother , who is helping to develop important naval instruments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped with a lathe and hung with tools of all descriptions . There was a place in the desert out in California , named Twenty-nine Palms , and after the war he said he intended driving out there with an automobile trailer and living in it until he could build a home for his wife and himself . In a photograph-viewing apparatus , which stood on the table , he placed color films of the Twenty-nine Palms site taken from many angles . By means of a filter arrangement , he was able to alter the lighting to simulate the different stages of the day . " There you see her at high noon , " he would say , and " Now you catch her around sundown when all the colors soften up . It 's the loveliest place I ever saw . " Then he got down to the subject which was weighing most heavily on his mind  --  his men who have gone down before his eyes , and the letters he writes home to the mothers and fathers and wives , trying to console them as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay a visit to all of them after the war if , as he puts it , God Iota him come through it alive , and to give them the final details ( Continued on Page 70 ) 70 ( Continued from Page 15 ) they all seem to hunger for , many of which must now remain secret for military reasons . I read some of the replies he had received . It was wrenching to note how , after the deadening impact of the first shock had passed , the people back home begged for all possible information about the terrible last moments , to wear as the cloth of patriotic mourning . Publication at home of letters written by soldiers to their folks is common enough , but people who have never been on the receiving end of a War Department telegram rarely see the side of the picture disclosed in the corraspondence of a man like Major Halt . It is with a view to furnishing this insight that a few excerpts from his mail are herewith given . There is , for instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their front yard in memory of their son , and tly from it daily the flag which draped his casket when he was brought home . Then there is the letter from Lt. Forrest Patterson 's mother in Dillies . Patterson was killed in a training-flight accident in England . " The loss of our son has been a paralyzing shock , " Mrs. Patterson writes . " My mind refused to move far from the devastating realization that when the war is over and the boys come , Forrest wo n't be with you . And I was so sure , so very sure , he would be . We do not worry much about his welfare , for he was a Christian , fine and clean and strong , with much to give . Other parents our country over have suffered and are suffering this same loss . Their lads were doubtless just as fine , with as much to give to a postwar world . Many must fall , but more will be spared and the best in those who fall will live on for good in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the accident . We suppose they were on a routine training flight with Forrest at the controls and Bob Cameron and Bill ANA 24,1943 Kuhlman two of the crew . There must have been others . Who were they ? Where were their homes ? What caused the crash ? These are only a few of the countless questions we might ask . If it is really necessary to wait until the war is over , of course we will do so willingly . But who can tell us then ? " " We are proud of Bill , " writes the mother of Lt. William F. Gise , of Yoa ktun , Texas . " It was so gratifying to read what you wrote of him . He had so much courage and determination . He made up in courage what he lacked in size . His smile ! I can see him all the time . We are praying constantly , as are all of Bill 's friends . He would be pleased if he knew that our whole town is saddened and so eager for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life to us , and the joy of our home , His place can never be filled in our hearts . We must carry on and be the good soldier he was . He never wanted me to cry . " Bill told me many times that he did n't feel he was going to live very long and he was not afraid to die . I wish we knew the raid he was in . We have an idea , and from all accounts he did n't have much chance . Thanks for taking care of his effects . I would love to have his wings . He was so proud when he won them . When Bill went down he gave them all he had . We will appreciate any further information . ' May God keep you safe , ' is our prayer . " Bill Glee , a navigator , was in a plane which was flying wing to wing with Major Holt 's in Squadron K 's first raid on Lille . The Nazi pursuits came in on Bill 's side and their incendiaries set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop out of formation and fall behind . Holt and another pilot tried to stay with him , but the lamed Fortress continued to lose speed and finally fell off in flames , downward and to the right No one saw Gise after that , and he and his mates were given up for lost , but word has since come that Bill Gise is alive in a German prison camp . A few other members of his crew bailed out safely , too , but have not been heard from . Lt. William P. Erickson , of Braintree , Massachusetts , who was Major Holt 's bombardier , was killed by a 20-mm. cannon shell as he crouched over his bombsight to lay a packet on the submarine pens at St. Nazaire . His mother writes Holt : " In this terrible turmoil and hell on earth , I was wondering if you could give me some more details as to how and where Bill died . Also how and where he is buried . " This is followed by a request that temporary interment be entrusted to an uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving here . " His Christmas parcels , which are many , 1 wish to be opened . " The letter continues : " Any personal things please forward to me , as 1 will prize them , but cigars , cigarettes , stationery and such , give to his companions . I wish to have returned to me his silver wings . . . . God never gave a better son or brother to anyone . Why does this cruel war take the best of the world ? Bill , in life , could never harm any person . . . . " Harry Holt is the wrong person to ask for a rationalization of the cruelties brought on by wars . He takes the tragedies as hard as do the families back in the States . " I guess 1 should n't , " he says , " but 1 ca n't help it . It does something to you when you come back without them . You hate to think of anybody being left behind . " British winter weather is wretched for Hying , and for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are canceled before departure time , or " scrubbed , " in bomber lingo . When a mission is scrubbed , the problem of the flying personnel is how to spend the time intervening until the next one . The fresher replacements sit in the intelligence library studying the recognition charts of enemy aircraft . This is old stuff to the veterans . Some of them play darts or ping-pang in the recreation room . Some head for the nearest village in quest of entertainment . Major Holt 's spare hours , when no administrative duties interfere , are spent in various ways . He may get out his tools and affix a pair of miniature silver wings to a mate 's cigarette lighter , or use the initialing dies he bought in the London junk shop to stamp his name on articles of equipment , or he may repair watches belonging to members of the squadron . He has a regular watchmaker 's eyepiece through which he squints as his tools move inside the delicate movements . " I guess I am a tinkerer of gadgets , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from childhood were mathematics , firearms and mechanics , and ultimately these interests were to swing his life line across that of the Clay-Pigeon Squadron . When seven years old , Harry made a crystal radio set which actually worked . This was when his father , now Capt . Fred W. Holt , of the Navy Compensation Board , Washington , was stationed at an abandoned World War 1 naval-training ground at Norfolk . If it had n't been for the Spanish language , Holt probably would be in the Navy instead of the Army today . Languages bothered him , and in 1938 ? his final year at Annapolis  --  he drove himself to concentrate on Spanish . This took up most of his time , and as a result his grades in other subjects ) fell and he was " busted out . " He had already made up his mind what he would do in such a crisis , and he acted promptly . Buying a secondhand automobile , he threw his luggage into it and headed straight for Randolph Field , Texas . He made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were interrupted only by stops for food and ben zedrine tablets . After he had been accepted into the Air Corps , he broke the news by long-distance telephone to his father , who was then stationed in Chicago . All Captain Holt could say for a few seconds was , " Dlt , Harry ; oh , Harry . " There was a long naval tradition in the family , but after a while Captain Holt got used to his son being in the Army . In due course , Harry Holt moved on from Randolph to the advanced school at Kelly Field , receiving his wings on February 1 , 1939 , and getting married the next day . His bride was Miss Jean Snavely , a pretty brunette from Texas , whom he had met six years earlier on a blind Halloween date in Washington , where she was attending school . After training in various tactical squadrons , Holt helped to ferry Lockheed Hudsons from Burbank to Montreal , where other ferry pilots took them to England under Lend-Lease . Then he was sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a happy period for the Hotta . Mrs. Holt had a receiving set which could be tuned in to the frequency of her husband 's plane radio , and by listening in she could tell when he was coming home to meals . The bp attack on Pearl Harbor broke up the idyllic Fresno scene . The Bad Luck Begins Late last summer the squadron Holt now commands , set up quarters at this airdrome , which formerly was used by the RAF . On the day the group got here a lone German plane was shot down by RAF fighters within view of the field . The war seemed close . The crews settled down to practicing formation flying and to getting acquainted with the local topography . Messes were established , the squadron commanders seeing to it that the enlisted men 's mess got the best cook , the junior officers ' mess the second bast , and the senior officers ' mess the third best . For a few weeks when supplies were slow in coming , the food was makeshift , but now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and butter and a variety of vegetables , it is no rarity for the messes to have freshly made doughnuts , hot biscuits , cinnamon buns and layer cake all on the same day . Staff Sgt. Norman L. Johnson , one of Major Holt 's men , endeared the new arrivals to the residents hereabouts by saving a girl from drowning in a river . Then the bad luck started for Holt 's squadron . Early in October . during a practice formation at high altitude , something went wrong with the oxygen line of a waist gunner in the Fortress piloted by Lt. William W. Ely , of St. Paul. , Minnesota . The gunner keeled over and his face turned blue . The other waist gunner gave the alarm over the intercom , and Ely nosed his Fortress over steeply into a dive , hoping to reach less rarefied levels before his gunner died from lack of oxygen . This was an error of the heart and a costly one . The Fortress crashed , killing six officers and men , including Lieutenant Ely and his copilot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier in this article . Two crewmen managed to bail out and land without injury . One of them , Staff Sgt. Raymond E. McAskill , of Syracuse , New York , had to be restrained from diving into the burning wreckage after the bombsight , which was buried several feet in the ground . The bad luck hung on when the squad . eon took part in its fret action  --  a big daylight raid on Lila , on October ninth . It was singled out by the Focke-Wulf 190 ' 8 as it turned to make its target run . The Fortress piloted by Capt . John W. ( Swede ) Olson , of Hyde Park , Massa-chusetts , began to lag with iLq No. 3 engine afire . Then other areas of the ship ( Continued on Page 73 ) ( Continuo : , from Popo 711 burst into flame and the plane lost altitude rapidly , falling in a spiral with the Nazis screaming down after it . The Fortress exploded on striking the ground . This was the plane from which Navigator Bill Gise escaped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way down , but the top turret gunner , Technical Sgt. D. H. Wiseenback , of Klamath Falls , Oregon , stuck to his guns , determined not to miss his first chance at an enemy plane . His twin .50 calibers blazed all the way down and his bullets found and destroyed an F-W 190 . In the squadron record he is credited posthumously with one enemy plane . For weeks thereafter impossible weather caused scrubbing of mission after mission , and the squadron diary notes that there was " lots of grousing at lost sleep and chafing at inaction . " On November third , in a raid on Brest , the squadron came through without a loss , knocking down one enemy plane for certain , getting four probablea and damaging four others . On November ninth , it took part in another raid on Lille with a Spitfire escort , This was a successful raid , except that Major Holt 's bomb release stuck over the target and he was unable to unload his explosives . Then came a raid on the machine shops of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within Squadron K a superstition had started to grow up around the right-wing position . Olson had been shot out of this spot and others had been badly mauled there , Determined to break this feeling , Holt flew the position himself this time . This was the sweep in which his bombardier , Lieutenant Erickson , was killed . A flak shell pierced the greenhouse and struck him squarely . The plane itself was not seriously damaged and Major Holt quickly pulled his salvo handle and Erick-son 's bombs fell away . For tactical reasons , the St. Nazaire raid was made at a level of from six to eight thousand feet and Major Holt had the misfortune to be assigned to the final wave . By the time it approached the target , the flak batteries , already well alerted , sent up a withering fire . Besides killing Erickson , the flak sent the plane of Lt. James M. Stewart , of Moscow , Idaho , spinning into the harbor . In an adjoining squadron , heavy flak blew away the nose of a Fortress , tearing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down with one man dangling from the bomb bay by his parachute shroud lines . There were no pursuits up that day . They were n't needed . On November eighteenth , flak disabled the plane of Lt. Ralph J. Gaston , of LOB Angeles , four minutes after Squadron K had unloosed its bombs on the submarine base at La Pallice and was homeward-bound . Gaston notified his unit leader that his No- 3 engine had failed and that the ship seemed to be vibrating apart . He was already a mile behind and the squadron slowed down to give him a chance to catch up . Then it ran into heavy clouds and Gaston was seen to turn north toward the Brest peninsula . He was n't seen by his mates again , but word reached the squadron that he and his copilot , Lt. Don . H. Eldridge , of Chicago , were prisoners of war . The other crew members have not been heard from yet , but they may turn up in prison camps , as the pilot and copilot are always the last to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squadron got together and began talking of getting a mascot . Pooling their money , they raised more than $400 and gave it to the British Orphans Fund conducted by The Stars and Stripes newspaper in London . In exchange , they were permitted to " adopt " a three-year-old girl named Maureen , whose father , a former stonemason , had died in service and whose mother was working as a charwoman at ten shillings a week to supplement her widow 's pension . They nicknamed Maureen " Sweet-pea " and painted the nickname on one of the squadron 's new replacement Fortresses . Sweetpea was to visit the airdrome personally on December nineteenth . That morning the squadron , in company with several others , took off in crisp and cloudless weather , perfect for high-level bombing . When the formation was fifty miles inside France and still un the way to its objective , the Fortress piloted by Lt. Lewis R. McKesson , of Pasadena , was shot down . The formations kept on going and as they reached the target  --  an aircraft plant at Romilly-sur-Seine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eiffel Tower in Paris was clearly visible to the crews as they began circling the target preparatory to making the bombing run . The Fortresses threw out plenty of lead and the F-W 190 's fell like flies , but it was a tragic mission for Squadron K. During the melee , flak and Nazi pursuits knocked down two more of its planes  --  those piloted by Lt. John R. McKee , of Barrington , New York , and Lt. Denton 3 . Nygaard , of Buffalo . The Sweetpea got home with one engine out of commission . a wing ripped by a chunk of fink , a supercharger shot away , and the rubber dinghy hanging in shreds from the horizontal stabilizer , which itself was almost destroyed . A 20-mm , shell had blown it there . The bomber group had shut down forty-four enemy fighters . It had lost three Fortresses . all of which belonged to Squadron K. And so it goes . Almost every time n raiding party returns , there are newly vacant hunks in some of the barracks . A missing man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sorting out his effects , taking out official papers and making an inventory of personal things to be sent home to his survivors . It is a disheartening experience . Under such circumstances and considering the nerve-racking nature of bombing work , it is not surprising that some of the men should get premonitions of death . Lieutenant Olson. for instance , told his mates calmly , on the night pre . ceding the squadron 's maiden raid , that he felt positive that he was going to " get it . " He did . On the night preceding a raid on St. Nazaire , Lieutenant Stewart 's copilot gave all his money to his mess sergeant . " I 'm not going to he needing it again , " he explained . He crashed in the harbor with Lieutenant Stewart . One of the most popular men in a near-by squadron was a wealthy New York youngster who liked fancy clothes . In his locker he kept a London-tailored uniform and a pair of expensive English flying boots . On the evening before one of the St. Nazaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be ' his last trip across the Channel . " I 'm going out in my fancy duds and be the best-dressed prisoner or corpse in Germany , " he added . His plane failed to return . It is probable , of course , that most premonitions fail of fulfillment and are forgotten , and that only the ones which are borne out are remembered . Most fliers , as in Major Holt 's ease , hope for a break from the law of averages and take little stock in premonitions . Holt is quick to spot signs of burgeoning superstition and to do his utmost to demonstrate the fallacy of it . When he was about to take off on his first raid , a ground-officer friend gave him a good-luck piece to carry . It was a small ivory elephant in which a tiny compass had been embedded . After seven or eight sweeps , Holt found himself beginning to believe in the charm and quit currying it . One of the most difficult things a squadron commander has to contend with is the extreme sensitivity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , he is forced , by engine trouble or other unavoidable mishap , to abort during sweep  --  that is , swing out of formation and head for home without having bombed the target . It gives him a feeling that he has dose ted his mates . Lieutenant , McKee , who had been a shipbuilder in civilian life , was one of Holt 's most dependable officers . It was McKee who , with Holt , had dropped back in an unsuccessful attempt to cover the lagging Olson during the squadron 's initial sweep . In a subsequent sweep , McKee , through an error . had aborted for the first time , The lead ship of the element in which he was flying a wing position developed engine trouble on the way over and turned off to abort . Has breakaway signal had not been plainly given and McKee , thinking his lead man was merely changing course , turned off and followed . He was chagrined when his leader took him directly back toward the home airdrome and it was too late to rejoin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower , where Major Holt , who had not gone out on the sweep , was waiting for the raiders to return . Soon the other Fortresses came winging homeward in perfect formation . " Gosh , " exclaimed McKee with relief , " it looks as if nobody got hurt after all , " As the formation crossed the airdrome , red rockets burst from the pilots ' compartment of one of the planes . A red rocket means " wounded men aboard . " " It looks like someone really did get it , " remarked Holt as he scrambled down the stairs to help unload the wounded . Lieutenant McKee mistakenly took the incident and Holler ; innocent remark to heart . He was heard to say at the officers ' club that evening that even if all his guns jammed on the next mission , he would proceed toward the target " as long as those four fans keep turning . " The next mission was the Romitly-surSeine raid on December nineteenth .

The ship twisted into another spin and once more flattened out , and two more parachutes appeared . They were probably those of McKee and his copilot , as the plane carried only nine men that day . Nothing has been heard from any of them since . Most aviators take up flying for the fun and beauty of it . Pure flight is thrilling , and no matter how dark or stormy the weather may be at ground level , it is sunny and cheerful up above the cloud layers . But combat flying is cold homicide of a peculiarly brutal sort , and there is no fun in it , except for a few hardy souk , to whom peacetime flying seems to lack something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would n't abandon the job for anything , but added that if they survived the war they would settle down on a Midwestern chicken farm and never look at an airplane again . No reason has been found for the jinx which clings to the Clay-Pigeon Squadron . But Major Holt has a theory , the principle of which was originally enunciated in his presence by a friend in Twenty-nine Palms , California , who is a doctor of philosophy . For years , the friend had been observing the frequency with which accident befell a woman neighbor who lived alone on a neighboring strip of desert . Wolves were few on the desert , but if one turned up at night and killed a dog , it was sure to be the woman 's dog . If a fire broke out , it was sure to break out in the woman 's dwelling . If a rare species of reptile strayed into the neighborhood , it was sure to take shelter under a rock in her yard . Everything happened to her . " My friend .
