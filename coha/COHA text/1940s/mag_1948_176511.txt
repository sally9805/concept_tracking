It was hard to realize that only four months ago Harry Truman had addressed an auditorium full of empty seats at Omaha . As he walked out on the stage at Philadelphia 's Convention Hall ( capacity : 14,000 ) one night last week , the band pumped out Hail to the Chief , and 12,000 people yelled , whistled , clapped , and yipped out the familiar cry : " Give ' em hell , Harry ! " <P> Whatever hell may be to others , hell to Harry Truman seems to be a world populated by the Republican members of the 80th Congress . The G.O.P. , cried Harry , wants to put all the people of the country " in one big company union and run it for the benefit of the National Association of Manufacturers . " The crowd roared . He sniped at Tom Dewey 's theme of unity . " We do n't believe in the unity of slaves . . . or sheep , " he said . In all , he was applauded 24 times during the course of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubting the President 's growing entertainment value . This was demonstrated again &; again as he pressed on through last week 's three-day campaign tour . As his train chuffed through eastern Pennsylvania 's industrial towns big , obviously curious crowds turned out to see him . <P> They applauded when he " gave ' em hell . " They watched with pleased but oddly silly smiles as he exchanged badinage with admirers , received presents , indulged in wisecracks . For all their friendliness , his listeners acted more like a vaudeville audience than a political crowd . They were vastly entertained by Harry 's whipcracks at the Republican elephant . But they did not seem particularly impressed by the import of what they heard ; at times they seemed almost to shrug , good-humoredly , at Harry 's more intemperate statements . <P> In Jersey City , tall , sour-faced Boss Frank Hague ( who had once predicted that Truman would lose New Jersey by 300,000 votes ) now did his best for Harry . Fireworks spouted like golden fountains and for a mile the crowds were jammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people stood through an early morning downpour to hear him . <P> Butcher Knife . Then the presidential train began a station-to-station run to Buffalo . Seven thousand people stayed through a violent cloudburst at Auburn , Republican Congressman John Taber 's home town . They cheered lustily as Harry Truman berated Taber for using " a butcher knife and a saber and a meat ax . . . on every forward-looking program . . . " There were more crowds at Schenectady , Amsterdam , Little Falls , Utica , Rome , Oneida , Syracuse , Seneca Falls , Geneva , Rochester , and Buffalo . And there would be great crowds again this week as the President toured the Middle West . Politicos and columnists seemed puzzled by the phenomenon . But the President himself , with a peculiar combination of frankness and naivet , offered a plausible explanation . Said he in a speech at Batavia , N.Y. : " I think they want to find out whether all this propaganda that has been put out-about the President not being able to do his job-is true or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
