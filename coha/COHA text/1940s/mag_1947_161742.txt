Its most important cargo : $287,000 in crisp bills to pay drillers and riggers . It brought also a surprise . When company paymasters opened the moneybag , they found only bricks and old newspapers . A Day of the Innocents ' joke , was their first thought .

Rivas was arrested , told all : with a cashier accomplice he had switched moneybags just before the San Tome-bound plane took off from Caracus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Innocents , commemorating the killing , by order of King Herod of Judea , of Bethlehem 's children under the age of two years .
