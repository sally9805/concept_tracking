txt WASHINGTON , Oct. 26 ? An angry Senate farm bloc , demanding revisions in Federal price policies which would permit prices paid to farmers for their products to go higher , was turned down today by James F. Byrnes , Economic Stabilization Director ; Leon Henderson , Federal Price Administrator , and Secretary Wickard . Mr. Henderson , denouncing an attempt to " gun " him out of his job and to " sabotage " the Office of Price Administration , estimated that granting of farm bloc demands would add $100,000,000 annually to the price of bread alone . He offered no estimates of the over-all increase in living costs ' which would result from the proposed revision . The basic issue debated before the Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee was whether President Roosevelt had authority of Congress to direct Messrs . Byrnes , Henderson and Wickard to " consider present governmental payments to agricultural producers , and subsidy payments , in arriving at the minimum ceiling prices . " The farm bloc contended that he did not have such authority , and Senator Reed of Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional determination . Told by all three top-men that Attorney General Biddle had given an opinion upholding the right of the Administration to include subsidy payments in determining maximum prices , Senator Reed snapped that " The Attorney General of the United States gives any opinion the White House wants . " Senator Ellender of Louisiana , who was presiding , rebuked his colleague from Kansas , telling him to confine himself to questioning and not to offer testimony or argue with the witnesses . Most of the controversy concerned the ceilings which have been placed on flour and potatoes . In the case of flour , Mr. Henderson said that the ceiling reflected a price of $1.03 per bushel for wheat , paid by the miller , instead of $1.34 per bushel which would be necessary if the ceiling reflected a full parity pric3 . In the case of potatoes , Senator Brewster of Maine said the ceiling in Aroostook County , Me. , which must move 15,000,000 bushels this month , permitted a price equal to only 65 per cent of parity . Much of the argument about inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which ceilings could be placed on farm prices dealt with an interpretation of the law by Senator Brown of Michigan , which was placed in the Congressional Record on the day Congress passed the bill . Senator Brown 's interpretation , which was cited by Mr. Byrnes in his testimony , contended that it was proper to include such payments . Senator Aiken of Vermont charged that Senator Brown 's statement was " a deliberately false interpretation inserted surreptitiously in the records , " to which Mr. Byrnes , a former Senator , replied with some heat : " I think the Senator from Vermont ought to say that in the presence of the Senator from Michigan . " Several Senators asserted that Mr. Brown had not made the statements from the floor , and contended that his interpretation should be removed from the record . Senator Reed , insisting that the Senate on several occasions had made clear its opposition to a subsidy program , told Mr. Henderson and Secretary Wickard that " if you think this hearing is the last you 're going to hear on this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If the Senator thinks I 'm not going to take the action indicated by the law , because of threats that I 'll hear more about it , then he 's mistaken . I 'm going ahead the way I see it . I do n't care if I 'm opposed by the Chicago Beard of Trade , some speculators , or some independent farmers ; I 'm going to administer this law until they achieve their purpose of knocking my head off . " Senator Wheeler of Montana interjected that he thought Mr. Henderson was taking too seriously newspaper accounts of Senatorial attempts to " get him . " Senator Wheeler advised Mr. Henderson do something to restrict the spread between the price paid farmers and the prices paid by consumers , declaring that it was the middle man who " robbed " both of them . Mr. Henderson replied that the act of Congress , forbidding interference with existing business practices , would prevent such a change in the distributive system .                 @ @ @ @
