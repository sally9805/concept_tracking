txt By WARREN MOSCOW Si.ecial to Tam NEW YOBS TntEs . ALBANY , Feb. ** Republicans in the Senate tonight took the initiative away from the Assembly , which has long dominated the fiscal policies of the party , and agreed , in secret conferences , to a State budget plan to be presented to their Assembly colleagues tomorrow . The plan involves balancing of the budget without the $15,000,000 income tax increase recommended by Governor Lehman . It scraps also the suggestion that the State make up its budgetary deficit by decreasing the return to localities throughout the State of the proceeds of State-shared taxes . Objections to this procedure cropped up over the week-end . Despite the strict orders of secrecy which surrounded the unexpected meeting of the five Senate members of the special fiscal committee appointed last week , it is known that the plan to be presented tomorrow involves a cut in the $55,000,000 relief fund which Governor Lehman proposed for this year . Total of Cut Not Revealed The Governor included $60,000 , - 000 for relief in his budget , the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of the current fiscal year , June 30 . The amount of the cut proposed in the relief appropriation has not been revealed . Advocates of the cut have contended that home-relief costs throughout the State have been dropping sharply and that the cut can easily be made . If a deficiency occurs it can be made up early next year , they point out . Whatever specific information is available points to a cut of $5,000 , - 000 to $6,000,000 in the relief funds . If it is made , it will be contrary to the policy on relief decided upon by the Dewey forces in the State . It has been known for some time that Mr. Dewey 's friends have felt that a relief cut in New York might put Mr. Dewey in an unfavorable light throughout the nation so far as his Presidential aspirations are concerned . The indications are that the Senate Republicans have moved fast to forestall a counter-move by Mr. Dewey 's friends . Mr. Dewey will be here tomorrow , to make a speech , but has indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Cut Likely A cut is likely also in State aid for education . How large a cut can be made is at issue , but one along the lines of last year 's $9,000,000 reduction is not expected . In fact , only a token cut is likely this year . It was stated definitely that the income tax increase had been killed , so far as the Senate conferees were concerned . Whether a new tax of any kind was in mind was not made clear . In response to a direct question , a Senate conferee said : " We discussed no other new tax this afternoon . " The Senate Conference Committee on the budget consists of Senators Wicks , Williamson , Thompson , // ALBANY SENATORS TAKE BUDGET HELM // Hastings , Janes and Majority Leader Hanley . Up to the time they met this afternoon , in a Hotel Ten Eyck room , there had been no indication that the Senate had any plans of its own on the budget . However , apparently smarting under the charge that the Senate was blocking budget action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The declaration from responsible Senators after the meeting was that the plan , secret as it was , would have the support of every Republican member of the State Senate . As details of the plan seeped out tonight , however , the opinion was ventured that it would be difficult to get it through the Senate . Several Senators , it was said , were committed against various features of the plan , especially if it included cuts in capital outlays and suspension of mandatory salary increases , as one report had it . Slated for Conference It was indicated , however , that the plan would be submitted to the Assembly conference Wednesday , after the meeting of the Senate and Assembly committees tomorrow . A new tax , possibly of the luxury variety , is still a possibility because it is not disclosed whether the budget cuts agreed to by the Senate conferees add up to the $15,000,000 needed to balance the budget . The reason the cut in State-shared taxes was vetoed by the Senators was outlined in THE NEW YORK TIMES this morning . By depriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would cause a rise in local real estate taxes . Speaker Heck , after announcing in the Assembly tonight the conference on Wednesday of Assembly Republicans , declared this the last night for introduction of original resolutions and March 1 the last day for introduction of local bills except with unanimous consent .
