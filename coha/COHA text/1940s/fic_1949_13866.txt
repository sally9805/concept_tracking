A large room in a broken-down hotel apartment on 52nd Street , west of Broadway . Doors to : bedroom , bath , kitchenette , and hall . Window on street . A FLOOR-LAMP is lit , but no one is in the room . The dollar ALARM-CLOCK on the bureau rings and slowly stops . PHILIP JUDAH , a young man , comes in through the hall door . Fools with the door several times , turning the knob , wondering why the door was left open , or if it had been . He is drunk . He studies the door . Goes out into the hall . Comes back in . Goes through his pockets , removing all sorts of odds and ends : letters , pencils , pocket knives , a watch , a pair of dice , which he rolls a couple of times , the joker of a deck of cards , a handful of Automat crackers , which he takes to the window . He opens the window , thoughtfully crumbles the crackers onto the sill , and looks out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turns on the RADIO . Continues to go through his pockets . When the radio bursts out with LOUD MUSIC , he jumps and turns it OFF . He finds the item he is looking for : the key to the door . He tries it in the door , and the key is the right key . He works the key in the lock three or four times to make sure , goes out into the hall , closes the door behind him , locks the door , takes the key out , and after a moment puts the key back into the lock , turns the key , opens the door , and comes into the room , exactly as he had come into the room the first time . He walks into the kitchenette and comes out with a bottle . Notices the open door as he is pouring a drink , stops pouring , goes to the door , closes it , begins looking for the key again , finds another pair of dice , rolls them again , the TELEPHONE rings , he remembers his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a LOUD KNOCK at the door which makes him jump , he quickly turns out the LIGHT .

What do you mean , somebody on the line wants to talk to me ? Who is it ? ( Loudly . ) Frances Gate ? Do n't know her . That 's a phoney name . Turn on a light , will you , Jimmy ?

You that girl I met at Izzy 's ? Her name was Margaret . Why , sure . I 'd be delighted . Fred Walpole gave you my address ? What 'd he do that for ? How is he , anyway ? Is he all right ?

You want to be a poet and have things go good , too ? LONDON I 'm not a poet . I write prose . JUDAH Well , you want to be a writer of prose and have things go good , too ? LONDON I want them to go just a little better than they do for poets . That ai n't asking much . If a man 's got to compromise , he ought to get something for it . JUDAH Compromise some more , then . Compromise until you get everything . LONDON I do n't want everything . JUDAH What kind of prose ? LONDON How do I know what kind ? I think it 's great . JUDAH She 's not pregnant and she 's very serious . LONDON That girl on the phone ? JUDAH Frances Gate . That 's a phoney name . Did you ever hear of anybody named Frances Gate ?

Something phoney there . LONDON Are those stories they tell about Goldwyn true or is that just publicity stuff , and what about Dietrich ? Has she really got those legs ? JUDAH What legs ?

What kind of a voice has she got ? Is it true that they ai n't got no more brains than a dope ? JUDAH Who ? LONDON Actresses . With legs like that . JUDAH Like what ? LONDON Do they ever read or think about anything ? JUDAH What do you want , Marlene Dietrich , or a job in Hollywood , or what ? LONDON You get tired knowing how things are . It gets to be stupid .

You 're writing a book , are n't you ? LONDON Is that a book I 'm writing ? JUDAH What 's the name of it ? LONDON I did n't know it was a book . It 's called  --  Well , I never stopped to think of a name for it . JUDAH What 's it about ? LONDON How do I know what it 's about ? Everybody wants to know what everything 's about . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew anybody who did , either . What 's a fish about ? JUDAH A fish is about  --  What the hell do you mean ? A fish is n't about anything . It 's a fish . p. 9 LONDON ( Swiftly . ) Right . Catch on ? My book is n't about anything either  --  it 's a book , the same as a fish is a fish . JUDAH All right then , what kind of a book is it , as a fish is a fish but of a certain kind , such as a whale or a shark or a herring . What kind is your book ? LONDON Whale . JUDAH ( Relaxing . ) That 's all I wanted to know  --  that 's fine . If it was anything less than a whale , I 'd ask you to leave . LONDON It 's a whale all right , do n't worry about that  --  just tell me about their legs  --  ( Pause , suddenly . ) How about the way they walk down a street  --  pretty ? JUDAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONDON Do some of ' em roll it ? ( He demonstrates , looking very foolish , as PHILIP watches , deadpan . ) JUDAH ( Swiftly . ) Dat dey do  --  dat dey do . LONDON And do some of them bump as they go away ? ( He demonstrates this too , to the deadpan amazement of PHILIP. ) p. 10 JUDAH Dat dey do  --  dat dey do . LONDON How come sometimes you talk foolish like that ? As if you were ignorant or illiterate , or somebody who never went to school . JUDAH I did n't go to school  --  besides , I 'm bored . Not with you , you understand . LONDON You 're bored  --  you 've got everything in the world , and you 're bored . What are you bored about ? JUDAH Just bored  --  just plain bored . Take those legs you were speaking of a moment ago so deliriously  --  well , they bore me , too . I look at ' em and then I look at their faces , and then I 'm bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all everything in America is . Art , education , science , labor , religion , crime , advertising , industry , government  --  it 's all sex . Everything is sex except sex , and God knows what sex has become . LONDON ( Thinking about this . ) I think you 've got something there . I think you 've unconsciously identified the texture , quality and temper of our time . Do you mind if I put that down in my book ? ( Thinking . ) That 's right  --  that covers it . Do you mind if I steal that ? JUDAH That 'll cost you ten cents . ( JIMMY begins going into a pocket swiftly . ) You can pay me later , out of the earnings of the book . p. 11 LONDON Oh , thanks  --  but I 've got a dime here somewhere . What do you think of Poe ? JUDAH The director out at Fox ? LONDON ( Almost shouting . ) No , not the director out at Fox . Edgar Allan Poe  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fine . I believe there 's somebody named Poe out at Fox  --  I believe I met him . A little fellow with a shawl and hunched-up shoulders  --  he acts very artistic . LONDON Man , you sure keep thinking about movies , do n't you  --  ? I 'm talking about Edgar Allan Poe . ( Recites . ) " Helen , thy beauty is to me  --  " JUDAH Poe 's okay . Never hurt a soul . LONDON What do you think of him as a writer ? JUDAH Overrated . LONDON Yeah ? What about O. Henry ? JUDAH Wonderful  --  overrated . LONDON Overrated in comparison to who ? JUDAH In comparison to nobody . I do n't compare people , let alone writers . A man is overrated in comparison with what is always possible but never achieved . You ca n't mention a writer who is n't wonderful . But they 're all overrated . What is always possible is still unachieved . Keep pouring yourself a drink . Do you want a girl for the night ? p. 12 LONDON ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to know the truth  --  yes . Can you get one for me ? JUDAH No  --  I just wanted to know if you wanted one . I do n't want one . There 's a girl on her way here , though , whoever she is . LONDON Now , listen , Phil  --  I feel a little awkward about this  --  but I 've been feeling  --  Well , I 'm lonely . Now , if this girl  --  JUDAH ( Hastily . ) Sure , sure  --  if it works out  --  sure . LONDON Maybe you could help it work out a little . You know . After all , you 've got a way about you . You 're tired , and they like a man who does n't leap at them . JUDAH Oh , I 'll do everything I can  --  but why do n't you take a run around the block and come back exhausted , flop in a chair and be irresistible ? Do n't say much . Speak in a weary voice when you do speak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might work . LONDON Do you really think so ? JUDAH Sure . I 've been tired in Hollywood ever since I went out there seven years ago , and you read the papers  --  you know all the famous actresses who 've had their names connected with mine . p. 13 LONDON Is that how you do it ? By being tired ? JUDAH Tired and bored  --  consistently , you understand . Up to a point , you understand . LONDON What point ? JUDAH The good Lord Himself will let you know . Go ahead  --  run around the block and come back . Just come right in and sit down  --  do n't greet anybody . When I introduce you to her just stay where you are . Did you do any running in high-school ? LONDON Yeah , sure . JUDAH What distances ? LONDON The hundred , the two-twenty . The two-twenty low hurdles , too . JUDAH Okay . You 've got a great background for women . Run the two-twenty low hurdles around the block and come back . LONDON Hurdles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake  --  are you a writer or some unimportant kind of person ? Go on out there and start running and taking the hurdles . LONDON I do n't mind trying to get tired , but jumping like that with no hurdles , right out there in the street  --  I might see somebody I know . JUDAH Well , do you want to be irresistible , or not ? p. 14 LONDON Oh I 'd like to be irresistible all right , if I could do it . JUDAH You can  --  you can . It 's a familiar run  --  you 've run it before . What is it  --  every ten yards a hurdle ? LONDON Ten or fifteen  --  I 'm not sure . JUDAH Well , take as many hurdles as you can , so you 'll get real tired and attractive . If you err , err on the side of extravagance , rather than on the side of  --  instead of on the other side . LONDON It seems a little awkward , and if anybody knew of such a thing they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been thinking about this suggestion of yours very carefully  --  and I need to get tired . I 'm on edge and too interested in Marlene Dietrich 's legs . It 's not foolish for me to get out and run . It 's very sensible . JUDAH Sure . Go ahead . LONDON ( Going . ) Okay , Phil  --  and thanks . I 'll only be a few minutes . JUDAH I 'll be at the window to see the start . LONDON Okay . ( Pause . ) Hey , Phil , you 're not making me do this for a laugh , are you ? You 're not laughing at me inside , are you ? p. 15 JUDAH Laughing ? Do n't be silly . I like to see a man behave intelligently , no matter how incredible his behavior may seem to others . My admiration for you has increased since your decision . LONDON Oh I do n't want to be a hero or anything like that , but I would like to feel that you were looking at this from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am  --  dat I am . Go ahead . LONDON Okay . ( He begins to go , taking a last gulp of the drink . ) JUDAH And do n't stop to speak to anybody , under any circumstances . It 'll spoil the whole effect . LONDON Okay . If she gets here before I get back , well , you know  --  kind of let her know  --  JUDAH No , no  --  I want you to surprise her . LONDON Okay . You understand these things better than I do . ( He goes . PHILIP gets up slowly and fixes himself a fresh drink , in the same glass . He takes a sip , then goes to the window and looks down . ) JUDAH Yeah  --  there he is . ( He waves to JIMMY . ) Great writer  --  great writer . ( He motions to JIMMY to get going , and from the way he moves his head it is obvious that JIMMY has started to run and leap over hurdles . PHILIP turns away from the window , very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He listens to VOICES from the street  --  no words are understandable , but there seems to be a COMMOTION . He listens . After a moment a PISTOL SHOT is heard . PHILIP goes to the window and looks out . While he is there , a girl comes into the room . She is FRANCES GATE , very pretty , very earnest , but a little sorrowful . She is holding an unwrapped paperback edition of the stories of Guy de Maupassant. ) p. 16 GATE Mr. Judah ? JUDAH ( Turning . ) Oh  --  hello . Oh you got me that book . ( He takes it , and takes her by the arm to a chair . ) Well , thanks  --  I want to read something tonight . Sit down . You seem a little worried . ( Another PISTOL SHOT is heard . ) Here . I 'll fix you a drink . Would you like a drink ? GATE I do n't drink  --  but I suppose it would be  --  JUDAH No  --  no . Not for a minute . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink . It 's not good for you . Everybody knows that . ( He looks at her . ) Now . Well , it 's good to see you , even though I have n't the slightest idea who you are . GATE I 'm nobody . JUDAH Nonsense . Your name is n't particularly  --  well , authentic-sounding , but you yourself make up for that . Gate  --  where 'd you get that name from ? ( Another PISTOL SHOT is heard , from far-away . ) GATE My parents . JUDAH Oh it 's your real name ? GATE Yes , it is . JUDAH Well , then , it 's okay  --  it 's a pretty name . It 's got dignity , too . p. 17 GATE ( Seriously . ) Mr. Judah  --  I know how busy you are . ( PHILIP tries to protest : Not at all . ) I 've read every word you 've written . I 've wanted to meet you ever since I read your first book , I wrote to you three years ago when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GATE But I did n't sign my name to the letter . I did n't feel that I had a right to intrude into your life . JUDAH You have every right  --  every right ! GATE I only wanted you to know that there was somebody in the world who knew about you  --  deeply  --  as I feel I do . JUDAH You do ? GATE I only wanted you to know that somebody was grateful to you for your wonderful thoughts and stories and people . JUDAH Oh thank you , thank you . GATE But little by little it seemed to me that I should seek you out and talk to you . JUDAH Oh . GATE I know how ridiculous it is to want to meet somebody famous , but it is n't that , Mr. Judah  --  believe me , it is n't that I want to know somebody famous  --  a great writer . It 's simply that I am sure you need me . You 've been going through a lot of terrible times , I know  --  I know . You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come here tonight . ( She stops. ) p. 18 JUDAH Oh . GATE I know it seems such a fat-headed thing to do  --  and everything I 've said seems so fat-headed , too . But it is n't  --  it really is n't . JUDAH Fat-headed ? Not at all  --  it 's most wonderful , and I 'm deeply grateful . ( NOISE is heard down the hall . ) Please  --  please feel at ease . Talk to me . Tell me everything that you have wanted to say . ( JIMMY LONDON breaks into the room , breathless . He closes the door behind him , and flops into a chair . This scares FRANCES , who leaps to her feet . ) Please do n't be alarmed , Miss Gate . This is my friend James London . He 's a writer . GATE Oh  --  how do you do ? LONDON Hi . ( He waves lackadaisically . ) JUDAH Drink , Jimmy ? LONDON ( Bored . ) Yes  --  please  --  make it strong . ( There is NOISE down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heavy KNOCKING on the door . ) JUDAH Come in  --  Come in . ( A breathless young COP comes in . ) SMITH Excuse me  --  I thought he came down this hall  --  Whee , that was a chase ! ( PHILIP hands him the drink , which he takes and sips . ) A thief of some kind . I chased him around the block . ( PHILIP hands JIMMY a drink , too . The COP lifts his drink . ) Good luck . p. 19 LONDON Luck . SMITH Swiftest moving man I ever saw  --  and jump ? Every ten yards or so , like a gazelle . I did n't know whether to admire him or shoot him . I tried to stop him by shooting in the air , but he kept right on running . There was quite a crowd following him after a while , so I could n't shoot him if I wanted to . I saw him run into this hotel and followed him to this floor . I guess he got away . He sure tired me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . This is Miss Gate . Mr. London . And I 'm Philip Judah . SMITH How do you do . ( He smiles to each . ) My name is Joe Smith  --  yeah , that 's my real name . Not Joseph Smith  --  just Joe . That 's what my father put down on the birth certificate . Joe Smith , September 1 , 1932 , New York City . ( He sits down . ) GATE I was born in 1933 . SMITH You 're younger . LONDON And prettier , too . SMITH You 're younger than you look  --  not that you look old or anything . It has n't got anything to do with years . You seem grown-up , but not obviously . I mean inside . GATE Inside ? p. 20 SMITH Yeah . You have the kind of expression women get when they understand things  --  some women never get that expression . Being a cop , you have to look at people and try to understand them . LONDON Yes , you do . JUDAH You 're not seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course not . I earn a living being a cop . I may as well tell you , even though it embarrasses me , that I am really interested in writing . GATE ( Eagerly . ) Are you ? So am I. SMITH Is that so ? I thought I saw something unusual about the way you look out of your eyes . You seem to have the glance of someone who is seeking  --  trying to see into things . GATE It 's true  --  all my life I 've tried to see into things instead of stopping at the surface . As I look into you , I see far beyond the cap and uniform of a policeman to a most incredibly strong and incorruptible spirit . SMITH Oh now  --  you 'll have these fellows laughing at me the first thing you know . I 've never spoken of my writings to anyone before , let alone total strangers , but somehow or other in this atmosphere it suddenly seemed foolish not to speak of it . After all , who cares whether or not I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHILIP ) or anyone else ? p. 21 GATE Oh but they do care  --  I care . SMITH Well , this is surprising . I do n't feel embarrassed . I was pretty pooped when I came in here a moment ago  --  maybe that 's the reason I blurted out that I was n't really interested in being a cop  --  that what I 'm really interested in is writing . For that matter , I still feel tired . And a little indifferent . He was a great sprinter , whoever he was . He left me in the dust . I 'm glad the people got in the way , because even if he was a thief , as they kept hollering , I would n't have enjoyed shooting him . It 's not in me to take another man 's life , thief or not . If I must shoot a man in line of duty , well , I 'll do it , but I hope I never have to before I leave the force . I 've saved up two thousand dollars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . I 'm going up to a little town in Maine and write my first book . GATE Maine ? I think Maine is wonderful . SMITH Do you really ? GATE I think Maine is the most wonderful place in the world . I 'd like to go to Maine myself  --  lose myself in a simple rustic life . SMITH That 's my idea exactly  --  get away from the noise and confusion of the world . I want to get to a place where I can feel things deeply . p. 22 GATE So do I. SMITH Now , if I had others to take care of , it would be different . But all of my people are independent  --  they 're not rich , you understand  --  they 're just independent  --  married , good jobs , children  --  perfectly happy . I 'm alone and do n't have anybody to worry about , except myself . Sometimes I think it would be a lot more exciting and human if I had somebody else to worry about , but every time I visit my brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to know if things are all right with me . My father and mother live off my father 's pension and there 's nothing I can do for them , either . They would n't think of letting me try to help them . I sent them a radio for Christmas last year , and they were very angry at me for wasting the money . But sooner or later , I suppose , I 'll be having somebody to take care of , and maybe after a while a few children . I 'm old-fashioned and I 'd like a son and a daughter , and maybe two of each . GATE Would you ? SMITH Oh yes , of course . It 's natural . The instinct and longing for fatherhood is as strong in me as the necessity to write . I 'm a sort of lone wolf spiritually  --  I like being alone , so I can think  --  but I ca n't fool my heart . It wants companionship  --  somebody for me to take care of , to think about , to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist-watch . ) Now , take tonight , for instance . In two minutes I check in  --  midnight . I go up to the Fifty-fifth Street Station , change my clothes , and then duck into an Automat for a cup of coffee and two doughnuts . I sit and rest a while , looking at the people . Then I go out for a long walk  --  sometimes I walk all the way down to the Battery , or along the river up to Grant 's Tomb . I like to walk and look at things  --  not as a cop , but as an adventurer in the world . Then after the walk , I take a subway and go home . I read for an hour or so , then I go to bed . But walking is what I enjoy most  --  seeing the people and feeling all the time that somewhere among them is the one I am looking for . I 'll find her , too . p. 23 GATE Please forgive me . Will you  --  mind if I go along with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of JIMMY and PHILIP who have been drinking steadily and watching and listening with terrible fascination  --  JIMMY always on the verge of interrupting and PHILIP always gesturing him to be quiet . ) Why , I 'd be the happiest  --  Ah , this is really too wonderful . A guy starts running down the street . Running like an athlete , not a thief . People start hollering Thief , so naturally I have to go after him . I order him to stop , but he keeps on running . Then he leaps like a gazelle , and keeps running . I chase him , but he keeps getting farther away , so I draw my gun and fire into the air . Finally I chase him all the way around the block , into this hotel , up to this floor , down this hall , and into this room . And here , instead of finding him , I find  --  ( He looks at FRANCES with deep and boyish devotion . ) Three of the most wonderful people I have ever met . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept a drink , and start talking  --  and I tell them things I 've never told anybody else before . Not even my own brothers and sisters . And now  --  you  --  Do you really want to go on this walk with me ? GATE ( Very sincerely . ) Yes , I do . p. 24 SMITH I ca n't believe it . ( Suddenly . ) But what about your friends ? ( To PHILIP . ) I do n't want to break up your party . Perhaps all of us can go on the walk . JUDAH No , really  --  we could n't . We 're both very tired . LONDON Yeah  --  tired  --  very tired . All wore out . SMITH Well , then  --  ( He looks toward the girl . ) We 'll walk along the river up to Grant 's Tomb . LONDON Yeah  --  that 's a good walk . SMITH Thanks  --  thanks to both of you . I 'll never forget your graciousness  --  JUDAH It 's all right  --  have a pleasant walk . LONDON Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  then . JUDAH Goodnight , Miss Gate .

PHILIP sees them to the door , then closes it . He stands a moment at the door , thinking , deadpan , as always . ) I never saw a more beautiful girl in my life . Or a more stupid one . p. 25 JUDAH What do you think that fellow writes ? LONDON Whatever it is , he 's overrated . ( Suddenly . ) Boy , I hope you hang around New York a while . If you did n't live next door I do n't suppose I 'd ever get near a bottle of Scotch . I do n't suppose I 'd ever get a chance to break the monotony . Tell me about Hollywood , will you , Phil ?
