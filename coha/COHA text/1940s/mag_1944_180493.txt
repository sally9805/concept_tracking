Last December Lieut . General Andrew G. L. McNaughton resigned as commander of Canada 's overseas armies and came home . Last week at 57 , after 34 years of soldiering , he asked to be retired from the Army . The National Defense Ministry was almost effusive : " Canada will be forever grateful . " Then it upped Andy McNaughton to the rank of full General , * gave him an estimated $12,000 yearly retirement pay . <P> No one had yet told , out loud , the real reason why General McNaughton had resigned his overseas command . But last week in his small Ottawa apartment , Andy McNaughton talked . He had resigned his command , he said , because he had wanted to keep his Army , stationed in Britain , intact . The National Defense Ministry , yielding to complaints from impatient Canadians , decided to divide the Army , send a corps to Italy to fight . <P> " I still think I was right , " said McNaughton . " It was a terrible mistake to break up the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hold the patience of the country . I know Canadians and I know we could have held their patience and the Army 's as long as necessary . " <P> But the General was not even yet telling all . Said he : " In two minutes I could start a controversy the like of which you have never seen , but I 'm not going to do it . ... I have given every report , every memorandum and every scrap of paper to the historians . Let them write about it 25 years from now . " <P> * The third in Canada 's history . The others : Sir Arthur William Currie , Sir William Dillon Otter , both of World War I.
