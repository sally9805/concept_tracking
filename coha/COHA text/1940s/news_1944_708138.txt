txt Adm . Nimitz , with a sly grin , startled correspondents today by saying , at the end of a press conference : " You might be interested in this communique : " ' Powerful allied naval forces have attacked a portion of the Japanese fleet lying at anchor near the entrance to Fusan harbor on the southeast cost of Korea . Twentysix of approximately 80 ships present in the harbor were set afire and the remainder dispersed . " ' In a later engagement , more than 70 Japanese vessels , including warships and transports , were encountered by the allied fleet and sunk . The devastating blow has isolated enemy armies in Korea and cut them off from their home bases . ' " The admiral added , " This communique , incidentally , is dated late June , 1592 . It shows the weather long ago aided in the defense of Japan . Kublai Khan twice almost invaded Japan , only to have his ships destroyed by gales . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
