The Navy was preparing another sidereal promotion list : as a result of the new five-star rank , which lifts the whole naval ceiling , some admirals were due to be boosted a little higher . But nowhere on the star-spangled list was there the name of a naval aviator . Nor , probably , would there be . Airmen were still the Navy 's younger sons . <P> Naval aviators thought they knew precisely whom to blame for this slight . Never in public , but frequently in tight-lipped private conversation , they have pointed the finger at Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King , boss of everything which flies , or floats or walks or rolls under Navy insignia . " Ernie " ' King , they feel , has never given aviation the recognition it rates as the punch of the modern U.S. Navy . <P> Though Admiral King himself wears the wings of a naval aviator ( won at 48 ) , airmen point out that it has been a long time since he has flown a plane ; to naval air 's young Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> As one piece of evidence , they point to the make-up of his general staff . The nearest thing to an aviator among the higher-ups of King 's general staff is Vice Admiral Frederick J. Home , vice chief of naval operations , who is rated as a naval observer ( strictly a nonpilot ) . <P> In nonflying Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz ' Pacific Fleet , the policy is for top nonflying combat admirals to have airmen chiefs of staff. * Except for their comparatively low rank ( which is Admiral King 's affair ) , naval flyers in the Pacific have hardly a complaint . <P> The Army Way . When they see the prestige enjoyed by flyers in the Army , and reflect on Admiral King 's insistence on seniority in promotion ( which is tough on younger flying officers ) , naval airmen grow even hotter under the collar . Among top-rankers on General Marshall 's staff is the Air Forces ' Major General Clayton L. Bissell , acting chief of G2 . Another airman , Lieut . General Joseph T. McNarney , was Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Air Forcemen agree that the only reason there are not more airmen on the Army general staff today is that General " Hap " Arnold has not been able to release enough starred officers from his busy air forces . Marshall 's fixed policy is to make the ratio of top air general officers and ground officers equal . <P> And although there were no airmen on the Army 's promotion list last week either , the omission was only temporary . Army airmen were confident that they would continue to get the Ground Army 's recognition . None had forgotten that George Marshall 's recognition of the importance of the Air Forces has given the outfit a unique autonomy , and had even started Hap Arnold up to his five-star rank . <P> <P> * And vice versa : flying admirals have non-flying chiefs of staff .
