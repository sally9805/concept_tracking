U.S. soldiers will vote in 1944 . <P> When an uneasy Senate windily debated the soldier vote last month , both parties were politicking furiously ( TiME , Dec. 13 ) . New Dealers stubbornly pushed the Lucas-Green measure , which would have set up a super-powerful Federal War Ballot Commission . On the side , they suspected that servicemen would vote for the Commander in Chief . Republicans stubbornly fought beside conservative Democrats for States ' rights. * The anti-New Deal coalition killed the bill and substituted a pious , meaningless resolution which threw the whole problem back at the States . On their side , GOPsters succeeded in delivering a humiliating defeat to the Administration . <P> A sobered Congress came back to work this week , ready to listen to any reasonable compromise . They had had their say . More important , they had had a good long talk with the folks back home . The soldiers must vote . Three events speeded the new reasonableness : <P> Navy Secretary Frank Knox and War Secretary Henry Stimson wrote a joint letter to the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual States could not handle the complex job of polling servicemen : " The War &; Navy Departments do not advocate or oppose any particular voting legislation . . . . But the Services are unable effectively to administer the diverse procedures of 48 States as to 11,000,000 servicemen all over the world in primary , special and general elections . " <P> The Algiers edition of Stars &; Stripes , the Army 's overseas newspaper , polled its readers , found that 100% felt strongly about their right to vote . Forty-two servicemen readers from 42 States were specific about it : " Give us a chance to vote the easy way and not leave us to the individual States with their inadequate laws and delaying difficulties . " <P> State legislatures , egged on by an aroused nation to take action-any action - met in haste . Georgia and West Virginia speedily passed soldier vote measures . The legislatures of Connecticut , Colorado , Illinois , Iowa , Michigan and Wisconsin called special January sessions . Arkansas nervously dusted off a 1923 law abolishing the poll tax for soldiers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme for mailing postcards to servicemen overseas . <P> Whether the special bills , schemes , promises and bustling in State capitals could solve the problem or not ( the Army &; Navy plainly thought not ) , the worrywart frenzy of state activity was a symptom of the nation 's temper . In blunt words , voters had told their legislators-both state and national-that something must be done . <P> Something Will Be Done . Back to Capitol Hill came Illinois 's Scott Lucas with a rewritten version of the bill which he stubbornly defended for six days last month . He was now ready to be sweetly reasonable toward the equally stubborn Republicans who had fought his bill . This time , Senator Lucas felt , he had a measure to resolve all objections . His would-be Federal War Ballot Commission need not infringe on States ' rights . Acting as a mere administrative office for the Army &; Navy , the Commission could send out ballots , collect them , and pass them along to the states for counting .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
