" Reads Radio Address . Senator Wheeler interrupted Tat to read a newspaper account of a radio address by Fulton Lewis Jr . over the Mutual system last night . The radio broadcast quoted Pepper as frankly advocating totalitarian powers for President Roosevelt and as stating that other New Dealers subscribed to his views . The radio broadcast also referred to an incident at the Democratic national convention in Chicago , when Senator Wheeler was supposed to have accused Pepper of wanting to make the President a dictator . When Pepper told the senate that he had no recollection of the inci ? dent , Wheeler gave his version al what happened . There had been a violent controversy at a meeting of the Platform committee in the Black . stone hotel , according to Wheeler . When he and Pepper walked out of the committee room into the corridor , Wheeler said , he turned to Pep . per and remarked : " You are proposing to make the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As I recall it , " Wheeler continued , " the senator from Florida replied : ' Only temporarily . ' " When Pepper insisted that he did not recall making any such statement , Wheeler said : " I do not think I was casting a reflection or intended to cast a reflection upon the senator . But if he says to me that he did not make the statement , I would have to say that my recollection was that the conversation took place . " Pepper did not repudiate the radio broadcast in which he Was quoted as advocating totalitarian powers for the President . He said there were some slight inaccuracies , but ' that the proposal attributed to him was not dis . similar to the seven point program he advocated in the senate on June 17 . Reads from Record . Senator Wheeler thereupon produced the Congressional Record and began reading from Pepper 's June 17 speech , as follows : " First . Confer upon the President I full wartime power to prepare and defend America . " Second . Universal defense serv- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained and placed for the country 's defense . " Third . Confer upon the President the power to suspend all rules , regulations , and statutes  --  including army , ' navy , and departmental seniority regulations  --  which , in his judgment , interfere with maximum speed in the production , transportation or manufacture of defense materials . " Fourth . Confer upon the President power to suspend the present debt limitation if in his judgment such limitation interferes with the maximum speed of the defense program . " Fifth .. Grant the President the authority to aid , in materials or credit , those countries and nations which in his judgment at this time constitute America 's first line of defense . " Sixth . The President and the congress to begin immediately the preparation and the adoption of a defense budget and a tax program ade . quate for the national defense . " Seventh . Confer upon the President the power to take into custody for the duration of the defense effort all aliens whose freedom would in his opinion , jeopardize the defense program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulity when the subject of giving the President power to suspend all laws was mentioned . " That is an illimitable power , " he said . " The President has some constitutional powers , but that would absolutely junk the constitution if he could set aside every law in the country . Assuming that he might use his best judgment , that is a power never before granted any president in the history of the country . " Senator Clark remarked that the Weimar constitution of the German republic contained a provision for the suspension of laws and assumption of dictatorship in case of emergency . " I was just going to ask the senator , " Clark said , " what happened to Germany and to the world when , under Chancellor Hitler , that provision of the Weimar constitution was put into effect , and all laws were suspended , and Germany went to government by decree , which , as I understand the seven-point program of the senator from Florida , is what he is advocating  --  suspension of all laws on decree of the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provision into effect ? " Defends Hitler 's Position . Senator Carl A. Hatch D. , N. M. interrupted , saying he had put the Weimar constitution into the record and that it showed , to his satisfaction , " that rise to power was perfectly constitutional under the German constitution . " " That , " said Senator Clark , " is the reason why I oppose so bitterly any step leading toward the establishment of a dictatorship in the United States , by constitutional means or unconstitutional means . " It is frequently said that the Roman republic in times of danger and stress was in the habit of establishing a dictatorship . That , indeed , is true , and perhaps that worked well for a while . But one sorry ' day there came a time when a dictator did not turn back his power when the emergency was over , and the Roman republic was at an end , and I do not wish to see the American republic go the same way .
