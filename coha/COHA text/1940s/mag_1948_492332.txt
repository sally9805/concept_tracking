each month for thirty-five years to pay the premium on that annuity policy . We ca n't paint , we ca n't write stories , fix watches or teach music ; as doctors , we could handle sick folks and play a duffer game of golf , and we found in these last few years that our most pleasant occupation was sitting on the clubhouse porch with something cool to drink and " buzz and buzz and tell what a man we used to wuz . " You ca n't even do that on $150 a month . So I went to farming . This is not the usual back-to-the-land saga , telling of all the hardships we went through together . I have read dozens of books and articles of the type written by some loving wife who rushed to the wilds with her mate and worked with him shoulder to shoulder in building their little nine-room-andthree-bath house from timbers and stones they had gathered themselves and erected with their own hands  --  stopping , after each atone and timber was in place , to admire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to enjoy life in the raw with that noble he-man of a husband . I do believe that there are such women , for I saw one once ; I said once . In thirty years of dealing mostly with the fair sex , I saw one woman who claimed she would do it , and who sounded as if she meant it . One night when I was an intern in a Salt Lake City hospital , I was called to care for an emergency case in which a woman had shot and killed her boy friend , wounded his other girl friend and then tried to finish herself . As usual , her aim was bad when it came to self-destruction , and she was not badly hurt . Being young and curious as to the way a woman 's heart works when she is in love , I asked for her story . She told it in great detail . She had shot him because she loved him and could not bear to see the other girl get him . She wound up her tale with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honest , I loved him so much that I 'd even have moved on , a homestead with him if he 'd asked me to . " Later , after thirty years ' practice on the deserts of Utah , 1 realized that there was no greater love for a man than this . But it is the rare female who , unless she was raised on a ranch , can go native and stick with it long enough to write even a short book . She is more likely to take a pot shot at the old man  --  after she has been there a year or two and developed that inevitable case of cabin fever . With her man itis different ; he is a savage anyhow , and would still be living in a cave if it were not for her influence . I have now been on a farm for more than two years , and I started with no knowledge whatever . I had never been of a mechanical turn of mind or paid any attention to the usual household emergencies . There was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly do what work was needed in payment . Before I moved , I went to a dairy , and the milker let me milk an old cow that they kept just to feed the calves . I milked her six times and graduated  --  I thought  --  an efficient milker . I bought a couple of books on gentleman farming , both of them packed with food chemistry , vitamins and protein content of various grain mixtures . I never have got around to reading them . I buy my mash ready-mixed and let the miller worry about the percentages ; he is required by law to show the protein content on the sack . As for vitamins , the cow probably knows as much about them as the medical profession , anyway , and she can secure her own in her own way , as generations of cows have done before her , for she , like her ancestors , has six acres of virgin forest to roam in and has a wide choice of foodstuffs . Loafing Like Sixty T HE day I became sixty , I handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of medicine to others who retained more of the enthusiasm of youth . In order not to get weak in the knees and break my good resolutions , I moved to a strange community and pledged myself not to enter a physician 's office nor talk shop for at least one year . It worked ; in that one year I was cured , and can now walk into a hospital and feel as strange as a cat in a new house . I attended the meetings of the American Medical Association in San Francisco and was terribly bored by the proceedings . But , man , you should see me at a Farm Bureau meeting ! I am one eager beaver there . I have never attended a Farm Bureau meeting without learning something worth while . I can not say that about all the medical meetings I have listened to in the last thirty years . I knew that to achieve complete separation from my former occupation I would have to leave my patients as well as my colleagues . It is not easy to PHOTOGRAPHY BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunts ; one does not form new friends as quickly at sixty as at thirty . However , I had planned this move almost from intern days . I remember that a rising young surgeon and I were in the chart room one morning , kidding a couple of good-looking nurses , when an old sourpuss of a chief of service , fully sixty years old , dropped in unexpectedly and gave us a lecture on how to conduct ourselves in our relations with our sister profession . We took it like good soldiers , but after he left we made a pledge that when we were sixty we would retire , and not clutter up the hospitals with a couple of old crabs whose chief joy would be to take the fun out of some future intern 's life . My fellow doctor forgot that pledge , and at sixty-two was gathered to his reward by the coronary route after a year of invalidism . I remembered , and at sixty-two I am a farmer , and expect to hang around for seven or eight more years , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my cow and chickens than he is with his harp and wings . Ruth and I had looked over the West Coast and Arizona carefully every vacation for the last fifteen years . We had lived too long with the Rocky Mountains to the east of us ever to be happy again in the Middle West or East  --  which often reminded me of a remark a man had made to me many years ago on my first trip west . " Young man , " he said , " if you ever expect to be happy east of the Rocky Mountains , do n't stay west of them for over three months . " He was right  --  and so our quest was narrowed down to four states . Our final choice , for many reasons , was in the foothill region of the Sierra Nevadas . No place is perfect , and moving around is expensive , so it 's best to be sure that you are in the right spot before you take root . I have listed what I considered the advantages and disadvantages of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man in picking out his future home . ADVANTAGE9 1 . Plenty of irrigation water at moderate cost . Utah , Arizona and Nevada never have enough water . 2 . Moderate climate ; temperature seldom goes below twenty-five degrees above zero in winter , summer days up in the nineties , but the nights always down to sixty-five . ( Continued on Page 86 ) THE RIMY EVENING POST a pretty rnvino end some nice timber , Last season I produced Ism tons of hny , doing nil the work with my tractor except cutting ; the grass grew so rank that my Mil lo machine could pint handle it . it civet $2.50 for seed and $5.00 for cutting . Hay on the market is thirty-five dollars per ton . I paid $150 for my cow two years ago . She is not a record breaker as to milk  --  lest year she gave 5500 pounds ; she weighs only 800 herself  --  but she is as gentle as n dog and never tries to break out , of her pasture ; she lets Ruth or me do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call her name . We feed her four pounds of mash ii day and sell two quarts of rich Jersey milk to a neighbor , which more than pays for the mash ten months out of t he year , The annual calf sells for enough to pay for the rest of it . It takes me twenty minutes , night and morning , to care for her and milk her , and to feed the chickens . My cow has running water to drink and can get hay whenever she wants it . In fact , she is the only cow 1 ever heard of that has a suite of three rooms and uses them all . When I first got her , I ? locked her in the shed , built for the ? trailer and garden tractor , to keep her from wandering off . After I turned her out , she continued to go hack there to sleep , and as there was plenty of room , I did not object . She still uses it , but ? only for sleeping , and seldom messes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oftener than once a month . Next is the milkshed where she gets ber mash ; that is painted white and has a concrete floor and electric lights . She is allowed in there only during milking . The third room is her loafing room , or , as the Army would call it , her day ' room . There is an overhead manger that connects with the hayloft. by a chute , so that as she eats the hay , more falls down in the manger . About once a week I go to the loft and throw some more hay into the chute . I have to police this shed every day in winter , as she loafs there when it is raining . Lumber for all this cost only fifty dollars , and I had the fun of building it myself . If anyone has a cheaper or easier way to secure half his living  --  namely , milk , cream , butter , cheese , to say nothing of garden fertilizer  --  I would like to hear about it . We use two and a hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad stomach , a hang-over of my years of active practice and worry , I consume a gallon of milk each day myself . Our neighbor is happy to come for his portion , not because of any reduced price , but because of the richness and the fact that he knows the cow has passed every test the vet could think of and that I use every precaution to produce clean milk , Who would n't when he drinks half of it himself ? The ulcer diet also requires lots of eggs ; therefore the chicken house is next in importance . We keep a dozen hens , feed them nothing but prepared mash and scratch feed , and allow them two hours ' run on the clover pasture every evening for green feed . I buy twenty-five baby chickens in March at about eighteen cents each , brood them under an ordinary electric-light globe at a total power cost of about $2.50 for the season , kill off all but the six best-looking pullets for food and , when they start to lay in September , sell off six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the others molt . In two years we have never purchased an egg and have sold the surplus for enough to buy 75 per cent of the chicken feed . I have never lost a baby chick , and have gathered less than four eggs per day only twice since I started . I raise New Hampshire Reds , as they are the color of the soil , and the hawks do not bother them . They use about six dollars ' worth of feed per month , and with eggs at the present price it is easy to sell that many and still keep the egg basket in the refrigerator full . I have running water in the yards , so that cleaning the dropping boards and spreading the droppings on the flower garden consumes about twenty minutes once a week . However , I know that if I had very many hens-300 , for instance  --  I could not equal that record , because a dozen chickens well cared for in a large coop will give the best results in I he chicken business . Thus the items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house as the result , of less than an hour 's work a day , and at little or no outlay of money , to say nothing of their superior freshness and quality . If we were heavy meat eaters , we would put in a freezer and raise a lamb or two . We would have plenty of milk and pasture for I hem . However , I have trouble enough chopping t he heads off the chickens . and I 'm afraid I 'd never be able to kill a pet lamb or calf , much less eat him . The garden is the only real chore ; you plant peas in August to eat in November , plant in November to eat in March and in January to eat in April . It 's the same with everything else ; you plant broccoli , lettuce , turnips , chard , spinach , Chinese cabbage and carrots in September and eat them from December until spring ; you plow up the residue and plant a spring garden in the same place in April to eat all summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We eat all we want from April fifteenth to October fifteenth and preserve plenty for the rest of the year . Tomatoes and beans last from ' June to November , and everything grows and hears well if you care for it , except Irish potatoes . We have so much fruit that the birds wo n't even eat strawberries , and what you do n't raise yourself the neighbors give you . And that , for that matter , is the only way to get it , for the stores do not handle much fruit ; due , I suppose , to the fact that none of the natives need to buy any . The tourist can secure it at fruit stands at about 300 per cent of the ranch price . This year I had melons , squash , straw-boysenberries and red raspberries , apricots , nectarines , cactus artichokes , almonds , figs , olives , walnuts , grapefruit , oranges , lemons , apples and peaches ; and there is an orchard of twenty acres of plums joining me on the east . There are twenty-five varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the owner has invited us to help ourselves . At the present high prices , our grocery bill never exceeds thirty dollars a month . Our electric bill averages ten dollars a month ; we use electricity to cook and heat water and in workshop , barn and chicken coops . Our telephone costs us $3.50 a month , and oil for the furnace comes to about fifty dollars a year . Our taxes average seventy-five dollars a year and water costs fifty-five dollars per year for an inch continuous flow . An inch of water will irrigate seven acres of land . Our greatest worry is fire , as we live two miles from town and this country suffers many forest fires , mostly on account of the carelessness of cigarette smokers . I may have sounded so far as if I have to do a lot of work , but I have 88 kept rigidly to my planned schedule : work three hours a day and no more  --  unless I am helping someone else . That is enough to keep a man in good shape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial situation permitted , I would probably spend that much time on the golf course each day and have nothing to show for it but red ink on my daily ledger . People in this country have a quaint old custom of helping each other , so , when I build a shed or put in some fence , my neighbor comes over and helps , and I return the favor at any time . We build our own houses , do our own painting and plumbing , and call for help only when plastering is in order . I know the following statement sounds foolish , but it is the honest truth : I know a farmer who built a five-room-and-bath frame house this summer for $2200 , for which he has since been offered $7000 . Of course , the cost did not include the work of his neighbors nor his own . In summer I get up at five A.M. , do my chores and loaf until breakfast at seven A.M. , smoke and listen to the news broadcast until eight , work until ten , then drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep for an hour or two . In the afternoon I read an hour or two and work an hour again from five to six . After the evening meal there are the usual diversions  --  picture shows , visiting with the neighbors , lodge meetings and such . Mostly , however , we spend our evenings sitting on the lawn , watching the sun set and listening to the vesper sparrows singing their goodnight song . I follow the example of the sun and in winter do n't arise until seven or later , and , as the weather is always warm enough to work outdoors in comfort , I put in my two hours cutting brush , unless it is raining . In that case , I have a workshop with a few power tools in my barn , and can spend the time there repairing tools or trying my hand at cabinet work . There is also a small room in the garage building which is fitted up as my office . It contains a year 's accumulation of medical journals and books which I have saved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago a friend gave me a book on the identification of birds , and this has been the start of a growing hobby that may interfere with some of my planned reading and other work . I have shot every cat that has come on the place , put up some birdhouses and am gradually gaining the confidence of our January 17,1943 feathered friends . . . as well as that of 500 mice . We are now on rather intimate terms with a pair of phoebes ; they are raising their family by the kitchen window ; and a few days ago a brown towhee hopped up to my chair on the lawn and tried to remove my shoelace , thinking , I suppose , that it was a worm . The biggest thrill is to see Mrs. Quail marching along with fifteen or twenty mouse-sized babies following , and father bringing up the rear , as proud as a king and as watchful as his position and responsibilities require . I 've also heard the eagle scream , and not on the Fourth of July , either . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the spring , when even the eagles get foolish , they put on quite an act for us . The lady flies lazily around over the valley , and the male rises high in the heavens and then dive-bombs her , coming down like a P-38 , his wings close to his body , to within about . twenty feet of her . Then he levels off and makes a large circle around her . While diving , he lets out a note that sounds like a cross between a sawmill cutting a knotty log and two tomcats arguing over politics . It is the most penetrating and wild note I have ever heard . He 's a tough baby , all right , but how I do envy him his mastery of his domain and his general wildness . What a satisfaction it would be to be able to howl at the top of your voice whenever you felt like it , and know that no one could restrict your right to do so ! But , you say , what are you accomplishing ? Frankly , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in that time I think my debt to the community was paid . I served in one war and sent both my sons to the next one , ; attended the arrival of 2500 newborn Americans and listened for thousands of hours to humanity 's hopes and fears ; and I expect I have heard more confessions of human cussedness than many priests . Now I am engaged in trying to produce the raw materials that my family may consume , thus relieving the drain on the public larder by three , improving ten acres of God 's footstool and making it serve the wants of man as was intended in the great scheme of things . And though at times the way seems rough and we are lonesome for the life we once led , we are using as our text that simple little prescription for happiness that St. Paul gave so long ago : " For I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
