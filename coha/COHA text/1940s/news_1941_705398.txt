txt " Disgusted With Labor " It is practically impossible to pick up a newspaper without reading of new strikes in defense industries . Is this the manner in which the Administration and the American people try to rush aid to Britain ? I can not speak for the former , but every one I have spoken to is thoroughly disgusted with labor . There is an old saying : " The pendulum always swings too far , " and the foolish policy of labor will some day cause it to lose all that it has so painfully gained in the past few years . There are thousands of other Americans in a position similar to mine . Next month I am giving up a $5,000 a year , job to join the Army at $21 a month . I am a volunteer , although that is not important . Nevertheless , can we be blamed for becoming a bit fed up with strikes in our factories ? EDWARD P. FIELD Jr .
