txt There is a new mood visible in Washington today ; it is a mood of quiet optimism that peace is getting within reach . This does n't mean that anybody in the government believes that the United States can safely drop its guard . It does mean that those who are closest to the facts feel more confident that the ingredients of a working agreement with Russia are in the making . Recent public statements by both Secretary of State Dean Acheson and ' Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson both expressed this mood . Mr. Acheson gave it as his considered judgment that the North Atlantic Security Pact would help create an atmosphere which would promote a settlement between the Soviet Union and the West . Secretary Johnson , speaking in behalf of himself and the joint chiefs of staff  --  General Eisenhower , General Bradley . General Vandenberg , Admiral Denfeld ? reported that all were convinced that the danger of war has lessened . Obviously , none in the government is ' loser to the military problem and the military danger than these four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after assessing all risks , that the probability of war is less , the possibility of peace greater , than for some time . Behind these words from Secretaries Acheson and Johnson is a cautious , restrained , but heartening judgment . It does not rest on wishful thinking . It does not rest on the view that Soviet communism is suddenly going to alter its objective , which is the revolutionary overthrow of everything unlike itself . It rests on the conviction that the western democracies are daily gaining strength and unity ; that when Moscow finds it can not win through western weakness it will be more disposed to make peace with western strength . A A A Numerous factors contribute to this improved outlook . Despite setbacks in China , Greece , Germany . Korea , it is evident by now that American foreign policy is producing vastly more profit than loss . The profit is that the danger of a shooting war is measurably less today and the prospects of an equilibrium with Russia is measurably better than at any time since the Big Four agreements at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this end are these : 1 . The dispatch of American naval power to the Mediterranean when Moscow was putting pressure on Turkey . 2 . American aid to Greece , which , despite its shortcomings and its headaches , has preserved Greek independence . 3 . The daring , imaginative concept of the Marshall Plan , which is steadily bringing the 16 participating nations of Europe back onto their feet and which is promoting the beginnings of European federation . 4 . America 's own considerable rearmament and its willingness to accept the financial burden of such rearmament . These have shown to Europe and to Russia that the United States does not intend to retire into another postwar isolationism and is prepared to defend the common peace . 5 . Finally , the North Atlan- tic Security Pact is the culmination of western diplomatic unity . It virtually precludes the danger of " divide and conquer . ' It gives to western Europe and the Western Hemisphere an indivisible security . It serves notice upon any potential aggressor that no single small nation can be attacked without encountering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A A A It will be surprising to no one in Washington to find the Soviet Union offering new proposals to settle outstanding East-West differences . There probably will be inspired cables which will allege that western diplomats are spurning these . offers . Experience shows that these are the usual preliminaries to reopening negotiations . It would be well to discount any report of Washington or London or Paris spurning Soviet willingness to talk unless the report identifies the source of the news . It might be noted that in the next-to-last meeting . of the United Nations General Assembly , American delegates approached individual Russian delegates 35 times on various issues , and that at the recent Paris ? session the number of approaches initiated by Americans totaled 150 . No Russian delegate initiated discussions with an American representative at any time at either meeting . The need is to begin negotiations in those agencies of the UN where issues are deadlocked , not just to begin talking about beginning them . A dozen doors are open .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
