The auxiliary sloop Linda was short and squat and broad of beam , and neither spic nor span as she cut a bow wave through Miami 's gilt-edged Biscayne Bay last week . Nonetheless , she was a proud ship . She had borne 18 Estonians , storm-tossed on the dirty seas of Europe 's politics , across an equally turbulent ocean to haven in a free land . There was a not-so-proud moment when the Linda ran aground off Quarantine , and hung there high &; dry until the tide refloated her . Soon she was tied up in a nest with two sister craft which had ended the same daring voyage within the previous month . <P> To Captain Walter Rull , 30 , and his passengers ( twelve men , five women ) , immigration authorities made the now-standard announcement : since none of the voyagers had an immigration visa , they could not enter the U.S. They were shepherded to a warehouse on Miami 's Municipal Pier 2 . Cots and food were donated by well-wishers . There the voyagers made themselves at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed from the Inanda and the Brill . For the time being , they seemed patient . <P> No Beachhead . There was free legal talent to help them , but there was no assurance they would be allowed to settle in the U.S. They were only a handful of the millions of displaced persons in Europe . They were agreed on two basic points : 1 ) they had lived under both Russian oppression ( 1940-41 ) and German ( 1941-44 ) , saw little difference between them ; 2 ) they wanted to get into the U.S. <P> But Estonia 's annual quota of 116 immigrants was already filled and there was a long waiting list . Captain Rull and his pilgrims must wait in their warehouse while lawyers appealed to Washington on the grounds of " humanity and public opinion . " The law was tightly drawn , designed to be narrowly construed . It would be hard to find a loophole . <P> When Congress reconvened in January it would be asked to liberalize the law , at least to strike out some of the legal quirks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible immigrants . Meanwhile , the Estonians would get to know their warehouse well .
