txt CITY TRAFFIC PLAN MEETS OPPOSITION IN MANY QUARTERS Neighborhood Civic Groups to Fight Its Priority Over Schools and Hospitals MERCHANTS SEE FLAWS Bus Concern Assails One-Way Avenues  --  Program Approved by Board of Trade By JOSEPH C. INGRAHAM Opposition to a large part of the City Planning Commission 's $125 , - 000,000 plan to ease traffic congestion in New York was voiced here yesterday . Neighborhood civic groups promised a last-ditch fight if the ten-point program got priority over school , hospital and other local improvements . It was disclosed that the Board of Estimate would meet in executive session on Wednesday to consider some of the plan 's major features , only part of which involves the immediate outlay of any city funds . While the New York Board of Trade praised the plan as " comprehensive and practical " and said it hoped the report would get speedy attention , other large trade and civic groups refused to comment pending a study of the program . Objections by Business Men However , some business leaders found certain features objectionable . Merchants on Thirty-fourth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated express highway across Manhattan at Thirtieth Street should be shifted four blocks north . The commission 's unanimous recommendation that Eighth and Ninth Avenues be restricted to oneway traffic also drew the fire of the Eighth Avenue Coach company , which operates on those thoroughfares . It indicated that it would go to court again to preserve the value of its franchise , a move that was successful in 1938 when a similar regulation was attempted by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia . In a separate opinion , Newbold Morris , City Planning Commissioner , noted that " the franchise involved comes up for renewal soon and the change could be made then without danger that it could be invalidated a second time . " The bus company said Mr. Morris was in error and that the franchise was // renewed for ten years last Dec. 28 , the city 's share being increased from 3 to 10 per cent of the gross revenue . The only way the city could invalidate the franchise , a company official said , was for it to invoke the recapture clause that provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb. 1 in the ten-year period . The Automobile Club of New York also condemned the plan as " entirely inadequate because of its failure to provide any immediate remedy to the problems of New York City 's traffic . " Noting that the traffic survey was the fifty-first in thirty-nine years , the club said the planning body " is conspicuous in its failure to arrive at a satisfactory answer to the problems of providing a continuous and smooth flow of traffic and how to provide off-street parking facilities for at least 15,000 more cars a day in midtown Manhattan . " It also scored the commission for failing to recommend methods of regulating truck traffic " which creates the greatest amount of congestion . " " Perhaps the most glaring omission is its failure to comment on the need for an unbiased , competent and non-political Over-all Traffic Authority to ' control all matters relating to traffic , " the lub added .

Other matters that the board viii consider include the proposed Thirtieth Street crosstown expressway , the widening of Second Aveme from East Thirtieth Street forth to East Fifty-ninth Street and altering the Manhattan approaches to the Queensboro Bridge . f the board decides to approve these items it will be necessary to include nominal funds for their design and mapping in the 1947 capital outlay budget .

The tunnel project will be started first , the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority said . Situated north of Battery Park between Washington and Greenwich Streets , it is to be set on land acquired by the city at a cost of $500,000 . The plans and specifications have been completed with funds advanced to the authority by the State and will be built by the authority " as soon as it can be financed . " The plans call for a seven-story structure , open on the sides , with the floors reached by ramps . It will accommodate 1,050 cars at one time and will cost $3,000,000 . The authority also said it was negotiating with various companies for the lease of the structure and the revenue thus derived would be sufficient to guarantee interest and amortization of a bond issue of $3,250,000 .

" Investigations made to date indicate that most projects will require substantial subsidies , " it was added . Mayor O'Dwyer was noncommittal on the plan , asserting that he had not had time to study it . There were indications that the commission 's proposals on bug terminals also would feet opposition . Operators involved in the suggestions for dealing with that complicated traffic problem said they still were studying the report and expected to formulate counter proposals for presentation to the Board of Estimate . The commission 's decision to reject the recommendations of engineering consultants for the establishment of four bus terminals on the West Side of Manhattan was praised by Howard S. Cullman , chairman of the Port of New York Authority . The authority has favored one central terminal west of Eighth Avenue in an effort to remove inter-city buses from midtown . In concurring with the findings of most of the commission , Mr. Cullman termed the recommendation of the consultants " specious , impractical and serving private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
