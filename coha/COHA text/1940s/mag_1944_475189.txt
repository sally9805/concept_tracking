1800 all roads led to Philadelphia . It was the largest of the American towns ; indeed , at the time of the Revolution it had been in size the second city of the British Empire . Philadelphia was also the gateway of the West , the starting point for Western traffic ; and Bar-tram 's Garden , facing the Schuylkill , a favored resort of writers and artists , was a microcosm of the wilderness beyond the mountains . There grew and bloomed the plants and trees that had been gathered by the Bar-trams , the Quaker botanists , John and his son William , on their wide-ranging tours of the prairie and the forest ; and there one met the naturalists and the explorers who were drawn to Philadelphia as the center of thought . Buffon and Linnus had a great following in the country , for the study of natural history was a rage of the time ; and Frenchmen , Swedes , and Germans had hastened to America in search of these great new provinces to be conquered for science . At Bartram 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out to explore , the savannahs of Georgia , the Florida rivers , the far-flung Mississippi Valley ; and they also found a master there with whom they could discuss their discoveries and trophies . William Bartram , a painter of flora and fauna , presided over the garden , his birthplace and home . Too frail to travel any longer , for he was in his early sixties , he had been more adventurous even than his father . He had accompanied John Bar-tram on many of his journeys ? in the Catskills , for instance , when he was a boy ? and the two had gone to Florida together , where they had explored the St. John 's River . This was in 1766 , and William had remained on the river as an indigo planter . Later , in 1773 , he had returned to this earthly paradise ? for so it seemed to both the Bartrams whcrc he lived five years off and on . He had ridden on horseback from Savannah , exploring Georgia also and pushing on to Alabama and the banks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient towns , while he encountered all manner of adventures in the woods . He had met a famous Indian murderer who had taken oath to kill the first white man he could find , and Bartram , who was unarmed at the moment , advanced and held his hand out , and the Indian , surprised , made friends with him . He had met the Little Carpenter , the emperor of the Cherokees , on a grand progress to Charleston , with his following , through the forest . Bartram stepped out of the path and saluted him gravely , and the chief , with splendid courtesy , shook his hand . He had visited planters , reclining on bearskins , on the banks of flowery streams , with whom he dined on venison , honey , and brandy under the live-oak trees . He was present at Indian councils , with Seminoles and Creeks ? among whom he was known as Puc-Puggy , the flowerhunter ? dances of Cherokee maidens and Seminole feasts . He sometimes joined a company of traders , but mostly , during these years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mooring his bark and spreading his skins , under some hospitable oak , in a fragrant grove . Every night beside the fire he had jotted down the day 's events in a record of these excursions in the land of flowers . He had watched a flock of parakeets hovering and fluttering in a swamp that was alive with otters , snakes , and frogs , where the long moss waved from the snags of the trees ; or he was enthralled by the whooping cranes , the squealing water hens , or the mockingbirds in a towering magnolia tree . This native sylvan music , flooding the still evening air , soothed and charmed his car while his eye was filled with the colors of the sunset streaking the embroidered savannahs . He had encountered a rattlesnake , with eyes red as burning coals , whirring its tail so rapidly that it looked like vapor , while its body swelled with rage , rising and failing , suggesting a bellows , and its parti-colored skin became speckled and rough and it brandished a forked tongue that might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagoon a sudden battle of alligators , rushing forth in combat from the flags and reeds , while cataracts of water fell from their jaws and the earth trembled with their thunder . Or he had sailed day after day over the crystal springs , with innumerable squadrons of fish floating beneath him , distinctly seen through the pellucid water , descending into caverns measureless to man , secret meandering rivers and fathomless fountains . Numbers of these images , which appeared in Bartram 's Travels , reappeared in some of the world 's great poems ; for when the book was published , in 1791 , it opened a new scene for romancers and poets . It passed into the mind of Coleridge , whence it re-emerged in two or three splendid passages of Kubla Khan , There one found the jetting fountains and the incense-bearing trees , together with other reminders of the Isle of Palms ; and Bartram 's wondrous fishes , attired in gold , red , blue , and green , appeared in The Ancient Mariner as water snakes . Wordsworth , too , read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his poems , the green savannahs , the endless lakes , the fair trees , the gorgeous flowers , the magnolias , the azaleas that " set the hills on fire " in Ruth . There one found the Indian maidens gathering strawberries in the wood , while Words-worth 's Prelude also bore traces of Bartram . Campbell 's Gertrude of Wyoming was full of scenes from Bartram , and more than fifty passages in Chateaubriand 's Les Natchez were drawn directly from his pages . When Coleridge and Southey , reading Bartram , thought for a while of leaving England in order to live on the banks of the Susquehanna , they took it for granted that they would find there the scenery , flowers , and birds of Florida . N ONG the visitors at Bartram 's Garden was William Dunlap , the New Yorker , who called upon the naturalist with Charles Brockden Brown . They found him , rake in hand , with his old hat flopping over his face , breaking the clods of earth in a tulip bed . He was dressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with leather strings , and his expression was benign and happy . He talked with the politeness and ease of one of nature 's noblemen . He had kept Alexander Wilson at the Garden for months . This melancholy Scotchman , with the long hooked nose and the dreamy face , whose fame as " the Ornithologist " soon spread through the world , had found in Bartram not only a friend but a careful instructor in drawing and painting . Wilson had made crude drawings as a youth in Scotland . There , as a rebel Paisley weaver , he had been imprisoned and forced to burn some of his satires in the public square , for he was also a poet , and even a good one . Indeed , for many decades he was one of the standard poets of Scotland . He had roamed there as a peddler , with a pack full of muslins , silks , and prints , collecting subscriptions for his poems ; but feeling , as he said , a vague terror in the air , he had made his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a prisoner 's life , Brackenridge , whose Modern Chivalry was the first work that was printed west of the Alleghenies . A poor Scottish boy , like Alexander Wilson , Brackenridge had been brought to this country at five . From a farm in Pennsylvania he had found his way to Princeton , where he had been a classmate of Philip Freneau . An excellent classical scholar , he had written with Freneau in college a long heroic American historical poem , and the two had opened a school in Maryland and both had edited magazines a few years later in Philadelphia . Then Brackenridge had set up as a lawyer in Pittsburgh , where there were hundreds of speculators in Western lands ; and , like David Crockett later , he defended the rights of the small settlers against the claimants who had not cleared the land . An ardent Jeffersonian , he also defended the " whisky boys " in their struggle against Hamilton 's excise law ; for the whisky that was distilled from their grain was their only medium of exchange , and in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the democrat , had no illusions about the people , and because he wished democracy to succeed and endure he wrote the satire Modern Chivalry to point out the follies that might lead to its overthrow and failure . A satire alike on demagogues and ignorant voters , as on dueling , Billingsgate journalism , crudity , pretension , the work was meant to educate the gullible frontier in the interests of honesty , intelligence , wisdom , and learning . And this comic picture of society was as good as its moral . The " lack-learning settlements , " the village fairs and tavern life , were described in a clear , firm , eighteenth-century prose , with the masculine frankness of language that characterized Americans before they began to ask what the neighbors might say . But to be a writer on the frontier was to feel oneself an exile . The types that throve were the heroes of the writers of the future . At Pittsburgh , for twelve years , lived John Chapman of Massachusetts , the well-known " Johnny Apple-seed " of the later stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was working in the shipyards . Chapman , the son of a carpenter , had been a peddler in New England , and he had wandered westward with his pack and his gun , tending orchards on the way . He had stopped for a while at Cooperstown , when Fenimore Cooper was a small boy , and he was to follow the frontier far beyond Pittsburgh . He carried apple seeds from the cider presses , which he planted in Indiana and Ohio , and the wilderness bore flowers and fruit wherever he passed . As the first nurseryman in the Ohio Valley , he became a sort of orchard god , who sowed as he went and vanished at last into the far new West . Others became mythical figures while they were still living . One of these was Mike Fink , whom Chapman knew in Pittsburgh and whom the novelist Brackenridge must have known . Born there in a log cabin , brought up on bear 's meat and venison , this frontier Jack the Giant Killer was " the King of the Keelboat-men . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was supposed to have eaten a buffalo skin . A humorist and a practical joker , he could outrun , outbrag , and outfight all the other salt-river roarers . From the middle of the Mississippi he could shoot the tails off pigs , and he was a champion gouger and the terror of pirates , and his oaths were fireworks of language , bombs and rockets of colored sound . Moreover , as poleman and steersman of keelboats , of which he became the great patroon , he was a wonder-worker in his daring and skill . There was no one like Mike Fink for dodging snags , bars , islands of driftwood or for mastering the wild cross-currents of the Mississippi . He was the forerunner of the race of river pilots whom Mark Twain was to celebrate in after days . PTV-SERE were two thousand miles of river between Pittsburgh and New Orleans , a serpentine whispering gallery of fantasy and rumor ; and there for many years to come tales of border heroes and backwoods Jasons were told by the swaggering boat-men at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers , and so was Simon Kenton , the Ohio scout , the paladin of countless exploits , mythical and real ; while Daniel Boone was already known in Europe . The Kentucky hisdeleted material these towns still belonged to the Louisiana Territory , which became a part of the Union in 1803 ; and meanwhile Kentucky was the most advanced of the Western regions , while Tennessee , on the southern border , was also rapidly taking form . They had both been admitted as states in the seventeen-nineties . Kentucky was the thoroughfare for the northern and western settlement of southern Indiana and Illinois ; and Lexington , with three thousand inhabitants , the largest of the Western towns , was sometimes known already as " the Athens of the West . " There Transylvania University had been established for several years , and there was the oldest Western newspaper and the first Western printing press . This press had been carted over the mountains in 1787 and floated in an ark downriver from Pittsburgh , and copies of the newspaper were distributed by post riders far and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabins , and the news they contained was declaimed from stumps . The editor cut his own illustrations from dogwood . William Wirt , in the British Spy , mourned over the waste of talent in the Western regions , perishing there for want of culture , and indeed , beyond the Bible and rEsop 's Fables , an occasional life of Franklin or The Pilgrim 's Progress , broadcast by the peddlers , hooks were few . But at Lexington one could buy at the bookstore , even before 1800 , not only most of the modern authors but Virgil , Horace , Ovid , and Sallust ; and in the little backwoods papers that appeared in all the surrounding regions there was usually a poets ' corner , " sacred to the Muses . " In Lexington lived Henry Clay , the poor Virginia minister 's son who had worked as a boy in a store at Richmond and who had moved to Kentucky in 1797 . As a clerk in the office of George Wythc , with whom Jefferson also had studied , Clay had grown up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national Senate in 1806 , when the fame of this " Harry of the West " soon spread through the country . The most remarkable man in Kentucky , hot-blooded and warm-hearted , generous , exuberant , gay , with a musical voice , he practiced his oratory in the Lexington cornfields , in the woods , and under the rafters of his big barn . His Tennessee neighbor Andrew Jackson had already been a Senator . He had resigned in 1798 , and he kept a store in Nashville , where he had a plantation . Already a large landowner , and also a radical Jeffersonian , he lived there in a frame house when even the courthouse was a log cabin . A South Carolinian by birth and a natural lover of war and sport , Jackson was a great hand at cards , cockfighting , and raising colts . He was a notable duelist , and this fiery and bellicose man had a passion for the turf ; and he thought nothing of riding to Washington , like many another member of Congress , whether from Georgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was growing up in Tennessee had hunted " varmints " there since the age of six , and after his father gave him a rifle , when he was eight years old , he went without his dinner if he missed his shot . This was David Crockett , the Tennessee Hercules of the future , who was fourteen in 1800 . His father , like Daniel Boone , was a keeper of one of those backwoods taverns where hunters and trappers gathered and swapped their tall tales , and Davy not only became in time a prince of story-tellers but he was a great dancer all his life . What he liked at country frolics was " none of your straddling , mincing , sadying , but a regular sifter , cut-the-buckle , chicken-flutter set-to . " Davy , who had only a few months of schooling , had been bound out to a drover who was taking his cattle over the range . He knew the lonely Blue Ridge trail and had traveled as far as Baltimore , and he was already a champion at shooting matches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the backwoods pioneers who were settling Tennessee and Kentucky . Some of them assumed from instinct the Indian dress and the Indian ways , others for protection , others from choice . They usually wore green hunting shirts with fringes , deerskin moccasins , leggings , and coonskin caps ; and they had pushed out from the Carolinas or down through West Virginia , joining their kinsmen who had crossed the Pennsylvania range . Among them were broken-down aristocrats who were starting life anew in the West and who shared the desire for a proud isolation that characterized the Southern planters ; and , as for the pioneers generally , while many were people of culture and character , others were refugees from Eastern justice . There was one Kentucky county that was called " Rogues ' Harbor , " where murderers , horse thieves , and highway robbers were supposed to have formed a majority . The frontier was tumultuous , and the freedom of this ungoverned country demoralized many an exile from the stable East ; and gouging , gambling , the wildest vice throve in the Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictured as frightful . All this went with a sort of harmless showing off , as if their unbounded freedom had gone to men 's heads , and they leaped on stumps and flapped their arms , crowing in spread-eagle fashion , while they challenged every corner to a fight . Their frolics were uproarious , and the lonely and perilous frontier life was favorable to emotional religion ; and Kentucky was the scene of the first American camp meeting , the Great Revival of 1800 that took place at Cane Ridge . In this world of pioneers who were largely Scotch-Irish by descent , the Presbyterian Church was the cult of the rich , but the Methodists , following the Baptists , appealed to the people , for they preached free will and universal grace . In every sense equalitarians , they spoke to the lowly and outcast also , and the Great Revival continued for several years . A team of preachers came together , as many as twenty or thirty , and preached for four or five days . by day and by night , and sometimes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons assembled in wagons or on horseback , emerging from their tents at the sound of the trumpet . They lighted their way with blazing hickory bark , and the red glare of the campfires was reflected from the tents , surrounded by the blackness of the shadows and the forest ; and one heard the sobs and shrieks of the downcast mingling with the shouts of praise of those who hadcrossed the threshold of the land of Beulah . A hundred victims would fall like dead men under one powerful sermon , while the groans of the " spiritually wounded " echoed through the woods , and three thousand " slain " were laid in rows at the first Cane Ridge meeting in order that they might not be trampled on . The women cast away their lockets , earrings , and gold chains , dropping stiff and bereft of their senses when the preacher pointed his finger at them or felled a group or a crowd with a sweep of his arm . He set them dancing , laughing , barking , and jerking . Sometimes the camp meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dirks , knives , and clubs , who dashed in a wild cavalcade through the worshiping throng . In general , they were " holy fairs , " the great events of rural society throughout the southwestern regions , though less in Ohio . The Yankees , as Peter Cartwright said , did not like loud and zealous sermons , and they brought on their learned preachers to crush the " sons of thunder " and put them to shame . But some of these preachers were mighty men . They were even remarkable writers , too , and a handful of their journals were perhaps the most interesting books that arose from the turbulent Western life of the time . Aside from the dignified Francis Asbury , who disliked all eccentricity , the noble Peter Cartwright was the greatest of them , and they all roamed from region to region , with or without road or path , with stools for chairs and dirt floors for carpets , sleeping on bear and buffalo skins . The oddest and the most notorious was the free-lance Methodist holy man " Crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who jogged on his horse through the rain or trudged on foot , hairy and dirty , with his raiment flapping behind him . By birth a Connecticut Yankee , Lorenzo Dow was a fortune-teller , a miracle-worker , a seer , an interpreter of dreams , who had been converted in 1793 , when he was struck down by a vision of prophets and angels . There was scarcely a Southern hamlet in which a boy did not appear , announcing from his horse that Lorenzo was coming . Then the " eccentric cosmopolite " would emerge from the woods , melancholy , tall , and cadaverous , with his long black cloak and reddish beard and the wild hair streaming over his shoulders . He bore in one hand a staff and a Bible in the other . Meanwhile , Peter Cartwright remained for half a century the most famous and the grandest of the backwoods preachers . This naturally wild and wicked boy , as he called himself in his Autobiography , was converted by a heavenly voice in 1801 . The voice said , " Peter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards and dancing and turned his racehorse over to his father . Then he set out as the " boy preacher , " living on forty dollars a year , with whatever food and clothing his followers gave him . Preaching , along with weightier matters , decency , temperance , and cleanliness , he had the natural eloquence of the prophets of old . Ile suggested to his listeners the cry of the wildcat , the falling of trees in the forest , and the thunderous tread of the buffalo herd on the prairie . This double-barreled " old religion , " as people called it in later years , was to leave profound impressions on the character of the West . Evoked by the life of the pioneers , it expressed the race , the place , the moment ; and its narrowness and grimness , together with its joys and terrors , very largely shaped the Western mind , which remained by turns repressive and explosive . Even five generations later the literature of the Middle West was colored and scarred by the traces of this old religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways by 1800 the forms that later generations knew . The pioneers who crossed the mountains soon lost all recollection of Europe ; they had no sympathy whatever with things European ; and they were defiant equalitarians , sullenly hostile to rank and pretension , who distrusted any kind of special training . Largely , too , they distrusted education , for they connected this with aristocratic ostentation and the claims of superior persons , bosses and snobs . More than a century later one found the remnants of these notions in many of the writers who came from the Middle West ; and other Western traits were clearly established by 1804 , when the Lewis and Clark expedition so greatly extended the content and conception of the West . IV ly TO that time the Mississippi had virtually marked the Western border , but when Jefferson acquired the Louisiana Territory he added to the Union the area of thirteen states . Parts of this country were sparsely peopled by the men who had settled the earlier wilderness , and the French could never have held it against their advance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the mouth of the Mississippi , which controlled the better part of the Western trade . Jefferson had always longed for a closer knowledge of the West ? he had dreamed of carrying the American flag to the Pacific ? and he had suggested expeditions to John Ledyard , Andre Michaux , and George Rogers Clark , which came to nothing . His private secretary Meriwether Lewis already knew much of this farther West when Jefferson obtained the approval of Congress for the great expedition of 1802 . Lewis , the Virginian , went to Philadelphia to prepare for the expedition by a study of science , and he set out in 1803 with a party of forty-five men from Pius-burgh and joined William Clark at Louisville . Clark , a brother of George Rogers Clark , had been a comrade of Lewis in some of the Indian campaigns of Anthony Wayne . A number of Kentuckians , " robust , healthy , hardy young men , " joined the expedition at St. Louis , and they started in May , 1804 , to explore the headwaters of the Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1805 and 1806 , Jefferson also despatched Captain Zebulon Pike of New Jersey on two expeditions . One was to explore the upper Mississippi , the other the springs of the Arkansas and the Rio Grande . Pike found Pike 's Peak and explored the vast vague country southward . His task was to settle the line of the Mexican border . The Lewis and Clark expedition excited the country as Raleigh and I Iakluyt excited the people of England , for it disclosed an unknown world of mystery and marvels and opened it up for enterprise , settlement , and thought . Ascending the Missouri , the party followed the Yellowstone River , then crossed the divide of the Rockies and descended westward till it reached the Columbia River and at last the Pacific ; and its quiet and disciplined progress was a tribute to the leaders , their deep regard for each other , and their fatherly care of the men . Lewis was instinctively a writer and thinker and a well-trained lover of natural history . Now and then , stirred by a noble scene , he expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pencil of Salvator Rosa . Clark , the draftsman of the party , made all the maps and careful drawings of the birds , fishes , and animals they discovered on the way . Both wrote separate journals , encouraging the others to write as well , and four additional journals were kept by the sergeants ; for Jefferson had begged them for accurate scientific data , and all the journals abounded in fresh observations . Many of the birds and animals were altogether unknown to science , and one or another first described the Rocky Mountain rat , the mountain goat , the American antelope , a snail , and two new kinds of grouse . They discovered the Lewis woodpecker and the Clark nutcracker , and they gave the first adequate descriptions of the prairie dog , the coyote , and the Western grizzly bear . They preserved specimens of plants , observed the ways of the wild geese , and found a fish that yielded a quartof oil . From time to time they made up packages to be sent to Jefferson , antelope skins and skeletons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weasel skins and buffalo robes , a foxskin , bows and arrows and painted Indian robes and pottery . Some of these were later shown at Monticello , while others were deposited in Peale 's Museum . They also recorded the vocabularies of some of the Indians , who had never seen guns and were frightened by the burning glass which the expedition used for making fires . In camp they feasted on fine trout and buffaloes ' humps and marrowbones ; and they dressed skins for their clothes and danced and sang . Meanwhile , the young men were sometime fractious and misbehaved with the tawny damsels . Most of the notes on natural history were omitted by the editor who wove the various journals together in a readable paraphrase : indeed , it was not for a hundred years that readers ever saw their elaborate and remarkable descriptions of the creatures of the West .
