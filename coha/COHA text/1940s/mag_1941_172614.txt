A bull cavorting in a china shop was nothing to the stir raised last week when a china merchant lumbered into a bull pen . The china merchant was big , bluff Colonel the Right Honorable Josiah Clement Wedgwood , **26;16862;TOOLONG of the Josiah Wedgwood who founded Britain 's famed pottery works . The bull pen was Congress . <P> Beetle-browed , 69-year-old Colonel Wedgwood is no fancy-pants . He fought for Britain in the Boer War , in World War I was wounded and won his D.S.O. Like the first Josiah , who got himself well hated for championing the cause of the upstart American colonies , Colonel " Josh " is a fighting progressive . For 35 years ( first as Liberal , then as Laborite ) he has been a Member of Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme . <P> One day last month Colonel Josh landed in the U.S. He had every right to be there - for 90% of the business of Josiah Wedgwood &; Sons Ltd. ( whose managing director is the Colonel 's son Josiah ) is done in Canada , the West Indies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel 's spirited but discreet lectures . Then a reporter for Hearst 's International News Service got an interview with Colonel Wedgwood in Boston . According to Hearst 's man , the Colonel spoke out in forthright terms against U.S. inaction . Said he : " The trouble with you Americans is that you 're afraid to assume responsibilities . Your President has assumed a large share of responsibility , it 's true , but why have n't you got a sensible Congress ? . . . After all , this is your war and you are in it up to your necks . " <P> Touchy Congressional isolationists jumped a mile . Snorted Representative Paul Shafer of Michigan , a member of the Military Affairs Committee : " You , Colonel Wedgwood , are one of the principal cogs in Great Britain 's propaganda machine . . . . " Said Montana 's bull-like Senator Burton Wheeler : " I resent a member of the British Parliament coming to the United States to criticize the American Congress . . . . " <P> But worse was to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeler had said . The peppery old Colonel exploded . Said he : " Tell Wheeler to go soak his head . Who is he , anyway ? He 's from Montana , I understand , but what nationality was he originally ? " In calmer tones the Colonel added : " We have had years and years of these wretched appeasers like Wheeler in England , doing nothing and hoping for the best . . . . At the very kindest , I say such people are misled . . . . " <P> A newsman in the Senate gallery sent these words down to Burt Wheeler . Cried Senator Wheeler : " . . . There is not a drop of blood flowing through my veins except English , and my people came here from England something like 300 years ago . . . . Think of the gall . . . the insolence . . . . A man such as Wedgwood should be run out of the United States .                  @ @ @
