txt There is increasing evidence of confusion in Washington in connection with our national defense program . The following sequence is significant : At his press conference on June 4 the President declared that he saw no reason , vital to national defense , for holding Congress in session throughout the emergency except , as he rather unflatteringly added , for file no doubt " laudable " purpose of making speeches . On June 11 he said that , while he did not desire to be in the position of saying that Congress should go- home if it did not want to , he saw no reason why it could not clear up its work in a couple of weeks and adjourn . The pressure of public opinion kept Congress in session except for a recess for a week during the Republican con -- vention . Meanwhile on June 17 identical bills were introduced in the House and Senate calling for the building of eighty-four more fighting ships for the Navy in the next four years at a cost of $1,200,000,000 . The next day Admiral Stark , Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add 200 new ships ; the bills introduced the day before were immediately scrapped , the great " twoocean " Navy Bill has already been approved by the House , and will apparently be approved this week by the Senate . Now it is announced that the President will ask tomorrow for 55,000 , - 000,000 more still , of which $4,000,000 , - 000 would go to the Army and $1,000 , - 000,000 to the Navy . Thus , after seeing nothing ahead a few weeks ago to keep Congress in session , the Administration has already asked it to approve immediately a huge program totaling $9,000,000,000 . Congress has already voted $5,082,000,000 for defense at the present session , which alone is nearly five times as much as was spent for defense in the 1939 fiscal year . Serious questions must be raised about these huge requests . We face today an emergency which grows immediately out of the present war situation . To provide against this emergency Congress must appropriate every dollar needed for the maximum defense and armament production procurable within the next twelve months or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of Congress can make what appropriations seem advisable in the light of the situation then existing . There is no point in beginning now to plan or lay down battleships which can not be completed for four , five or seven years , when our shipbuilding capacity is immediately needed for turning out destroyers and other light craft that can be completed , with standard designs , in a matter of months . Not merely the public , but Congress itself , does not know how the money already appropriated for defense in the last few weeks is to be spent . No one knows how much can profitably be spent in the next twelve months ; how much can actually be turned in that time into planes and ships and tanks and guns , and how much in contracts can profitably be given out . Yet to appropriate more than this is dangerously misleading . A " $10,000,000,000 defense program " makes sensational headlines , but it does not necessarily turn out any more completed munitions and equipment and trained men in given period than a much more modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychc logically like blinding headlights behin which the country fails to notice who is actually being done . Clearly some expert coordinatin body should determine our defens needs and which needs have priorit3 The actual job of procurement shoul then be turned over to an organizatio headed by a single man . Mr. Knudsen ' powers should be increased and hi duties more clearly defined . In the fa ( that when Messrs . Stimson and Kno are confirmed by the S-niate this wee two energetic and able men will start with clean slates as , respectively , Sec retary of War and Secretary of th Navy , there is hope that some essentiE reforms will be undertaken promptly .
