When Charles Dickens published his second novel , Oliver Twist , in 1838 , no loud cries of " anti-Semitism ! " were raised - though one of the principal characters in the book was a " villainous-looking and repulsive " old Jew named Fagin . Last week there was a chorus of loud cries in the U.S.* over the new movie version of Oliver Twist . <P> British Cinemogul J. Arthur Rank was probably wishing that his gifted director , David ( Brief Encounter ) Lean , had not been quite so conscientious in copying Dickens and his illustrator , George Cruikshank . Director Lean 's Great Expectations was hailed wherever it was shown as a superbly Dickensian cinema ( TIME , May 26 , 1947 ) . In Fagin 's case , Lean actually followed Cruikshank more closely than Dickens . The film never calls Fagin a Jew ( Dickens rarely called him anything else ) , but he is faithfully villainous and repulsive-and unmistakably a Jew . <P> One loud howl came from New York Star Columnist Albert Deutsch ; who had seen the picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dickens . . . could not make Fagin half so horrible , " and warned that the film would fan the flames of antiSemitism . In Manhattan , the Board of Rabbis appealed to Eric Johnston to keep the movie off U.S. screens . Other Jewish groups took up the cry . <P> In Toronto , where Oliver Twist had been showing for three weeks , the theater manager noted little comment against Fagin , no unfavorable publicity , no effect on business . The Toronto Jewish Congress called on Rank representatives to complain , but later decided to drop the matter . " We feel , " one was quoted as saying , that an Englishman has just as much right to complain about Bill Sikes . " Could Rank quiet the din by reshooting some scenes in the $1,600,000 picture ? It seemed impractical ; there were too many shots of Fagin , and some members of the cast had scattered . Last week Rank announced that the U.S. release would be " indefinitely postponed .
