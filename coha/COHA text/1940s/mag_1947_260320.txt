Gloated a Sears , Roebuck &; Co. executive : " We 've caught the whole radio-phonograph business with its pants down . " <P> Sears got into gloating position by putting a revolutionary gadget on the market last week : a table-model radio-phonograph containing a wire recorder . The recorder gobbles up radio programs , phonograph records , children 's talk and business conferences on a spool of steel wire , can play them back immediately . The wire can be electrically erased , re-used indefinitely . <P> But the real eye-opener was the price : <P> $169.50 . Sears 's big worry was to keep up with demand . With only 5,000 sets on hand and production at only 150 a day , Sears sold 1,000 in the first three days .
