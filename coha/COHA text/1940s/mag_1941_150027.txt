The U. S. public last week got its answer to the big question : When , and on what scale , was the automobile industry going to turn its mass-production genius into the job of building airplanes for national defense ? Fortnight ago , Ford and Chrysler announced that they would help with the business of building bombers . Last week the rest of the answer came from G. M. 's President Charles Erwin Wilson ( successor to Big Bill Knudsen ) . General Motors was going into the bomber business , too . From the three , the U. S. should get its bombers at the rate of 5,000 a year , by March 1942 . <P> In numbers as well as in product the planned output of the Big Three was a long way from the plan of C. I. O. 's Walter Reuther for putting Detroit to work ( TIME , Dec. 30 ) . Mr. Reuther had made a good but obvious point when he said that the automotive industry could do a big job of airplane building . But his further assertion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could produce 500 pursuit planes a day had long since been dismissed as fantastic . For , even if that rate could be attained , nobody would know what to do with such a glut , 150,000 fighters a year . <P> Last week earnest Mr. Reuther announced that his 500-a-day figure was only his yardstick of Detroit 's potential capacity , that the automotive industry could as well make an imposing ( but lesser ) number of two-and four-motored bombers . <P> This was where the Big Three came in . Their plan will not turn out complete planes in Detroit . General Motors , Chrysler and Ford will build airplane sub-assemblies , ship them to four midwest and southwest assembly plants , there to be put together by aircraft mechanics under the supervision of airplane manufacturers . Detroit has already prepared to build engines to fly bombers . Ford is building Pratt &; Whitney engines , Buick will build a plant ( near Chicago ) to do the same . Studebaker will build Wrights . During the past three weeks , while the Big Three were preparing to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for aircraft accessories , wing panels and other plane parts to automotive suppliers-Murry Corp . of America , Briggs Manufacturing Co. , Hayes Manufacturing Corp . <P> General Motors ' choice of an airplane to build was the Army 's speedy 6-25 , a slim , two-engined bomber made by big North American Aviation ( in which G. M. owns a 29% stock interest ) . G. M. 's bits and pieces will be shipped to a new plant ( owned by the Government , operated by North American ) , there assembled , tested , flown away for service . <P> Ford and Chrysler also have made their choice . In San Diego , Edsel Ford and his crack Production Chief Charles E. Sorensen spent a couple of days looking over a Consolidated ( B24 ) four-motored bomber , then went north to Santa Monica to talk to Planemaker Donald Wills Douglas . Result of many conferences was Ford 's announcement that it would build 6-245 for assembly in two plants . Consolidated will operate a plant at Fort Worth , and Don Douglas will see that his competitors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plant at Tulsa . Chrysler 's pick was Glenn Martin 's new 6-26 , a two-engined medium bomber ( TIME , Jan. 6 ) to be assembled by Martin men in a new plant at Omaha .
