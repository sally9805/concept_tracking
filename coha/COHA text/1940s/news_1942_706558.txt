txt Women Doctors in Service There Seems to Be Some Difference of Opinion Concerning Availability To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Army patronizingly allows women physicians to serve but gives them no military rating . The Navy just does not permit them at all . Our allies in England , Russia and China are far in advance of us in this respect . I should think that the United States would be eager to rectify an antiquated attitude . How can they on one hand accept nurses in both services , giving them military rating , and on the other decline to admit women doctors , among which group are found the highest type of learned , educated and useful members of the human race ? It simply does not make sense . MARGARET THAYER TALBOTT , Vice President , New York Infirmary for Women and Children . New York , July 6 , 1942.
