Perched in his San Simeon splendor , Mr. Hearst was supposed to be hopping mad . This young Orson Welles had made for RKO an insulting movie about his life called Citizen Kane . Led by his official ministress to the movie capital , Columnist Lolly Parsons , many a Hearst favor-seeker sent word to The Chief that they could fix everything . Soon the machinery of Hollywood pressure began to throttle Citizen Kane . <P> First approach was to M. G. M. Headman Louis B. Mayer , an old Hearst friend and spiritual shepherd of Hollywood 's producers . Mr. Mayer was warned that the release of Kane would mean a good , old-fashioned Hearstian attack on Hollywood-lots of stories on the intimate facts of the intimate lives of the movie colony . Hearst 's gossip-dishing Adela Rogers St. Johns was placed on the firing line . <P> Louis Mayer gathered his forces and worked fast . RKO has few theatres in which to show its films , was reminded of its reliance on the theatres of the other major companies . There were warnings that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even guarded talk that other studios would chip in to defray the $800,000 RKO had spent on Citizen Kane . <P> The muscles of the Hollywood hierarchy were sufficiently frightening . At an RKO sales meeting in Chicago last week , exhibitors were told that no decision had been reached on Kane . Then , at week 's end , word leaked out of Hollywood that Mr. Hearst , who still had n't seen the film , had been approached by an unhappy RKO stockholder . Mr. Hearst admitted he really did n't care whether the film was released or not . Chances looked good that after an RKO directors ' meeting in Manhattan this week , a decision would at long last be made to release the picture . In Hollywood it meant the first challenge to the long , long reign of Louis B. Mayer and his court .
