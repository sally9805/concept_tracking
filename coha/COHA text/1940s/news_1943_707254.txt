txt Taxation Basis Suggested Though more taxes , savings , or both , are realistic media for combating inflation and paying gigantic war costs , future modifications in the income tax structure should respect not only ability to pay and other orthodox principles of taxation , but comparative individual incomes should be evaluated .
