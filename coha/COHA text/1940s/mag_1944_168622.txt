This week Allied air command had sober reason to think they could force the Luftwaffe into a decisive battle with only one result : elimination of Germany 's air defenses . They had some reason to think that at least part of that task was already accomplished . Germany 's airmen could still fight well-but not every day . <P> In the overall sense the great air attacks now being launched from England are only the prelude to the unopposed destruction of German war potential and the land invasion that will finally destroy Nazi power . But in the immediate sense , the air campaign is itself a sizeable war , which has inflicted critical damage on the enemy 's cities and armed forces . <P> Double Blade . The Allied air weapon was cutting as a two-edged sword . Air officers welcomed the chance either to dismantle Germany 's war industry at trifling cost , or , better still , to whittle down the tiring Luftwaffe squadrons in the process . <P> Last summer , after frantic efforts , the Nazis had lifted their fighter-plane production to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened their methodical campaign against aircraft factories , assembly plants , repair depots . Last week Allied authorities reckoned that the Germans were getting only 25% of the new fighters expected by March . <P> But it was no guess that the Luftwaffe had lost 301 fighters in two daylight air battles over Berlin last week , and it was no guess that when the U.S. bombers came back in force for a third attack within four days , the Luftwaffe planes did not come up to oppose them . <P> For a precedent , military historians looked back to the classic battles of landbound days , and wondered if this might be the stage when the weaker side had committed its reserves and was failing . Then the stronger would strike the knockout blow . He would send in his cavalry , ripping through the flagging line , then pour infantry through the breach while his horsemen drove on , carving a decision in the enemy 's disorganized rear areas . <P> The days to come would tell whether the parallel would hold good for the U.S. Eighth Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful air offensive in history rolled through its third week , the Luftwaffe was behaving exactly like a fighter who finds the going too rugged , knows instinctively that he must break off or risk exhaustion and knockout . <P> Air Attrition . Early in the week 800 U.S. bombers and nearly 1,000 fighters had fought a terrific battle to , from and over Berlin ; 176 enemy fighters were downed , but the German was still impressive , capable . The U.S. losses were the biggest yet : 68 heavy bombers and eleven fighters . <P> Two days later a slightly smaller attacking force slugged its way in through a thinning overcast and plastered the key Erkner ball-bearing works at Berlin . The air combat was still large scale : 38 bombers and 15 fighters were lost , 125 Nazi planes shot down . <P> Peace &; Quiet . But again next day a similar bombing force went out , and this time the Eighth cashed in on its recuperative powers . Flying above a heavy overcast the U.S. ships sorted out their Berlin targets with secret instruments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
