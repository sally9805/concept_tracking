 | A World Series ticket stub does n't seem like the most useful thing to carry into battle , or a still unused bus transfer , or even the Red Ribbon someone once won for a favorite hog at the County Fair . But these are the things tucked in the corners of the wallets our soldiers carry . These wallets bulge with snapshots , scraps of paper , all sorts of mementos . Girls ' telephone numbers on corners torn from envelopes , good-luck charms , innumerable addresses , a cocktail recipe on the reverse of a bridge score , club membership cards ? and just the odds and ends that no one has the courage to throw away . For instance , a line sergeant , why has more than five years of service to his credit and has been stationed in Hawaii and other distant bases , still carries the specifications for a piece of curtain goods his mother asked him to buy downtown ? two years ago , when he was on his last furlough . And the company truck driver keeps his AAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , and tires are supplied by the government , and special Army facilities look after overhauling , repairs , and all conceivable emergencies . But his faith in the AAA is unshaken . Everyone carries his Social Security card and , of all things , his Selective Service registration card . Despite the free-mail privileges of soldiers , almost everyone carries postage stamps . " This is what is known as a press card , " says the stout boy in Tent 7 . " And this is a special press pass issued by the New York World 's Fair . I must have used it a thousand times . It used to be lovely going into the Italian building and making remarks about Mussolini to the guards . " On some dull evening , when the boys are @#  | chewing the fat in Tent 11 , one of them will say , " I left a **25;203;TOOLONG job to come here . " He is interrupted immediately by a loud and sustained chorus of Bronx cheers . Thereupon the wallet is brought forth and state and federal income-tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sale for a . motorcycle . And another will carry a formula for dog food . There are times when , for no traceable reason , a wave of nostalgia will sweep the company , and it is then that the fathers bring forth from their wallets the ' snapshots of their young . The spell will last two or three days , and the tension becomes such that the married men and the single men separate into two groups . " We took the car through the Green Mountains that summer . " " That 's him in front of our City Hall . " Some inverted form of self-defense impels the single men to exhibit their pictures : the niece-and-nephew crowd , displaying shots of toothy children ; but most of them pass around pictures of best girls . " I stole that picture from her cousin . " " She 's an expert tennis player . " " This is not a very good likeness . " THE lad who has neither children nor steady girl can have the company of the cynic who carries in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the installment plan . After he had made two payments , he went into the Army and decided that he could not afford to keep up either the ring or the girl , so he let them both lapse . " That 's me on my motorcycle . " " That 's me with my dog . " And all sorts of mementos . " Delegate 's button from the district 4-H convention , " says Red from Upstate . " A penny my girl sent me , " says the little squad leader with the square face . " Why a penny ? Good-luck charm ? " " No , she owed me a penny . " Addresses of people one must write to ? and never does . " A fellow I met on the train . We got to camp , and that was the last I saw of him . I was supposed to write , but you know how it is . Nice guy , too . " Union cards ; insurance receipts ; newspaper clippings .

" He was a Russian , and he used to make that camera do impossible things . But whenever he made a mistake , he 'd shout at himself : You are not photographer . You are just a dirty little man . ' " A pair of theatre-ticket stubs that suggest a face and an evening and a memory . The Army of the United States is made up of civilians . The men are in it to do a job , not because they like to strut in uniform . It is pleasant and necessary for them to think of the life from which they came and to which they hope to return . They hold in their wallets every little object that ties them to that life . No matter under how many layers of khaki you swathe a man , his left hip-pocket remains civilian .
