Tito relaxed his talons , and the three American G.I.s and their mongrel mascot , which had shared their Yugoslav captivity with them , marched back to freedom . The Yugoslavs made the snatch last week while feeling out how far they could bluff the thin line of U.S. troops into bending back the new Yugoslav-Trieste frontier which they were guarding . <P> In Trieste , once more in the world of free men , the three released Americans , Lieut . William Van Atten , Pfc . Glen A. Meyer and Pfc . Earl G. Hendrick Jr. , told their story of five days in the Yugoslav shadows . <P> The Yugos had quizzed them for hours , harangued them on Russia 's power , vainly tried to make them talk about U.S. military strength and U.S. political intentions in Trieste . To such questions , the Americans gave a routine , unenlightening reply : their name , rank and serial numbers . <P> At one point , the Yugoslavs whipped out pictures of Lenin , Stalin and Tito and asked the Americans to identify them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chess game . <P> Said Lieut . Van Atten : " The most surprising thing about the whole incident was the extreme belligerency of the Yugoslavs in seizing us and then the contrasting careful way they treated us before our release .
