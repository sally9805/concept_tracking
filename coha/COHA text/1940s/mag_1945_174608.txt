Though it had a gold rush , a shattering earthquake , Jack London and two world 's fairs in its past , San Francisco looked forward with interest to the World Security conference . Last week , as the vanguard of a small army of delegates and correspondents began arriving , the city was ready to do its part to set the stage of history . <P> There would be good weather-in April San Francisco 's summer fogs are only beginning to roll in from the Pacific , and there are days in which the bay is blue , and the city 's fabled hills stand in sun-filled haze . There would be plenty of liquor , and San Francisco , a city with Irish street names , expected the great men to have a drink when they felt like it . There would be good food from the city 's famed restaurants , and every comfort that hotels , clubs and citizens ' committees could provide . <P> The Palace Hotel would have fresh California fruit in its rooms each day ; the Mark Hopkins sternly warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also cautioned them that some guests might not even tip them . <P> Gift of Tongues . Everywhere waiters , clerks and plain citizens who could speak foreign languages were suddenly popular . The Yellow Cab company announced that it had 70 drivers capable of conversing in alien tongues , including Assyrian . Correspondents would be offered every help in the way of workrooms , telegraph service , reference material-even a volunteer corps of ex-newspapermen ready and anxious to substitute as rewrite men for correspondents bowled over by the bottle . The city was prepared to offer them plenty of entertainment-cocktail parties , ferry and airplane rides , press cards good for squaring minor infractions of the law . <P> A civic committee , picked by San Francisco 's businessman mayor-golfing , gregarious Roger Lapham-would introduce delegates to the city 's social life at a reception , take them to museums , find them seats for symphony concerts and baseball games . <P> No delegate would feel that San Francisco was lacking in the manifestations of hospitality and good will . <P> The World , The West . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stampede which followed the discovery of a gold nugget at Sutter 's Mill . The town had grown richer in the raw , exciting days of the Comstock and Mother Lodes . Proud of the independence its riches brought , it had still reached for contact with the eastern U.S. , first by stagecoach , then by the pony express , then by the transcontinental railroad . <P> It had sent ships to the ports of the world . The Chinese , the Irish , the Italians , Russians and men of other tongues had made it cosmopolitan . But San Francisco remained a western American city . There , where enthusiastic miners once tossed gold nuggets at Actress Lotta Crabtree-who presented the town with a memorial fountain ( " Lotta 's Fountain " ) - the old atmosphere of violence , love of opulence , independence and friendliness has thinned . But it has never been dissipated .
