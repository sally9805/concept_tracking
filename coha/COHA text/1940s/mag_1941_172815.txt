If a nation values anything more than freedom it will lose its freedom . <P> - Somerset Maugham . <P> Traditional among democratic freedoms is habeas corpus , established in England by the Magna Charta , in the U.S. by the Constitution . It gives imprisoned men the right to demand that either they be set free or the charges against them be examined . Without it , civil liberty ceases . <P> In London last week the right to habeas corpus was stoutly defended , war or no war , by bald , handsome James Richard Baron Atkin , 74 , in a dissenting opinion likely to rank with some of those of the late great Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes . <P> Pithy and popular is Australian-born Lord Atkin , ardent Welshman by adoption , one of Parliament 's five " law lords " ( who act as a sort of supreme court , reviewing cases on points of national importance carried from the Court of Appeal ) . Lord Atkin is noted for his liberalism regarding divorce legislation . He once attacked a proposed bill to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of a soldier whose wife had deceived him . Said Lord Atkin : " It seems to me a monstrous thing that that man should not have been entitled to be freed from that woman and to marry again for five years . ... I suppose he should have adjusted his personality . What he did was . . . shoot her . " <P> In a test case last week , Lord Atkin dissented from his colleagues ' opinion that , under the Emergency Powers ( Defense ) legislation , Home Secretary Herbert Morrison had the right to detain persons at his own discretion , not subject to court interference . <P> " In this country , even amid the clash of arms , laws are not silent .. It has always been . . . one of the principles of liberty for which , on recent authority , this country is now fighting , that judges . . . stand between the subject and any attempted encroachment of liberty by the executive , alert to see that any coercive action is justified by law . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been addressed acceptably to a court of the king 's Bench in the time of Charles I. ... But in English law every imprisonment is prima facie unlawful and puts a burden on the person directing the imprisonment of justifying his act . " <P> Lord Atkin 's dissent spoke for itself so loudly that Parliament planned to reconsider the Home Secretary 's wartime powers .
