Information Director Elmer Davis , who has a purist 's regard for history and one of the driest humors in Washington , last week handed his assistants a sly rebuke . Said a Davis memo : <P> In material issued by OWI , the phrase World War I is not to be used unless referring to the War of the Grand Alliance , nor the phrase World War II unless referring to the War of the Spanish Succession . <P> <P> Only danger was that some literal-minded OWI newcomer might some day refer to the defeat of the French armies at Blenheim by Austria 's Prince Eugene , might label it a World War II* development , might thus thoroughly mystify the U.S. public . <P> <P> <P> *The locutions World War I and World War II originated in the pages of TIME .
