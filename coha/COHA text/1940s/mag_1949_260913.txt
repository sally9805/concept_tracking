Man 's troubles really started when he got on his hind legs . So says Russian Biologist S. D. Antipin , until last week head of the department of general biology at the Kishinev Medical Institute . <P> " As the descendant of a four-legged animal , man is constructed on the horizontal principle , " Antipin had told a group of workers . " By becoming vertical , he is like a steam engine rolling along on its back wheels ... By using artificial meat grinders instead of his own teeth , he has weakened his chewing equipment and acquired the toothache . . . Man 's internal organs pile up one on top of the other like the floors of a building . This causes heart ailments . . . <P> " Monkeys have thin , pressed-in lips , while people have fleshy lips turned outward . It is not by chance that many ladies paint their lips : they are trying to say , ' Look , I 'm a human , not a monkey . ' " <P> Soviet officialdom decided to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavorting about on all fours . In Izvestia , Party Polemicist Boris Lavrenev reported that a look at Antipin 's family tree revealed a wretched bourgeois background . The professor had fought the Red army as a member of Admiral Kolchak 's White Guard in 1919 . Obviously , Lavrenev concluded , Antipin was nothing but " a common adventurer , slavishly addicted to idiotic . . . ravings ; " <P> This week the Soviet Ministry of Health announced that Adventurer Antipin had been fired .
