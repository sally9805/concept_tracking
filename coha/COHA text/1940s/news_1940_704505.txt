txt Postmaster General James A. Farley today authorized the announcement of his candidacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination . His name will be entered in the Massachusetts State primary to be held April 30 . Mr. Farley gave William H. Burke Jr. , chairman of the Democratic State Committee , power of attorney to file a full slate of delegates in the April 30 Presidential preferential primary pledged to vote for the nomination of Mr. Farley for President at the national convention . Expressing the belief that Mr. Farley would be both nominated . and elected to the Presidency , Mr. Burke accepted the commission and promised to produce a slate of delegates at large and one in each of the Commonwealth 's fifteen Congressional districts . Chairman Burke said he believed Mr. Farley 's action in becoming an active candidate for the Presidency had the approval of President Roosevelt , although he denied any direct White House information . Although it was generally known that Mr. Burke had asked Mr , Farley for the power of attorney several days ago , the information that it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Senator Walsh and Attorney General Dever , who have been insisting that the Massachusetts delegates go to the national convention without any commitments . Power of Attorney Shown Two interpretations are placed on Mr. Farley 's announcement : That he was a genuine candidate for the Presidency and that he was seeking to tie up the Massachusetts delegates for President Roosevelt as a candidate for a third term without forcing the President on to become a formal and active candidate . The Massachusetts election laws require a candidate for President seeking pledged delegates to file a written assent with the office of the Secretary of State . Mr. Burke produced a copy of Mr. Farley 's power of attorney and said that he would file it with the Secretary of State at the proper time . In giving Mr. Burke the power of attorney Mr. Farley said " the Democrats of Massachusetts who speak through you as State chairman do me a great honor and I would not be human if I did not say to you that I appreciate the compliment . " Mr. Burke 's statement follows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to select a slate of candidates for places on the Massachusetts delegation to the Democratic National Convention pledged to vote for him as the party 's nominee for President . At my suggestion he has given me a power of attorney to act in his behalf . " This power of attorney I have in my possession and at the proper time I shall file it with the office // FARLEY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENCY // of the Secretary of State in accordance with the statute which requires that it be so filed as a condition to providing for the election of a slate of pledged delegates . Roosevelt Sentiment Cited " I personally have no direct knowledge of the intentions of President Roosevelt , but I believe that Mr. Farley 's procedure in agreeing to engage in a contest for the Massachusetts delegates has the approval of the President , for whom I have an abiding affection . " My observation of the current views of the Democrats of Massachusetts has convinced me that they are overwhelmingly in favor of a third term for Mr. Roosevelt , but that lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are willing to be committed to the support of Mr. Farley . Recognizing such sentiment I have no alternative other than to exert all the influence at my command to assure unanimous party support for Mr. Farley at the convention . " As State committee chairman I am not establishing a precedent in undertaking this task . Eight years ago our State committee chairman selected a slate of delegates to run as pledged candidates in behalf of Alfred E. Smith in the primary . I cite this precedent merely to justify what otherwise might appear to be an intrusion by the State committee into a prirr lry contest . " If there are objections to my procedure I predict that it will be completely justified by the enormous vote that will be cast in the April 30 election for delegates who seek support pledged to vote for Mr. Farley to be their nominee for President . " I am giving herewith a copy of Mr. Farley 's power of attorney : " ' Dear Bill : " ' Your letter of Feb. 7 has been received and its contents noted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as State chairman do me a great honor , and I would not be human if I did not say to you that I appreciate the compliment. % " ' Consider this letter your authority . or power of attorney , to file delegates pledged to my candidacy . " ' Sincerely yours , " ' JAMES A. FARLEY . "
