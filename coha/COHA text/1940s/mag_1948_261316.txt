Delegates to the Western Union conference of Foreign Ministers at The Hague last week got a small practical demonstration of the need for Western Union . On the toile du Nord , the international luxury express which makes a daily Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam run , they had to show their passports , railroad tickets or cash 16 times to 16 different officials in the three countries . At a Dutch border town the train was held up for an hour while inspectors made sure , the passengers had not bought too many U.S. cigarettes during the 20-minute stop at Brussels . <P> In France , the delegates could lunch on the train and pay in French francs . In Belgium a little later they could eat the same lunch , but the Belgian rate of exchange made the meal cost three times as much . If a delegate had a cup of coffee while the train was in France , he got one lump of sugar . In Belgium , he could have two lumps . In The Netherlands , he got as much sugar as he liked-not because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different tourist policy . <P> The conferees had weightier matters than lumps of sugar to discuss , but the sugar symbolized how little progress toward real unity their five nations had made since signing the Brussels pact last March . In four months Western Union had gone a little way toward military integration , but hardly a step toward economic or political unity . <P> Measuring with the Feet . Grim was the only word for the two-day meeting round the green-clothed , rectangular table in Room No. 49 of the Dutch Foreign Office . Britain 's Ernest Bevin was unsmiling and the nervous twitch at the right corner of his mouth was more pronounced than ever . France 's Georges Bidault ( about to lose his job , partly because he had lost popularity by going along with the U.S. on a program of German recovery ) made his points tensely , striking the table with the edge of his hand . The Dutch host-chairman , Baron van Boetzelaer van Oosterhout , fiddled nervously with his papers . Luxemburg 's <P> Pierre Dupong was fidgety .

The Berlin crisis had reminded everyone that it was later than they had thought . <P> An almost wartime secrecy encased the meeting . Black-jacketed , blue-breeched Dutch state police in peaked caps reached for delegates ' passes with their left hands , kept their right hands close to their revolver holsters . In hotel lobbies plainclothesmen sipped Bols gin , eyed everyone coming through the revolving doors . Remarked one stolid Dutch cop at the Hotel des Indes : " I do n't know what we 're watching for , but whatever it is , he wo n't get away with it . " <P> The conference even had a code name - " Metric . " Said a disappointed French delegate after the conference : " We regarded it as a hopeful sign that the British , who usually insist on measuring things with their feet , invented this code name ' Metric ' ; we thought they were coming over to continental ideas . We came here with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you ca n't light fires under the British . "
