txt Governor Dewey disclosed definitely tonight that he does not intend to " bail out " municipalities confronted with financial difficulties by granting to them a greater share of State revenue , nor does he intend to allow them broader taxing powers on a long-term basis . However , he is willing to afford what may amount to substantial temporary relief for the current year . The Governor , speaking tonight at a dinner of the New York State Publishers Association , only hinted at the temporary aid , but in other quarters it is believed that this may be substantial enough , in the case of New York City , to affect the city 's tax rate for the coming year . Mayor La Guardia asked for increased taxing power to raise an additional $30,000,000 for the city during the coming fiscal year , presumably by doubling the rate of the city sales tax , and the answer to this is " No .

Mr. Dewey declared that local communities " in the overwhelming majority of cases " are in sound financial condition .
