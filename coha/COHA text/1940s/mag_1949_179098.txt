The U.S. Government , which had failed twice to kick Australian-born Harry Bridges out of the country as a Communist , was at it again . Last week in San Francisco , a federal grand jury indicted the Longshoremen 's Boss Bridges for perjury . Said Bridges , with the air of a man who was weary of it all : " It 's no surprise . " But the Government thought this time it might prove to be . <P> The indictment charged that when Bridges became a U.S. citizen in 1945 , he lied by swearing that he was not a Communist and never had been . The grand jury , after listening to a few of Bridges ' old labor pals and several ex-Commies , charged that Harry Bridges had been a Communist for twelve years , and that he is still a Communist . <P> Indicted with Bridges were two of his . International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's lieutenants . They are Texas-born Vice President J. R. ( " Bob " ) Robertson and German-born Henry ( " The Dutchman " ) Schmidt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaiian shipping . <P> If the Government 's case sticks , hawk-nosed Harry Bridges faces the possibility of a maximum of seven years ' imprisonment , then deportation , In its previous attempts to deport Bridges , in 1939 and 1941 , the Government cited Bridges ' ties with Communist-front organizations , and produced witnesses who said they had heard him admit to being a Communist . The U.S. Supreme Court in 1945 ruled the evidence insufficient . <P> Last week , John P. Boyd , special assistant to Attorney General Tom Clark , said : " We have evidence that has never been shown up to now . We 're sure we 'll win-otherwise we would n't have brought all this before the grand jury . This is the first criminal indictment ever returned against Bridges . " Harry Bridges , a noisy foe of the Truman Administration , had his own theory about the charges : " A smokescreen to get people 's attention away from what 's happening in Washington .
