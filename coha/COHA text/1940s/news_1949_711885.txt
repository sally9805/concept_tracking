txt Senator Morse of Oregon , one of the few Republicans who opposed the TaftHartley bill in the Eightieth Congress , believes , he says , that the attitude of some business men toward modification of the law is motivated by " unchristian selfishness . " On the other hand , he is warm in his praise of Senator Taft , a fellow-member of the Labor Committee and co-author of the 1917 law . " One of the finest things to come out of our Senate hearings , " he declares , " has been the fair-minded objectivity with which Bob Taft has considered testimony and evidence on the shortcomings of the Taft-Hartley Act . * * * " One may agree or disagree with Senator Morse 's views on specific issues , and one may sometimes wish he were a little less unpredictable . Yet this very unpredictability is the product of a combination of highly desirable qualities . For the Oregon Senator is a conspicuous example of an electoral representative who approaches a problem with an open mind , makes his own decisions , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . None of this , of course , is new to anyone who is familiar with the career of Senator Morse . Standing alone , therefore , the fact that he has gone out of his way to pay tribute to Senator Taft , with whose views on labor matters he has differed more often than he has agreed , would not call for comment . What points up this particular gesture is not the fact that it is unusual or unexpected , but the contrast which it presents to some observations on Mr. Taft made a day earlier by Philip Murray , president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations . To Senator Morse , the fact that Mr. Taft had shown a readiness to consider changes in the 1947 law where it has revealed , shortcomings was something to be applauded . " I am satisfied , " said he , " that while he and I may not agree on all the details , we are much nearer together * * * than when the TaftHartley Law was passed . " Not so Mr. Murray . After reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is clearly an air of triumph that Senator Taft has made " retreats and concessions " on eighteen specific sections of the law of which he was cosponsor . Mr. Murray , who , unlike Senator Morse , had nothing constructive whatsoever to suggest when the 1947 legislation was being considered , hails Mr. Taft 's attitude of conciliation gleefully as " a reluctant confession " that the statute was unworkable and " foreign to sound relations . " Those who followed the progress of the Taft-Hartley bill in 1947 do not have to be told that that legislation was itself produced in an atmosphere of open-mindedness and painstaking care . Hearings before the House committee , covered a period of thirty-eight days and after that the committee deliberated another twenty-eight days before reporting out its bill . Senate committee hearings occupied twenty-seven days , and here Senator Taft made numerous concessions to the Democrats and his three liberal colleagues , Senators Morse , Aiken and Ives . The House bill went a good deal further than its Senate counterpart . And the House itself , in turn , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee 's . When the conference measure came to a vote , 80 per cent of the House a id 76 per cent of the Senate voted in favor of it . Despite the time and care consumed in formulating this measure , and despite the overwhelming vote by which it was passed , . the sponsors of the TaftHartley Law never considered that the last word had been said on the subject of labor legislation . As earnest of this , they created , under Section 401 of that law , a Joint Coinmitte ? on LaborManagement Relations ( the so-called " watchdog committee " ) , to give additional consideration to certain aspects of labor-management relations in particular , and to the operation of the law in general , for a period of nearly two years , or until March 1 , 1949 . As the Senate hearings come to an end today , Senator Morse has charged that such organizations as the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States have failed to approach the question of new labor legislation with an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reminder that , with few exceptions , labor 's leaders have had nothing of a constructive nature . to offer . Finally , the Administration itself has provided no leadership worthy of the name . This means that if a workable and effective labor-management policy is to be achieved , responsibility for that accomplishment will have to be shouldered almost entirely by the people 's representatives in Congress .
