Mindful of the servants , Enid , Junior and Aunt Julie come into the room with outward calm . &nbsp; AUNT JULIEIs n't it time for you two lovebirds to start flying ? &nbsp; LESLIE ( pleasantly ) We 're all ready . Frederic had a few last minute things to attend to . &nbsp; FREDERIC OSBORNE , JR . ( with concern ) For goodness sake , you 're not going to make it . Aunt Julie goes to the bed to get Leslie 's fur coat . Senior crosses to the far corner of the room , and , reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie 's bridal corsage .

As we DISSOLVE IN , we find Senior in white ducks and a turtle neck sweater working his middle-aged spread off on the rowing machine . Leslie , in slacks , spurns the superior equipment of the gymnasium , and prefers the good old-fashioned " getting down on the floor and rolling it off " method . She is rolling four to the bar right and four to the bar left .

Nobody can sing on an empty stomach . &nbsp; FREDERIC OSBORNE , SR.We have to do better than that . ( very wistfully ) Nobody can sing with an empty heart either . At this unexpected romanticism , Leslie stops rolling , and looks at him incredulously . &nbsp; LESLIEThat 's enough now . Drop your anchor before you drown in your own sentimentality . Senior stops rowing . He takes a cigarette and lights it . He throws a Turkish towel around his shoulders . She continues her rolling . &nbsp; FREDERIC OSBORNE , SR.You have to do a little more for people these days . You have to give that one extra inch . &nbsp; LESLIEI 'll give him that extra inch . . .
