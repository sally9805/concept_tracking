In World War II the long-term measure of military striking power is the power to produce , and production is on the side of the nations with the heaviest industries . On the following two pages TIME presents a map of Europe showing the distribution of Europe 's productive capacity among the combatants . It shows above all the striking effects which Germany 's conquests have had on her capacity to wage modern war . <P> The Industrial Revolution determined the location of Europe 's heavy industries-close to the sources of coal and iron . Europe 's major coal field lies roughly in a great arc . Using Oslo as a centre it is possible to describe that arc with a compass . It begins in the Scottish Lowland and ends in Upper Silesia . On it or close to it are strewn the maroon areas of mining districts and the red areas of manufacturing-the English Midlands , South Wales , northern France , Belgium 's Sambre-Meuse Valley , Holland 's Limburg , the Saar , the Ruhr , middle Germany . Lesser mining and manufacturing areas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor in productive capacity are they of comparable significance . <P> Through this vast productive crescent , sprinkled with iron ore , the pattern of industry runs with scarcely an interruption-dingy houses , sooty factories , chimneys , smoke , grime . Here are the blast furnaces , iron foundries , rolling mills which turn out the indispensable metal of warfare-steel . Here is the crucible which forges the weapons of World War II . <P> Less than half of this crescent ( and not the richest half ) was in prewar Germany . Nonetheless with her great industrial talents Germany managed to produce about 20% of Europe 's manufactures . On the Lower Rhine near the coal of the Ruhr was four-fifths of her industry . In that neighborhood are 16 cities with populations of better than 100,000 apiece-among them Cologne , Essen , Dsseldorf , Duisborg-Ruhrort , world 's largest inland port . But the mills of industry do not grind without metal-bearing ores , and Germany was weak in them . <P> She had enough lead , zinc , and magnesium . That was all . Two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imported . To feed her highly-developed smelters at Leipzig , Breslau , etc. , she had little or no bauxite ( aluminum ore ) , antimony , tin or the critical ferro-alloy metals : molybdenum , tungsten , chrome , nickel . The map shows how conquest enlarged her resources . Fine lines show her post-Versailles boundaries , the heavy line her holdings at the end of year I of World War II . <P> Austria was the first victim . But Austria , which had not recovered from World War I , did not bring Germany much because her own industries were fed by imports . So were Czecho-Slovakia 's . From both of them Germany got an annual supply of nearly 4,000,000 tons of iron ore ( a third of her own production ) . In the event that Germany should be bombed out of the Ruhr , Austria 's iron and steel industry at Graz , CzechoSlovakia 's well-developed heavy industry near Prague ( including the mighty Skoda munitions works at Pilsen ) will be important .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
