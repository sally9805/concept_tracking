Smith presented new ones : in the fiscal year ending in June , $28 billion instead of $26 billion ; in the new fiscal year , $70 billion instead of $56 billion . <P> In 1940 the U.S. averaged $230,000,000 a month on preparation for war . Last year the spending doubled , tripled and quadrupled , to $1.5 billion a month . But Pearl Harbor really tore off the brakes . Within two months spending leaped to $2.3 billion , to $3 billion by April . By June it will be $3.5 billion ; by September , $5 billion .
