ANDY AND THE VILLAGE VIRUS A STORY BY PHILIP CURT/SS T tinczEttem.rx Andy Payson was one of those men at whom civilization should frown . Except for an almost forgotten year or so in the family steel-tube business and except for one Herculean walking trip through the Bavarian Alps , his entire life had apparently been devoted to the single aim of avoiding every possible form of physical effort . Even when he settled permanently in West Gosset he took up none of those hardy pursuits by which men of his sort , living in the country , are supposed to add color and purpose to their existences . He did not shoot , he did not fish , and when some doctor scared him about his liver he merely trudged one mile straight up the road , turned and trudged back again , as if to get the nasty business over as soon as possible . If left to himself he would have gone every day from breakfast to his favorite armchair and stayed there , with brief intermissions , until one or two o'clock the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oddly , everybody liked Andy , even the roaring , back-slapping sportsmen and the restless , unsmiling business men who during the house-party seasons flowed in and out of West Cosset . Possibly they secretly envied him his talents . More likely , they were never really conscious of any great lack of motion in the Payson household , for Molly Payson had enough energy for five or six people . After one of Molly 's cocktail parties , with forty or fifty young-marriedsall Clattering at once , it offered a charming contrast to come down the next morning and find Andy sitting in peace and silence alone in his armchair . Yes , so far as men were concerned , Andy got along very well , but with the women of his acquaintance he was constantly having trouble . Women as a race hate to see anything unused or idle , especially masculine energy , and most of Molly 's friends , like Molly herself , were incessantly prodding Andy to get out and do something . That by itself never bothered Andy , but they were also constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnics , and bustling , highminded affairs of community interest in which it would usually develop somehow or other that Andy was expected to do most of the work . The result was that Andy had developed a tortuous technic to ward off these assaults on his rest periods . He never , for one thing , refused point-blank . He had learned long ago that that would only mean a two-day , tight-lipped silence from Molly . Nor could he , any more , depend on the crass and obvious device of buying exemption by offering to subscribe fifty dollars or to furnish all the ice cream . His favorite method was to agree loudly and enthusiastically at first but then to slip a gradual and subtle little series of monkey wrenches into the machinery of the proposition until even its original progenitors got tired and abandoned it . He would discover just in time , for example , that the day scheduled for the Mountain Top Players was also the day of the Hambletonian race , and so of course everybody would be too tired to come . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most intolerable aunt would decide to run up for a visit during the very week in which Molly had planned to open her house to the garden clubs of western Massachusetts . The fact that Molly was superb as a wide-sweep organizer but rather weak with a memorandum pad and a calendar made such devices almost childishly easy . From years of this kind of border warfare Andy , likc Wellington , had learned that no one device would fit every emergency , but , also like the Great Duke , he had learned not to wear himself out between alarms . For days and even weeks he could sink back into his beloved philosophic meditation , but his trained intuitions were always on guard , ready to signal to him the first signs of anything that sounded like public welfare . In such a frame of mind Andy was sitting in his library one morning early in March , but possibly he had allowed his vigilance somewhat to relax , because it was from his point of view an absolutely ideal day . Outside it was raining sheets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piazzas and blanked out the half-frozen lake at the foot of the lawn . It was , moreover , one of those unimportant seasons of the year that Andy particularly loved . The snow was gone and so were the house parties . Not even the pussy willows had dared show their heads , while all the roads except the main highways could be depended upon to be hub-deep in mud . It was , in short , exactly the sort of day when other people might be expected  --  if ever  --  to stay at home and mind their own business . Lulled by the happy little crackle of the steam radiators and the periodic MAGAZINE rumble of the oil furnace in the cellar below him , Andy had begun to feel once more that the world was good and great , when suddenly the trained sentinels of his instincts set off their alarm and at once he was tense and waiting . A car had been heard coming up the driveway and , judging by the sound , the operator was someone unfamiliar with its bumps and gullies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an inch or two open , Andy listened and , scene by scene , began to construct the panorama of what was happening . The doorbell rang  --  yes , it must be a stranger . The reluctant Monday-morning feet of Edwin , the colored butler , padded out from the dining room , but when a woman 's voice spoke Edwin answered in his best stage-butler manner . Andy swallowed cautiously , for this always meant danger . Edwin 's feet went up the stairs . Molly 's feet came down . There was a moment of puzzled silence , then a chorus of squeals and embraces . This might mean much or it might mean little . There was still a chance that the caller was only one of Molly 's old friends who had stopped in to lunch on her way back from Placid . On the other hand , Molly was free with her squeals and embraces . You could never tell to whom she might award them . The voices passed on into the living room , where Molly 's voice , which told nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , is n't that wonderful ! " ? " I have n't seen her for ages ! " ? while the voice of the visitor , which might have told all , remained only a vague , although well-sustained , murmur . Outside , a fresh swirl of rain made the windows look like an aquarium . Reassured , Andy was about to settle back when abruptly all the bugles sounded . The visitor 's voice had come to a stop ? and , clear as a bell , came Molly 's favorite words , " We 'll go and ask Andy . " Andy moistened his lips , pulled down his waistcoat , and took his feet off the little box ottoman . He was just warning ANDY AND THE his cheek muscles to get ready for a smile when the door swung inward and Molly pushed into the room ahead of her  --  well , what Andy had to admit was the most unexpected vision that had ever been blown in by a March rainstorm . The visitor , in brief , was one of those slender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-bred , extremely clever , and yet slightly racy all at the same time . Her plain tweed suit was impeccable ; she wore not an atom of jewelry , even on her hands ; her gray eyes were frank and humorous ; yet Andy was conscious that , spicing the permanent leather and tobacco smell of his library , there was now a faint wisp of something not unassociated with a stage dressing room . From any or all of these things the visitor might still be one of Molly 's ex-Junior League friends , but Andy had an instant feeling that in some way or other she was also a public figure . He was right , as Molly was already bursting to explain . " Andy , you remember hearing me talk about Fay de Rd . We spent that marvellous week-end together at Susan Steiner 's  --  the time all those opera people were there . " " Oh , yes  --  yes , indeed , " lied Andy . " How do you do , Miss de Rel ? " The gray eyes opposite him mocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , Mr. Payson ? " Miss de Rd 's voice was just what might have been expected . It was low and contained but had a rather captivating husk at unexpected moments . " And then , " Molly rattled on , " you remember that we tried to hear her speak over the radio , but someone had taken out one of the tubes . " " Yes , I remember very well , " replied Andy . He also remembered  --  nowwho had taken out the tube . " I was positively shattered , " mourned Molly , " because really , Andy , she 's the most marvellous person . " " Oh , please , please , " begged Miss de Rd . " I 'm nothing of the sort . " But you simply are ! " insisted Molly . She turned back to Andy . " She organized a social-information bureau all of her own and , practically singlehanded , she organized the national independent association of women 's clubs . And now she 's come up here specially to organize ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down . " He was beginning to feel a little faint . Miss de Rel and Andy sank with equal willingness into leather chairs but Molly , still rigid with excitement , could do no better than perch herself on the edge of the ottoman . " Honestly , Andy , " she continued to exclaim , " I think it 's the most marvellous idea I ever heard of ! You know that people who live in the country have nothing to do in the wintertime ? " " Oh , I would n't say that , " protested Andy , cautiously . " We have to keep putting chains on our cars and taking them off again . " " You do n't , " laughed Molly . " You just leave the car in the mud and send for a wrecker . But , seriously , Andy , take a day like this . What in the world is there to do except go to a movie or hang round the house ? " " But you like the movies , " said Andy . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , you know what I mean , " flared Molly . " I 've heard you say it yourself a dozen times . Sooner or later everyone who lives in a place like this gets infected with the village virus . Some days we do n't do one single thing except go for the mail . Now if people around here had something cultural in their lives ? " But Molly herself had not passed years in border warfare for nothing . She recognized perfectly well the lines of cloddish resistance that she saw developing in her husband 's face and figure . Her voice trailed off and she turned to her expert for help . " You tell him , Fay . You do it so wonderfully . " Miss de Rel 's laughing eyes had not missed a hair 's weight of the scene that was passing before her . Possibly she had seen the same sort of thing many times before . Tactfully she dallied until the musketry fire could die down . Reaching for a silver box on the table , she suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke from her cigarette drift up in slow , horizontal bars in the heavy heated atmosphere . When at last she turned to Andy it was with the easy , understanding air of one man of the world to another . " It is n't really as dreadful as it sounds , " she began . " And  --  forgive me , Molly , but the word ' culture ' was the very first thing that was banned by unanimous vote of the central commit-tee . " Andy relaxed slightly , but only slightly . All his outposts still remained on duty . " You sec , " continued Miss de Rel , " what with income taxes , high city rents , new forms of transportation , and so forth , there are certain farsighted people in New York who believe that the social future of America  --  the real social and  --  and ? " " Cultural ? " suggested Andy . Miss de Rel laughed with him . " You almost caught me . Let 's call it ' productive . ' These people believe that the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found more and more in the rural regions . And , assuming that that is so , they are interested in seeing that it develops in the right directions that people in the country are shown how to build the right kind of houses , preserve their own local folk traditions , yet become aware of the most modern and vigorous thought of cur times . " " Well , is n't that rather a long day 's work ? " murmured Andy . " Suppose they wo n't listen . " " Oh , they wo n't  --  at first , " agreed Miss de Rel . " It will take years and years of the most subtle campaigning . We do n't know yet whether it can best be done through books , through lee-MAGAZINE tures , through movies , or what . In fact , my job at the moment is merely to make a first , informal survey . I am going round just looking things over , to find out what people in the country are doing now , what they are talking about , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " asked Andy . " I 've often wondered . " " Well , to tell the truth , " confessed Miss de Rd , " this is the first place I 've tried . I only agreed definitely to take up this work last Thursday , but I remembered that Molly had talked fascinatingly about what she and her friends had already done to enliven rural life , so I decided that this might be an ideal place to begin . " " And it certainly is , " agreed Molly , stoutly . " We need it badly . " For some minutes she had been giving signs that the action was getting a little too slow for her tastes , so she gave it a shove . " You see , Andy , what Fay wants is to talk to a lot of different kinds of people  --  a leading farmer , a leading merchant , a leading minister , a high school teacher ? " " Key people ? " suggested Andy . His wife looked at him with something like awe . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the word that Fay used . " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Andy , modestly . " I suppose I was born for this sort of thing . " He looked at the windows and , as if the storm had been waiting to get his ordcrs , about five buckets of water rolled down the panes . " Of course , " volunteered Andy , " I 'll be delighted to do anything I can , but is n't this rather a poor sort of day to go looking for key people ? They 'd be hiding under stones or in hollow trees . " Miss de Rel was now laughing outright . " Do n't worry . My one thought at present is to find some nice little inn where I can put up until I get my bearings . " " My dear , good girl , you 'll do nothing of the sort , " protested Molly . " After that wonderful week-end do you suppose that I 'd let you stay anywhere except here ? I 'll go right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already on her feet but , since the campaign was apparently on , Andy saw no reason why he should not begin to pick up a few of its spoils and perquisites . " As for that , Molly , " he suggested , " Miss de Rel must have had a cold , damp ride . Do n't you think it would be an act of simple mercy to offer her a cocktail before lunch ? " Molly hesitated , for , lavish as she was with wine and spirits at her regular parties , she had never encouraged Andy 's individual experiments in that direction , especially before lunch . Still , a guest was a guest and the great Fay de Rel was the great Fay de Rd . " Why of course , " she assented weakly , " if Fay would like one , " but Andy had already seen the expression in Miss de Rel 's eye and was half way out of the room . " I 'll get the ice , " he called from the hall , " while Edwin brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray Miss de Rel was alone and apparently content to remain that way indefinitely . Her head was resting luxuriously on the low back of her leather chair , her feet were crossed and extended comfortably in front of her , while her eyes were gazing thoughtfully at the unlighted fireplace . At the sight Andy paused and a sudden warm feeling began to come over him . It was strange  --  it might be just his imagination  --  but never in his life had he seen anyone who sat in a chair so exactly in the way in which he did himself . Not even while he mixed the cocktails with subdued dexterity did the visitor speak or look up . Only when he had set her glass on the table beside her and lifted his own did she rouse herself , dutifully . She took one sip , then set the glass down again . " Mr. Payson , " she said , " I 'm afraid that you do n't like me very much . " " But I do ! " protested Andy . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen anyone with a more natural talent for chair-sitting  --  complete relaxation without sloppiness , contentment without indolence . With proper training you should go far . " Miss de Rel smiled . " I take it that that opinion comes from an expert . But , anyway , you do n't like my work . " " Do you like it yourself ? " ventured Andy . " A born chair-sitter like you ? " Miss de Rel. took another sip from her glass . " A girl must live , " she answered , " and occasionally buy a new pinny . " This side of the matter had apparently never occurred to Andy . " Do you mean to say , " he asked , " do you mean to say that people pay you for it ? " " Of course they do . If I did n't have my living to make do you suppose that I 'd ever stir out of my own apartment on a day like this ? I 'd simply put my feet on the radiator and make faces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair . " Why , that 's pathetic ! " he exclaimed . " That 's what I call real human tragedy ! I never realized that people went round organizing things because they had to . I thought it was just something funny in their blood  --  the way they might raise tropical fish or write letters to Hitler . " " It is with some of them , " admitted Miss de Rel , " but they 're mostly the people who put up the money . They get people like me to do the real work . Oh , please do n't think , " she added hastily , " that I do n't do a good job once I 've started . And I will admit that there are certain sides of it that arc pleasant . " " You 're very sporting , " blurted Andy , looking down at the carpet , " but to me it still seems just sheer , stark tragedy . " " What seems to you to be sheer , stark tragedy ? " demanded Molly , coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Miss de Rd was telling me , " replied Andy , " one of those hidden bits of human heroism that you only find out about by ac-cident . " Molly looked suspiciously from one to the other and then at the cocktail shaker . " Your phrasing is good , " she remarked , judicially , " but your tone is the one that you use when you 're trying to lie to me . Well , anyway , finish up your drinks . Lunch is on the table . " Andy seized the shaker with a great show of good will . " But are n't you going to have one ? " " Just a tiny sip , " said Molly , " just about half a one , " hut , as she always said that , Andy began to breathe normally again and , as usual , poured her a full glass . The unexplained incident seemed to have slipped off into oblivion , for at the luncheon table Molly and Fay dc Rel plunged at once into a vast sea of reminiscence : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you read in the papers what happened to him ? " while Andy was glad enough to be left in silence , for he found himself facing a new and not unamusing situation . If this had been one of his ordinary skirmishes , if , for example , it had been merely a case of Sylvia McGregor or Helen Perrier trying to persuade him to dress up as Santa Claus at the Christmas celebration , he would have known already how to act . But he could no longer regard Fay de Rel as one of his natural enemies . Her strange confession had shown that she was , in reality , one of the enslaved minority , just like himself , forced by necessity to be jerked hither and yon by the bustlers and organizers . At the same time he could not afford to encourage her hideous trade . If Molly ever found out how good he was at rooting up key people she would have him do it the rest of his life . Happily he was not forced to make a decision . As Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of campaign was tossed right into his lap and tossed , of all people , by Molly herself . After lunch Andy had gone up to his room and was fumbling round in his clothes closet when he became aware that Molly had followed him . Furthermore , although his back was toward her , something in the atmosphere told him that she had not come up looking for postage stamps . For a moment she remained staring blankly at the apparently empty room , then heard the rustling movements in the clothes closet . " What in the world , " she demanded , " are you doing in there ? " " I 'm looking for my little black pipe with the long stem , " replied Andy . " I had an idea that I left it in my evening clothes . " He fished the pipe out of a pair of braided trousers , which were hanging upside down on a rack , and walked into the open , displaying it on the palm of his hand . The completeness of his proof left Molly disarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Instead she gazed morosely at the broken lines of water which were dropping past the windows from the eaves . " I wonder , " she mused , " if it 's ever going to stop raining . " " I hope not , " said Andy . " The farmers need it . And , after all , we 've got pleasant company here , so what 's the odds ? " This was all the introduction that Molly required . " You and Fay , " she hinted , " seem to have got pretty chummy before lunch . " " I would n't have thought of that word , " answered Andy , " but I do agree with you that she 's a remarkable person . " " And she 's not exactly hostile to you , " pursued Molly , cautiously . " She said that she had never known anyone who could size up a person so quickly . She also said that there was a certain something in this house that she had never found anywhere else . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily . " For , you know , Molly , I suspect that life has not been any too easy for that young lady . " " Not too easy ! " exclaimed Molly . " What are you talking about ? Why ! people all over the United States arc just clamoring to get her . " " That may be so , " admitted Andy , " but , just the same , from what I gather ANDY AND THE she still has her own way to make in the world . " Molly laughed rather grimly . " I would n't worry about that . Susan Steiner tells me that she 's one of the highest-paid women in New York . She has an apartment like something out of the movies . " " Yes , she told me about that apartment , " said Andy dreamily . " ft sounds very snug . " " Yes , I imagine it would  --  to a man , " replied Molly . She spoke so sharply that Andy looked at her in amazement . " But , dearie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you liked Fay de Rel . " " So it 's got to the ' Fay ' stage , already ? " suggested Molly . Without waiting for an answer , she added , " Oh , I do like her  --  in a way , but she seems sort of different up here  --  kind of actressy . " Andy smiled to himself . " But one does n't mind that . In fact I 'd call it rather attractive . " Molly started to say something more , but Andy , with an air of intense preoccupation , was blowing through his empty pipe . He slapped the pockets of his jacket . " That 's brilliant ! " he announced . " Now that I have my pipe I seem to have left my tobacco pouch in the library . Are you coming down ? " Again Molly started to speak but Andy was waiting gallantly at the door and there seemed to be nothing to do but pass out ahead of him . In the library they found Fay in the same chair and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch , except that her head was a little farther back and her feet a little more extended . As the others entered she opened one eye in blissful content . " I 'm afraid , " she announced , " that I 'm getting the village virus . I do n't want to move , I do n't want to stir , I do n't even want to lift a finger  --  ever . " Andy looked down at her with a kindly professional air . " For two or three hours of just ordinary resting , " he commented , " that position is all right , but if you are going into this thing seriously  --  here , let me show you . " With one hand he dragged over the ottoman . With the other he lifted Fay 's ankles and placed them on it . He stood hack to survey his work . " There ! " he explained . " That is the position that is favored by all the Grade A sitters in the world , both chair and porch . It leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet at the same time it gives perfect support to the femur and the tibia . " Fay opened the other eye and looked up at him adoringly . " Maestro ! " she murmured . A deep , mid-afternoon silence began to settle down , enriched rather than broken by the pleasant tinkle of the raindrops on the piazza roof . With as few motions as possible Andy slipped into his own chair and lighted his pipe , but Molly began to walk restlessly round the room . She straightened an ornament on the mantel , plumped up a cushion , then wandered to the window , where she stood , looking out . " I 've got an idea , " she said without turning . Furtively Andy allowed his eyes to wander toward Fay but found that her eyes had already wandered toward him . A look of mute agony passed between them . " I suppose , " continued Molly , " that it is too stormy for you and Fay to go riding round the country , but why could n't we get three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better anyway . We could map out some sort of campaign . " Fay covered a yawn . " I 'm in your hands , darling , but please do n't take all that trouble just for me . " " It is n't any trouble . I 'd be glad to do it . " Molly 's words were honestly meant to be hearty but into her tone Andy 's practiced ear could detect that the first , faint loss of enthusiasm had begun to creep . If this were true the battle was as good as his . Furthermore , it would be the quickest victory that he had ever won . Still , it would n't do to push it too fast . Cautiously he signalled for his light cavalry to advance . " Just whom did you have in mind ? " he asked cautiously . " Whom were you going to ask ? " " Well , as a representative fanner , " said Molly , " we ought to have Mr. Paige . " " Excellent ! " agreed Andy . " Nobody else would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature this winter and wo n't be home until Thursday night . " " Well , then , for a merchant , " said Molly , " how about Sam Black ? " " Ideal ! " said Andy . " The only trouble is that his son is at home with a broken ankle and so poor Sam ca n't leave the store . " Molly 's voice had begun audibly to falter but she still kept valiantly on . " Then how about Mr. Lemore ? " " Only fair  --  for a proposition of this kind , " said Andy , but before he could think of any genuine disability for the poor hardware merchant , Fay came galloping to his aid . " Molly , dear , " she interrupted , " it 's terribly sweet of you to plan all this just for me , but , if you want me to speak frankly , it really would n't serve my purpose . What I want is to see these people in their own backgrounds  --  the farmer on his farm , the merchant in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people who come and go . If we asked them up here all at once they would become stiff and formal , just like any other committee . " I see , " said Molly , listlessly . " If it really would n't be of any help . . . " She turned back to the window , stood silent a moment , then pulled herself sharply together . " Well , if we ca n't do anything for Fay this afternoon why would n't it be a splendid time to hang those new curtains in the sewing room ? " " It would , " agreed Andy . " Perfectly splendid ! I 'll go up and help you . " Molly looked at him with an expression in which astonishment was followed by delight , for if there was one thing that Andy hated more than serving on a committee it was climbing up on chairs and nailing things to the walls . Nevertheless , his offer was perfectly honest , for , like all great generals , he knew how to treat a conquered people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Andy came down , alone , it was already dark . In fact it had been dark for some time . The hall lights were on and in the library there was a glow from a single shaded lamp . Fay was in the same chair , but now she was sitting bolt upright , thumbing through a copy of The spur . " And how is it going ? " asked Andy . Fay looked up at him and this time both eyes were wide open . " I 'm afraid that I 've got to disappoint you , " she answered . " As a chair-sitter I shall never be ranked in Grade A. It was wonderful for an hour or so , but now , all of a sudden , I 've begun to feel criminally active . I want to talk and laugh and generally do things . " " You need n't be discouraged , " said Andy , " because that is one of the curious phenomena of the sitter 's art . I myself have frequently noted that when the artificial lights go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ambitious . It may be a throw-back to some ancestor who was a night watchman . More probably it is because when the day is over all the other people are willing to sit down and be sensible . " Fay laughed softly . " Andy , you are absolutely priceless . You make me sorry that I am leaving to-morrow . " " Not to-morrow ! " exclaimed Andy . " Why ! to-morrow we 're going to burn up the roads , pin down merchants and farmers , and come back with big bags stuffed full of data . " " Oh , no , we 're not , " replied Fay . She rose slowly from her chair . " I 've thought up an excuse that will be perfectly smooth and plausible and I 'm leaving the first thing in the morning . " " But why ? " insisted Andy . " Is it because we did n't ' co-operate ' enough ? " " No , it 's not that , " said Fay . She glanced over her shoulder , then took hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I may be a professional pep woman but I 'm not a monster . In fact , I like to think of myself as a bit of an artist . When I see something that is absolutely perfect of its kind I know enough to leave it alone . If I ever saw you addressing rallies or filling out questionnaires it would be a nightmare that would haunt me to the end of my days . " " That 's a very decent way to put it , " murmured Andy , " but Molly will be disappointed not to have you stay . " Fay smiled a bit wickedly . " I 'm not so sure . You see , Molly has known me only when I was on vacation , with a bunch of saps . This is the first time she has ever really seen me at work . " Andy also smiled a bit wickedly . " At work at what ? " Fay patted the lapels of his coat , then dropped her hands . " What do you care ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out of this mess . " She stood a moment and listened but , although no steps were heard in the hallway , she turned away almost gayly . " Did n't someone say something about dinner at seven ? I 'd better go up and see how beautiful I can make myself . " " I 'll observe with interest , " replied Andy , " but make it a quarter of seven , if you do n't mind . The true chair-sitter loves to linger and dream over his cocktail  --  not guzzle and hop . " For several seconds after she had gone he stood without moving and again he was conscious that there was something in the room beside tobacco smoke and leather . He walked to the window and , as Molly had done , stood looking out . Fifteen feet from the house was a black wall of darkness but at the end of the piazza a small arbor vitae tree could be seen in the light from the room , bending steadily away from him . The wind was still strong . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant only one thing . Andy chuckled happily , as his knee touched a warm radiator . To-morrow also would be a rainy day .
