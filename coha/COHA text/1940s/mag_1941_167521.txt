At Harvard , students get their marks at year 's end , professors at its beginning . Harvard professors last week studied their ratings in a 25 pamphlet-the Crimson 's annual Confidential Guide to Freshman Courses . From the salty advice which the Class of 1944 hands on to the Class of 1945 , they learned how their students rated them and their courses . Traditionally , freshmen buy the book , take what they plan to anyway . But many a teacher has changed his plans , toughened his course , after a dose of the Crimson 's tonic . <P> Excerpts from the 1941 issue : <P> Sociology A : " While opinions of Pitirim Sorokin vary from crackpot to genius , he is still one of the commanding personalities at Harvard . ... It will do you no harm to hear Sorokin on Sorokin at least for half year . " <P> History I : " Paul Cram , the star of the staff , gives you an inspiring workout if you are up to it . ... Bradley Thompson , dull in section meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Economics A : " It would do well to include a little modern economics . . . . " <P> Fine Arts Ia : " Not a good course ; you put more in than you get out . " <P> English A1 : " The ability to polish the apple is a great asset . " <P> Greek A &; B : " This is one course concerning which there were no complaints . " <P> French E : " Avoid it if you possibly can . " <P> Military Science I : " Dull and factual , but war is n't tiddlywinks . . . . " <P> Astronomy I : " Astronomy is the one field in Harvard in which actual night laboratory work with Radcliffe is included in the curriculum . "
