Washington got a surprise this week when the House Un-American Activities Committee opened its investigation into Communism in Hollywood . It started with a thunderclap . <P> Balding Sam Wood , producer and director ( For Whom the Bell Tolls ) , had no hesitation in using the word Communist and in applying it to some of the cinema 's best-known writers : Donald Ogden Stewart , Dalton Trumbo and John Howard Lawson . But Wood was not content merely to pin the label on them . Said he : <P> " If I have any doubt that they are Communists , then I have n't any mind . I am convinced that these Hollywood Commies are agents of a foreign country . These Communists thump their chests and call themselves liberals , but if you drop their rompers you 'll find a hammer &; sickle on their rear ends . " <P> Director Wood then aimed a kick at the rear end of the Motion Picture Writers ' Guild , saying that it was " controlled by Communists . " As for the Screen Directors ' Guild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had a strong pro-Communist bloc , composed of Directors John Cromwell , Frank Tuttle , Edward Dmytryk and Irving Pichel . <P> Other witnesses told a similar story . Jack L. Warner , live wire of the Warner brothers , ticked off a list of scriptwriters he said he had refused to rehire because they were " suspected . " Trumbo and Lawson heard themselves named again . Others in Warner 's little Red book : Ring Lardner Jr. , Clifford Odets , Gordon Kahn , Howard Koch . Paunchy Louis B. Mayer , boss of <P> MGM , said he had three alleged Communists still on his payroll . He named . them as Stewart , Trumbo and Lester Cole . <P> As for Communist money , Sam Wood had his own idea of how they collected it . He referred to a Henry Wallace meeting in Hollywood , said that " Katharine Hepburn appeared and they collected $87,000 . You do n't think that money is going to the Boy Scouts , do you ? " <P> Chairman J. Parnell Thomas seemed delighted . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You really laid it on the line . You 've got guts . If every other man had the same courage you have , we would n't have to worry about Communism . " Unmoved by the opening lines of the drama were several of the accused and suspected writers and directors , sitting in the audience . They would get a chance to speak their lines later .
