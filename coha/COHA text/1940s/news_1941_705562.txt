txt Eleven shipbuilding plants in the San Francisco Bay area , holding $500,000,000 in contracts from the Navy and the Maritime Commission . were idle today after 1.200 machinists of the American Federation of Labor and 700 members of the Congress of Industrial Organizations went on strike at midnight . The walkout broke with the terms of a coastwise master agreement signed by A. F. of L. representatives and the shipbuilders on April 23 . There was no picketing over the week-end , but officials of the two striking locals said that lines would be established around all plants Monday morning . Between 15,000 and 20,000 workers of various trades are employed in the eleven plants . Despite telegraphed pleas from Frank Knox , Secretary of the Navy , and Rear Admiral Emory S. Land , chairman of the Maritime Commission , no negotiations had been begun , or were in prospect , to end the tieup . A.F. of L. and C.I.O. Split on Strike The strike has been repudiated by the Bay Cities Metal Trades Council , of which the striking A. F. of L. Machinists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , national president of the federation , and John P. Frey , president of the federation 's Metal Trades Division . But it has been approved by Philip Murray , president of the C. I. 0. , which was not directly represented in the negotiating of the master agreement , although Sidney Hillman , associate director of the Office of Production Management and a former vice president of the C. I. 0. , was one of the negotiators . The machinists are demanding a wage scale of $1.15 an hour for a 40-hour week , with double time for overtime . The master agreement provides for $1.12 an hour for a 40-hour week , time and a half for overtime on weekdays and double time for Sundays and holidays . The old agreement , which expired April 1 , was for $1 an hour for a 40-hour week and double time for overtime . Since the yards all had been working on a five-day week Until a week ago , the question of overtime was not a factor . Frank Fox , chief engineer of the General Engineerng and Drydock Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the shipbuilders had no alternative but to abide by the master agreement , which they signed in good faith . " There will be no lockout , " he added . " Our doors will remain open for any one who wants to work . We stand by our promise , as contained in the agreement , that there should be no stoppage of work in a labor dispute . " Master Pact Protested E. F. Dillon , business agent of Local 68 , said its position was that local autonomy had been violated by A. F. of L. national officials in approving a contract without a referendum of the rank and file . When the master agreement was up for consideration in the local metal trades council , a membership meeting of Local 68 voted against it , 827 to 67 . The members of Local 68 employed in inland machine shops recently won a contract after a threeweek strike providing for $1.15 an hour and double time overtime . The strike was settled on the union 's terms after a suggested agreement of the national mediation board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been rejected by the union . " Why should 1,200 of our members work under a contract that is less favorable to them than one we won by strike action for 2,500 others ? Mr. Dillon asked , and added : " The time has not yet come when working men ca n't quit their jobs , individually or collectively . " He contended that the local was not bound by the coastwise agreement because it was not represented on the negotiating committee . A joint statement by the C. I. 0 . councils of San Francisco and Oakland asserted that the agreement was reached " as a result of secret negotiations and collusion between the shipyard employers and John P. Frey , president of the Metal Trades Department of the A. F. of L. ; Dan Tracy , Assistant Secretary of Labor , and Sidney Hillman , co- director of the Office of Production Management . " The statement went on to say that the shipbuilders were making unconscionable profits out of their contracts with the government and that the workers should have a share . In reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that their contracts with the Navy and the Maritime Commission , which are all they are working on at present , did not permit them to pass on extra labor cost and that they could not pay more than time and a half for overtime . All contracts were drawn on the basis of straight time , he stated , and the shipbuilders were going into Saturday production only because of the emergency . Some of them paid double time for work last Saturday to keep their plants going although others shut down . The situation tonight was that other A. F. of L. workers in the struck plants would go through the machinists ' picket lines Monday morning . A. T. Wynn , secretary of the Bay Area Metal Trades Council , said that the council had voted last night to " reaffirm " its stand on the coastwise agreement . Whether the rank and file of the workers would abide by their leaders ' decision remained to be seen . Although there were no picket . lines around the struck plants today , not enough workers reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both employers and union leaders that they had stayed away because they thought the plants I would be picketed . So far as known there has been no attempt by the Federal . Mediation Service of the Department of Labor to intervene . It has three representatives in the San Francisco area , but their office in the Customs House was closed today . One of the three mediators is busy on a cannery strike . The joining of forces by the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0 . machinists appears unusual , considering the belligerent relations existing elsewhere between the organizations . However , the local machinists of both camps have always cooperated and have honored each other 's union books , working side by side on many jobs . Generally the C.I.O. has confined itself to the east side of the bay and the A. F. of L. to the San Francisco shipyards . The shipyards affected are those of Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company , Columbia Machine Works , General Engineering , United Engineering and Matson Navigation Company , all in San Francisco , and the Moore Drydock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alameda plant , Parker Boat Shop , Harbor Launch and Tug Company and Pacific Drydock.
