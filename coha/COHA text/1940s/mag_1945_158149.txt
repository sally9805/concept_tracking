On a South Pacific island , playing ball for a ist Marine Division regimental team , Pfc . George E. Benson Jr . lifted a high foul out past third base . A Stinson grasshopper artillery spotting plane was coming in to land . The ball crashed through the windshield , broke the pilot 's jaw and knocked him unconscious . <P> The Stinson 's only passenger , a Marine corporal , had never flown a plane . With the dual controls , he managed to pull the light plane out of its dive . After he had sweated out 30 minutes of level flight , the pilot came to and landed on another island , 15 miles away .
