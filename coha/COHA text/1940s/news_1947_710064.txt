txt Indicating Hotel Fire Escapes F. S. WITTENBERG pg . 18 Letters to The Times Indicating Hotel Fire Escapes To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORIc TWEET : Every time I enter an out-of-town hotel  --  and I do so about three times a week  --  and am shown to my room , I anxiously look down the long corridor in search of the sign " This is the nearest way to the fire escape . " I have yet to find such a sign . Many of the people I meet in hotels and trains speak of the great danger of hotel fires and the prospects of escaping unscathed , but no one seems to care to do anything about meeting the problem . Only the other week , when I inquired of the employe who was showing me to my room where the fire escape was located , he did not know . ? I suggest that on each floor of every hotel clear signs should be placed , directing guests to the fire escape . So far , although the newspapers report small and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct the menace . F. S. WITTENBERG . New York , Jan. 5 , 1947.
