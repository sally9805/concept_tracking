Last week Tip Reynolds was under arrest again , this time in jail . Tip Reynolds came from Michigan . A husky , amiable six-footer , he went to Montana in 1902 , when he was 20 . A lineman by trade , he spent most of his life electrifying railroads in the West . <P> Three years ago , at 55 , Tip Reynolds started a newspaper . Printed on a violent , near-red shade of newsprint , the Pink Reporter turned out to be a two-fisted , name-calling , muckraking fortnightly . Tip Reynolds first fell afoul of the law when he went after John E. Kennedy , secretary to ex-Congressman Jerry O'Connell ( who is now himself a " liberal " publisher ) . Charged with criminal libel , punishable in Montana by a $5,000 fine or a year in jail , Editor Reynolds hid out for a while in the hills , finally showed up , printed a retraction , and the charges were dropped . <P> Lately the Pink Reporter had heckled Governor Roy Ayers , who took office four years ago with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A mild-mannered Lewistown lawyer and Democrat , Governor Ayers enjoys a drink as much as any man . <P> Said the Pink Reporter recently , " The Ayers tribe are skunky eggs . For instance , Ben Moulton , now a member of the grafting state liquor crooks ... by the grace of a drunken so-called governor , State Senator Dale Woods . . . and one L. M. A. Wass . . . are all former chums of Whiskey Ayers , and all just as corrupt , including State Senator H. H. ' Haywire ' Haight . " <P> Ayers and his friends read these sizzling words , saw pink . The Governor himself swore out and signed a warrant charging that this was criminal libel . Complainants : Governor Ayers , Ben Moulton , Senator Woods , Senator Haight . Tip Reynolds was arrested at Three Forks , taken to Bozeman , 30 miles away , locked up in the Gallatin County jail . <P> There , last week , Editor Reynolds , in a spacious cell that looked out on one of Montana 's traveling gallows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed . It has been farmed out to various print shops in Montana , now comes ( according to rumor ) from a press somewhere in North Dakota . Not a copy was to be found last week on Montana newsstands . But in his cell in Gallatin County jail was a long table covered with pencils and copy paper , and Tip Reynolds at week 's end was busily editing his next issue .
