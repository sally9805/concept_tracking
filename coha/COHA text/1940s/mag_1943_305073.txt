<P> A traditional title that goes with the job of U.S. Comptroller General is " Watchdog of the Treasury . " The Comptroller , grizzled , paunchy Lindsay Carter Warren of North Carolina , is proud of the title . He is also justly proud of his reputation in the House of Representatives as a dead-earnest , last-ditch supporter of the Congress ' Constitutional right to examine the way the Administration spends every last penny of the people 's money . <P> False Teeth . Last week the House Military Affairs Committee listened while Lindsay Warren recited a long list of reasons why his General Accounting Office should have the final say on a most difficult postwar problem that is already here : what to pay war contractors when their war contracts are terminated . GAO , he said , had already found 270 " extraordinary " items among the charges allowed by the War Department in its cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts . Among the most extraordinary : <P> &gt; The cost of Christmas greetings and other personal telegrams and cables , juke boxes , vitamin pills , valet services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " <P> &gt; $10,000 for cognac , gin , rum and Scotch for a North Ireland officers ' club , with no offsetting credit for resale of the liquor ; other charges running into the millions for refundable items or for goods on which the price was later reduced . <P> &gt; Wages for a " 41-hour " work day for a single employe ; transport charges for taking an employe 's wife to a maternity ward ; $1.39 for shipping another employe 's dog . <P> False Teeth Explained . " I could go on ad infinitum and ad nauseam , " cried Watchdog Warren , " . . . and yet the War Department says we have no right to challenge these things . " <P> Promptly the War Department challenged his figures : GAO , said Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson , " had actually disallowed less than 10 per $1,000 " on Army contracts ( or $100,000 per billion dollars ) . He said that 90% of Lindsay Warren 's 270 items had either been detected and disallowed by the Army itself or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Patterson , were due to a Navy-not Army-order that a contractor 's technicians take an extra pair along to Russia ( together with extra glasses ) because such medical minutiae are unobtainable there . " While I hold no brief for the dog , " concluded Judge Patterson , " does an item of $1.39 really justify a charge of incompetence ? " <P> Watch Dog in a Fix . Last week 's exchanges on dogs and false teeth were merely the first public flicker of an intergovernmental fire that has smoldered underground for months . The Army-speaking for all Administration contracting agencies-has fought to establish its absolute right to terminate war contracts once &; for all on its own terms , precisely because it fears that GAO 's meticulous audits would " go on ad infinitum . " Already in this war $5.9 billion in contracts have been cancelled , as military needs changed . Come peace , some $75 billion , 100,000 prime contractors and more than 1,000,000 subcontractors will be involved .                @ @ @ @ @
