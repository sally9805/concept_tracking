HUNGARY <P> Agitated and filled with foreboding , Archbishop Joseph Mindszenty hurried into the Vatican just three years ago . He was a week late ; the Red army had held up his visa . <P> Next day Pope Pius XII placed the flat red cardinal 's hat on the head of peasant-born Joseph Mindszenty and 31 other prelates . As he did so , the Pope pronounced an ancient formula : <P> " Receive . . . this red hat , the sign of the unequaled dignity of the cardinalate , by which it is declared that thou shouldst show thyself intrepid even to death by the shedding of thy blood , for the exaltation of the blessed faith . . . " <P> Later , according to an account given by American priests , the Pope said to Mindszenty : " You may be the first to see these blood red colors turn to red blood . " <P> Historically , it was curious to find mention of martyrdom retained in the ritual creating a cardinal . The church 's list of martyrs contains scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved ( probably in the 5th Century ) , the cardinals were in charge of important churches in and around Rome . Yet while there was evil in the world , there would be danger , even at the center of Christendom . The cardinals were reminded that they as well as those who went among the infidel were expected to be faithful unto death . <P> The church in Rome of which Cardinal Mindszenty became titular head was Monte Celio 's 5th Century rotunda of St. Stephen the first martyr ( about 50 A.D. ) . * On the walls of St. Stephen 's are 34 frescoes showing scenes of Christian martyrdom-St . Margaret , her breast torn with hooks ; Bishop Artemius , crushed between stone slabs ; Bishop Simeon cut to pieces with knives . But not all martyrdom involves death . One fresco at St. Stephen 's tells of a 4th Century persecution of Christians by King Unericus in North Africa . The description reads : " Those who talked and raised their hands against the king had their tongues and hands cut off . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of martyrdom hanging over him . He knew it and talked about it , and said he was ready to accept it . He even prepared for the form of martyrdom that overtook him last week , the martyrdom devised by King Unericus-the martyrdom of the tongue that could no longer clearly profess that to which he had dedicated his life . <P> The Communists , who have their own martyrs , well understand the saying " Blood of martyrs , seed of the church . " They sought to remove Mindszenty , who stood in their way , but above all they sought to cheat him of his martyr 's crown . Thus last week Mindszenty appeared in court , " confessing " and " recanting . " <P> How the Communists managed it no one in the West knows . ( To this day no one knows the secret of the 1937 purge trial confessions in Russia . ) Somehow they broke Joseph Mindszenty , man of burning courage . Somehow they made him say things he had denied with the utmost vehemence , and with full knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
