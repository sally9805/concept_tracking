txt Six men accused of being members of two separate narcotic peddling groups in Harlem were indicted yesterday following their arrest Tuesday night . Among them was Charles ( Little Bullets ) Albero , associate of Joseph ( Joey ) Rao and Michael ( Trigger Mike ) Coppola , material witnesses in the Joseph Scottoriggio murder . Each of the six men was named on two counts in the indictments , one for alleged sale of narcotics and one for alleged conspiracy to sell narcotics . All are to plead before Judge Francis L. Valente in General Sessions Court today . District Attorney Frank Hogan and Garland H. Williams , district supervisor for the Federal Narcotics Bureau , said the Harlem narcotic syndicates had a virtual monopoly in this illicit traffic almost everywhere east of the Mississippi River . Records taken from Albero 's files , Mr. Hogan said , indicated that the Albero group alone had sold more than $150,000 worth of heroin in the last two months . Grew Out of Murder Inquiry The arrests , Mr. Hogan said , ' grew out of the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker who was beaten near the polls in East 104th Street in Harlem last election day . Mr. Hogan pointed out that he had asserted during recent court proceedings that Rao and Coppola had a business interest in narcotics and that " Bullets Albero is sometimes described as one of Coppola 's lieutenants . " As the indictments were handed up Assistant Chief Inspector Frank Fristensky Jr. , named in the police shake-up last week to reorganize the force in Harlem and all Manhattan East , was calling on his men to " keep the racketeers flowing toward the courts . " The Tuesday night catch of alleged narcotic peddlers was a major start in this direction . Between them the six prisoners had records totaling close to ninety arrests . One of the two groups taken Tuesday night included Albero , who is 44 years old and lives at 2390 Tiebout Avenue ii the Bronx ; Armand Angelo Piragnoli , 34 , of 2391 First Avenue , and Nicholas Gnazzo. 46 , of 345 East 112th Street . The second group include . Joseph ( Pip the Blind ) Gagliano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loiacano , 37 of 226 East 107th Street , known also as Puggy , and Anthony Lucente of 339 East 119th Street . District Supervisor Williams said all six of these men , most of whom have multiple arrests on their records , are members of the so-called " Young Mafia " of Harlem . He said they were the current version of the original Unione Siciliano , the black-hands of Sicily . " They sneer at the outworn methods of the Old Mafia , " Mr. Williams explained . " Where the older men worked with bombs and threats and direct violence , the Young Mafia rely on ' connections , ' bribery and political corruption . " Long Under Surveillance Although the narcotic peddlers worked unmolested in Harlem before Police Cbmmissioner Arthur Wallander ordered a drastic shakeup in the force there last week , Supervisor Williams ' men had had the members of the Young Mafia under surveillance a long time . " Actually , " he explained , " my men were in there long before the Scottoriggio case . We knew that the peddlers in that district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by motor car through California , and from there by train to Harlem . " The narcotic brought from Mexico , Mr. Williams said , was pure opium . It came into Harlem in that form and was processed in the Young Mafia 's chemical laboratories , first into morphine , then into heroin , the form in which it was finally sold . The Albero syndicate , according to the accusation in the indictments , was selling heroin at $350 an ounce , while the second group , headed by Gagliano , according to the police , was getting only $315 an ounce . The Albero syndicate was accused of specific sales totaling four ounces , between Dec. 2 and Dec. 9 of this year . and the Gagliano group of specific sales , to a total of five ounces , on Dec. 11 and Dec. 12 . Twenty-seven Arrests Since 1911 Albero 's record , officials said , shows twenty-seven arrests dating back to 1911 but in most of the cases he managed to wriggle free . He was involved in the shooting of Patrolman Hugh Clark in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1927 . On Feb. 19 of that year he was sentenced to forty years in prison , but this sentence was reversed . In 1929 he was sentenced to serve seven and one-half years for burglary and eventually landed in the Great Meadow Prison . A scandal developed in 1932 when his father , Annello Albero , accused Felix Solomon , a Tammany worker in Harlem , of having accepted $4,000 to have " Bullets " released from Great Meadow . Solomon pleaded guilty to this charge before the late General Sessions Judge John J. Freschi . It developed , at this time , that " Bullets , " brought down from the prison ostensibly as a witness , was roving the streets , dining at hotels , living the good life like any free man . " Bullets " Albero was arrested in Joey Rao 's company on March 27 , 1936 , at Lexington Avenue and 110th Street . Both were then accused of vagrancy . Gagliano , the police said , ranked second to Albero in length of police record . He was picked up twenty-two times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a penitentiary term in 1921 for stealing automobile tires . In the spring of 1942 he was sentenced to nine months in the Danbury , Conn. penitentiary for violation of the Federal Narcotic Law . Third on His Police Record Gnazzo ran third on police record , with eighteen items against his name , according to the police . He served ninety days in Jersey City in 1928 as a disorderly person , paid a $25 fine on a policy Islip charge in June , 1939 , and was fined $1.00 a gambling charge in July , 1940 . Supervisor Williams , Mr. Hogan and Harlem police officials alike agreed that the six arrests were the fruit of perfect cooperation between their respective departments . They hinted at the possibility of further arrests in the narcotics deals . The arrests were good news to Inspector il'ristensky 's new command . Several hours . after they had been made the inspector talked to . hip commanding officers , as he put it . " hard and to the point . " He said he wanted the territory cleaned of criminals . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and get to know all you can about wha is going on . I want no shirking . Suppress the criminal types and criminal acts , but at the same time protect the business men and honest residents  --  and they 're in the majority here  --  to the Niles ' extent .
