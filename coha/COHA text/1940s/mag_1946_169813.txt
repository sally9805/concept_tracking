The dingy courtroom in London 's Grosvenor Square was crowded with G.I.s . On its 48th day , the trial of a prison guard from the U.S. Army 's loth Reinforcement Depot at Lichfield was still a big attraction for men who remembered the planned brutalities , the beatings , the dosing with castor oil , which had made Lichfield infamous ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) . <P> Half an hour late , in strode imperious Colonel James Alphonse Kilian , former commandant of the depot . In barrel-organ tones he demanded to see the order convening the court . The president banged his gavel to silence the belligerent witness . Kilian called for a comfortable chair- " one with arms on it if I have to sit here all day . " <P> Fourteen times during five hours , the gavel was slammed to bring the witness to order . Once Kilian stretched , looked at the prosecutor and stuck out his tongue . Said a G.I. onlooker : " I 'd like to see one of us act like that ! " <P> Kilian indignantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lichfield stockade-where other witnesses had testified that the beatings were a regular , daily occurrence , carried out on Kilian 's own orders . Once he flatly refused to answer a direct question , and the court cited him for contempt . <P> Meanwhile , in Washington , the War Department sent up , and the Senate confirmed , a list of 349 officers for promotion ( based on seniority ) to the permanent rank of colonel . Among the names : James Alphonse Kilian . Then the Washington Post drew attention to the goings-on at the Lichfield trial . Embarrassed , Utah 's Elbert Thomas got the Senate to call the list back . If the Army was embarrassed , it showed no sign .
