ORIGINAL SIN ( 195 pp. ) - George Tabori-Houghfon Mifflin ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> Gifted Hungarian-born George Tabori , whose Companions of the Left Hand was one of last year 's most singular and striking novels ( TIME , June 24 , 1946 ) , seems to have written this psycho-thriller with his left foot . A khamseen howls for days in Cairo , wearing tempers thin as the hot , gritty sand seeps through the doors and windows of the Pension Malika Farida . On the fifth morning of the storm , Adela Manasse , wife of the pension 's proprietor , is found dead in her tub , naked and smiling a " kindly " smile . How did she die and why did she smile ? Original Sin explores this problem amid swirls of windblown sand and snarls of plot typical of Cosmopolitan magazine fiction-which is , in fact , what this novel is.
