Hue &; Cries <P> Sirs : <P> A specter is haunting the editors of TIME , Inc . A " Red Terror " has cast its shadow over . . . TIME scribes and blotted from their beings the simple elements of truth and reason . . . . <P> ( CPL . ) MARTY SOLOW Tyler , Tex . <P> Sirs : <P> ... Of all the Bolshevik weekly mags and monthly rags that I have ever come in contact with , yours is certainly the reddest . I can see why you have that vermilion border around it ! . . . <P> G. ALEXANDER LEGMAN New York City <P> War Dogs <P> Sirs : <P> . . . The story , " The K-gs Come Home " TIME , Dec. 3 , contains three . . . inaccuracies . . . . <P> 1 ) The dog Rex , reported as having attacked a 65-year-old woman of Japanese extraction in Albany , Calif. , was not fresh from " a year and a half as a combat dog in the South Pacific . " Rex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active duty and spent his entire career in the Army at the War Dog Reception and Training Center , Fort Robinson , Neb . . . . <P> 2 ) The only dogs that the Army could not retrain for return to civilian life were all dogs which were found unsuitable for military training . . . . <P> 3 ) The Army has never trained dogs to be " killers . " Several so-called attack dogs were trained early in the war purely for exhibition purposes but the only dogs serving on active duty were scout dogs , messenger dogs and sledge dogs . . . . <P> ALENE ERLANGER Special Consultant to the Quartermaster General Washington <P> Jnproved Charge <P> Sirs : <P> I was surprised to find TIME lending its talents to give added currency to unproved charges , without so identifying them in the paragraph on cemented tungsten carbide , in the Nov. 19 issue . That paragraph said : <P> " When the U.S. General Electric Co. and the German Krupp interests made an agreement on the sale of cemented tungsten carbide ( for machine tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which raised the price from $50 a pound to $453 . After the U.S. Government indicted G.E . in 1940 ( antitrust law violation ) , the price skidded to $32 a pound . " <P> Even though the statement was made by a Canadian Government official , its present status is a charge in a lawsuit which has not been tried , a charge which General Electric denies . . . . <P> R. S. PEARE Vice President General Electric Company Schenectady , N.Y . <P> Right . The charges are still untried. - ED . <P> Black Beauties <P> Sirs : <P> . . . If there is any one word in the English language which expresses just the opposite of Black Hills mountain country conditions it is the word " bleak . . . . " The name Black Hills came from the rich , deep green of the giant ponderosa pine forests covering them ; trees more than 200 years old , lifting their tops 150 feet or more into the blue . Through these forests roam herds of deer , elk , antelope , bighorn sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game animals of the temperate zone . Throughout this area are numerous crystal-clear mountain streams and sylvan lakes , thronged with an ever-increasing supply of the gamiest mountain trout found anywhere . The entire area is vibrant and teeming with a variety and abundance of life . . . .
