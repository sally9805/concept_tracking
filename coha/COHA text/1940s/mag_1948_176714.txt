More than a few of the 3,000 members of the National Association of Manufacturers , gathered for their annual convention in Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel last week , felt like small boys worrying about a trip to the woodshed . None knew how vindictive or friendly toward business the Truman Administration would be . But Secretary of Commerce Charles Sawyer would tell them ; he was due to give a speech which President Truman had read and approved . <P> Just the sight of Sawyer in the glittering banquet hall made the N.A.M.s feel better . With his grey hair , rimless spectacles and prim manners he looked exactly like the businessman he once was . When Earl Bunting , N.A.M . chairman , introduced him as " a fellow whose mother probably called him Charlie , " Sawyer smilingly set him straight : " My mother called me Charles . " <P> From then on , it was plain that Sawyer had come to extend the hand of fellowship to businessmen . Though the talk was vague on taxes , controls , etc. , Sawyer hoped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... to make the greatest use of our energies and our resources . " <P> Ignition System . It was true , he said , that if military spending is increased much more , taxes might have to be boosted . Also , the voluntary allocation program of scarce materials might have to be extended to other products besides steel . But business is not in the doghouse . <P> Said Sawyer : " I am a believer in private enterprise . . . Government officials should remember that businessmen are working for profits . Profit ... is the ignition system of our economic engine . The importance of profit must be recognized and utilized . Government should assume that businessmen are honest and have the welfare of the country at heart . Many people are inclined to think that businessmen are tough , selfish and hardboiled . In my experience , I have found them to be no more tough and selfish than any other group . " <P> While some companies had shown " admirable restraint " in holding down prices , others had raised prices more than justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful and thoughtful consideration to the inflationary effect of large profits and unreasonably high prices . " Although the economy was turning out more than ever , " more and cheaper consumer services " are still needed . " As long as these needs exist , we should not worry about having a ' mature ' economy . We still have a frontier to push forward . " When it was over , one delegate commented : " This was a damn good speech . I say that , and I 'm an old Tory ! " <P> Utah Pies . The atmosphere of sweet reasonableness was so pervasive that N.A.M . brought forth none of the resolutions that often raise the hackles of more liberal businessmen . It contented itself with a mild request that the U.S. budget be held to a $37 billion ceiling , and a plea for a " readjusting " of income taxes . It listened politely to the demand , by Chrysler 's B. E. Hutchinson , for a return to the gold standard , but gently pigeonholed it .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
