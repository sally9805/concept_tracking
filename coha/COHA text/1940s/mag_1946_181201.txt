Ever since the Big Four 's armies invaded Germany , Russia and the western Allies have waged a desperate undercover battle for Germany 's most valuable scientific workers and technical secrets . By last week that struggle was nearing its end- for each victor nation had corralled about all the German brains it could get hold of . <P> Life at Sukhum . When the Reds punched into Berlin , they threw a cordon of troops around the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute , whence the news of uranium fission had first startled the scientific world in 1939 . They went down into the cellar , dismantled the big cyclotron , packed it carefully off to Stalinland . Among the men they carried off was Baron Manfred von Ardenne , 39 , a brilliant physicist . <P> Last week the baron and about 130 of his brainy countrymen were at Sukhum , on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus . Well-fed , well-paid and well-treated , they live in a comfortable manor house , surrounded by palm trees and fragrant eucalyptus gardens . A mile away is their laboratory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues on an intensive program of atomic research . <P> Rival Hunters . When the Americans and British entered Germany , they had special teams ready to pounce on any likely-looking technician , piece of apparatus , scrap of paper . These teams , mostly directed by FIAT ( Field Information Agency , Technical ) , were considerably better organized than the Russian brain-hunters . The U.S. had no immediate need of atomic help , since it was already pointing for Hiroshima , but it wanted to keep German atom workers away from the Reds . The U.S. did want help with rockets and guided missiles . <P> In both nuclear physics and guided missiles , the Russians probably got the greatest number of workers , but the U.S. got some of the top men . On the whole the U.S. ( abetted by Britain and France , which got smaller shares ) did rather well . The U.S. disdained reparations in money and goods-but not in brains .
