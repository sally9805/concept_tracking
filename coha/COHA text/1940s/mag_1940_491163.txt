0 ONE knows exactly how many Germans there are in Mexico . But if our experience , living for several years in one of the largest c'ties of Mexico , is any indication , there are more Germans in Mexico than there are Americans . They certainly do a much better job of learning how to adapt themselves than we do . The Germans are in Mexico to stay . Before we made our home in Mexico , we had spent several years in China as teachers . Having an incurable curiosity about other people and a desire to know them better is probably what has kept my husband wandering over the face of the earth . He knows Germany well , and it was natural for him to make contacts with the Germans whom we found when we went to live in Mexico . We did n't meet very many Americans at first . Their social groups were well formed . No one was interested in newcomers . Besides , being so close to his own country does not give the American businessman or his wife any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there to make money . The wife makes a home as best she can , but she seldom moves out of her own social group . Often , she does not even learn to speak Spanish . As soon as possible the Americans , for the most part , go back home and stay there . With the German coming to establish himself in Mexico , it is quite different . As soon as possible he marries , builds a home , raises a family , provides a good German school for his children and , in every way he can , makes a real place for himself in the community where he lives . He expects to stay there for the rest of his life . Transplanted Teutons O - 13. experience began just ten years after the Great War . The depression had not quite arrived . Hitler was practically an unknown person . Mexico was peaceful and serene , with no revolution in sight . We had plenty of leisure , outside of our teaching hours , to find out what was going on around us . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who belonged to an English forum which we attended . She was an odd-looldng person ; muscular and lean , with a sort of emaciated fitness which gave her a tense , wiry manner . I soon found out why . " So you write articles , " she said , fixing me with her keen blue eyes . " Be careful what you say . You will probably write more than you know . All out siders do . My husband and I , who have lived here for ten years , still do not understand these people . " They were Social Democrats at this time , when the Nazi movement was just beginning to emerge on a. national scale . They were also members of a strict vegetarian sect , which has its organized renters in Los Angeles as well as in parts of Germany . Gretchen taught me as many of their ideas as I could understand . It was from this same cult that . Hitler took some of his theories . Gretchen used to express them this way : " Breathe deeply . Believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , so that you will hear the inner voice directing you . If you follow it and obey the order of the star under which you were born , you can not possibly fail in anything you really want to do . " The rest of the Germans were amused at Gretchen 's ideas , but even they had to admit . that she was certainly going places . For ten years she and her shell-shocked husband had not only made ends meet . with his small war pension but had managed to invest sonic of it . A few miles outside the city they had a bee farm , where the husband spent most of his time fighting off bandits and thieves . Gretchen stayed in the city to market the honey and carry on a business of her own . Their little house , on a quiet corner , did not stand out from the Mexican houses roundabout , except that every available inch of space , inside and out , had been put to work . Coffee trees , fruit trees , tomato ' plants , flowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a crowded patio . Gretchen scorned the idea of a servant , considered necessary by almost every self-respecting family in Mexico . Her house was spotless just the same , although this meant following the established custom of scrubbing all the tile floors every day on her hands and knees . The front rooms were pathetically bare , but the kitchen was a workshop , Tins of honey lined the walls . Piles of brown bread and ginger cakes stood ready for sale . Coffee beans were roasting in the oven . Most conspicuous of all was a shining cream separator , imported from t ; ermooy . C ; retchen had ( Continued on Pose 67 heard the American women complain about . the " sour " cream sold in Mexican markets , so she arranged with a dairy to buy their best . milk , separated the cream , which she sold to the Americans , and sold the skimmed milk to poorer Mexican families , who could n't afford anything else . She made almost as much money as her husband did with his bees . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vegetables and fruit juices  --  which left . me lightheaded and desperate after a brief experiment , with it  --  belief in herself and in her star had brought all this to pass . You will see ! " she said to me with earnest passion one day . " The time will come when all Germany will know this ! " Selling the Fatherland I could n't have accomplished anything without Clretchen 's help that first year . She took me to the German hardware store and helped me buy my pots and pans , my kitchen knives , dishes and silver  --  such as it was  --  for my dining-room table . When a Mexican senorita offered to make me a china pobtann , the national fiesta costume of Mexico , Gretchen took me to another German store , where we bought thread , spangles , embroidery floss and needles . She thought they were so much better than those imported front any other country . The reading lamp for my husband 's desk , the camera we used , the pump we installed for our school water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me buy from German stores . A friend of hers later gave us some lovely deerskins to use for cushions on our heavy cedar chairs . Gretchen knew a German who lived way off from the city , all by himself . He was trying to perfect a kind of honey wine , but in the meantime she was sure he could ( Continued front Page 29 ) dye those skins For us just the queer shade of blue which we insisted on having . And he did a perfect job , which lasted through years of hard usage . We were offered the use of a lovely old piano , sadly out of tune and in need of repair . The only person able to recondition and take care of it was Herr Muller from the German music store . This same concern helped me to find Mexican folk songs , imported an excellent , flute at very low cost for my husband , and provided the classical music used in two large conservatories . They were also agents for the phonograph records sent down from the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorations , tree ornaments and lights were used . Mexicans are dropping their quaint and picturesque pageant of the Nativity , and in its place is what they call an American Christmas , with a tree and decorations and toys and gifts in increasing number earls year . Practically all of these luxuries were imported from Germany . There were some twenty German business concerns in our city alone . These handled dyes , machinery , farm equipment. , electrical supplies , hardware and household articles , schoolbooks , luxury knickknaeks and leather goods , perfumes and drugs . It is difficult to name them all or to stress their importance sufficiently . Take drugs , for instance . Although there were several good drugstores in our city , certainly the best one and the most efficiently managed was German . It was always a breathless sort of pleasure to trade there , to step in from the slow leisurely tempo of life outside to the careful service within . A very good-looking young German man , tall and blond , had charge of the Mexican senoritas who clerked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from American tomato soup to the most modern injections . Mexicans cure everything hy injections , front colds or atomitchaches to deadly tropical fevers . So the German drugstore did ti rushing business , but I never found their clerks too busy to give me the most painstaking and careful attention . The morning our twins were born , ahead of time and under very trying circumstances , in our own home , we sent down past-haste for supplies from the Berman drugstore . Our doctor , by the wily , was Swiss , and very closely associated with the German colony . It was Gretchen who answered our call for help on that exciting morning and who took care of the new ba hies until a German nurse arrived from another city , 300 miles away . One of our most amusing contacts with the Germans had to do with planting grapevines and fruit trees in a large desert lot just behind our house . I wanted to transform it into a garden , but our old Mexican mo.7. , shook his head and said , " No , sehora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he opened his mouth and stared in gaping wonder when Gretchen called in a German agriculturist , who brought in his own chemIca ! fertilizer , planted vines or trees wherever I asked him to , and capped the climax by transplanting full-grown fruit trees from one spot to another . Our mow cursed and muttered under his breath that such things were I against nature . But the desert was blossoming like the rose , just the same . And , of course , the pump which supplied the water was German too . Is it ally wonder that the Germans were treated with respect and admiration in the Mexican pity where we lived ? Our first Christmas was spent on a German hacienda of 6000 acres , la rout in the country . And that , too . e owed to Gretchen . But before I go into that experience , it might he interesting to explain how German business got . its start in Mexico , ray fifty years ago . The Mother of the Foreigner At that time , Don Porfirio ' Diaz was dictator-president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1884 to 1911 . As a result of his policy , Mexico came to be called " the mother of the foreigner and the stepmother of the Mexican , " since it was he who invited foreign capitalists to Mexico and favored them with special concessions . The Germans , with their farm equipment and industrial machinery , were especially welcome . Ever since the time of the Spanish conquest of Mexico , 400 years ago , the upper-class Mexicans  --  landowners , business and professional men  --  have generally looked I to Europe , and not to America , for culture , education and social contacts . Even today this is true . It is still considered a lucky match when a charming senorita from some well-established family marries a young German who has come to Meideo to go into business , especially if he represents some large and prosperous firm back in the Fatherland . Well , then , a fine young German  --  and if he is a blond , so much the better  --  marries into an old Mexican At that moment the home becomes s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German men are excellent providers and faithful husbands , which means a lot in Mexico . So the wife gladly sets herself to learn German , to prepare German meals , to arrange the home according to German ideas . When children are born , the Mexican mother is as eager as her husband to have her children carry on the German tradition in Mexico . After the first few years at home , the child is sent to a German school , for there are German schools in all important Mexican cities . At the age of twelve , or thereabouts , the child is sent to Germany , where he remains for the rest of his school years and until his character is well formed . Then he returns to Mexico and carries on as his father did before him . But he is a German citizen , and can be claimed , in case of war , by the Fatherland . Children born of foreign parents in Mexico must be registered with the Mexican Government of course . When they are twenty-one , they may choose whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their father . It was impressed on me more than once how much German characteristics are admired in Mexico . Efficiency ; order , persistency and patience , self , discipline  --  these are the qualities the Mexican marvels at in the German , and craves to acquire , since he so often lacks them in himself . At least we heard that often enough among the middle-class Mexicans of the city . Out in the country it was different . As soon as Gretchen discovered that we wanted to learn something about rural Mexico . she had a plan fur us . " Spend Christmas with the Nagel family . Their hacienda is one of the largest iu the state . . . What does it matter if you do n't know them ? I 'll arrange that . " The Flying Table And so , the day before Christmas , trined with spray gnus and a plum pudding , we pulled out of the city on it early-morning train . Until late afternoon we wound leisurely over the wide , fertile plains of Central Mexico , lush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dropped down into the deep canyons , or barrooms , which led toward the tropical west coast . When the conductor realized where we were going , he said , sucking in his breath between his teeth : " Bad place to reach , that hacienda ! If they send a servant with burros and you have to ride over the mountain , you wo n't reach the place before midnight . But those Germans are smart . They 'll probably ride you up on their grain ' table . " That was vague enough . It was still worse when the train dropped us off in the heart of a deep chasm hidden between two high mountain plains . ' No servant appeared . We were won-I daring what to do next when a young man , very dark and Latin-looking , suddenly arrived out of nowhere . " I am Otto Nagel . " He looked too young to have charge of 6000 acres of land . And in spite of his German name , his whole bearing was Mexican . We rode up the mountain on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used for carrying loads of rice down to the train . A platform , suspended by chains from a heavy cable overhead , was the table . It had no sides . Another table , on the plateau far above us , was loaded with grain sacks . As soon as we were ready on our table down below in the valley , a signal was given and up we went , swinging 600 feet through the air on a table top with no sides . I clung to the chains . My husband swung his legs over the edge and kept talking about the view . Don Otto Nagel , silhouetted against a lavender sky , stood nonchalantly and watched the other load drop past us into the valley below . When we reached the upper plains , a tall middle-aged German caught our ropes and pulled us into the grain shed . " This is Herr Bachmann , " our host explained . We learned later that he was the foreman of the hacienda . Ile was also Don Otto 's father-in-law . Stepping Into Christmas We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high sugar cane until we came to a nest of buildings surrounded by a high adobe wall . The entrance gate was opened just long enough for the truck to pass through and deposit us at the doorway of a large hacienda house . Close by was a very modern factory well equipped with German machinery . The main crop of the place was sugar cane , and the miffing was done there too . Other German haciendas specialize in tequila  --  Mexican whisky  --  rice , coffee and flour . All are well equipped with imported machinery . Don Otto 's wife , and her mother , Frau Bachmann , hurried us into the main patio of the house . " We have kept the Christmas celebrat  --  on waiting for you , " they said . Then we were led down a long corridor , where the families of the 100 peons who farmed the place stood waiting . Two younger Bachmann children  --  a boy about six , and his twelve-year-old sister  --  began to sing : " Sidle Nada , hcilige Nuchi . " The drawing-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a mountain of lights shimmering from the Christmas tree , which looked as though it had been imported from Germany for this OCCD , sion . The little girl ran forward with a low cry to kneel beside the creche at the base of the tree . Her father had brought those little Nativity figures from the Fatherland twenty-six years before . He had never been back since . Each family of peons was given a large shoe box . So were we , and when I opened mine 1 found it filled with homemade German cookies . " Where in the world did these come from ? " I cried . The two German women smiled . " We made three barrels full of them this year , " they said . " One must begin early in November in order to finish on time . " Such industry was typical of the whole hacienda . Don Otto 's father , the former owner of the farm , had come over from Germany during the days of Don Porfirio Diaz to import farm machinery into Mexico . His payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled 12,000 acres . He married a Mexican wife and raised a large family . Had they stayed in the city , all would have gone well . German efficiency is admired there . With the Indians working the farm lands , it is a different thing . What did it matter to them that their German hacendado kept them from spending their money for tequila ? They hated him for it . His Prussian discipline may have been just , but its only effect on the Indians was to make them bate him and bide their time . During the revolution , on a trumped-up accusation , he was shot down in the corridor of his hacienda , and the young son left in charge . A year later some armed bandits came back after him . They did n't get him that time . But three years later , when Mexico was going through another phase of the revolution and the great hacienda lands were being confiscated , we met young Don Otto on the streets of our city . Ho had lost everything , and had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As time went on , we saw more and more of the Germans . They invited us to join their club , an unpretentious affair in a suite of rooms just above the main plaza . How many happy evenings we spent there , sitting around the small tables , sipping beer , laughing at German jokes , discussing the revolution in Mexico . At one party , when some prominent Germans were leaving the city , we were the only Americans invited to the farewell . I can see yet the long supper tables , laden with meats and salads and rich pastry . Sitting around it , arms linked , beer mugs held high , a hundred Germans swayed in unison while their strong rich voices sang German folk music . We were attending a bridge tea at the American Cub when I first heard the word " Hitler " in Mexico . As I said in the beginning , the American group kept more or less to itself . Few outsiders ever came to our weekly teas . We had arrived too late to play bridge and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German consul and his wife standing in the doorway . A few minutes later they joined us , and we began to ask them questions about their recent trip home to Germany . People who Live in foreign countries and go to the homeland only for occasional short trips always return to ? their adopted country with glorified exaggerations about what is going on at home . That is natural enough . But there was a strange sort of fanaticism in the Frau Consul 's voice , as she said , in a hall whisper : " Have you heard about our Hitler ? Do you know what be is doing for Germany ? " The Shadow of the Swastika That was the beginning . Time went on and different German families went home for short trips . In each ease , it was the same . Before they left Mexico they seemed to show little enthusiasm about Hitler and Nazi propaganda . But when they returned from the Fatherland , it was always : " You do n't understand . You hear the wrong things about Hitler . lle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . We have hopes now . We can hold up our heads at last and forget the Great War . " Their club lost its old informality . Conversations became fanatical and intense . Radio broadcasts across the ocean were perfected . Every German home in our city could get news directly from Berlin . Gretchen left suddenly for the United States and never returned to Mexico . There were rumors of spies in the community . All criticism of the home government ceased . Then the question of the Jews came up . One of the leading families of the German colony withdrew from the group . How unfortunate ! For many years the woman had mothered that German colony as well as her own large family . Now it was whispered that she had Jewish blood in her veins . We saw the effects of " Hitler in Germany " most of all in the German school . Just about that time the Mexican Government bad been passing laws which closed many of the private schools , which had flourished until then . Among other things , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come into the country  --  except as tourists , of course  --  examinations were given by the state , the state program was to be followed , religion was not to be taught . They were all perfectly good laws from the point of view of Mexican education , but they hit many private schools right between the eyes . The Patriarchal System For some strange reason which I have never been able to discover , nothing much happened to the German school . Teachers continue to come from the Fatherland , although in reduced numbers . A German headmaster is in charge . Even the Mexican teachers all tend to share the German point of view . When our children were of kindergarten age , there being no other good private school available , we sent them to the German school . " Iieil Hitler " was the morning greeting . At frequent intervals , Nazi propaganda movies were shown at the school . The education of the German boys and boys born of German-Mexican parents was speeded up , so that the students could be sent back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children from the school , a subtle rift appeared between us and our German friends . We went less and less to the club , and when we did go , there was a forced politeness , as well as great gaps in the conversation when politics and borne governments were mentioned . Only once , in his own garden , where we sat drinking coffee , did a German man express himself freely . " You will see , " he said quietly . " I am just back from Germany , and I know . France is no danger any longer . " He snapped his lingers . " We can turn our backs on her now and attend to Poland . But Russia , " he added , " that is a different matter . We must watch our step there . Only leave it to Hitler . He will arrange it all . You will see . " That conversation took place exactly seven years ago . It was shortly after this that we began to notice a change in the American colony . As I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to the national life better than Americans . Perhaps that bears explaining a little . In the first place , Mexico is always conscious of the big country to the north of her . which , in the past , has helped itself to more than half of the Mexican territory and often wielded the big stick . Many Americans go to Mexico with the " I am better and bigger than you are " attitude . American women find it hard to adjust themselves to a country where the man 's word is the law , whore household equipment is not manufactured for the express purpose of making woman 's life easy and independent . A Mexican once said to me , with a wry smile , " You forget , senora , that Mexico is still under the patriarchal system . We prefer our women to remain in the background , and oven though they often get their way in the end , we like to feel that the man 's ( Continued on Pogo 71 ) ( Continued ftorn Page 69 ) word is the final authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " American men I admire . Their efficiency , their ability to go forward on their own , their impatience  --  that is all right , But the women ! " His next remark was made with such Latin grace that it was easier to swallow : " Why , every American woman I have ever seen makes a trapeadar of her husband . " Now , a trapeador is a sleazy gray cloth tied to the end of a mop , and used by the servants every morning to polish the tile floors . I was shocked , to say the least , and rushed eagerly to the defense of American women . But I saw what he meant . Don Otto , at the hacienda , said the same thing to me once . He was telling me about some Americans who were coming down to a mine in Mexico . " The woman complained all the time , " he said . " She did not like the food , the way the work was done , the bathtubs , the train service , the three-day trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it all the time . A German woman , " he added shyly , " would not like it either . But she is used to drudgery and hard work . So she would get busy . But she would n't talk about it . " Americans have never had to apply themselves to the study of foreign languages or foreign people . They have developed their owri set of customs , quite apart from Europe , and , for the most part , they are too independent and outspoken to worry much over their own prejudices and intolerances , or to accept ways differing from their own . On the other hand , where individual Americans have applied themselves to understanding Mexicans and treating them with decent respect , very real social friendships have sprung up . We noticed this when the Mexican Government took over the Southern Pacific . Railroad Company of Mexico and substituted their own nationals for many of the former American officials . The Americans who did remain were mostly people who knew how to get along with the Mexicans , who accepted the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests rather than superior officials . No greater change over happened to us , in the general feeling of the people , than when an American consul came to its who was courteous and careful in his relationships with the Mexicans . His wife , a very lovable sort of person , was an ambassador in herself . Maintaining the dignity of her husband 's position , she did all she could to better rel a tionsh p between Mexicans and Americans . Hell and Farewell The whole question of Americans in Mexico is a subject in itself , and we would do well to study it . The day the three Germans were killed in Czechoslovakia , a little more than a year ago , was the day the war really began for Germans in Mexico . It happened that we were coming back to the States to live , and had gone around to make our farewell calls , One German woman could contain herself no longer . " With you , it is different , " she said . " You can afford to be kind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was our good-by . We spent our last evening in Mexico with two very dear German friends . The wife is not German at all , but . a New York girl of Dutch heritage . With a poise and self-control I have often envied , she has managed to keep her position in the German colony without sacrificing her American friendships . That night , because we were se soon to leave the country , we could all afford to be honest and frank . It . was then that she reminded me that many of Hitler 's ideas had originated in Gretchen 's vegetarian sect , and I began to understand a little better his dramatic power . Losers ' Psychology " The whole problem , " said my friend quietly , " is a spiritual one . There arc bruised feelings among the Germans : an inability " ? she hesitated ? " an in-ability to forget the humiliations of defeat . Now , an American " ? her hus-band was swing at her ? " an merican will take a defeat and squeeze some-thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But . a German never forgets . It is hard for him to be a loser . " My friend 's husband shook his head . " I do n't agree . You still do n't understand . I grant you we have treated the Jews badly , That . was a. mistake . But do not worry . There will be no war . " Then he turned earnestly toward us . " Do one thing for me , When you return to the United States , get a copy of Mein Kampf and read it . Even in English , it shows what I am trying to say . Hitler is a great man , a true idealist . " So we left our German friends in Mexico . Since then , only a few of them have returned to Germany . After the oil controversy with the United States , Mexico began to sell quantities of oil to Germany . German goods  --  and Japanese  --  flooded the country . Now , with the English and French blockade growing steadily stronger , trade is practically at a standstill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America there are families with English , German or Italian names , whose language is Spanish , and whose culture is entirely that of the country in which they live . It is so with some of the older established German families in Mexico . They have brought valuable contributions to the national life , and they have come to Mexico to stay . In our city alone there are certain families in the upper social strata who exert great influence . Their names are German . Their children are often educated abroad , When this is accomplished , however , they return with sigh of relief to Mexico , for it is home . In the end , who knows ? When Hitler and Nazism are things of the past , the Germans still remaining in Mexico may find themselves identified with their new Fatherland whose culture will have absorbed them all .
