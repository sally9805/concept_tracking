For 14 months American businessmen had operated in China in a kind of legal vacuum , created by the U.S. 's renunciation of extraterritoriality in 1943 . This week they were back on firmer ground , although the " Treaty of Friendship , Commerce and Navigation " between the U.S. and China , signed recently at Nanking , did not restore the old license for freebooting exploitation . <P> Modeled in some ways on the prewar reciprocal trade pacts , the treaty provided for free &; equal trade on a most-favored-nation basis . It contained some specific safeguards for American investment , but not at the expense of the Chinese nation or people . Besides furnishing a much-needed business blueprint , the conclusion of the pact was a peacetime implementation of a primary U.S. war thesis : that China is a big power now , and deserves to be treated as such . U.S. business naturally hoped that China would soon begin to behave like a grownup.
