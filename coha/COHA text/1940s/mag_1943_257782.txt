Harriet ( by Florence Ryerson &; Colin Clements ; produced by Gilbert Miller ) brings history and Helen Hayes ( Caesar and Cleopatra , Mary of Scotland , Victoria Regina ) together again . The story of Harriet Beecher Stowe ( 1811-96 ) , from her marriage at 25 till the middle of the Civil War , Harriet is anything but a militant play , is only by fits &; starts a serious one . It is more concerned with crinolines than crusaders . Perhaps it had to be . For while Harriet Beecher Stowe was lifted to the heights with Uncle Tom 's Cabin , during most of her life she was bogged down in family affairs . <P> But the play does not even do justice to her extraordinary obsessing family . There was her father , old Lyman Beecher , bellowing salvation from his pulpit . There was her brother Henry Ward , heaving fashionable bricks from his . There were six other preacher brothers , a whalebone-and-woman 's rights sister Catherine , an empty-pursed absent-minded professor of a husband , a batch of noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got written with the house all Topsy-turvy . In the midst of Harriet 's fame , cooks fired up and gave notice , a son got wounded in the war his mother helped create , twin daughters set their hearts on the same young man and a third daughter won him . <P> The lighter side of Harriet is sometimes lifelike , sometimes merely Life With Fatherlike . Its serious moments-the capture of a fugitive slave in the Stowe parlor ; Harriet delivering a big , meant-to-be-timely speech-are poorly contrived , patly inserted . But Actress Hayes , acting with her usual skill , aging with her usual art , creates , if not a great and rounded woman , a bustling housewife who is also sore beset .
