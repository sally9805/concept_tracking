The strategic mineral the U. S. needs worst and for which it is most dependent on foreign imports is manganese , a coal-like substance essential for hardening and toughening steel . As the world 's No. 1 steelmaker , the U. S. has imported as much as 911,919 long tons a year ( 1937 ) , all but a pipsqueak percentage from Russia , the African Gold Coast , Cuba , Brazil , India , the Philippines . Like rubber , manganese has to travel a long , war-periled route to Pittsburgh and Chicago . Enemy control of the seas would put the great steel industry , vital for national defense , in a pretty fix . <P> High-grade manganese is all abroad , but the greatest supply of low-grade manganese in the world is near Butte , Mont . In World War I , U. S. producers went to work on their submarginal deposits , by 1918 were turning out 35% of U. S. needs . After the Armistice the cheaper product of foreign mines drove down U. S. production to the vanishing point . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go to market again . Awarded to Anaconda by the new Government-owned Metal Reserve Co. was a contract for 240,000 tons of manganese , to be delivered at the rate of 80,000 tons a year . Most heartening news of all was Anaconda 's announcement that it had a selective-flotation process for working the ore , that its concentrate would be as high-grade as any bought abroad . Anaconda will put $1,500,000 into a new plant , will be able to produce 100,000 tons a year , take at least one-eighth of their manganese worries off the shoulders of U. S. steelmen.
