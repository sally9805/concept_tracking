It is a country in which the state ... belongs to the Communist Party bosses , who can do just what they please ... A people 's democracy is a country where the standard of living of the people must be kept below the standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to all other men , obviously no one else must be allowed to live better than the Soviet man . . .
