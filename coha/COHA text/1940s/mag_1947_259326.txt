One bull-necked veteran in a heavy black overcoat leaped forward and tried to wrest the rifle from the nearest cop . Another gendarme smashed his rifle butt into the attacker 's face . Thousands of throats roared defiance of the police and the Government . Belgium , the European belligerent to recover most rapidly after the war , last week was having a bonus-hungry veterans ' riot . <P> Crackling machine guns , mounted-police charges and streams of icy water from fire hoses failed to halt the mob . Forty were injured . <P> TIME Correspondent Fred Klein literally felt the veterans ' mood : " A crowd of veterans milled around my taxi , swung it around and deposited the front wheels on the sidewalk . Their leader pulled me out and seated me gently on the pavement . " <P> Strong Words . The outburst surprised old ( 75 ) Socialist Premier Camille Huysmans . To deputies trapped with him inside Parliament during the riot he said : " We have already spent 7 billion francs on them . They have no right to complain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups rioted in November 1944 worried Belgian leaders . It symbolized the general malaise creeping over the country , after two years of relative prosperity and political unity . <P> The Government had done a good job since Liberation . The shops were full of goods , 1946 American cars rolled through the streets , multicolored neon lights made Brussels one of Europe 's few gay capitals . By permitting a rich flow of imports , cutting prices 10% , keeping wages down and boosting taxes , the Government had licked inflation . But trade was stagnating . Wailed Catholic Opposition Leader Frans van Cauwelaert : " We have wasted our chances , we have squandered our resources . For too long now we have gobbled down the compliments of visiting foreigners , telling us how well off we are compared to other European nations . " <P> The Cassandras could cite unpleasant facts . Coal production was 80% of the prewar level , iron &; steel barely 87% of 1938 and only 65% of 1929 . Exports last year totaled only 29,635,000,000 francs , while imports reached a whopping 52,690,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy had hit an alltime high , glass production again was normal . Belgium 's rich Congo Colony piled up lush foreign exchange by exporting annually up to 5 billion francs ' worth of copper , palm oil , diamonds and secret quantities of uranium ore ( of which Belgians believe the Congo contains half the world 's known supply ) . <P> Strong Medicine . In Brussels retail stores , uranium buttered no parsnips . Told that shopkeepers were complaining bitterly that they can not sell their stocks and that many feared bankruptcy , the Banque Nationale 's suave Governor Maurice Frere had a startling answer : <P> " I am glad to hear that . It confirms to me that we are on the right track . We are restricting our credit policy because we do n't want inflation . Our shopkeepers have made huge profits in the last two years . They laid in stocks , believing that prices would continue rising . Now they are caught in their own greed . Some shopkeepers may go bust ; I can not help it . But when a depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be strong medicine , but they are healthy . "
