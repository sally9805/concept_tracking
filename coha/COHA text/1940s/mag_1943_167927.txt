That the surface of the earth itself may be subject to tides like those of the ocean has long seemed probable , * but there has been no tidal gauge to measure these heavings accurately . At the University of Texas last fortnight a gravitimeter was announced which indicates a daily tidal movement of the solid earth at Austin amounting to two or three inches-larger than ever suspected . <P> The instrument , a refinement of the commercial gravitimeter used in locating oilfields , is a strong spring with a weight attached to its lower end . Any change in the pull of gravity changes the pull of the weight , shortens or lengthens the spring by an invisible amount . The instrument records fluctuations in gravity of one part in a billion . <P> At the University of Texas , Professor A. E. Lockenvitz is recording the local earth fluctuations . With gravitimeters installed at various points , he hopes to be able to predict earthquakes by noting prior increases in earth tides . <P> &lt;FOOTNOTES&gt; * The gravitational pull of the earth and the counterpull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would logically also affect dry land . &lt;/FOOTNOTES&gt;
