Last week all undergraduates at England 's Cambridge University got a stiff , stern letter from Vice Chancellor Charles E. Raven . It concerned their behavior on Guy Fawkes Day , on the 342nd anniversary of Fawkes 's unsuccessful attempt to blow up the House of Lords . <P> It had begun as an ordinary " rag " ( prank ) - the sort that Cambridge students have been playing for centuries . Before the night was through , reported the Vice Chancellor , " undergraduates , in disorderly mobs , often several hundred strong , surged about the streets intent upon doing damage ... In Petty Cury they overturned and seriously damaged a car , regardless of the presence of a woman inside . . . On King 's Parade , they damaged another car , crumpling its bonnet . . . <P> " In the center of the town , they overturned a small commercial van and caused damage of serious consequence to the business of its owner-driver , who was in it at the time . They also uprooted a traffic beacon and thrust it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane , a car was seized and attempts were made to overturn it . The occupants , an old lady and gentleman , were severely shaken and the lady collapsed ... <P> " Missiles were thrown through windows at Newnham College for women ... at buses and at street lamps . In Senate-House yard , a heavy explosive charge was detonated , and some 70 panes of old crown glass were smashed . . . " <P> Some of the older undergraduates , the letter admitted , had tried to stop the mob . One older boy , " indeed , performed an act of considerable courage when a smoke candle was thought to be endangering a child 's life . Except for this , " the Vice Chancellor concluded , " nothing can be said in extenuation of what must pass into University history as a shameful episode . "
