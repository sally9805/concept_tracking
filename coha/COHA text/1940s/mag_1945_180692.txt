( See Cover ) <P> The audience was pure Tory : pink jowls , white heads , handlebar mustaches , Paisley shawls , monocles and lorgnettes , old school ties and wing collars , repeated references to " the Empah . " To this gathering of the Conservative Party ( see above ) , Britain 's master of dialectics presented the shrewdest plank in his platform for the postwar election . With Labor fully and the Liberals partly committed to retention of wartime controls to carry out national planning in peacetime , Winston Churchill came out flatly : <P> " Control for control 's sake is senseless . Controls under the pretext of war or its aftermath which are , in fact , designed to favor accomplishment of totalitarian systems . . . are fraud which should be mercilessly exposed to the British public . At the head of our mainmast we fly the flag of free enterprise . " <P> Having damned controls in principle , he came out for them in practice : <P> " This does not mean that we are likely to run short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I declared that we must have a four-year plan for a new Parliament after the war . . . . Immense toil and preparation have been given to the design of this plan . We are making steady progress . " <P> Thus , in effect , Winston Churchill offered his Party and his country his Minister of Reconstruction Lord Woolton , a man who is not a member of that Party or even a politician , but a British businessman in Government . <P> Blueprints . The plain fact is that no British Government can hope to pilot Britain through peace without a substantial degree of state control over the lives and livings of Britons . The things that Politician Churchill and Businessman Woolton propose would have been damned two decades ago by every Tory in England as shameless Bolshevism . The plans include : social insurance " from womb to tomb " ; the " greatest Education Act ever known in these Islands " ; sweeping extensions of workmen 's compensation awards ; reforms in the national health system ; vast housing projects . And with them , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy , how labor will work , what materials industry can have and what goods it can sell . <P> The change that has brought general British acceptance of these ideas is not merely psychological . It is largely physical . The housing projects are required because of the vast war damage to British buildings . In the present state of the British economy , postwar control of food and materials is practically unavoidable . <P> With most of her earning assets abroad liquidated , with huge new foreign debts created by the purchase of war materials , Britain not only has to recover her prewar trade but multiply it-twice or even threefold . But Britain 's capacity to export will be limited by her capacity to buy , by her capacity to replace obsolete , damaged and worn-out equipment , and by her capacity to produce-which is not merely a matter of machinery but of a healthy , happy , intelligent , secure population . <P> And Britain 's moral strength-her national will to pull in her belt and recover a place in the economic sun-has never been higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in British business .
