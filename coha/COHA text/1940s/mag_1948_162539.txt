( Wits in London call Western Union " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe is politically , militarily and economically organized . I do not criticize ; I observe a state of affairs . . . . But then I say , you Communists have accomplished this organization , this union . Naturally , you will see no good reason why we should not do the same thing ourselves . . . . The policy which the Russians uphold and approve in Eastern Europe can not , naturally , be simultaneously a matter for worry when practiced in Western Europe . . . . <P> " It seems to me absolutely impossible , " he added , " to conceive today of a defense of Belgium limited to the frontiers of Belgium .

Others , in their search for recovery , do not hesitate to fling themselves into purely monetary manipulations France .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
