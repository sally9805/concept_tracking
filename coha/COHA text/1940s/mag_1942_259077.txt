Swart , pig-eyed Pierre Laval could have things his own way now in France . With dictatorial powers granted to him by old Marshal Ptain , with the Gestapo by his side in a country now fully under German occupation , he , free of the check-reins of government , felt he could thumb his bulbous nose at public opinion . These were main items on the well-filled Laval calendar : <P> &gt; A meeting with Adolf Hitler and other Axis leaders to lay plans fora new arrangement to replace the defunct armistice . <P> &gt; Application of the Nazis ' anti-Semitic laws throughout France in the near future. * <P> &gt; Discussions in Paris with Jacques Doriot and Marcel Dat , Fascist editors and leaders , for the creation of a single French political party . Said Dat last week : " France must . . . cooperate in Hitler 's so-called New Order . The alternative is a collective death certificate . " <P> At a press conference in Vichy before he set out for Paris , Quisling Laval presented himself to the press as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . . . with a parliamentary halo . " Said he : " I want Germany to win . . . Germany 's victory will prevent our civilization from foundering in chaos . . . . An American victory would bring in its train the triumph of Jews and Communists . " <P> Best indication of what many Frenchmen thought of the Laval regime was the circulation of a report that coloness , amiable Albert Lebrun , last President of the Third Republic , had fled to Switzerland . <P> * Reports were that Jews would be required to wear the Star of David , as in Germany , would be deprived of civil rights , deprived of citizenship if naturalized since August 1927 , thrown out of government jobs . Divorces between Jews and " Aryans " would be facilitated . Some 1,500,000 Jews will be affected .
