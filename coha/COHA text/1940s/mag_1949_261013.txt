Except for Fanny Brice , as Baby Snooks , no woman comic has ever seriously challenged radio 's top funnymen . Most radio comediennes ( Mary Livingstone , Portland Hoffa , Jane Ace , Gracie Allen ) stick to mixed-doubles family comedy . <P> Last week , NBC ( which had lost almost all of its comedy line-up to raiding CBS ) launched a female counterattack with The Ethel Merman Show ( Sun . 9:30 p.m. , E.D.T. ) . The program 's tenuous story line has dark , bouncy , 41-year-old Ethel Merman , ably assisted by ex-Juvenile Star Leon Janney , trying to sell a new revue to a somnolent backer-Homer Tubbs , the Syracuse floor-mop king . <P> Dead Cherokee . Essentially , the show is a platform for the display of Merman 's singing voice , which ranges from a 100-proof whisper to a strident bellow , her theater-born gift of timing , and her immaculately correct intonation for every funny line . With this bristling arsenal , Ethel puts starch into the feeblest jokes ; her rowdy , slam-bang personality is nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashes a Annie Get Your Gun , Something for the Boys and Du Barry Was a Lady . <P> In her opening show she managed to inject a few bars of her favorite song . I Got Rhythm , and gave the full Merman treatment to three others . She portrayed a fight announcer ( " Tiger is fighting back ! He throws a left - a right - another left . Now he 's bringing a right uppercut from the floor - now they 're bringing Tiger up from the floor . " ) . She played every character in a " Pageant of American Womanhood " that included Queen Victoria , Florence Nightingale and a hilarious Joan of Arc , as well as such authentic native daughters as Barbara Frietchie , Ruby Foo and Miriam , the mother of Irium . As Pocahontas ( " better-known by her Indian name , Alka-Seltzer " ) , Ethel Merman tomahawked a marauding redskin who was stalking Captain John Smith . " Like George Washington , I can not tell-um lie , " she cried triumphantly . " I chop down Cherokee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second try at radio . Back in 1935 , she went on the air with a program broadcast at the same time as Major Bowes ' Amateur Hour and went off , defeated , twelve weeks later . She is leery of television : " I did two shows with Milton Berle . On both of them he had horses in the act - and everything that goes with horses . We were so cramped backstage that I had only a screen for costume changes and an electrician practically held a light over me while I changed . " She added reflectively : " There must be an easier way to make a living . " <P> Since Ethel Merman has earned more than $1,000,000 in ten Broadway musicals ( Lindsay &; Grouse are at work on an idea for a new one ) , making a living is presumably not a major worry . One of her friends , puzzled by her offstage venture , asked , " What do you expect to get out of your radio show ? " Merman answered shortly : " A sponsor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
