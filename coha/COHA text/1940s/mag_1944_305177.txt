In Washington , one nightclub operator gloomed : " This is the beginning of the end for some nightclubs - for me it 's al ready the end . " Then he closed up . The new 30% tax was too much for him . In San Francisco , 31 nightspots closed , or got out from under the tax by firing floor shows and dance bands . In Philadelphia , 16 clubs did the same . Another 86 followed suit in Manhattan . In Cleveland , 15 locked their doors . <P> Although swank establishments like Manhattan 's Stork Club were self-consciously unaffected , the real or fancied complaints of what the month-old tax was doing to the nation 's cabarets last week swelled louder than a chorus of hot brasses . The American Guild of Variety Artists estimated that jobless entertainers would soon number 15,000 . No one expected Washington to lose much sleep over this ; the War Manpower Commission has been trying for months to force such nonessential workers into war plants . <P> But there was real cause for official worry if nightclub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported a 60% drop . Contemplating this , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Walter F.George predicted that the new tax , which Congress had hoped would bring in $90,000,000 , will actually bring in less than the old 5% tax . He advocated that the tax be reduced to 15 or 20% . Minnesota 's Harold Knutson had already tossed in the House hopper a resolution to lower the tax to 10% .
