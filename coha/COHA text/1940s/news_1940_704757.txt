txt Elsewhere on this page we publish a letter from the administrator of the division of public contracts in the Department of Labor , taking exception to certain factual statements made in an editorial in THE TIMES of May 1 regarding the manner in which minimum wages have been determined by the department under the Walsh-Healey act . Substantially the same statements ' were made in an editorial in our issue of Dec. 23 , 1938 , without leading to similar objections at that time . The statements were based on an analysis published by the National Industrial Conference Board and dated Nov. 21 , 1938 . That analysis declared : ? * * nor does the Department consider it at all contradictory that the " prevailing minimum " should also be the same as the prevailing wage in the industry small-arms ammunition industry or even above that wage men 's welt shoe industry . *. * * In general , the procedure adopted by the Department in its wage determination is to select the most prevalent wage in the lower income brackets ( which is also often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midpoint of that wage class as the desired prevailing minimum wage . There appears some tendency to define the " lower income brackets " as those which include the lowest 25 per cent ( or more ) of all wage-earners . It is difficult to find any logical reason why the lowest 25 per cent , rather than the lowest 10 per cent or 50 per cent , should have been arbitrarily chosen . It may be that the Conference Board was mistaken in thinking it found some of the facts or tendencies it cited . It may be also that the rulings of the Department of Labor have become more rational in some of these respects since the analysis was published . The basic defect , after all , resides not in errors or inflexibility of administration , but in the existence and wording of the Walsh-Healey act itself . There is ambiguity in the requirement that employers who bid on Government contracts must pay not less than " prevailing minimum wages . " The ' law necessarily leads to elaborate investigations of books , to hearings , rulings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fixing wages that the administrator describes , the actual minimum wages paid in an industry must necessarily be raised above what they were before , no matter how high the previous minimum may have been . When one takes , for example , " a weighted arithmetical average " of wages " at the lower end of the wage scale , " it is necessarily higher than the actual minimum . Even after this figure has been fixed , a repetition of this process would raise the new figure still higher , and this process could theoretically go on ad infinitum . When this ' artificial minimum has been fixed , moreover , there is pressure to maintain the differentials that previously existed between various types of work , with a tendency to produce a general increase in the entire wage level of a firm . As it is not always practicable to segregate the work being done under Government contract from regular commercial work done in the same factory , these consequences must certainly discourage many firms from bidding on Government contracts or taking those " educational orders " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense production is further constricted by the requirement in. the act of a maximum forty-hour week , which can not even be exceeded by overtime rates except with the express permission of the Secretary of Labor . This becomes particularly serious when a shortage of skilled labor exists , as it already does , for specialized defense work . Under the Walsh-Healey act the Department of Labor has fixed minimum wages for steel workers 108 per cent higher than the minimum now fixed by the general Wage-Hour Act . The administrator apparently finds nothing discriminatory or anomalous in this . On the contrary , in demanding a superspecial " protection " for labor in the steel industry because " practically no one receives as little as 40 cents an hour " there , he implies that we must have , not a general basic minimum wage for industry , but a different legal minimum wage for each particular industry , on the theory that wherever natural economic forces or employerworker agreements have placed wage rates , the Government should force them at least just a little bit higher . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The WalshHealey act should be repealed .
