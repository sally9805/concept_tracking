It looked as if the Roman Catholic Church in Czechoslovakia had finally given way to relentless Communist pressure . " Priests and Catholic laymen , " said a government spokesman last week , " are now obligated to faithful and effective collaboration ... in the building of socialism . " <P> The Czech puppet Parliament last month passed a church law , by the usual unanimous show of hands , which made all clergymen employees of the state , and set up President Klement Gottwald 's Communist son-in-law , Alexej Cepicka , as cabinet minister in charge of religion . The Catholic Church had consistently fought against the law ; one manifesto , signed by 80% of the country 's 7,000 priests , declared it " absolutely unacceptable . " A memorandum sent to the government by the Council of Bishops a week after the passage of the law charged that it violated the Czech Republic 's constitution ( which guarantees freedom of religion and the church 's right to administer its own internal affairs ) , and thus placed the church " outside the legal pale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , authorized priests to accept state salaries , to swear loyalty to the Communist " people 's democracy " and to pledge themselves not to do anything " against the state 's interests , security or integrity . " But later the bishops instructed the priests to take the oath with the qualification , " . . . Since I am convinced that the government would never ask anything which would be contrary to the laws of God or human rights . " <P> The Reds slyly used the Episcopate 's concession to discredit the church . President Gottwald freed 127 priests ( jailed as hostages for their opposition to the government 's new church laws ) , because they had " promised to mend their ways . " A state court judge told the released priests : " I beg you to consider the significance and implied pledge of this magnanimous act . " <P> The Catholic Church in Czechoslovakia was faced with a painful choice between two evils : to continue in full defiance and risk wholesale persecution , or try to salvage as much as it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the state and playing for time . Hungary 's Cardinal Mindszenty had chosen the uncompromising course ; despite his stand , the church in Hungary was forced to submit to state control . In a directive to priests which explains their reasons for choosing the course of compromise , the Czech Council of Bishops wrote : " It is necessary to ... save you for the spiritual care of the faithful .
