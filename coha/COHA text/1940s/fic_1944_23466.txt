Private Max Steele , of Greenville , South Carolina , describes " Grandfather and Chow Dog " as his " first story published in a national magazine . " GRANDFATHER AND CHOW DOG A Story MAX STEELE W E. BELIEVE that Grandmother is going crazy . Easter Sunday Mother caught her leaving for church with a water pistol and a bottle of ink in her pocketbook . When Mother took them away from her she grew furious and said , " Arid I suppose you want this too . " She took a hard-boiled Easter egg from the top of her corset , placed it on the mantelpiece , and took off her hat . " I just wo n't go to church . " No one could persuade her to go then : " It 's the first Easter I 've missed in twenty years , " she said , " but I 'll stay here if everything I do is going to cause such a commotion . " She sat down , opened her Bible , and began looking at the Varga girls that she uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters from a mysterious person whom she called Captain Bligh , but after they were exhibited in an alimony trial by a friend of hers she would n't touch them again . ) Mother believes Grandmother 's recent behavior goes back to the time she was caught ' hoarding formaldehyde in her mortuary , because ever since then she has had it in her head that people are gossiping about her , making up lies , and in short , planning her ruin . " Jealousy , pure jealousy , " she says . " They 're just mad because I make money when others go in the hole . " Last week she decided that someone had started a vile rumor that she had sold Grandpa 's body to a black market , and she was very upset . To squelch the rumor she wrote a poem and paid fifty cents a line to have it printed in the classified section of the evening paper : They drafted Grandpa just last week : He was buried down on his farm . But they dug him up , and felt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm ! " Apparently she believed the poem , for when Dad asked her about it she chuckled good-naturedly and said , " Are n't they going to be surprised when they find out what a rotten soldier he is ? The old fool would join the Army . And at his age ! " We tried to explain to her what had happened to Grandpa , but she would n't listen . " Sly creatures ! " she said to us . " Think you can trick me out of my allot-ments ? " She would not believe that the chow dog was dead either . " Those two will never die , " she laughed . And somehow I think she was right , for there was a great pathos in their friendship . A TRAVELING snuff salesman had left town suddenly in the middle of the night leaving a Chow dog in his hotel room , supposedly as payment for a week 's lodging . However , the way it turned out , the hotel would have been better off if he had taken the dog and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came down to the lobby and established his kingdom . He would watch the hand above the elevator door and the minute it would point to " One , " he would hurl himself at the door , timing his leap so that he would land right in the stomach of the nearest passenger . Then he would proceed to bite hell out of everyone . By mid-afternoon regular residents of the hotel were carrying suitcases and clothes racks down the fire escape , and no new customers were coming in . A little crowd had gathered outside the hotel to listen to the occasional screams and shouts of the waitresses and bus boys who were trapped in the building . The manager had hesitated to call the police because the publicity would be bad , he felt , and the lobby had just been redecorated . Grandpa 's office was right across the street from the hotel , and the sight of even two people on Main Street at the same time was enough to get him out . He was a buyer for a textile company , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of someone else handling it would make his flesh crawl , and so he always wore gloves and stayed out of the office as much as possible . So over to the hotel he went . " What 's the matter ? " he asked . " Plumbing stopped up ? " The manager explained to him that there was a very mad chow dog inside killing off all his hired help . " I can master any animal , " Grandpa said . ( He believed this too , for he had been thinking of practically nothing else since Clyde Beatty had been to Greenville that fail . I remember he used to make Dad and me run at him , and then he would back us off into a corner with a kitchen chair . Dad never much entered into the spirit of the act , but I thought that it was great fun . ) " I can master any animal , " Grandpa said again , looking about him at the crowd . " But , Grandpa , " the manager said , " you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look at me , " Grandpa said , opening his pale blue eyes until they looked as though they were going to roll off his high cheekbones . The manager began looking . Grandpa began muttering low and walking toward him . The manager moved backwards . Grandpa bent forward as though he were going to spring . The manager began to laugh nervously . The crowd followed at each side . Grandpa bent way over and so did the manager . Without taking his eyes from the returning stare , Grandpa dropped to his knees . Trancelike the manager dropped to his and continued moving backward . They crawled half a city block and then Grandpa shouted , " Down ! " The manager fell prone . The crowd cheered and everyone agreed that it would be aII right for Grandpa to go into the hotel . The manager stood up sweating . He wiped the sweat from his forehead and held the door open for Grandpa . N o oNE knows what happened inside except that the dog was called nineteen different kinds of a son-of-a-bitch . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The next that was heard from Grandpa was his voice over the telephone to Grandmother at the mortuary . " Send over one of your screaming-buggies , " he panted . He must have been very tired , for he hated ambulances above all things . He used to stand out in front of the house and holler at Grandmother as she would get out of one , " I 'll have the law on you yet , risking your neck , speeding through traffic in those howling hellwagons just to get home before the biscuits get cold . " When the ambulance arrived , the group on the sidewalk parted , and Grandpa came out leading a pitiful-looking beast by a lamp cord . A gold brocade pillow was stuffed in its mouth and the tassel dangled at the dewlap . " What is that ? " Grandmother asked , ignoring her husband 's bare thigh . " A dog , " he said . " Whose dog ? " she asked . " My dog , " he said . " What 's her name ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Grandpa was interested in it . " It 's not a her , " he said . " How do you know ? " " I , woman , " Grandfather said proudly , " know everything there is to know about this animal . " " What 's his name , then ? " ( Grandmother always knew how to ask trick questions . ) Grandfather studied the animal for a minute , leaning his head to one side . " Chow Dog , " he answered . From then on " Chow Dog " became a magic word to Grandpa . He and the dog were inseparable . The dog would go to the office with him , and Grandpa taught him to bite people who said " cotton , " They seemed to enjoy and hate the same things . One day while he was shaving at his office for a very important appointment with a man who had grown a purple-tinted cotton , Grandpa playfully put a handful of lather on the dog 's nose and all about his mouth . Chow Dog did n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the bathroom door . The important fellow with the secret purple-tinted cotton arrived on time , just a few minutes later . Grandpa listened with all politeness possible . He even seemed excited over the new development , as he walked up and down behind his desk . But just when the fellow unwrapped the purple lint , Grandpa opened the door and said , " Cotton . " Chow Dog rushed out with the foam flying . " A mad dog ! " screamed Grandfather , climbing up on the desk . The purple-tinted-cotton man dashed for the door , screaming , " My cotton ! My cotton ! Do n't let anything happen to my cotton ! " Chow Dog was so mad he forgot how to run . He just sat there and howled . Grandpa thought that the idea was so funny that about twice a week he would lather himself up , and then lather the dog , and then they would dash down the stairs shouting and barking and into the street , where the traffic would stop . Then Grandpa would dash into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would laugh so much that the soda-jerk would have to hold him up.rrnE joke had been going on for about two months when one day Grandpa heard a shot while he was in the drug store wiping the lather off his face . He heard Chow Dog bark and then another shot . When he got outside he saw a state trooper standing in the door of his car , the motor still running . Chow Dog was limping into an alley out of range of the fire . That night Dad and I stayed at the hospital with the dog . Grandpa would n't come in but stayed outside underneath the window . Toward morning Chow Dog developed pneumonia . No one told Grandpa , but he must have sensed it . He cursed a blue streak . After about two hours the effect of the cursing began to tell on the doctor , who was putting up a losing battle for the dog 's life . " Listen to him out there baying at the moon , " the doctor whispered hysterically . " He 's not baying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity , fearing that a slur had been cast against the family . " He 's cussing . He 's cussing the state trooper . He 's cussing pistols and people who do n't know how to have fun . " Grandpa kept on cursing , but at eleven that morning Chow Dog died anyway . Dad and I wrapped the body in a sheet and slipped it out the front door . We took it to a nice spot about ten miles out from town and buried it . When we got home Grandpa was waiting in the driveway for us . He did n't say a word , though . He just turned around and walked slowly to the back yard , ignoring a black Persian cat that crossed his path . The next morning we found that Grandpa 's bed had not been slept in . We rushed out to the spot where we had buried the body , and sure enough , there was Grandpa . Half the day we tried to reason with him , but he would not listen , and he would not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come talk to him , and Grandmother sent out an old hearse for him to sleep in . The veterinarian sat on the running board of the hearse , Grandpa remained on the grave , and Dad and I sat under a pine on the other side . It was a lonely sight , the four of us and the hearse , and the dark pines with the sun setting back of them . Grandpa was telling the doctor what a grand mess the hotel lobby had been ; he was saying , " You ca n't love anybody unless you 've fought well with him or against him . It do n't make any difference which . " Then no one said anything for a long time . Finally the doctor said , " It was an easy and a natural death . He just quit breathing . You should see some of the deaths we have . Sometimes we have to give a dog ground glass intravenously . . . Grandfather appeared to hear for the first time the words that were being spo-MAGAZINE ken to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any with you ? " " Dogs ? " the doctor asked . " Ground glasq , " Grandpa said . The doctor shivered all over and stood up . " I 'm afraid , Mr. Steele , we 'll have to use force . " I sat on Grandpa 's stomach , and he sneezed all the way back to town . " It 's just a cold , " Grandmother said . " He 'll never die . Just like old George Baker . I 've been waiting on that funeral for years . " But two days later  --  three days after the death of Chow Dog  --  Grandpa died . ? Plowman 's Folly Refuted , 1844 M i neighbors were extremely kind with their suggestions . They had never seen such deep ploughing , and warned me not to turn up the old subsoil , and thus bring it to the surface . But they were not book-farmers . Now , this business of deep subsoil ploughing is a matter of indispensable value in all agriculture , but especially so in the planting of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the earth is thoroughly and deeply loosened for the free expansion of the roots . If I could have ploughed two feet deep , it would have been all the better . In fact , the art of ploughing is in its mere infancy in this country . Too many of us follow blindly in the beaten track . The first plough was a tough , forked stick , of which one prong served as a beam , while the other dug the earth as a coulter . Of course the ploughing was only scratching . It would have been preposterous to expect the ploughman of Hesiod 's or of Virgil 's time to turn up and mellow the soil to a depth of fifteen or sixteen inches . Down to the present age , ploughing was inevitably a shallow affair . But iron ploughs , steel ploughs , subsoil ploughs , have changed all this . It is as easy today to mellow the earth to the depth of two feet , as it was a century ago to turn over a sward to the depth of six inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from the moist , milder one of England , Ireland , or even Holland , whence our ancestors emigrated , absolutely requires of us deep ploughing . Drought is our perpetual danger . Most crops arc twenty to sixty per cent short of what they would have been with adequate and seasonable moisture . That moisture exists not only in the skies above , but in the earth beneath our plants . Though the skies may capriciously withhold it , the earth never will , if we provide a rich , mellow subsoil through which the roots can descend for moisture . t From Ten Acres Enough by Edmund Morris , one of the great American best sellers , first published in 1844 and thereafter a standard bookstore item for two generations . Translated into seueral languages , the book was circulated around the world .
