 | WE ARE about to have a collective coming of age ! The women in the United States have been participants in government for nearly twenty years . I think it behooves us to look back on this period in which we have been serving our apprenticeship and decide what our accomplishments have been , how much good our education has done us , and whether we really are able to consider ourselves fullfledged citizens . Where did we start and how far have we come ? Twenty years ago , when we were granted the right of suffrage , some people thought that women were going to revolutionize the conduct of government . Yet all we were given was the right to vote . Men had had the vote on a fairly universal basis ever since the country was established ? without achieving Utopia . Everyone knew that corruption still existed , and that the gentlemen did not always devote themselves to their civic duties in the unselfish and ardent manner that might be expected in a democracy . In 1919 , however , this fact did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come about by the granting of suffrage to women . Alas and alas , the reforms just did not happen ! Perhaps it would be as well to mention also that some of the dire results prophesied if women were given the vote have n't come about , either . Let us see what women have actually done in public life thus far . It is fair , I think , to speak first of some of the women who were leaders in the fight for suffrage because of their influence on the thought of the men and women of the period , even though they may not actually have held public office . By studying them , I think we can get a very good idea of the qualities women must bring to public life . Dr. Anna Howard Shaw is dead ; but Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt is still alive , and I have had the privilege of knowing her for many years . Both seem to have certain qualities in common : a deep belief in the justice of a cause ; the power to organize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be both humorous and dramatic . Add good physical health ? not a quality , perhaps , but an essential ? and you have a picture of these two suffrage leaders . Certain other suffrage leaders I know only from hearsay . Inez Milholland , for instance , was probably very able , and she certainly used her personal attractions to drive home her point ! There is no question about it , both charm and good looks are useful weapons , which ladies can always use to good advantage when they have them , no matter what offices they hold . Available facts about women who have actually occupied political office during the past twenty years are incomplete , and it is extremely difficult to get accurate information . We can get figures for certain years and nothing for other years . Fortunately . the League of Women Voters will shortly publish its 1939 compilation on women in public office , which will supplement our information . There are certain trends , however , that even incomplete figures seem to show . In the past ten years fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The peak was reached in 1929 , when thirtyeight states could boast of one hundred and forty-nine women in state legislatures . In 1939 there were only twenty-eight states having women representatives , and the total was only one hundred and twenty-nine women . However , the change is so very slight that I think we may consider it a temporary fluctuation , indicating nothing more than that women have n't yet gained real confidence in themselves in that type of competition . Besides , as we shall see , the number of women in appointive positions is steadily increasing . In the United States Senate . Gladys Pyle , Republican of South Dakota . was elected in November 1938 for an unexpired term , which ended January 3 , 1939 . And three other women Senators were appointed to finish out unexpired terms and then retired . Mrs. Hattie Caraway , Democrat of Arkansas , is the one woman who has really served as a United States Senator . She was first appointed to succeed her husband in 1931 , and then elected in 1932 and reelected in 1938 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ability and is respected by men in political life . At first one heard that she was under this or that influence ; that she was a rubber stamp ; that she did little thinking for herself ; but of late one hears a great deal more about her being a useful member of the Senate and having a mind of her own . There is no doubt that she has grown and that her record can bear comparison with that of any of her colleagues . In the House of Representatives , we have had twenty-one women members . Janet Rankin served before the adoption of the federal suffrage amendment . Her state of Montana had passed a suffrage act of its own . She will always be remembered for her inability to vote for war . One of the dramatic incidents reported in the newspapers of the day was how she burst into tears and refused to cast her vote in favor of war . I was not present , but I have always had a certain sympathy with the gesture even though it was futile . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats . In the short session of the 71st Congress , nine women 's names were carried on the rolls of the House of Representatives . This is the largest number carried at any one time . Since then the number has been steadily decreasing , till today there are only four women members of the House : Mary Norton of New Jersey , Caroline O'Day of New York , Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts , and Jessie Sumner of Illinois . Three of these women I know well ; all are good , hard-working members and on a par with the men who have served with them . I always think of Mary Norton as being primarily interested in welfare work , though she has grown far beyond those first interests . Caroline O'Day has fixed ideas on the subject of war , which nothing could change Anyone who has seen her signature would know that she can wield the artist 's brush , so it is no surprise to find that she was for many years : painter and illustrator , working her ( and in Paris . Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she still looks charmin ; in her old Red Cross uniform . @#  | I remember also Ruth Hanna McCormick Simms , who , as a member of the House of Representatives , did credit to a family that has often served the public . And Mrs. Florence Kahn of California was an able and witty member , who would be welcomed back by the House with open arms . The picture is much the same in state legislatures . We have had only two women state governors , both Democrats ? Mrs. Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming and Mrs. Miriam A. Ferguson of Texas . I met Mrs. Ferguson once and then only for a few minutes ; but it is generally conceded that her job was that of being her husband 's mouthpiece . This is pardonable in private life , but extremely unwise in public life , where every individual should stand on his or her own feet . Mrs. Ross went into politics through the urging of her husband 's friends , notably the present Senator , Joseph O'Mahoney of Wyoming . As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good advisors , knew her own limitations , and was on the whole an average good governor , though not a great one . She was elected for one term only , and that does not permit a man or a woman to accomplish much . We will find on the rolls of both the elective and appointive officials , according to the laws of their respective ? states , a number of women as secretaries of state , state treasurers , state auditors ? which looks as though women are better mathematicians than they are credited with being ! In the appointive positions , the trend shows an upward curve in both state and federal governments . This would seem to prove me correct in my surmise that women are not yet prepared to go out and stand up under the average political campaign . In addition men rarely are inclined to give them nominations for elective positions if there is a chance to elect a man ; so , frequently , a woman is beaten for an elective office before she starts to run . In the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women ; but that idea is gradually wearing away . There is more truth in the statement that men have a different attitude toward politics than women . They play politics a little more like a game . With the men , it becomes a serious occupation for a few weeks before election ; whereas women look upon it as a serious matter year in and year out . It is associated with their patriotism and their duty to their country . There are moments when I think that women 's fervor to work continuously does not make them very popular with the gentlemen ! Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt won my admiration long before I actually met her , while she was making a name for herself in President Hoover 's administration . She helped to attain a model federal prison for women . This institution , headed by Dr. Mary Harris , does great credit to the vision of the women who fought so hard to obtain a new type of prison for women offenders . The head of the Department of Home Economics in the Department of Agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a great many years , just as has Mary Anderson , the head of the Women 's Bureau in the Department of Labor . Both of them have built up able staffs and are considered to be very useful government employes . Katharine Lenroot , for instance , now chief of the Children 's Bureau in the Department of Labor , followed Grace Abbott , with whom she had worked for many years . Both women have done a social-service job ; but at the same time they have had to be good politicians , for their job could be carried on only if the men in Congress were convinced that it was being well done and that the people at home  | were receiving a service which they desired and in which they believed . In 1933 about thirty-five women came into important positions in Washington , and in the last six or seven years there has been an increase in the number of women appointed to more important offices . Strange as it may seem , I think this is due to the work of a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic National Committee in charge of the Women 's Division ? Miss Mary W. Dewson . Miss Dewson was interested in politics because of what she thought women could achieve through political organizations . She began her career in Boston , at the age of twenty-three , as a supervisor of the Girls ' Parole Department of Massachusetts . She made her contact with state legislatures while she worked for the Consumers ' League . She came into partisan political work during a national campaign . When that was over , she stayed on in the National Democratic Committee , and I think virtually all the men , from the President and Postmaster General Farley to most of the other heads of Departments , will concede that there has rarely been a woman more active in getting women into political positions ! She was almost uncomfortably honest , at times somewhat brusque ; but she had a sense of humor and a loyalty and devotion that made many people admire her and grieve when she was transferred from political work to the Social Security Board and when , finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . ANY women in Washington today M hold positions because of ability and preparation that has little or no connection with political work . They have been distinguished along some special line , and frequently they came in long before the present administration . But those who came in during this administration owe a great deal to Molly Dewson , and women as a whole should be grateful for the fact that she never backed a woman whom she did not think capable of holding the job she was trying to get . The record of women in office during the past few years shows that her judgment was , on the whole , good . We have , for instance , the first woman member of a President 's Cabinet ? the Secretary of Labor , Miss Frances Perkins . Most of us find it difficult to recall the names of former Secretaries of Labor . I happen to remember one or two ; but I find , when I ask my friends about them , that the only Secretary of Labor whom they know much about is Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing her praises ; but they do know that she exists ? first , because she had a career before she held her present office ; next , because she has held an extremely difficult position in a most trying period and , on the whole , has acquitted herself well . She has never really learned to handle the press , so her newspaper contacts are bad . This is partly because she is suspicious of reporters , and those around her , trying to protect her , accentuate this suspicion . I can not say that this attitude is never justified ; but with her keen intuition and her wide experience and contact with human nature , she should be able to distinguish between the fine and trustworthy correspondents and those who can not be trusted . Newspaper correspondents are no different from other human beings ? they are good and bad . Years ago Louis Howe told me that no group of people has a higher standard @# of ethics , and I still believe that to be true . This inability to deal with the press is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she has been the best Secretary of Labor this country has had . Mrs. Nellie Tayloe Ross , whom I have already mentioned as a former Governor of Wyoming , was Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1928 and was appointed Director of the Mint in the Treasury Department in 1933 . There is nothing spectacular about her job ; but it requires steady work . I think she has always performed her duties conscientiously . The first woman Assistant Secretary of the Treasury was appointed in 1934 : Miss Josephine Roche of Colorado . She has long been interested in social questions , and she transformed her coal mines in Colorado , when she inherited them from her father , to meet the standards she felt should exist in that industry . She came to Washington a proved executive . She retired of her own volition , feeling that her business required her attention ; but she has retained the position of Chairman of the Committee to study medical service in this country . This Committee is doing an excellent piece of work . IN one other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have had our first woman minister to a foreign country ? Ruth Bryan Rohde , who was appointed our Minister to Denmark in 1933 . She identified herself to such an extent with the interests of the country to which she was accredited that she returned to us married to a Dane . She resigned in 1936 . Mrs. J. Borden Harriman was appointed Minister to Norway in 1937 . From all accounts , she has taken a great interest in the conditions of the people there and has been able to give to our country a very much better understanding of the Norwegian people . Two women held major judicial posts in 1930 . Florence Allen , a judge on the Supreme Court Bench in Ohio , and Genevieve R. Cline , who had been appointed to the United States Customs Court in New York City , which is a life commission . In 1939 Florence Allen was appointed by President Roosevelt to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals , 6th District . Miss Cline remained on the bench in New York . Miss Garrick H. Buck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hawaii . In the Labor Department we find Miss Mary La Dame , special assistant to the Secretary of Labor . Everyone knows the name of Mrs. Lucille Foster McMillin , on the Civil Service Commission . She , like Mrs. Ellen Woodward , formerly head of the women 's and professional projects under the Works Progress Administration , and now on the Social Security Board , would impress you first as a very feminine woman with charm and social distinction ; but both of them know how to be good executives and work hard . They may carry their sympathetic understanding of human problems with them in their working hours , but they also carry level heads and a keen intelligence , which makes them acceptable members of any men 's conference . Mrs. Florence Kerr , who is now in the Works Progress Administration , is proving herself to be a good executive , also . Miss Katherine Blackburn is head of one of the most interesting bureaus in Washington , the Bureau of Press Intelligence , which will get for any member of the government information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress will do this , too , but not quite in the ut to-date , last-minute manner that Katll erine Blackburn has evolved .

MI Jo Coffin comes from the ranks of lain just as does Miss Rose Schneiderman. wi was a valuable member of the Advisee ' Committee of the National Recovery AA ministration while it functioned , and wi today is ins the New York State Depart ment of Labor as Secretary to the Co missioner . Both of them are interes women , capable of firing the imagina of young people , resourceful , tactful , tent , and therefore valuable in their tacts with their superiors and their fell workers . Marian Bannister , the sister of Sen .. Carter Glass of Virginia , reminds me the old French nobility . I am sure could walk to the guillotine with absol dignity and calm ! She signs the P dent 's pay check and all the mail goes out of the office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Employment C. pensation Commission . And Laura Brown and Lucy Howorth are doing g work in the Veterans ' Administration . the first time there is a woman , Ma . J. Harron , on the Board of Tax App In 1939 there were approximately five women in major positions throuo the federal government . The number women in clerical , fiscal , and professi positions has grown to 162,518 . MANY other women I have not . MANY are competently filling in : . tant positions ; but my list is already long . I do not wish to close , however . w out mentioning three women . Mrs. Harriman Rumsey , who headed the ? sumers ' Division in the old NRA day . a thankless job .
