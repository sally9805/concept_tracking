U.S. home construction , on starvation corner for the past three years , became the first industry to get a full-ripe postwar plum . From the War Production Board came the announcement : as of Oct. 15 , order L-41 , limiting construction of new houses to an $8,000 outlay , will be completely withdrawn ( TIME , Sept. 10 ) . Thus builders got the go-ahead for their biggest boom yet , almost entirely free of Government control . <P> No one denied that construction should be signaled off to as fast a start as possible . The estimated minimum U.S. need is 12.5 million new houses in the next ten years-400,000 units for 1946 , 750,000 for 1947 , over a million a year thereafter . But there was one big question : when would it be safe to give the signal ? <P> Almost everyone in Washington thought it was safe last week - except OPAdministrator Chester Bowles . More inflation-conscious now than ever , Bowles argued that abolishing L41 gave contractors the right to build houses on speculation , sell them on the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits only if he built a house for a private individual , this , said Bowles , would make the sky the only price ceiling . <P> War Mobilization and Reconversion Director John W. Snyder took the opposite view , arguing that the only way to fight inflation is by production . Reconversion and re-employment would be greatly expedited by encouraging construction to the limit , since the building industry normally accounts for about 5% of the total U.S. employment . And high production would in turn create so much competition that any contractor who let prices get out of hand would just be cutting his own throat . <P> The OWMR argument is predicated on the theory that by next spring , when the building season starts for most of the U.S. , both men and materials will be available on a scale ample to meet the rush . To make the gamble a good one , it has already had OPA put price increases on cast iron , soil pipe , gypsum lath and the clay industry , is now hinting broadly that , to get the labor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiked .
