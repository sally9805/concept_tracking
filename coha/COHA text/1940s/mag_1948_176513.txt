Fifty-one members of the National Press Club in Washington were polled on the question : Who will win ? Result : Dewey , 50 ; Truman , 1 . The man who cast the dissenting vote : Harry Truman , who , as President , is a lifetime member of the club . <P> The Chicago Tribune , sadly contemplating the Dewey program , found that it contained " some of the worst features of the New Deal " ( the bipartisan foreign policy , farm-support prices , reclamation and public power projects ) . But the Trib swallowed hard , bit its tongue and announced : " We are for him because , borrowing one of Westbrook Pegler 's better phrases , we consider him the least worse of the candidates . " <P> Southern politicos were at sixes &; sevens . Alabama 's Governor Jim Folsom and Georgia 's Acting Governor Melvin Thompson urged support of Harry Truman despite the civil-rights program . Memphis ' Boss Crump , still fence-sitting a fortnight ago , climbed down on the Dixiecrat side , causing a split with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint cry of defiance and came out for Truman . <P> The LIFE-like Negro magazine , Ebony , printed the pictures of all four candidates , urged its 2,000,000 readers to vote for anyone except Thurmond . " Negro voters . . . are intelligent enough , " said Ebony , " to make up their minds on the issues of the election without special racial appeals . " <P> Columnist Harold Ickes finally announced that he would support Harry Truman . Said the terrible-tempered Mr. Ickes , who resigned as Secretary of the Interior and broke with the President in 1946 : " As between Thomas Elusive Dewey , the candidate in sneakers , I prefer to support Mr. Truman , who is straightforward and sincere , if at times more unpredictable than I would wish .
