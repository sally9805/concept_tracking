" How duz yo ' sym'tums seem ter segashuate ? " sez Brer Rabbit , sezee . . . en de <P> Tar-Baby , she ai n't sayin ' nothin ' . " How you come on , den ? Is you deaf ? " <P> Brer Rabbit , sezee . " Kaze if you is , I kin holler louder , " sezee . Tar-Baby stay still , en Brer Fox , he lay low . <P> President Harry Truman just sat there , like the Tar-Baby . The most untroubled man in the U.S. last week seemed to be its President . <P> At his press conference the President still had nothing to say , no announcements to make . Questions poured in from newsmen . The skidding stockmarket ? The President was interested , of course . But he had no comment . The maritime strike ? Still in the hands of the Department of Labor . A special session of Congress ? The President did n't think there was any emergency that would require it ; Congressmen were entitled to an uninterrupted spell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Here was something the President would know about and would be interested in . But still he said nothing . The only official hint came from Press Secretary Charlie Ross : a couple of speeches , but no barnstorming tour . <P> But Capitol newsmen were betting that the President would find it hard to resist the urge for on-the-spot electioneering in such critical hotspots as California , Pennsylvania and his home state of Missouri . <P> <P> The correspondents figured he would obey the impulse to salvage something in November , and that when the time came , he 'd be off like Brer Rabbit lippity-clippity , clippity-lippity-just a sailin ' down de big road .
