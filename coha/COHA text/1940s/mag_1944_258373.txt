Decision ( by Edward Chodorov , produced by Edward Choate ) , if no great shakes as a play , is vigorous pamphleteering on a vital subject . Playwright Chodorov has highlighted the home-front struggle between the free-and the fascist-minded , pitting a fearless high-school principal against a viciously reactionary senator who has engineered a race riot in a war plant . Assailed , the senator strikes back , has the principal framed on a rape charge and then cleverly murdered-to give the impression that he hanged himself out of guilt . Thereafter Decision focuses on the principal 's wounded-soldier son who had returned from war confident that democracy faced no perils at home . Even when confronted by his father 's murder , he is slow to exchange personal rage for fighting awareness . <P> Decision is sometimes too preachy , often too lurid . It crams the son 's complex reorientation into a single scene . Moreover , if Decision gains in sharpness by keeping its drama human and local , it loses in stature : though representative , its characters do not have behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But on its own terms Decision hits hard . And though melodramatic in plot , it is sober in tone . For all its earnestness , Decision makes lively theater . For all its unevenness , it is the season 's most thought-provoking play . <P> Less successful in the theater than his younger brother Jerome ( My Sister Eileen , Junior Miss ) , stocky , swart , 39-year-old Edward Chodorov has been more adventurous . Besides landing solidly with his psychological thriller , Kind Lady , he wobbled about in farce ( Wonder Boy ) and a romance ( Those Endearing Young Charms ) before turning to polemic in Decision . <P> Like his brother , he has been stage-struck since childhood . Living in Manhattan , he chose to go to a high school in Brooklyn because Jane Cowl and other stagefolk had gone there . He dashed straight from Brown University to Broadway , sat around in automats dissecting the drama with an aspiring young friend named Moss Hart . Later he sat at the feet of " the master , " Jed Harris . Harris produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Hollywood ( Craig 's Wife , Yellow Jack ) , for Chodorov , is purely bread- &-butter.; <P> Quiet and untemperamental , Chodorov is also stubborn , even cantankerous ; he wears a hat in warm weather , goes without one in cold . He wrote Decision over all his friends ' protests . Says he : " Every other medium of intellectual dissemination has gone at the problem , and it was about time the theater did . " Now he wants to do " a wonderful play about the theater itself . "
