When the University of Chicago 's President Robert Maynard Hutchins emerged from a meeting of the University 's Senators ( full professors ) last week , he was smiling-some thought , with a stiff upper lip . Ninety-four out of 136 professors present had cast what amounted to a vote of no confidence in Hutchins ' basic idea of a university . <P> President Hutchins believes , and has said ( TIME , May 1 ) that a university should crusade for " a moral , intellectual and spiritual revolution . " The faculty prefers the orthodox academic position : the advancement of knowledge by research and teaching independent of any moral commitment except to " the Truth . " <P> Among President Hutchins ' most ardent supporters is the University 's gangling , witty literary handyman , Milton Mayer . Mayer is a onetime Chicago news and publicity man , studied under Hutchins at the University , later helped him teach his famed course on the 100 Best Books . Wrote Mayer in Wisconsin 's weekly Progressive : <P> " Mr. Hutchins is trying to overturn American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to revolutionize the modern world , and when a great big handsome president of a great big handsome university goes revolutionary , it is time to sit up and take notice . He is proposing a little island of socialism in a capitalistic country . ... A university , he says , is a ' consecrated community ' to seek the salvation of men 's minds . Hutchins wants to free professors from the pressure to pursue mink coats for their wives , or for somebody else 's wives , and assure them a modest competence based on need . <P> " I have a fihrer complex about Mr. Hutchins . . . the best and wisest man I know . ... I think he is bored running the colossal war plant which the University of Chicago now is . ... So ... he decided to stage a one-man commando raid on the unguarded shrine of Let-Well-Enough-Alone . ... I believe that Mr. Hutchins is a menace to all the sacred precepts that have produced the glorious civilization we are now enjoying . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
