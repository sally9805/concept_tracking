 | The American Invasion of Britain Condensed from Fortune Charles J. V. Murphy WINSTON CHURCHILL has pictured Anglo-American relations as a broad Mississippi of commingled purpose and destiny gliding irresistibly to " broader lands and better days . " Yet there are unaccountable forces capable of roiling the flow of this mighty stream . High long these is the temptation for the o nations to meddle in each other 's affairs . Concerning this , Mr. ChurchilI remarked lightly not long ago that f we had not first declared our independence of the British they by now would doubtless be declaring their independence of us . Our emergence as wealthier partner and world 's strongest power has been at the expense of certain able privileges of the past : the right , fur example , to twist the British lion 's tail . This exciting sport passed as foreign relations with early generations of Americans . The British could be counted upon to brush it off as a distant annoyance . But now , as the world 's strongest power , we must pay the penalty of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be twisted and our personal characteristics to be unfavorably compared . Americans who used to blame the British for paying too little attention to what we thought are now protesting that they are " unduly sensitive . " So they are ? and with good reason . In their recent White Paper the British , to dispel the widely held American notion that nothing was coming back under Lend-Lease , enumerated their physical and material contributions under what they describe as Mutual Aid . This was apart from their share of the fighting and blood-letting , in which they know , even if they do not noisily claim , the proportions do them no discredit . Also missing from the balance is an item whose net worth in sheer human wear and tear would seem to be past figuring ? the patience with which the British have " coped " with American ways . The American has been brought up to regard the Britisher as smug , staid , incurably insular , and resolutely indifferent to the concerns of others . But these qualities give the Briton little protection today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overrun by Americans . Last winter he measured them by thousands ; now the " invasion , " as he glumly calls it , has run into hundreds of thousands . Just the physical ordeal of making room becomes nerve-racking after a while . The British have turned over entire ports to the U. S. Navy . They have moved out of villages to provide billets for our troops . Even fields and hedges , lovingly tended for generations , have been opened to the mercies of our tank crews , who must have room for maneuvers . " I 'm beginning to understand what the American Indian went through , " an Englishman recently commented . The trains , movies , pubs , taxis , hotels ? particularly in London ? are filling with Americans . In the dining rooms of Claridge 's and the Savoy , the shoulder insignia of American officers gleam as brightly as they do in Washington 's Carlton ? and Englishmen at times are quite as scarce . The British mourn their own disappearance with a popular song the first line of which they parody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This raises a touchy point affecting the Anglo-American partnership ? the amount of spending money in the richer partner 's possession . According to travelers , people all over the world have been delighted by the way Americans throw money around . But in heavily taxed and strictly rationed England , American spending raises soeial issues that affect British pride . A British Tommy 's base pay is roughly $15 a month , against an American private 's $6o ( counting overseas allowance ) . After the Brit is Treasury has been satisfied , he lucky to be able to treat himself an his friends to an occasional round o beer , let alone stand treat for hard drinking Americans . Thus he is made to feel poor and mean in his own pubs . Similarly , the RAF squadron leader draws about $175 a month against an American major 's $400 . He finds dinner for two at a good hotel an extremely stiff proposition , what with the dinner costing $5.50 and a bottle of dubious French wine $8 . One can imagine the mischief the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the London Daily Mail recently appealed to Americans to stop paying taxi drivers ten shillings for a two-shilling ride , barbers ten shillings for a two-shilling haircut , bartenders five shillings for a half-crown drink , and bootblacks a half crown for a sixpenny shoeshine . " You 've made it hard for me to get a haircut , buddy , " he wrote . " And the bartender serves you first . " The editor of a powerful London daily mentioned that in his neighborhood it was almost impossible to keep a cook or housemaid . American officers clubbing together were offering double the English wage . The same tactics are driving up rents . Canadians , whose pay scale is between ours and the British , have held down the competitive purchasing power of their troops in Britain by retaining part of their pay , to be given them on their return . Our men are under no such restraint , although officials say that with family allotments , war bonds , and so on , Ameri-  | can soldiers are spending on an aver- age only 3o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprees of those who do spend their money will forever keep the Englishman from remembering the American as a tightwad . Every hotel has its tales of young American airmen on leave who check in with ? 2oo or ? 25o and blow it all in three more or less glorious nights . There are extenuating circumstances , of course . This hell raising is done by hard-working men , a Ito by honored American practice have earned a blowoff . They arrive from lonely , uncomfortable billets . And they regard London as the Paris of World War II . The Londoner knows this and tries to put lip with it , but he ca n't help wishing that Americans were less exuberant . On the question of pay differential a high-ranking American officer tells me that it would be criminal to think if penalizing the American fighting Hen overseas just to spare British feelings . It would only make trouble by widening the differential between them and the war workers back home . On that score there can be no quarrel . But on the other hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . There are other American habits and attitudes that baffle , and sometimes irritate , the Englishman . He is touchy over Americans ' scorn for mild , warm beer , the toy railway carriages and freight cars , and the plumbing that either does n't flush or else flushes with a violence that leaves the American embarrassed and dismayed . Nor can the Englishman understand why American soldiers like to hang around Oxford Circus and along Piccadilly , hands in pockets , whistling at the girls . He has an immense respect for American airmen whose formations sweep so majestically over his city , but it is his measured opinion that the American soldier is " sloppy " and " undisciplined . " Britain is populated by millions of shopkeepers , taxi drivers , farmers and home guardsmen who arc surprised and a little disillusioned that an American soldier should want to decorate himself with an " area " ribbon just for setting foot on British soil or for being in service before Pearl Harbor . Having just got around to awarding medals to their own veterans of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help feeling let down to be told by a young American fighting man with a solid row of ribbons that he has vet to see the enemy or hear a shot fired in anger . A story now making the rounds in London concerns an American who went to see the British battle film Desert Victory . As he left the theater he was seen to pin a campaign ribbon to his tunic . Doubtless all this discussion of ribbons only proves that there is a British and also an AmeriGean way of doing things . However the fact remains that in the Englishman 's eyes the ribbons our Army gives men for crossing the ocean represent " Hollywood values . " Conscientious efforts are being made to teach the British and Americans to understand each other . There are clubs where they can get together and eat and dance , quiz sessions where they ask each other questions ,  | home parties where little groups of American salesmen and mechanics sit down with their British counterparts and swap ideas . Oxford and Cambridge have opened short courses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small groups for training with each other 's forces in the hope of hastening mutual understanding . Often these clever ideas work ? and then it 's pretty wonderful . But good Anglo-American relations are going to depend upon more than such ideas and upon more than having Mr. Churchill continue to meet with Mr. Roosevelt and make dramatic decisions in high strategy . The American , it is time we realized , is peculiar fellow , with his silk stocking and lipsticks with which to coax t British lovelies , and his pockets full of oranges and candy in a besieged island where the richest peers are denied such luxuries . The point , therefore , is not the familiar and unsatisfactory one that the Americans and British are different It is that the peculiarities of the British , their bullheaded insistence o British ways , their affected accents and swagger sticks , add up to perhaps less than half of the total explaination of why Anglo-American refutions , like the course of true love , what they are .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
