died of heart failure and Sam Rayburn ascended from the majority leader 's desk in the well of the House , to the chair of the Speaker on the rostrum . For Rayburn so longs to revive the grand traditions of Longworth and Garner that he has even estab , fished a Bureau of Education of his own ; yet he is confronted with a congressional situation that would have appalled Henry Clay and Tom Reed in the days of their brightest glory . In the House that Rayburn must manage , the Republicans form a compact , belligerent minority , while the Democratic majority is large but undependable . Among the Democrats are enough anti-RooseveItians , led by the able Clifton Woodrum , of Virginia , to make almost any vote close if they unite with the opposition . There are also enough strong New Dealers to prevent Rayburn from taking his stand with the anti-Rooseveltians , even if he were so inclined . Thus Rayburn is in the midst of a continual pull devil , pull baker , and can hardly avoid such distressing defeats as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new House is not much different from the old , and his only chance to be master is along the most difficult road of all  --  by restraining the President from too imperious gestures , soothing the anti-Rooseveltians until their party loyalty reawakens , and eventually reconciling these irreconcilables . . J1 Plain Man From Texas l HE odds are against Rayburn at the start , but it is anybody 's guess whether he will succeed in the end . Neither his history nor his personality affords a reliable clue to the future . He began life humbly , as one of a family of fourteen crowded into a small frame house on forty acres of the Texas black-belt cotton lands . Until he was grown , he was less used to the confinement of shoes than to the feel of the form 's chocolatey loam on his bare feet . He scrabbled for an education , scrambled into politics , and rose slowly in his chosen trade because he was a good fellow , a thorough organization man and an inordinately hard worker . He has now been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has never learned to assume the consequential air , or to move with the conspicuous strut , of the self-conscious statesman , In appearance , indeed , he is distinctly unobtrusive , being short , stocky and energetic , with quiet manners , a self-contained expression and the general air of an industrious apprentice who has got on in the world . He lives extremely simply , in a small , two-room service apartment ; is much embarrassed by the grandeur of the official limousine that came to him with the Speakerehip , and except for well-cut , strictly conservative clothes , permits himself no personal extravagance . His pleasures are as simple as his life . He is a passionate fisherman , and spends most week ends whipping the Maryland ponds for bass and crappie . Besides fishing , his one enthusiasm is the herd of prize Jersey cattle he keeps on the family farm in Texas . His sole eccentricity is at table , where he has a weakness for such add dishes as Southern corn bread soaked in heavy cream , and double lamb chops for breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particularly enjoys borrowing a friend 's kitchen , putting on a white apron and preparing Southern-style fried chicken for five or six selected cronies . His real intimates are few , chiefly masculine , and chiefly members and former members of the House or associates of his young days in Texas . Rather distant and secretive with most people , he relaxes completely with his own circle , indulging himself in long evenings of rambling , cracker-barrel talk . These he arranges at regular intervals , for he is orderly minded , and tends to reduce even his amusements to a routine . For instance , although he has never flayed cards and would not think of joining an eight-dollar-limit game , he likes to take supper regularly once a month with the high-stake poker crowd in the House . Dining out he actively detests , and if he can be induced to dine in evening dress , his hostess feels she has scored a solid triumph . In short , the casual eye would take him for an amiable specimen of a common type  --  the slightly shy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit his tastes as an old dog shapes his bed to his carcass . There is more than that , however , to Sam Rayburn . Besides his determined ambition , he has shrewdness , stick-to-itiveness and an unusual capacity for business . Long experience has given him a thorough grasp of the techniques of legislation  --  the application of the complex rules , the endless horse trading between groups and sections , the highly specialized tactics of committee , conference and debate , all of which an aspirant to leadership in the American Congress must understand . Finally , he knows how to command the House 's respect and affection , even when things are not going his way . Without such equipment he could never have risen to his present place . Forecasting his Speakerahip is difficult only because no one knows whether he also has the extra gumption and boldness , tact and hard common sense required to persuade the President and his enemies to forget their mutual hatreds . This feat has already been attempted by many , but accomplished by none . Dealing with the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Garner , wielding the Speaker 's power to block any presidential program , would have found it easy . Both held the White House in cheerful contempt , and both vastly enjoyed teaching the unhappy Herbert Hoover to know his place , by upsetting all his measures until he learned to accept their advice with proper meekness . This sort of thing is a little beyond their disciple , however . Rayburn is deeply orthodox in his organization loyalty , attached to the President both personally and as head of his party , and sometimes slightly overawed to find himself , plain Sant , Rayburn from a Texas dirt farm . in the presence of the squire of Hyde Park and the master of the White House . Sometimes , in truth , Rayburn seems to yield to the President with remarkable ease . The Cup and the Lip AT THE Chicago convention , for example , he had every reason to expect the vice-presidential nomination . The Garneritea would have been pacified by the compliment to their candidate 's protegk . The group of New Dealers headed by Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting caucus of the Texas delegation after the balloting on the presidency , he had downed the aspiring Jesse H. Jones and obtained his state 's unanimous pledge . He had also received a seeming green light from Harry L. Hopkins , the President 's maladroit Chicago manager . Naturally , therefore , he was filled with joy when he received word during the day before the convention session on the vice-presidential nominee , that the White House wanted him on the telephone . His joy redoubled , so the story goes , when the President told him , " Sam , I want you to do me a great favor , " for that sounded like a polite preliminary to the request he hoped for . Yet when the President briskly continued , " I want you to make a seconding speech for Henry Wallace , " Rayburn gulped down his hopes and went along like a good soldier . Nevertheless , there are also several curious , little-known signs that the President can not always count on such acquiescence as Rayburn gave him at Chicago . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's Monday-morning conferences with his congressional chiefs . It happened after the President had sent an important new message to the House every day for three days running . Each day he failed to notify Speaker Bankhead that a message was on the way . Each day Bankbead told newspapermen before the session that no message was expected . And each day the arrival of a message fifteen minutes later made Bankhead look a fool . Rayburn , who feels a personal concern for the dignity of the House , and therefore of the Speakership , was profoundly distressed . Being majority leader at the time , he was not immediately involved , and could not complain directly to the President . But he spoke sharply to James Roosevelt , then his father 's secretary , and managed to get the idea of the 1$.1011-day conferences conveyed to the President through several other channels . The President adopted the scheme as his own brain child . The conference system , promptly initiated , proved very useful . Meanwhile , Rayburn had sketched out a charter of his own future rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's son . " I tell you , Jimmy , " he said . " if Um ever Speaker , this kind of thing wo n't happen to me more than once . " The Speakership Tradition The fact is , where most men are less bold in the White House than they talk when they leave it , the quiet-spoken Rayburn has been firmer than is generally imagined . There have been times when he could not stand up against the President , but there have also been times when the President yielded to him . One such was when he refused a pressing presidential request to weaken the Smith committee investigating the Labor Relations Board , because he thought the investigation wise . Another was when he restrained the President from political reprisals against the embittered anti-New Dealer , Gene Cox , of Georgia . A close Rayburn crony , Cox is the strongest member of the vital House Rules Committee , which settles the procedure of debate and amendment on most items of legislation coming before the House . The President and Cox are as hard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Cox distrusts the President only slightly less than the President detests Cox . Yet Rayburn managed to prevent the outbreak of open war , by giving a blunt warning , " Hell , Mr. President , you ca n't go after Gene Cox . He 's at least five votes on the Rules Committee . He 's the difference . " Such is the conflicting evidence . There is only one more element in the puzzle of Sam Rayburn ? the reinforcement of his ambition to be master by his own pride , and by the peculiar conditioning of his long House service . After Rainey , Byrns and Bankhead , the first two weak Speakers , the third a very ill man , the traditions of the Speakership are beginning to he forgotten by the man in the street . They are recalled all the more clearly , on the other hand , by Rayburn and the other older members and permanent officials who are really soaked in the lore of the House . Every man thus impregnated breathes something of the spirit of John Hampden , secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were a Roundhead faced with Charles I and Strafford 's House of Lords . He wants the House to be strong , and because the House is so large and amorphous that it can not be strong without leadership , he wants the Speaker to be strong too . Rayburn feels he has a duty in the matter , and if he fails to do his duty it will be a bitter blow to his pride . " A man does n't learn his job in the House , " he often says , " until he 's had his head damn well bloodied a couple of times , but a leader may as well quit if his head is bloodied too often . " If Rayburn fails , his career will he a pretty parable of human ambition . He will find his triumph turning to dust and ashes in his mouth , after laboriously climbing to a peak he could scarcely imagine when he started upward . Among the great officers of the American state , the Speaker of the House of Representatives willingly grants precedence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed the right to march before the Vice President ever since the Longworth-Gann episode . Yet Rayburn , now Speaker , was born to harsh poverty , in obscure surroundings . When the Civil War broke out , his father , William Marion Rayburn , was heir to a fairly prosperous farmstead in the Clinch River Valley , in Roane County , Tennessee . Joining Lee 's troops at eighteen , he fought through to the surrender at Appomattox , made his way home from Virginia on foot when the Yankees stole his horse , and found his house pillaged , his stock gone and his fields ravaged . With this grim start in life he boldly married Martha Waller , a fine , forthright countrywoman , produced eleven children , and for more than twenty years struggled to wrest a living from his land for himself and his family . Sam , born January 6 , 1882 , and officially christened Samuel Taliaferro , was the eighth child . Five years after he entered the world his father abandoned the unequal contest , sold out in Tennessee , and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of the black-belt lands , he led them to Fannin County , where he bargained for forty acres and a house about eleven miles from the little town of Bonham . And there the Rayburns settled , with a wandering uncle to make up the household 's number to fourteen . J1 Political Cradle The first summer all but finished them . William Rayburn had been a corn farmer in Tennessee , did not understand cotton culture , and was helpless when damp weather destroyed all but two and a half bates of his crop . But the whole family worked hard , planting , chopping and picking cotton together , and somehow they kept food in their bellies and clothing on their hacks . Though he did his stint with the others , young Sam grew up a little apart from his brothers and sisters , for he had ideas of his own . His father , a Southern fire-eater after his experiences with the Yankees , took a passionate interest in politics , and subscribed for the South 's two leading political papers , the Louisville Courier-Journal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to . Sam , who picked up his three R 's quickly at the little country school , soon became a fervent reader of the political news , spelling out the long columns when his father was finished with them . He says now he ca n't remember when he decided to go into politics , because it was too far back . It must have been very early indeed , for the famous Texas orator , Joe Bailey , was his pattern of human perfection before he was ten years old . His favorite reminiscence is of the first time he heard Bailey speak , when he was just ten . Bailey , then representative from the Fannin County district , had come to Bonham to address a big meeting of his constituents at the county fairgrounds . On the advertised date of the meeting , Sam 's elder brothers were ahead of him in getting their father 's permission to attend-Sam 's chore was to haul wood for the winter . That morning Sam watched his brothers riding off to town , and for the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodlot with scalding tears streaming down his face . At breakfast on the morning following , however , after describing the excitement of the rally , his brothers let it drop that Bailey had consented to stay over and speak again . Sam leaped up from the breakfast table , washed his feet at the pump , threw a saddle on a pony , and was off to Bonham at a gallop , all in an instant . By whipping his pony every step of the way , he reached j the fairgrounds just in time to see Bailey , arrayed in the broadcloth and fine linen of Southern statesmanship , making his grand entrance into the " tabernacle " where he was to speak . " I did n't go into that tabernacle , " says Rayburn , with a rather sentimental gleam . " I 'd never been to Bonham since we bought the farm , and I was scared of all the rich townfolks in their store clothes . But I found a flap in the canvas , and I stuck there like glue while old Joe Bailey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , and I scarcely drew breath the whole time . I slipped round to the entrance again when he was through , saw him come out , and ran after him five or six blocks until he got on a streetcar . Then I went home , wondering whether I 'd ever be as big a man as Joe Bailey . " Doggedness is one of the strongest traits in Rayburn 's character . For seven years , while he was growing up , his plan for his future never changed . When he was just seventeen , knowing he needed more education than was offered by the Fannin County schools , he asked his father whether he might go to college . They were working side by aide in the cotton fields , sweating under a blazing sun . The father looked at the boy a little sadly . " Sam , " he said , " you know I 'd like for you to go . But how can I send you to college with only forty acres in the farm and fourteen of us in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , paw , " replied Sam . " I asked for you to let me go . I figure I can earn my own way . " The father gave in . That fall Sam was presented with twenty-five dollars , all the cash in the Rayburn household , and journeyed to Commerce , Texas , to attend East Texas Normal College . The principal was W. L. Mayo , one of those pioneer educators whose desire to serve their communities amply compensated for any deficiency in their scholastic standards . He heard Sam 's story , helped him to find one job sweeping the Commerce schoolhouse , gave him another ringing the college bell , and promised to let him have the rest of his education on credit . Sam went through college with a cash income of around eight dollars monthly , and taught school afterward to pay his debt . Then , in 1906 , at the green age of twenty-four , he announced his candidacy for the Texas legislature . Toward the Potomac Without money , an issue or experience , he had no assets but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He exploited all three to the full , riding back and forth across Fannin County , visiting every farm and village and town , for three months on end . When election day came , he licked his opponent , the Hon. Sam Gardiner , of Honey Grove , by 163 votes . And so , at last a lawmaker , he went to Austin for the session . In those days the Texas legislature was a breezy , untamed body , full of rampageous young men on the threshold of political careers . Rayburn did not live high in Austin , saving his five dollars per diem to go to law school between sessions , but he threw himself into all the legislative excitement , tangled in all the rows , and made friends everywhere who could give him a leg up . In his third term , when he was still only twenty-nine , his colleagues named him speaker . That gave him his watchfully awaited chance . He presided over a stormy session , getting through , as he recalls , " by God , ignorance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Joe Bailey , now a senator , and suspected of improper familiarity with the Standard Oil Company . Rayburn defended his childhood ideal , and Bailey showed his gratitude by coming out for Rayburn for his former congressional seat . Again Rayburn lacked both money and an issue , and this time he had six opponents , but he pleaded with the voters , " If you have anything for me , give it to me now , " and he won a hard fight by 405 votes . A few months later he was on his way to Washington , a full-blown congressman , dressed in store clothes himself , to attend Woodrow Wilson 's first inauguration . Off on Right Foot At the inaugural , Rayburn was pretty terrified until he procured an introduction to Martin Littleton . Littleton was an old neighbor , who had set out from the Clinch River Valley sometime before the Rayburn hegira , had become a successful advocate and Tammany congressman , and had won great fame by rescuing Harry Thaw from the clutches of William Travers Jerome . Rayburn had often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been friends . As soon as Littleton learned who Rayburn was , he showed him round the Capitol , invited him to his hotel to watch the inaugural parade , and comforted him with good , practical advice . Among other things , he urged Rayburn to seek a place on the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce . Rayburn immediately applied to Garner , then just named to the House Committee on Ways and Means , and as a Democratic member of Ways and Means , also a member of the party caucus ' Committee on Committees . Habitually helpful to fellow Texans , Garner got Rayburn the Commerce Committee place he wanted . For Rayburn , the meeting with Littleton was a happy accident , since the Commerce Committee suited him so well he remained on it for twenty-four years , and used it in the end to make his name in the world . Of Rayburn 's early terms in Congress , little need be said . He spent his mornings answering his mail , running errands for his constituents and attending committee meetings . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent his evenings at his hotel , the old Cochran , one of the legislative warrens of the period , where he could drink in the wisdom of Judge Cordell Hull and other veterans . Such are the duties of a young congressman . Rayburn fulfilled them punctually but inconspicuously , being so cautious at first that he neither expressed an opinion in committee meeting nor dared to vote against the chairman for au entire year . He did not begin to emerge from his obscurity until his ripening friendship with Garner gave him a place in the Bureau of Education crowd . In effect , throughout the period when Longworth and Garner dominated the House together , the Bureau of Education was a select club within the House . Ray burn 's admission to it set him off from his fellows , much as election to the best fraternity will set off a boy at college . It also opened avenues of advancement to him . For one thing , he caught the tone and learned the tricks of leadership . Leadership , in our House and Senate , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible to make a composite portrait of the natural leader . He is a good fellow , sociable , and fond of masculine society . He is astute in handling other men , clever in perceiving motives and a good observer of the habits and appetencies of his colleagues . He is essentially somewhat conservative , but rarely grows emotional over political issues and never " demagogues when the doors are closed . " The practical aspects of party management are what chiefly interest him , and he becomes a leader in the end because he regards politics as a game , and plays the game with the inexhaustible pleasure of a horn gambler at a card table . Among recent important leaders , Longworth , Garner , Rayburn , Joe Robinson , Pat Harrison . Charles McNary and James F. Byrnes , though varying greatly in character and ability , have all belonged to this type . Rayburn might not have , for he has a somewhat solemn side lacking in most of the others , if his innumerable hours in the Bureau of Education had not formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task , the bureau gave him immediate opportunities to demonstrate his abilities . In the perpetual trade in favors which is the daily commonplace in all legislative bodies , the bureau crowd stuck together . The older men worked to advance the younger , and the younger men supported their patrons . For instance , in the period when the bureau crowd was just dissolving , Rayburn joined Garner 's favorite lieutenant , genial John McDuffie , of Alabama , the man who gave the bureau its name , to put John McCormack , of Massachusetts , on the important Ways and Means Committee . In return , McCormack later organized badly needed Northern Democratic support for Rayburn 's candidacy for the majority leadership . Now McCormack , still Rayburn 's close ally , has become majority leader himself in succession to Rayburn , thus completing the process . Similarly , Garner and McDuffie allowed Rayburn a constantly increasing voice in the councils of the House Democrats , employed him to do big jobs in tough fights , and were repaid by his hard-working loyalty . By 1931 , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commerce Committee , he was already one of the small group of members who really counted in the House . His chairmanship of the Commerce Committee was what made him a national figure . Always eager for responsibility , and now in a position to take it , he longed to sponsor important measures . His first effort in this direction was the Federal communications hill , establishing the present Communications Commission , which he and Garner planned together . When he had his bill drafted , Rayburn took it down to Lewis Deschler , the capable House parliamentarian , and asked him point-blank , " Lew , can this be referred to my committee ? Because if the rules say it ca n't , I 'm going to rewrite it so it can . " A Legislative Pilot Deschler 's answer was satisfactory , and the communications bill ultimately became the first of a series of memorable statutes piloted to passage by Rayburn . The next was the truth-insecurities bill of 1933 . There was doubt as to which committee should he allowed to handle it , and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chair , consulted Rayburn on the problem . " I want it , " Rayburn told him at once . " Give it to the Commerce Committee , Henry , and I wo n't forget the favor . " Glad to find so easy a way out , Rainey hastily consented , and the bill was brought to Rayburn by its young New Deal draftsmen , James M. Landis and Benjamin V. Cohen . He had not the slightest experience of its subject matter , but he held prolonged hearings , doggedly questioning witness after witness , in order to get his bearings . He was overwhelmed by lobbyists , but he hates them with the fury of a stubbornly honest man , and he brushed them off . In the end he shoved the bill through the House with some ease . It was less easy the next year , when he handled the exchanges bill establishing the Securities and Exchange Commission . The conservative interests had been aroused from their depression-induced state of shock , and Rayburn had to fight a powerful opposition constantly spurred onward by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year after that , when he beat the strongest lobby ever mustered at the Capitol to oppose a piece of legislation , and pushed the **25;1696;TOOLONG bill through to final passage . The holding-company bill was Ray-burn 's major legislative achievement . From the technical standpoint , his handling of the bill was remarkable , for he made himself quite as familiar with its details as Ben Cohen and Tom Corcoran , the men who had written it , and thus stood ready to ward off attacks at any time frum any quarter . The attacks were innumerable and violent , and for a time Rayburn seemed to be near defeat , when the death-sentence clause was modified in the House . But when the clause was strengthened again in fhe Senate , Rayburn succeeded in forcing House assent to the conference report , and emerged from the fight in triumph . The triumph was in some sense a turning point in his career . During the struggle he had become the President 's good friend . He was already liked and respected by the New Dealers . Although still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had enough of the countryman 's distaste for Wall Street to make his views acceptable to the President and the men around him . Pleased by his success , they therefore chose him out as their man in the House . Rayburn needed the fresh support . The bureau crowd had been out since 1933 , when John McDutfie , whom Rayburn backed , had been beaten for the Speakership by a deal between Rainey and Joseph Byrns . When Rainey died , in 1934 , McDuffie was on the point of resigning from the House , and Rayburn himself prematurely declared for the Speakership , only to be beaten by Byrns , and to see Bankhead become Byrns ' majority leader . At length , in 1936 , Byrns also died . Bank-head was immediately named Speaker , and Rayburn promptly announced his candidacy for the majority leadership . His opponent was John O'Connor , of New York , then chairman of the House Rules Committee , an ambitious man who had used his power to distribute many favors where they would do the most good . Besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Connor also rallied the Northern Democrats to his standard , on the plea that Southerners always got everything . At first , in fact , O'Connor seemed sure to win . Then the tide of battle turned . McCormack came out for Rayburn , breaking the Northerners ' front . Garner hurried back from Torn% saw the President , and told reporters on the White House steps that he was " 200 per cent for Rayburn . " Both Garner and the President privately paaqed the word in the necessary quarters , and the then satrap of Pennsylvania , Sen. Joseph F. Guffey , commanded his herd of Pennsylvania representatives to amble into the Rayburn camp . The Pennsylvania votes gave Rayburn the edge , and he was elected to the majority leadership in December , 1936 . A House Divided Rayburn was a successful but not a brilliant leader . Throughout his leadership , the same factors were at work in the House that will plague him in his Speakership . From the time of the court fight on , the Democrats were divided by a violent schism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , when Joseph W. Martin , of Massachusetts , became their captain . To add to his difficulties , Rayburn had to cope with the Democratic schism and parry the Republican thrusts from a subordinate position , without much assistance from Speaker Bankhead . On the whole , Rayburn surmounted his difficulties very successfully . He was beaten only once on a major measure , the reorganization bill of 1937 , when John O'Connor revenged his disappointment by taking a chief part in the opposition . He was more often forced to submit to minor setbacks , since his polls of the House tended to be optimistic ; it was not easy to whip the big but strife-ridden majority into its seats , and the Republicans , always ready to vote solidly themselves , were quick to round up Democratic rebels to swell , their total . If there is a serious criticism of his leadership , however , it is simply that he was always reluctant to be tough . Garner would shout his followers down , threaten them with dire penalties , call them black names , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayburn , on the other hand , has a theory that a member of Congress deserves a certain respect as the chosen spokesman of his constituency , and he makes it a rule never to let a man leave him angry . " Even if you have to jump up and atop them when they 're going out the door , " he says , " you ought to do it . If you 're square with them , they will always understand your reasons when you 're patient enough . " Because he was both square and patient , he managed to puss a vast mass of legislation without losing the affection and good opinion of either the President or the House . This in itself , at a time when the conflict between the Capitol and the White House has rarely been so hitter , was no mean accomplishment . If he hopes to outdo it now as Speaker , it is because he has greater power himself , and in the person of John McCormack , a strong henchman . The task he has assigned himself " bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impossible . The Speaker 's authority is only dormant , not dead . He is the House 's elected chieftain , and thus in council ought to represent his chamber of the legislative branch as no individual can represent the Senate . He has well-nigh absolute control over procedure on the House floor , and is the final interpreter of the House 's manifold rules and 11,000 precedents . He is senior to the majority leader , and has the right to be consulted on the legislative program . As his influence among House Democrats outweighs the official leader 's , he may also expect his ally , McCormack , to consult him on committee appointments , floor management and general legislative tactics . He will make the best of all these advantages . Many anti-Rooaeveltians are his friends . Some , like Gene Cox , are regular visitors at the new Bureau of Education , where he holds forth in a chamber whose electric icebox is the only note of disloyalty to the past . Yet he can not expect to bring the antiRooseveltians back onto the New Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operation he can count on from McCormack , he must still look to the President to make the concessions required to establish his mastery of the House . If the President succumbs to his persuasions , Sum will he the happiest man in Washington . If the President is adamant , the old conflicts will continue and Rayburn will solace himself with his farm and his fishing . The November adjournment vote hurt him particularly , because it prevented his holiday at the farm . There , being a sentimental fellow , he maintains beds for the entire surviving Rayburn tribe , a hospitable table presided over by his sister , Miss Lou , and good horses to carry him across his acres . Kept from the farm by the fractious House , he sought consolation at Big Mill Pond and Higgins Mill Pond , where he starts fishing after breakfast of a Saturday morning , keeps it up till dusk , goes to bed after dinner , and repeats the same performance an Sundays . The bass sometimes run as heavy as seven pounds , and the little club that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing-minded House members . In the past , Rayburn 's predecessor , Speaker Byrns , was also a fisherman and frequented the little club . He , too , wanted to he master of the House , but somehow he never attained his desire . His disappointment worked in him , and he so often bewailed his lot that the old millstone where he liked to sit , under a shady tree by the club porch , came to be called " Joe Byrns ' wailing stone . " November and December weather does not make for pleasant loitering outdoors , even for a countryman like Rayburn . Yet if he has the slightest impulse to meditation , he must sometimes have seated himself on the wailing stone in these lust weeks , to wonder whether his own future will follow the course he has planned .
