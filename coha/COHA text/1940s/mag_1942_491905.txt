- EW YEAR 'S EVE of 1914 found a tall , thin apparition of a man nervously pacing the  --  corridors of the courtroom in the old Post Office Building . Outside , City Hall Square was a scene of revelry . The New York American was giving a party to welcome in the New Year and , incidentally , increase circulation , and some Indians had been rounded up to do war dances around a Christmas tree . A military band was playing ; there was singing and shouting ; from the harbor the steamboats shrilled their whistles . The merrymaking brought no echo from the figure stalking the corridors . Across the inner courtyard , Lee De Forest could see twelve men arguing wearily whether or not to send him to prison . They had been at it almost twelve hours . Pinched cheeks , throbbing temples , eyes gleaming feverishly in deep sockets , he was like a wire stretched so taut that it might snap any moment . The bells of Trinity Church tolling out the old year sent quivers through that wire . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a minister , too , but Lee had felt himself fated for better things , to be an inventor . As a senior at Yale , awkward , homely and shunned by most of his classmates , he had written in his diary , " I never doubt for a moment my genius that faith which became a part of myself at 13 years of age . Should that fail me or prove false , it would be the most momentous disaster possible , worse than all , even my death . " Was this the destiny he had been so sure of , suffered so much for ? to be sent to the penitentiary in disgrace ? Unhonored Prophet AT ONE A.M. the jury filed in , De Forest had to be helped into the courtroom by his lawyer . De Forest searched the jurors ' faces for the verdict . His heart was pounding and his breath came in such rasping heaves that his lawyer muttered , " What 's the matter with you , De Forest ? " The foreman rose . There were four counts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defraud in the sale of radio-telephone stock ; the fourth , conspiracy to defraud. dames Dunlop Smith , guilty on two counts ; Elmer E. Burlingame , guilty on two counts ; Samuel E. Darby , not guilty on three counts , the jury was disagreed on the fourth ; Lee De Forest , not guilty on counts one , two and three ; the jury was disagreed on the fourth . Some years ago the minutes of that trial were discarded  --  a pity , for there have been few more ironic trials in history . In these articles on the " father of radio " we have been tracing out the career of a man who had to have everything go wrong in his life to achieve greatness . The story reads like a satire on all the ordinary standards of judgment by which society finds one person a success and another a misfit . In this trial , with the courtroom setting and the props of justice handy , the satire rises to climactic crescendo . Summing up his case , the overzealous prosecutor , a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking much like an electric lamp . With this " worthless piece of glass , " he had toldthe jurors , De Forest had claimed " in many newspapers and over his signature that it would be possible to transmit the human voice across the Atlantic before many years . . . absurd and deliberately misleading statements . " All the bulb contained was a filament , a piece of metal , a bit of twisted wire ; when connected , it gave off no more light than a candle . Unfortunately for Mr. Stephenson 's immortal hones , the device he dismissed so contemptuously happened to he the three-element vacuum tube , the heart of radio broadcasting , talking movies , transcontinental and transoceanic telephoning , television and wonders still being born . Stephenson 's failure to appreciate that the device he ridiculed would change the everyday habits of everyone in the courtroom should not be criticized too harshly . De Forest , himself , had worked with the grid audion for five years before discovering that it was an amplifier and , when he brought the tube to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of how it worked . Nor did anyone at the A.T . &; T. dream that this invention would open up the whole astonishing world of electronics . At first the A. T. &; T. bought only limited rights . In October , 1914 , it purchased additional wireless telephone and telegraph rights for $90,000 . Theodore N. Vail , the A. T. &; T. 's president , had promised officials of the Panama Pacific International Exposition that the coast-to-coast telephone would be ready when the exposition opened in San Francisco in 1915 . The A. T. &; T. , naturally , beat its chest at the feat . It put up an amphitheater where it gave a demonstration and illustrated lecture . On their way out , visitors were handed booklets entitled The Story of a Great Achievement . De Forest walked proudly into the amphitheater expecting to hear himself praised as one of those responsible for the transcontinental telephone . Pupin was given due credit for the loading coil ; De Forest was not mentioned . As he read through the sixteen-page booklet , searching vainly for even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shutting himself in his room , all that night he angrily wrote his Story of a Great Achievement . In the morning he stalked to a printer with his copy and an A. T. &; T. booklet . " I want you to make some booklets exactly like this one , " he said , " same size , cover , title . And put my picture where Bell 's is . " Fighting Back D E FOREST handed out his booklets to visitors as they left the A. T. &; T. amphitheater . Down the aisle from the telephone exhibit , he had his own booth . Here lie hung a twelve-foot banner proclaiming , THE DE FOREST AUDION AMPLIFIER , LEASED TO THE AMERICAN TEL . AND TEL . CO . AS A TELEPHONE RELAY , MADE THE TRANSCONTINENTAL LINE POSSIBLE . Late that September , Vail proudly announced that his engineers had talked by wireless telephone from Arlington , Virginia , to Mare Island , California , the voices also being heard in Honolulu . Again De Forest charged that his audion was responsible . Pressed by newspapermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Mr. De Forest 's lamp goes , if it played any part in the wireless conversation with Mare Island it is news to me . " The Mare Island test was only a curtain call for the big show , talking across the Atlantic . De Forest hurried to Paris , hoping to horn in on the performance . The French , he felt , would remember his pioneer radiophone tests from the Eiffel Tower in 1908 . After the war France awarded De Forest the Cross of the Legion of Honor for the audion , but in 1915 La Patrie was too busy noncollaborating with the Germans to listen to an inventor protesting that others were basking in glory rightfully his . De Forest tried to get to the Eiffel Tower , where the tests were being conducted ; gendarmes forced him back . When , on October twenty-first , it was announced that a voice from Arlington had been heard in Paris , all he could do was call French journalists to his hotel and explain that his audion was the miracle worker . In 1913 De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be able to talk across the Atlantic . Less than two years later it was done , with his invention , and he was pushed off to a neglected corner . As a young man , De Forest had leaped into wireless , dreaming that it would prove a short cut to fame and wealth . Instead , with his hair graying , he found himself as hard pressed as ever . If only he could make a third deal with the A. T. &; T. , he thought ; this time for a large enough sum so he could " ease up a little from this strenuous existence . " A stream of patent applications on audion circuits had beeen pouring out of the A. T. &; T. 's engineering mill . De Forest , studying them , found some resembled circuits he had experimented with . Hoping to harass the A. T. &; T. into negotiations , he filed applications covering identical claims . He held more than 80 per cent of the outstanding stock of his company . He approached the A. T. &; T. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to buy De Forest 's stock , but was interested in acquiring his patents . The ? A. T. &; T. needed a license for the regenerative , or feedback circuit , which ( Continued from Page 38 ) simultaneously increased the audion 's sensitivity as an amplifier and made it a transmitter as well . Edwin H. Armstrong , currently famous for his discovery of frequency modulation , had invented the regenerative circuit while a student at Columbia University and had filed for a patent in October , 1913 . Five months later De Forest had applied for the same patent , claiming to have accidentally stumbled on the feedback during the summer of 1912 , while trying to make the audion amplify . De Forest had happened to place the input and outgoing circuits of the audion close together , getting a loud . shrill whistle which indicated that the audion was oscillating . To what extent De Forest understood this whistling and whether his chance discovery established him as the original inventor became the issues of radio 's most celebrated case of litigation . It ran until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputed to have cost $1,500,000 in lawyers ' fees . It was fought with unusual bitterness . When Armstrong won the early suits he strung a banner , with the patent number from his Yonkers home , where De Forest had to see it going to and from his factory . Eventually , Armstrong had to haul down the banner ; the Supreme Court twice ruling in De Forest 's favor . However , the bewilderingly technical controversy still rages in radio circles . The Institute of Radio Engineers awarded Armstrong a medal for the feedback . After the Supreme Court decision , Armstrong returned the medal , whereupon the institute 's board reawarded it to him . When De Forest sought to negotiate his third deal with the A. T. &; T. , there were four claimants to the feedback patent  --  he , Armstrong , Alexander Meissner , and Irving Langmuir , of General Electric . George Folk , the A. T. &; T. 's chief patent attorney , felt that De Forest had as good a chance as anyone to win the coveted patent . Exclusive licenses under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would strengthen the A. T. &; T. for the ultimate reckoning with General Electric and the Marconi Company . At the time all the big corporations were looking to their patent defenses , anticipating a struggle for radio dominance . De Forest 's diary reveals that he feared that patents held by Peter Cooper Hewitt or Reginald A. Fessenden , his old nemesis , might be held valid , making it " impossible for my company to get anywhere . " So hungry was he to sell that he even thought of " a reduction in the amount of cash . " The Golden Temptation The A. T. &; T. did not balk al ; the price . It did lay down stiff terms  --  exclusive rights under all De Forest 's patents and under all vacuum-tube inventions he might make for seven years . He was to give up all rights under his patents to engage in the wireless-telephone field . None of the A. T. &; T. officials were thinking of radio broadcasting , so they threw De Forest the sop of permitting him to manufacture equipment for amateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As De Forest admitted in his diary , the A. T. &; T. 's treaty of peace meant nothing less than that he should abandon " all the ambitions of my struggling years . " In one hand Fate held out before him a bag brimming with a quarter of a million dollars in gold pieces ; in her other hand , concealed behind her back , were untold millions that might be his if he would wait only a few years . Would he seize the sure money or gamble on that unseen hand which might be loaded with fabulous riches or which might be empty ? What choice could this hungry , beset man make ? He writes in his diary , " So at last , after seventeen years of hard and unrelenting toil , with never a letup , never a certainty of success and competency , always with my shoulders to the great stone I was toiling to roll uphill , I have at last reached a safe and secure resting place . " Where Dreams Come True The negotiations with the telephone company were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's company . De Forest got an advance of $30,000 from the A. T. &; T. , which he used to buy back some stock in his company held by Boston financiers . The stratagem , he figured , saved him between $10,000 and $12,000 in dividends . His share of the $250,000 amounted to about $175,000 . The following year , on the strength of the war boom in audions , De Forest drew another $100,000 dividend . " Ah , it is sweet , very sweet , " he exults , " to feel no more the dread uncertainty of the morrow  --  to awake at morning knowing that I am rich , and that my home and business shall not be taken from me , that I can rest , or travel , with no dread as to what enemies or Fate may steal from me in my absence . Now at last I can give a little , now pay my bills when due , now beautify my home , adorn my pretty wife , gratify her desires for singing , for fair array of gems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which I know my long , hard years of toil and planning and self-denial genuinely entitle me . " No more , " he vows , " shall I , as twice before , see my castle of achievement shattered like a house of cards . No more must I start in at the bottom and build on the ruin of Crook 's Calamity a Fourth Fortune . " He was living again at RiverlureWhere Dreams Come True , the home at Spuyten Duyvil which he built out of his second fortune . One afternoon , reading the old Yale diaries , he records , " There came over me such an intense reality of the things I had craved and hungered for . . . that when the dear wife of reality . . . so sweet , so beautiful , stepped like a presence from the old void of dreams into my actual arms , I kissed her rapturously , cleaving to my heart in realest reality all for which the heartspelt pages . . . penned in yearning or sadness plead . " Or , walking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be I , the poor , penniless college lad " who had to live for a week on a three-dollar meal ticket ? And as the " old sorrows , hopes , struggles , heartaches " surge within him , he is driven to create new wonders in this estate which is his Eden . In the center of the lawn he plants a circle of regally colored Darwin tulips , each eighteen inches high . Near by , he places a stone seat fronted by a bed of dazzling white marguerites . He turns the little ditch into a swift brook with an artificial waterfall . No longer a garret inventor , he feels he must work in surroundings fitted to his temperament . Visiting a friend 's villa on the Riviera , he dreams of " a nest near Nice " with a European business as " an outlet and incentive for my constant inventive activities , so that I could work as I played and rested , and breathe deep all those inspirations which France and Italy roused within me . " A few months later , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home here , one on a hillside by the sea and at the foot of the mountains , with a laboratory near by , then my dream of Nice would , I fear , soon vanish away . Which shall it be ? Which shall it be , California or France ? " The war had eliminated the last kinks from the vacuum tube , and what some scientists predict will eventually be known as the " radio age " was ready to be born . While De Forest was weighing the inspirational benefits of Nice and California , a thousand inventions clamored to be discovered . Every form of electrical communication was to be revolutionized . Astonishing opportunities of the sort that come to ordinary men once in a lifetime , if at all , rushed at De Forest , and he missed every one . A fatal shift of stride , a greedy lunge , a faltering , his attention distracted , he pulled up disgustedly  --  his timing was simply shot to pieces . With millions at stake in the race , he lost out again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of Radio Corporation of America . Until 1912 the United Wireless Telegraph Company was easily the dominant wireless concern in this country . United Wireless was an outgrowth of the original De Forest Company , out of which De Forest was kicked in 1906 on the eve of his invention of the grid audion . In 1912 the Marconi Company sued United Wireless for patent infringement , and , when United , whose president , Christopher Columbus Wilson , had been sent to prison , was unable to pay damages , took it over . Two years later De Forest , flush with the first $50,000 from the telephone company , challenged the virtual monopoly enjoyed by the Marconi Company by installing equipment on some ships . L. F. H. Betts , the Marconi attorney , called De Forest for a conference . The Marconi Company held the patent on the Fleming valve , a two-element tube consisting of a filament and plate . In the audion , Betts insisted , De Forest merely added a third element , the grid . If De Forest quit the marine-telegraph field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for an audion license . If not , Betts threatened to sue , charging the audion infringed the Fleming valve . De Forest and his lawyers , believing they could beat the Fleming patent , chose to fight . Freeze-Out The drawn-out litigation , which De Forest could ill afford , resulted in a deadlock . Both the Fleming and audion patents were upheld , so that neither De Forest nor the Marconi Company could make audions . After the war , as a wife and husband not on speaking terms converse through a guest , the two belligerents decided to get their audions through a third party . De Forest was in a good bargaining position , In selling his patents , he had insisted upon one limitation on the telephone company 's exclusive licensing rights  --  only he , De Forest , could license the Marconi Company . R. M. Keator , later De Forest 's plant manager , negotiated the deal . A lampmaker on the Pacific Coast named Moorehead was to manufacture the audions ostensibly for De Forest , who would pass them on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . De Forest would get eighty cents a tube ; the first order for 200,000 netting him $160,000 . A second order of 250,000 audions was placed . But now De Forest thought he might reverse the Fleming-valve verdict if the case were tried in another jurisdiction . A dodge was arranged by which El-man B. Myers , a former assistant and recently in the news as the inventor of a rocket motor , would make some tubes in New Jersey , in the hope that the Marconi Company would sue him . The hope came true , the Moorehead deal being voided simultaneously . Not only did Myers lose the suit but , it developed , De Forest had renewed his quarrel with the Marconi Company precisely when it was being converted into the Radio Corporation . In July , 1920 , the new RCA went to the A. T. &; T. and , through a cross-licensing agreement , obtained the vital audion rights it needed , leaving De Forest in the unincorporated cold . 11 New Frontier With the competition of such giants as General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RCA , De Forest felt " crowded " in radio . " A hundred engineers were making a smooth and beaten road out of what had been a wild , fascinating trail . " De Forest , who had always hated and feared " the conflict with men and the hustle and clash of purposes , " sought a " new frontier " in talking pictures . He began with the old , consuming drive , toiling in his laboratory at High-bridge in the Bronx day and night , Sundays and holidays . But other afternoons went in reading the old diaries or in dreaming by the waterfall at Riverlure . His wife was having a baby and De Forest composed poems on this new life about to come into the world . There also were unpleasant distractions . The war business had dropped off , leaving the company in critical condition ; there was litigation with both the Marconi Company and over the feedback . Temperamentally more poet than engineer , De Forest was always incapable of forcing or disciplining his ideas . He would swoop down on a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing faculty for leaping difficulties . If the quarry snagged or proved elusive , however , he had to hop to something else . When escessity did compel him to work at something without respite , his nerves rebelled . " The jumpies , " De Forest called these attacks . His talking-movie experiments were proving balky and his mind hopped to other inventions . In 1907 a stray radio wire had fallen across his hand , slightly searing the flesh . Immediately his imagination had seized that wire in its beak and winged aloft in a dream of a new surgical aid . He had bought pounds of meat and had shredded it to bits , fascinated at how the radio currents cut through the flesh , yet sealed off the capillaries , stemming the bleeding . Calling in a doctor friend , they had tried it on a dog . In 1908 the Hospital St. Louis in Paris gave this " cold cautery , " as De Forest named it , a trial . Radio currents then were generated by none too reliable arcs . At a tragic moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from talking pictures , De Forest sought to perfect his cold cautery . For weeks his assistants cut liver until they sickened of the smell ; then De Forest gave it up . Today the " radio knife , " as it now is known , is an invaluable surgical tool , having replaced the scalpel in operations on the brain , for cancer , on bladders , for amputations or wherever bleeding may be profuse . By the time the knife was made practicable , On Forest 's 1907 patent had expired . He invented a portable radio telephone using a double vibrator and a six-volt battery . The New York Central tried it between the cab and caboose of one of its trains . When the railroad showed only lukewarm interest , De Forest dropped that too . Several years later the identical principle was utilized to discover the automobile radio . De Forest 's diary at this period reflects the wing flapping of a caged spirit . He berates himself for burying himself in " sordid detail and daily care . ... I have grown lazy . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , wringing out myself drop by drop upon paper . . . atrophied and died . I am not the man I was . " To rouse his energies to shake off the distractions , he sets deadlines for himself , and when he fails to meet them , the wings flap more desperately . Emulsion after emulsion , solution after solution  --  why does n't his mind leap all the difficulties with a short-cut inspiration ? " I plug on doggedly day after day , Sundays , Saturdays , holidays , on the film , on the film , " he complains in his diary . " I try to keep out of a rut . I believe I can win out , at least to the capitalization point . My soul is encrusted with toil , the mind cells are poisoned with this cursed zeal for work , to solve my problem and grasp the reward . " .. 11 Prisoner of Fortune " At least to the capitalization point " ? in this qualification we can see what being rich has done to De Forest . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds . Now , not only does he keep the bridges behind intact but he expects others to extend bridges to meet him . He is obsessed , of course , with the dread of losing this new fortune . Doubly the prisoner of his hungers , he wants to live in luxury , yet fears that he may waste his wealth and be plunged back into the poverty which each rereading of the old diaries makes more haunting , The clash between these fears and desires is reflected in alternate extravagances and penuries . He has four servants , a Rolls-Royce , and a small car " for the help , " yet eats in a greasy-spoon restaurant which his workers shun ? " to save time , " he explains . He spends thousands on an idea . yet , as former employees recall , furiously enforces little economies like switching off the furnace at the first trace of mild weather or turning off electric lights . Living far beyond his income  --  his expenses run $500 to $1000 a month above his $10 , - 000-a-year salary he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the market keeps " dropping , dropping every day . " In the summer of 1921 De Forest went to Germany to complete a deal to sell his patents in Europe . The cancer of inflation was in its " early stages . " Only a few weeks before , on July ninth , he had at last succeeded in getting his first talking picture , the sound directly on the film . He decided to complete his invention in Berlin . " Given an American income and a German outgo , " laboratory , skilled workers , materials would cost next to nothing . He would be rid of that " ever harrowing specter of debt . " Returning to New York , he turned over the management of his radio company to Keator and Charles Gilbert , the firm 's president . They were to try to sell the plant if they could . While operating it , they would split fifty-fifty with De Forest on profits . In October , 1921 , De Forest sailed again with his wife and daughter . He could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months later broadcasting boomed into popularity . As far back as 1908 De Forest had talked of wireless opera , news and even advertising going out on the air . By using four different waves , he had argued , " as many cleeses of music could be sent out . " He broadcast a speech on woman 's suffrage and , in 1910 , the singing of Caruso and Mme. Mazarin , the first such broadcasts in history . In 1915 , erecting a 125-foot tower on the roof of his Highbridge factory , he inaugurated " nightly concerts " ? a half hour of phonograph records . The following year he broadcast the Yale-Harvard football game ; on New Year 's Eve he staged the first " wireless dance " ; on election night he sent out bulletins for six hours , signing off at eleven P. as . with the proud announcement , " Charles Evans Hughes has been elected President . " When the wartime ban on amateur wireless was lifted late in 1919 , De Forest resumed his broadcasting . His station boomed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Forest had moved his transmitter to Manhattan without a permit , the Federal radio inspector revoked his license . Amateur interference with naval communications had to stop , the inspector told De Forest ; " There is no room in the ether for entertainment . " Undismayed , De Forest opened a station in the loft of the California Theater Building in San Francisco . For thirteen years he had pioneered in broadcasting and now , in the fall of 1921 , with broadcasting ripe to burst into life , he arranged to dispose of his factory and left for Europe . Berlin was a frustration . There was an acute housing shortage . De Forest had to bribe an official to find an apartment , only to be dispossessed by an unbrihed official . On arriving , De Forest , reasoning the mark could not drop any lower , bought several hundred thousand marks . The winter was miserable ; cold and damp ; fuel was scarce . There was a general strike . The Lap of Luxury He fled to the Riviera , where he met a casualty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent ch  --  teau near Monte Carlo , but no rubles . De Forest rented the ch  --  teau for 80,000 francs a year . In a letter to his brother he described the grounds as " a wonderland of semitropical plants and trees , bananas , palms , lemons , cacti , grapes , peaches , a fine big vegetable garden , a labyrinth of fine paths , and walls overhanging the sea . The house has about twenty-five rooms  --  I have n't counted them all  --  wonderful rugs , oil paintings , huge mirrors , pillars of Italian marble , balconies , sun parlors , a private tennis court , a private bathing beach . " With the ch  --  teau came an entourage of ten servants . The poor boy from Talladega indeed had risen in the world . But he could not still an uneasiness within him . Sometimes he felt that " all this seductive loveliness is a glorious Delilah robbing me of my strength . " A month of idleness was all he could stand . More than a year had passed and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the United States . Nor had he saved money . Late in August De Forest called American newspapermen in Berlin and demonstrated his " Phonofilm . " He was going home , and wanted to pave the way for a triumphal return . ( Continued from Page 42 ) He sailed on the Berengaria . De Forest likes to tell how , seeing the name of William Fox , the motion-picture producer , on the passenger list , he sent in his card , scribbling that he had invented a method of making talking pictures . Four years later Fox would be promoting Movietone News ; that day he would not even see De Forest . In New York , De Forest rented part of Norma Talmadge 's old studio on East 48th Street . He would really make talking movies now ; he had to , his fortune was dwindling so rapidly . He plunged into the task with all his nervous energies ; he was sound engineer , director , stage manager ; he developed his own films . Theodore W. Case began to work with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student at Yale in 1911 . After graduation , his millionaire father equipped a private laboratory for him , and there young Case , assisted by E. I. Sponable , developed the thalofide cell , more sensitive than the photoelectric cell De Forest was using . De Forest contracted for the exclusive use of Case 's cell , agreeing to pay one dollar a day per theater . Apart from this , there was no formal working agreement between them . They exchanged ideas freely , and in the system of Phonofilm that finally was developed it is difficult for a reporter to separate the contributions of one from those of the other . Radio was booming and De Forest got the chance to sell his company to a group headed by Edward Jewett , of Jewett-Paige Motors . Of the nearly $1,000,000 purchase price , De Forest 's slice ran close to $600,000 . Disaster had been staved off . He was richer than ever . With what he now refers to as " my Fourth Fortune , " he lavishes more money in Riverlure , doubling the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 cubic yards of dirt to level the slope descending to the Hudson . On his expanded lawn he puts up fountains , circular stone seats , a row of seventy-five-dollar cypress trees , a Japanese garden . In April , 1923 , De Forest gave his first public showing of Phonofilm at the Rivoli Theater . By 1924 , with a studio staff of ten , he was filming two to three subjects a week , not all successfully . He and Case made the first talking newsreel , camera interviews with the three presidential candidates , Coolidge , Davis and La Follette . De Forest 's repertoire of what he called " vaudeville in celluloid " grew steadily , including such stars as Eddie Cantor , Ben Bernie , George Jessel , Gloria Swanson , and Weber and Fields . Some theaters began showing Phonofilm regularly , De Forest renting them the equipment . By the end of 1925 he had apparatus in thirty-four theaters . To the Hollywood producers whose backing he sought , however , Phonofilm remained a crude , impractical novelty . The Bubble Bursts De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a year or two and no great sums . With aix years and $185,000 of his money gone , he began to realize that " this time I have gambled with my life . " Afraid to continue risking his precious fortune , he sought outside financing . The banking house of Hayden , Stone &; Co. offered to take a 50 per cent interest , 110,000 shares , ap parently for $400,000 . They planned to consolidate the Case and De Forest patents and to bring in Pathe Movies on the production end . De Forest , suspicious , balked at losing control . He received another offer of $680,000 for only 80,000 shares from Jimmy Elliott , whose spectacular use of song meetings and cheerleaders in selling stock during the 20 's , earned him the sobriquet , " The Man Who Barnumized Business . " Elliott put no cash on the line , but pipe-dreamed visions of a stock-hungry public falling all over itself to invest in this " marvel of the ages . " De Forest 's first involvement with a stock speculator , Abraham White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . His second affair with stock promoters almost sent him to prison . Now De Forest rejected the Hayden , Stone offer and eagerly ducked his head for a third time . He and Case parted . The bubble burst quickly . A special Phonofilm had been made of President Coolidge for the Friars Club . Complaints began reaching Coolidge that stock salesmen were using the film to hint that he endorsed Phonofilm as a good investment . Coolidge ordered an investigation . Ebb Tide Meanwhile , Warner Brothers , taking a gambler 's last fling to stave off threatened collapse , had launched Vita-phone in alliance with Western Electric . By the summer of 1926 posters on Broadway advertised the first Vita-phone shorts . To De Forest the posters were " a shock , like a blow . " Then he consoled himself , " Vita-phone is too ambitious at the start . They are throwing millions to the wind and will , I believe , exhaust their financial backers long before they can make it pay profits . They are starting at the top , not at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest theaters . We believe this ca n't be done , should not be done . " Once De Forest could dream of world-wide wireless when able to send messages only seven miles . Now Vita-phone was " too ambitious . " Vitaphone followed with Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer . The six words spoken by Jolson were to the talkies what Marconi 's S was to wireless . Fate and the odds were stacked against De Forest . Fox , next in the field after Warner Brothers , bought Case 's system , almost identical with that of De Forest . Why Fox purchased one and not the other was just a flip of Fate 's coin . General Electric moved in through RCA . To insure a market for its equipment , RCA bought control of the Keith-Orpheum circuit of theaters . What chance had De Forest , the lone inventor , against such competitors ? He had fifty-three Phonofilm patents , pending or granted , some of which still are used . Ironically , the one basic invention vital for talking movies was the audion amplifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a variety of ways of making sound movies became possible . In 1923 Phonofilm was undoubtedly superior to any form of talkie being experimented with ; by 1929 it was like a tin horn competing against a saxophone . The inevitable collapse proceeds quickly . Mary De Forest gave birth to another child , the long-looked-for son , but the boy died after a few days and De Forest separated from his ( Continued from Page 46 ) wife . He managed to sell his Phonofilm to Max Schlesinger , who had extensive motion-picture holdings in South Africa , rescuing his $185,000 and getting a contracted salary of $25,000 for five years . But the great corporations staked off every choice bit of motion-picture timber . Soon little was left for De Forest and Schlesinger save to wander the scrub pines of litigation . The stock market crashed . De Forest sought refuge in California . His old radio company was paying him $300 a month for his name . De Forest started a factory on the Coast ; the old company sued to bar his using the De Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , De Forest had neither factory nor retainer . His $25,000-a-year Phonofilm salary was abruptly cut off ; he had borrowed so much to keep the margins on his stocks current that he was overdrawn . He took a fling at mechanical television and soon could project pictures , eight feet by ten , on a motion-picture screen . The bank holiday choked off his capital . When money was free again , cathode-beam discoveries had made mechanical television obsolete . It is 1933 . Nearly every home in the United States has a radio and the magnificence of the industry- is reflected in the completion of the Radio City Building with $500,000 in vacuum tubes . In Chicago , a flicker from the star Arcturus , caught on a photoelectric cell and amplified by a vacuum tube , opens the World 's Fair . Electronics magazine boasts , " It is an all-electronics exposition . " Vacuum tubes change the colors of the fountain waters , they operate the loud-speaking systems , they control countless exhibits . But in all the eighty-five miles of exhibits the name De Forest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible is broke and out of a job . He has stopped paying the taxes and interest on River-lure , and soon will lose that . In 1909 , when Nora Stanton Blatch was about to divorce him , the night they were to separate De Forest got his wife and child together in his Riverside Drive apartment . He wrote in his diary , ' It was the last time  --  and the first time  --  that my child had slept beneath my roof . At last one dream of my years has come true . Dreams do come true ! " Out of the fishes This strange faculty for escaping from despair never deserted De Forest . He arrived in California in time for the wedding of Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels , stars of the silent films . Miss Daniels was a distant cousin of De Forest . There was a beach party at her home . One guest , Marie Mosquini , coming late , thought she would take a dip in the ocean before joining the other guests . On the beach she met a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatted , swam a bit . Later , in the house , her hostess appeared with this " fine figure of a man " in tow . " Marie , " said Miss Daniels , " I want you to meet - " " No , no , " interrupted De Forest ; " I do n't want it ever said that we were introduced . " Alter a six weeks ' courtship , they were married secretly in Mexico in October , 1930 . Marie 's father was Italian , her mother French ; well-to-do immigrants who settled in California as ranch owners . When Marie was four , she was sent to Los Angeles to aconvent . Her schooling ended at fifteen , when she got a summer job with a doctor whose sideline was building and renting out movie-lot stages . One customer was Hal Roach , who took the doctor 's extremely pretty assistant along with the stage . Marie played in most of the Roach comedies with Harold Lloyd ; she was leading lady in the Will Rogers shorts . Sufficiently in love to work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie gave up her hopes for a career , friends , night clubs and parties . She took courses at U. C. L. A. , hunted up interests they could pursue together , like studying Spanish . De Forest loved the outdoors and they made a ritual of trips into the desert and mountains on horseback , by car , often roughing it . Climbing Back Marie learned to accommodate herself to De Forest 's turtlewise popping in and out of his dream world . She was always on hand when he wanted her ; when he withdrew into himself , she knitted or made his apologies . When tired of company , De Forest simply tells his guests to go home or retires abruptly to his study . Invited to speak before the Pasadena Shakespeare Society , of which Mrs. De Forest is a member , he told the astounded culturists , " This is the second time my wife has inveigled me out here . Now , ladies , do n't ask me again . " There were nerve-racking days , as when the son Marie bore died and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also were compensations . Being the wife of a genius meant that greatest of all securities  --  being a somebody . In 1933 she dismissed the servants and took over the household duties . She still does the cooking , although the dire days are past . In 1934 , with two friends , each investing $500 , De Forest opened a little shop and began producing diathermy machines . At the time short-wave therapy was still an experimental fancy . He wrote articles in medical journals , demonstrated before doctors . With no riches to burden it , his imagination seemed to soar free again with its old pioneering boldness . He blazed out new uses for diathermy on horses and cattle , in beauty masks . The diathermy business has grown so that , with retainers from two radio schools , the De Forests live comfortably . They own their home . Every evening after dinner they listen to Amos ' n ' Andy ; every morning for the past five years De Forest has had the same breakfast . It has to be fixed just so , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit exactly his cereal bowl  --  what 's left of the banana goes carefully into the refrigerator . Around the banana he sprinkles some bran , and over it he pours warm milk . De Forest has always been penurious in eating ; he likes ice cream on his pie for lunch , but begrudges the dime . Marie has a standing conspiracy with the restaurant where he eats to put the cream on the pie and not charge him , paying the restaurant later . More than making up for these skimped dimes , De Forest is a mark for panhandlers or house-to-house canvassers . Whatever the hard-luck tale , De Forest 's memory matches it , and he shells out . In a hundred little ways Marie daily tucks in the blanket of De Forest 's egoism . The blanket , fortunately , instead of being worn threadbare with the years , has grown more lustrous . As new uses for the vacuum tube come out of the laboratories , the greatness of De Forest 's invention grows . While he was fighting for the material spoils of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry , and honors he might have received were denied him . In recent years a great affection for him has sprung up in the radio world . In 1938 he was elected honorary president of the Veteran Wireless Operators ' Association . He now is generally referred to as the " father of broadcasting . " David Sarnoff , RCA 's president , has embraced him publicly . Probably the greatest thrills , at the recent world 's fairs in New York and San Francisco , a special Lee De Forest Day was celebrated . The walls of De Forest 's study are hung with tributes , medals , diplomas , honorary degrees from Yale and Syracuse , the scrolls of honor given him at the two fairs , photographs of occasions at which homage has been paid him . Working in his study , the old diaries in a near-by closet , he often thinks of the past , but it is with a sense of triumph , not bitterness . When he glances at the key to the city given him by San Francisco , he recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking down at him , heals the hurts of earlier , broken loves . In his desk lies a tourist map of the state of Alabama , claiming him as one of its greatest sons  --  the " rebs " of Talladega who had so persecuted and tormented him in childhood making capital of his greatness ! Safe Harbor In a poem he wrote his wife one Easter , De Forest said he felt " like one resurrected . " That is perhaps the best description of him today  --  his earthly sufferings redeemed in a blaze of immortal glory . The idea that people may think of him as a failure provokes him to stormy indignation . The material rewards of his invention may belong to others , but he feels the world he fathered all his . As he told a radio THE SATURDAY interviewer recently , " I ca n't count my blessings . " At sixty-eight he sees his career as an inventor far from done . He likes to boast that only a few months ago he was passed for a $5000 life-insurance policy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reads religiously keep him abreast of the field . Recently he wrote a book on television ; in May he patented a new television-camera tube . He has applied for a patent on a dirigible bomb and is working on other inventions , notably a foolproof airplane altimeter . The Blue Distances De Forest wants to make at least one more great invention before he dies . On their excursions into the country , he and Mrs. De Forest often look over sites for the new home they will build when that invention comes in . De Forest dreams of a house reared on a mountaintop , commanding a view of both the ocean and the valley in the interior . He has the name all picked out , The Blue Distances . Many of De Forest 's friends pity him . They think of the opportunities he has missed , the fortunes he has lost , the billions in industries his invention has made possible , and their imaginations grow faint at the thought of what he might have been . Yet , if everything had not gone magnificently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If he had not lost his fourth fortune , and , in failure , found new love and new dreams , would he be the happy vigorous man he is today ? I do n't know how this chronicle of frustration has affected you , the reader ; whether you too pity him as a " failure . " By ordinary rags-toriches standards , that may be . I think him magnificent and , perhaps , the luckiest man who ever lived .
