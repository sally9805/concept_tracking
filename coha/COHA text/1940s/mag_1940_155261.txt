Cuba 's sticky tropical heat hung heavily over Havana last week , wilted the neat white suits of solemn Pan-American Conference delegates , kindled explosive oaths in the voices of bustling foreign newsmen , sent little rivulets of perspiration streaming down the beaming faces of 5,000 convening Lions . But the vibrating activity of Havana rose with the temperature as the Conference week rolled on to completion . <P> By 9:45 every morning crowds of Latin-American delegates had already passed through the great sculptured doors of Cuba 's $20,000,000 Capitolio , stood chatting in the lobby at the head of the long flight of marble steps . Only dark patch in the sea of white was the conservative blue business suit draping the lank frame of U. S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull . A long file of big beflagged cars moved slowly through the surrounding palm-shaded park , bringing more conferees to the red-carpeted entrance . By 10 o'clock committees were already at work in secret session , hammering away at the 56 proposals presented for consideration . Along the colored marble corridors , decorated with gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesticulating , buttonholing passing representatives . <P> In the afternoon newsmen hustled to the delegations ' press conferences , heard reports on the morning 's progress . Ignored were the colorless , day-late official handouts prepared by Conference Press Chief Count Nicolas del Rivero , brother of Falangist Strong Man Jose Ignacio Rivero . Behind a desk in his eighth-floor Nacional Hotel office , Secretary Hull received U. S. correspondents , biting the plastic rim of his spectacles , answering questions until his growing hoarseness forced Press Chief Mike McDermott to call it a day . <P> In the patio below , Dr. Leopoldo Melo , head of the Argentine delegation , slouched in a wicker chair , gesturing with small , delicate hands to emphasize his soft-voiced Spanish sentences . Behind him as interpreter stood handsome , black-haired , flashing-eyed Luis Mariano Zuberbuhler , secretary of the delegation . No newcomer to Pan-American conferences , a stanch U. S. friend is scholarly Buenos Aires Lawyer Melo , onetime Radical Antiper-sonalista ( conservative ) Deputy &; Senator , onetime Minister of Interior . At the Panama meeting last autumn he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealed directly to President Roberto M. Ortiz , threatened to resign unless Argentina approved U. S. plans for a neutrality belt around the Americas . <P> By night Havana resumed its appearance of a gay vacation city . From six to nine the tiny Nacional bar was crowded with delegates of all nationalities , newsmen , wives and secretaries of the delegates . To the Florida , Zaragozana or Paris went the visitors to dine , then back to the Nacional for moonlight dancing or to any pack-jammed little Cuban cabaret . One night in Cathedral Square a Spanish dancing show celebrated , a day late , the 157th birthday of South America 's Hero No. 1 , Simon Bolivar . <P> Aims and Objectives . The U. S. had called the Conference with the hope of getting unanimous agreement of all 21 republics on these principal objectives : <P> 1 ) some form of mandate over European colonies in the Western Hemisphere ; <P> 2 ) control of fifth-column activities ;                    @
