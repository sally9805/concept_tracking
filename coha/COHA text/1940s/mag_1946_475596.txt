BY THE army mind , I suppose I mean that part of the brains within the military orbit that determines policies and directs power . As a West Point colonel said to me in Germany , " This citizen Army has a great deal higher I.Q. than the regular standing Army . What we are hoping for is a stable force with the old-time low average in intellect . That kind makes better soldiers . " I would not presume to try to write a thesis covering the United States Army psychology . I do n't know enough . I know that cotton men determine the quality of staple in a fivehundred-pound bale by examining a few ounces of sample . A year ago I was instructing GI 's in the university center that the War Department had set up in a big British camp near the village of Shrivenham , under the Berkshire Downs , in England . Like a majority of the instructors , I was a civilian in uniform , subject to army orders . Since I had been a soldier for two years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the army way was no novelty to me . While I was waiting in New York to ship , the idea was again enforced on me how the Army is like a mule . After it has learned a formula , the only way to get it to unlearn that formula is to knock it in the head . This was the middle of July 1945 , and thepapers were publishing the comings and goings of the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth and everybody in the world that had any interest in their sailings could learn about them . They were crossing the ocean with decks cleared of guns , with lights ablaze at night , and without the zigzagging that was constant during the submarine menace . But a highly self-satisfied army captain who processed us civilians in New York told us in a whisper , on the eve of our departure , that we were to sail on the Queen Elizabeth , that we were under no circumstances to tell anybody where , how , or when we were going . We could not learn , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Shrivenham , England , and at Biarritz , France , already widely advertised in newspapers ? for which we were bound . Only after we had arrived at these secret destinations could we learn the APO address and thus be reached by mail . The mumbo-jumbo gave me the fantods . MHE military put no restrictions on 1 teaching at either Shrivenham or Biarritz . The commandant , a brigadier general , was a pleasant gentleman , generous with his whiskey and genial with the staff . I gathered that he took more satisfaction in a piece of wood lattice work put up by German prisoners of war to screen off some garbage cans than he took in any other feature for which he was directly responsible connected with what came to be called pompously , by army orders , Shrivenham American University . Long after General Eisenhower lifted military censorship on the continent , the military at Shrivenham were attempting to censor all articles sent back to the States for publication . I and other men writing for newspapers and magazines paid no attention to the orders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function I attended at Shrivenham was a British Brains Trust that subjected itself to questions concerning Britain . Most of the questions were on politics . The Trust was loaded with Conservatives , but it had one very nimble-witted and vocal Member of Parliament from the Labor Party . The big hall was full of GI 's , and they were so in sympathy with the Laborite 's views that they got to cheering him before he made a statement as well as after it , That came close to ending the popularization of liberal ideas on the Shrivenham campus . The GI 's at Biarritz , so I learned , had a feast of critical talks and discussions . When the university center held its formal dosing exercises in December , the general 's favorite chaplain , a major , prayed God over the loud speaker to forgive the staff for liberties taken " in the name of academic freedom " and for conducting an educational program " wholly secular . " He was a strong friend of Franco 's . From Shrivenham I joined a lecture bureau the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was about Christmas time . The director of the bureau provided me with orders to go wherever I wanted to go , and I wandered around among the troops in Germany and Austria for between four and five months before coming home . In Germany , as in England , I belonged to the I &; E ( Information and Education ) Division , and had a chance to see something of that part of the Army supposed to he concerned with education beyond the manual of arms and command school courses on assembling motor cogs . NY army is generally a good deal like a very high percentage of the civilian nationals it represents in not having a consuming passion for ideas . It would not be correct to say that an army never fights for ideas ; when it fights , it always fights for some sort of idea . Armies have fought to extend liberties , against oppression ; but , in so far as I know history , no idea for emancipating the mind , for enlarging the conception of human rights , or for dignifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The armies that have advanced human rights against graspings for power and property on the part of either nations or special classes within nations have been popular , or citizen , armies ? not regular armies . Any revolution that has at any time in history made war on the side of the common man against the power of the privileged and restrictive few has come from non-military minds . Cromwell 's army was raised from ground far beyond the king 's barracks . The American Revolution 's dream of mankind 's inalienable rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness used a military man named George Washington as its instrument , but the instrument did not dream the dream . The American Revolution was made by Samuel Adams , Thomas Jefferson , and Tom Paine . The French Revolution to establish liberty , equality , and fraternity graduated into the hands of the ablest and most dangerous conqueror in modern history preceding Hitler , but Napoleon had nothing to do with the philosophy that generated the revolution . That philosophy has been kept alive in France not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petain was a fair representative of the army mind , in pure form , of all nationalities . This mind is devoted to two things : ( 1 ) to uniformity , absolute uniformity in all physical things ? when the shirt without blouse is worn , the tie shall be tucked inside it between the second and third buttons from the top ? and ( 2 ) to maintaining the status quo , unless making conquest . The army mind applies the physical to the mental . The application atrophies the instinct to be intellectually emancipated . About 1840 , the American Army rejected Colt 's revolver , the use of which by frontiersmen finally brought it to he the most effective of cavalry weapons . Later , it said that the telegraph would never be a military agent . Between the World Wars it liquidated Colonel Mitchell because he advocated air power . Sometimes a bold leader with power and imagination arises to force the Army to adopt new methods , machines , ways . That is nearly always in time of war when the Army is impregnated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , but no professional army holding power has ever favored the extension of liberties . To expect democracy to advance anywhere in Europe or Asia by Order of the Commanding General is as idle as to fancy that a Jefferson or an Emerson might be nourished by the West Point atmosphere . The only good that an army can ever do democracy is as an instrument . It never thinks intimately , energetically , longingly of anything beyond the means of asserting its own power . To the Army in Germany , " denazifying " means essentially nothing more than the physical displacement of persons known to have belonged to the Nazi party . Denazifying has meant taking such a person out of his position , political , industrial , or otherwise , and either putting him in a concentration camp or turning him loose on society , perhaps to pick up rubbish , certainly to be a more disturbing element than he was while holding a paying job . Denazification , according to military conceptions , does not consist of putting anything into the head . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this assertion , pointing to newspapers , schools , and elections it has sponsored . There are many intelligent , liberal-minded , able men in the Military Government , not all of them civilians . In the end , they are all subject to the War Department 's point of view . I will maintain that the Army is at home with and movingly concerned with only the physical . It has no affinity for ideas . Even the Nazi philosophy it judges by the visible brand . Was this man a party member ? It does not concern itself with the life that the brand represents . If one can imagine how democratic the United States of America would become ifits own Army had in all its wisdom absolutely unlimited control , arbitrarily exercised , over the entire economic life , the whole educational system , and what would be left of the political affairs of the nation , then one may get an idea of how Germany is proceeding towards democracy under army control . I SPENT a day in a PW camp near flat-tencdd Darmstadt . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , after they had been screened . Tens of thousands of men have been held and released at this place . At the time I visited it , it had its own hospital under German medical officers . Among the prisoner patients , I talked with several professional men , some business men , some laborers , most of them towards middle age . T noticed that many had a book or two beside their beds . Without exception the books I examined were novels . Alexander Dumas ' The Three Musketeers , in translation , seemed to be the favorite . A censor can always admit an old romance without fear of ideas . The American Military Government , however , has banned Spengler 's Decline of the West and other books from German circulation . Personally , I think that forbidding any book i.o any civilian is a mistake . Censorship except for military security is a curse . The hospital library also served thousands of soldiers in the camp . It consisted of a few dozen paper-bound novels and short stories . Added to it a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred books in English sent by the Swedish Red Cross . These books , drawn from both America and Britain , contained Zane Grey 's Riders of the Purple Sage , Lamb and His Circle , treatises on radio , motor engines , etc . Several of the hospital prisoners said they wanted " something serious " to read ? biography , history , philosophy . Their conquerors had not provided them with a single paragraph expressive of the democratic way of life towards which we are supposed to be educating them , Twice a week the camp received copies of a semiweekly newspaper . No magazine passed through the gates . Here in this large camp tens of thousands of German men spent long periods of time , largely idle , awaiting transference to civilian life . Many of them were fallow for ideas . The Army has never felt the paper shortage . It has never felt cramped for priorities on printing . Suppose it had ordered printed , in translation , for free distribution ? or even for sale in marks ? millions of copies of twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women have worked , thought , played , and lived decently in a democratic country . I am not thinking of a library of didactical works , although I would include Emerson 's Essays and the mockeries of Voltaire . The Germans need , more even than Americans , to develop a taste for satire on themselves . I would include Whitman and Shelley . What I am thinking of primarily is biographies of democratic examples like Jefferson , Franklin , Jane Addams , the Adams Family , Tom Paine , Carl Schurz . That the Army did not adopt this method in its very big business of denazifying the Germans is excusable . That it did not and does not give means and authority to the kind of people who understand such matters is a commentary on its limitations in the world of ideas . E MPHATICALLY , iteratedly , and elabo-rately , the army has congratulated itself to itself and to the general public on its education program . My official business in Germany was always with I &; E ( Information and Education ) officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aware of realities beyond the physical . Generally , I wondered ? in private ? how they came to be picked for their jobs . Often I recalled the old story of the backwoodsman who advertised a coon dog for sale . A prospective purchaser pressed for details on the dog 's ability after coons . " Well , I 'll tell you , " the backwoodsman finally said , " this dog ai n't no ' count for nothing else , and I figgered he must be a good coon dog ! ' The average commanding officer in obeying an order to appoint an I &; E officer , the man responsible for the education of the unit 's troops , usually appointed the officer that he could most easily and gladly dispense with from other duties . He picked him out on the same principle that he would cull out an officer to send to another outfit if so ordered . I am not forgetting aregular army lieutenant that I met in Berlin with one of the livest minds one could hope to be sharpened by . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular Army who saw to it that his men had chances at all sorts of enlightening literature and discussions . When he revealed his eager , liberal mind , I understood why he had not been promoted to a general . Such stand out as exceptions in contrast to I &; E officers who were efficient only in filling out forms , in making money on black market operations , in doing nothing beyond the letter of the law . At Linz in Austria a very good I &; E officer informed me that a lieutenant general desired to see me . A request from a general is an order . As I learned when I was ushered into his office , one of his aides had told him that I represented the Inspector General . For a minute , the general was really courting me until I told him that my business was to make soldiers think . All of his interest immediately subsided . Another general gave me a lecture on how soldiers were deriving insubordinate ideas through I &; E activities . This was not long after soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congressmen , and otherwise made a lob of noise about not getting sent home more expeditiously . In the minds of regular army officers " theirs not to reason why " is still the military ideal . The Army is interested only in what it can be arbitrary about . Towards all else it is indifferent . With a single exception , neither officially nor personally , did any ranking officer responsible for the I &; E program as carried on by the lecture bureau ever show to me , either directly or indirectly , the slightest interest in ' ' the study and the communication of principles . " The exception was a major ( a civilian in uniform from Princeton University ) . When I got ready to leave the lecture bureau , I went upstairs to ask for a word that might expedite the senseless and inefficient delay of my orders . The lieutenant colonel looked me over in a bored way and asked , " Are you an American citizen ? " He had as much interest in my work as he had in anybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . Man after man who went into this program with interest and enthusia.J.iii had his spirit doused by the administratio:I . However , most teachers in American inKitutions of learning , either high or low , must become calloused to executives who comprehend the machine much better than they comprehend its purposes . N THE summer of 1945 there were more I than fifty weekly newspapers being published by separate army commands in the American zone of Germany . It was ? as I suppose it still is ? the function of I &; E officers to get these papers out . With few exceptions , the papers were as vapid as a chain store 's weekly sheet : This was not the fault of the GI 's who ran them , nor , often , the fault of the I &; E executives . The commanding officers distrusted any discussion of realities . The week I was at headquarters of a certain division in Austria , its paper , an outstanding one , carried an editorial culminating in this passage : " One reason why many GI 's look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Germans is because the civilians peddle the same kind of gripes and unfounded rumors that the Germans themselves spew . . . . While France can look back on centuries of fighting fur liberty , equality , and fraternity , Austria can recall only the regal pomp of its former aristocracy . " It was a long and able editorial . I heard the enlisted man who wrote it get a dressing down from a major . Only the civilian element in the Army has kept the Army 's daily Stars and Stripes at all realistic and vital . And all the way along , this civilian element has had to fight high-up instinct to throttle any critical approach towards affairs . One of the best newspapers in the English language is the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune . It is good because it is directed by intelligence and seeks enlightenment . Until along in 1945 , it was very difficult to get a copy of this newspaper anywhere in Germany unless one happened to be close to some high-ranking officer . Nowhere near a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , crave intelligence and enlightenment , but the minority in this world who respect intelligence and seek enlightenment are the ones who keepit from going back to cave-dwelling barbarism . One would imagine that amid the great dearth of newspapers and other sources of information , the high command of the ETO would have seen that those men and women in Germany eager for enlightenment had a chance to get the Paris newspaper . In time it became more available . No American civilian or military man or woman in Germany can eat , sleep , ride , buy a handkerchief , send a letter , or read a newspaper except by provision of the Army . I do n't know how the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune became available in cities like Bremen , Munich , and Frankfurt , but I would be willing to gamble that it was not through military initiative . When I arrived in Nuremberg , the trials had been in progress many months . I somehow got the impression that more brains were concentrated around the trials than anywhere else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peripheral contacts with the Military Government in Frankfurt and in Berlin , I did not gain impressions of brain activity as I gained from equally peripheral contacts with this court , sustained by the military but beyond it . The press of the world had headquarters in the Faber Castle outside Nuremberg , and here one could any night experience ferment of minds . In a very long and wide library room , I found current copies of the Figaro and other French papers , six or eight London papers ranging from the Daily Worker to the Times , a Russian paper , and miscellaneous reading matter . The American contribution to current reading matter , through the U. S. Army , consisted of a stack of the latest issue of Overseas Comics . Of course , there were some copies of Reader 's Digest . The military dominators of the world have administered many forms of opiates . Augustus Caesar was strong on gladiatorial spectacles ; the U. S. Army should make a comic strip its symbol ? and its coadjutor , the American Red Cross , should fly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1945 the Army decided to go on a splurge and make a few copies of magazines that appeal to the intellect available in the ETO . When I left , I &; E headquarters was distributing one hundred packets monthly , each packet containing Harper 's , the Atlantic , the New Republic , Foreign Affairs , the Nation , and a few other'rnagazines . One hundred kits for hundreds of thousands of men in many hundreds of commands scattered from the Danube to the Seine . The situation may have changed markedly since then ; I am told , for example , that twenty thousand copies of Harper 's are now distributed overseas each month by the Army . But at a time when the Army could get all the billions from Congress on all the projects for military " security " that it could think up , why should it so long have limited expenses to a mere one hundred kits of first-class magazines ? Simply because it did not set a value on first-class minds operating on any other than physical themes . The doodads for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first-class magazines distributed during a whole year in the ETO . Not that the Army is chiriche on anything . The Army does not change its procedure any more than , since Chaucer 's Sergeant of the Lawe was born into immortality , lawyers have changed their way of reasoning according to the judgments that " from the tyme of king William were falle . " In World War I , I saw the Army burn up good lumber at Camp Jackson , South Carolina , so as to clear the ground and the books . At an airfield in Bavaria a few months ago I saw high octane gasoline being evaporated because the outfit had no more storage space and no planes in condition to burn it . The supply system was working . Why change requisition forms ? The Army has had money to burn on the education program , and has burned it . " The gift without the giver is bare . " The best local paper I met on the continent was the British Morning News in Vienna , edited with a sense of values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talk with a general in the American Army 's headquarters in Vienna , I asked him why we could not throw in with the British and make this excellent paper with its enlightening features available to American soldiers as well as the British . He shared my respect for the British Morning , Kws ? really more able than the Stars and Stripes was at that time . He said he had thought about an Allied newspaper , but " it could n't be accomplished . " From the beginning the British Army had in ABCA ( Army Bureau of Current Affairs ) a far more intelligent program for soldier education than the American Army had . This opinion was held by all Americans who had any knowledge of the two systems . In the first place , when our Army began its orientation program , it ruled politics and economics out of the field as being " too controversial . " Not until late in 1943 , or perhaps along in 1944 , did soldier comprehension of current affairs appear to be desired by the high command . PTAHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American mind , but the Army had a chance to be realistic in a way contrary to the way of newspapers , radio , and Hollywood . I shall never forget an experience I had near Cambridge , where / was Visiting Lecturer of American History in 1944 . It was a Sunday some weeks after D-Day . I walked up the River Cam to the Red Lion in Grantchester . One could always get beer there , sometimes whiskey , and certainly a chair in the cozy old parlor . But this was a fine day , and a tot of other people had had the idea of walking to Crantchester . I sat down in the last vacant chair . It was beside an RAF sergeant , from Kenya . He was arguing with an American sergeant standing across the table over the merits of General Montgomery . The RAF sergeant did not like him ; the American was defending him on the ground that Montgomery believed in saving men while spending ammunition . Both had been drinking a good deal . The American sergeant said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now , " he said , " I want you to justify America 's being in the war against Germany . " By now the RAF exponent was too far gone to justify even malt . Irish looked around in triumph . There were two other American soldiers in the room , a private standing behind the sergeant and a lieutenant sitting with a likely-Iooking English girl over against the wall . Nobody said anything . Everybody had been listening to the argument . I could not hold myself in . " Sergeant , " I said to my fellow-countryman , " disregarding all ideas of right and wrong and sticking to nothing but technical facts , you certainly must know that four days after Pearl Harbor Germany declared war on the United States and we had to fight her whether we wanted to or not . " " No , " he said , " we declared war on Germany first . We forced her into it . " I appealed to the soldier standing behind the sergeant . " I think the sergeant is right , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted me when I came in . He smiled a smile that would have made a good advertisement for some dental concoction . " I just do n't know , " he said , and it was evident that he did not care . These three soldiers of a single kind happened to be concentrated that day , but they could hardly have come together thus out of an army commanded at the top by officers strongly and actively concerned with informed minds . In contrast to them , I had a class of eighteen enlisted soldiers from nineteen to twenty-nine years old , in Freshman English at the Shriven-ham university center , who composed the most aware , most eager , and active-minded group I have ever taught . They wrote essays on the United Nations , on race prejudice , current politics in England and America , and numerous other subjects that responsible minds concern themselves with . I used to read one or two of their papers every day and then merely act as chairman of the fervid discussion . The individuals in the class considered their interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but despite , the Army . As a lecturer to troops in Germany and Austria , I sometimes talked to formations of soldiers , present for an hour under orders ; with them I did all the talking while they sat " like buckets to be poured into . " Whatever success / had was at Red Cross clubs , where men interested in learning and thinking came voluntarily . I filled my dates at some Red Cross clubs where the program director had no more conception of free intellectual enterprise than the hole of one of her doughnuts had . At otherclubs I met coteries of soldiers who kept me on my toes till midnight . Whatever hope 1 have for the enlightened direction of America is founded on the questioning , learning , active minds of men who put on uniforms and became good soldiers ? also , of course , good marines and sailors ? without becoming army-minded . T is very difficult for anybody outside of I the President 's cabinet these days ? and no doubt for several individuals within the cabinet to tell whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was General MacArthur alone responsible for placing a man who represented the Spanish feudal tradition at the head of the Philippine government and arming him to crush out all liberal resistance in those islands ? Is it the Army or the state that has turned the educational system of Bavaria back to the Catholic party ? which never had any intimations of democracy and which is unlikely even to try to co-operate with Russia ? Is it the Army or the state that has dictated a policy toward China that at times has seemed to have no other object than opposing Russia , without regard for the struggling , chaotic elements of democracy in that chaotic land ? Was the proposed flight of B-29 's around the world the army idea of demonstrating the American government 's pacific intentions ? America was once regarded as the hope of oppressed minorities anywhere on earth . Today few oppressed minorities in any part of the world receive encouragement from America . Before Germany surrendered and for months afterwards it was common talk that the government of Germany in the American zone would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained as a police force . One or two dates were set , by insiders at least , for the transfer . All speculation on such a transfer has ceased . Not even during the Reconstruction period in the South following the Civil War has the American Army in time of peace ever before so had its own way . There remain only five things to do with the Germans : kill them off , educate them , keep them permanently impotent , turn them loose to be their old selves , or build them up to fight Russia . We decided a good while agn not to kill them off . We ca n't turn them loose . Keeping them permanently impotent would be a permanent expense . We have turned over educating them to the Army . It becomes increasingly clear that the Army 's conception of educating them is to fashion them into allies against Russia . That 's what the Germans want . The army mind is in the saddle . General " Blood and Guts " Patton was boldly expressing the army mind when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and the way of the Democratic and Republican parties . Admiral " Bull " Halsey commanding the Mediterranean fleet was expressing the army mind ? with which the navy mind coincides ? when he said , much later , " We 'll go anywhere we please . " This simply meant thathe would take the American flag with him , assured of the government 's backing . The army mind is in the saddle . When I got ready to leave Germany , it took me about two weeks to get orders that any efficient drug store could have routed out in a few hours . The whole trouble seemed to lie in a redundance of personnel ? not any shortage . Once my papers were lost ; twice the orders were incorrectly " cut . " On the last day while I was standing to heel in an office waiting for a colonel to sign the final correction , I overheard him and two other officers discussing a way to get around the table of organization so as to retain more men than the I &; E Division at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men they had , except to keep themselves in rank , I was not with the Army long enough to find out .
