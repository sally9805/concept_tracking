The busiest man in New York 's granite State Capitol last week was its boss , Governor Thomas E. Dewey . In eight months , he had come back from darkest political limbo to glisten again in the Republican constellation . In the last 30 days alone , Tom Dewey had studied , signed or vetoed a record 1,065 bills-some of striking importance . <P> In three years as Governor , he had : <P> Built up New York 's cash surplus to a staggering $500 million-the greatest ever accumulated by any state . <P> Cut state income taxes 50% , and reduced business taxes . Total cut : $122 million . <P> Furnished temporary housing for 1,500 veterans and their families . ( Seven thousand more temporary units and 22,900 permanent family units are in the works . ) <P> Expanded New York 's educational facilities by establishing a School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University and sponsoring establishment of a new junior college for veterans , to be known tentatively as Dewey College . <P> Signed and plugged for New York 's anti-discrimination law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus to improve the state 's highways , canals and mental hospitals by year 's end . <P> He had also found a new urge to keep himself in the public eye . He had welcomed the U.N . to Hunter College , paid tribute to Cardinal Francis J. Spellman on his return from Rome , spoken at a dinner honoring Winston Churchill , opened the season for the New York Giants by tossing out the first ball , been guest of honor at the Washington correspondents ' Gridiron Dinner , taken his family to the circus at Madison Square Garden ( see cut ) , and averaged some three speeches a week in Albany . <P> Last week , as Tom Dewey looked forward to his first week 's vacation in 17 months and to his campaign for re-election in November , no shrewd political dopester counted him out of the 1948 Presidential race .
