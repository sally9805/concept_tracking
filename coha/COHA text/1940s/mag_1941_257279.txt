Last week the U. S. Marine Corps released a report on the Garand rifle . Because the Marines know a lot about small arms , and had just adopted the Garand , the report was authoritative and timely . It was also : <P> &gt; The only official , fully documented account of Garand performance ever published . <P> &gt;A grave indictment of the Garand 's dependability . <P> The Test . Until lately , the Marines ' standard rifle was the 38-year-old war-tested Springfield , which was also the Army 's rifle until 1936. * Since the Army adopted the Garand , the Marine Corps has been under pressure to do the same . <P> Although the Marines are part of the Navy , they get their small arms from the War Department , and wartime supply problems would be simplified if both services used the same rifle . Last winter the Marine Corps decided to have the rifle matter out once &; for all . A board was appointed to test the bolt-action Springfield and three semi-automatic rifles ( Garand , Winchester , Johnson ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William W. Ashurst , a crack rifleman , and Lieut . Colonel Merritt A. Edson , who had earned Marine Corps fame in Nicaragua , hunting down Sandinistas . The Winchester , barely out of the laboratory , was never in the running . The much-publicized Johnson did better than the Winchester , did not equal the Garand in over-all performance . <P> For practical purposes the tryout resolved into a contest between 1 ) the Garand and the Springfield , and 2 ) the different systems of combat fire which each represented . The old-fashioned Springfield puts down a sure but comparatively slow fire ( 12-15 aimed shots a minute , for an average rifleman ) , is therefore the darling of those who believe with Colonel William Prescott of Bunker Hill ( " Do n't fire until you see the white of their eyes " ) in deliberate , sharpshooting marksmanship . The Garand is three to three-and-a-half times faster , is therefore the logical choice of those who put high fire power above all else . <P> But , said the Marine board : " Two things stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps ; one is ' dependability , ' and the other ' volume of fire . ' Bearing in mind the amphibious missions in the Marine Corps , the board places dependability first . . . . " <P> After boiling down results of all the tests for accuracy , ruggedness , general fitness for combat , the board rated the rifles : 1 ) Springfield ; 2 ) Garand ; 3 ) Johnson ; 4 ) Winchester . Best that the board could say for the Garand was that it was " superior to the other semi-automatic rifles . . . " ; " superior in the number of well-aimed shots that can be fired per minute " ; could be quickly cleaned in the field . Sum &; substance of the findings was that the Garand was a fair-weather rifle , excellent on the practice range but far from good enough for the Marines when the going got tough . The going in the test was very tough . Examples : <P> &gt; The rifles were doused in mud " of light consistency . " Results : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt became harder to operate as the test progressed . . . . The M-I Garand rifles would not function and the longer an attempt was made to operate the bolt by hand the harder it became to open . "
