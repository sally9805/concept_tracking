txt Andrei A. Gromyko , Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister , warned the United Nations Commission for Conventional Armaments today that the rejection of ' Soviet efforts to place atomic I questions on its agenda meant " theo collapse " of disarmament efforts . He made the statement after the commission , which is trying to carry out the disarmament resolution adopted by the General Assembly last December , had accepted a United States proposal I for a plan of work , or list of subjects to be taken up . He added that the commission 's ' rejection of the Soviet plan of work carried " all the consequences . " Mr. Gromyko declined to give a direct answer tonight to newspaper men who asked whether he meant to boycott the commission 's future meetings . He had given his statement in Russian , and he said that the Russian word " sryv " expressed his intentions exactly . Translation Not Challenged According to linguists consulted tonight , " sryv " means " collapse , " I or at least the circumstances producing a collapse , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations interpreter , although he is quick to do so whenever he feels ' that his statements have not been correctly translated . Apart from the possibility that he may boycott future meetings of the commission , Mr. Gromyko has the right to veto its plan of work when it is presented to the Security Council . In any event , owing to the present international climate , and in particular to the fact that the United States and Great Britain already have served notice that they will agree to disarmament only after an international police force is established , no prospect whatever is seen of the commission 's accomplishing any useful function . Its establishment resulted from the adoption of the General Assembly disarmament resolution on Dec. 14 , but it was not until February that the Security Council got around to setting up the com // mission , and it did not hold its first meeting until March . It had until the middle of May to submit preliminary disarmament , proposals to the Council , but only today did it manage to agree upon a plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the commission can even begin its task . By-Passing Move Revived ? After failing to agree on its methods of procedure , the commission asked the representatives of the five great powers to agree among themselves . They finally submitted two separate proposals , the United States plan , which was accepted by Britain , France and China , and the Soviet plan , which apparently revived the long-standing Russian attempt to by-pass the Atomic Energy Commission and have the question of international atomic control taken over by the Commission on Conventional Armaments . The new commission was barred by the Security Council from taking up the weapons within the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission  --  including other weapons of mass destruction , although the term never has been defined . However , the first paragraph of the Soviet plan of work stated that the Disarmament Commission should take into account the prohibition of atomic and other weapons of mass destruction in fixing the size of the armed forces authorized for each country . The vote on the Russian plan of work , which was supported only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the United State plan had been adopted by a vote of 8 to 1 , with the Soviet Union opposed and Colombia and Poland abstaining . First , however , the commission voted down a series of Polish amendments , beginning with one that , like the Soviet proposal , would have directed the commission in its disarmament work to take into account the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction . It stated that the control system to be established for disarmament should be " coordinated " with those for control of atomic energy . Importance Is Noted The importance that the Soviet Union attached to the amendment was indicated by Mr. Gromyko 's statement that if this were rejected he would . not support the other Polish amendments . However , it received only the Soviet and Polish votes , with Australia and Colombia abstaining . The four other Polish amendments then were rejected , with Mr. Gromyko abstaining . Dr. Oscar Lange , the Polish representative , stood alone on two of them , but another , which made only a drafting change , was supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined Dr. Lange on another . The United States , Britain and China were steadfast in voting down any change in the United States plan of work , which already had been revised several times . However , Col. W. R. Hodgson of Australia protested that he had voted for one of the Polish amendments because it appeared acceptable to him and he had no intimation from Ralph A. Bard , the United States representative , on reasons for rejecting it . TEXT OF U. S. PROPOSAL Following is the text of the United States proposal for a plan of work , as adopted today , providing that the United Nations Commission : ( 1 ) Consider and make recommendations to the Security Council concerning armaments and armed forces which fall within the jurisdiction of the Commission for Conventional Armaments . ( 2 ) Consideration and determination of general principles in connection with the regulation and reduction of armaments and armed forces , ( 3 ) Consideration of practical and effective safeguards by means of an international system of control operating through special organs ( and by other means ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( 4 ) Formulate practical proposals for the regulation and reduction of armaments and armed forces . ( 5 ) Extension of the principles and proposals set forth in Paragraphs 2 , 3 and 4 above to states which are not members of the United Nations . ( 6 ) Submission of a report or reports to the Security Council including , if possible , a draft convention . It is proposed that under the . six headings listed above all of the references by the various delegations suggested for the plan of work will be considered . It is also understood that this plan of work does not limit the freedom of individual delegations to make additional suggestions at a later time . As the United States working plan is so broad as to constitute apparently no guidance for the commission , and gives a specific pledge that any member may bring up additional subjects , the United States and Britain opposed also a French amendment providing that the commission consider armament production as well as armaments . This received three votes , those of France , Poland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rules of procedure . It was opposed by Britain , Australia , the United States , the Soviet Union , and the four other members abstained . After adoption of the United States plan of work , the Colombian representative , Dr. Alberto Gonzalez Fernandez , explained that he had abstained on all the votes because he felt that unanimity was necessary , and the statements by Mr. Gromyko had made it plain that there would not be unanimity . Emphasizing his disapproval of the proceedings , Mr. Gromyko then called for separate votes on the ten paragraphs in the proposed Soviet working plan . After the first vote was taken , the ruling of the Brazilian chairman , Dr. Joao Carlos Muniz , accepting , this procedure , was challenged by several delegates , who argued that adoption of the United States plan of work involved the rejecti &; of the Soviet plan . Dr. Muniz , however , pointed out that this was authorized by the rules of procedure in the absence of objections before the vote began . He overruled , however , Mr. Gromyko 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . If Mr. Gromyko 's intention was to show that other countries opposed the Soviet plan , his tactics were justified . The Soviet Union and Poland stood alone on all ten votes . Usually five to six votes were cast against them , although the number dropped to two on the final provision  --  corresponding to that in the United States plan ? that the commission work out a draft convention . After the ten votes came Mr. Gromyko 's statement on the " collapse " of disarmament efforts . The Belgian representative , Fernand van Langenhove , and the British representative , Sir Alexander Cadogan , then pointed out that the General Assembly resolution had mentioned both the abolition of atomic weapons and general disarmament , but had left them to the respective agencies . Sir Alexander noted that the membership of the two commissions was virtually identical and that there would naturally be " liaison , " but Mr. Gromyko gave no sign as to whether he would heed their appeals .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
