In Atlantic City , addressing the American Society of Mechanical Engineers , AEC Chairman David Lilienthal also took note of the fifth atomic year . " If this country really means business , " he said , the $2 billion investment in atomic development would have to be doubled within the next few years . The U.S. would also have to get over its bugaboo about secrecy . Said Lilienthal : <P> " Secrecy , applied in a stupid and hysterical and demagogic way , can actually impair and weaken our security . . . . We need ideas if we are to keep our lead and increase it . . . . New ideas require not only inspiration and perspiration but information . . . . It would be nothing short of a major national catastrophe if through lack of an informed public opinion America 's atomic enterprise should drift into the doldrums , should fall prey to ignorance or panic or indifference or petty politics .
