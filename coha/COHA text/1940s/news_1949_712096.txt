txt By a resounding voice vote , the House passed and sent to the Senate today a bill liberalizing the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 so that 339 , - 000 victims of Nazi or Communist oppression might find a permanent haven in this country . Restrictive requirements and priorities of the present law , limiting admission to 205,000 persons , also would be removed by the measure that swept through the House in a little more than three hours . These restrictions , imposed by the Senate in the Republican-controlled Eightieth Congress , made the treatment of displaced persons by this country one of the major issues in the November election . President Truman and Governor Dewey , his Republican opponent , denounced the act , but Republican members of Congress . for the most part , had to defend it . As the House voted this compromise with President Truman 's request for the admission of 400 , - 000 displaced persons , the Senate approved spending $16,000,000 for the relief of Arab refugees in Palestine . The program would be administered through the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee had approved a $14,000,000 contribution by the United States . The extra $2,000,000 , asked by Mr. Truman , was added by the Senate on condition that other countries meet their commitments under the program . Among the arbitrary provisions removed under the House-approved bill would be the requirements that 30 per cent of those admitted be agricultural workers , and that another 40 per cent be of Baltic origin . The measure also changes the // HOUSE VOTES BILL TO EASE DP CURBS // deadline , or the so-called cutoff date , when refugees must have entered the European occupied zones or Italy to qualify for admission to this country . The present law sets Dec. 22 , 1945 , as the date , thereby making ineligible those who fled the Russian satellite areas . The new cut-off date is set as Jan. 1 , 1949 . Passage of the new bill , sponsored by Representative Emanuel Celler , Democrat , of New York , was obtained with a minimum of controversy . Debate was limited to two hours , during which the only frontal assault on the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas . He argued that the bill " rewards1 the least deserving , least desirable and most dangerous of all people who want to come to this country . " With other nations having had " the pick " of the displaced persons , he asserted , only " the dregs " could be found among the 500,000 still in the camps . He ' said that most of these 500 , - 000 " came to the camps eighteen months to two years after the shooting war was over simply because they could get 2,000 calories of food a day there instead of the 1,500 available outside . " He added that many of those in the camps " were planted so that they might infiltrate this country , " and that they were sent " with the connivance and assistance of those Red countries from which they allegedly fled . " Democrats and Republicans eagerly sought the floor to answer his charges , and the effectiveness of their answers could be judged best , perhaps , by the fact that the bill was adopted with only one major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis , Democrat , of Georgia , requiring that displaced persons on arrival in this country take a non-Communist oath , was adopted by an overwhelming voice vote . The displaced person further would be required to swear that he was not or ever had been a member of any organization or movement designated by the Attorney General as subversive . An amendment by Representative Joseph R. Bryson , Democrat , of South Carolina , cutting authorized admissions by 100,000 , was snowed under on a voice vote . Equally lopsided was the margin by which a motion to recommit the bill , offered by Representative John Jennings Jr. , Republican , of Tennessee , was rejected . The Celler bill , as passed , extends the law to July 1 , 1951,1 thereby adding a year to the program , and provides that those entering this country during the first year shall be counted as part of the 339,000 authorized admissions . Debate brought out that there were now in this country or on the way a total of 34,569 displaced persons . The liberalized law also would provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish army now resident in England ; 15,000 persons who may still escape from behind the Iron Curtain ; 4,000 refugees from communism who have been living in Shanghai , and 2,000 additional displaced orphans . Mortgaging of quotas up to 50 per cent is continued under the bill , and a new scheme is added whereby displaced persons who got out of Europe on their own and have found temporary refuge elsewhere may claim , for a five-year period , half of the mortgaged quota for their native land . Displaced persons who entered this country before April 30 , . 1949 , gutside of the regular program would receive two years to apply for permanent residence . This is an extension of a principle in the present law . Another new provision authorizes the use of 50 per cent of the German quota exclusively for persons of German ethnic origin who were born in Czechoslovakia , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Poland , Rumania , Russia or Yugoslavia who resided in Germany or Austria on Jan. 1 , 1949 . A loan of $5,000,000 is authorized for public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ports of debarkation to points in this country where they will take up permanent residence .
