Earnest , spectacled William McChesney Martin Jr. , 34 , who looks more like an apple-cheeked bumpkin than the $48,000-a-year president of the New York Stock Exchange , resigned his job , and last week joined the U.S. Army at $21 a month . Because willing service by the wealthy is good draft publicity , Manhattan 's Selective Service publicity used the occasion to set off plenty of red fire . Mr. Martin cooperated . With $30 in his wallet ( " I suppose I should n't have that much " ) , little more than a change of underwear in his zipper bag , he cheerfully suffered many an interview and photo . He also dramatized the leveling influence of the draft by sticking close to a contrasting fellow recruit : an awed $16-a-week Stock Exchange page boy . <P> Fire of another color fumed up last week in Washington . Ellison DuRant Smith Jr. , 26 , sprout of bag-eyed , walrusy Senator " Cotton Ed " of South Carolina , is clerk of the Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee , whose chairman is old Cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,900-a-year clerkship only eleven months , has been going to night classes at the National University Law School . When his draft number came up , he asked for deferment ( to Class 2A ) on the ground that he has a special employment status : he was indispensable to the Senate 's Agriculture and Forestry Committee . Local Draft Board No. 8 made his request public . <P> Young Cotton Ed 's request was backed by a letter , signed by twelve of the committee 's 20 members : " To remove a clerk with the experience and background that he must have . . . would greatly impair the effectiveness of the committee work and retard general progress in vital legislation . . . . It is the desire of the committee that Mr. Smith be deferred . " Signers included Isolationist Burt Wheeler , Nebraska 's liberal George Norris , half a dozen brother Senators of Senator Smith ( but not old Cotton Ed ) . Three of the signers ( like old Cotton Ed ) had voted against the Selective Service and Training Act ; four had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board 's reply to this imposing intercession was that young Mr. Smith could be deferred to July ( because he is a student ) but no longer . Trumpeted old Cotton Ed , wroth at all the publicity : " Character assassins . . . unprincipled individuals . . . unprecedented for a draft board to lend itself to a murderous assault . " <P> Meanwhile , reporters found that two other Senators had wangled deferments for relatives . Delaware 's New Dealer Tunnell got his 26-year-old son Robert on the deferred list because he was needed in the management of " eight or nine " of his father 's farms . Delaware 's James H. Hughes had got his 33-year-old nephew , Randolph Hughes , deferred because the Senator needs him for his secretary .
