 | ten or fifteen feet deep they would abandon it and try elsewhere . Sometimes they would give up altogether . " Oh , to hell with him ! If he do n't like it down there , let him dig out . " Often while they were digging , a man would break the crust almost at their feet and crawl out ; and then they would ask him questions . Where was his dugout or shack or tent down below ? Was he on C Street or D Street , or up the mountain or down ? How far was he and in what direction from the Crystal Saloon or Bill 's Faro Parlor or Nat 's Lodging House ? " By God , " cried a man suddenly , " where is Julia Bulette ? " Anxious men gathered and argued loudly about Julia . Where was her white cottage down below ? Even if a thousand men perished , Julia must be rescued ; and soon a hundred men were frantically spading to find a harlot 's house . Eilley was disgusted . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died under the snowslide  --  and all the thieves and gamblers and murderers with them . She caught Sandy by the arm and led him home . Strange was the philosophy with which men accepted the catastrophe . Nobody knew how many persons were entombed alive and few cared . They dug Julia out , and after that there seemed little to do . Now and then a lone man wandered about , searching for a friend ; but most of those who had emerged were intent on finding whisky . Eilley said they would make the best of it . Like others , she and Sandy enlarged the tunnel that led to their house and cut a chimney to let the smoke out . The smoke and fires below melted the snow above , and day by day the tunnels became larger , huts and dugouts were flooded , and water froze into mammoth icicles . Men spaded until they had cleared enough earth to set up tent saloons and gambling halls again . These were curious to look at after dark . Set down in depressions , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were sunken basins of light . How many men perished , nobody ever knew . Some who survived  | had been buried so deep that they were three days and nights digging out . For three days and nights men continued to emerge , cursing like hellhounds when at last they reached the surface , and calling loudly for whisky . Sandy reported the most important happenings to his wife . " All the whores , " he said on the second day , " has been dug out . " " Of course ! " said Eilley . " But they say there 's men they know about ai n't showed up yet . " " Mr. Bowers , there 's going to be famine here this winter . Do you realize that ? " " Yes , " said Sandy , who had never thought about it before . " You 'll have to dig down to our food supply and see if it 's all right . It might get wet . " Snow fell again , foot upon foot , for this winter of 1859-6o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Terrific winds swept over the city , piling huge drifts ; and then the temperature sank to thirty below zero . Eilley spent most of her time in bed , dreaming of her mansion , and waiting for spring . Starvation faced the town . The last flour had been sold at eighty dollars a bag and there was none now at any price . There were no beans , no salt bacon  --  nothing but whisky and the emaciated beasts out in the desert . Sandy spent his time gathering sagebrush for the fire or reporting the news . " They want someone to ride fer help , " he said one day ; and he added humbly : " But no man will . " " They'n drink whisky , " said Eilley , and thought of her hoard of flour and beans . " It 's whisky they freighted in last fall when it should have been flour . Let them eat that . " " One man , he said mebbe they 'll eat the Mexicans . " " Eat the Mexicans ! " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You better take some food down to Louisa and see if she 's all right . " Luff butchered his ox , but the creature was only hide and bones . He buried the carcass in snow by his shack and then killed the  | mule . Other men were slaughtering too , and carcasses were fetched in by hundreds and buried in the drifts . After all the live beasts had been slain , men searched the hills for those that had starved or frozen to death . Six bold men at last volunteered to seek aid and set out for Carson City , with the snow frozen like stone under them and the wind stinging like exploding gun powder ; but they all froze to death before they had gone six miles . Those in the town who died of hunger were buried in snowbanks to wait for spring . More snow fell and drifts piled higher until nothing could be seen but the limitless whiteness of earth and the friendless pallor of the sky ? nothing but those and the mirages overhead . There was never a flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Men saw wild ducks and geese and some of them shot all their ammunition away . Luff and his family lost flesh and began to take on the elemental aspect of starved things whose only thought is of food . Luff would sit and watch his daughter suck for an hour on a bone that was as bare of nourishment as a piece of marble ; or he watched Rebby make gravy of melted snow and a pinch of flour which she measured out as if it were gold dust . The huge butcher , Sam Brown , developed an uglier temper than ever before and plunged his knife into a half-dozen men . With the whole town starving , life and death seemed trivial matters . When Sandy went over town he pretended to be half-starved . Eilley told him to pretend that . " If they find out we have food they 'll just march in and take it . " Sandy wanted to give food to john Mackay and the McCoys , but Eilley said no . " Mr. Bowers , our unborn son is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food  --  but not until signs of spring are here . " Over town Sandy heard a man say : " Shall we eat the dogs or the Indians ? " Earnestly men argued the matter . One said a lean dog would taste better than a fat Indian , and others agreed ; but the miserable Paiutes were in no danger . Robbed of their pine nut orchards , they had fled , and were now far away and perhaps starving  | too . " They 're to hell and gone , " a man said , and stared at a shivering dog . Like others , he remembered that dogs had uncovered the dead men in snowbanks and eaten everything but the hair . " We 'll have to draw lots , " said another man , " except I think the fattest should be eat first . " " The Mexicans , we should eat them . " " The bodies in the snowbanks , " said a man who had not spoken , " what makes you think it was dogs ? " Another man laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumor of the threat to eat Mexicans ran through the town ; and desperately , like beasts caught in the same trap , they began to quarrel with one another . Like weaker animals skirting the edge of a feast while the more powerful ones fed and fattened , they spent their daylight time digging over the frozen hills for pine nuts ; but darkness herded them into the town and there they moved like watchful shadows . Knowing that famished men hungered for their flesh , they began to murder one another . In an evening late in February , under a full moon , a Mexican and a Chilean fought a duel . Men turned the fight into a carnival . After making a small arena , they terraced the wall of snow around it , spading and chopping and making an amphitheater so they could stand in rows and all have a clear view . The two gladiators were stripped to their waists , shirts were wrapped around their guard arms , and they were given identical knives with blades six inches long . All the roughnecks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout encouragement or contempt and lay wagers . " Now you two , " said a man , acting as master of ceremonies , " is to git in there and send each other up the flume ; and we do n't want no fancy stuff . Sock your knives in where you wo n't dull the edges and then push the handles out of sight . You two bastards ready ? " The warriors nodded . " All right , bury your knives ! " The Mexican , more alert , or possibly less drunk , than the other ,  | lost no time . He hopped forward like an enraged cock , feinted , and plunged for his opponent 's throat . He missed the throat but the blade opened a furrow from eyebrow to chin . The spectators vented a roar of approval . The Chilean , one eye blinded , and with blood in tiny reefs on his black beard , was twice as cautious as before . He hopped around with such alacrity that he seemed to have springs in his joints . Perhaps he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mexican , grinning evilly , moved with slow and calculated grace . Men were now betting on the outcome . Some were offering odds of ten to one on the Mexican , wagering silver ore and whisky . Close to the arena stood the redhaired and redbearded Goliath , Sam Brown , his huge mouth bawling insults . " You lousy hoppun rats ! " he bellowed . " You do n't know nothun about a knife ! You Chilliun , straddle it afore he trumps the other side of your face ! . . . Oh ! " cried Sam , and groaned horribly . " It aches my gizzard to see them good knives wasted .... " Other men were shouting advice to one or the other , depending on where their wagers lay ; and all the while the two duelists , prancing gingerly like embattled cocks that had been tripped by their own spurs , were trying to feint one another out of position . The second desperate move was made by the Chilean . After ducking and feinting in a series of lightning hops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stepped swiftly forward and buried his knife in the Mexican 's shoulder . It was a thrust delivered and withdrawn so quickly that for a moment the spectators did not know what had happened . But when they saw a geyser spout from the Mexican , they thundered their joy and reversed the odds . Wagers were now two to one on the Chilean . They rose to six to one when the Mexican , maddened by pain , red with his own gore , threw caution to the winds and leapt in , slashing wildly . In the next moment the two grasped one another 's knife arm at the wrist and then whirled round and round with the blades flashing in the moonlight . Sam Brown was laughing so hard that tears ran down and hung  | in bright drops on his red whiskers . Suddenly the Mexican broke free , leapt , and struck ; and the other side of the Chilean 's face was laid open from jaw to hair . It was an awful face to look at now ; but the one good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the main chance . The betting was now even . Both men were growing weak but the Mexican was more seriously wounded . His thrust was deep and blood still spurted . Perhaps he realized that he had to finish the fight quickly ; perhaps he was insane with rage . He again forced the fight , stepping in with his guard arm lowered ; and the burning black eye of the Chilean saw him come . In the next moment it was all over . The great throng went mad . The Mexican sank slowly , his knife falling from his grasp , his hands supporting him for a moment as he knelt ; and then he dropped and lay still . Luff and Sandy turned away . When Sandy reached his cabin , Eilley sat up in bed and demanded : " Mr. Bowers , what is all that hullabaloo over town ? " " Two men just fit a duel , " Sandy said . " Men are beasts , " said Eilley , and lay back against a sack of shavings that she used for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would not always be so . Before long , in ways to be devised , and after the strength and purpose of her heart , she would rule the town and shape its destiny . Some day  --  she hesitated a moment on the sudden flash of insight  --  some day she would be its queen !  | CHAPTER IX THE NOTION THAT SHE WOULD BE A QUEEN , COMING TO HER unexpectedly in one of those incandescent flashes of vision , so obsessed Eilley that for days she could think only of it and of her child . It was a daring thought . It was , indeed , so prodigally reckless that she kept it to herself . It was a wild and nervous alien that she fostered gently  --  as if by tiptoeing soundlessly to a mirage of water she could kneel and fill her cup . Or it was as if a strange bird had entered her house , where windows were open , and she had to move quietly lest the bird leave . But the birds out of the inscrutable night were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy secret , her meteoric thrust of vision into darkness , was hers to keep and cherish until certainty made it secure . Like all her prophetic divinations , this one became more plausible as she gave it more care . A trembling star on the far margin of consciousness , it came within the orbit of her destiny and grew until it was a golden sun ; until an intimation of light became the soul of light itself ; and its meaning , far away and lost until a window was opened , became an inseparable part of her . For that was the way with Eilley 's intuitive recognitions . Inexplicably , in odd moments , they came out of that depth of darkness beyond the reach of mind  --  as meteors burn a path to the mother planet and became a part of it . Her mind , her purpose and will , were made of such alien stuff beyond the realm of the five senses . Other men , other women , could build themselves of what they could touch and see ; but Eilley fed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would have said if she could have put the matter into words . She would have scorned logic , having no understanding of it , nor any heed . Her intuitions cut through the slow and ponderous mass of logic like a vein of lightning through a belt  | of fog . She gathered to herself in a few moments or a few hours the certainties , and the well-lighted path , that did not come to others after years of painstaking thought . Instead of trying , patiently and methodically , to build a lighthouse of her mind , she opened the window of her world to let in the infinite . After a week of psychic lightning she was so convinced that she would some day be a queen that she went over town to have another look at it . She liked nothing of what she saw . The dirty and emaciated men all seemed to be drunk  --  though Sandy , obediently at her side , said they staggered only because they were starved . Dozens of them , he said , had gone up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were signs of spring ; and while Eilley was gazing over the countless basins in the snowslide , she heard the tinkling bells of a freight caravan . A man rode into sight , leading a dozen mules , packed from ears to tails ; and out of tunnels , holes , and saloons poured the famished thousands . They almost knocked Eilley and Sandy down in their mad rush for flour . They ignored the mule-skinner and began to undress his beasts ; and while the man danced in fury and called them robbers and thieves , there rose a wail of consternation and vile cursing . On the first mule they had found only whisky ! The second beast drooped under two halfbarrels : was it pork , syrup , or pigs ' feet ? They jerked the barrels down  --  and discovered brandy . The third mule was loaded with five-gallon kegs . Was it butter or pickles ? It was gin . Down the line of beasts they went like men gone mad  --  but on the first ten mules there was only whisky , brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loads , burst keys and barrels open , and rolled them aside . Some of the men , weakened by starvation , were trampled underfoot by the powerful . Standing on an eminence to watch the scene , Eilley could see only a bedlam of struggling and howling forms like beasts in a mire ; but among them were giants , like Sam Brown , bellowing curses at the freighter and dragging the burdens off the last two mules . The last two were loaded with bar fixtures and glass ! Unable to believe that a freighter would break a trail and come  | to a starving camp with nothing but alcohol and glass , the multitude fell back impotent and speechless in their disappointment . In this moment of silence the mule-skinner made his voice heard . " You robbers and thieves ! " he shouted . " There 's another load will be here in a minute , and it 's flour ! " " Flour ! " a man roared , and a thousand voices took up the cry . " They sure are hungry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in his wife 's storehouse there was still food . " They 're nothing but beasts , " said Eilley , wondering how she could build a decent city of such men . A few minutes later , the second caravan came in . The enterprising owner stood in the panniers of his lead-mule , announcing that he would auction the flour off ; but even while he spoke , the mob closed in . They laid hold on the mules and almost dragged them down in their frenzy to get hands on flour . They tore bags open and filled their pockets and their dirty caps ; they broke away from the multitude with flour in their cupped hands ; and they staggered away to snowbanks to mix flour with snow and wolf it down . Soon there were hundreds of them kneeling and feeding on raw flour ; and the owner of the caravan was left with only torn and empty bags , broken pack-saddles ripped from the mules , and patches of spilled flour in the snow . By these patches the weaker men knelt and fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCoy shack , during the plundering of the freight , there had been violent argument . Rebby , too , had felt the coming of spring ; and she knew that this town would soon awaken and surge forward , that there would be millionaires almost overnight , and mansions on the hillside . " But you , " she howled at her fat husband , " will work for four dollars a day ! " " That 's good wages , " said Luff . " Yes , with flour eighty dollars a sack ! I tell you , Luff McCoy , I wo n't stay here and see other women wear silk ! I wo n't stick around to see the airs of Eilley Bowers ! If you ca n't find a mine , then why  | in hell do n't Nita marry a millionaire ? Is this Carter Craig , " she asked Nita , " a rich man ? " " I do n't know , " said Nita . She was sullen . She had lost so much flesh that she looked like a skeleton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gown Craig had given her was a soiled pile in a corner . " When you fatten up , you should ought to get a rich man . What you got them big black eyes for ? " " You mean I should ought to be a whore . " " I mean I wo n't eat beans while a woman like Eilley rides in a carriage . Besides , we soon got to move off of this ground . Then where 'll we live ? " " On another piece of ground , " said Luff . " I want to be rich ! " she cried desperately . " All my life I been dirt poor and I 'm sick and tired of it ! If Eilley can be rich , why ca n't I ? Ai n't I as smart as she is ? " " No , " said Nita . " Not half as smart . " " Rich people go crazy , " said Luff , unmoved by his wife 's tantrum . " Did n't they go right out of their minds down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That 's all you ever give me . I guess Eilley Bowers will go crazy ! " " It wo n't surprise me . " " Well , there 's billions right anunder this town . I want my share . Luff McCoy , I do n't think you got good sense . In Sacramento you could a-been rich but you went fishun ! " Rebby looked at her husband . He was still plump in spite of starvation , but she knew it was only whisky bloat . His surface was rounded but he was hollow and full of wind underneath . And little enough she cared . " Look at Sandy Bowers , " she said at last . " He do n't know enough to empty his own chamber pot , but he says Eilley is to make a gentleman of him . Every scrub and gelding and lame-jointed bastard here will be rich but us . " She considered a moment and added softly , ominously : " There 's men would appreciate a woman like me. "  | " I'n imagine it ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A woman has a right to be a lady and wear fine clothes . Even you , " she said , looking Nita over . " But I 'll have to go on using a hole in the mountain for a privy and Eilley 'll have six bathrooms in her house . She wo n't even speak to us then . Luff McCoy , you realize there 's people speaks now who wo n't much longer ? " " And what of that ? " said Luff . " I 've told you a thousand times I do n't want to be a millionaire . " " Just listen to the fool ! " scoffed Rebby . " So you do n't wan na be a millionaire ? As if you could ! But why do n't you want to ? Can you answer me that ? " " Well , if I was a millionaire , I 'd feel like the thief who inherited heaven and saw all the people leave it when he entered . " " What thief ? " asked Rebby , baffled and incredulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most irritating things about her husband . " The thief who found a mine . " " You crazy fool ! Well , to hell with you ! You'n be as poor as the wax in a dead man 's ears , but I intend to be rich . " In her rage Rebby was shaking all over . She went to the door and looked over to where a thousand men were eating raw flour . " Just think of it , " she muttered to herself . " Think of the chances lost . Just think what that town will soon be ! " Eilley was thinking of exactly that when she and Sandy returned to their cabin , and she continued to think of it . More clearly and sharply than Rebby , more clearly and sharply than any but a very few here , including the quiet John Mackay , she sensed that the stage was set for a tremendous drama ; and she was laying her plans . She would act swiftly when spring came  --  and spring soon came . April brought another horde lusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners and merchants , gamblers and saloonkeepers and adventurers , honest men and thieves . Up over the Sierras , across the valley , and up Gold Canyon they came afoot , on horse , by wagon and coach . Over in the Sierras men had set up  | sawmills , and early in April great caravans of lumber and logs moved in . Virginia Town now resounded with the clamor of saws and hammers , and the infernal racket of mule teams . Nearly every man in the place had sharpened his wits and was ready to seize both his opportunity and his competitors by the forelock . At least one man was prospering . In his square frame shack his price for a bed was prohibitive to many , but he charged only four-bits if a man wanted to sit up all night ; and if a man was willing to stand , Sandy said , he could hire a roof overhead for a quarter . Soon the furious energy of the town beat upon a person 's senses and overwhelmed him . The terrific din of it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself a city now  --  would be , everybody said , the greatest metropolis west of Chicago and the richest spot in the world . They would pave its streets with silver ; they would build mansions from the crown of Sun Mountain to the floor of Six-Mile Canyon . And Eilley listened and planned and waited for the right moment to lease her mine . Meanwhile , there were rumors of war . There was also a rumor that the Pony Express would soon come through . On April 12th , thousands of men , including Sandy and Luff , went to the mouth of the canyon to wait . The Pony Express did come ; and when the rider appeared on a lathered horse out of the gray east , the thousands went mad with joy . They tramped on their own hats , fired guns , danced jigs . In nine days the Express had covered the fifteen hundred miles from St. Joseph . That was a feat worthy of a conquering West . A fresh horse was led out , a mochila stamped Overland Pony Express was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost before the men could realize he had come . During the few moments while he tumbled off one horse and mounted another he spoke only once : " The nation is going to war ! " As soon as he had streaked out of sight , the men stopped their jigging and marched back to town . So the nation was going to war ? That was all right , but what in hell was the news of the coming fight in England between Sayers and Benecia Boy Heenan ? Heenan  | was their man . He had once mucked with them in California camps . Virginia City already had a Heenan bar , bootblacks gave Heenan strokes , barbers gave Heenan haircuts . The fight was set for April 16th . When , they demanded , would news of it reach here ? While they waited , news came that civil war was inevitable , that Seward would be the next President , that the Southern States would win . They said to hell with all that . What was Benecia Boy doing ? Then came a day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pony Express ; and out of the east streaked the hardest rider any man there had ever seen . He had been riding against time . And as he arrived he fell from his horse . " Did he win ? " men cried . " Benecia Boy , is he champion now ? " The rider was dazed by his fall and did not hear them . He lay in the dust , unmoving as the crowd surged round him , and for the first time now they noticed that his jaw was broken and that he had blood all over him . At last the rider stirred and came to his senses and spoke , and at his words even the drunkest of them turned cold sober . " Indians ! " he said , and only those nearest him caught the word . " Six thousand of them on their way here , armed to the teeth ! "  | CHAPTER X WHEN SANDY STAGGERED IN WITH THE NEWS HE LOOKED AS IF HE had been chased by a ghost . Lemuel Bowers was not a fighting man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat of being scalped or roasted over a greasewood fire ; but Eilley was not afraid of Indians . Eilley was not afraid of anything . " Calm yourself , Mr. Bowers , " she said firmly . " We 'll chase them back to Pyramid Lake . " " But they 're armed to the teeth ! " said Sandy , remembering what the rider had said . " And six thousand of them ! " " Well , there 's more than six thousand men here . And you 're a man , Mr. Bowers ! " The McCoys came over . Luff was grinning as though the whole thing were a lark . He was carrying an old musket brown with rust . Rebby was shaking with dread . Her face was twitching horribly ? as if it already felt its skin being lifted by a knife . " Eilley , " she said , " we must n't let our men run off and leave us . We 'll be raped ! " Luff bellowed with laughter . He said dryly : " Indians do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scalp them ! " she said . The spasms in her face set him off again . " Indians ai n't very civilized , " he said . " They have n't learned about rape . " " But cheer up , " said Nita , looking scornfully at her terrified stepmother . " There might be one civilized Indian among them . " Eilley took command of the situation . " Let 's go over town , " she said , " and see what is being done . " On their way they met Steve Gilpin . He was chuckling to himself . He had something to show them , he said , and led them up the mountain to a prospect hole . " Look down there . "  | They all knelt and peered and saw in the darkness a pair of wild eyes looking up at them . Rebby drew back with a cry . " It 's a redskin ! " she screamed . " Redskin nothing ! " said Steve . " It 's a Dutchman . He does n't want to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this hole for the duration of the war . The moment he hit bottom he gave an awful yell  --  for he found some tenants down there  --  two men who fell in there last winter and forgot to come out . So there he stands , " said Steve , calmly filling his pipe , " on two dead men . " " It 's a good place for him , " said Eilley . " Only I think he must be an Irishman . " Steve knelt and looked down . " How are you ? " he called . " Take good care of those men while we 're gone ! " " Never mind a cowardly Irishman , " said Eilley impatiently . " Let 's get ready to fight . " " Fight ? " said Steve . " We have no men to fight . They 're all gone . " " Gone where ? " " Over the hills . When they heard the Paiutes were coming with arrows dipped in poison , they  --  well , they just vanished . Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " That was no exaggeration . Eilley marched through the city , followed by the others ; but the saloons , cafes , gambling halls were deserted . At the first news of Indians on the warpath , men had fled by thousands , some vanishing over the hills , some hiding in the mines , and a few retreating to barricaded dugouts . But Eilley saw that Sam Brown was still here . The huge red-whiskered braggart was drunk . He was marching up and down C Street , clutching his knife , and swearing that he alone was a match for all the Indians west of the Missouri . " What cowards men are ! " said Eilley . " Farner Peel , has he gone ? " " Oh , yes . Farner went like a racehorse . " " And  --  and Carter Craig ? " asked Nita . " Oh my , yes . Mr. Craig just took to the air and went like a mallard duck . "  | " Is n't anyone getting ready to defend the place ? " demanded Eilley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize a company . " Eilley went to find him . Meredith , a newcomer and a stranger to nearly everyone here , was a large quiet man who spoke briefly when he had to speak , and preferred not to speak at all . " I hear you 're organizing a company , " Eilley said . " Yes . " " How many men ? " " I do n't know , lady . " " Only a hundred ? " " About . " " You ca n't fight six thousand Indians with a hundred men . " " We can try . " " But what can you do with that many ? " " We can die , " said Meredith . " That 's better than to run . " Eilley was resolved to help  --  for this was her city and she had to defend it ; but there was little she could do . She went from group to group and encouraged the men , and when she had done all she could in the town she climbed high up the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she watched and waited , but the Indians did not come ; but on every visible hilltop , after darkness fell , she could see their signal fires . There were no shadows around the fire  --  nothing but patches of flame against the sky . The Indians were not there , Meredith said . They had built fires to summon the tribes and then had sneaked away to their meeting-place . During the long dark night the volunteers were busy . Some of them made bullets of silver ; and a half-dozen resourceful ones bored out a pine log , ringed it with steel hoops , and fashioned it into a cannon . It might not shoot straight , they said , but it would make the redskins jump right out of their warpaint . " It might shoot both ways , " said Meredith . " It might , " said its inventor . " But it will make a hell of a bang when it goes off and that 's what counts with Injuns . " " What 's your plan of defense ? " Eilley asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " is to fight . At daybreak we 'll march against the Indians . " She went with Sandy to their cabin . " Mr. Bowers , " she said , " get your rifle ready . " Sandy took the old musket down and held it as if it were a rattlesnake . " But I ca n't shoot , Eilley . Dodgast it , I ai n't never fired a gun in all my born days . " " Well , then , it 's time you learned . Just point it at what you want to hit . Then pull the trigger . " Eilley searched in the dim light of the cabin for powder and bullets . Sandy laid the gun down and stared at it as if fascinated . Captain Meredith , he said in a hopeful tone , wanted a man to go to Downieville for aid . Perhaps he could do that . " Our job is here , " Eilley said . " We have to protect our mine . If you do n't march against the Indians , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logically , " it wo n't be no good to me if I 'm roasted . " " Mr. Bowers , " she said coldly , looking him in the eye , " are you afraid ? " " No , " he said , shivering . " Then you 'll march away at daylight . Here 's your bullets and now I 'll fix you a lunch . " At daylight they marched away , a hundred and three of them . There was not an experienced Indian fighter in the whole lot . Sam Brown , red-bearded giant of the company , with a knife and two pistols at his belt and a musket in his arms , looked more enormous than ever on the small donkey under him . The few women in the town gathered to see the men off ; and Eilley saw Julia Bulette at her cottage window , waving goodbyes . Sandy felt a lot better now . He rode between Lull and Steve ; and on a hilltop he turned to wave his hat at Eilley . The spirit of the company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pride of the redskins he would slay . All he had to do , he reflected , was to point his gun at a painted devil and pull the  | trigger , and then reload and point again . Sam Brown said this company was a match for all the Indians west of Fort Laramie . " Well , here we go , " said Steve , " and we 'll be lucky if a single man of us returns alive . " That statement dashed Sandy 's fine bravado . " You do n't figger it thet way , do you ? " he asked anxiously . " Hell , Sandy , look at us : a hundred men going out to face six thousand Indians . " " Mebbe ther ai n't thet many , " said Sandy hopefully . " Well , say five thousand . That 's fifty redskins apiece . " " If we had showed some sense last fall , " said Luff , " and let them gather their pine nuts , they would n't be on the warpath now . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now they 're hungry . But there is n't a good roast in this whole outfit , " said Steve , looking at the men . " Except Sam Brown  --  and they 'll have to cook him for a week . " Sam Brown , riding a little way ahead , had been listening . He now fell back , his huge face grinning at the prospect of slaughter . As usual he had his red whiskers tied with a ribbon under his chin . " You boys ai n't afeard , be you ? " he asked . " Lord , no , " said Steve . " We were just saying you 're the only good roast in the company . " " If you be afeard , " said the great bully , " just leave them to me . I kallate to mow them down . " " Six thousand of them will keep you mowing quite a while . " " You do n't know Injuns , " said Sam . " You carve one of them up slow-like to make him yell good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My old madonnie " ? he slapped his knife ? " will just crawl into their gizzards . Besides , " he added , gazing round him , " I do n't see no signs . " They saw no signs except the ashes of signal fires , but Captain Meredith was not surprised . He said the Indians were skulking and hiding out and would have to be tracked down . After marching all day , with the cannon on an ox-cart fetching up the rear , they camped by a foul stream . Again the second day and the morning of  | the third they marched on , but there were still no Indians . The chuck-wagon was loaded with flour and beans and whisky , powder and ball . Meredith assigned a half-dozen men to the task of cooking , others to the tending of the mules , and others to guard duty . By the afternoon of the third day Meredith was puzzled to know what direction to take and decided to send out a scout . He called for a volunteer and Steve stepped forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of times , " said Steve , lying soberly . " I 'm no Jim Bridger or Kit Carson but I do all right . " " Then you go on ahead . " " I want to take two men with me  --  Sandy and Luff . " " All right . " Meredith halted his company in a wooded area and said he had a feeling the Indians were not far off . He told Steve to go find them . Boldly , as if they were the best scouts in the world , Steve and his friends rode away into the desert . They were three greenhorns and they trotted off in a bee-line , paying no attention to protective ridges or ravines , or to patches of dwarfed timber in which skulking redskins could watch them come . That they were not scalped before sundown they owed only to the fact that the Indians decided to take care of Meredith and his company first . So on the three scouts went , never dreaming that a thousand pairs of eyes were watching every move they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after they had gone some distance . " We must a-scairt them to hell and gone . " " Ah , there 's a sign , " said Steve . " Look at the pony tracks . " Luff had been feeling queer . Perhaps it was the behavior of his mule . Whatever the cause , he had sensed danger , though he could see no sign of any ; and suddenly he drew his beast to a halt . " Steve , " he said , " it 's a funny thing , but I feel we 're in danger . " The three men looked at one another . There was nothing in sight to be afraid of , but they all felt the same chilling dread . It moved in their scalps and over their flesh ; it was a painful constriction in their throats . Their voices sank to a whisper .  | " Can a mule , " asked Sandy hoarsely , " outrun them Injun ponies ? " " No , " Luff said . " I think we best turn back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-away hills where they had left Meredith and his company . " I have a feeling , " Luff whispered , " that they 're all around us . I think they 're watching us now . " The men looked in every direction . South of them there was only barren desert ; but northeast and north were patches of timber and deep ravines . They could see no sign of a moving thing anywhere . While they waited and scanned the clumps of brush , trying to see movement there , Luff felt , with the same vivid certainty of a few moments ago , that all the watchful eyes had been withdrawn . The behavior of his mule had changed . " I think the Indians have gone , " he said , speaking aloud . " What makes you say that ? " " I do n't know . But I feel it . " " I sort of feel that way too . " " I guess we scairt them , " Sandy said . " No , " said Steve , and for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder , came a roar from far away . It was the cannon . Steve looked at Luff . " Meredith must have been attacked . " " It sounds that way . " They listened and heard the sound of muskets . " By God , " said Steve , " we 're certainly fine scouts ! " " What should we do now ? " asked Sandy . He was trembling and hugging his gun to him . " There 's only one thing we can do , " said Steve . " Go back and fight . " They swung round and galloped back over the hills ; but long before they came in sight of Meredith and his ninety-nine men , the fight was finished . They sensed that when the firing stopped as suddenly as it had begun . " It 's all over ! " Steve cried ; and detouring behind one hilltop  | after another , the scouts rode furiously until they came in sight of the battleground . They had no need to ride across a half-mile of sagebrush to read the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a distance that Meredith and his handful of men had been wiped out . The Indians had all vanished and there was no sign of life . There were only scattered bodies , Indian and white , pony and mule . " Come ! " Steve said , and at full speed he headed south toward home . The mules they rode were not fast but they were tough . In singlefile , with Steve leading and Luff behind , they galloped mile after mile , never pausing , but often looking back . There was no sign of pursuit . It was past midnight when they stopped to rest their beasts on the highest hill they could find ; and after an hour they rode on again . In Virginia City , meanwhile , the thousands who had fled returned to saloon and gambling hall . They poured whisky down their throats and boasted ; but at any hint of danger , any empty cry of alarm , they vanished again , fleeing into holes or to the deepest recesses of the mines . In the gray dawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . He was covered with alkali and sweat ; he was so exhausted he could hardly breathe . Eilley was among those who ran out to meet him ; and her heart almost stopped when , cursing , weeping , he fell off his mule and poured out his tale . The company had been ambushed , he said . There had been a massacre . The few survivors had fled in all directions like things thrown off a great flywheel ; and the last time he saw Meredith , that brave man was standing alone , deserted , with countless Indians closing in . And then , his eyes burning in a face coated with dust , the man sank exhausted to his heels . " Are they all dead but you ? " Eilley demanded , feeling something akin to fear . " God , lady , I do n't know . I ai n't seen any of them since the fight was over . "  | News of the ambush spread through the town . Drunkards came out of saloons and tents and dugouts ; but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sam Brown rode in . He had so nearly killed his donkey that the beast dropped when Sam dismounted . But Sam was all right . He was covered with white dust and looked fatigued but he was as boastful as ever . Into the muzzle of his rifle he had thrust an arrow , and impaled on the arrow he had the bloody scalp of an Indian . He held it up as if the black mane were a flag . " They 're comun , boys , " he said , " but right now Sam Brown is got a-have a drink . " " Who 's coming ? " asked a man . " The redskins . I piled them up in heaps , but ever time I killed one , a dozen jumped at me . So I says Sam , Brown is got a-have a drink . " " Mr. Brown , " said one timid fellow with comical politeness , " what happened ? " " Why , you pernickety little weasel , ai n't I been a-tellun you ? God-all-creation , we fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick huckleberries ? " Whisky gurgled like water down Sam 's throat . " Where is Lemuel Bowers ? " Eilley asked in a calm voice that belied her feelings . Sam turned to look at her . " Him ? Scalped alive and et up . " Feeling deathly sick , Eilley returned to her cabin , and there she found Rebby and Nita . Rebby was not thinking of the men who had been slain . She appeared unconcerned about Luff . She was wondering if any of the slaughtered men owned a mine here , and that was what made her face twitch as she broached the exciting possibility to Eilley . " What kind of a woman are you ? " Eilley cried . " You think of mines when your husband lies dead ! " " He ai n't dead , " declared Rebby calmly . " Nor Sandy neither . I had a dream . " " She dreamt , " said Nita , " she saw them down in a deep hole . "  | " Deep hole ! " said Eilley scornfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole ! " " Do n't get all excited , " said Rebby , still speaking calmly . " There 's your unborn child to think of . It will be birthmarked all over . " " Shut up ! " said Eilley , exasperated . " Well , that ai n't no way to talk to a friend . Sandy will come back . " Sandy and his friends were coming as fast as tired mules could carry them ; but it was late afternoon before they arrived . Eilley was sitting in dark grief when the cabin door burst open and Sandy staggered in , so weak from terror and hard riding that he dropped to the floor and sprawled on his back . With a wild cry , Eilley sat by him and drew his dusty face to her breast . " Mr. Bowers , are you hurt ? " " No , " said Sandy . " Tired , thet 's about all . " " You poor , poor dear ! " she said , crooning over him . Then , recovering her composure almost at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me all about it . " " I do n't hardly know , " said Sandy simply . " Captain Meredith , him and most of them was killed . " " Are the Indians coming ? " " I guess so  --  but we never stopped to find out . " " Did you shoot any Indians ? " " I never got no chance , " he said petulantly . " Heck , I was a scout . And Steve , he said we better light out fer home , and we lit . " " Well , John Mackay went to Downieville for help . The soldiers will be here soon . " Eilley considered a moment and then drew Sandy 's face to her swollen belly . " Mr. Bowers , feel , " she said , and Sandy lay against her , feeling the stirring of unborn life .  | CHAPTER XI THE SIERRA BATTALION CAME IN FROM CALIFORNIA , PARADED DOWN C Street , and marched away to the north ; and word came a few days later that the Paiutes had been annihilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his company avenged , with the redskins as completely destroyed as their pine nut orchards , Virginia City was all set to become the most murderous and hellbent spot on earth . That it would be so , Luff McCoy and a few others never doubted , although Eilley Bowers still dreamed that it would be a lovely and law-abiding city . The population now and for a long time to come was divided into two irreconcilable groups . Overwhelmingly in the majority were those who wanted a lawless camp , with the police and other officers as deadheads who kept out of sight and minded their business . A small group , which included , besides Eilley , a few ministers and business and professional men , were resolved to have a respectable town . In this summer of 1860 there was no law , no justice , no peace . Confusions and feuds and conflicting hungers had multiplied tenfold . Claims not only overlapped ; claim had been staked upon claim until in embattled areas they were five and six deep . Corrupt judges , smelling bribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the margin , looking in . In their minds , and in the minds of thousands , there was only lust for wealth . Typical of the adventurers was Dave Terry , late of the California supreme court , a duelist with several notches on his gun ; a gentleman who fancied fine clothes and pomp and the sound of his own voice . He was a man with a past . He had resigned from the bench to kill U. S. Senator Broderick who had opposed slavery in California ; and a little later he had thrust a knife through the jugular vein of an officer . Dave Terry had come to the area to claim it for the  | Confederacy , and to establish slavery and be governor ; but he wanted riches too . His inordinate desire of it was loud and exclamatory in everything he said and did . With a bodyguard of rabid secesh men , mounted on fine horses , he liked to ride through the city as if he owned it ; and to prowl in the mines to learn how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was another who was a doctor and a cousin of a famous poet . He always wore a silk hat , frock coat , and high polished boots  --  a splendid and empty gentleman who swaggered and kept a predatory nose in every wind . He wanted wealth and power , but he did not intend to work for them . He intended to stumble upon a fortune or to marry one ; and day after day he gestured with soft white hands , laughed purringly at no matter what , and waited for a chance to plunder . There were thousands like him in Virginia City and in Gold Hill  --  a rival camp just across the Divide : stealthy parasites who kept aloof like gaudy birds of prey , watching developments and ready to drop . There was a handsome fop who was called The Baron because he was the descendant of a British peer . He affected a slouch hat , an open shirt , baggy trousers , and unpolished boots ; but he was only one jump from a title and could afford to . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be . His eyes were brightly cunning behind their drooping lids . He and his kind were less men than elated creatures who never slept , never paused , but kept to the search day and night . The saloons were jammed with them . Hunger for silver was their obsession . Steve Gilpin said it was their nightmare . There was Fred Grebe . Eilley had at last leased her claim for development , and Fred was her superintendent . Fred , it was said , woke up ten times every night , yelling as if he were being skinned alive ; and then sank back into a delirium of snores . Fred wanted a mine of his own  --  and he intended to have one too ; but he was a sly wolf of a man who was forever stumbling over his own greed . It drove him to do inexplicable things , cruel and inhuman things . Fred had been superintendent of the Kentuck . One day he had  | entered the stope where Luff and John Mackay and other men were laboring . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabolic craftiness ; and then he accosted the most inoffensive man of the lot and asked for tobacco . Fred knew that smoking was not allowed in the mines . " There ai n't no smokun allowed here , " the man said . " You mean , " asked Fred , pretending to be astonished , " you never smoke down here ? " " No sir . " " But you 've got tobacco in your coat , ai n't you ? " " Yes sir . " " Then give me some to fill my pipe . " " But there ai n't no smokun allowed down here . " " Listen , fellow , who is superintendent of the Kentuck ? " " You are , sir . " " Then give me some tobacco . " The man fetched his pouch and Fred thoughtfully stoked his pipe . He did not light it . Only fools struck matches underground . Instead , he went back to the surface ; and nobody was surprised to learn , very shortly , that the man who gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , inquired softly about him , pretended to be indignant upon learning that the man was jobless , and said he would help him find a job . That was Fred Grebe , a sly and sadistic villain whom even Sam Brown despised . " I do n't think , " Luff ventured one day to Eilley , " that you want Fred Grebe as your superintendent . " " Why not ? " she asked . " The men do n't like him . " Eilley Bowers was a shrewd woman in some ways , but in reading the hearts of men she was less than a child . She had liked Fred . He had been soft-spoken , gentlemanly , eager to please . " Does n't Mr. Grebe know mining as well as any man here ? " " I guess mebbe he does . " " Then he 's the man I need . " Luff was now working in Eilley 's mine . John Mackay had remained  | in the Kentuck because the stock of the Kentuck was in feet instead of shares and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw John as the two men left their shifts . " Hey , John ! " " Yes ? " said John Mackay , coming over . In John Mackay , Luff had sensed a slow and indefinable change . It was not in anything John had said or done . Perhaps it was something in Mackay 's eyes when he wiped his brow and looked around him , or when he saw large florets of silver in a vein . He was a man with gentle eyes , but little by little his eyes were losing their gentleness . " I understand you 're taking your wages in feet . " " Yes , " said John Mackay . " Would you still be satisfied with twenty-five thousand ? " Mackay looked around him . " I want power , " he said . " Every man does . " " Power to do what ? " asked Luff , grinning . Mackay did not like such questions . " If you have money , " he said a little curtly , " you can do things . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , I 've knowed you for a long time . We placered together in California . You did n't have that look in your eye then . " " What look ? " Luff slapped his friend 's shoulder and laughed . " The look they all have . You 're getting it . " John Mackay looked at the laughing blue in Luff 's eyes . " We all want to be rich , " he said . " You 'd grab a million if you could . " " No , John , I would n't  --  and I 'll tell you why . My wife is hard enough to live with now . If I was wealthy I could n't stand her airs . It ai n't silver that worries me . It 's these mines we work in . We 'll all get buried alive some day . " Mackay 's smile was very thin . " Yes  --  but if a man owns a mine , " he said , " he can stay on top . " On his way home , Luff was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its poisonous gases , crumbling walls , sudden  | I inroads of water , Eilley 's was no different from any other . Rats exploded in her mine too when they slipped and fell . In the untimbered galleries and stopes of her mine , death could strike unexpectedly in a dozen ways . In the Kentuck a dog had fallen two hundred feet and killed two men at the bottom of a shaft . There , too , cars of ore had slipped their anchors and come down with a thunderous crash ; careless men at the surface had allowed hunks of ore to fall back into the depths ; the walls of galleries had caved in ; poisonous gases had driven men choked and purple to the surface ; and floods of water had trapped and drowned men in the sumps . Eilley , too , was driving ahead for silver and letting men risk their lives in drifts and crosscuts unsupported by timbers . Luff was no coward , but working under constant threat of death did something to a man . He had seen men die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rode up and down . Over the mouth of the shaft was a large crossbeam , together with the framework bearing the pulleys and wheels for the cable . The cage was a heavy iron bucket with grooves on either side that ran upon guides . Hoisted or lowered by a steam engine , the cage moved at lightning speed . On the way up or down it passed different levels and stations , and in passing , men caught a swift glimpse of other men , heard a murmur of voices ; and then all was quiet . The cage did not have sides high enough to protect those who rode in it , and if a man carelessly thrust his head out , he was decapitated before his companions could say scat . And that had happened many times . Usually only the man 's head was jerked off and the body rode to the surface ; but now and then the whole body vanished . Once , after a man had been jerked out , the cage was lowered to the bottom but there was no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered slowly and men picked the fragments of him off the rock of the shaft . He had been torn into a thousand pieces . On a splinter of stone hung part of an arm ; on a small shelf was a thumb . They gathered him piece by piece but they never found his head or any part of it except a tuft of hair . That kind of death , Luff reflected philosophically , was by no  | means the worst kind . A man was gone in a flash and was dead before he could feel pain or realize he was going . Men had been buried alive under avalanches and had been left there . Men had been drowned when a blast released a sudden deluge of underground water that poured in and flooded a crosscut or a winze . Men had been blown to pieces by delayed fuses . But nobody seemed to give any thought to all that  --  nobody indeed , unless it was Adolph Sutro , a Jew who had come here to look around . Sutro said it was all stupid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be driven under the mountain to drain and ventilate the mines ; and on the floor of the tunnel should be a steel track so the ore could be taken out on a gravity haul . The owners of mines said Adolph was crazy . A tunnel would take years to build and would cost millions . They wanted to gut these mines in a hurry and move on to other fields . In a year or two , they said , there would be no silver left in the Comstock Lode . Eilley Bowers did not believe that . Her vision told her , sharply and clearly , that the ore lay to a great depth and was almost inexhaustible ; but men said she was crazy too . In spite of her belief , Eilley had no more time for Sutro and his tunnel than other owners had . She , too , wanted to be fabulously wealthy in a few months or a year ; for did she not have to build a mansion and go to Europe , and could a sensible woman wait on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said to Sandy . " Goodness in heaven , does he expect us to wait twenty years while he digs a hole ? " " Ten years , " said Sandy . " Thet is all of the time it would take . " " Ten years ! Who wants to wait on a Jew that long ? Besides , Mr. Bowers , you should not worry me with such things . " " Thet 's right , " Sandy agreed . " I only was a-tellun you " Do n't fret me about trifles . Do you want to put a birthmark on your unborn son ? " " Of course not , " he said , blinking at Eilley 's huge girth . Having a child , Eilley believed , would be for her a critical ordeal ; so she moved back to the larger cabin where the lonely and faithful Louisa could be midwife and nurse . Her mine was producing now , but during the days when she felt birth approaching she never thought of her mine . " I 'll soon have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to make the miracle secure ; and sometimes she acted so giddy that Sandy was alarmed . " A son ! " she said to anybody who would listen . " Just think of it  --  a child all my own ! "  | But when the child came it was a scrawny premature babe that hardly looked human . Sandy was appalled . Somehow he had expected the child to be a robust youngster able to sit up and coo and look smartly around . This red and hairless and wrinkled creature , shamefully naked and helpless , and unable to nurse or give more than a wailing unearthly sound , was almost as bad as Rebby had said it would be . " I told you , " said Rebby , coming down the canyon to have a look . " And if it ai n't birthmarked like a redskin 's warpaint , that 's a wonder . " " Birthmarked ! " said Eilley indignantly , and hugged the handful of skin and bones to her breast . " It looks like any baby should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebby . " Its skin should be filled out plumplike . To tell the truth , " she added , peering again , " it looks like its father . " Sandy 's face turned crimson . " Go home ! " said Louisa tartly . " You ai n't of no earthly use around here . Go back and see what mischief your daughter is up to . " " That Indian ai n't my daughter , " said Rebby with infuriating calm . " My children was all fair-complected and blue-eyed . They was strong and healthy . " " Because you ai n't got no mine , " said Louisa , " that 's your trouble . You like to find fault . " Rebby ignored that . She leaned forward to have another look at John Jasper Bowers . " Unless you have a care he 'll be as dead as a doornail in a month . I'n see signs of death all over him . " " Oh , goodness in heaven , " cried Eilley furiously , " go on back home ! Leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how you feel . I just try and give good advice but some  | folks wo n't listen . " At the door Rebby turned . " If I'n be of any help , just call me . Or call a doctor , that 's what I 'd do . " After Rebby had gone , Sandy went to the shed that had once been his cabin and his home and wept . The fault , he believed , was all his own . If he were tall and broad-shouldered , if he did not have a racking cough and twinging pains , he would not have sired a weakling . It was not Eilley 's fault . She was strong and healthy . He wondered if it was the brandy he had drunk before the child was conceived . A little later , Louisa came out to find him and led him sniffling to the house . Eilley drew him to the bed and cradled him in one arm and the babe in the other . " Lemuel , " she said  --  it was rarely she called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Our son will be all right . " " Honest ? " he asked . He felt comforted . Eilley was always infallibly right . But the child did not grow stronger . It was sickly and sleepless , and wasted away to a horrible picture of empty skin . Eilley had Louisa summon a doctor , a tall lean man of oracular speech ; and after looking at the babe he said there was nothing a doctor could do . " God gives , " he said , " and God takes away , and doctors make little progress against the divine plan . " " You talk like a preacher , " said Eilley impatiently . " I told Louisa to call a doctor . " " I am a physician , " he replied , " but God is the Great Physician , and God and medicine do not always mix . The child might live if you nurse him faithfully . " In all his years afterward , Sandy was to remember these weeks of Eilley 's unfaltering devotion . Night and day , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , hugging it , breathing upon it , murmuring to it , as if by strength of will and love she could bring it to vigorous life . Sometimes Sandy or Louisa wept to see her desperate efforts ; sometimes they left the cabin , unable to endure the grief and pain . But Eilley was unaware of all that . She no longer remembered that she was in a cabin in Gold Canyon , or that great  | wagons were hauling ore from her mine . With all the sharpened consciousness of her being she fought for the life of her firstborn . But she fought in vain . One morning before daylight Sandy was awakened by Eilley 's presence out in the shed , where he had been sleeping since the baby came . She had made no sound , but he opened his eyes and saw her sitting by him in the gloom . Her arms were empty . There was in her face such grief as he had never seen . Without speaking , she laid her head on his breast and put his limp arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead .  | CHAPTER XII THE MORNING WHEN THEY STOOD TOGETHER IN THE SAGEBRUSH AND looked at a small fresh grave , Sandy wept quietly but Eilley did not weep . No matter what bitter disappointments came to her , she was the kind of woman who buried the past and lived for the future . Adversity made her strength of purpose more invincible and her will more resolute . God had taken her firstborn but she would have another child ; and meanwhile there was work to be done . Some day , she said , they would take their son up and lay him in a beautiful spot where grass would grow and flowers would bloom . " Mr. Bowers , we must be brave . It does no good to weep . " " I know it , " said Sandy , shaking with grief . " Now you had better go over and see if our mine is all right . We have n't been able to look after it much lately . " The mine which Sandy had wanted to sell for a handful of coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would pay millions , Eilley said , before silver gave way to water and sand . Now that her child was gone , she could give all her energy to other matters ; and on a day when the first frost  --  pogonip , the Indians called it  --  spread its jewels on the hills , she climbed to a ledge of granite above her old cabin . It was , she decided , after smiting it with a hammer to test its hardness , what a mansion should be made of . Across the valley at the base of the great Sierras , Sandy owned a piece of land with a hot spring on it ; and there she had resolved to have one of the handsomest homes west of Scotland . Within a week she employed a master mason and several quarrymen ; and while they blasted and chiseled in the granite ledge , winter passed and Eilley was pregnant again . " While they 're building our mansion we 'll go to Europe , " she announced one day .  | To every plan of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " he said . " Ther ai n't many ways to spend coin in this-here land . " He considered a moment before proposing a notion he had cherished . " Let 's give a big party before we go . " " Why , Mr. Bowers ? " " Oh , we 're rich , and I figgered a party would be nice . A farewell party it could be . " " That would be all right ; but we must wait till our child is born . " " Eilley , " he said , emboldened by her approval , " Luff , he says you should buy more timber . He says our mine will cave in some day and kill them all . " " Nonsense ! " she retorted . " It 's like all the other mines . I ca n't spend all our money for beams . I should think , Mr. Bowers , that you 'd have better things to do than listen to a drunken windbag . " " I just told you what he says . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let him find work somewhere else . " " Lull says Fred Grebe , he likes to see the men killed . " " Luff McCoy is an old trouble-maker . Mr. Bowers , it will be best to choose your friends more carefully after this . Luff is just a mucker . " " Well , " said Sandy humbly , " I ai n't much but a mule-skinner . " He was distressed by the way the two families were growing apart . They had been quite friendly during that terrible winter of cold and famine and snowslides ; but the McCoys rarely came to see them now . Eilley said they would always be as poor as a hen 's forehead ; they would be nobody at all . There were people here , she told her husband , who would one day be important and wealthy and these they should meet and accept as friends ; but for Sandy Bowers , friendship was a firm bridge between poverty and riches . " Could I invite Luff and John to our party ? " asked Sandy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . " " He would be all right . He might be a rich man some day . As for Luff McCoy , I 'll see . We must n't make mistakes in important matters  | like this . Besides , Mr. Bowers , you should n't worry me about such things before our child is born . " " Thet 's right , " said Sandy contritely , and dropped the subject . The second child was a girl . Eilley named her Theresa Fortunatus ; and though she wished that her second child , like her first , had been a son , she loved Theresa with the same devotion she had given to John . Devotion , she decided , was needed , because this child too was thin and sickly ; but the doctor said her daughter would improve in health as she grew older , and said a long ocean voyage would be good for both of them . Things were going well with them now . Eilley was really happy for the first time in her life , for she was already realizing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mine was pouring riches in her lap in a continuous and ever-increasing stream . There was no reason , so far as she could see , why it should not continue to do so indefinitely . So one day she announced to her husband , in the tone of final authority which was becoming more and more habitual to her : " Mr. Bowers , the time has come to plan our trip to Europe . " Thought of the trip filled Sandy with dread . " Do n't you think we should ought to wait till our girl is bigger ? " " We have no time to wait . Our mansion is going up and we must go abroad to buy things for it . You know very well we ca n't get anything decent here . Would you wait around until Theresa is a grown lady ? " " Not thet long , " he said . " Now is the time to go . We need many things . " " But ai n't we to give thet-there party ? " Eilley considered the matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish herself now as the social leader of Virginia City and Gold Hill . A few wives of superintendents and mine owners had come in and were giving themselves airs . But if she gave a party , it must be , it would be , the most overwhelming event these people had ever seen . It would cost a lot  --  but of money Eilley would soon have more than she could spend . The mine was now  | paying thirty-five thousand dollars a month , and would double and redouble that sum . She could give her party at the brand-new International Hotel , a gaudy and florid and false-fronted structure on which a speculator had spent a fortune . She would invite only the ladies and gentlemen , the few persons of breeding and taste ; for , although she would have the finest of foods and wines , she would not debase herself by being hostess at a vulgar brawl of gluttony and drunkenness . Perhaps But while Eilley was still considering and planning , word came to her that the superintendent of the Overman mine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town . This man already had a huge house with solid silver doorknobs throughout . He had blooded horses and a stable decorated with unprecedented extravagance . He had bought , Eilley had heard , entire libraries bound in morocco , costly pieces of art , rare rugs and shawls from the Orient ; but , like other men of wealth , he devoted himself chiefly to champagne and rare old wines , and lobster brought on ice all the way from New York . " Will we go to his party ? " Sandy asked . " I 'll think about it . " Eilley was amazed by the man 's vulgar extravagance . She could match it , of course ; she could , if she wished , far exceed it ; but she was resolved not to compete with those whose idea of culture was to buy every costly thing in sight . And the way rich persons here were beginning to squander their wealth was only another reason why she must go to Europe . Over there she could buy choice things of the rarest distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they behaved ; and when she returned to Virginia City , there would be in her mansion , in herself and husband , and in all that she approved and fostered , the discrimination of one who had traveled widely and had seen the best . That was a reason also why she ought to go to this man 's party ; for there she would see crude prodigality at its worst ; and , knowing  | what to avoid , her own party would shine all the more brilliantly in contrast . " We 'll go , " she finally told her husband , and Sandy was delighted . Upon entering the rich man 's house she felt as if she had stepped into a bedlam . The great parlor was full of drunken men and drunken harlots , all shouting and yelling as if mad ; furniture was overturned , glasses broken , and everywhere lay bottles spilling their contents on the rugs and tables . Crawling on the floor , unable to stand , their fine broadcloth suits stained with wine and food , were men who looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving among them in rose velvet and flirting a crimson fan was ? of all people ! ? Julia Bulette . There was no sign of host or hostess . Nobody was receiving the guests . Nobody seemed to care who came or went , or what anybody did . Earlier , it seemed , there had been a banquet ; food was still heaped in dishes on sideboards ; it had been spilled on the floor ; it had been smeared over the white shirt fronts of the men . But now there was only unrestrained drunkenness . " It 's shameful ! " said Eilley to her husband . " It 's a disgrace to Virginia City . " " It sure is , " said Sandy . Resolved to see the worst of it , Eilley moved in the throng of revelers with Sandy at her side . It was evident that the host had spared no expense . Among his luxuries were fine Havana cigars , which were now scattered everywhere like the food and the flowers . Men had cigars stuck like pencils behind their ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used them as canes to prod their friends ; and a few of them were puffing on two cigars at once , or were chewing them hanging wet and unlighted from both corners of their mouths . Boxes of candy had been spilled and their contents trampled underfoot . Masses of flowers had been strewn and crushed ; and their fragrance , mixed with the fumes of alcohol , the smoke of cigars , and the odor of paint and powder on the faces of harlots , filled the house . Men had flowers stuck in their hair and beards ; some of them had flowers thrust between their necks and collars and  | standing in a girdle around their heads . The face of one grotesque fellow was completely hidden by a hedge of cut roses , and the man stumbled around as if blind ; but now and then he would shove the neck of a bottle through the hedge to his mouth and drink long and deep . Some , weary of standing and unable to find chairs , had yanked books from shelves and piled them one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others had turned big vases bottomside up and sat on them ; and Eilley observed that one of the harlots had torn a painting from its gilded frame and was using it as a fan . She sagged indecently with one hip thrust out , one elbow on the shoulder of a man prostrate over a wine keg , and gazed in boredom at the vivacious Julia . If there were any respectable women here , Eilley could see no sign of them . Steve Gilpin came up , grinning and elated . It always delighted his sardonic soul to see human beings make fools of themselves . He was now one of the editors of the Territorial Enterprise , the city 's rip-snorting newspaper ; and he was the most persistent hoaxer of all the wags in town . He took wicked delight , it seemed to Eilley , in making donkeys of his fellowmen . " Hello , Eilley . How do you like the party ? " " It 's disgraceful ! " " It 's Virginia City  --  and Virginia City is the soul of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will win the war for Lincoln , so why should n't we celebrate ? " " I 'd think , " said Eilley severely , " that a newspaper man like you would help me make this a decent and respectable city . " " Nothing can be respectable , Eilley , unless it 's poor . We 're too rich here  --  and we have n't even got a good start yet . " On the arm of Carter Craig , Nita came by in a handsome gown , her black hair full of roses . She turned a haughty stare on Eilley , but Craig bowed in greeting ; and behind them came Rebby , looking as always like a fishwife on the warpath . She was searching for her husband . " Sandy , " she said , " where is that drunken pig ? "  | " You mean Luff ? " " I mean that whisky-bloated Irishman ! " " I ai n't seen him . " " I saw him a while ago , " said Steve . " He told me he had three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour Rebby had been worming through the crowd , rubbing elbows with every man who looked wealthy and important , trying to absorb from this evening of riotous living a vicarious sense of her own worth . She was a pathetic old fool , Steve reflected , watching her trail after Craig . She was like a chilled creature out of darkness , warming in sunlight not its own . " I hear , " he said , turning again to Eilley , " that you intend to give a party . " " It wo n't be like this , " she said , staring at an addled gentleman who was striving vainly to sit up . Just then a man came from a back room , and after him came two others , dragging a long trough of the kind used to water cattle . They set the trough in the middle of the room . Then they brought case after case of champagne and poured the foaming liquid into the trough . " Ladies and gentlemen ! " roared the man . " Give me your attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked back and forth on their heels , their eyes out of focus . Harlots leaned tipsily on any man who happened to be near . " The good red blood of joy , " continued the man , " flows too slow out of a bottle ; so I have a nice big trough here , and those of you who are thirsty will  --  will crawl forth and drink ! " The scene that followed was incredible . Drunkards crawled forward on hands and knees like beasts , and like beasts they thrust their muzzles into the trough and drank . Like hogs they rooted and grunted at one another ; and the harlots moved in behind and kicked them on their rumps and yelled . One man soon had the mob howling with delight . He thrust his face into the champagne clear to his hairline and blew jets out of it ; he gurgled as if drowning ; he  | sent rumbling bellows through the liquid ; and from time to time he lifted his head to squirt champagne at his neighbors . Seeing that his antics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his neck and ringed it with spouting geysers . After a man had drunk his fill , he was rooted aside and another took his place . On either side of the trough they knelt in a row , gulping the liquid , withdrawing their faces to breathe ; and other bottles were poured in as the level sank . Their bellies filled , the men moved away and sprawled and rolled over on their backs ; and harlots sat on their chests and fed them candy or lit their cigars . Eilley glanced at her husband . He had been coughing as suggestively as he dared , and Eilley saw that his mouth was watering . " Mr. Bowers , look at yourself ! " " Huh ? " he said , startled . " You 're slobbering on your shirt . " " Gosh , so I am , " he said , looking very silly . " Well , I was thinkun . " " So was I , but I do n't have to slobber when I think . Come , Mr. Bowers ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they start to puke . " Their party , she told Sandy on the way home , would be respectable and wellbred . No harlots would be there , no drunkards , no loutish boors gulping out of a watering trough . They would invite only the three or four ladies and the twenty-five or thirty real gentlemen from the two towns . Sandy listened unhappily ; he had stood for an hour with fine old brandies and whiskies , wines and champagnes , flowing all around him , and he had not had a single drink . " But wo n't they come anyways ? " he said . " If they do we 'll throw them out . If that Julia Bulette shows her wicked face I 'll slap it . " " Thet would make us a lot of enemies , " said Sandy , who had his moments of realism . " If slapping a whore makes me enemies , then I want no friends . " " All right , you slap her , then ; ' cause I bet she comes . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own . She engaged the entire first floor of the International  | Hotel ; she went to caterers and ordered the finest  --  or at least the most expensive  --  in food and drink and flowers ; and in her own handwriting she invited the few whom she wanted to come . One of these was Belinda Corey , wife of a wealthy mine-owner . Belinda had social ambitions . The best way to crush them , it seemed to Eilley , was to overwhelm them at once and make the woman ashamed of her own efforts . To Mrs. Corey she wrote : bowers mine 7 september 1861 dear mrs corey , before mr bowers and I leave for europe we plan to give a little farewell party it would be our pleasure to have the presence of you and mr corey the date will be announced in the enterprise later your kind friend mrs alison orrum bowers Rumor  --  perhaps it came from that sardonic prankster , Steve Gilpin  --  went through the two towns that Eilley 's farewell party would astound even those who had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own way it did . Its feast of food and drink , to which thirty-odd guests sat down , would have pleased the most gluttonous of ancient kings . Because it was the most expensive item on the table , lobster was the favorite dish ; and it was lobster prepared with minced shallot , Madeira , and sauce Allemande ; it was lobster thermidor and lobster farcie ; it was lobster Spanish style with white wine , minced garlic and onion , parsley , tomato , and bay leaf ; and it was lobster American style , with brandy , celery , parsley and thyme . It was frogs ' legs in butter , white wine , tomato , green pepper ; it was baked eels ; it was cod in oyster sauce ; it was chicken livers in mushroom sauce ; it was ducks in olives and wine . There was no roast peacock , but there would have been if Eilley had been able to get it . Of champagnes and wines , whiskies and brandies , cordials and liqueurs , there was everything that came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who was more guest than host ? hardly knew what to do with such largess of food and drink . Sitting  | at the far end from Eilley , and looking red and pained , he stared at the shining tableware , at the immaculate linen , and ran a trembling finger between his neck and stiff collar , remembering that not long ago he had been a penniless mule-skinner . This farewell party , Eilley had told him , had cost twenty-five thousand dollars . That was now only a two weeks ' income from the mine , but it was enough , Sandy reflected , to buy a stock ranch as large as a county . He had not known there was so much to eat and drink in the world ; nor did he know how or where to begin , or which of the many tools and glasses around his plate belonged to him and which to the haughty Mrs. Corey on his right . That icy lady gave him a cold social smile and said : " I understand you are going abroad ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He drew to his face a napkin that looked to him as large as a horse blanket and coughed as politely as he could . " It 's Eilley 's idear , " he added , looking out from the napkin . " Your wife , Mr. Bowers , is a very charming hostess . " If there was malice in the remark , Sandy did not sense it . He was unaware of all the subtle ironies with which highborn ladies strove to slay one another . " I guess she is , " he said , looking down the series of long tables at his wife . On her right Eilley had placed John Mackay , though she hardly knew why . A year ago he was only a common miner ; now he was said to be wealthy . But wealth was not the chief reason why she had given him the place of honor . In the soft-spoken and polite Mackay she sensed a man of mystery and power and the qualities of a gentleman . He was an Irishman , of course , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her left was Adolph Sutra , the Austrian Jew . Perhaps she sensed in him another man of destiny , or perhaps it was because the handsome Sutro looked like a gentleman . Sutro was talking about his favorite subject , the need of a tunnel under the mountain , and most of the guests were listening with  | amusement or scorn . Steve Gilpin , sitting midway down the tables , was amused . " Sutro , " he said , " your tunnel may be a sound idea  --  I would n't know  --  but we do n't want to hear you rant about it tonight . What we want is a speech from Mr. Lemuel Sanford Bowers . He is going to Europe and he ought to tell us about it . " There was murmuring approval . Sandy , so laced and bound in his fashionable clothes that he looked strangled , licked his dry lips and wondered what he could say . His guests waited . Eilley was gazing fondly across at him as if he were a gentle and lackwitted son ; and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a little speech . " Noting his distress , she left her seat , moving like a huge inverted funnel in the flounces of her hoop skirt , and went down the tables to stand by his side . Sandy looked up at her stupidly , helplessly , and tongued his lips . He rose awkwardly , knocking his chair over and turning for a moment to look at it . " Well ? " he began . " Do n't be bashful , Sandy , " somebody said . " You 're going over to visit the kings . Come on and tell us about it . " " Well , " said Sandy , making another effort , " I want a-tell you folks I 've had some powerful good luck in this-here country . Now I got money to throw at the birds . Not long ago , ther was n't a coin in my pockets  --  but now  --  now I got money to throw at the birds . " He paused , as if unable to think of anything else to say , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , ther ai n't no chance fer a gentleman to spend his coin in this-here nation , so me and Mrs. Bowers , we aim to see Yoorup and the sights . Ther ai n't many folks worth seeun in this-here land . Mebbe Horace Greeley and likewise old Winnemucca . What we really got our hearts set on is to see some kings and queens and swap some chin-music , and  --  well , them importin folks acrosst the sea . " He looked around hopefully to learn if he had said enough . " Are you coming back ? "  | " Oh , yes , " he said . " We aim to come back and live in the mansion we 're a-buildun and enjoy ourselfs a while . " " When you get over there , " said Steve , " remember that you represent the greatest and richest city on earth ; so do n't bow to the kings but just shake their hands and say , How in hell are you ? ' Say , Old Fel , come to Virginia City and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about thet , " said Sandy , and looked at his wife . " Spend money by the carload and let them see how rich we are . " Sandy grinned . " Oh , we aim to spend some coin , all right . " After Sandy had sat down and Eilley had returned to her place , Steve rose , his face gravely sardonic . " Ladies and gentlemen , I propose a toast to Mrs. Alison Orrum Hunter Cowan Bowers , the coming Queen of the Comstock ! " The guests rose and drank the toast . How Steve had guessed her secret ambition , Eilley did not know ; her face was a cherry red . " Now , " said the unquenchable Steve , " I propose that Mrs. Bowers give us a little speech . " Eilley rose . This was the proudest and most triumphant moment of her life . She looked at Mrs. Corey 's rope of counterfeit pearls and cleared her throat . " Mr. Bowers has said about all there is to say . God has favored us and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We expect to meet a lot of important persons over there ; but also , we must buy furnishings for our mansion . There is n't very much to buy in this country , " she said , remembering the watering trough . " You expect to meet Queen Victoria ? " someone asked . " I had n't given it much thought , " said Eilley , too smart to be trapped . " Well , if you do , put on diamonds as big as mule collars . Let her see that England may have the dugout Shakespeare was born in , but we have all the coin . " " I expect to be a lady , " said Eilley stiffly , " and to meet ladies and gentlemen . " " I expect ? " She stopped . She was looking toward the entrance . There , as bold as brandy , stood that notoriously crimson woman , Julia Bulette.  | Whether Julia had timed her entrance or some wag had timed it for her , nobody could have said ; but at the most dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazzling vision in black and white  --  though the only white about her , Eilley observed at once , was her skin and her diamonds . She stood a moment , alone , and then marched in ; and behind her came a dozen handsomely dressed gentlemen . Then Carter Craig appeared with Nita McCoy , and behind them came others ; and Eilley , overwhelmed by this vulgar invasion , sank to her chair . Some of her guests had risen in loud welcome ; and one of them had the insolence to say : " Come in , come in ! When a party is given in Virginia City , it belongs to the town ! " Eilley was too outraged to speak or move . She could observe only that Julia wore a very tight bodice that set off her full bosom and her slender waist  --  that spread downward in billows and a great mass of jet spangles , with puffs of tulle flowing over the wide hoops , caught here and there with gleaming jet ornaments . Around her throat was a necklace of diamonds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She carried a large fan of black ostrich plumes . Eilley supposed the arrogant wench had ridden up in her lacquered brougham with the painted escutcheon on the panel . Eilley looked next at the pert and scornful Nita , a wench who was going to the dogs , it seemed to her , as fast as any girl could . Nita was gowned in delicate white Chantilly lace arranged on shimmering white satin over her hoops . Her bodice had slender silver ribbons tied in front , and streamers reaching to the hemline . She wore slippers of heavy white satin , and white lace mitts with a circular folding fan to match . Her black hair , parted in the middle , was done in the back in long curls that fell down her shoulders . She had a dainty necklace and a matching coronet of seed pearls . From the moment of Julia 's entrance the party was no longer Eilley 's . It was taken over at once by the mob that poured in . The tables were shoved to the walls , ten fiddlers sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Eilley , who refused to dance  | for a quadrille . Tom Peasley 's deep voice roared above the violins . When he called , men , acting wound up , but with barriers all around them , pranced in high glee , jigging round and round in frantic solo while trying to figure out what to do . " And gents come under And swing like thunder ! " Seizing partners , the men swung , and enormous skirts , pressed against legs in front , shot out behind , revealing colorful pantalettes and gay petticoats . " Swingum , kissum if you kin ! Grab and kissum while you 've gottum , Holdum to it if they kick ! ... " Aware that Mrs. Corey had been staring at her in pity and contempt , Eilley resolved to find her husband and go home , but Sandy had disappeared . John Mackay and Adolph Sutra and many of the other invited guests had left . The party had been taken over by gamblers and their whores ; and in wrathful majesty she swept out of the hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to shape it to her will was stronger than it had ever been  --  as was her resolve to make the trip to Europe and thus gain unapproachable prestige . Instead of turning home , she went to the graveyard where her son lay among the victims of Sam Brown and his kind , and the crushed and poisoned and drowned men who had died in dugouts and mines . With the large hoops of her skirt fencing her in , she sat by the grave ; and one by one she drew lilies from her corsage and set them above her child . He would not sleep here long among mounds that were lonely and forgotten . After she returned from Europe , she would lay him by her mansion in a garden of all lovely things that would grow there . Drawing the hoops close to her , she leaned forward and down and pressed her cheek to the grave . " My poor little baby ! " she whispered . " My poor little baby alone in the dark ! "  | CHAPTER XIII A FEW DAYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , and many persons came to the stage to see them off . Louisa Ellis was there , her thin face red from weeping ; and rowdies were there to shout warnings and advice . " Hi , Sandy , tell us all about it when you get back ! " " I will , " said Sandy , looking down at them and grinning . " I 'll tell you about the crops over yender . " " To hell with the crops ! We want a-know about them-there French gals . " " The Spanish gals , too , Sandy . You going to Spain ? " " I do n't know . Mebbe . We aim to go about everywheres . " " Crook your elbow for me on the Rue Montmartie ! " " What 's thet ? " " A street in Paris . Just grab me a French wife and ship her back . I 'll pay the freight . " " By God , ship us a whole boatload ! " A whip cracked above the blooded horses and the stage went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divide . It rolled past Eilley 's old cabin and down Gold Canyon , through the toll gate , and entered the valley ; and over against the Sierras she could see the spot where her mansion was being built . The coach climbed the Sierras and passed the high blue floor of Lake Tahoe , mountains black with pine and spruce , peaks bonneted with snow . It seemed funny to him , said Sandy , to be traveling west if Europe was east ; but he guessed it was all right . Eilley explained that unless they took a long overland journey by way of the Humboldt and Mormon trails , they had to go west until they found water . It would be quicker and easier this way . They would go to Sacramento and then by river-boat to San Francisco ; from there by ship to Panama ;  | then by pack-train across the mountains , and by ship again across the Gulf and to New York ; and at last over the broad Atlantic to England . " How fer is it ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy scowled at such incredible distance and settled back to doze ; and Eilley devoted herself to the babe on her lap . Theresa was a lovely child . Her eyes were violet , her hair was golden . She cooed at the landscape rolling by or nestled against her mother to suck her thumb . It was a long journey for one so small , but Eilley was determined to watch over her day and night ; and perhaps while she was away she would have a son and return to the mansion with two children . " How big , " asked Sandy , rousing himself , " is thet ship we 'll ride on ? " " From New York it will be a big ship . " " Oh , " he said , wondering about the breadth of the ocean and all the strange things he would see . He wished they could have gone by way of Missouri so they could visit his old home and his people ; but when he had once suggested it Eilley said Theresa could never stand a journey like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boats rocking like cradles . The stage coach , he decided , was rocking like that , and he peered round at his daughter to see if she was happy and well . " She likes to travel , " he said , wishing he could play with her . Eilley would never let him hold her , saying his hands were too rough and clumsy ; and the most he could do was to gurgle at her and make faces or touch her small pink hands . After they took a boat at Sacramento the going was easier . In San Francisco , Sandy gaped with amazement and said this town would be larger than Virginia City . Eilley was scornful of that . What was there here to make a great city ? It had no inexhaustible mines . It had only fog and a bay , and the waterfront roosts of gamblers and sea-faring men . It was , she declared , an abominable place . Sandy remembered a saloon where he and Luff McCoy had once been  | staggeringly drunk . His cough was worse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Eilley gave no heed . Nevertheless , after they were on a boat bound for Panama , she noticed how pale his face was and relented . " You 'd better go to the bar and have a drink . But only one . You 're starting a new life now . You 'll be a gentleman , and gentlemen do n't get drunk . " " I guess I know thet by now , " he said , and cooed at his daughter . When Eilley gave him a little rope , he always pretended he was in no hurry to be off . But if he ever needed a brandy in his life he needed it now  --  not for his cough , which the stuff made worse , but for his fright . He was in dread of Europe and its titled ladies and gentlemen . He was going over to get culture , a word Eilley had used so many times that it was now a part of his speech . Of what she meant by culture he had no notion . It was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing he could see . It was , of course , unrelated to mules and mule-skinners , to miners like Luff , to newspaper editors like Steve . It seemed to have no intimacy with brandy  --  but it did with lobster . He had asked Eilley which persons in Virginia City were cultured and which were not  --  and she had said none of them were . Adolph Sutro , she had said , had a little culture in him , but Steve Gilpin had absolutely none ; John Mackay had the makings of a gentleman in him , but not the Lord himself could ever make a gentleman of Luff McCoy . For Sandy it was all very baffling . Steve read every book he could get hold of  --  and Eilley somehow related books to culture . Old Pancake spoke in highsounding phrases  --  and Eilley said a gentleman could often be told by his speech . Sutro , nevertheless , sometimes fell into a jargon nobody could understand , and John Mackay never spoke of books . By the time he had downed his fourth brandy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture was so much nonsense . One thing was certain : he loathed narrow shoes that pinched his feet , high pointed collars that gouged his chin , broadcloth suits that wrinkled when a man sat down ; and if these were a part of culture , he doubted he could ever be the kind of gentleman  | Eilley admired . He liked clothes on which spots and stains made no difference . He liked to stretch out on the earth , when the fancy took him , and sun himself ; or crawl into bed with his socks on ; or wipe his nose on his shirt sleeve . He liked to go to sleep between two mule blankets and smell the fine healthy smell of beasts . But all those things , and a great deal more , were no part of culture , or of his life that was now to be . Now he had to learn to read and write , though for more than twenty-five years he had lived happily without doing either . Now , it seemed , he had to go about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had to meet ladies and gentlemen and talk only of what they had on their minds . By the time he reached his seventh brandy he felt dizzy and frightened , and wished he were back in those years when he was a penniless nobody in unclean clothes . " The first thing you 've got to do , " said Eilley the next day , " is to learn to write your name . You will have to sign lots of important documents . " Sandy had a headache . He had drunk so much brandy he was ill all night ; and today he was seasick . On a sheet of paper Eilley had written lemuel and she said it was his first name . He peered at it but it was only pencil marks . Then she wrote sanford and bowers . He pointed to a letter and asked : " Ai n't thet a o ? " " Yes , that 's o . " " I think I'n make thet . " He took the pen and drew a circle as large as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're generous , but you do n't have to make them so big . "  | With patience and determination Eilley continued to instruct Sandy in the mysteries of the alphabet . But it was uphill going . From one day to the next Sandy seemed to forget what he had learned , and the same ground had to be gone over many times . During the arduous overland journey across the isthmus there was no opportunity for lessons , and when they were finally resumed it was only to have them interrupted again while crossing the Gulf . Theresa became ill . For many days the pink faded visibly from her cheeks . Eilley was deeply troubled but said the child would be all right when she got on a larger boat . In New York they embarked on the Caledonia and had one of the largest cabins on the ship . It was a clean sturdy boat that rode the ocean like a thoroughbred ; but Theresa did not improve . What the child 's illness was Eilley could not imagine . The ship 's doctor said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in altitude and climate . In England she would need a long rest . Eilley nursed this child with the same devotion she had lavished on her first-born . Her baby 's two violet eyes were like two fading flowers ; her body had become little more than skin and bones . Eilley remained in the cabin and had food sent there , but Sandy roamed the ship 's decks , his wonder feeding on everything he saw . Never , he confided to strangers , had he known the ocean was such a big thing . A man traveled day and night  --  and was the captain sure they were going in a straight line ? Perhaps he was running around in circles out here in a patch of water . Again and again he went over to stare at the wake to assure himself that the ship was moving ; but it seemed unreasonable for an ocean to be so broad and changeless . It was always the same , a rolling prairie of green or blue without an island anywhere . " You 'd think we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin to speak to his wife . " Mr. Bowers , " said Eilley , " our child is very sick . " " I know it , " he said , and looked at the delicate face of his daughter . " The doctor , he said she 'd be all right in England . "  | " England is a long way from here . " Eilley felt frenzied . Was God going to blight all her children ? What was the strange sickness that wasted them to skin and bone as if time fed invisibly on their flesh ? The doctor said she was weak from travel and would soon be all right . Eilley knew better than that . She knew that her second child was slowly dying ; and when she could no longer deny the evidence of it , she almost went to pieces . She was more like a demented creature than the calm and level-headed wife Sandy had known . She did not weep but she made terrible inhuman sounds of grief that chilled him . Like a woman hugging an armful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it , making those dry choked sounds . It was more than Sandy could bear to look at . He felt limp and helpless and terrified . Going on deck , he kept asking people how long it would be before the ship reached England ; and then he went to the bar and drank . After a while he would go back to the cabin and peer in ; and upon seeing Eilley there , rocking the child , moaning over it in hideous lamentation , he would return to the bar and drink again . He drank enough brandy to kill a man , but it had no power to blot out the dreadful picture of his wife and child . No matter where he went , he could still hear the sound of her wordless anguish and see the strange passion in her face . It was all too terrible to think of . So it was that the days went by , and at last the men who drank with him and let him pay the bills said they were approaching England ; but Sandy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cheering and he rushed down to tell Eilley ; but at the door he stopped as if a hand had seized him . Something had happened , and he knew only too well what it was , though how he knew it he could not have told . Slowly , with constricted heart and limbs , he entered the cabin . Eilley still sat and rocked the child . She was not moaning now . She rocked like a mechanical thing , as if the movement of the ship moved her also ; and she bowed low and pressed her face to Theresa . Sandy knew that his daughter was dead . He stood for a long moment staring at a mother who again looked as if she were trying to warm a dead  | thing back to life ; and big tears rolled down his cheeks . Big tears hung in his thin beard ; and looking down across his face he saw them and wondered about them , and hoped vaguely that they would not stain his clothes . Then he moved backwards as if shoved by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to the bar and drank , but he could feel only pain . Down below , in the darkness of their cabin , Eilley sat for hours , holding the dead child in her arms . When at last he went to her , she was so hushed and unmoving that for a moment he thought she too was dead ; and when later the child was taken from her , she spoke only once . Her baby , she said , was to be prepared for shipment back home ; and after that she did not speak again before the boat touched England . Like a woman from whom the soul had been withdrawn , she left the ship with Sandy at her side and journeyed to a London hotel ; and there , in a dank and cheerless room , she sat for a long while without stirring . Sandy was baffled and frightened . He would speak to her , saying she should eat now , saying it was time she slept ; but she seemed not to hear . She was a stranger to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became aware of his problem and knocked gently on the door to inquire if they could be of any use . " I guess not , " Sandy would say . He thought he would starve to death . He did not dare leave her ; he did not know that he could have had food sent up . Hour after hour , day and night , he sat in the chilly room , looking at her from time to time , sighing and waiting . For forty-eight hours she did not leave her chair . She did not speak . Sandy dozed and was awakened by terrible dreams ; but he knew that Eilley had not slept . He began to wonder how long she would sit there and if she would die without moving or speaking again . On the third day Eilley stirred . She rose and looked from a window as if to discover where she was . She did not speak . She went to the bed and lay down on it and in a little while she slept ; and all night she talked unintelligibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare at her hopefully and listen , but there was no sense in her dark mutterings . The next morning she ate a little breakfast , and while eating she looked at him . " We 'll go out today , " she announced calmly , " and buy some furniture . " He could have shouted for joy . He wanted to hug her and say everything was all right now ; but he dared not do that . He did put on his stiffest collar and his most punishing shoes . Eilley was not by any means her old self . He realized that . But she had spoken ; and the fact that she was going to buy furniture showed that she was no longer daft . " I 'm ready , " he announced at last , standing eagerly before her with a figure-eight knot in his tie . " Bend down , " Eilley said . He stooped , and Eilley fixed his black silk tie in a neat little bow . Then she gave him a long and steady look of appraisal . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though pronouncing judgment on a small boy . " You 'd better go wash your face . " '  | CHAPTER XI V N THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED , EILLEY WAS A VERY BUSY WOMAN . She liked English furniture , she said , because it was heavy and durable ; and she bought whatever she took a fancy to and had it crated and shipped . Then she ran up to Scotland to see the home folks and left them speechless with her gifts , and with her story of the new world where mountains were made of silver and streams were floored with gold . But uppermost in her mind all the while was a wish to see the Queen . Just how a stranger got to see Victoria she did not know . At her London hotel she made inquiries that were not discreet ; and persons there , looking pained and incredulous , suggested the American legation ; and there she found a young American who also looked pained . He said she would have to see the American minister . With Sandy following , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Charles Francis Adams , who , an underling said , was very busy . " I am Mrs. Lemuel Bowers of Virginia City . Tell Mr. Adams " May I ask what you wish to see Mr. Adams about ? " " I want to make arrangements to visit the Queen . " The young man stiffened as if she had struck him with a mulewhip . He looked Mr. Bowers up and down ; and while his cynical face was recording astonishment and distaste , Sandy said : " We own the biggest mine in the world . " " Indeed . In Virginia City ? Silver , is it not ? " " Enough coin , " said Sandy , " to buy England . " " That , " said the man with a pained smile , " would be quite a sum . " " It 's ther , all right . Ther 's whole mountains of it . " " Indeed . " He was gazing at Eilley 's cloak . It was an Algerian  | burnoose with an attached hood , and it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be possible for you to see one of the secretaries of the legation . If you will wait ? ? " Eilley waited a long while before she was ushered into another office . The man who received them was tall and thin and glacial . His hands were long and pale  --  and his voice was like his hands , a high colorless voice with an English accent . " What can I do for you ? " he asked , bowing like a tall flexible icicle . " You can make arrangements for us to visit the Queen . " There was no change in his face . His cold eyes were studying them , discreetly , politely . " I doubt , " he said at last , " that her Majesty is receiving at present . Do you expect to be in England long ? " Eilley drew an impatient breath . " Only long enough to see the Queen . We have to go on to Paris . " " It is possible , " said the man with anemic courtesy , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Italy we are going home . " " If you return later , " said the voice that never changed its pace or tone because of interruptions , " it is barely possible ? " " But we are not sure we 'll come back to England . " " We got a-get home , " said Sandy . " Thet mine of ourn , we should be ther to oversee things . " An alert observer might have sensed that the man had found the clue that he was looking for . But it was still the same impassive face , the same politeness without warmth or color . He rose and bowed . " I am afraid , Mrs. Bowers , that I can do nothing for you . Good morning . " Eilley was too dumfounded to speak . She allowed herself to be ushered out , and not until she reached the street did she find her voice . " The fool ! " she said . " What does the Government pay him for ? " She was marching toward her hotel . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a kind of kingdom in her own right , should be herded to the street by office underlings.  | Again she made inquiries but was soon convinced that both English and Americans were making a fool of her . They lied to her . And at last she was tired of the whole business and cried out angrily : " We 're going to Paris ! " " But we got a-see the Queen . What will the home folks say ? " " Never mind them . " " But they 'll ask us the first thing , did we see the Queen . " " We 'll say we did . " " Thet , " said Sandy , " would be a lie . " " Sometimes , " said Eilley , " it 's better to lie than be laughed at . Now , Mr. Bowers , I do n't want to hear any more about it . Go pack our things . " After a moment she added : " We 'll see the Empress . " But trying to see Eugenie turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the American legation in Paris there was the same sterile and blighting politeness . After failing to get past sentinels in the outer offices , Eilley would leave in disgust and spend extravagantly in the Paris shops . Paris shopkeepers  --  the ones who spoke English , at least  --  were more arrogant than those in London ; but after she showed her letters of credit they suddenly became insufferably polite . Then , indeed , they bowed and fawned themselves silly . After several humiliations Eilley began to enjoy melting arrogant men into limp and trotting mannikins . She would enter a shop and say she wanted to buy something very expensive  --  a diamond necklace or a gown or a piece of bric-a-brac ; and when the indignant shopkeeper tried to dismiss her she would argue with him . She would tell him to wrap the object and ship it to Virginia City in the United States . Thinking her mad or penniless or both , the shopkeeper would back away and Eilley would follow him , making demands , and asking for a half-dozen other costly items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to call the police , she would open her purse and shake in his face a letter of credit for seventy thousand dollars . Then the tables turned . While he purred with apologies and flatteries , she grew furious ; she scorned his apologies ; she said he was a vulgar knave and she would go elsewhere . Then she would march to the door with the abject fellow trotting  | behind , and apologizing in both French and English . If she really wanted the object , she would relent at last and buy it , though not without making the wretched man feel that he sold only trinkets unworthy of her . With all the cunning she had , she would make him feel utterly base and stupid . Sandy was amazed by all this , and not for several days did he know that Eilley was acting a part . He was never to know that she acted the part because she had been scorned at the legations . After learning that Eilley summoned these tantrums at will , he gaped with admiration and followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scene , when the shopkeeper himself was the angry and abusive one , he felt a little angered and very frightened ; for they were in a strange land and policemen might throw them into jail . But when the scene changed , and Eilley chilled with magnificent scorn and rebuke , Sandy 's limp emotions stiffened and he became bold and angry , forgetting that he was only a witness to an idle show . Eilley knew why she was acting a part . She knew she was taking vengeance on arrogant strangers for the outrages she had suffered ; and she felt refreshed and enlivened after each scene was done . Having been told that the world 's most famous silversmith was in Paris , she found his shop and marched in . He could not speak English but he had an attendant who could , and this man acted as translator . When Eilley began explaining what she wanted , and the assistant retold it in French , the stiff-necked silversmith kept shrugging and spreading his palms , and he turned to look at Eilley as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . " Tell him , " Eilley went on , " that I am building a mansion , and I want solid silver doorknobs , and a solid silver table service ; and I want them made out of silver from my own mine ; and I want the most fashionable things he can make , the best in the world . " When this extraordinary order was communicated to him , the silversmith looked ill . He exploded in a tirade of unintelligible French .  | " He says , " explained the attendant , " that he does n't make art for peasants or fools . " " Oh , so he says that , does he ? Well , tell him I want pure silver for my mansion  --  forty forks and forty spoons and knives , and plates and bowls and all the dishes I need to serve forty guests ; and tell him they are to be the best and he is to spare no expense . Tell him these are for the finest mansion in the New World , and important people will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " While this was translated , the silversmith shrugged repeatedly , and the small mustache on his lip twitched with incredulous scorn . " He says that what you ask for would cost a great deal and he has no time to talk to you . " " Tell him it is all to be made of silver from my own mine . Say I will have the bullion shipped to him . " " Madam , he says you are crazy . " " Tell him ? " " He asks you to leave ? " " Tell him , " said Eilley imperturbably , " that I want his very best workmanship , the very finest he can make  --  better than anything he ever made for a queen or a princess . " " Madam ? " " And tell him I want it all delivered by next summer . " The silversmith finally lost his temper . He began to gesticulate as if Eilley had driven him mad . He yelled insults in French ; he talked with both hands , palms spread upward ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook his finger in his face and said something very loud and very emphatic . " He says if you do not leave at once he will call the police ! " Eilley 's moment had come . Without unladylike haste she handed the assistant a letter of credit for seventy-nine thousand dollars , and that astounded gentleman broke into voluble French . He rushed with it to the silversmith , who stood for a long moment as if paralyzed . Then he came to life with spasmodic jerks and twitchings that made him look like a mechanical toy . He came over to Eilley , his face honeyed with apology , his eyes beseeching her understanding ;  | but Eilley was now an indignant woman . Grasping the letter , she headed in terrible majesty for the door , with the silversmith clutching her arm and the translator dashing in front of her as if to lock her in . One was crying apologies in French and the other in English . Eilley stopped and looked haughtily at the ridiculous fellows ; but she wanted to laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that he is a vulgar fool . I come here to place an order and he insults me . Tell him that in the United States we horsewhip such men . " The assistant , she knew very well , did not tell his master all that ; but he did tell him enough to make the man 's bows twice as nimble , and his face a picture of supplication and regret . " Madam , he is deeply sorry . He begs you to understand . So many Americans come here " What " What is wrong with Americans ? " " They have the coin , " said Sandy . " Thet 's what counts . " " Madam , Americans are very fine people . You do n't understand . Monsieur is a very famous silversmith ; he makes artwork for ladies " Does n't he think I 'm a lady ? Ask him ! " When the translator hesitated , she repeated the demand ; and apparently the question was asked . The silversmith 's chattering French rose in tone and volume ; his bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady and he begs you to accept his profoundest apologies . His opinion of you is so high that he will make anything you wish . He will devote himself entirely to your wishes for as long as you require ; and if you will send the bullion from your mine ? " After several minutes , during which both men wore themselves out with apologetic obeisance , Eilley softened a little ; but she did not allow them to think she had forgiven them . Again she told what she wanted ; and while she spoke to the assistant , he talked in French to the smith , and with foolish smiles and nods he wrote everything down . The cost would be fifteen thousand dollars  --  if she furnished the silver . Eilley said she would pay them tomorrow ,  | and would have the bullion shipped at once . They followed her to the door , bowing , murmuring , smiling ; and after she had gone half a block she turned and saw both of them staring after her . Sandy was a little distressed by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seemed to him the last reach of extravagance ; but Eilley had come to Europe to spend money and she spent it . She spent other thousands for gowns and jewelry , drapes and curtains , clocks , plate glass , lighting fixtures , mantlepieces , statues , and whatever else caught her fancy . Parisian shopkeepers had served wealthy Americans before , but none so prodigal as this Mrs. Bowers from a place called Virginia City . If a coronet or brooch or necklace cost five thousand dollars and she wanted it , she bought it and never haggled about the price ; and if the jeweler had asked twice or three times as much , she would have paid it without a murmur . For some stupid reason , though , she had been unable to see Eugenie and Napoleon , and in vengeance she wanted to buy all the treasures in Paris and take them home with her . After she had been several weeks there , and had spent more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars , she took Sandy to Italy . Finding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself and her husband ; and when these were finished and shipped , she went on another spending spree . Across England , France , and Italy she had left a broad trail of silver ; and by the ton her purchases had been wrapped and crated and shipped to the Bowers Mansion , Virginia City , U.S.A. Now and then she paused to consider her further needs . One by one , she would go in mental pilgrimage through the rooms of her mansion , remembering what she had bought for each , trying to foresee what else they should have ; but at last the day came when she said to her travel-weary husband : " I guess that 's about everything . Is there anything you want ? " Sandy looked back over their path , along which they had strewn nearly a quarter of a million dollars , and said there was nothing . He already had enough pipes of all kinds to fill a trunk . He had tobacco pouches and jars by the dozen . He had enough clothes ,  | it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as well as studs and cuff-links , watch chains and fobs and charms , umbrellas and canes , finger rings  --  and even an eyeglass with a ribbon . " Ther ai n't a thing , " he said humbly . In an Italian city Sandy had seen some boots that pleased him . They were tall , they were scrolled with fancy designs , they had tassels ; but they were not , he supposed , a sensible thing for a gentleman 's wardrobe . " No , " he said , " I guess we bought about all we need . " " Then we 'll go home , " Eilley announced . " Our mansion will be done by now . " Back in England , Eilley gathered various plants , including ivy , to set in her mansion gardens ; she made arrangements to have the coffin of her infant daughter removed from the vault and shipped ; and at Liverpool they embarked on the Persia . From the deck Sandy looked back at the land he was leaving . Europe was a great country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and a man could spend a lot of coin there ; but he was glad to see the last of it . He was glad to be done with gilded gentlemen and ladies who had made him feel like a worm . He was especially glad to be out of France and Italy , where the unintelligible talk had made him feel feverish , and silly folk drank wine instead of brandy . There was brandy on this ship , he supposed , and in haste he went in search of a bar . Eilley , too , was glad to be on her way home . No queen in any land had received her ; and as for the American legations , she despised all of them . They were staffed with arrogant hirelings without a country , lost midway between a president and a king . She loathed the memory of fawning shopkeepers . Above all else she hated the vigilant efforts with which all Europe conspired to keep every person at the social level where he was born . In the American West , she now realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and cherish . Because , when all was said and done , she was only the daughter of peasants , yet back in Virginia City she would now be a great lady , and the distinguished from all fields would  | come to her door . This spirit was called democracy . After months in Europe , she decided that democracy was a splendid thing . She became aware , indeed , that she was eager for sight of the American flag . She wanted to be back home , with the mighty Sierras for a backyard , and the broad Nevada desert rolling away from her door . There a humble person could rise and be one among the great . There she , without throne or crown , would be queen of two cities , and the guiding spirit of a state .  | CHAPTER XV O THEIR SECOND DAY OUT , EILLEY 'S ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO A poorly dressed young woman who looked friendless and scared and far advanced in pregnancy ; and she became curious about her . Eilley had been interested in every pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enough to sidetrack all other interests ; to set her to thinking , " There is a lucky woman who will soon have a child , and it will be healthy and strong ; it will live ; it will be one of several children . This woman has no silver mine , but she is more blessed by God than I am ... : ' Her heart was warmed toward the girl because she was so young and unhappy and seemed to be going alone to a strange land . On the third morning out she sat by her and spoke . " You do n't seem to have any friends on the ship . " " I haw n't a one , " said the girl . " You 're going to New York ? Have you any friends there ? " " I do n't know . " " You must have , " said Eilley , " or you would n't be going . " She was a strange and morbid girl with large dark eyes and a small mouth . She looked sick . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you a husband in New York ? " " No Eilley wondered if the girl had a husband anywhere . " What is your name ? " " You can call me Margaret . " " Margaret , I 'm Mrs. Lemuel Bowers of Virginia City . I 'd like to be your friend . " " My friend ? " said the girl . Her pale mouth curled with scorn . " I haw n't no friends . "  | " Now you have one friend , " said Eilley cheerfully . The next day she talked to the girl again , trying to draw from her the story of her life ; but Margaret was almost as reticent as an Indian . Of her past life in England she refused to say a word ; of certain distant relatives in New York she said only that they had gone there long ago and she hoped to find them . Her bitter face would soften a little when Eilley spoke of her mine , of her mansion , of all the things she had bought in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , the girl looked terrified . " How soon is it to be ? " asked Eilley . " You mean the baby ? I do n't know . " Eilley then spoke of her own children , both dead , but Margaret did not wish to talk about children . Every allusion to her unborn babe made her sullen and fearful . Perhaps , Eilley reflected , the child was a bastard and the wretched girl hated it . She seemed to be rather stupid . When she spoke , her voice was muffled as if she were afraid of its sound ; and when she looked about her at other persons , her eyes were dull and resentful . Eilley invited her to the cabin but the girl refused to go . All day I she sat on deck , staring at the ocean ; and nobody except Eilley seemed ever to speak to her . Now and then Sandy came by and paused to look at the shabby creature . She was , he told himself , a queer duck , sitting there day after day like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Eilley spent so much time with her . Sandy was having fun on this ship . There were several gentlemen who were glad to listen to him as long as he paid for the drinks . His pockets were full of money and he was glad to pay . He told them of the tons of stuff they had bought and shipped home ; of their mine which was now paying them a hundred thousand dollars a month ; of his years as a mule-skinner in Missouri and the West ; of his friends , Luff and Steve and John Mackay . Sometimes he listened while the gentlemen talked of the war and the slaves and the unfriendly interference of England . England , they all said , was an old bitch of a nation who was everlastingly sticking her imperial nose into the affairs of others . She now hoped the Southern States would  | win so that America would be divided against itself . She did not want the United States to become a first-class power . " She wants to be the mother of all nations ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sow that feeds on her litters ! " Sandy had little interest in all that . When the opportunity came he ordered the glasses filled again and fetched the talk back to his amazing luck out in Nevada . He had been afraid Eilley would try to teach him to write on the way home ; he was glad she had found the Margaret girl . He was glad that on this homeward journey she paid little attention to what he wore . But he was a little troubled , nevertheless , by the way Eilley devoted herself to a silly stranger in a calico dress . He could see no sense in that  --  and a few days later he was astounded by the outcome . He entered their cabin to find Eilley hugging a sickly infant to her breast and talking to the ship 's captain . That was just the way , he remembered , that Eilley had hugged her own babies . " If I can depend on you to do that , " the captain was saying , " it will be the best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Eilley replied . " She gave you the names and told you where to find these people ? " " Yes . " " It will be very kind of you , Mrs. Bowers . " " I 'll be glad to do it . " " Then , " said the captain , " we 'll regard the matter as settled . " After he had gone , Sandy looked at his wife and the child and wondered what on earth had happened . For a long moment Eilley seemed unaware of him . She rocked the babe and cooed over it , murmured tender silliness in its ears , patted its scrawny little feet , or bent low to kiss its wrinkled skull . Sandy was afraid she had gone daft again . She was the craziest woman over babies he had ever heard of  --  and over any baby , it now seemed . " Eilley ? " " Yes ? " said Eilley in the strange other-world voice she had when hugging a child .  | " Is that Margaret 's baby ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered those days of bitter grief in the London hotel . " It is hers , ai n't it ? " he repeated . " Of course . " " Gosh ! " he said , feeling that there was still some mystery here . " Where is Margaret ? " " Dead . " The word overwhelmed him . He had not known this girl , but her death filled him with a nameless pity . He sank to a chair and was silent . And all the while Eilley hugged the motherless infant as if trying to absorb it into her own being . She kissed it with such hunger , such intense rapture , that he was filled with pain . The scene became more than he could endure . He turned quietly and left . That evening , in a voice so secretive it almost whispered , she said something to Sandy that left him speechless . The captain , she said , had entrusted the child to her , and she had promised to try to find its people in New York . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used when gazing far into the future , " I know I 'll never be able to find them . God has given this child to us . " In astonishment , Sandy pondered that . Then he went to the crib that the captain had provided and looked down at the sleeping child ; and Eilley came over and stood by him . " It 's ours , " she said . " But , Eilley " " It 's ours . Her name is Margaret Persia . " " That 's a funny name . " " Just before she died , her mother- asked me to call her Margaret . I 've also named her Persia  --  for it was on this ship that God sent her to us . We 'll call her Persia . " " But she ai n't ourn , " said Sandy . " Persia , " Eilley went on , " is a nice distinguished name . Margaret Persia Bowers . " " But ? " said Sandy . He looked at his wife and knew it was useless to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , and bent low to kiss the child . When she arrived in New York , hugging Persia to her breast , she knew that the search for the child 's relatives would be futile . The few vague directions the dying mother had given her would be of little help , and Eilley had already forgotten most of them anyway . Her love of this homeless infant was so fiercely possessive that she would not have given it up if all its kinfolk in the world had marched in to claim it . Twice she left it with a nurse in her hotel room and went out , she told Sandy , to look for the relatives ; but she only stared at a few shop windows and hastened back . Why , she asked herself angrily , should she try to find relatives who did not want it and would abuse it ? They would bring it up in ignorance and poverty ; she would give it a splendid home . She would love it as she had loved John and Theresa . Finally , one morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've looked everywhere , " she said , but she did not meet Sandy 's gaze . " I 've hunted high and low . " Sandy had been thinking of the matter . " What 's her last name ? " he asked . " Wixson , " said Eilley . The name slipped out , and immediately she was sorry . " Ther 's a big book thet 's got about all the names in . " He went out to fetch a directory . " Look , " he said , " and see if it 's in ther . " Eilley was angry but she turned to the W 's . There was a Wixson , but she lied and said there was none . " There are lots of Wilsons , " she said . " Mebbe it 's Wilson . " " Oh , nonsense ! Next you 'll be telling me it 's O'Rooney or Montague ! " " I just had a feelun it might be Wilson . " " I tell you no ! She 's our baby now . " Eilley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print that she packed in haste , and they took a boat for Panama . Once in Nevada , no Wixson on earth would ever find her .  | " When we get home , " she told Sandy , " folks will think it 's our child . We 'll just let them think that " Sandy agreed , but he was still troubled . He was prepared to love the child almost with Eilley 's devotion ; but he could n't help feeling that they were thieves . On a ship they had picked up a baby and now they were taking it thousands of miles from its own people . That was hardly right . His sense of guilt so distressed him that he went to the bar ; but by the time he had reached his fourth glass , he remembered that Eilley had a gift of second sight . If she said it was an honorable thing to do , then it must be , and he would worry no more about it . On the long journey home Eilley never let Persia out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods which doctors in New York had recommended ; and all night she seemed to lie awake . At any sound from Persia she would leap out of bed ; and then in the gloom until morning came , Sandy could see her rocking the babe in her arms and murmuring to it . He began to feel a little cheated and shut out . But if Sandy Bowers was unhappy , it was chiefly because he dreaded the mansion and the return home . Eilley had told him in England , while buying fashionable clothes for him , that when they returned to Nevada he would be a gentleman and would have to dress like one . She meant , he supposed , that he must always wear shoes that pinched his corns , stiff wing collars that gouged his chin , and a coat that laced him in like a mule cinched under a packsaddle . He must eat without soiling his clothes or his hands ; he must bathe and put on a spotless nightshirt before he slept . Rather than be a life-long slave to all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions ; and by the time they reached San Francisco he was in a mood to get hell-roaringly drunk . Eilley said she had thought of a few more things she needed for the mansion , including books  --  and the mention of books set him off . She hired a carriage and drove away with Persia in her arms , and Sandy went in haste to the waterfront tavern where he had once caroused with Luff McCoy . When he entered , dressed in finest  | broadcloth in the height of fashion , with a flower in his buttonhole , an onyx-headed cane on his arm , a gray beaver stovepipe on his head , the tavern rowdies made way for him . His inner coat pocket was stuffed with banknotes . He marched over and told the barkeeper to set them up . " Fer the hull house , " he said . The owners of this saloon were two fat Irishmen whom Sandy had known slightly in the old days . They sat by him now and asked questions . " Remember me ? Bill O'Brien is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know . I just come from Yoorup . " " Yoorup ! What in hell you been doing over there ? " " Gettun a lot of stuff fer our mansion . We got a mansion now . " All the men in the tavern gathered round to drink and to stare at Sandy 's high-falutin clothes . " I 'm Jim Flood , " said the other Irishman . " Is John Mackay still over in them parts ? " " He was when I left . " " What 's he doing ? " " Workun in the Kentuck . " " Do n't he own no mine yet ? " " Nery a thing I know about . " Sandy dragged forth his roll of banknotes . " Just set a dozen your best bottles out  --  brandy , whisky , champagne , the whole works . " Soon the tavern was full of men . Spendthrift angels from Virginia City did not often come here . " What did you see over there ? " asked Bill . " Where 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you see Benecia Boy ? " " Nope . " " Did you see Queen Victoria ? " Sandy hesitated . He was not an artful or even a willing liar . " Yes , " he said , believing Eilley would wish him to say that . " The hell you did ! What did the old gal have to say ? "  | " Not much . Her husbun or somebody , he had died , and she was all dressed in black . " " Did you go to Ireland ? " asked Flood . " No . My wife  --  Mrs. Bowers , thet is  --  she do n't like the Irish . " " The hell she do n't ! By God , they 're the best people on earth . Why do n't your missus like the Irish ? " " I do n't know . Mrs. Bowers , she 's Scotch ; but I 'm Scotch , too , and all my best friends is Irish . John Mackay , he is , and Luff McCoy ; Steve Gilpin , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glib and bold . He tore the collar from his throat . A gold button fell to the floor . When a man picked it up and offered it to him , he said : " You keep it . I got a hull bucketful of them things . " This turned out to be the only real spree Sandy had known since he met Eilley . All night he set the drinks up and abused his clothes and boasted of his trip abroad ; and when he returned to his wife at daylight he was a sorry sight . His roll of banknotes was gone . His collar and diamond stud , his tie and hat and cane were gone . And he was drunk and sleepy and full of shame . " Mr. Bowers , what on earth you been doing ? " " I just been out and around . " " Look at your clothes ! " Sandy looked down at his clothes and was secretly glad . There was n't much culture in them now . " Do you realize you left your wife and baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you ? " " I 'm sorry about thet , " he murmured contritely . " What was the matter with you ? " " Well , Eilley , I guess I was all-fired glad to be a-comun home and all , and to see the mansion and all the stuff we bought , and ? " " Is this the way to be a gentleman ? " " No . Thet was n't no fit way to act . " " All day yesterday I bought books for us , a big fine library where you can sit in the evenings and read ; and you go out and drink like a horse ! "  | He shuddered at the thought of sitting with books all around him . " It was my cough , " he said . " Look at your suit  --  and one of your very nicest ones . " " I got a lot more , " he said . " I guess I must a-fell down . " Eilley told him to bathe and change ; for they were going home and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British earl . They were going home to take their place as the business and social leaders of Nevada . He must remember that . They had been to Europe ; they would live in a mansion ; they would entertain distinguished persons from far places . Those were things to keep in mind . If he staggered around with drunken cronies he would destroy faith in himself , and the men of Virginia City and Gold Hill would not turn to him for leadership . " When a person is rich , " said Eilley , while they were going upstream to Sacramento , " he has responsibilities . He has to be a leader that folks respect and look up to . That 's why we went to Europe . Now we have to take our rightful place . " " Yes , " he said dutifully . He had on a low collar with a big soft tie that was like a yard of ribbon , and he could let his chin sag into the silken nest . His shoes were more comfortable than those he had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic sides and did not pack his toes together like crowded teeth . He was puffing on a big fragrant cigar . Eilley had told him that cigars were more dignified than the pipes he liked to suck on . " In Virginia City , " she was saying , " lots of persons will want to rule and say what should be done . It is n't going to be easy for us to take our rightful places . There 'll be women like Mrs. Corey who 'll want to set the styles and lord it over us . There 'll be men who will try and push you aside . But we wo n't let anyone push us aside . " " I know thet , " he said , staring at the band on his cigar . " Thet Sutro , mebbe he 'll want a-be the boss . " " Do n't fret about him . He 'll spend his life digging a hole . It 's men like John Mackay to worry about . " " I seen two of his friends  --  Bill O'Brien and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted to know what John Mackay is up to . " " You keep your eye on men like Mackay . You handle the men , Mr. Bowers , and I 'll handle the women . " Sandy felt no more able to handle the men than to dig with a pick the tunnel Sutro dreamed of ; but he said he would do his best . He felt a little more worldly , a little more like a man , since his trip to Europe . He puffed his cigar and gazed thoughtfully at other cigars in his coat pocket . Eilley had said they might establish a bank ; and if there were a bank he would be its president and he would have to see that it was kept full of coin . Remembering now that he was to handle the men , he threw his soggy cigar into the river and said : " Fred Grebe , I 'd best fire him . " " Why ? " " The men do n't like him . He ai n't honest . " " He always seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says Fred is a skunk . " " A lot he knows about it ! Luff McCoy is just a good-for-nothing . It seems to me , Mr. Bowers , that the time has come to stop associating with men like that . " " He 's my friend . " " Mr. Bowers , do you think you can be a leader in society and choose your friends from saloons ? " When shoved to a wall , there was ugly Scotch obstinacy in Sandy Bowers . " If to be rich means I got a-give up my friends , then I do n't want a-be rich . " Eilley knew of his stubbornness . She also knew how to handle it . " Of course Luff is a nice man in some ways , but he is n't like you . He does n't have any ambition . " " Thet 's true , " Sandy admitted . " Luff wo n't ever be more than he is now  --  just a fat lazy drunkard . Mr. Bowers , let me ask you something . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table for dinner , would you like to introduce him to men like Luff , or to important men like yourself ? "  | " Well ? " " Give me your honest answer . " Sandy reached for a fresh Havana . He turned it over and over , thinking of men like Luff McCoy and of important men like himself . He had never dreamed that the President would come to his table for dinner . " I guess , " he said at last , " I ai n't never thought of it like thet. "  | CHAPTER XVI WORKING CONDITIONS IN THE BOWERS MINE WERE NO DIFFERENT from those in any other ; and for Luff McCoy they were plain hell . In the foul and poisonous gloom men labored , naked to their waists , with sweat like melting lard on their bodies . Their faces were blackened from the smoke of blasting , their hair was matted , the leather of their boots was wet from the water running down their legs . They were only the beasts of labor , bent over pick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and living from day to day in dread of a deluge of water or an avalanche of stone . They were only a part of the machinery , one with the wheelbarrows and cables , cages and lifts . One day when Fred Grebe , the sly and brutal superintendent , came underground , Luff spoke to him . Why , he asked , did n't the owners get behind Sutro and help him dig a tunnel ? The sumps had scum on them a foot deep ; even the rats died in the poisonous air . A tunnel would ventilate the mines and let the water flow out ; and the men would not be drowned or blown to pieces or buried alive . " This is a good mine , " said Grebe . " Twice as many men is killed in the Potosi or Gould and Curry or the Kentuck . " " But we need a tunnel  --  a tunnel to carry the water , a railroad to haul the ore , and fresh air coming in to blow the gases up the shafts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . We 're taking out five thousand dollars a day . " " Five thousand a day ! " cried an angry miner . " Five thousand a day to send to them Bowers people while they visit queens and we work for four dollars a day and get killed ! "  | " If you do n't like it down here , " said Grebe , " you'n get you a job somewhere else . It 's my job to get the ore to the mills . " It was not the labor that irked Luff McCoy , or the miser 's wage ; it was the vision of death in horrible ways . Twice within the first week after Eilley 's departure he had seen death strike in her mine . The first blow came in an afternoon . Powder monkeys were sinking a shaft while Luff and others assisted . They drilled and charged four holes to fire at once , and then pulled the bell-rope for the cage . When it came down , they lit the fuses and yanked the rope once as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They signaled again and again , and watched the sputtering fuses . " Something is wrong up there ! " a man yelled , and yanked the rope . Realizing that soon they would be trapped , a man dashed to the fuses to snuff them out . Two of them he tore away but the other two had burned into stone beyond his reach . " Look out ! " he cried . One of the men was still desperately yanking at the signal rope . Other men leapt to the farthest wall and threw themselves flat on the stone floor . Two men started to climb the cables and timbers , going hand over hand like desperate monkeys ; and Luff called to them to come down . The man who had snuffed the fuses sat as if paralyzed . " God ! " he said , but he did not move . Like a man chained to the spot and fascinated by the horror of his predicament , he looked at the two fuses burning deep into stone . The two men were still climbing . Luff among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . And then the explosion came  --  a deafening belch of sound and thousands of flying stone bullets . The rock erupted in one mighty blast of thunder ; then there was a chamber filled with smoke and silence . Luff remained still , wondering if there was a delayed fuse ; but at last he rose and peered into the gloom . Others joined him but one who had hugged the floor did not move . The men went over and looked up the smokefilled shaft . One of the two climbing men had fallen , riddled by bullets of stone ; the other hung there in the shaft ,  | impaled on a stout splinter that had been ripped half the length of a log . Of the man who had sat paralyzed by the fuses there was not a trace anywhere , nor did they ever find any . " Well , " said Luff , " that got at least four of us . " Another man was invoking the wrath of God upon the one who tended the hoist . He yanked at the rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the cage and ascended , and the cage made mincemeat of the man impaled in the shaft . When they reached the surface , a dozen furious men strode over to the engineer . It was obvious that he had been asleep . " You dog of a man ! " one of them roared . " You scurvy sleepyheaded bastard ! Why did n't you raise that cage when we signaled ? " " Huh ? " said the engineer , rubbing at his eyes . " Why , I just done it . " " You just murdered four men ! " Another spoke . " Let 's throw the son-of-a-bitch down the shaft ! " " What do you mean going to sleep when we 're blasting ? " " Asleep ? " said the engineer , unable to make sense of all this . " Why , you signaled and I brung her up . " " Let 's throw him in ! " " No , " said Luff . " That will do no good now . They 're dead . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Fred Grebe came along . " What 's all the racket here ? " " Go down and see for yourself ! Four men blowed to pieces because your lazy cage-boss went to sleep . " " Is that true ? " asked Grebe of his engineer . " Honest , " said the man , looking foolish and bewildered , " I do n't know what it 's all about . They yanked the rope and I upped her right quick . " " You 'll have to fire this man , " said Luff . " You giving me orders ? " asked Fred . " We 're giving you orders . " " And if I do n't ? " " Then we 'll throw you both down the shaft "  | Fred Grebe could change face with astonishing ease . In awful fury he swung to his engineer . " Skin the hell out ! " he roared . " You 're fired ! " " Me ? Why , they yanked the rope and I brung her up . " " Skin out ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had come within an inch of murder . That was a strange thing in his life . A little better now he understood that ugly madness that drove men to kill . It made him afraid of himself  --  afraid of those deep dark passions that beat in him and in the hearts of all men . But in the next moment he told himself , with a bitter grin , that wealth was still pouring across the ocean to Eilley who was visiting queens ; and he went back to work . A few days later , death struck again . They were blasting a crosscut . After a charge had spit in a horrible darkness of thunder and stone , one man , in advance of the others , climbed over tons of shattered rock on the floor and was descending to a floor beyond when suddenly , without any warning at all , the earth ceiling above him gave way . The man was buried to his shoulders . He bawled with mad and inhuman terror ; and when the others hastened forward they could see only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was raining earth and fragments like huge dirty flakes of snow . " We ca n't go in , " he said . " No , " said another . " The whole damn thing will fall any minute . " Nine men stood there , forty feet away , and looked at the one imprisoned . His arms were captured . Soon he was buried to his neck as if he were vanishing in quicksand . Only his face , turned toward them , was visible ; the falling earth was two inches deep on his hair . They could see his bulging eyes and his bawling mouth that pleaded , cursed , and wept . For a long moment he was silent , and when he spoke again he called them by name . " Lull , good God , you ai n't reckonun to let me die like this ! .. . Lars , please come and dig me out ! ... Bill .... " His eyes rolled from face to face as he spoke . " Bill , I been your friend , ai n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all the while he was slowly sinking . The  | earth beneath him was working convulsively in its bowels , rolling deep under , moving like guts in a strong physic , as if the entire Bowers mine were getting ready to let go and plunge . Even the earth and stones around his shoulders were quiveringly astir in a slow tide . " Let 's joke , " said Luff . " We ca n't do a thing , but jokes might make it easier . " There was nothing else they could do . The man was as inexorably doomed as if he were sinking in the ocean with a ton of iron tied to his feet . Luff ran back to a stope . He returned with an armful of oakum and a gallon of kerosene . Soaking the oakum in the oil , he tossed it out halfway to the man and threw a lighted match on it . It blazed up , devouring the gloom of the cavern , showing the face of the man ; and in a voice maddened by fear and agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were brave ; they were his friends . The light , he said , would guide them while they dug him out ; and when they did not move toward him , he cried like an animal out of terrible desolation . He was smothering , he told them ; his heart and guts were being pushed in upon him , driven to his bones . His wild cries and sobbing pleas were almost more than they could endure . " Have you , " Luff called to him , " heard the latest story about me ? I was going down the street with a sack of flour on my back . Sam Brown saw me when I passed the Crystal saloon . He laughed like hell . Look at that crazy fool ! ' he said . There he goes with a sack of flour and I 'll bet he ai n't got a quart of whisky in the house ! " ' But the man was sobbing in frenzy . The oakum was a bonfire of light . Then suddenly the great heap of earth and stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earth closed over his mouth . He tried to blow it away and they saw a tiny cloud of dust when once his breath burst through . They could see only his eyes now . Luff began to tell another story but stopped , sickened and choked . The oakum was burning low . Instead of looking at them , the man 's  | eyes , bursting from his skull , stared at the friendly light burning itself out . Luff turned to the other men . They were weeping . Then he realized that he was weeping too . Unable to endure the scene they turned away ; and when , after a little while , they looked back again , the man was gone . There was only the awful moving tide of earth and stone , and the glow of oakum that had burned itself out .  | CHAPTER XVII THE NEXT DAY LUFF DID NOT GO TO THE MINE . AFTER BREAKFAST he sat with his red face in his big hairy hands ; and Rebby watched him as she went about her housework . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ashes off the dirt floor of their cabin ; hung her iron and tin dishes on nails in the wall ; suspended a kettle of dough to a wire attached to the ceiling ; kicked the roll of soiled bedding into a corner ; and then gazed down at Luff while wiping her hands on a burlap sack . " Ai n't you going to work ? " " No . " " You et enough breakfast to gag an ox but you do n't feel like work ! " " I saw a man die yesterday . " That was too much for the embittered Rebby . " Holy Almighty , I guess you never seen a man die before ! " " Not that way . " " What way ? If you die , you die , and it do n't take long and it do n't matter how . " Luff did not care to discuss the matter with his wife . Wearily he changed the subject . " Where 's Nita ? " he asked . " She went out last night with that Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luff McCoy , if you do n't watch out your daughter will be a plain bitch . " " I know it , " he said with the toneless resignation of a man who looks at life and accepts it and knows that there is very little he can do to change it . Rebby sensed his resignation and hated it ; it only made her the more furious and embittered against him . " All your life , I guess ,  | you 'll work for Eilley . When she comes back from Europe she wo n't even speak to the likes of us . " " Maybe she wo n't . What of it ? " " I thought her and Sandy was your friends . Is that the kind of friends you got ? " Unable to stand the incessant nagging , Luff left the cabin to find his daughter . On his way through town he dropped in at the Crystal bar . At once he sensed a difference in the atmosphere of the place . The laughter was louder , the glasses tinkled more gaily than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no sign of the bully . " No need to look for him , " said Steve Gilpin , stepping up to the bar . " He 's dead . " " Sam is dead ? " " As dead as a whore 's babies . A little old Dutchman blew him to pieces . " Steve told the story . One of Sam 's henchmen was on trial over in Carson ; and , upon hearing of this , Sam sharpened his knives , primed his guns , filled his belly with whisky , and rode away , announcing that he would raise hell over in Carson . But a prosecuting attorney , as big and bold as any of the desperadoes he brought to justice , met Sam at the door with two derringers , marched him inside , had him sworn , and made him testify , all the while covering him with the two guns . That made Sam Brown mad . On his way back to Virginia City he stopped at a roadhouse and for the fun of it he took several shots at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutchman ten times as furious as Sam had ever been ; and after loading his shotgun with slugs he chased Sam into the hills and blew him in two . " When did this happen ? " asked Luff . " Last night . I 've just seen the coroner . He says Sam came to his death through the just dispensation of an all-wise Providence . On his bill of lading he wrote , It Served Him Right . " ' " Now , " Steve went on , " we have to have a new bully boy . I wonder who he 'll be . " Luff shook his head . He was preoccupied , and after a moment he  | allowed his friend to see what was troubling him . " Steve , " he said , " have you seen my daughter around ? " " She was with Craig last night . They were at the Black Crook . " " She 's a wild hussy , " said Luff dejectedly . " Oh , she 's all right , " said Steve in his casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he has ; and when he 's dry she 'll squeeze some other gent . " " She 'll get her foot in something , " said Luff . " Not Nita . She 's too smart . " Luff felt so low in spirit that he drank too much , and when he left the saloon the world beat upon him in a flood of sound and swam in a chaos of vision . It seemed strange to him that he was drink . Weaving , reaching out to grasp nothing because nothing was there , rolling his eyes and blowing gusts of breath as if choking off sneezes or belches , he staggered toward his cabin . In unintelligible monologue he was summarizing the senseless muddle of his years , his dread of being buried alive , his grief for his first wife who had left pain in him that was deeper than his laughter . His life , it seemed to him , was like the purposeless animation and power of the ocean : it made no difference whether he moved with the tide or against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul . When he reached the door his eyes were bathed in tears , but he did not know it . When Rebby 's anger burst against him , he did not understand what she said . She was only a windy eruption of abuse . She struck him , but her blow was a trivial sting . He was obscurely conscious of her outraged hulk and the convulsive twitchings in her face ; but she had no meaning for him beyond the vulgar violence that was the soul of any mining camp . She was yelling at him . " You drunkard ! You fool ! If your brains was giant powder and all blowed up at once it would n't make you sneeze ! If- " " That 's true , " he said in a low voice , half to himself , accepting the indictment as a part of all that was inevitable in life . " Where you been ? " Rebby demanded . He did not answer her . He tried to ignore her , tried to put her out  | of his consciousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashed him with her tongue , her fury mounting until at last she was almost overcome by her own wrath . She stood above him , her body shaking with indecision and hate ; and she poured upon his head the vilest abuse he had ever heard . Not even Mary Mahaffey had had such a torrential command of whorehouse jargon . Rebby was accusing him of having been to see Julia ; and her chronicle of his doings made him feel as if he had been born in a privy and had spent his life in a dungpile . Dazed , like one drugged and only half aware , he could see her bent over him , her hands clenched until the knuckles were like polished stones , her mouth vomiting abuse , her eyes opening and closing on her outpourings of suspicion and hatred . Then at last she was silent , but he did not know whether she was exhausted or looking round for a tool to murder him . While he waited he heard her give a strangled gasp as if she had been drenched with cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked at her . She was kneeling with her face to the wall , her hands clasped and her face uplifted . Not for a long moment did he realize what she was doing ; and when he understood that his wife was praying , that she was crying out of her tortured soul to the Lord , he rose in pity and astonishment . He was sober now . He went over and looked down at her . Her face was wet with tears , a face white from spent fury , white with shame . And all the while , in a babble of anguish , of supplication , of terror , she spoke to God . For years Luff had put up with Rebby 's abuse , and had accepted it as something for which there was no cure . He had developed an amazing tolerance of it  --  - quite as the human body can , under proper conditions , develop a tolerance of certain deadly poisons . When her tongue became.too wildly abusive for him to endure , it had been his habit to flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bottle . The reasons for her tantrums he had understood only obscurely , if at all ; but now for the first time he realized something of the thwarted ambitions , the goading envies , and the actual pain in the soul of his wife ; and , though he did not share her desire for wealth , he saw how much it had embittered her to live here where  | daily she saw others enriching themselves . He still loathed the animal 's greed ; but for her , the wife and woman , kneeling there , he felt deep compassion . " Do n't take it so hard , " he said gently . " Maybe we can find a mine and be rich too . " The change in Rebby now was as sudden as it had been a few minutes before . She scrambled to her feet . She was white and shaken , but she had understood what he said . " Do you mean that ? " she asked eagerly . " Do you mean we 'll be rich ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost him almost all his strength . He shuddered to think of his wife with the riches that Eilley had . " Do you promise ? " she asked , her feverish gaze on his face . " I ca n't promise . We'n try but we might not have any luck . " The mood of her prayer was gone now . " We'n be rich ! " she shouted . " If we ca n't find a mine , we'n steal one like the others do ! " " We 'll try and find one , " he said . Rebby sank to a bench , overcome by the thought of riches . She still looked at him ; and in her eyes was greed for a carriage and mansions and fine clothes , mixed with a strange new tenderness for this man who seemed at last to have come to his senses . Fearing that she would want to embrace him , Luff said he would go back to work now but he would keep his eyes peeled for the main chance . He went to work like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chastened and fearful of what he had committed himself to , his mind turned again to thoughts of death . He was not , like most of the brawny young miners , a fatalist who accepted the threat of death as part of their jobs . When they emerged at the end of a shift , they wanted nothing except to get drunk or squander their earnings at the gaming tables ; and men like Carter Craig lay in wait for them . Most of them were as indifferent as the owners to devices that would safeguard them underground . Nothing had been done  --  nothing , Luff was convinced , would ever be done  --  about the deadly heat , the inroads of water , the poisonous gases , or the  | crumbling ceilings and walls ; and if hundreds of thousands of feet of logs and beams were being taken into the mines , they were not to protect the workers but to keep the precious veins from caving in . As he went back to work , he approached a huge building with boiler rooms , blacksmith shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the time-keeper who kept track of timbermen , pump men , watchmen , pickboys , engineers , and miners ; and he entered a cage and vanished into an infernal region where there was neither night nor day but only perpetual lamplight . Down there was a vast and wet and gloomy world , a deep hell of winzes and stopes , chutes and crosscuts , crumbling walls , and blackened galleries . The workedout streets , especially in the larger mines , were weird in their dangerous ruins : timbers , twisted and splintered , were crushed to half their original length ; square chambers had been wrenched into nightmare shapes ; chutes had been telescoped and clogged ; walls and ceilings daily disintegrated and spilled . Galleries , crosscuts , and drifts were being run back under the two towns ; and soon , engineers said , they would rest on a thin floor of earth and beams above the miles of tunnels . Where the rock was firm , few if any timbers were used ; but in the crumbling chambers the roofs were supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to support the stupendous weight above them , and often in a week or two were driven down and broken until not even the rats could find their way under them . How many thousands of men toiled in these hells underground Luff did not know ; but there were scores of mines , all overlapping in their claims , and every one struggling in three eight-hour shifts to grab the ore before others could get it . Now and then a blast opened a hole into an adjoining and unsuspected tunnel , and rival crews of workers looked at one another in surprise , realizing the two mines had overrun . At first there had been an attempt on the part of owners or their superintendents to set limits on their properties ; but greed soon spurned the amicable compromise . There were bitter quarrels above the surface , and desperate feuds below . Engineers were helpless . When one mine blasted into the quartz  | claimed by another , engineers and superintendents ran around on the surface , measuring and exploring , running shafts to look down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another began . They descended in cages and prowled in the darkness , carrying lamps and maps , peering at compasses , sampling ore bodies , and returning to the surface more confused than when they went down . The more ruthless superintendents  --  and Fred Grebe was one of them  --  said to hell with trying to measure and survey ; let each get what he could , and the devil take the hindmost . This practice developed savage battles deep in the earth . One of them marked a turn in Luff McCoy 's life . A few days after promising Rebby that for her sake he would try to get rich , he and fellow powder monkeys found themselves looking through a cloud of smoke at a dozen evil faces . They had been following and opening a vein , and behind them had come timber workers , propping the roof . They had never suspected that they were close to the tunnels of another mine . A thousand feet under the surface a man had no sense of direction but followed veins where they led and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faulted and disappeared . Sometimes a vein rose , sometimes it fell , and sometimes it twisted like a corkscrew . Somehow the superintendent of the next mine had known that they were approaching . He had hired a dozen of the town 's toughest bullies and placed them on his side of the wall ; and after the explosion , there they were , grinning like devils in the murk . They were unarmed . They were the kind of bully who liked to fight with fists and teeth . " What in hell , " their leader demanded , " do you mean blowun our mine up ? " Among the powder monkeys in the Bowers mine was a gigantic Swede whom none knew by more than the name of Lars . He was a strange man . He had inordinate pride in his magnificent body ; and often , when stripped to his waist , swinging pick or mattock , his muscles toiling with effortless ease , he had been seen to pause and gaze at himself with childlike admiration . He never smoked or  | drank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face had been entrusted to him as a treasure to watch over day and night . It was Lars who now stepped forward . " Got tamn you ! " he bellowed , and knocked one of the bullies cold . That was enough . The other hired rascals closed in and two dozen men grappled in the lamplight . Gently , without anger , Luff put his great arms around a man and dragged him over to a wall , crushed him down among the stones , and sat on him as if he were a bag of sand . He held a rock above the man 's head and told him not to move . Then he peered into the gloom to learn how the fight was going . It was difficult to tell . Men were falling over one another or over the stones blown out by the last charge . There was no cursing ; they were too busy for that . But presently Luff saw one of the bullies sneak away like a shadow along the far wall ; and soon one by one they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luff rose and told this man to get out , and like a beast he crawled away . Luff could see his fellow miners huddled in a group , and it seemed to him that their silence was most unusual . They ought to be shouting with victory . He peered at them . They were all motionless , speechless , as if turned to stone . Sensing that some very extraordinary emotion possessed them , he moved forward ; and then he perceived that one of the men was standing apart and the others were staring at him . The man standing alone was the Swede . His back was toward Luff , and Luff had to go around him to find out what the others were looking at . It was a long moment before he understood what had happened . The lower half of the Swede 's face looked as if it had been thrust into a bucket of red paint . His naked breast looked that way too . Luff 's next realization came as a shock of anger and pain . The Swede 's nose has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the bone , was gone ; and now over his mouth and chin and hairy breast , blood was flowing in a warm red bath . But all that , Luff understood , was not the terrible part of it . The men were looking at the Swede 's eyes . It was not rage or pain that they saw . It was more than bewilderment ,  | deeper than grief . What held them silent was the spectacle of a man spiritually naked and defenseless , gazing with an inward eye on the death of himself  --  as if he watched vultures at his heart . The men were baffled and chilled by what they saw in the eyes of Lars ; and they might have stood there a long time , gazing at him , if the Swede had not moved . He had been standing without a tremor in his whole body , but now he shuddered as if coming awake . A hand rose slowly to his face , and fingers gently , experimentally , moved over the torn flesh , seeking a nose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in his eyes became more terrible . The hand dropped . Then with one awful cry that was more bestial than human , Lars turned and seized a lamp and raced madly down the crosscut . The men followed him . When they came to the cage shaft , Lars had already signaled and gone up , and they had to wait for the cage to descend ; and upon emerging at the surface , the hoistman looked as if he had seen a ghost or a devil . " Where did he go ? " they shouted . " That way , " he said . The men ran over to Virginia City and up C Street , pausing at one saloon and another to look for him . When they found the Swede , he was standing at a bar , gazing into a mirror . A hundred men around him were howling with laughter . A few of them had sunk to the floor , where they rolled about hugging their bellies and laughing till the tears rolled down their cheeks . Men fell helpless across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and swearing by all the gods that this was the funniest thing they had ever seen . And all the while Lars stared solemnly at himself . If he heard the laughter and jeers he gave no sign . Steve Gilpin heard of the matter and came in . " What has happened ? " he asked Luff . Luff said there had been a fight in the Bowers mine and a bully had chewed the Swede 's nose off ; but he knew that was no answer at all . Other men here had had noses bitten off , fingers amputated by teeth , and ears torn from skulls . " How long has he been standing there ? "  | " Ever since we came in . " " Has he gone crazy ? " " Something funny has happened to him . " Steve went over to have a closer look at Lars . The laughter was dying down . Men who had bellowed only sniggered now and coughed . They were not asking Lars if he had been in a dog-fight . They were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what sort of beast he was . A silence had fallen on the crowd . Out of the silence Lars seemed to come to himself  --  if not wholly , at least enough to signal for brandy . The liquor vanished into the red maw of his face . He shuddered and straightened . But still he looked at himself in the mirror , as though unable to take his eyes away from the ruin he saw there . One by one men began to leave the saloon . It was not the blood or the mutilated face that drove them out . They had seen worse things . It was nothing to lose a little flesh in a town where Sam Brown had carved hearts out ; where men had fought duels with knives until meat hung in ribbons ; where men had come out of mines with hands blown off and blood spurting from the stumps . The loss of a nose was a trivial thing . Nevertheless , there was something here that none of these men had ever seen before , and one by one they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and said in an awed whisper : " He 's like a castrated bull standing alone in a field . " Lars must have heard it . He turned and slowly came over to Steve and Luff , and there was not a sound in the saloon . Why he came over , or what he wanted or felt , nobody could have said . After a few moments he went back to the bar and stood there , looking at his face . Luff and Steve were the last to go out . In other saloons and in crowds on the street , men were talking of this strange Swede who had lost his nose . Some spoke angrily as if they resented him ; some said he was a big baby who ought to have his ears trimmed off too .  | But others , possibly understanding more , said he should be left alone or he might go off his nut and try to murder the town . Luff was profoundly stirred by what he had witnessed , and on his way home he stopped off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a philosopher in his way , and Luff sometimes liked to talk to the old man . " I come to have a drink with you , " he said . " I 've decided to quit my job in the mine . " " Fine ! " cried the old sot , and poured from a jug into a tin cup , which he handed to Luff . " They ai n't no justice no more . God give the deadbeats a full house and two aces up their sleeve , but all He ever give a honest man is a conscience . Life ai n't nothun but a drunk and a headache and another drunk , till death it comes along and your head stops achun . " " That 's about right . " Virginee 's old face was so baked and seamed with dirt and woe that he looked like a scarified mummy . His teeth were snags . His long gray hair was full of earth and sagebrush leaves . " Darn civilization ! " he cried , and with a trembling old hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't for whisky a man would be a beast . Long as he drinks he has holy thoughts , and when I get plumb guzzled I think of God . " Luff pondered that . " When a man 's sober , " Virginee went on waggishly , " he thinks of money . When he 's drunk he thinks of women or God . I 'm too old to think of women any more . " This last observation reminded Luff that he had not yet found Nita , and he asked the old man if he had seen her . " This mornin I see her with that no-account Craig . He 's a bad man . He wo n't never drink , and I figger a man who wo n't never drink is up to tricks . " Virginee drank again and wiped his beard . " For why you quittun your job ? " " I told my wife I 'd try and get rich so she could ride in a carriage . " " My sixty-thousand dollar hoss , that critter up and died on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " I guess I should , " said Luff , and emptied his cup . " Well , I have to find my daughter now . I have to tell her the good news . " " Good news ? " asked Virginee , squinting up at him . " I have to tell her that her father is going to be like all the other people here  --  just one more fool hankering to be rich . " " I was rich , " said Virginee . " But now I 'm a porper and folks brings me whisky . Civilization , it done me up . " For a moment Luff looked at the filthy old wretch for whom the richest city on earth had been named . He was only a pauper now , a wretched thing of skin and bones . Some morning he would be found dead in his hut with the jug at his side .  | CHAPTER XVIII IT WAS A RASH PROMISE LUFF HAD MADE , HIS WIFE AND HE KNEW IT well . There was no chance to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the desert . The only way left for a man to get his hands on an easy fortune here was to gamble or to speculate . Luff had never been a gambler ; and of wildcat schemes , stock manipulation , and all the other highways to wealth traveled by parasitic gentlemen , he knew nothing at all . Of the horrors in the mines he had had enough . The nightmares underground outraged his gentle and philosophic soul . Rather than toil down there , he would take the way of old Virginee and sit with a jug , drinking his empty years to their end . Perhaps he could get a job in a gambling hall and study the ways of men like Carter Craig ; for there was a fellow who never toiled , yet always had money to burn . Or possibly when Eilley returned she would give him something to do above-ground . Thought of Craig reminded him that he was seeking his spitfire of a daughter ; but while going from saloon to saloon , he saw that tireless hoaxer , Steve Gilpin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd of Indians . After their pine nut orchards had been destroyed , and most of their braves had been slaughtered , the starved and abject survivors had come to the city , some to beg and some to work , and all of them to steal and eat any offal they could find . Their favorite squatting place was on a vacant lot by a fruit stand . There they were today ; and there was Steve , acting as if he were one of them . The Indians were having a feast . Cross-legged in the group sat an old and fat squaw . Over her lap was spread a shawl that served as a basket for rotten apples , wormy cherries , soured strawberries , and all the other bad fruits thrown from the stand . Small boys and girls , gluttonously feeding , were smeared to their eyes with the rotten  | mess . Smoke Creek Sam , an enormous buck , was sitting with head thrown back and both hands feeding strawberries , stems and dirt and all , into his open mouth . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head up and his mouth open ; and when his hands were reaching out to the squaw 's lap , his open mouth and waiting face had the expectancy of a gaping nestling . The Paiutes would eat almost anything that they could swallow ? except scorpions . Steve watched these filthy and degenerate people and then wrote about them in his newspaper . He had written of a certain Paiute brave who often marched up the street , woodsaw and buck under his arm , and over his shoulder an axe ; his face painted in weird zigzag lines of black , white , and red ; a necklace of bear paws dangling at his breast and an eagle feather in his scalp lock . He was off to labor on a white man 's woodpile . Winking at Luff , Steve bought a handful of fruit , gave it to an Indian girl , and told her to sing . This girl was half-naked , with her long black mane covering almost as much of her as her dirty dress or blanket . She was barefooted . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurd way she rolled her eyes at white men or shook her buttocks in imitation of harlots . Pointing her nose into the sky like a hunting dog , she sang in a high cracked voice . " I feel like a tomorra mornun star ! Soo fly , do n't bodda my ! Soo fly , do n't bodda my ! . . . " Men laughed at her singing but she thought the laughter was applause . Men tried to lure her away to rape her , inviting her with shining stones and pieces of ribbon ; but always a tall and silent buck followed dangerously on the trail . Steve remained with the Indians , and Luff entered a saloon . He went to all the saloons  --  there were a hundred of them  --  but there was no sign of Nita ; and when darkness came he went to the opium dens . Like most of the men here , he detested in the Chinese their Oriental slyness , their politely contemptuous cunning . Wood peddlers traipsed about with their laden donkeys , but the rascals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail and kept the beast 's head toward the buyer . If a man tried to walk around the beast to see the rear end of the load , the Chinese kept the animal turning in circles and strove to make a quick sale . The load was a dollar ordinarily ; but if a storm seemed to be brewing , it was " One dollar quarty , " and if a storm was actually approaching , it was " One dollar hap . " In caves of an eastern hill were the opium dens , and toward them Luff made his way . The largest of them had a huge door of slabs , but to his knock it opened as noiselessly as if hinged in cups of oil . Inside there was a small lamp suspended from a pine log ; by a rickety table sat a sallow old man . Around him on the table were several boxes of opium , pipes , scales for weighing , small steel spatulas , and wire probes . " Me come see your smokee saloon , " said Luff . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tiers , each bunk so close to the one above or below , or to the ceiling or floor , that a fat man could hardly have squeezed in . These bunks filled every wall , and men filled nearly all the bunks . They were in various stages of stupor . Before each was a tiny alcohol lamp whose blue flame gave a ghastly pallor to the smoker 's face . The sweetish-bitter odor of burning opium filled the den . Some of the men lay with wide-open eyes fixed in a glassy stare ; others lay with eyes partly or wholly closed . There were a few Chinese but most of the smokers were parasites from the cities for whom the stupors of alcohol were no longer enough . While Luff was looking round him , half hoping , half fearing to see Nita 's face , a man entered . The sallow old Chinese , treading as softly as a cat , went over and lit a lamp at an empty berth , waited for the man to crawl in , placed opium and pipe before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was spoken . " Do women ever come here ? " asked Luff . A sotted wretch turned a little and fixed Luff with a leaden stare . " Just whores , " he said , and sucked again at his pipe .  | " Do you know my daughter , Nita McCoy ? " " Yeah , I know her . " " Does she ever come here ? " " She ai n't a whore , is she ? " said the man . Upon leaving the den , Luff drew a deep breath ; the fumes inside had made him feel a little giddy . From den to den he went along the hill , but men said they had never seen Nita smoking opium . If he waited until midnight , he supposed he could find her in the Black Crook , the favorite saloon of the big-time gamblers ; and there he found her . She was sitting at a table with Farner Peel . Now that Sam Brown was dead , Peel was the bully boy of the two cities , though he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murderer for the fun of it . Luff went over to the table ; Peel rose and bowed . " Mind if I join you ? " asked Luff . " Not at all , " said the Harvard-trained bully boy . Luff sat down and looked at his daughter , who was trying scornfully to ignore him . She wore a stunning gown that must have cost some gambler , he reflected , a pretty poke of dust . " I do n't see you home much any more , " he said , doing his best to make light of the matter . " Home ! " she cried . " I ai n't got any home . " Sensing that this little feud between father and daughter was no business of a gentleman , Peel excused himself and went to the bar . Luff said : " I 've left the mine . " " Well , what of it ? " " I thought you might like to know . I promised Rebby I 'd try hard to find some way to get rich . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with wild laughter . " You get rich ? " " I mean it , " said Luff , feeling old and burdened and futile . " I 've never wanted to be rich , but Rebby wants money , you want money ? " Do n't worry about me . I 'll have money  --  and lots of it . "  | Luff stared at his daughter . She had always been a little wild , and now he realized , as though seeing her for the first time , that she was also as cold and hard as steel . Was she , he wondered , already a harlot in the flesh ? He wanted to ask her , but he hardly knew how to put the question . " Nita , tell me  --  you 're running around with wealthy gamblers , they buy you fine things , they spend a lot of money on you ; but ? Well , men do n't do that sort of thing " You mean do I pay them off ? " she said quickly , and with open contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's any of your business , yes I do , like the sons-of-bitches deserve . Now and then I let them put an arm around me  --  and I figger that 's worth a new gown . I told you once that virtue is what costs a lot . " She curled her lips . " I still got a million dollars worth of virtue that ai n't been bought yet . " Luff sighed . He felt relief . It was a shameful thing to accept presents from men and play them along ; but perhaps she was right . Perhaps the men were worth even less than that . " Is it true that you 've been smoking opium ? " he asked , referring to a rumor he had heard about her . " No , " she said flatly ; then : " Oh , I tried it a couple of times . But a woman ca n't handle her men if she smokes opium or gets drunk . " Unexpectedly she leaned across the table and touched his arm . " Daddy , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but men do n't respect them . There 's other women that make men pay and pay . They 're the ones men respect . You know my ambition ? I 'll be the most respectable woman in this town . " Luff hardly knew what to make of that . Nita 's philosophy was so coldly logical and calculating that it was almost inhuman . " If I get rich , " he said earnestly , " will you come back home and be a lady ? " " I am a lady . Anyway , how can you get rich ? " " I do n't know yet . I'n try . I guess to speculate is the only way left . " " Speculate with what ? "  | " I do n't know , " he said , for his pockets were as empty now as they had always been . Nita had been looking at him thoughtfully . " I know a way , " she said , " but I wo n't tell you now . You do what you can , and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you want a drink ? " " I would n't mind , " he said . Nita lifted a hand and a bartender hastened over . " A bottle of your best , " she said ; and with a malicious smile at her father , she added : " And charge it to Farner Peel . " Harlots had flocked to Virginia City  --  big fat girls in hurdygurdies ; hard-faced gold-toothed sirens at faro tables ; birds of paradise walking the streets in clothes and jewelry that shamed the wooden Indians . In the Black Crook were female singers with a repertoire of sentimental and bawdy ballads . For the men here , as Nita well knew , these girls were only fleshpots to be embraced and despised . The rough men who addressed them with vile words fell back abashed when she passed . And Luff knew all that . Here and in other mining camps he had known men who thought nothing of flogging a harlot within an inch of her life ; and the same men would try to touch a " good " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark to kiss the hem of feminine laundry on a line . So here : brutal louts who would have kicked a prostitute down the stairs fell back with gawky apology when they crowded too close to Nita . " Just look at that , will you , " said Nita , nodding toward a platform at the far end of the room , where a hard-eyed strumpet was shaking her huge buttocks and singing a song . " I will tell you of a feller , Of a feller I have seen , Who was neither white nor yeller , Nor was altogether green ; Oh , my life aloor alickum , Oh , my life aloor alem ! " Oh , he come one night to see me And he made so long a stay  | That I thought the God-damn blockhead Never meant to go away ! Oh , my life aloor alickum , Oh , my life aloor alem ! " So I says to him : Come on , now ! Do your stuff and hit the grit ! There 's a dozen others waitun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my life aloor alickum , Oh , my life aloor alem ! . . . " This song was greeted with roars of laughter and loud applause . Nita leaned toward Luff . " Why , " she asked , " do n't men respect her ? " " She 's a whore , " Luff replied simply . " That ai n't it . It 's because she 's a two-dollar whore . Men do n't respect a woman that just any man can have . They respect the woman that they think only they can have  --  that is , if she makes them do their level damndest to get her . And if they do n't never quite get her , then they respect her all the more . That 's men for you  --  and they call it romance ! " The slattern with the gold teeth was singing again . " Oh , I 'll not marry a man who chews , For he goes slobberun from chin to shoes ! Oh , I 'll not marry at all , at all , Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll not marry a man who pours His liquor and gold dust down the whores ! Oh , I 'll not marry at all , at all , Oh , I 'll not marry at all ! . . . " A man standing by the bar was looking at Nita . He was drunk . Gathering himself together as if piece by piece , he came staggering over . He turned his glazed and unfocused eyes on Luff . " Doan ever git married , " he said , gesturing at him with a dirty finger . " Doan ever . I 'll tell you why . Wen your wife gits all the clothes she wans ,  | then she has a sick sisser , and she 's got a-visit her sisser . Then her sick sisser dies . She 's got a-have money to bury the sick sisser what dies . Then your fatherinlor is sick , jist as sick as the sisser was . She 's got a-have money ? " Farner Peel stepped up and led the man away ; but the drunkard turned a waggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , doan ever ! " " That , " said Nita , " is the only sense I ever heard from a drunkard . " Among other men who had been covertly gazing at Nita was Bill Terry , Virginia City 's most incorrigible prankster . Many stories were told of him . In a cafe , it was said , an Englishman had found a hair in his butter . He was furious . Bill went over to the Englishman and poked at the butter and pretended to draw out a hair as big as a shoelace . He asked the Englishman what he expected . " Why , " Bill said , " we fatten our cows on sagebrush , and sagebrush will make hair grow on a bald head ; so is it surprising if it makes hair grow on butter ? " Bill now came over , a glass of whisky in one hand and a glass of rum in the other . He offered Nita her choice of the two , and then touched her glass . " Here 's to your first kid  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried suddenly , " what 's that ? " It was the harlot launching into another song . " Tomoree , Pa , I 'm sweet sixteen , And Billy Grimes , the drover , Has popped the question to me , Pa , And wants to be my lover ! He 's comun here tomoree , Pa , This is the way he 's headun , And I 'm to have a talk with him Betwixt the sheets of beddun .... " " I guess I better make some love to that girl , " said Bill . " She sounds plumb desperate . " He looked at the singer for a long moment before adding : " I 'll prospect her . If she do n't pan no color I 'll be back . " A little later , Pete O'Reilley came shuffling over , all legs and arms .  | Stupid , illiterate , mad , he had been enshrined in legend as one of the discoverers of the Lode ; and hoaxers had encouraged him to believe that he was a great man . Guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , single-handed , driving a tunnel into the mountain , convinced that its core was pure gold . The wags of the town gave him every encouragement in this enterprise by going out now and then to look at his hole . Pete was a queer creature in this city of thick-shouldered men . He looked sick . Unable to read or write , and chockful of morbid phantasies , he moved like a tongueless specter when not bent over his pick . But when he found a sympathetic ear , he poured out a tale of incalculable riches awaiting him in the heart of Sun Mountain . In any crowd he stared hopefully from face to face , and at the least sign of friendliness he shuffled over . " It 's there ! " he cried to Luff . The pronoun had come to stand in his mind for nothing except gold . He spoke of it as reverent men spoke of God . " The spirits tell me to dig furder ! " His eyes had the consuming and unholy fire of a lunatic for whom life had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a huge cat , Peel came over and led Pete away . " How does Peel make his money ? " asked Luff . " Gambling . When men play with him nobody dares to win . " Luff noticed in the crowd a large handsome man named Joe Plato . A year ago Joe had been penniless ; he was now one of the town 's wealthiest men . A year ago he had owned ten feet of quartz and did n't believe it was worth a cent . One day he went to San Francisco and spent a night with a harlot ; and because he had no money , he gave her half his mine . He returned to discover that his mine was worth a million . Thereupon he dashed back to San Francisco to recover the five feet from the harlot ; but she was too smart for him . She said he could have it if he would marry her . So Joe married her . Now Mrs. Joe Plato rode in a carriage behind blooded horses . Suddenly a huge woman barged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight . She looked like a man in woman 's  | clothes . She was called the Sage Hen and nobody knew her by any other name . The story was told of her that once Sage Hen had persuaded two Irishmen to jump a claim for her , and had knocked the owner down when he protested . She had a black downy beard , and a mustache visible across the room . Some said she was a man masquerading as a woman ; others leered knowingly and said they knew better than that . For Sage Hen was a harlot too ; and she took men as if she were putting diapers on babies , and slapped them with wrathful impatience if they dallied or delayed . Sage Hen was in a rowdy mood tonight  --  and from the moment of her entrance , everybody waited to see what she would do . She tossed off a brandy , wiped her mouth with a big paw , and then looked from face to face as if seeking a foe . Her eyes rested at last on the strumpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another brandy as if it were water , Sage Hen strode down the saloon . Directly in front of the singer she stopped , her great legs far apart , big hands on her hips . " Shut up that God-damn racket before I knock them gold teeth down your throat ! " The wench stopped singing and looked at her enemy . Men began to lay wagers . But the proprietor was indignant . He had imported a dozen broad-hipped slatterns to entertain his guests , and he now hastened over and grasped Sage Hen by one of her muscular arms . Without looking at him she shook his hand off . " Tell her to shut up before I yank them nuggets out of her mouth ! " " She 's singing ! " cried the angry proprietor . " Leave her alone or I 'll throw you out . " The threat made Sage Hen turn . She turned slowly , ponderously , as if moved by a windlass . " When do you aim to begin ? " The proprietor appealed to his guests . " Ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best entertainment in Virginia City . At enormous expense I have imported the best artists from California . I 've never had a lady put out of my place in all the years I 've been in business ; and I appeal to you , ladies and gentlemen ? "  | His appeal was shut off by one of Sage Hen 's big hands . She simply reached over and clapped a palm to his mouth , her fingers closing over the lower half of his face . And there for a moment he stood , his eyes bulging and furious . Then Sage Hen closed her fingers as if squeezing paint out of a big tube , and his chin was secreted from her clutch . " All right , " she said , releasing the proprietor with a shove of her powerful open fist that sent him reeling , " let her howl ! Who in hell cares a damn ? " Before morning came , all the rowdies in the Black Crook were drunk . With hungry eyes they stared at one faro girl and another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to dance . If a man fell , he dragged his girl down with him , and then lay on the floor , drunkenly hugging her until another man came along and lifted the girl to her feet . Some of the men who fell did not rise but lay among the dancers , trying to see legs in the skirts flying around them . Nobody asked Nita to dance . She was Farner Peel 's woman tonight , and they were all afraid of Peel . It was daylight when Luff left the saloon . He was more than a little drunk , and he was dizzy , and everything around him seemed unreal . Instead of going home he climbed Sun Mountain and sat in the cool sweet air of morning , gazing at the hellbent town below him and at the golden lithograph of the eastern sky . He felt like an old and shameful fool . Born poor , he had lived from hand to mouth for more than forty years ; but now he was going after riches . He was going to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mansion like Eilley 's ; to ride in a brougham like Julia 's ; and to cover his great belly with linen and broadcloth . In a sage nearby a thrush was singing . A new day was warm and gentle on the eastern hills .  | CHAPTER XIX WHEN SHE CROSSED THE SIERRAS AND LOOKED DOWN INTO NEVADA , Eilley 's first thought was not of her mansion nor of the tons of stuff she had shipped from Europe ; it was of the city where she would be the guiding spirit and the uncrowned queen . There were two towns really , but she looked upon Gold Hill as a suburb of Virginia City ; and she always spoke of the two as if they were one place . Virginia City belonged to her and she belonged to it ; and her first duty , she told Sandy , was to look it over and find out what it had been doing while she was gone . " I orter look it over too , " said Sandy , remembering that he was to be a banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eilley , considering , " I guess you should . There 's things you'n find out that a lady ca n't . And after we look at the city , we 'll see about our mine ; and then we 'll go over to our mansion . " Louisa Ellis had much to tell but Eilley had no time to listen now . " Later , " she said . " Later you'n tell me all the news . Today you take care of our daughter while we look around . Louisa , do n't you let her out of your sight a single instant . " " Mercy me , " said Louisa , " I would n't think of it ! " And she murmured : " What a beautiful child ! " Eilley found very little in Virginia City to approve . During her absence it seemed to her that the place had gone hogwild . There were many new buildings , but they all seemed to be saloons or gambling halls or brothels . There were the same ugly serpentine streets , the filthy Indians squatting everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and added to these were other civic problems that would need all her genius and energy to solve .  | There was the dust . Always , day and night , C street was a hullabaloo of bull-wackers , mule-skinners , and beasts . Over everything was a cloud of dust , of smoke and alkali , until floors were sanded with it and buildings were kalsomined gray . Back of the main street were the hoisting works with their great belching stacks ; and above them on every bluff and ledge were the vulgar advertisements of pills , syrups , tonics , water cures , magnetic baths , and motorpathic exercises . Huge signs told men to drink Sazerac , to gamble at the Eldorado , to eat at the Howling Wilderness , to dance at the Melodeon . Eilley remembered the beautiful streets of Paris and wondered how she could make a fair city of this ugly camp . Over the Divide , Gold Canyon clear to the Carson River , was a continuous line of quartz mills , tunnels , dumps , sluices , water wheels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of the canyon were honeycombed with shafts , tunnels , and dumps . Two thousand teamsters were now employed in freighting ; and the Pioneer Stage Company had twelve resplendent Concord coaches with six horses to each , and six hundred blooded horses in its stables . Their fifty-three drivers wore linen dusters and lemoncolored gloves . Eilley approved all that ; but Virginia City as a whole sickened her . It was a bedlam from end to end . A humorist who had come to the place said it had delirium trivia ; but Eilley saw nothing trivial in a coach that passed her , its carriage lamps encrusted with gold , its coachman dressed in purple and fine linen , its beasts harnessed with silver . She saw nothing trivial in gawdy C Street , with its gas jets on iron standards , its balconies fenced with black iron , its iron pots filled with red geraniums covered with dust ; nor in the saloons with bars of solid mahogany inlaid with ivory and brass , murals by California artists , white marble figures in corner niches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing skirt , Benecia Boy Heenan in tights , and the sad face of Abraham Lincoln between the two . Before every cigar store was a wooden Indian painted in hideous colors . Before one , Pocahontas held out a half-dozen fine Havanas ; before another , Minnehaha offered Yellowleaf ; and at the entrance  | of a third , Black Hawk had a long blue pipe that reached to his wampum belt . The windows of drugstores were filled with immense decanters , gold-mounted , and striped with blue , red , and green . And everywhere she saw Chinese vending fruit and wood , ragged Paiutes prowling as scavengers , dirty organ-grinders torturing sick and diseased monkeys , Jews peddling castoff clothing , and hurdygurdy wenches singing lewd songs on street corners and begging a quarter . After seeing European cities , Eilley hardly knew what to think of this place . It angered and disgusted her . It was a hideous camp of saloons and brothels , of dust and filth . She wanted to burn it to the ground . She wanted a Washoe wind to blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet the ugliest , spot in the world ; it had more to build with , yet built only in squalor and sin . Dismayed , Eilley returned to her cabin to consider the matter and lay plans ; but Sandy explored until midnight . He found old friends , intending to make their eyes pop with a narrative of his journey to Europe ; but on the contrary , they made him gape with amazement as he listened to what had happened in Virginia City while he was gone . Luff and Steve and John Mackay , as well as Fred Grebe and others , told him so much that was weird or fanciful , incredibly brutal , outrageously funny , that Sandy 's head ached with all that he had to tell Eilley when he got home . He heard of the man who came to the outskirts of Virginia City with eight yoke of oxen . The man tied his beasts together with a rope and turned them free to graze while he prepared a meal . One of the oxen slipped and fell into a mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the others were yanked after it . Down they went , one after another , the last beast vanishing with such speed that it was turned belly upward , with legs flying . He heard of an arrogant visitor who swore that the coffee here was fit only for invalids and sick old women ; and of how Bill Terry chopped up an entire plug of black-strap tobacco and boiled it in a pot of coffee . The visitor said it was fine , and swilled one cup after another ; but a pale young man who tried it crawled across C Street  | on hands and knees , with a hump in his back and his head lowered , like a cayuse getting ready to buck . A crowd gathered to watch him arch his back and howl out of sickness . They had seen strange things , but never a human being hiking around on all fours and acting as if he would burst with pain . He heard of Bill Stewart , fair-haired giant who carried a derringer because , he said , a man had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as a window . It was Bill who , singlehanded , had organized the Nevada territory in six weeks , setting up counties to control votes , even though there was nothing in them but wolves and rattlesnakes and a handful of voters whom Bill had sent there . Bill placed the capital in Carson because , he thundered by the living God , his children must have decent water to drink . It was Bill who was the attorney of scoundrels . The courtroom was the loft of a barn , and into it Bill climbed with fifty armed henchmen , and slept at night far out in the desert where his enemies could not find him . The judge sat on a bag of oats and used a wagonbox for a desk ; and the jurors sat around him on piles of hay . If justice , said Bill , could not stand the pastoral odors of cattle dung , then what in hell was a democracy for ? His wife , Sandy reflected , would have to put Bill Stewart in his place . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the newspaper , and which persons far away had believed ; of the donkeys which ate gunnysacks and clothing , bedding and bacon and beans ; and of one which ate a whole bag of self-rising flour and went for a drink . As the donkey drank , it began to swell , and there it stood , drinking and inflating , until its legs thrust out like those on a carpenter 's bench . Editors on the Coast believed the story and copied it , and wrote editorials about it ; and Virginia City wags loved the comment of one : " It shows the powerful fermentation of yeast and leaves us speculating on its future uses . " A second fable was of packrats as big as badgers that carried away everything in the homes of men , including stoves , trunks , tables , and the smaller livestock . But for everything they took away they  | returned a hunk of pure silver . After a while the miners perceived the senselessness of labor , and replaced each stolen article with another of its kind ; until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , mines were abandoned , mills dismantled , and freight-wagons were busy night and day bringing in stoves and iron pots and everything for which these enormous rats had a fancy . These rats , his fable said , were neotamas ; indisputably rats , they were an oversized and underground species hitherto unknown to the world of science . They had batlike ears that could house a pumpkin ; great sly faces like those of prehistoric rabbits ; and coal-black eyes as big as billiard balls . This story , too , was believed and copied , and men in the academic world wrote letters , asking for further details . Steve published the letters and Virginia City howled . In the rickety building that housed the newspaper , Steve gave Sandy a lecture on Virginia City , and on Eilley 's folly in thinking she could make it over . It was , he said , a place where the most violent excesses were accepted as the commonplace and the trivial ; where human emotions fed on the raw and the brutal ; where life was so cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had the lusting impatience of the winds that poured in gray and aimless delirium down Sun Mountain and across the desert . It had the vigor of a mountain river at its spring flood . It had everything that the human race was or had been , and perhaps the rampant and unrefined power of all that it could ever hope to be . It was a carnival and a circus and a bedlam ; but it was also the itching palm and hungering heart of a nation . It was an obsessed glutton of a town that never got its belly full ; but behind its unashamed audacity was the strength that bred giants . As for making the town over , Eilley had better take a lesson , Steve said , from Adolph Sutro . There was a man with a noble purpose , but wags had made a monstrous fable of his dream . His unbuilt tunnel they ridiculed as a highway to heaven , claiming that it would have roadside taverns , magnificent depots , a pavement like polished silver , an atmosphere that smelled of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tunnel would have curtains on  | false windows , lovers in canoes on the river that would flow through it , and embroidered handkerchiefs for the locomotive engineer to wipe his nose on . Some called it the Tunnel Through the Babylon Gardens , or the Tunnel of Pure Water , or the Avenue of Roses . " Sandy , " Steve said , " we are glad to have you and Eilley back with us ; but if , as you tell me , Eilley is determined to make our town over and physic it of all its sin , and give it clean streets and trees and parks , then she 'll find herself down Sutro 's coyote hole . Virginia City is n't Europe ; it 's the soul of the United States , and it does n't want any damned culture . Tell her that . " " I will , " said Sandy . " But Eilley , she do n't change her mind very easy . Her heart is all set . " " Well , then I guess Virginia City will break her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Eilley 's indignant ears the same stories Sandy had been hearing ; and when he returned , he found her in no mood to listen . He was chockful and spilling over with news , but Eilley said she had heard enough . " Steve , he said to tell you they do n't want no culture . He said this ai n't Yoorup . He said " Never mind what he said ! Who is Steve Gilpin to tell me anything ? " The next day they rode over on the stage to see their mansion . It was rumored that unscrupulous men had bilked them right and left , charging many times what the building actually cost . Eilley did not know . In fact , she did not know how much she had paid for it . She was not a bookkeeper . Her mine was pouring silver into her lap and would , she believed , as long as she lived ; and she saw no sense in keeping accounts . She could not have told if the big structure , looking much like a stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . When she arrived , a voluble man whom she had never seen before , took them in hand as if they were tourists . He talked about the house as if he were trying to sell it to them , calling attention to this and that , and declaring that these walls of granite would stand until  | the Lord came . Even in an earthquake , he said , not a beam or stone would wiggle ; and as for cyclone , flood , or fire , there was nothing to worry about . Every door and window , he assured her , moved as if greased ; she would not find a squeak in the floors ; and when she saw the magnificent decorations in the library " Yes , yes , " said Eilley impatiently , " but we did n't come to listen to you talk  --  we came to see for ourselves . " Everything outside had looked good , but she found it almost impossible to enter the mansion . The tons of boxes and crates from Europe were piled to the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold all the treasures she had bought . While she looked at one box and another , trying to remember what each contained , the man at her elbow was murmuring about another payment . " You mean I still owe you money ? " " Mrs. Bowers , look at the way we put on the roof " " All right , see me tomorrow . " And the next day she paid him what he demanded without bothering to ask for the itemized bill . And two weeks after they moved in she and Sandy and assistants unpacked the goods and watched the interior take on an imperial splendor . Louisa Ellis , carrying Persia , stumbled about in exclamatory amazement or gaped like a beached fish as treasure after treasure was brought to view ; and now and then she sank to a box , overcome . But Eilley went ahead calmly , methodically , feeling that all these things were richly and rightly hers , and thinking of that day , not far off now , when she would take her place as the leader of Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself and Mr. Bowers . Sandy looked down from his crimson background as if suffering excruciating toothache ; but Eilley  --  it seemed to Louisa , at least  --  had the poise of a queen . To the parlor also she had men bring tables and chairs , and chose among the chairs a large one , handsomely upholstered , as her own ; because when visitors entered the parlor from the hall , she wanted them to see not only the portraits , done by a great Italian artist ,  | but also herself , the mistress of the house , sitting beneath them . If this parlor , and her own private one across the hall , did not impress Nevadans , then nothing under the sun could impress them . Louisa had been gawking in the huge library across the hall . She came to Eilley and whispered out of quavering agitation . " Stop mumbling at me , " said Eilley impatiently . " What on earth 's the matter with you ? " " Goodness , come and see ! " Eilley followed her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger at the ceiling . The master carpenters , the superb woodworkers whom she had employed , had intricately carved the moldings around the ceiling ; and as Eilley looked up at the handsome and painstaking craftsmanship , she knew that no matter what she had paid for this mansion , it had not been a cent too much . She went to other rooms , including the parlors and her bedchamber , and saw there beautiful designs that were even more elaborate . " And to think , " said Louisa , " that they did it with pocket-knives ! " " It 's beautiful , " said Eilley . " In Europe there 's nothing finer . " " And the door-knobs , " said Louisa , grasping one , " are they silver ? " " Solid silver from my own mine . " Eilley returned to the library and went over to look at her books . Some of them she herself had bought in England , choosing many atlases and encyclopedias ; but many of them she had told her contractor to buy and had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now gleamed at her in gold on morocco she had never heard of . The authors all seemed very foreign , but she reflected that they must be the best , even if unknown to Americans  --  God knows they had cost enough . Sandy had meekly entered and was looking at the handtooled rows . Hoping that Eilley would not expect him to read all those shining volumes , he sighed and withdrew . He was glad to flee outside to help with the plants that had been shipped from abroad . Eilley was thinking of the house-warming she would have . She had originally intended to have liveried servants , and a butler announcing guests from the hall ; but her trip to Europe  | had filled her with scorn of lying and fawning menials . The arrogant rascals had asked her how many times she had been divorced ; had inquired into the social station of Mr. Bowers before he found the ledge of silver ; and had smirked behind their hands . She would have no hirelings in her house . Her distinguished guests could come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisa , would wish to sit in the library and read those famous books ; others would stroll in the garden or swim in the hot pool . Louisa said the men would get drunk and then lie on the floor to stare up at the nymphs . " I wo n't stand drunkards in my home . " " Then you 'll need ladies . Without them men are pigs . " " Ladies , yes , but no frumps . " " Not women like that Nita . " " Nita who ? " " McCoy . That Indian girl who dances in the saloons . " " Of course not . " Eilley went out where her husband was bowed and sweating over a clump of heather and asked how many cases of champagne he had ordered . " Ten cases . " " Order fifty more and fifty boxes of the finest cigars . We ca n't afford to act like we 're poor people . " " All thet , " said Sandy thoughtfully , " will cost a lot of coin . " " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was thinkun ? " " Our house-warming will be the biggest social event in the country . It will make us the leaders here . " That was all true , Sandy reflected ; but he sometimes wished he was back in the Gold Canyon hut and did not have to scrub his face and hands so clean before drying them on Eilley 's fine linen . This mansion almost paralyzed him . There was not a chair in it on which he dared sit ; and when he looked at the big bed from England , and his spotless nightshirt laid out on it , he wanted to crawl into a dirty bunk in his underwear and sleep the sleep of a mule-skinner . When he thought of eating from the silver dishes ?  | Eilley was showing them to Louisa , piece by piece ; and Louisa was gasping . " Fifteen thousand dollars this set cost , not counting the silver , which came from my own mine . " " Fifteen thousand ! " " It was made by the best silversmith in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said it would be the finest set anywhere . He makes sets only for royalty , but when he learned who I was " I should think so ! " " ? then he promised me the finest . " " I guess Queen Victoria do n't have anything like this ! " " Not quite so fine , " Eilley admitted , setting the heavy items on the great dining room table . In the parlor she had a huge chair which , privately in her own mind , was to be her throne ; and when it was placed in position under the portraits she sat on it and asked Louisa to enter from the hall , as if she were a guest coming for the first time , and tell her what she thought . With Persia in her arms , Louisa came through the front door , glanced up at an enormous clock in the hallway , and looked into the parlor at Eilley . Louisa was overcome . For a moment she just stood gaping in the doorway , as if she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Eilley . " I never seen anything like it ! Is that how Victoria was ? " " She was in mourning . " " When you put on your Paris gowns  --  why , Nevada society , they wo n't know what to think . " Instead of meeting guests at the door , Eilley decided to sit in the parlor and allow them to enter informally and find her there . She employed a distant relative by marriage , a large fat woman named Betsy , as cook , and her husband , Jim , as gardener and keeper of the stable . When Betsy saw the silverware , she folded her arms . " You expect me to serve in them things ! "  | " Those are fashionable , Betsy . Do n't look so silly . They were made especially for me by the best silversmith in the world . " " It 's only how I feel , " Betsy said . " Just heft one of em . " " They 're solid silver from my own mine . " " If anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he 'll break his leg . " " Do n't talk so foolish . " " It 's just how I feel , " Betsy repeated . " Them things will tucker me out . " For the house-warming , Eilley sent invitations in her own handwriting ; and she gave particular care to the polite little note she addressed to a Mr. William Sharon , a banker newly arrived from San Francisco . Mr. Sharon , Louisa said , was very rich and very cultured , and had come over to buy some mines and establish a bank . When the great day came , Eilley said to her friend : " Louisa , get the clothes ready for Mr. Bowers . Sometimes he do n't seem to know what to wear . In Europe he showed up sometimes with his coat on wrongside out ; and once he got his shoes on the wrong feet . Lay his things out and then help me dress . " Helping Eilley dress was as exciting a thing as Louisa had ever done . The expensive Paris gown in heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon and a great puffing tunic held by a garland of apple blossoms , had been looked upon , Louisa remembered Eilley 's saying , by Napoleon himself . How much it had cost she did not dare ask . After Eilley put it on , and did her black hair up within a coronal , Louisa stepped back and clasped her hands . " Goodness me ! " " Do I look well ? " asked Eilley , and adorned herself with a diamond brooch and a diamond necklace . " Now we have to get Mr. Bowers ready . " Getting Sandy ready was much like currying and harnessing a mule . Eilley told him to take off his working clothes and wash himself well ; and when he came in from the hot pool , wearing a purple robe and looking half-drowned , she helped him into his tightfitting  | trousers with a strap under the instep ; his striped socks and stiff shirt ; his pointed slippers with elastic sides ; and his frock coat of broadcloth with cuffed sleeves , high lapels , and pleats on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar whose points supported his chin she put a black bow tie with long ends ; and up his shining front she set diamond studs as large as peas . His vest was of satin , low cut , and with flat revers . When dressed , Sandy looked full of deep and helpless anguish . If he turned his head , the collar stabbed him ; and when he moved , he had a starched sound from head to feet . He moved , not with dignity , as Eilley wished him to , but as if he were encased in armor . To see how he would look in all his glory , Eilley set a stovepipe hat on his oat-colored hair , and the two women stepped back to appraise him . " Do n't look so suffering-like , " said Louisa . " Huh ? " he said . He looked down and over himself as a boy gazes at his first long pants . He stood as if he could have been toppled like a wooden Indian . " Eilley ? " " It is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowers , " he said , staring at his varnished slippers , " them shoes hurts . " " Walk around in them . You need to break them in . " He walked as if his lower limbs were of wood . When they went downstairs Eilley marched over to sit on her big reception chair . " Where am Ito set ? " Sandy asked . " You 'll be in the library . After I receive the guests , they will go over to you . " He entered the library . He stretched his neck to relieve the pressure of the collar , and then stood gawking at the rows of books . This , he told himself , was a hell of a life ; and he slipped slyly outside where he had a bottle of brandy hidden in a pile of rocks . Louisa , meanwhile , had been enjoying everything with a mixture of malice and amazement . She thought it stupid of Eilley to dress hours before the guests would come ; and very wanton of Sandy to  | slip out now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water the plants . On one of his forays he lost a diamond stud and came in with a woebegone face to tell Eilley about it ; but Eilley said not to mind it , she would buy him a whole drawerful . Thereupon Louisa said Persia needed some air , and went out to look for the stud herself , whispering in her heart that finders were keepers.  | CHAPTER X X WHEN THE FIRST PERSONS CAME IN SIGHT , LOUISA VANISHED upstairs with Persia , and Sandy entered the library to stare solemnly at the books . Eilley ran to a parlor window to lift a drape and peer out , and felt as if she had been drenched with iced water when she saw that the first guests were men , already drunk , and improperly dressed . They had not been invited , but were foraging nobodies who had probably read Steve 's announcement of the party . There were three of them , and they were staggering up the path in profane astonishment , prodding one another and pointing at the trees and ponds . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , banging the great door against the hallway wall , and then bursting into vulgar raptures . Instead of looking into the parlor , they had turned to the right and espied Sandy ; and now they were pumping his hand and howling with joy . " You old warthog ! " roared one . " Where in hell 'd you get all them books ? " " God damn , Sandy , this is quite a shack ! Is that a hardwood floor ? " " The best ther is , " said Sandy . " And , Christ amighty , look at these books ! If that ai n't saddle leather I never saw none . " Then Eilley heard low whispers and sudden laughter . She was startled again , a few moments later , by a loud oath and a bellowing voice . The hoodlums had looked over at her Venetian mirrors and were shouting their amazement and delight . " By hell ! " said one , shoving Sandy against a table and almost knocking him down . " Look at that , will you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then drunken lewd whispering .  | Lewd laughter followed and then silence ; and she supposed the barbarians were telling vulgar stories . She was on the point of asking them to leave when they framed themselves in the parlor entrance . But they did not look at her . Their inebriated fancy was taken by the two portraits , and they stood gaping at them and leaning on one another . " Holy God ! " cried one . " Is that ole Sandy ? " Nobody answered ; and after another drunken appraisal , one of them yelled : " Hey , Sandy , come here ? " Sandy came meekly from the library ; and the three men gawked at the portraits , and Sandy peered across their shoulders at his wife . Her face was stormy with anger . It was so full of outrage and pain that he was unable to take his eyes off it , but stared as if hypnotized ; and all the while the men were yelling questions in his ears . " Sandy , is that you , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural , does he ? " " Jesus , he 's all dressed up ! " " Fit to kill . Sandy , is them real clothes you got on ? " Sandy 's peeking gaze had been caught by his wife 's and fixed ; and he stood there paralyzed , with none of him visible to Eilley except his head from his eyes up . He could not have looked more sheepish and scared if in this moment his hands had been in the pockets of the men who stood in front of him . He could not have spoken to save his life . He was still looking at her when Eilley rose . " Mr. Bowers ? " she said . He did not speak or move ; and the men , as if only now becoming aware of Eilley , fixed their drunken stares on her . " Mr. Bowers ! " she said more sharply , and walked around the men as if to seize her husband and hold him up to view . " Are these men friends of yours ? " " Unh-huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thet is ? " He swallowed again and blurted : " They used to be , thet is ! " " Mr. Bowers , tell them to leave ! "  | The men were frightfully drunk , but they understood vaguely what Eilley had said . Her words astonished them even more than the portraits had ; and now they gawked at her as if trying to make out whether she was animal or plant . Sandy stepped back away from them and drooped , a forlorn fellow caught halfway between obedience to his wife and loyalty to his friends . These men were old saloon buddies who had come to his party because they had thought he would want them to come . " Huh ? " asked one of them , blinking owlishly . As if unable to make sense of this , he turned to Sandy and asked : " What 's a-matter your missus ? " " She wants you to go , " Sandy said . " Go ! Why , good Christ , we just got here ! Hey , " he yelled , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what time is it ? Sandy , ai n't you got no clocks around here ? " " Will you men please leave ? " asked Eilley , speaking as calmly as she could . " Leave , " said the spokesman . He looked at his companions to see what they made of that . They all looked at one another and wagged their heads in droll bewilderment . Eilley stepped forward and took the arm of one of them . She led him toward the door and he went obediently , still wagging his head in astonishment and grief ; and the other two trailed after him . At the door Eilley shoved outside the one she had been guiding and half-supporting ; and then in turn she pushed the other two after him . She slammed the door behind them and turned to face her husband . " Honest ! " he cried , deciding it would be tactful to speak first . " Honest what , Mr. Bowers ? " " Well " Are these the kind of friends you have ? Are these the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never invited them , " he said , shaking his head vigorously . " Then why did n't you tell them to leave ? " " Well ? "  | " Mr. Bowers , go back to the library . " Sandy went quickly to the library ; and when out of sight of Eilley , he went to a window to peer out . There his old buddies sat on the lawn , arguing furiously , and wildly cuffing one another in the heat of what they were saying . One of them repeatedly thrust an unsteady arm at the house , and when he did so , another seized his arm and fell upon it and strove to pin it to the ground . It was clear to Sandy that they were wildly debating the reasons for their expulsion ; and as Sandy watched them , his throat filled with grief and his heart with pain . When some other guests came , and went across to the parlor to talk with Eilley , Sandy grasped his opportunity and stole outside . He thought he would find his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had risen and staggered away into the night ; and looking out across the darkness of the hills , he could in fancy see them going arm in arm and wagging their heads and trying to understand . It was the fact that they did not understand , but had gone away in amazement and pain , that hurt Sandy Bowers in the simple soul of the man where loyalty to friends was for him the chief of all virtues . Hidden out by the stables he had a large bottle of brandy . For a moment he listened to the gay revelry inside , knowing that he should return and try to be the kind of husband Eilley wished him to be ; but he could not return . He could not go in and talk gaily with the snobbish guests who had been invited , remembering all the while that three old friends had been shown the door . And so he stole softly through the dark , going quickly from tree to tree and glancing back , fearful that Eilley had found him gone and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drink alone . For he had been touched where pride lay deepest in him , and had been wounded to the depth of that pride . But before finding his bottle , he slipped into a stable and slunk forward in the warmth of darkness that was full of the homely smell of beasts . Up and across the back of a horse he put his arms and put a cheek to the hair ; and not until then did he know that  | he had been weeping . There was moisture under his cheek , and he was surprised to discover that there were tears in his eyes . There was , he realized now , a hot and aching constriction in his throat . His hands patted the beast 's hide and move caressingly along the back ; because a horse was one thing that Sandy understood and loved . He went forward at last to see if the animals had plenty to eat , and for a few moments he stroked their necks and listened to their big strong teeth grinding the hay . He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid that Eilley or Louisa or another would be looking for him . Instead of going back to the door , he climbed into the manger and through it ; and then fetched his bottle and sat by a pile of hay . After taking a deep drink , he felt a little better . Presently it occurred to him that it would be a smart thing to burrow in the hay and drowse there and drink and remember the years when he had been happier than he was now . No one would think of kicking into the hay to discover him there . He would lie here in a fragrant mow and probably get as drunk as a fool . And that is what Sandy did . At every melancholy thought he drew deeply from the bottle and wiped his mouth and sighed ; and after a while he thrust the bottle out of the hay and held it up to the light . He was a little troubled to perceive that he had drunk half of it  --  for it took a lot of brandy to see an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne and brandy and whisky by the case , but there was no way of stealing another bottle from that horde . He had no friend there who would thieve and lie for him if he tiptoed to the back door . It was long past midnight when Sandy drained the last drop from his bottle and then held the bottle to his lips , hoping for a miraculous replenishing . He did not know how drunk he was until he came pawing out of the mow , intent on raiding the kitchen , and feeling fearfully bold . He staggered to his feet , swaying dizzily , and set off toward the house ; but on his way he perceived that he was covered with wisps of hay . If he entered the kitchen and were  | caught , he would be a pretty sight  --  with hay in his hair and pockets , and hayfield dust powdered all over him . He was rocking back and forth on his heels , considering this dilemma and listening to the music inside , when he bethought himself of the swimming pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash his face and hands . On the brink of the pool he teetered drunkenly and stared at the black water ; and suddenly , for no reason that was ever to become clear to him , he fell in . He fell headlong as if he had been struck a blow , and then gurgled and floundered and believed beyond all doubt that he was drowning . Pawing desperately and blowing like a whale , he reached a side of the pool and grasped the rim of a trough ; and there he lay , limp and scared , wondering what had happened to him . After struggling out and getting to his feet , he thought of his diamonds and ran a trembling hand up and down his shirt front ; whereupon , like a chastened and terrified lad , he made a bee-line for the front door . Eilley 's guests had gone , and she was sitting in her chair , looking like an old queen who had weathered a score of civil wars , when an apparition in the hallway fetched her up with a cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sad and woebegone creature with water dripping from his chin to his collar , from his limp hands to the floor . " Why , Mr. Bowers ! " she cried . " What on earth ails you ? " " I guess I slipped , " he said . " Goodness in heaven ! " said Eilley , and marched over to look at him . The diamonds were all gone from his shirt . His fine broadcloth suit sagged under its load of water . And when he moved at last , stiffly , as if expecting to slip again , his varnished shoes pumped water up his ankles . She had intended to scold him , saying that this was a fine way for a gentleman to act ; but he looked so terribly humbled , so chastened , so blankly astonished to find himself in this predicament , that she took his dripping arm and led him to the parlor . She sat and pulled him down and he knelt at her feet , a drenched and speechless suppliant ;  | and after looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What on earth happened to you ? " " I slipped , " he said . " I was out ther a-walkun around and I slipped ; and I guess I about drownded . I had a fearful time . " He looked around him apprehensively and asked : " Are they all gone ? " " Yes . " He sighed . He felt better then . Staring down his wet bosom , he said sheepishly : " Gosh , I lost all them-ther jools . " " Never mind , " said Eilley . " You have a lot more . " She leaned forward and touched a cheek to his mop of wet hair . " You poor dear ! We must get you in some dry clothes . " Sandy was amazed and delighted . He had expected a dreadful scolding ; and he rose now , deciding that getting drunk and falling headlong into a pool was nothing at all . Still , he had lost a whole handful of diamonds . " Soon 's it 's daybreak , " he said cheerfully , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost a fearful lot of coin . " " Do n't worry about them , " said Eilley , and preceded him up the stairs .  | CHAPTER XXI IN HIS NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT OF HER HOUSE-WARMING , STEVE GILPIN dubbed her Queen of the Comstock . Eilley liked the phrase because she was determined to be the undisputed leader of society in Nevada . Her mine was now paying at the rate of a million dollars a year ; she had a mansion splendidly furnished ; she had a gift of second sight . In short , circumstances had already placed her far in the lead of all competitors and she was resolved to stay there . Her canny mind told her that she would have to do much more than sit in her mansion and receive visitors . She would have to entertain ; and her entertainments , in their lavishness and decorum , would have to be the kind that all her rivals would emulate . Much more than all this , she must take the twin cities under her personal direction ; for she knew that leaders had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people within their province . During the first week after the party , she laid her plans . One of her problems was her husband . On the night of the housewarming he had got as drunk as an owl and had fallen head over heels into a fish pond , and she realized it was not going to be easy to teach him to act like a gentleman . Of course , broadcloth did not cost a great deal and he could have as many suits as he wished . She cared little about the clothes he ruined or the diamond studs he lost . She cared a great deal about his deportment at the table ; but perhaps he would learn after a while not to spill food down his satin vest , not to belch , and to talk of something besides mules and ranches . Perhaps , too , he would learn to read and write his name ; for as one of the giants of American finance , if not indeed as a banker , he would have many important papers to sign . But Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far was the task of ridding Virginia City of its gamblers and  | murderers and harlots . Even if she did nothing else , Eilley was determined to drive Julia Bulette back to the brothels she came from . There could be no culture , or even ordinary decency , in a city as long as a scarlet woman rode brazenly in a lacquered carriage , sat in a favored box at the opera house , acted as godmother of the fire company , and behaved as if all the important men were her husbands . How to drive the shameful strumpet out , Eilley did not know . She seemed to be the personal friend , and perhaps the mistress , of every important man in the two cities ; but at least in this , the expulsion of Julia , she could count on the devoted support of every respectable woman in the State . They all hated her as they hated nothing else in life . To get rid of her , and of bullies like Peel , Eilley decided , was the first thing that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole life of Virginia City . All that she had heard since her return home , from Louisa and others , had been scandalous . Louisa said there had been public exhibitions in which badgers and wildcats and dogs were tortured ; human beings were also tortured ; men got frightfully drunk and shot one another for no reason at all ; they seized the faro molls and almost raped them in public ; and as if these were not enough , wags like Steve Gilpin were pulling academic legs all over the world and giving Virginia City an odious reputation . Only recently , for instance , Steve had published a story which , he declared , epitomized the spirit of the towns . He heard there was a rumpus over at Broncho Sall 's and he hastened over ; and there he found a tall , gangling , yellow-haired young man , sagging in boredom and sucking at a pipe . " Has there been a big row over here ? ' " The fellow looked at me under long lashes as yellow as his hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess there mout a-been a little misunderstanding in Sall 's . Bout a jiffy ago I seed Wasatch Sam roll out o ther and seed him spit out some feller 's ear . But I doan reckon there 's been no partikler row . Leastwise I ai n't seed nothun o none . ' " That , ' I said to him , is nothing at all . '  | " Nothun , ' he said . Leastwise nothun to write about ' " Stove 's stories were copied by newspapers all over the land . He had written of traveling stones in a Nevada valley , impelled by some strange magnetic force ; at the spring solstice they all moved toward a common center and piled up there in a quivering mass ; and when the autumn solstice came , they all disentangled themselves and returned to their original bases . Barnum wrote at once that he would give Steve ten thousand dollars to make the stones perform under a circus tent . German physicists were so excited that they proposed an expedition to study the phenomenon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that during daylight hours was like any other plant ; but when dusk approached , it became an eerie and unbelievable thing . Then it took on an unearthly efflorescence and became a weird light in the desert . Credulous botanists came to Nevada to study it . He wrote of a stupendous windmill on the top of Sun Mountain ; and engineers in Boston figured out the exact horsepower , and engineers in Chicago said their city needed one like it . He wrote of what he called a solar armor , a protective helmet to wear while crossing the desert or other areas of excessive heat . Within the head-piece was a small ammonia tank ; and evaporation of the ammonia , the degree of which was mechanically controlled , cooled and refreshed the air . The inventor of this instrument , his newspaper story declared , started across a Nevada desert in August , and was found frozen to death . He had waited too long to remove the helmet and had been refrigerated by his own superb ingenuity . The London Times gave this gadget a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government declared that soldiers ought to be equipped with the helmet for service in India and Africa . Nor was Steve the only hoaxer writing preposterous legends which amazed a gullible world . On the Enterprise with him now was a small and sober-faced wag whose stories were signed " Josh " but whose real name seemed to be Samuel Clemens . Only a few days ago , he had published a front-page story of a fiendish murder : a mother and seven children had been butchered by a demented  | father with an axe , and the father had then killed himself . The editor of the Gold Hill paper had swallowed the story hook , line , and sinker ; and when he discovered that it was another Josh hoax , his fury went out of bounds . Eilley had been furious too . These silly yarns of Josh and Steve , copied throughout the land , and even by newspapers abroad , would soon make of Virginia City nothing but a place of monstrous and malicious liars . It would not do to have botanists and physicists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been pulled . They would go home and report that Virginia City was a nest of madmen and fools . In fact , Eilley wondered if it would not be wise to chase Steve and Clemens out with the murderers and harlots . She would see Steve and have a talk with him . When she entered the rickety shanty where the Enterprise had its office , the little man known as Josh was in a devilish tantrum . He was carrying on so that Eilley paused on the threshold to stare at him and listen to his torrential outburst . " Such vile and abominable minds as I live around ! " he was howling in a high cracked voice . " Such niddering nits , base and craven and crafty , and fit only to be serfs and lackeys , slaves and liegemen , cupbearers and stable grooms ! " He seemed to be searching for something . He walked around solemnly , peering into the most Improbable places and pausing now and then to reflect . Steve and the other editors paid no attention to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life on fatuous and feeble nondescripture that he calls quaints ! A lazar among intellectuals , a piddling and paltry philogynist , a hobsnobbing litteratourist among dull books and spiritual megrims ! His idea of a jest , a prank , a witticism is to hide a man 's pipe ! " After another long moment of searching he let out an awful howl . " The damned sterile curse of a man ! ? who can find no worthier test of his inventive faculties than to hide a pipe ! A molehill and fleabite of a fellow , pitiable , contemptible , fribbling and niggardly , with a catchpenny mind and a trinket for a soul ; a dawdling sluggard sunk in his own stupor , sired by a coma and foaled by a trance ! A hackneyed  | purveyor of logomachy , designed to intrigue all the dolts and tomfools in a land where chuckleheads run for office and lackbrains make the laws ! And he calls it wit ! " Slowly he searched as if half-paralyzed with wrath . " This master of mystagogy , this narcotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedridden practice of hiding pipes ? " Unexpectedly he found his pipe and marched back quietly to his desk . Looking up , Steve saw Eilley standing in the doorway . " Hello ! " he called . " Come on in . " " I wish to talk to you , " said Eilley . Steve rose and placed a chair for her . " Of course . You can talk here . Do n't pay any attention to these fellows , " he said , observing that her gaze was fixed on Josh . " They have no minds . Just give them their pipes and they suck away until they go to sleep . " " I wanted to see you alone . " " You imbeciles clear out , " said Steve . " Mrs. Bowers wants to talk to me . " Josh and two other men gathered their pipes and left . Steve grinned at Eilley . " Josh is a great fellow . Every day I hide his pipe just to hear him rant . " " Is n't he the one who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's the one . " Eilley sat and looked at Steve . He was such a sardonic clown of a man that she hardly knew how to make him understand her problem . " Steve , " she said , " I want to talk about Virginia City . It gets worse all the time  --  and you are one of the men who make it that way . Why do you write these awful lies and give us a bad reputation all over the world ? " " You mean my quaints ? " " I mean your lies about stones and windmills and helmets ? " " Those are n't lies , Eilley . Those are fables . Every fable tells a truth and preaches a sermon . Besides " They are plain lies , Steve , and you know it . As a newspaper editor you should help me to make Virginia City a respectable place ,  | and not fill your paper with silly shameful stories . We have the richest mines in the world and we can have the finest city . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Eilley , momentarily losing her temper . " We have a vulgar camp of thieves and murderers and prostitutes and gamblers . It 's shameful . And you only make matters worse " Listen , " said Steve . " If you have the notion that you can reform this place , then you might as well go sit in Carson River and try to hold the stream back with your hands . Virginia City is a ripsnorting hell-for-leather bedlam and nobody can ever make it anything else . Why should anybody want to ? I love it . Every day I find something that makes my hair stand on end . It 's wild and vital and tremendous like the ocean , like the winds , like love and anger , fire and flood ? " " It 's disgraceful ! It 's vulgar and sinful and brutal . Do you mean to tell me you want it to be the way it is now ? " " I would n't change a single hair on its head . And besides , Eilley , you ca n't change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Virginia City will romp along spitting fire and eating dynamite until every ounce of silver is taken out . Why do n't you stay over there in your fine house and not worry about it ? " " It 's my city too , " she said severely . " It 's more my city than it is yours or anybody 's ; and I 'm going to make it a respectable and decent city . " " How ? " " I 'm going to drive the gamblers and harlots out of it . I 'm going to chase that Julia Bulette clear back to the Gulf . " " Eilley , you go get you a thousand pigs . You drive them alone from here to Salt Lake City . If you can do that , then you can make Virginia City respectable . But you 'll have to drive us all out . You 'll have to drive Pete O'Reilley out , for he 's crazy , and he 's digging a hole into the mountain . You 'll have to drive another man out because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tunnel through the mountain and light it with mirrors so we wo n't have sunset at three in the afternoon . You 'll have to drive a third man out because he is going to build a bulkhead around the city to shut out the winds . You 'll have to drive Sutro out because he 's also going to dig a tunnel . Eilley , if  | you want to make things better , why do n't you start with your own mine ? Men die in it like bugs in a prairie fire . " " My mine is just as good as any mine here . " " They 're all death-traps . " " It 's Virginia City I 'm talking about , not the mines . " " Eilley , I 'm going to tell you a fable . You know what the Gould and Curry has done . It has made a beautiful spot over here on a ledge of stone . It has a small lake lined with blue tile ; fountains ; terraces covered with flowers . Two hundred feet down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosscuts , dying of poison and coughing their lungs out . It takes a ton of silver and ten dead men to produce one of those flower gardens . " " I do n't see any sense in what you say , " Eilley declared , gazing at his cynical face . " Then I 'll give you another fable . Out in the desert I could show you a million snakes with lizards fastened on their throats . I could show you wasps laying their eggs in the live bodies of tarantulas . I could show you vultures eating the heart out of sick old sheep . I could show you God 's divine plan over the whole Nevada desert ; or I could show you His plan in Virginia City . It is all cut out of the same cloth . " " You 're just talking more nonsense . " " I see you do n't like fables . It 's just as easy to change the lizards and wasps and vultures as it is to change the animal called man . You could drive the lizards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to another town ; but any time you make one city respectable , you just raise hell with another city . You can move human beings but you ca n't make them over . If you drive the sinful people out , they will go to Salt Lake City , and then Brigham Young will drive them to Chicago . Do you , " asked Steve , grinning , " want them all in Chicago ? " Eilley looked at him steadily for a long moment . " Then you mean you wo n't help me ? " " I would n't help you try to stop Carson River with your hands . " Eilley rose and looked down at him . She had heard enough . " All right , " she said , " I do n't need your help . I 'll do it myself . "  | CHAPTER XXII ON HER WAY HOME THERE CAME TO EILLEY A DARING THOUGHT : IF it became necessary , she would buy the newspapers , and every building that housed a saloon or a brothel ; and she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to explore the city and find out what it was like after dark . Louisa said it was a roistering carnival of loose women and drunken men . She said its entertainment , even in the most respectable places , was enough to make a wooden Indian blush . Eilley resolved to see for herself . On July 2nd in this year of 1863 , Maguire 's Opera House had opened its doors . In its splendor , this building was more magnificent than the International Hotel or any of the saloons . It had a huge stage , illumined by gas footlights in cabbage-leaf sconces ; great crystal chandeliers ; and on either side a double tier of boxes in scarlet brocade , with velvet railings and gilt ; chairs . Off the foyer were billiard parlors , smoking-rooms , gaming tables , and a mahogany bar inlaid with ivory . The curtain was a colorful representation of Lake Tahoe . Most of the wealthy residents were proud of Maguire 's . They could sit in their ornate boxes and look coldly down at the parquet or across at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a performance . She drove up in her lacquered brougham , attended by a liveried footman , and sat in her box , half-smothered with furs and jewels ; and across from her sat the respectable women of the two cities . Eilley rented the best box available . She had already bought a fine carriage and blooded horses ; and she had a footman whom Mr. Bowers spoke of as " thet horse-skinner . " For their first appearance at Maguire 's , she had a florist send all his rarest flowers to her box ; and she and Sandy dressed in the finest clothes they had bought in  | Paris . She told Sandy to wear a cane and his eyeglass ; for herself she chose a large blue fan . " What , " asked Sandy , " is this-here show about ? " " Louisa , what is on this evening ? " " A dog-fight , I guess . Or maybe it 's a badger fight . " " I thought it was a drama . " " Oh , they had that last week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wildcat fight . " " In the opera house ? " said Eilley . " Maybe it 's a bulldog and a boar . It says in the paper . " When they entered , most of the boxes were filled . On their right was John Mackay , sitting alone ; on their left were the Coreys . Above them , but hidden by Eilley 's flowers , was a dapper little gentleman whom she had caught a glimpse of when she entered her box . He was William Sharon , the great banker from San Francisco . Across the house sat Julia Bulette with a monstrous crimson fan . Eilley had been seated only a few moments when there was sudden excitement below . On the far side , a well-armed rascal had espied an enemy sitting on the opposite side ; and without warning he yanked out a huge pistol and began to fire . Five times his gun blazed . Men in the parquet were so incensed or terrified by the wild shooting that some of them drew weapons and leapt to chairs and cursed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at John Mackay . " John , what is all this noise about ? " " A Unionist , " he said quietly , " is shooting at a secesh . " Two attendants ushered the murderous Unionist outside . Men who had fled across the footlights returned . Women who had been leaning down from boxes settled back as if this sort of thing happened daily in their lives at this hour . The manager , coming from behind the curtain , seemed undisturbed . He was sorry , he said , for the rumpus , but nobody had been hurt , and the two gentlemen had promised to do their shooting outside . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he went on , " you know it is the aim of this opera house to give you the best entertainment in the world .  | Last week we gave you a play called Money , and you did not like it very much ; so this evening we are going to give you something better than an Englishman 's idea of humor . " You are all acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hero . You have seen him fight . He has killed every wildcat and lynx , wolf and coyote , badger and fighting dog that we have matched against him . Tonight we have some cats that are bigger and stronger and meaner than any you ever saw ; and I am sure you will be royally entertained . " But before we bring on Hero , and a man-eating monster of the jungles called Giant Powder , we offer you a preliminary between that murderous pup , Go-Get-Em , and that flesh eating demon of lightning , Young Winnemucca ! " The curtain went up to reveal a large wire cage with eight gas jets in its ceiling . A moment later it was opened and into it was thrust Young Winnemucca , a huge cat that squatted and hissed , showing its teeth to the spectators . It looked like a willing beast . At an unexpected noise it leapt ten feet and turned with its hair on end . When stage hands fetched Go-Get-Em , a large yellow bulldog , they set him on the floor outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a fighting lust . Go-Get-Em was full of slobbering eagerness . He thrust his ugly muzzle against the cage wire and drooled with impatience . Eilley divided her attention between the arena and the wealthy persons in the boxes around her , reflecting meanwhile on this barbarous spectacle in the only opera house in her city . She peered round at John Mackay ; he looked bored . But in her husband 's face , and in most of the other faces which she could see , there was excitement , fascinated intentness , an inhuman ferocity of emotion that chilled her . Men and women , fashionably dressed , were leaning forward and waiting for the moment when one beast would slaughter another ... . " Ladies and gentlemen , you will now see a fight to the finish between Go-Get-Em , the best bulldog in the world except Hero ,  | and Young Winnemucca , a deer-eating wildcat from the Sierras ! May the best man win  --  whether dog or cat ! " The cage door was opened , and with a primal surge like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Winnemucca was caught off guard and rolled like a ball of fur halfway across the cage ; but almost instantly , before spectators could realize the deadly swiftness of the battle , Go-Get-Em fell free of the wild teeth and rolled over , stone dead . The silence was broken by a lone shout of rage that touched off the men in the parquet . They rose to their feet , howling like mad . What , they demanded to know , were they paying their coin for ? ? to see a sick old dog make one limping assault and roll over as if poisoned ? The manager shouted for silence but the multitude shook fists at him , climbed to their seats , threatened his life , and acted as if they had been cheated of their life 's savings . " Gentlemen ! " the manager shouted . He waved his arms like a windmill . " Gentlemen ! " " Let him speak ! " cried one . " Gentlemen , I know how disappointed you are ! We ca n't always know ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the best fighters ? " " He 's dead , ai n't he ? " " Yes , " admitted the manager , turning an aggrieved stare on GoGet-Em , " But , gentlemen , that was only a preliminary ! Tell me : do you want Hero matched against Young Winnemucca or Giant Powder ? " Some called for one and some for the other . " Gentlemen , I think Giant Powder will last longer , but it 's your money " Giant Powder ! " they yelled , and Young Winnemucca was bagged and taken out . Giant Powder looked the part . Larger than the other cat , with a scowling embittered face , he stood foursquare and ready . When Hero was led forth , the parquet gave him a mighty cheer . They had  | seen him fight . They knew him as the most savage dog in Nevada . Indeed , there were legends about this monster with his ugly pleated face , his thick bowed legs , and his hatred of cats . It was said that Hero ate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would attack anything that moved . Greedy for battle , he was now eyeing the cat , and the cat was arching its back and growling . " Ladies and gentlemen , are you ready ? " " Yes , God damn it ! What do you think we 're here for ? " " You will now see a finish fight between Hero , champion of all fighting dogs from here east or west to the international dateline ; and Giant Powder , the worst man-eating cat that ever came down the Yuba ! If you do n't get your money 's worth , stop at the box office on your way out ! " Hero was no foolish and unpracticed warrior like Go-Get-Em . Upon entering the cage , he did not streak across in greenhorn fashion , but walked over , cautious , alert , as if to feel out his enemy 's power and tactics . Giant Powder stood by the wire , back arched , teeth bared , and eyes like two green lights . For what seemed a long moment , dog and cat looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in the next instant like a bolt of lightning he was on his foe . It was such a terrific onslaught that human eyes could not clearly see what was happening . Leaning forward , his hands clutching the rail , his breath panting as if he fought too , Sandy saw only one apparently inseparable ball of fur , rolling over and over with astonishing speed , and sounding like exploding firecrackers . When the ball of fur struck the side of the cage , there was a piercing yowl from the cat , a murderous answer from the dog ; and then in a flash of yellow the cat leapt free and darted up the side of the cage . Four feet up , the beast clung to the wire and hissed , looking down at its enemy ; and Hero , drooling with battle lust , looked up . There was a brief hush . Then attendants ran forward and thrust with sticks , and with bared teeth and claws the cat looked so dreadful that spectators rose and cheered . Men poked sticks against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its claws clung to the wire . They jabbed at its face , its flashing teeth , its eyes . Suddenly , with a wild scream , it leapt to the floor ; and again cat and dog were one ball of explosions and fury . After the cat had climbed the wire three times , and three times had been knocked down , its tawny fur had red patches on it ; and Hero looked more like a gory monster than a dog . Men below were wagering now . It was a good fight . Again and again across the stage rolled the two beasts , the dog striving for the cat 's throat , the cat ripping the dog 's flesh open with claws and teeth . The terrible sound of them chilled Eilley through and through . She looked at her husband , who was beside himself with excitement , his hands clutching the rail so hard that knuckles were white . She looked again at John Mackay , but he was as calm and imperturbable as an Indian ; at Julia who was leaning down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who behaved as if out of their minds . She remembered Steve 's fables of the desert . The end came suddenly . Nobody was surprised when Hero finally stood braced on his stout legs , his teeth sunk in Giant Powder 's throat . In the parquet , and in many of the boxes , men and women rose and cheered . They hugged one another and wept with joy . Feeling sickened , and numbed by deep helpless anger , Eilley stood up . She told Mr. Bowers they would go now ; and when Mr. Bowers faced her , she was horrified . He had been slobbering on his shirt . His face was flushed ; his eyes were not the eyes of a man . " Mr. Bowers , what is the matter with you ? " " Thet , " cried Sandy , chattering with excitement , " was a good fight ! " Eilley shrugged . On her way out she touched John Mackay 's arm . " John , what did you think of it ? " Mackay gave her a faint enigmatic smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made her wonder too . She resolved to take a hand in the management of Maguire 's , even if she had to buy the theater . She would throw out all these barbarous spectacles , and bring to the city great artists and lecturers . When in New York she had read of a Miss  | Antoinette Adams , a singing star from Boston ; she would use her influence to have Miss Adams presented on an early program . Eilley was so shocked by her night at the Opera House that she wondered what kind of entertainment was offered in the more fashionable saloons ; and during the next few days Louisa was full of horrified gossip about these places . Louisa said , though , that society went to the Black Crook ; and one day she came to Eilley with the Virginia City newspaper and pointed at a large advertisement . Eilley read : JESUS CHRIST Will Make His First and Only Appearance IN VIRGINIA CITY at the BLACK CROOK THEATER This Evening Come One  --  Come All " The Biggest Time of Your Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " asked Eilley . " Goodness , do n't ask me ! Maybe the Lord has come again . " " Louisa , go over in my carriage and find out what this is . " When Louisa returned she was agog . A man , she said , had come to Virginia City , declaring that he was Jesus , and was going to purge the place of its wickedness . The boys , including Steve and that Josh man and other wags , had taken him in hand and given him the best suite at the International Hotel ; and this evening he was going to preach a sermon in the Black Crook . " Does he really think he 's the Lord ? " asked Eilley in astonishment . " That 's what they say . Steve says maybe he is the Lord . " When Eilley and Sandy entered the Black Crook that evening , the place was already crowded to the doors and all the tables were occupied ; but Steve Gilpin saw her enter and came over . He said  | they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again that strange little man with the solemn face and twinkling eyes , bushy hair and brows and mustache , and nervous hands . " Have you met Josh ? " asked Steve . " Mr. Sam Clemens is the name he was born to . " " I saw him the other day , " said Eilley stiffly . She was not interested in Mr. Clemens . He was only another hoaxer who wrote absurd fables . After a moment , she observed that the man seemed to be looking with sly astonishment at her clothes . She was encased in a tight bodice with enough lace fichu stuffed in the V-neck to cover a tent . She had a blue skirt with six deep ruffles lying upon the hoops like canvas across wagon bows . Over her shoulders was a black lace Spanish mantilla . It was by no means one of her handsomest outfits but she had thought it good enough for a saloon . Why Mr. Clemens was so fascinated by her garments she could not imagine ; and presently she ignored him and looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sage Hen was standing at the bar , drinking with men ; and at a table in a far corner sat the Indian girl , Nita CcCoy , and the murderer , Farner Peel . " What is Nita McCoy doing now ? " asked Eilley . " She dances in the Melodeon . She 's Farner Peel 's woman . " " Bawd and paid for , " said the man called Josh . Eilley ignored the jest . " When is this foolish man to appear ? " she asked . " Does he really think he is Jesus ? " " Maybe he is , " said Steve . " When Jesus comes again , nobody knows how He will come or what He will look like . Virginia City is a good place for the Lord to come to if He wants to find out how much good His first coming did . " " He must be crazy . " " I assure you , " said josh , turning his droll face her way , " that he does n't even have concupisense . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at Josh and wondering about the man . He had patiently studied a lot of men since Eilley had told him a few of them were cultured and most of them were  | not . Whether Mr. Clemens was a gentleman he could not tell . Physically , he looked much like himself  --  a small man with sloping shoulders and hands that did not look powerful ; but he used tremendous words and spoke as if he knew what they meant . Steve had given a sly signal , and over to their table marched the bartender . It was Luff McCoy , his great belly immaculately round under white linen , his red face flushed by whisky and goodwill . He brought champagne juleps , Catawba squirts , sangarees , and turned to Eilley . " Hello , Eilley , " he said . " Hello , Sandy . " " Hello , Luff ! " said Sandy joyfully . " What 's all this you brung ? " " Something for your cough . " Luff stood looking down at Eilley , remembering that she had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowned at the drinks , but Sandy grinned sheepishly at Josh and set to . He tasted a julep , declared with humble joy that it was good , and gulped it ; and then he stared hopefully at a sangaree . Eilley was troubled . If the hundred-odd saloons in her city were all like this one , they were a hellish lot . The Black Crook smelled of the fumes of tobacco and alcohol and the sickening powder used by the faro wenches . Most of the people here were harlots or gamblers or parasitic idlers-about-town who divided their after-dark hours between saloon and brothel . Of the few persons whom she respected , not one was here ; and she began to feel that her own presence was a blunder . Had Louisa been lying when she said that society frequented the place ? Had Louisa urged her to come here for the malicious pleasure of humiliating her ? " Is it true , " she asked impatiently of Steve , " that this foolish man is going to preach a sermon ? " " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hell . " " Anybody in his right senses will agree to that . When does he speak ? " " Any minute now . " Eilley turned to the stage and saw that three roughnecks and three harlots had come forward on it , each carrying a knotted mahogany  | club ; and these after a moment they waved aloft as batons and sang a hymn . Their voices were drunkenly off key . Halfway through the hymn they gave up and fell into furious argument among themselves ; whereupon , having reached an agreement , they burst into " Give Me Jesus . " When they finished , the audience broke into ugly yells ; and a giant of a man , drunk , dirty , and evil of countenance , parted the curtains and came forward . " Ladeez and gentamun , " he said , " I have a nouncement to make . Silence , you sons-a-bitches ! " He gazed fiercely at hoodlums who were booing him . " Ladeez and gentamun , we got a grand visiter in Virginee City this night . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth agin . He 's come to Virginee City to tell us how sinful we be . Now I ask you , ladeez and gentamun , to be perfect quiet while the Lord makes his entrance . " A hush fell . From backstage there now entered the deluded simpleton who thought he was Jesus . He was a tall cadaverous man , bearded , uncombed , his eyes afire . He was escorted between two strumpets robed as angels in long white gowns . They were grinning with drunken impish glee , but the pale thin man between them looked as if he were the shepherd of all the woes of earth . He gazed out and across the scornful multitude  --  as if remembering that bitter hour when he knelt in Gethsemane or that day when he carried a cross . The harlots with slow mincing step brought him to the edge of the stage ; and there for a moment he stood , looking into space . He was ready to speak but he was in no hurry ; and before he opened his mouth , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The two men grasped his arms . One of them was the dirty giant who had made the announcement . " Ladeez and gentamun , we got Jesus right here atwixt us ! He come bold-faced right into our city to make us quit our sinful ways ! The last time he come to earth he should ought to a-learned not to leave heaven agin ; but here he is ! We aim to give you Jesus tonight cause we do n't want him ! " In a dismal croaking voice they began to sing , " Give me Jesus " ;  | and as they sang , one laid his club in a resounding whack across the astounded man 's skull and hurled him toward the other , saying , " Take him , I do n't want him ! " Then the other clouted the poor fellow and thrust him back , saying , " Take him , I do n't want him ! " At every savage blow with a club the audience cheered . Again and again they struck the bewildered and helpless man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttocks ; and all the while , hurling him from club to club , they bawled the hymn . Blood ran down the man 's face and clothes but he made no effort to escape or to fight his tormentors . Like a creature of sawdust he sagged , his knees buckling ; but the two men kept him on his feet and continued clouting him . Steve was watching the faces around him . The gloating passion in them was the kind nobody ever saw in the face of a beast . Sandy gazed at the spectacle , fascinated ; and so , indeed , did Eilley , for this unexpected turn of events had paralyzed her will . On the stage the man had slumped to the floor , red with his own blood , and almost unconscious ; and the multitude was thunderously cheering . And still Eilley sat , unable to move or speak , unable to believe that such a brutal flogging could take place before her eyes in her own city . It was Nita McCoy who came to life like a tigress . Howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stage when Nita leapt to the table at which she had been sitting . " You cowards ! " she screamed at the men . " You yellow-livered sons-a-bitches ! You call yourselves men but you are lower than the bottom of a privy hole ! " The men halted in their stampede and gaped in astonishment at this wild girl who was spitting her contempt at them . " You torture a poor silly bastard , but not one of you has the guts to fight a man ! You scum and manure , you cowards rotten in your guts , you filth and snot of the earth ! You 're lower than dogs that squirt on the side of a building ! " Trembling as if she , too , had been flogged , she stood on the table , her black eyes loathing them ; and in amazement they looked at her . In a voice of  | utter contempt , in loathing that was thick with its own glut , she cried : " There is n't a man in this saloon tonight ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell back , and harlots dragged the bleeding man off the stage . As if coming to herself out of a long sleep , Eilley rose . She turned toward the door and Sandy followed , offering a sheepish goodnight to Luff on the way out . She went to her carriage and entered it without speaking ; and without speaking she drove home , with Sandy sitting at her side , mournfully unhappy and a little frightened . He was afraid Eilley had gone daft again . On her face was the look she had worn during those first bleak days in the London hotel . On arriving home she went straight to her bedchamber , paying no attention to Louisa who had been waiting for her . She undressed as if her hands obeyed only from habit and climbed into bed ; and all night she lay awake , trembling , sick , and unable to blot out the spectacle that burned like the core of hell in her mind .  | CHAPTER XXIII THREE THINGS EILLEY BOWERS LOVED , AND WHAT SHE LOVED SHE possessed and controlled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her will and her pride and her joy in living . She loved her husband , the child Persia , and Virginia City . She was a woman of strong opinion and inflexible purpose ; and for her the right and the wrong of earth , the good and the bad , the noble and the base , the heroic and the craven , the beautiful and the ugly , were all as clearly divided from one another , and as unmistakable , as day and night . Not for any price in the world could she have been guilty of a thought or an act or a word that would have outraged her sense of what was fitting and right . And the things she loved  --  a man , a child , and a city  --  she placed within a protective custodianship , and within the rigorous pattern of conduct that governed herself . When one of them behaved unworthily , the pain in her was no less than it would have been if she herself had been guilty . Her child was too young to err , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his love of drink ; but her city was a whoring and pimping rebel , a brutish monster of sin and wanton excesses and bad breeding . After seeing for herself what took place in its Opera House and in its favorite saloon , Eilley could have been no more angered and outraged if a grown son had murdered a blind man for a handful of coins ; if a grown daughter had come home with a bastard ; if her husband had lain in the embrace of Julia Bulette . For the city belonged to her . She had lived in Gold Canyon when there was no city ; she had been midwife at its birth , the mother of its infancy ; and now that it was a brawling and arrogant adolescent , it was trying to thrust her outside and slam the door in her face . For days , for weeks , after her terrible experience in the Black Crook , she did not leave her mansion ; and she was a deeply  | troubled and unhappy woman . How to take control of the city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which as the richest place on earth it ought to have , she did not know ; and she thought of the matter until her head ached and her emotions turned blindly on one another . She deliberated the possibility of inviting all the leaders to her house for a conference on civic planning ; but she knew they would not come . She thought of trying to buy all the principal buildings ; but she knew the owners would not sell . Then she fell back on the only course that was open to her : she would remain at home for a while and let the word go out that she was receiving , and perhaps one by one the business and social leaders would call and she would talk to them . If they did not come , she would be driven to seek them out . Sandy Bowers , meanwhile , was wretchedly unhappy . He loved that dirty and abandoned shack over in Gold Canyon where he had lived before he married Eilley . There he could hide a jug of brandy behind the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , refuse to brush his teeth or his hair , and cough to his heart 's content . Though worried by his cough , Eilley sometimes thought he hacked and groaned only to annoy her ; but when she rebuked him at night in the big bed , he hid his face in a pillow , trying to keep the sound from her , and nearly smothered to death . Over in the shack he could cough and spit , and be undisputed lord of four dirty walls . And as he loved the shack , he hated the mansion , though in his own bewildered and inarticulate way he was proud of it too . Perhaps what he hated most was his fine clothes . Day after day , week after week , he had to dress in his best and be ready to receive visitors ; because Eilley said they might come unexpectedly and both of them must be prepared . Week after week he sat around in his stiff garments , a lonely and miserable man who hardly dared move , who had nothing to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with diamonds shining down his front and a silly eyeglass hanging from his neck . If he had dared , he would have thrown them all into the fish pond outside .  | But Sandy Bowers also had things that he loved . As some men love children or women or a piece of land , he loved mules . He understood them and their ways . He loved to smell them , to hear them feed after a day of hard labor , to watch the relish with which they drank ; he loved to curry them until their hides were smooth and shining , to watch the anger in their eyes when he toyed with their huge ears , or their contentment when he raked their itching skins . All the mules he had ever owned or cared for had had their own names and personalities and endearing traits . Some men knew and loved one thing , some another ; Sandy knew and loved beasts . And one day , after weeks had passed and no visitors had come , and life in the big mansion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing in broadcloth and linen , and sitting around all day in memory and pain , he screwed his courage to the point of desperation and spoke . He said he thought it might not be a bad idea if he lived closer to the mine , where he could watch it ; and to his infinite joy , Eilley found the suggestion good . For all her canny shrewdness in many things , Eilley was often blind to the defects of character in the persons she loved ; and in her opinion , Mr. Bowers , in spite of his benighted and timid ways , had in him the makings of a financial wizard . In his two thick and clumsy hands she was willing to rest their fortune and let him start a bank or anything else he wished , believing that he would multiply their wealth tenfold . To his suggestion , therefore , she added another : " All right , Mr. Bowers , " she said , " and while you 're over there you 'd better look around for ways to invest a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said eagerly . " I 'll stay here and take care of Persia . One thing , though : when I have a really big entertainment , you must be here . " He was glad to make that concession . He was so overjoyed that he almost proposed coming home each day for dinner ; but Eilley did not seem to have it in mind , and he let it pass . " A bank , " said Sandy . " Thet would be a good thing fer us . " " Very good . I understand Mr. Sharon intends to start a bank . You 'd best look into it . "  | " I will , " he said . " If you was a banker , " Eilley went on , " men would think of you as their natural leader . The bankers are the biggest men in any city . " " Thet 's true , " he said , though he had no notion of what was true . He was thinking that tonight he would sleep in his underwear in the old cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then . " " As often as you say . " And he added humbly : " I 'll have to come and tell you what I find out  --  and the plans I make and all . " " Mr. Bowers , " she said , " you'n spend a little time finding out what is going on over there  --  who is getting rich fastest and who is most important . Well , everything you can . And , of course , you will not get drunk . " " Of course not , " he said . Sandy lost no time in fleeing from all the things that had been bearing him down . He hugged Persia to him , kissing her sad little face and her ringlets ; he said goodbye to Louisa and Betsy and Jim ; he kissed his wife ; and then with a bag which Eilley had packed for him he entered the handsome carriage and drove away . In the Gold Canyon cabin he slipped into some old garments that hung from the wall and sat on the bunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was over here , of course , to watch their mine , establish a bank , multiply their fortune , and discover what mischief the William Sharons were up to ; but during the first day and night he did not intend to leave the cabin . He would enjoy to the full his new freedom , this privilege to be himself again and cook his food in old pots and eat it out of tin dishes and gulp his coffee from a tin cup . He might go out back and build a campfire and smell , as in the days when he was only a teamster , the fumes of boiling coffee and frying bacon and sliced potatoes floating in hot grease . He might ask Luff over to eat with him . Eilley would not like that , but she need not know . A man , it seemed to him , should have a few homely little rights of his own that were none of his wife 's business . Once in a while he should run away from culture and rediscover the things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
