CURRTYNDED by her ancient province , La , holding desperately to the image of her past securities , guarding her treasure with the force of her deep inner dismay , the ancient island world of England stands facing the future . What holds her together to-day is chiefly the immense accumulated inertia of the ages in men 's thought and habit , together with the profound resources collected in a century and a half of unparalleled expansion and power . An energy unequaled in the world since Rome reached out from that small green island wreathed in its eternal mists , from ports and harbors whose smoke drifted back over the face of the fairest rural landscape the earth has known . Now in a hundred valleys and Plains , grimed with the smoke of the industrial era , the hammers of progress are done ; the hammer still sounds , but only to beat out for the ancient island the new hard shell that is not for the future but only to defend the achievement of the past . To anyone who has lived long and quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises with every flick of the fire on the old hearth , a vision that will not be denied . Through every country lane more lovely than its picture , over the wild waste of her moors , the terrifying contours of her industrial towns , stretches a thin veined hand . It is a hand from the past . The impulses of those old arteries are still very strong . Are they strong enough to hold and preserve her ? The summer of 1939 had come as gently as ever to the Sussex fields and lanes , to the old farm under the downs , and the two Americans who lived there had again watched the dispersal of the long winter dank beneath the spreading carpet of May-bloom . We could watch as ever , bemused , the slow folding of seasons , the dark grape-hue of winter mists in the folds of the hills yielding to the first pastel ; and in that tentative fading and change was a symbol of our remoteness , in England , from the imperative summons and burning zest of American skies and seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First World War , spent in many countries , we could recall how often we had come to Europe for that inner light which continuity and tranquillity of experience kindle . In Europe , and in England especially , the present was never more than one surface of the past , pushed into the foreground for immediate observation . Men are , in a way , dependent on this kind of continuity . We can not look ahead if , somehow , we can not look back . This was the meaning and import of Europe to Americans like us . We had come to Europe , to the quietest and most traditionally minded place in Europe , and we had settled in a corner of it where every field and grove and hill was sculptured in the long light of the past ? only to find this continuity passing and the light rapidly going out . Decent , thoughtful men , not only in England but all over Europe , looked out at kindly fields and villages stamped with their forefathers ' toil and saw the shadow of panic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going , and the war that was coming close , closer every day , was only a symptom of it , not a finality . The old European controls were down . In Germany the incarnate ghosts of despondency laid the whips of sadism round the necks and shoulders of a shuddering civilization . In England the controls were sinking too as an old civilization tried to preserve and isolate itself , turning its back on those great responsibilities which only a young , energetic civilization could face . When shattered nerves could no longer stand it Europe would collapse into war , almost with relief , with just that gasp and clutch of a man who has hung from a precipice with grass roots in his hand . Through all the deepening shades one picture of England was impressed on us . It was of a very old world ; not the glamorous old world of the tourist , the tradition-hungry American , but an old world losing its spirit in that slow , organic , shapeless fashion that marks all change in England to-day or yesterday . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ruled in that old world , go to some picture gallery and look at the portraits of the Venetian merchants who also knew how to grip hard and to cling . That was the expression we saw in England 's rulers : the same hard , alert caution , the same intense conservatism , the same crafty avoidance of risks , the look not of eager merchants confronting a changing world , but of trustees of a world their enterprising forefathers had built . If you look again at the picture of England to-day you will notice other things . You will see a vast , docile mass of people , accustomed to leadership , accustomed to doing what they are told ? although among them , here and there , you can find rumors of revolutionary restlessness and strains of as vigorous a character as any nation has ever bred . You will notice too how small England really is for such a mass of population . The land you sec is really a little land , territorially smaller than Sweden . Divorced from the prestige , influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more weight to bear on the general problems of mankind than just the strength of a restless , energetic , creative spirit . A long day 's drive in a good car will bring you from the south to the north of this island country ; at no point in that drive will you be more than a hundred miles from the seacoast . Look once more at this picture and you will notice other curious things that make England unlike any other land in the world to-day . What will strike you first of all is not how crowded that island is with its forty-five million people , but how empty . You may walk for miles over the Yorkshire moors or the hilly stretches of the Border without seeing a house or a sign of human habitation . If you journey by train from Plymouth to London your trip will be through one vast park , with plowed fields here and there , cattle grazing , glimpses of ancient farms and manor houses set in their perennial frames of unchanging rural loveliness . From all this land the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled agglomerates . Go farther north again along the spine of England , the Pennine range that strings along from the Lakes to the Midlands , perhaps a hundred and fifty miles . Here the real story and condition of England stretch out , one sprawling Pittsburgh crowded together on the spine of England , its smoke lying for miles like a fog over the wild peaks or the gentle grasslands on either side . From Leeds to Derby you are never away from the beat of the factory hammers , except in those desolate regions where the factories lie forlorn and broken and the forgotten men of England cling like debris to the rotten towns and villages that fringe its edge . Here , then , is the answer to the huge moors , parks , and deserted tracts , and to the beautiful Georgian manors , set in their eternal loveliness of meadow and wood . Those who move and live on the brighter surface of England ? Mayfair , Piccadilly , Rotten Row , the pink-coated huntsmen in the field , the quiet , drab gentlemen in Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe their existence to this . Eighty per cent of the population of England is clustered in towns like these , like Leeds , Manchester , Bradford , under their eternal tall pillars of grime and smoke . Twenty-five per cent of that eighty per cent cling to London and the immense drab vistas of the London suburbs alone . II Once you are anchored for a time in a certain place you identify yourself with it . The slow ways and manners , the easy , kindly ways of the Sussex country people were all on our side . They were not afraid to talk to us as they were to the Squire or the Squire 's son or the Rector 's wife or other persons above them whose elevation demanded acorresponding elevation of sentiment . Our very impermanence as foreigners gave us readier access . The lane in which our house stood led out of the village and past the entrance of the long drive to Clifton Hall , with its gatekeeper 's lodge gone green with age and moss , the massive oaks rooted in velvet turf kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes , the grim facade of the manor on your right , three crazy-roofed cottages on the left , with our own faded-red lump of a house snugly laid in a fold of the land over toward the large copse where the pheasants bred . Ahead of you rose the downs , edging and encompassing the whole estate in high , fluid lines . Here were the limits of a world complete in itself and self-sufficient . It had been one of the most prosperous agricultural properties in the south ; never a large estate , as estates go , running to about fifteen hundred acres , but with good soil . That soil , which long ago had supported a manor , a Squire with his stables and hounds , three farmers and their families , a dozen cottagers and their children , now supported a decent , hard-bargaining tenant in his suburban villa with gargoyles , his wife , his two cars , and a half dozen hardworking , aging laborers right out of the old , fading book of rural England . As the tenant had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of it , he was putting nothing back into it . The men who worked for him , cheerfully on the whole , for he was a fair master , complained that he was starving the soil , that it was getting too thin for good crops . The " Old Squire , " of revered memory among the cottagers , who had handed over the reins to his son to avoid death duties just after the last war , had retired to die in a Victorian villa on the coast . The present easygoing Squire and his son had their heads full of other things than the estate . Everything , including barns , fences , and walls and our own house ? which we were continually cementing together and patching ? was going into a state of mossy and picturesque ruin . Clifton Hall itself , the great house , had one sound wing , the Georgian one where the family lived . The rest was inhabited by bats and mice who got wet when it rained , and by slum children from London at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad a state as Clifton Hall itself . There was a great dearth of money ; taxes were too high . There was only enough cash really to keep things glued and strung together . Some of the cottages leaked , some had water on their kitchen floors all winter , some had holes through which the wind blew so hard that you could not keep a candle alight until the new housing laws came into effect and the local authorities took a hand in things ; and one and all , the houses shook in the winter gales . Sir John Clifton , the " Young Squire , " as he was called in deference to his father of respected memory , we saw only once or twice during our whole stay on the Sussex farm . He was a short , bottle-nosed , heavy-set man , supposed to be possessed of a sense of humor , and generally popular . Lady Clifton appeared only once on the horizon at a garden party at the Hall , a remarkable affair to which the whole village was invited , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , butcher with butcher , banker with banker , ironmonger with ironmonger , and so on right up to the " County " who surrounded Lady Clifton in the dominating group , an altogether weird and terrifying assortment , some of them in picture hats with feather boas right down to the ankles . Amid this group Lady Clifton stood , a rather awkward , tall , thin , frightened , elderly lady , looking as though she were not sure whether she had been invited or not . She had a reputation in the village for being mild and kind . The farmers and laborers were one and all products of an older rural way of things that was rapidly fading out . They had an air about them that theshabbiness of their clothes could never disguise , the air of free men doing the work they liked and did well . Roberts , the shepherd , a stout ball of a man with round cheeks , deep sly eyes , and a ragged mustache , was the best thatcher of hayricks in the county . Barker , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lean and tall and often a little yellowish from overwork and days in the wet fields and nights in his small , damp cottage where he lived with his wife , son , son-in-law , daughter , and two children , all in five small dark rooms . His face was drawn thin , a fine face like a noble profile on a coin . There was old Evans , the field hand , who lived in a red-tiled cottage in a hollow of the hills behind us , who had survived three attacks of winter pneumonia and still did a full day 's work , though feebly , at seventy-eight . There was John Graw , a man of lower-middle-class urban origin and of intellectual independence , whose face had been terribly smashed in the War and who had come to the Sussex farm and become a cattleman . And there was Old Grimshaw , the foreman , a tall , slow , ruddy man whose devotions were purely and entirely reserved for his master . This feudal devotion in its singular purity gave him an awkward grace that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace of an ancient and trustworthy dog . It was through Grimshaw , as time went on , and from his large , placid wife , that we were enabled to look through the mist and ruin of the present to a livelier , more flourishing background at Clifton . To Mrs. Grimshaw the " good old days " were especially vivid , for had she not played as a child forty years ago with the Old Squire 's daughters up and down the long , dark , echoing halls and corridors of Clifton ? One could see her even now , as she recalled those days stooping over the mixing bowl in her low-ceilinged cottage kitchen , with the door open on the sun and the flowers outside ? one could see in that stout , placid , elderly face the face of the child she had been ; for the memory of it burned like a candle behind thin parchment and she could remember how ashamed she had been because the Squire 's daughters wore slippers that made them seem to fly along the corridors while she had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice each summer the " ladies , " now grown gray as herself , still rode over to see her , and on these days Mrs. Grimshaw was a child again and the only pain was the memory of their slippers and her boots . These scattered visits were her lifeline , for out of them she received her sense of life ? that is of the past . All her vindictiveness and her scorn were saved for the ways of people nowadays , and these memories nerved her for a greater scorn . There were both strength and weakness in this attitude . It was the strength that we saw first ; the weakness came to trouble us only later . For that kind of solidarity with the past , which was Mrs. Grimshaw 's chief attribute , and Grimshaw 's doglike upward glance toward master as the source and sun of everything , were typical of much we saw in England . It was the loyalty between master and man , an old feudal loyalty . It was a relationship like that between a good dog and a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the same roof , in adjoining cottages , and hoed gardens separated by nothing but a low hedge for thirty years , still did not understand one another and kept their deeper communications to themselves , or if they were men , to favorite drinking chums from other parts of the farm or village at the pub . Loyalty to a class , a party , a principle was quite beyond them . What concerned them was loyalty to a man . It was hard not to respect this ; at the same time it was impossible not to ask what it might mean for the future of an aging system . The attributes of the Old Squire ? his picture hung on Grimshaw 's wall ? that fell from the old foreman 's lips were almost exactly the attributes of a great tribal deity ? an Old Testament deity , stern , strong , and terrible in his rages . These rages were directed chiefly against poachers and farmers who shot foxes , for he was a hunting deity and never off his horse during the winter . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farmer who shot a fox off his land before he ate his breakfast , " even though that farmer had lost all his poultry and half his lambs the night before . He kept all the roads of the estate like billiard tables , and one famous drive that ran through woods and copses and circled the beech grove under the downs was so solidly carpeted with moss that the sound of a horse could n't be heard . It " looked like a green carpet unrolled through the trees . " And winter and summer , so Grimshaw said , men were kept at work sweeping it so that no dead leaves or twigs gathered to spoil the surface . The Old Squire would have had apoplexy if he had lived to see how things were done now on the estate ? gates rotting and hanging of their hinges , fences collapsing , roofs falling in . But he was gone and those who remained were only ghosts of him , slack ghosts , in a world that as we looked at it here at Clifton , or farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be losing its grip . III The village , like the farm , framed a picture of many things that are true of contemporary England . It was not a typical village , or even an altogether rural one . Lying about forty miles south of London , near one of the main south-coast roads , it had the growing suburban flavor of most places within commuting distance of the city since the great building boom of the early thirties . The village was proud , in a way , of its progressiveness , which was that of a prim , pleasant , middle-class woman out on a shopping tour . Its politics , like its small trimmed lawns and yew hedges , were conservative . It prided itself on its purse and its leisure , and a certain number of its inhabitants went in for " higher things " and kept , along with a butler or a French cook , an atmosphere of the arts . This atmosphere , being purely artificial , was perhaps a little deadly with a look of wax flowers about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . A good place to watch it was in the village church on Sunday ; and a good place to see it written was on the large flabby face of the Rector who occupied the post of rural dean . A sullen , determined , obstinate look hung about most faces in church on Sunday . It was the right thing to do and they were bound to do it . It made us feel that religion in England was a purely conventional affair , like five o'clock tea , and that the Church , as a whole , was a depressed area like some of the great , sprawling valleys in the Midlands and Wales . Probably a good deal of this frigid conformity to convention resulted from the fact that so many of the better-class people in the neighborhood were retired doctors , colonels , and professional people who had lived side by side for only five or six years and were , therefore , strangers to one another . A strange awkwardness presided over most functions in the drawing-rooms of the better-class homes in our neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to grow again during dinner . It seemed as though these people who had occupied the large houses in the neighborhood for years still had nothing in common and no ideas to give conversation anything but a feeble , icy flow . An observation not utterly commonplace at one of their dinner parties fell with all the shattering effects of a ten-pound weight on a glass counter . The best people here did not think . The things that were good form ? attendance at the Glyndebourne Opera , the ballet , a kind of queasy excitement over music and the tame little comedies of the West End theater , golf , the Wimbledon tennis , the quaint peasant customs of the Tyrol , the Scottish moors were dragged out from their mental drawers and pocketbooks after coffee and given that kind of airingthat an infant in a pram gives a rattle . To say that the social life of our village was not brilliant is not enough ; it burned like an eggshell at the bottom of a coffee pot . But odd and amusing as it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ; for these were the substantial , solid people , not too highly placed or too lowly , the people who were supposed to be the backbone and sinew of England , the sort who " traveled " for amusement and culture , who left their imprint on everything including politics and government , to whom the queer mouthy editorials in the Times were addressed , who filled comfortable paunches with red sides of beef on Sunday , who occupied pews at church and came away with a look of vacant holiness , who arranged bazaars and fairs and , as far as they could or dared , ruled over the destinies of men like Grimshaw , Roberts , and Barker and told them how to cast their ballots on election days . They were not active sinners and they were not vicious ; they were simply ciphers filled with a wind that other minds had pumped into them , and not wholly alive . Individually , and outside of the sterilizing influences of their group , caught off their guard , as it were , some of them showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system that had never had the curiosity or the desire or the foresight to compare itself with any other culture or system , they were badly ingrown . The certitude of superiority with which every English child is blessed at the christening font blinded them one and all to any one of a hundred things they did not want to see , things that were changing the face of Europe and the world around them and confronting them with an ever-growing menace . IV Most Americans , when they come to England , attach themselves to some remnant of England 's past . That is what we had done . But it is an even stronger habit of English people themselves . The rather wistful reaching backward into the past that has caused the New England countryside of America to spring to life again ( not a very authentic life but still a life of sorts ) has had for years its counterpart in England ? with this difference , that America likes to step back into the rejuvenated shell of its past to bypass , avoid , or forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England one goes back because one does not know how to go ahead . Scattered about us , the old farmhouses with any pretensions to architecture and many of the old mossy cottages were being picked over by real estate agents and sold at premiums to city dwellers , and architects were doing a thriving business modernizing them without spoiling the " atmosphere . " Side by side with any vigorous solution of the architectural problems of English living , urban or otherwise , this might have been an interesting development ; independent of them , it was the simplest sort of admission , to our eyes , that the things done to the countryside in England had been done once for all , could never be better done , and that all that had been done in the industrial era was as useless as all that was being done in the present was vulgar . Contrasted with the efforts made in Denmark , Holland , Sweden , to build in the present so that future generations might not live to regret their ancestors , the English building boom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planless , sprawling muddle , an often dishonest muddle of bogus building that ruined whole miles of countryside . No one seemed to have tackled the problem of building to-day in England so that the England of to-morrow should not look much worse than the England of its pre-Victorian yesterday . And those who did care , and there were many , about the attributes of a charming countryside were content to conceal themselves behind a fa ? ade of the centuries in ancient , restored ruins , amid reminders of an age when men had built suitably and beautifully . The number of English people who were always wandering back into the past for support ? spiritual support , moral support , even common architectural support ? struck us as continually fantastic . The present , whether it was in the theater , in literature , in art , or the movies , or merely in us as representatives of the present , as Americans , made some people writhe and shudder . Their heads were full of curious ideas about England , most of them resembling the bric-a-brac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food in France , the commercial taint of Americans , the cruelty of Spaniards , their eyes forever riveted on their own fireside and the Sunday roast . The persuasion that all good things were to be found in the British Isles if only one looked far enough or scratched deep enough had its counterpart in the persuasion that , barring a few foibles ( which Dickens and Thackeray had touched on in their books ) nothing really bad was to be found there . What had n't been invented or accomplished by the British was hardly worth admitting on the score of real achievement . It was a comfortable doctrine and one which filled us continually with real discomfort . We could see some virtue in it , more especially that virtue of a perfect sense of security which an Englishman habitually derives from his familiar environment . But we could not see it without wondering what , in default of any standard of comparison , most Englishmen really know about England . In our own village among casual acquaintances if we mentioned the industrial era we were treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Refined people did not admit Leeds or Bradford and had never visited them , probably for the same reasons that refined Bostonians in the good old days could not bring themselves to admit Chicago or Detroit . To live in an Eighteenth Century place and admit the Welsh mining towns at the same time was to admit evil . You chose , if you were fortunate enough to be able to do so , the era most suitable to you and identified yourself with it . Most people in our village chose the Victorian era . It went with more limited sorts of incomes ; it also went with the things the ironmonger supplied ? lamps , oil stoves , candlesticks . It went with the high cost of electricity and the prohibitive cost of gas for cooking . Wealthier people might do fantastic things , such as denying by implication that a Victorian era had even existed , and youngsters might flout it . But the life of our village , the architecture of our village , and the men of our village were Victorian , knew they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of these people would deny an evil rather than face it . They might listen one day to political speeches reiterating the strength , unity , and vitality of England , and the next day avoid an account of the malnutrition of English children or an editorial on the decline of the colonial empire . It was better , it seemed , to believe that all the new conscript militiamen were very fit , fitter than ever , than to realize that the army had suddenly dropped its standards . Whom should one believe ? the politicians , or those uncomfortable people who said things no one liked to hear , who went out to the big cities or to Jamaica and Trinidad and made official reports the government tried to scratch over as best it could ? Neither in England nor in the Empire itself , leaving the self-governing Dominions aside , were the masses of people getting a living on anything like an adequate modern scale . Would anything be done about it ? We thought not , and those thoughtful Englishmen most deeply concerned about England 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake and eat it , nor your complacency and the troubles of empire together , and it was trouble that England was now avoiding at all costs , at all times . No statesman in power in our time in England , until the new war , had ever risen to that plane of common sense where it becomes apparent that even peace and a long life , to say nothing of health and progress , can not be bought or preserved without struggle . Was it simply the fatalism of the very old ? of those to whom death is an ever present emergency blotting out the contours of vigorous life ? Was it all a question of time , of the clock on the wall ticking away the rise , flourishing , decline of man , cattle , dog , nation , or empire ? The hand-picked men of the American democracy in diplomatic posts in England , and the hand-picked intelligences of the State Department in Washington and in the White House were seeing one sort of thing ; we were seeing another . Who was right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of well-managed and pleasant royal tours , in the vigorous determination of American diplomats " to get on " in the society to which they were accredited , a keying-up of American foreign relations to assumptions that no longer hold wholly true . If England needed support to-day , democratic support ( and it certainly seemed to us that she did ) , she needed it at just the democratic level that diplomats never reached . English character alone , what it was , what it wanted , what it really believed , presented a first-rate problem to American diplomacy . England spent immense efforts in exploring the American political hinterland and picking key men for key positions , while American millionaires were trundled out of their offices , fitted into striped trousers , told to buy a glossy hat and dispatch case , and sent to England with a social directory and a guidebook in their hands , and a State Department thesis prepared for them . What we would have liked to see was a long lean Yankee chosen for his brains , leaning over the back fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by his brains , picked himself out as an intelligent spokesman for a great mass of silent , acquiescent people on whose shoulders the roof of England would crash , if it did crash . A man taking a walk , with a knapsack on his back , stopping off at industrial towns , knocking at cottage doors , could learn much more about England in two months than if he did the proper thing in a triangle between Portland Square , Downing Street , and Buckingham Palace gate . He could learn where honest American support should be given in England ; and he could learn that this support must be based upon complete knowledge and a sense of responsibility . V What always puzzled us was the curious insistence that there was still some peculiar magic in the English air that would see old England through , even without aid from the world outside . One gathered that at a strolling gait and with the use of his left hand alone any Englishman could accomplish more than two Continentals at a run and using both hands . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be measured by the enormous prestige that it had enjoyed . The habit of mind that goes with good , loose tweeds and a fishing rod or gun under the arm could never be dissociated from the traditional background of European diplomacy . Just as in the Eighteenth Century no petty princeling of Europe was complete or happy without a miniature backyard Versailles , so in the Victorian days when France had receded and England loomed large , nothing was quite perfect that did not have an English label and reference number . Whatever ambitious dreams the statesmen of the Continent went to bed with , they woke in the night with an awful apprehension of what English diplomats were doing with their fishing rods . The whole weight of their invincible Victorian progress lay back of this ; no matter how a British statesman floundered or stumbled , the weight he carried was quite enough in itself to carry other things down with it . The idea slowly lodged itself in the mind of England that a British diplomat 's stupidities were worth twice over the cleverness of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " also stood back of this . The more plain and blunt a man was the more chance he stood in politics . Many English ministers had aimed to win the Derby , but not one had been known to fix his eyes on a Nobel prize . Englishmen in responsible places with brains or technical knowledge hid them . It was safer . Almost the worst charge that could be leveled at an English statesman was cleverness or complete capability in his own field . How deeply persistent this legend was in British politics could be seen by the treatment accorded to Winston Churchill by his own political party all through the dangerous days before the present war . Whenever he rose , as on the occasion of Munich , to predict the exact course of darkening events , he was slowly , quietly pushed down again . The profound distrust of a man who dared to think and utter what half the world already knew caused headshakings throughout the country and made the thin hand that wrote the editorials for the Times shake with official indignation . Mr. Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . But what a dreadful thing , and whoever believed in it ? Confidence , in the English understanding , did not grow out of cleverness . Better , far better , a discreet old fumbler like Chamberlain , who when he muffed the ball did it in true British fashion , of whom it could always be said that if he slid to home-base on his nose , at least it was a plain English nose . It was this habit of trusting important things to men who did not grasp them that the Nazis counted on in their rapid rise from the time of the Hitler revolution until the war . Great Nazi exploits , such as the invasions of the Rhineland and Austria , were always , at the beginning , timed to the English love of long , quiet week-ends in the country . By the time this habit had grown to be a joke in the eyes of the rest of the world English ministers in power were just beginning to grasp its implications . No one who had enjoyed , as we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain about this long lingering of an older spirit which alone and in itself made them possible . Yet in many ways this system , a relic of those greater Victorian leisures which many people today view in retrospect with nostalgia , works to its own great disadvantage . There is no way in England to-day of getting things done very quickly or efficiently . There is no way , not because the tools in many cases are not there , but because the spirit or perhaps only the time sense is lacking . What is done quickly , in the American sense efficiently , is consequently often done without the necessary bolts and rivets . The telephone system , the road and transport system , are in reality only shadows of really first-rate and up-to-date systems as American and Continental people understand them . The habit of standing level with and meeting eye to eye a competition that turns out unfavorably to them is not an English habit . It is a Continental habit . The adaptations of the French to changing conditions are innumerable ; the adaptations possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and manner of life and all its accompaniments , fixed and ordained for all time , hangs like a slow , dim fog over the island kingdom and in men 's thoughts about it . In such vital manifestations as art , industry , health , or simply preparation for emergency , the English spirit , compared to the French , seems dead , or what is worse , completely turned in on itself . Even in the field of sport the terrible pall that would follow the whacking defeats of the English players at Wimbledon seemed to us an unhealthy thing . Instead of looking deeply into the real causes of their losing sport event after sport event ? the general health and vitality of their own people impaired by generations of unhealthy living and malnutrition ? most ordinary Englishmen preferred to see some disagreeable qualities of their opponents . And where itwas an American victory there went up the old cry that the American professional attitude spoiled everything , or that other most unfortunate charge of unfair play . Never by so much as a word or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to supplant them in their own field of excellence . Not until the English trans-Atlantic plane took off , with the aid of a refuelling plane , to carry mail across the ocean in the middle of the summer of 1939 ? when two American planes had been plying back and forth with full passenger and mail loads for weeks ? was it generally conceded in our village that you might send a letter across the ocean by air . VI After a total of more than five years ' residence in England there were two phases of life there which we ccaid no longer view with that unprejudiced attitude we had tried to bring to bear in studying a country not our own . They were health and housing . It is a fact ( Ministry of Health Report , 1938 ) that the empire which owns one quarter of the earth 's surface can not feed one-half the population of England alone . Fifty per cent of the people have some form of malnutrition , first because they can not afford essential foods and second , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among those appearing on the report of undernourishment are people with an income of five thousand dollars a year . ) We set about learning the day-by-day meals of those about us , and since they were standard and seldom varied , an adequate appraisal was possible . We found that the daily diet of the employed , rural family in the time of peace and plenty that was soon to end ran thus : Breakfast ? Tea , porridge , bread ( with mar-garine ) Dinner ? Meat , potatoes , a vegetable when one was up in the garden ( this meant , except in July and August , cabbage or Brussels sprouts ) Tea ? Tea , bread , jam , sometimes cheese . One understood a good deal about English health when one realized that the children were having no milk ( except that " dash " in their tea ) , no butter , no fruit , and no green vegetables except members of the cabbage family ; and one no longer wondered about the appalling state of or lack of teeth in England . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was published in the papers a typical day 's menu in the army camps . It was : Breakfast ? Porridge , liver and bacon , tea Lunch ? Steak and kidney pudding , canned peas , new potatoes , prunes and custard Tea ? Bread and butter , cake , strawberry jam Supper ? Cornish pasties ( meat pie ) , tea . This seemed to be considered rather a dietetic masterpiece , since it included meat three times a day and butter for tea ; but we continued to feel uneasy about the preponderance of meat and dough for lads of twenty who have been underfed and misfed since birth . Nothing of course could give them back their teeth at that age or could counteract the inroads rheumatism had already made , but we thought perhaps something a little better could be devised to improve what health they possessed . Going up the income scale a bit , we found welcome additions to the working-class diet in the form of lettuce and tomatoes and a sprinkling of fruit . But we were shocked by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own experts , a third-rate or C nation physically , so far nothing effective has been done about it . It is true there was a fitness campaign in the winter of 193B-39 , but that consisted of courses of group exercises , and as Lord Harder , the famous London doctor , pertinently asked , what is the use of giving physical jerks to people who have n't enough to eat or the vitality to get through their daily work ? If England can not raise an adequate diet for forty-five million people on her home soil , there remains one-quarter of the globe which belongs to her on which todraw . There remains also the problem of either securing empire produce at prices within the reach of English wages or of fixing English wages to enable English working people to purchase empire produce . Finally , there is the no less difficult problem of teaching their own people what foods they require . Housing became inseparable from this question of England 's health . We made an inspection of one of the vast new blocks of flats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slum dwellings . After noticing approvingly the great wide windows to bring light and air to people who had lived so dankly before , the well-proportioned rooms , the modern bath and the kitchen with gadgets , it was with something of a start that we saw a small iron grate in the living room , realized that what we had thought was a boot cupboard in the hall was a coal bin , saw that the floors of kitchen , hall , and bathroom were of uncovered concrete . We could see the new flat as it would appear tenanted in November : the state of those concrete floors when the children came in from school through the mud , after the mother had filled coal scuttles from the bin and carried them to kitchen and living room . We knew what it meant when working people had to heat their own flats and their own hot water . Four people , nine dollars a week income , coal fifteen dollars a ton ? it meant they got along without heat and without hot water and they would sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows with a raw fog outside that cut damply to the marrow of their bones , and look ironically at the fine modern bath and the living-room grate and at the white gas range in the kitchen with the slot for pennies above it . We asked the proud young manager of the flats timidly about central heating and he laughingly said that all the Americans asked about that . The answer was that the tenants had never had it and did n't like it , which , non sequitur that it was , had the ring of finality . The young manager concluded generously , " Perhaps we should n't have so much rheumatism though if we heated them . " What can you do about a people who have never had heat and do n't like it , who will stand anything , who will shiver nine months of the year and stay cheerful , who will live on a diet everyone else in the world knows is unfit for human health and prefer it , who are so proud of their own shortcomings that they defeat their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggedly third-rate physical specimens in the face of a war , whether of nerves or actual combat or economics , paying not the slightest attention to the warnings of their own fine doctors and scientists , with no thought for the future , no thought for the present , and saying flatly this is the British way of doing things ? In our first summer in Sussex we went to the village chemist to ask what they did about the excessively hard water of the district . " We put up with it , " he said . We went elsewhere and bought a water softener , but then that was the American way . The habit of pulling in the belt and grinning in the face of conditions that would drive a foreigner to the desperations of revolution is a very old English habit . It is admirable , in a sense , and England is a good place for Americans who would like to learn how to face life patiently , calmly , and courageously under hardship . Yet it was an open question to us whether the blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English population might not be a mark of devitalization . Often when watching crowds , as during the Coronation ceremonies when the parks and even the great thoroughfares of London were turned into camping grounds and people lay stretched out on newspapers on the paving stones , we had to ask ourselves whether there was really the spark of anything but a great mass conformity in this vast huddle of unkempt figures andgray faces . People kept dropping down in dead faints all round us during the long procession , people who had stood for twelve hours with nibbles of chocolate for sustenance . These were abnormal conditions , but what we were witnessing was not abnormal ? the patience , the orderliness , the lack of rowdiness , the good temper of a British crowd . To Americans the virtues of honesty , decency , of live and let live , the strains of courtesy and quiet patience that run through England are good things to see and live among . But Americans should know too how many English people look on things like this , born to-day not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inertia , with a profound and answerless sadness . VII We could turn all this over in our minds on the Sussex farm . We did not want England to fail . Because upper-class England , public-school England , was tactless and impolite and insensitive with Colonials and Americans and foreigners , and sterile within itself , that was only a qualifying condition , not an absolute one . On the face of old Jarley when he rumbled into Southampton in his ancient taxi to meet us whenever we returned from America there was something beyond tact and courtesy and ignorance . It was the utter and peaceful recognition of men of good will toward good will in others . Yet we could not help puzzling over the muddle that marked English political life in our time . Why , after the stupefying blunder of Munich , which threw into the hands of the Nazi hangmen the most respectable democratic country to the east of Hitler in Europe , with the third best army in Europe and fortifications second only to the Maginot line , and falling back months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without backing by Russia ? why , after a procedure pointing like a steady signpost
