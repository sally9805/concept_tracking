Gasoline deliveries to all filling stations in 17 Atlantic States-and also in Washington and Oregon-will be cut 20% this Thursday . This time the order is no Harold Ickes false alarm . The oil companies demanded it , out of necessity , and they asked not a 20% but a 25% reduction . Filling stations may remain open not more than twelve hours a day , six days a week . This temporary restriction may soon become formal : every motorist in those States will then have to have a ration card . <P> Since Pearl Harbor , Eastern oil stocks have dropped 2,000,000 bbl. a week ; now they total only 50,000,000 bbl. - about a month 's supply in normal times . The oil shortage now , as it was last fall , is really a transportation , shortage , but this time it is acute . At the peak of last fall 's oil scare , about 20% of the 300-odd tankers that usually ply the Atlantic Seaboard were on loan to Britain . Now tanker service has been chopped 45% , partly because of submarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent sinkings but mostly because so many ships have been transferred to war routes in the Pacific . Result : tanker deliveries are less than 900,000 bbl. daily against 1,600,000 bbl. a year ago . <P> This bottleneck would require much more drastic rationing than is yet in prospect , if the railroads had not come to the rescue. * Year ago the rails hauled practically no oil to the Atlantic Seaboard and last October they hauled only 141,000 bbl. a day . Last week they hauled 435,000 bbl. daily-a new all-time record and 40% above the rosiest estimates . <P> This record was not achieved because anyone ever found the much-talked-of cache of unused tank cars . It was accomplished by gathering all the tank cars formerly used for regional distribution ( oil trucks are doing more short-haul work ) and using them more &; more efficiently . All tank-car trains now run on fast schedule from Texas to New York , from pipeline terminals in the Midwest to New England . To speed turnaround , tank cars are now spotted ( i.e. , switched to sidings ) three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week instead of five . <P> Tank-car freight runs 4 a gallon from Texas against 1 for tankers ( including war-risk insurance and war bonuses for crews ) . Oilmen figure tank cars will add $120,000,000 to their annual transportation bill , some $90,000,000 more than the recent 10 a gallon price boost will bring in . So last month oilmen tried again for a West-East pipeline , got turned down as they did last fall , because the pipeline they wanted required 500,000 tons of scarce steel plate . But they refuse to quit , still want a fat 21-inch pipeline to move 250,000 bbl. of oil daily-about 17% of normal East Coast oil demand . The transportation cost : a gallon . <P> * Two new southeastern pipelines are also helping - one from Port St. Joe , Fla. 456 miles to Chattanooga ; another from Baton Rouge , La. 1,270 miles to Greensboro , N.C.
