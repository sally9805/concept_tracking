At 10:04 one morning last week big , bluff Senator Alben Barkley rose in the caucus room of the Senate Office Building and rapped for order . Spectators filled the hall to the corners . Senator Barkley asked for absolute quiet ; the acoustics are notoriously bad . The Congressional commit tee 's investigation of Pearl Harbor had begun : in the days &; weeks to follow , history would be dragged up from the dark corners , dusted off and laid out on the committee table for the world to read . <P> Seated with Senator Barkley were four other Senators and five Representatives . Klieg lights glared on the witness chairs . Cameramen were poised for action ; there were seats for 100 reporters . <P> In the front row of spectators sat two men with a special interest in the proceedings : big , heavy , Admiral Husband E. Kimmel , in a grey business suit , and lean , bronzed Lieut . General Walter C. Short , also in grey . Their careers were al ready wrecked . Now other men would feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innuendoes . <P> " Exhibit 1 . " In the first few days , the most interesting evidence came not from the witnesses , but from a 253-page printed booklet introduced as " Exhibit 1 . " This was a complete dossier of coded Japanese messages intercepted by U.S. <P> Army and Navy Intelligence between July 1 , 1941 and Pearl Harbor Day . It showed conclusively , if further proof were needed , that official Washington was intimately aware , long before Dec. 7 , 1941 , of the warlike intentions of the Jap Government . It also showed that matters were coming to a climax in Japan by the end of November and that a deadline for war had been set . <P> On Nov. 22 , Tokyo had cabled to Ambassador Nomura and Special Ambassador Kurusu : " There are reasons beyond your ability to guess why we wanted to settle Japanese-American relations by the 25th . . . . This time we mean it , that the deadline absolutely can not be changed . After that things are automatically going to happen .. . . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicated that the attack on Pearl Harbor was conceived by Admiral Yamamoto as far back as January 1941 . The actual date for the attack ( Dec. 8 , Japanese time ) had been fixed by Nov. 7 . <P> " Miss Kimiko . " How far things had gone was illustrated by a telephone conversation on Nov. 27 between Kurusu and Kumaicho Yamamoto , head of the American section of the Jap Foreign Office . The two men used a voice code in which " Miss Umeko " referred to Secretary Hull and " Miss Kimiko " to President Roosevelt . The term " matrimonial question " meant the negotiations in Washington , and talk of childbirth meant that a crisis was at hand . All this was clear to the U.S. agents who had tapped the Japs ' wires ; the U.S. , in peace as well as war , had all the Jap signal codes . This was what the agents heard : <P> Yamamoto : How did the matrimonial question go today ? <P> Kurusu : There was n't much that was different from what Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if a child will be born ? <P> Yamamoto ( in a very definite tone ) : Yes , the birth of the child seems imminent . It seems as if it will be a strong , healthy boy . . . . Did you make any statement to the newspapers regarding your talk with Miss Kimiko today ? <P> Kurusu : No , nothing . Nothing except the mere fact that we met.
