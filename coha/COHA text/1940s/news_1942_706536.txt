Independent reclaimers r e p ea t e d 1 y have demonstrated , he said , that tires recapped . with reclaimed rubber and using only two ounces of crude rubber for cement , are good for 5,000 to 12,000 miles . " An independent can not put up a reclaiming plant today , no matter how much money he has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Simpson said . Then he called Sims .

Sims testified . The RFC , according to Sims , agreed to help finance the plant with a loan , matching dollar for dollar the amount raised by the partners . An option was taken on a building but the promoters found that the WPB had frozen all new rubber reclaiming machinery . They found some used machinery , but the WPB froze it , too . About six weeks ago , Sims said , lie and Shea came to Washington seeking a priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their plans , which had been prepared by three engineers , and laughed at them . Plant Plans Ridiculed , ' He told us our plans looked like child 's play , " Sims continued . " When we told him they had been drawn by three engineers he called in J. H. Davidson , an industrial specialist in the WPB rubber division , and Davidson tore our plans to pieces . " Then Dr. Rogers said : ' In my opinion there are only four real rubber engineers in the country , and I know three of them . Why do n't you ' conault one of them ? It will cost you $50,000 , but you will have brochure that I 'll be able to under . stand . ' " Davidson interrupted Dr. Rogers at that point and said : ' Say , boss , why do n't you let me take a two weeks ' leave of absence and draw up those plans ? I 'd do it for half that price . " Dr. Rogers said : ' Yes , or you could use Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sims said he went to see his congressman , Rep. Fritz G.
