Hans Pete Mortensen and wife Lorraine operate a brothel called the Nifty Rooms lodging house , in Grand Island , Neb. ( pop . 19,130 ) . The Mortensens considerately took two of their girls to Salt Lake City for a brief vacation . The girls relaxed , had an innocent good time , returned refreshed to their work in Grand Island . But the Government convicted the Mortensens of violating the Mann Act . <P> This week the U.S. Supreme Court ruled , in effect , that prostitutes have as much right to vacations as anybody else . It reversed the Mortensen conviction by a vote of 5-to-4 . Wrote Justice Murphy for the majority : " What Congress has outlawed by the Mann Act ... is the use of interstate commerce as a calculated means for effectuating sexual immorality . In ordinary speech , an interstate trip undertaken for an innocent vacation purpose constitutes the use of interstate commerce for that innocent purpose . "
