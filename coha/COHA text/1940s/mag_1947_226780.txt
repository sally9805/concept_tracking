What should rouse less comment than a friendly visit by a nephew to an uncle ? But last week , when Hashimite nephew Prince Abdul Illah , Regent of Iraq , went to call on Hashimite uncle King Abdullah in the dingy Trans-Jordan capital of Amman , many an Arab politician fidgeted . That the Regent 's fellow traveler was Nuri Es-Said Pasha , perennial Prime Minister of Iraq ( temporarily out of office ) , did not add to their comfort . Arabs suspected that a familiar bee was buzzing in the Iraqis ' sedarah. * With British prompting , they thought , the Hashimite family was talking of uniting its holdings in a big Hashimite kingdom-a development which would rouse no enthusiasm in rival Arab states . <P> The British Way . A Britain which was retreating in the rest of the world still held fast to oil , pipelines and bases in the Hashimite kingdoms . The three who had their heads together in Amman were thoroughly used to working the British way . There was little about the dapper , languid Abdul Illah ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cocker spaniels ) to show that he was the son of a desert king , Ali of the Hejaz , who had been pushed from his throne , in 1925 by Arabia 's flowerless , buttonless Ibn Saud . <P> His adviser , 59-year-old Nuri Pasha , who fought for the British in World War I , is one of the few Arab statesmen who will publicly say what many secretly think-that until the world has settled down a bit , Arabs had better rely on British support . Last week Nuri said it again : " If the United Nations proves unable to provide security , we shall have to find other means to guarantee our safety . " Everyone knew that by " other means " he meant a continued alliance with the British . Nuri added that there would probably be no early revision of the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi treaty . <P> That treaty insured British paramountcy in Iraq . It gave Britain : 1 ) the right to maintain two important bases ; 2 ) management of the Iraqi State Railways and the oil port of Basra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts needed by the Iraqi Government . <P> A Shining Deed ? Presiding serenely over the British machine is tall ( 6 ft. ) , urbane , 45-year-old Stewart Perowne , able adviser in Britain 's Bagdad Embassy . Twenty years a Middle East hand , Perowne even more than the British Ambassadors ( who come &; go ) symbolizes British rule in Iraq . Unlike most British officials , he openly plugs for a larger Hashimite kingdom . A favorite Perowne remark : " Iraq shines like a good deed in a naughty world . " <P> Most Iraqis doubted whether Iraq ( or Perownia , as their country is sometimes called ) shone any brighter after 30 years of British control . The wretched fellahin are as wretched as ever , the elite of landowners and sheiks as firmly entrenched , and Iraq 's economy as firmly tied to Britain 's . The literacy rate is still somewhere between 5 and 10% ; public health service is almost nonexistent.
