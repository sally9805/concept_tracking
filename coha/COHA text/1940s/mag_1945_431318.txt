 | Irish Literature Today Now that Yeats is dead six years and AE nine , we can perhaps turn to Irish literature for an appraisal of its post-Revolutionary phase . Those two men , already grown to fame before the Revolution , so dominated the scene after it that all the younger men were obscured by them , and new work which was full of ability was made to seem trivial and immature in comparison with theirs . One can not say they led the new generation ; the difference of intent between their poetic fantasy and the younger men 's prose realism was too wide for that ; they did , by their presence , by their founders ' authority , hinder the rise of new leaders . Yeats and IE were the grand old men of Irish literature : its pioneers , as no one else is likely ever to be . As they had had no serious competitors when young , so when old they had the preponderance of fame and experience on their side . An O'Flaherty or an O'Faolain might gain much by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the naked freedom they had enjoyed . There can be many generations of explorers and many of settlers : there is only one of pioneers ; and Irish literature is now a settled region . It is time to see how the settlers are making out . The latest reports are bad . Indeed it has been a long while since there has been a cheerful one . Sean O'Faolain , the most important Irish author living in Ireland , ended one of his editorials in the Bell with these words : " The picture is tragic , but we must paint what we see . Yeats , Moore , Joyce , Shan Bullock , MacKenna , Gregory , AE , Higgins have all gone . No young men are appearing . If our leaders of opinion do not act quickly Irish literature will virtually cease to exist within ten years . " And Frank O'Connor , writing in Horizon on " The Future of Irish Literature , " confessed that @# @# he was unable to see any future for it . " Theoretically , of course , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his books are banned , where there are no magazines to print his work , where all power is in the hands of a fanatical and corrupt middleclass , and never , never emerge from his ivory tower . But like Whitman when he saw the oak tree growing alone , I know I could not *do it . ' " Such pessimism coming from these two men can not be shrugged off , O'Faolain is one of the few Irish writers who have deliberately chosen to stay and fight it out in Ireland , though he might have found likelier rewards in almost any other direction . O'Connor has fought hard against much pressure to keep a secure foothold in Irish life . They have then the right to speak . They have won it many times over . If Irish literature can be said to have leaders , they and the poet Austin Clarke are its leaders . Of course the objection can immediately be raised that there are other and more famous living Irish authors than these . There are , but not in Ireland . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish writers who have died in the last fifteen years . He might have added another list as impressive : the names of the writers who have left Ireland , apparently for good . We should then have Liam O'Flaherty , Sean O'Casey , James Stephens , Oliver St. John Gogarty , Padraic Colum , Denis Johnston , and , if you wish , Francis Stuart , who chose Berlin . Even of the first list , Joyce , MacKenna , and AE died in voluntary exile . And Moore 's connection with Irish literature was too brief and indeterminate to establish him securely as an Irish author ; he belongs rather with Shaw and Wilde , Irish literary adventurers in England . When we are discussing the literature of a country not ravaged by war , we must look first to the books written within the country . The international writers do not yet reproduce themselves . The first difficulty the student of current Irish  | literature encounters is lack of evidence . It is hard to make sound generalizations on scanty facts , and in a literature where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very hard to name general tendencies , except the obvious tendency toward extinction . There is no longer a main stream of Irish literature . There are drops of it . As far as I can see , the output of good literary writing in the last three years , aside from the poems and stories appearing in the Bell and the Dublin Magazine , consisted of four volumes of biography , three of autobiography , two novels , two books of short stories , a few plays , a few slim books of verse , and a traveler 's sketchbook . Not much for three years ; and actually the distribution dwindles sharply toward the present . There need be no complaint of the quality of this writing . It was generally good ? and in several cases excellent , as in O'Faolain 's Great O'Neill and O'Casey 's Pictures in the Hallway . But a certain indefinable minimum of quantity is required to create or preserve a literature . In the best days Irish literature ever saw , it was not far above that minimum . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year are not enough , especially when the incidence of biography and reminiscence is so high . 2 THAT incidence , however , is not simply , as one might guess , a symptom of waning energies and fading purpose . Rather it indicates the recognition of a new set of problems to which Irish artists must face up if their work is to keep its substance . And that substance is not so easy to come by as before . Certainly one of the reasons for the quick general success of the Celtic Revival was the richness of its resources . In the latter half of the nineteenth century , folklorists , Gaelic scholars and translators , had uncovered a rich mine of prefashioned material for literature : the Gaelic legends and cycles , the colorful half-mythical history of ancient Ireland , an abundance of poetry , and the peasant myths and folk tales that served as a living bridge to that remote world . All this the Revival exploited until artists and audiences alike were surfeited with fairyland . Then came the Revolution with its own compelling romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution broke down into civil war in 1922 and 1923 , rage and disappointment created new passion that burst into words in O'Flaherty 's novels and O'Casey 's plays ; and post-Revolutionary disillusionment in Ireland found @# ready understanding in the disillusioned post-war world . Thus for forty years the Irish artist very seldom had to think of what to write about . He had only to reach out and take all he could use from the common stock . Today the situation is different . He writes of a diminished reality . His Ireland is a little country in the butter and beef business . And if he is to make his material interesting , he must study it and think about it a great deal and then sustain his interpretation of it with a durable style . It is no wonder that the number of Irish artists has fallen off so sharply , or that so many of those left are historians . Pioneers are hell on resources . That is one reason for their concern with history , but not the only one . In so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a public with a decided taste for the romantic and the Celtic , however spurious . Twenty years ago Donn Byrne readily outsold O'Flaherty and O'Casey . Nowadays the only Irish author whom publishers would consider a success is Maurice Walsh , who spreads on his Celtic romance ? impartially Scotch or Irish , ancient or modern ? with a shovel . O'Faolain , on the other hand , maintains a moderate prosperity only by working tirelessly as editor , reviewer , critic , and literary news-gatherer , at the same time that he is turning out his important novels and biographies . The others we would link with him are not welloff . They are not , then , realists and students of history for profit . Their motives are artistic ; their resolution , moral . They are trying to give Ireland a literature wholly expressive of itself as it is today , in the belief that good health begins with candid self-recognition . And because most of them can not see in standard romanticized Irish history any living roots of the country they know , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small familiar democracy . What they have found is , for most , not a long history . It begins in the dark chaos of the eighteenth century and traces , for a century and a half , the rise of the people toward a share in what the world presently offers of political and economic freedom . If they look farther back than that , they see only the crumbling facade of the Gaelic order and the dispersal of the Gaelic nobles . Then , or before that collapse , there is no sign of the Irish people . Gaeldom was an order for aristocrats . The Gaelic bards would never sully their verse with a mention of the plebeians . Bardic literature has no fabliaux , no Langland , no Chaucer , nothing for the popular taste . And since about all that the average Irishman can know of his average ancestors under Gaeldom is that he must have had them , the  | democratically-minded realists can not work up a very passionate interest in their hypothetical doings . Rather they are convinced that their true creators are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them revolution as a weapon and modernity for a prize . For the rest the story is explicitly human , and humanly simple and involved . Nothing in it is of much importance unless it happens to many people . The victories are neither sudden nor often romantic ? land acts , county council bills , extensions of franchise , increasing prosperity , and finally political independence . The tragedies are collective ? the Potato Famine , the evictions , the loss or defection of leaders setting the movement back by a decade , the drain of emigration , civil war . Even such a tragedy as Parnell 's is the act and despair of the whole people , for he was downed by a momentum he could lead but not retard , and the mob that passed over his body wept bitterly for him . 3 This is history conceived within a range that would have seemed meaninglessly narrow to the previous generation of writers . It lacks the supernatural . Its great dimension is width , the limit of its height is human stature , its heroes are inescapably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragmentariness , saying that now we know the world " through abstractions , statistics , time tables , through images that refuse to compose themselves into a clear design . " " A nation , " he said , " should be like an audience in some great theatre . . . watching the sacred drama of its own history ; every spectator finding self and neighbour there , finding all the world there as we find the sun in the bright spot under the burning glass . " But the truth is that the clear design has not yet been composed . The drama is not complete , has indeed hardly reached a climax . For to win land and freedom does not mean to win all that goes with land and freedom . This march of a people was too swift to be elaborate . They had to concentrate on getting the big things first : the fundamentals of economic , political , and cultural freedom . Till after the Revolution they had little time for the details . When they were not fighting actively for something , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidating what had been gained last . Only recently have they won that peace and stability in which the subtler manifestations of a culture can grow . Until Irish society is complete , the drabness of life in a restricted , semi-rural country without large ambitions is the inescapable obser-@# vation from which Irish realism must begin . Meanwhile , one should remember that whatever fuller synthesis will come in the future will depend no little bit on the ability and integrity of the Irish artists . In this interim of history , however , all his laudable integrity eases the Irish realist 's path not at all . It was easy to reveal the Irish to themselves as saints , warriors , and the sons of kings , as the Young Irelanders did ; or as godlike poets and dreamers , as the Celtic Revival writers did ? and make them like it . It is not so easy to draw them as rebellious peasants , brave but muddleheaded conspirators , and small-town burgesses ? and make them like that , too . Then when one cites the justifying facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the picture . Still , the greater difficulty is for the realist to satisfy himself . He is an Irishman and an artist , and needs richness and color , passion and release , as much as any romantic who ever lived . To be barred from them by his own determination to " see the facts and understand the picture " is no comfort . The self-censorship hurts as much as the official one . And in faithfully drawing a paltry truth one often gets , with much effort , a paltry result . It is not the mere crabbedness of his material that hurts ? in other countries realists have successfully conquered worse : it is its narrowness and poverty , uncomplemented by any opposing wealth . Yeats and Synge could go out among the cottages or wander on the roads to learn what the people had to say , and then return to Coole Park , Lady Gregory 's manor house , to write . The present generation has no Coole Park . The big houses went in the Revolution , aristocratic Anglo-Irish drowned out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet risen to replace them . " That , " says O'Faolain , " is our loss . . . . It means that for many Irish writers life exists on a small number of planes and their stories are lighted only from a few angles . . . . Regionalism is all very well when , as with Hardy or the Russians , it does not delimit one by a narrow circumference of values . When it does , it is in grave danger of making one 's work pure parish-pump . " For " it is . . . the consciousness of the existence of many modes of life , and some intimacy with them , that heightens the treatment of any one mode of life , gives the sense of echo , reverberations wider than the scene displayed , as well as more color and more variety in a writer 's work taken as a whole . " It is not only the lack of an O'Tolstoy that stands in the way of an Irish War and Peace . Yet these inherent difficulties , however severe ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " only the greatest obstacle that can be contemplated without despair , rouses the will to full intensity . " The realist 's self-discipline , the poverty of his material , are tests of his courage and imagination . If he meets them successfully , his work will be the better for it , hardened and refined by stiffer opposition than any critic can raise . 4 THE external difficulties , best represented by the literary censorship , have no such positive use . They are negative obstacles put up between the artist and his audience , not between the artist and his work , and for the present can be passed only if he subordinates his judgment to a pettifogging morality he despises . The censorship has had no effect on the character of Irish literature . Every Irish author of any standing is represented on the list of banned books ; none has tried to placate the censors . If the censorship were lifted tomorrow , the only immediate results would be that much energy now wasted in fighting its stupidity could be applied to better purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read what has been written particularly for them . Perhaps , too , the artist would be cheered by knowing that he was no longer regarded officially as a dangerous underworld type , to be spied on and harried for the public safety . For it is plain by now that the censor 's hand falls most heavily , not on the purveyor of obscenity , but on the non-conforming writer . He is indeed outlawed . The action against his book is taken in secret . He has no appeal from the decision of the Board . He can not expect the justice of a speedy trial , for his book may be banned as soon as it appears , or not till after the important first three or four months . Often books have been on the market eight or ten years before they excited the censors ' horror . ( A recent example is that of E. L. Voynich 's The Gadfly , which got the axe after it had passed its fiftieth birthday . ) But most maddening of all is his knowledge that the very law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the censors themselves . They have accepted the authority it bestows . They have consistently ignored its reservations . Thus it is not at all surprising that the Irish writers demand , as an alternative to the removal of the censorship , the strict enforcement of the Censorship of Publications Act of 1928 . This was proposed , as one may discover from the Irish Parliamentary Debates for 1928-1929 , with @# many assurances of its limited nature . All the safeguards , the checks and balances , contained in it were harped on by its advocates . They pointed out that a book could be banned only if it was " in its general tendency indecent or obscene , " or if it advocated unnatural methods of birth control , and that in any case the censors would be required to take into consideration the " literary or artistic merit of the work taken as a whole . " Since the Act went into effect , about 1500 books have been proscribed , including just about every Irish novel worth reading . This rather wholesale activity of the Board ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the censors most likely consider some others they do not ban ? has given rise to two popular beliefs . First , that the censors have taken to reading only the marked passages in the books sent to them , thus slighting the last-named safeguard . And second , that , as sometimes happens with men of conscious virtue when vested with public power , they have assumed a certain broad franchise over what they consider a too narrow law . That this second belief has some foundation a couple of quotations from a Senate debate on censorship , in the fall of 1942 , may indicate . In the midst of a tortuous speech , Professor Magennis , the chairman of the Board , suddenly became quite frank . The book in question , he said , was not condemned as indecent . . . . It was banned for indecency within the meaning of the Act ? a very important difference .. .. As I was saying , if we disapprove of the sale and distribution of a book the mode in which we convey that disapproval to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale and distribution of that book is to report : " In its general tendency indecent . " A technicality ! This is a revelation that must give great comfort to many an injured author . Privately , he can now understand , the censors consider him only a technical , not an actual , pornographer . But the Minister for Justice was not so soft as Professor Magennis . Bluff and hearty , he stood to his guns . Asked by a Senator what the law of the state had to say about the safe period with regard to birth control , the Minister replied : ? I am not prepared to go into the Law of the State , but I repeat that I take full responsibility for the banning of this book . Whether the Board was technically and legally correct , whether the book in its general tendency was indecent and obscene , may be open to question , but on the ground that it was calculated to do untold harm I was perfectly satisfied it should be banned . Such self-assured , self-righteous extralegality on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministration of a law is certainly absurd . One might laugh at it as one laughs at some of the Board 's more overt blunders : the banning of Shaw 's Black Girl in Her Search for God , not for its controversial text ? that would be illiberal ? but for its illustrations ; the banning of Kate O'Brien 's Land of Spices for one brief mention of possible homosexuality in one of the minor characters , though the book , a story of a young girl 's discovery of her religious vocation and of her later life in a convent , had been warmly reviewed in every English and American Catholic paper ; the banning of Laws of Life , a manual of sex instruction for Catholics , which was found , too late , to have received the permissu superiorum of the Westminster Diocesan Council . But in the end the results are not funny . An author 's reputation and property are attacked without his being allowed any legal defense . He is smothered by a " gentlemen 's agreement " to which neither he nor his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subverted to the level of personal prejudice , with effects that are to be noted in the rampant activity of every smut-hound and selfappointed censor in Ireland . The pharisaical motive behind it all is obvious ? the more rigorous suppression of criticism than of vice . The artist 's protest against the whole stupid business has best been registered by O'Faolain : ? We believe that any unnecessary interference with the public will is not merely a tyranny but a folly . It removes responsibility from the hands of the community before the community has had any adequate opportunity to exercise its own quiet methods of control . It thereby pre-empts the activity of a healthy public opinion , and prevents that public opinion from ( so to speak ) growing by exercise . It kills the national conscience by giving it no scope to take or leave , to praise or condemn , to exercise its will or exercise its wisdom . By depriving morality of its freedom it reduces it to a machine without virtue . O'Faolain should know . For his fifteen years ' activity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the censors ' accolade more than once , while his efforts have never been sustained by any corresponding measure of public support . He can have no pretty illusions about his relation to the community . In Ireland the artist and independent thinker must stand alone , comforted by no popular sympathy and understanding , drawing steadily on his own unincremented morale . He can not appeal to the Irish ruling class , the pious Nationalists the Revolution put into power , for even before the Revolution Padraic Pearse recognized and described their peculiar bigotry ? " they challenge a great tyranny , but they erect their little tyrannies . Thou shalt not ' is half the law of Ire- land , and the other half is Thou must . ' " As for an appeal to the people , any Irish author knows too well that if the Irish people cared a damn about the censorship , it would stop . 5 YET for all these obstructions which Irish artists must consider ? and perhaps the worst is this public apathy and distrust ? the quality of actual performance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the smaller forms : the short story and realistic comedy , and in poetry , the lyric and semi-ballad . There is no grandly successful Irish novel . Since O'Casey 's withdrawal the drama has been healthy and humorous ? it is still uncensored ? but pedestrian , with the two notable exceptions of Denis Johnston 's The Moon in the Yellow River and Paul Vincent Carroll 's Shadow and Substance . The death of F. R. Higgins , following so closely the death of Yeats , suddenly revealed the scarcity of poets in a country where poets had been as plentiful as journalists are elsewhere . And those who are left do not coalesce into a school . Their poems appear individually , with little reference to each other ; and the absence of interplay and mutual criticism threatens a return of that provincial idiosyncrasy that plagued Irish poetry before Yeats taught it collaboration . Yet the bigger victories have not been lost by default . The three best recent Irish novels all attempt the composition of some such clear design as Yeats demanded , some bright focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design is simply not there to be revealed . History seems to have delayed giving a verdict on which the artist can comment . Take , for example , the most forceful of these novels , O'Flaherty 's Famine . When it appeared , O'Faolain called it " Biblical . " " It is , " he wrote , " the Irish Exodus ' in which there is no Moses to lead out the people of Israel , the starving Irish millions of the black forties to whom a moonstruck O'Connell was no help . It is characteristic of O'Flaherty that in Famine he lifts his theme out of the rut of despair by combining two of his best qualities ? his power of describing natural phenomena , and his love for a big central figure to typify the things he hates or ( as in this book ) admires . " But does O'Flaherty succeed in lifting his theme out of the rut of despair ? For an Irish reader perhaps , yes . He unconsciously adds the historical sequel and understands all that O'Flaherty intends to signify with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his central characters to America . The non-Irish reader does not have that outlet . Or even if he does know enough Irish history to add the historical sequel , his emotions are not engaged by what is not in the book . O'Flaherty put all his vigor into the writing of Famine , uniting for the first time the furious speed and brutality of his other novels and the loving sensitivity of his short stories , but he is so moved by the suffering of his own people that he too often lets a brief indication support what an explanation should carry . One feels that he wrote this book as an Irishman reads it , who grinds his teeth and curses and sweats and swears his way through it , supplying out of his own partisanship the conflict that hunger drowned out in the victims . Other readers can not do that . To them this is not the Famine , but a famine . And they are oppressed and finally bored by the huge impersonality of the disaster . For O'Flaherty has succeeded almost too well in conveying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then as the terror of impact when the blight rots the potato stalks in the fields , and finally when the blight comes again in the second year and the people can only stand by dumbly and watch their food turn into a stinking pulp . To survive for the first year they have used up all their possible resources . Now , whether they stand together or alone , they can do nothing but wait for death or for an unfriendly government to save them . That O'Flaherty 's big central figure , Mary , does escape the holocaust , ? and with her , her husband and baby , ? and that they escape through the aid of an embryonic revolutionary group , no longer has the forceful significance the author intended . The courage and stubborn hope and endurance with which O'Flaherty endowed her diminish to merely individual importance against that endless background of death . And the other characters , all powerfully drawn , share the diminution proportionately . We begin to see what Yeats meant when he said that " passive suffering is not a theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , frantically alive later , at last become quiet and inarticulate as death comes near around them . In that dumbness the book ends . Even Mary and Martin escaping in the boat to America can not talk of what they have left behind them . Their youth , their way of life , their people , are dead behind them . In the few determined conspiring men without names who rescued them is the seed of the future : long relentless revolution against English control . But that seed is still hidden . Unless one knows the story of its growth , there is no purgation for the pity and terror O'Flaherty has so brilliantly aroused . He has added a great deal to national art . He has failed of universality . The tragedy is universal . But escape to America , though historically authentic , is so singular as to seem the irrelevant work of a dens ex machina . For its own purposes , art must refine history to a clearer metal , as it refines everything else it uses . 6 THE other two novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Connor 's Dutch Interior ? fail of greatness less grandly . For one thing , they have no such tremendous theme . For a second , neither history nor their own experience gives the authors an answer to the problem they attack ? " the problem of finding within the simplicity of the Irish world a way of life that does justice to the whole man . " O'Flaherty suffered as he wrote of the " great hunger , " but he suffered as a spectator . The evils O'Connor and O'Faolain describe are daily irritations : pious hypocrisy in the middle class , apathy among the people , puritanism in the Catholic clergy , nationalism gone sour from too long standing , and the stingy , shoddy willingness to get everything as cheap as the most cockeyed practicality will allow . In the environment they picture , isolation is the primary fact of life for every sensitive , open-spirited man . The politicians and puritans would isolate the whole country from the contagion of the venal , unIrish world . The man finds himself alone in a little world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is plenty of talk ? but talk on terms : to be serious is to put yourself in danger of something 's being " got on " you . So you are witty . One ca n't pin down wit . It is a grand defense . And behind the defense , or in front of it , loneliness grows by disappointment after disappointment until self-corrosion begins to tarnish each fresh personality . That provincial environment is anemically poor in developed personalities . It is rich in the number and variety of its " characters . " And , says Peter Devane , the secondary figure in Dutch Interior , " character is personality gone to seed . . . when ' t is all shaped and limited by circumstances and there is n't a kick left in it ... That 's what I am , mister ? a character ! " Yet for these men , too , there is the deus ex machina ? the boat to America . And Frankie Hannafey , O'Faolain 's rebel hero , and Gus Devane , Peter 's much loved younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nourishment and the promise of all that necessary richness Ireland does not afford . But America is not the answer now any 76 THE ATLANT  | more than it ever was . The Irishman must manage to survive in Ireland ; all the wealth of the world will not make the transplanted man a whole man ; he must grow from his own roots in his own country . So Gus and Frankie return , hungry for Ireland and its sweet peculiar flavor that outlasts the taste of disappointment and betrayal . If only then the homecoming were met with an understanding as generous as the love that inspired it , there would be a resolution of the discord , for all that it would be on a minor key . But they return looking for the lovely Ireland time has distilled from memory and are overwhelmed on the spot by all the old frustration , all the cynical indifference from which they fled . Gus fights it for a while , hoping and half believing that his own enthusiasm will somehow break down the defenses and release the lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final smashing betrayal that sends him flying again . Frankie stays ? but for what ? He fled as a hardened hungry rebel , a weapon of a man , whetted to a narrow blade by years on his keeping . In America , safe from the tension of the hunt , he drops his defenses bit by bit , tastes with a distrustful tongue the gentler pleasures , ? poetry , music , the theater , unconstrained talk , ? and suddenly realizing the fact of his dependent humanity , lets go every restraint and wallows innocently in his soul 's food . But there is tawdriness as well as innocence in that abandon . The Kingdom of Heaven does not belong to big babies . And when he advances , half against his will , to the arms of his brother 's wife , freedom turns to cheapness ? a particular kind of cheapness Irish poverty still does not allow . The fault , to be sure , is as much Ireland 's as his own . One can not learn sure , self-reliant manhood in a country whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mary . But the damage is done . When he , too , returns to Ireland it is as neither rebel nor enthusiast , but only as a ruefully good-natured man who has no confidence of the right direction for himself or his country , a man who has discovered his humanity but lost his purpose . One more of too many . 7 THERE is a great deal more to both books than I have accounted for : much insight , much humane knowledge , and in most of O'Faolain 's novel and all of O'Connor 's , very adequate , beautiful writing . But their failure and the reasons for it are obvious enough . Dutch Interior is even more of a closed cir-@# cuit than Famine ; and like Famine it closes upon death by starvation , none the less bitter because it afflicts the heart instead of the belly .

" with a despairing " Well , what the hell ? " But , if he does , his despair is not the despair of inanition . If these men have not solved the problem , they have given a full courageous statement of it . It should be understood to their credit that they have elected to fight where they stand , refusing the two routes of escape taken by most ? emigration or a return to the fairyland of the past . Like the man in O'Connor 's story " Uprooted , " they know that neither man nor nation can live on pap , no matter who proffers it . To go back to the cradle is to lie there a changeling . ... he went into the kitchen . His mother , the coloured shawl about her head , was blowing the fire .

It seemed as if only now , for the first time , was he leaving home , for the first time and forever , saying good-bye to it all . It may be that what O'Faolain fears , will happen .
