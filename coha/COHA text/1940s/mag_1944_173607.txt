To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes and distributes its news . <P> Now that everyone is wondering about Nazi morale and how it is standing up under month after month of bombings and defeats , many of our readers have been asking where we get the news from inside Germany that you find in almost every issue of TIME . <P> The answer is " mostly from Stockholm " - for Sweden is so close to the heart of Hitler 's Europe that , when the wind is from the south , people there can sometimes smell the smoke of burning Berlin . And always there are hundreds of travelers and fugitives who have just seen with their own eyes and heard with their own ears what is going on across the Baltic . <P> So TIME has posted one of its most experienced foreign correspondents in Stockholm : John Scott , who knows first-Scorr hand every country of occupied Europe except Norway and Greece-speaks Russian as well as he speaks English , knows German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not always grammatical ) in Swedish . <P> You may remember Scott as the TIME editor who lived ten years under Stalin 's rule , worked first as a welder in Siberian Magnitogorsk , later as Moscow correspondent ' for the London News Chronicle and the New York Times . <P> Sweden is as near to Germany as New York is to Boston-or Chicago to Detroit-so it is small wonder that there are so many people in Stockholm with firsthand news from the Reich . <P> " In fact , " Scott writes , " the biggest problem ' is to find out whom you can believe . Many people here have intimate and reliable contacts inside the German blockade and can provide direct , fresh information . But Stockholm is also rife with rumors and rumormongers who come to me with fantastic stories of intrigues and escapes-advice , warnings and obscure mutterings of all kinds . <P> " Characters of every description-code experts , secret agents , odd icy blondes , crumbs of European aristocracy " keep coming in to see him all the time-partly because our just-launched Scandinavian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Scott 's latest book ( Duel for Europe ) has become a Swedish bestseller . <P> The newspapers of all Europe pour into Sweden within a few days after publication-so another of Scott 's jobs is to follow what the people of each nation are themselves being told about how the war is going . He reads papers in German , Russian and Swedish himself-has a multilingual secretary read those in Finnish , Danish and Norwegian , telling him the high spots and translating the full text of the most important items . And very soon he plans a trip to distracted Finland to see for himself what is happening to that unhappy land . <P> To open TIME 'S Stockholm office , Scott crossed the Atlantic on a little unescorted merchant ship and flew to Sweden in the bombbay of a disarmed British Mosquito bomber that can carry only one passenger and flies only on moonless nights to lessen the chances of being shot down . His listening post is one of two we have set up in neutral European countries to get the truth out of Festung Euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Switzerland - and very soon I hope to be able to bring you word of still a third TIME office right under Hitler 's nose .
