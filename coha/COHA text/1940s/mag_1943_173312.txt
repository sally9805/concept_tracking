In the mornings , onetime Boxer Sydney Robey Leibbrandt punched his shadow about his cell . In the afternoons , he ranted Nazi cant . At night , he ignored his comfortable prison bed for a wooden bench . Three days of each month , he fasted . <P> Brought to trial for treason in South Africa ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) , Sydney Leibbrandt turned out to be a German agent , who arrived in a U-boat to organize sabotage and rebellion against Field Marshal Smuts 's Government . Last week in Pretoria , at the end of the Union 's longest treason trial , the judge asked sneer-faced Sydney if he wished to say anything . Up whipped Sydney 's arm in a Nazi salute . Out whipped the words , in harsh Afrikaans : " Long live Adolf Hitler , long live National Socialist South Africa . I expected to die if I came back and I 'm not afraid to do so , To hell with your mercy . " <P> Sentence : death .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
