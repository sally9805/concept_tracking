One day last month , at a Bavarian political convention , a long-nosed German politician delivered a scathing attack on the occupation authorities of the western zones . He ridiculed Allied imports as " chicken feed , " accused the British of " pilfering , " and urged sitdown strikes . Last week , Dr. Johannes Semmler got his comeuppance from the U.S. and British occupation commanders . He was summarily dismissed from his post as executive director of economics for Bizonia . <P> What Semmler had said was not highly important , since most of it was untrue or half true . What was more important was the responsive chord his tune had struck with Germans , eager to vent the blame for their troubles on the occupation . <P> In Munich , a workman told an American correspondent : " You fired him because he is the first German leader with the guts to tell the truth . " Then the workman admitted that he had only the vaguest notion of what Semmler had said . A leader of the powerful Christian Social Union party sermonized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and democracy is false . "
