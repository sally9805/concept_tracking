txt Faults in Profits Tax Bill Measure as It Stands Regarded as Blow to Investor Protection To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The vital and legitimate interests of millions of our investors , make indispensable a thorough and non-political revision of the pending so-called Excess Profits Tax Bill . It represents a combination of fundamental irrationality with crucial damage to the indisputable rights of the small shareholder . * Glaringly indicative of the bill 's basic unfairness is the pronouncement of Representative Cooper that the recapture of profits of all categories of companies is intended as an offset to the " handout " which is being concurrently given to " industry " through the grant of amortization privileges to armament manufacturers ' and through suspension of the Vinson-Trammell act . In other words , the millions of owners of general businesses are told that they must suffer because the real beneficiaries of defense activity are to be favored . Even if the relevance of a generally applied tax to windfall war prosperity could be substantiated , surely the 4.1 per cent additional levy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base-years ' average earnings form of calculation has no connection whatever with excess profits . Of the greatest importance , however , is the far-reaching extent of the revolutionary alteration which an arbitrary ceiling on distributable earnings would inflict on the fundamental status of the run of shareholders . Under existing conditions the equity holder 's only chance of surviving the many and varied potential sources of investment deterioration has been through gaining counterbalancing profits arising from a stake in enterprises which may have successfully grown , or from a cyclical expansion in general business activity . Hence the contemplated semi-confiscation of such above-average benefits , if and when they occur , overwhelmingly balances the odds against the individual shareholder 's chances for the semblance of a fair long-term return . Takation following such technique , if it is enacted and remains on the statute book , will debase the equity share tosthe status of a secularly shrinking asset and transform attempted legitimate common stock investment into futile **25;190;TOOLONG speculation . It thus will even seriously vitiate the investor protection which has been constructively provided by the New Deal financial reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aug. 30 , 1940 . Job Insurance Chiseling Small Business Reports Inability to Get Workers Except by Subterfuge To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : One concrete case of chiseling Is worth more than many rumors . Here is one such- case as written to me by a small employer , a woman whom I know and trust . I have shortened her letter somewhat , but have neither changed nor omitted anything which would alter the picture . For reasons apparent from the letter , this employer is afraid even to disclose her name , far less to help the State of New York to punish thefts against it . She writes : " I have a small designing and manufacturing business . For the last five years I have hired the same five girls ; others I take on in my rush season . This year we stopped production about June 25 . " Desiring to start work again on Sept. 3 with the same girls , I ordered many raw materials ; but I find that these girls absolutely refuse to start work until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week from the State of New York unemployment insurance . " Looking further into the matter , I find that this can be overcome provided I take the girls back but do not report their social security or unemployment insurance . Thus I could be paying a girl $40 a week and not report her to the government , the government paying her $15 a wok for staying at home . She would then be making $55 a week . " Being a woman and associated with this ' type of people , I am afraid to report this to the authorities , because if any action was taken following this information I might be a target for sabotage by one of their ' unemployed ' husbands . " The substance of this is that three workers , knowing that they can collect $15 a week unemployment insurance for thirteen continuous weeks , will not return to work until the thirteen weeks are past , unless a subterfuge is used , as explained above . These same girls make no endeavor to look for work , being perfectly willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest wage I pay a regular girl is $18 ; the highest is $40 . " One wonders how many more cases of that sort exist and go unpunished . IRA JEWELL WILLIAMS Jr . Philadelphia , Aug. 29 , 1940 . Alien Registry Law Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIDIES : The regulations for the registration of aliens allow registration at any postoffice . Thus an alien living in this town may register in New York if he wishes and use any name he happens to think of , so that his identity is more difficult to establish than before the law was passed . The law should be amended immediately to force registration at place of residence . PETER VREDENBURGH . Beachwood , N. J .. Aug. 30 , 1940 . Move for Peace Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : While the expenditure of a great deal of time , money and energy to get the , country prepared for any eventuality seems necessary , there seems to be too little stress on the possibility of a peaceful solution of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , the only great power not yet at war , to use every means of effecting peaceful settlement between the belligerents . Not only is such action the humane procedure , but it is bound to be less costly in lives and money . The time to initiate peace proposals is the present ; when both sides seem to be deadlocked , rather than wait until one or the other is exhausted , as history bears witness to the fact that no equitable settlement of strife can be based on terms laid down by a conqueror . JOHN F. LANDGRAF . Queens , N. Y. , Aug. 16 , 1940 . Willkie 's Stand gxplained Request for Elucidation of Acceptance Speech Evokes Reply To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : You publish a communication expressing condemnation of Wendell Willkie through the medium of somewhat ironic requests for elucidation of parts of his acceptance speech . In the first place , Mr. Willkie , despite your correspondent 's demand for elucidation of his stand on conscription , has already expressed definite support . He repeated it two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbled last night in the Senate . Next your correspondent wants light on Mr. Willkie 's claim that he was a liberal before many New Dealers had heard the word . That 's plain enough . When did Mr. Flynn , newly appointed manager for the Roosevelt campaign , hear the word ? When did Mr. Kelly of . Chicago hear it before he tried to stampede the Roosevelt convention ? When did Mayor Hague ever hear it ? When did Tammany get as far as " L " in the dictionary ? Now comes the challenge to Hitler . That is also plain enough . Mr. Willkie did pot , as claimed , say that he would beat Hitler in 1940 . He said that if Hitler started a contest in 1940 or later he ( Mr. Willkie ) , if elected , would undertake to lead the nation to victory whether the war was military , industrial or political . As for the ' famous debate challenge , many people have already pointed out that Mr. Roosevelt ca n't have his cake and eat it too . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidency under conditions of unusual gravity . As such he ca n't logically claim immunity from attack . The New Dealers may think he is indispensable , but many citizens think otherwise and they have a right to be heard . Candidate Willkie challenges Candidate Roosevelt to debate . What 's wrong about that ? Your correspondent also says that Roosevelt has been President for seven years and that his policies are known to all . That would be fine , if true . I wish that your correspondent , or any one else for that matter , would tell me just what Mr. Roosevelt 's policies are . Except in rare instances I 've never been able to find out . As an example , for two years he was all for business . Then for six years he was all against it . Now he seems to be all for it again . Even in the most recent matter of the third term Mr. Roosevelt could n't , or would n't , make up his mind for more than a year . We were n't told until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every one agrees that these are grave months for the President . And that is why Mr. Roosevelt did such a grave disservice to the nation , not only by becoming a candidate in opposition to one of the cherished traditions of this country , but also in the attempt by himself and by his followers to avoid discussion of the past seven years . FRANCIS KINGSLEY . New York , Aug. 29 , 1940 . Those Secret Weapons To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK . TIMES : One never knows what to expect of the British . During the early stages of the war we heard broad whisperings of a new deadly , secret German weapon . Speculation described it as an explosive that would blow the British Isles from the seas with a single detonation ; others had it as a giant armada of flying fortresses convoying tanks , munitions and men by the millions ; still others claimed an alliance between the South Irish banshees and the Berlin government in return for which a victory for the Nazis would bring in exchange the permanent freedom of Eire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the Nazis after all who possess the secret weapon . It 's those amazing British ! Berlin claims the British are using a secret varnish to make their raiding planes invisible . Next we 'll hear that Topper , Yahoudi and the Invisible Man are riding the sky lanes to Berlin in the service of the R. A. F. JoHN E. SCHLADIP . New York , Aug. 30 , 1940 . " Psst !  - -  To the Bar ! " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Getting the attention of an inattentive waiter , as discussed in your editorial " The Inadvisability of Psst , " by dropping a spoon on the floor , striking a tumbler with a knife or saying " Psst ! " certainly would make it a noisy world but would it be less noisy if every one raised the right hand and snapped the fingers ? The gentlefolk will probably think better of your alternate suggestion , " to move unerringly to the bar and take steps to forget it all . " ANDREW J. JORDAN . River Edge , N.
