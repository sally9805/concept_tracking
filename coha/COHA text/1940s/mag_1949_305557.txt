Gas lanterns hissed faintly as Premier Sun Fo last week rose to speak before China 's Legislative Yuan in Nanking . There was only scattered applause . When Sun announced he would resign the applause was much louder . Most of the lawmakers had already decided that Sun Fo and his cabinet , who had split Acting President Li Tsung-jen 's government by setting up shop in Canton , were delaying peace with the Communists . <P> After the meeting , in the privacy of his own home , Sun wearily spoke his mind : " The new government , no matter who heads it , will face even worse difficulties than mine . " China had little hope , he added , of negotiating a satisfactory peace with the Communists or of holding off the Reds if fighting was resumed . <P> President Li had already picked his new Premier ; precise , poker-faced General Ho Ying-chin , formerly Minister of National Defense and chief delegate to the U.N . Military Committee . In Hangchow to pass his 60th birthday , Ho first demurred that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Ferociously anti-Communist during his long years of loyalty to the Gimo , Ho attended Buchmanite moral rearmament meetings while in the U.S. , decided he must " fight idea with idea " rather than " force with force . " After the Japanese surrender , Ho opposed Chiang 's policy of attempting to hold Manchuria against the Communists . In 1948 he spurned Chiang 's offer of the premiership . <P> While Li Tsung-jen consolidated his political camp , there came menacing news from across the Yangtze . The Reds were shifting armies closer to Nanking ; along roads north of the river a steady stream of rice-laden wheelbarrows and donkey carts were building up Communist food reserves . Engines were being dismounted from trucks for installation in river craft . To aid their battle of ideas , the Reds were cocking a gun .
