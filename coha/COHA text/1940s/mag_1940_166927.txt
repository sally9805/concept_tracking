When Teddy Roosevelt was trustbusting , Omaha 's most grandiose mansion was Joslyn Castle . Daring schoolboys pressed their noses against the glass of its greenhouse for a peek at the Joslyn orchids . Their elders exclaimed over the turreted grey pile 's pipe organ . But in local society , even organ and orchids could never quite let George Joslyn and his wife Sarah live down the rumor that their fortunes were founded on a quack cure for gonorrhea ( " Big G " ) . The Joslyns went to Omaha in 1880 with $9 and two suitcases . In 1916 sharp-eyed George Joslyn left his wife an estate of $5,200,000 , made mostly from the Western Newspaper Union ( boilerplate insides for small-town papers ) . <P> Sarah Selleck Joslyn spent years planning a memorial for her husband , finally hit on a combined art gallery and concert hall which could house the beloved organ he had played with player rolls . After the $2,900,000 pink marble Joslyn Memorial was opened in 1931 , she used to visit it and put player rolls on the organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she stayed bedridden in Joslyn Castle . <P> Only thing Nebraska had ever seen to rival Mrs. Joslyn 's gift was a prairie sunset . But the Memorial 's art had nearly all been bought in that happy era when money was good and taste was bad . Typical of its contents : a large , lush Bouguereau , Bonheur 's Cattle and Landscape , a collection of Egyptian antiquities . Little of the $1,700,000 endowment Mrs. Joslyn gave it was spent on accessions . <P> Over at Lincoln , Nebraska 's capital and seat of her university , the Nebraska Art Association sprouted a decade after the Joslyns blew into Omaha . Last week , to celebrate its 50th annual show , the Association 's galleries ( upstairs from the fossils in the Nebraska State Museum ) were crammed to overflowing with a first rate loan exhibition of U. S. art and a selection of 50 paintings from its own permanent collection . Since 1928 the Association and the University of Nebraska ( together spending some $5,000 a year ) have bought from similar shows the work of Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood , Morris Kantor , Leon Kroll , Edward Hopper , William Glackens , Reginald Marsh , many another artist . <P> In its first five days last week , the Association 's show drew 15,000 of Lincoln 's 86,000 citizens . On the week 's fourth day , 89-year-old Sarah Selleck Joslyn died in Joslyn Castle . Behind her , solid and pink , she left her marble gesture to the prairies , a reminder to other mortal Nebraskans not to be too proud .
