Texas &; Berlin THE LEANING TOWER AND OTHER STORIES - Katharine Anne Porter - Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES ( 1944 ) - Edited by Martha Foley - Houghton , Mifflin ( $2.75 ) . <P> Grandmother Sophia Jane had raised eleven children . " She wore a stiffly starched white chambray bonnet , with a round crown buttoned on a narrow brim . " When the cling-peach tree bloomed in her Kentucky garden , she mused : " I have planted five orchards in three States , and now I see only one tree in bloom . " Her numerous descendants and her aged servants thought she was the most wonderful , most terrifyingly efficient person alive . <P> Nannie , born into slavery , had lived all her life with Grandmother Sophia Jane . At 85 she retired to a little cabin , wrapped a blue bandanna about her head , smoked a corncob for the first time and thought about the 13 children she had borne ( eleven had died ) . Sometimes she worried over what God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonsense ! " snapped Grand mother Sophia Jane . " He sees only souls . . . . Of course you 're going to Heaven . " <P> Uncle Jimbilly was Nannie 's husband and Grandmother 's odd-job man . He liked to carve miniature tombstones in wood , but he got angry when asked to inscribe " Safe in Heaven " over the tomb of the children 's pet jackrabbit . Children goggled and thrilled when Uncle Jimbilly casually remarked that he would cut off their ears , skin them alive and nail their skins to the barn door . <P> The grandchildren lived on the out skirts of the old peoples ' world , watching with awe the unchanging routine and deep-set beliefs of Grandmother , Nannie and Uncle Jimbilly . But away from this dying world they danced with the freedom of the new generation around the family graves that Grandmother had arranged among the cypresses . <P> Cake Crumbs from Childhood . Six of the nine short stories in The Leaning Tower are crumbs from this cake of childhood-gentle , affectionate epitaphs for a dead world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than like separate short stories . They spring from the grass roots as clearly as their author does . Katherine Anne Porter has become one of the intelligentsia 's most admired short-story writers . She has lived in most of the intelligentsia 's favorite prewar haunts : Paris , Majorca , Berlin , Vienna and Mexico . But she was born in Texas and schooled in Louisiana convents , now lives on a farm near Saratoga Springs . <P> Some readers may be more impressed by The Leaning Tower 's long ( 100 pages ) title story , set in the Berlin of 1931 , than by its vignettes of Texas . The elements of this story are a few dingy streets , a beerhouse , a room filled with " the winter day like dirty water , " and five principal characters : a gawky young Texas artist ; an aristocratic student from Heidelberg with a freshly gashed dueling scar on his cheek ; a wolfish but pathetic landlady ; Polish pianist ; a browbeaten , impecunious professor of mathematics . Out of these Author Porter has carefully built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tragedy - a leaning tower ready to fall at the touch of a strong hand .
