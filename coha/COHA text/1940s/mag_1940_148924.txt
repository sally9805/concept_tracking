To outsiders , Jehovah 's Witnesses are without doubt the most irritating of U. S. sects . They clatter about the country in jalopies , often a couple to a car , the man in overalls , the woman in calico . They ring doorbells , ask whoever answers to listen to their phonograph records attacking all " organized religion " ( the Roman Catholic church in particular ) as a racket . They disregard the law because they owe allegiance to " none but God . " In school their children refuse to salute the flag , believing that it is a graven image . Last week into clink from Maine to Texas as alleged spies , radicals , fifth columnists and non-patriots bounced Bible-dizzy but patently sincere Jehovah 's Witnesses . At Litchfield , 111. , townsfolk mobbed a Witness motorcade , wrecked its cars . Police rushed 61 Witnesses to the city jail , then had to call for State policemen and neighboring sheriffs to protect the jail . <P> Liberals as well as conservatives gave the Witnesses short shrift . Mayor Maury Maverick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , swore their refusal to salute the U. S. flag was an " overt act . " But Republican Maine had the worst riots . At Kennebunk last week . Witness headquarters were sacked , burned by an angry mob . There and in nearby towns private houses were raided , Witnesses dragged out and beaten up . <P> Trouble at Kennebunk began when patriotic natives concluded that Witnesses were spreading subversive doctrines . When a threatening group marched to " Kingdom Hall , " flimsy frame headquarters of the Witnesses , late one night , two got potted with buckshot . Next morning a mob of 2,000 set fire to Kingdom Hall . Police clapped its six occupants into jail for assault with intent to kill , later jailed two of the 2,000 for arson . Then the riots began . By the second night mobs were hunting victims . At Wells , Me. , a crowd went to one man 's house , demanding to know whether he was a Witness and whether he would salute the flag . Reported A. P. : " When the man denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd became abusive and threw stones at the house . " Not until calmer heads pointed out that throwing stones would do no good to Maine 's summer tourist season did thrifty Down-Easterners stay their hands . <P> At week 's end , with little Witness literature left unburned in Maine , three Witness defendants were under protective guard in the jail of another county , three in hiding after giving bail .
