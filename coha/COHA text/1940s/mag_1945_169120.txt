Canada 's Prime Minister threw the weight of his prestige into Grey North 's all-important by-election ( TIME , Jan. 1 ; Jan. 15 ) . In a statement addressed to Grey North voters , but directed to all Canada , William Lyon Mackenzie King urged the Ontario riding to elect Liberal Candidate Andrew G. L. McNaughton , National Defense Minister . Should McNaughton be defeated , he strongly implied , Parliament would not meet at all . <P> The Prime Minister also said that if General McNaughton were elected , the session would be short , and that there would be a general election call " within a few months , " certainly before Parliament 's legal life ends April 17 . <P> Mr. King thus categorically ruled out the much discussed possibility that Parliament 's life might be extended . Political visibility was better , but a light fog remained . Some observers close to the Prime Minister hazarded the idea that he might try to catch opposition parties off balance by dissolving Parliament before Grey North voted . This would mean that there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general election just about the time an Allied spring offensive might be expected in Europe-good voting weather for Mr. King .
