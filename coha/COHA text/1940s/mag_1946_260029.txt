Esquire magazine has n't had a girl it could call its own since a judge gave the Varga girl back to aggrieved Artist Alberto Vargas ( TIME , May 13 ) . Vargas said he had been outsmarted in the fine print of his contract with Esquire 's Publisher David Smart . Last week at a Hollywood cocktail party , Publisher Smart unveiled the Varga Girl 's successor . The new deal was not one girl but a gallery full , drawn not by one artist but by 17 of them . <P> For his best paid and most featured new girls , Smart signed on a pair of Hollywood studio draftsmen named Joseph De Mers and Fritz Willis , who work mostly as a team , passing the drawing board back and forth . Says De Mers : " I paint a while and he paints a while . " Every month for the next three years they have contracted to produce , individually or together , five versions of the girl ( see cut ) . Their fee : $1,000 a throw . <P> Esquire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire for the De Mers-Willis girl ( " Her glance is as predatory as some wild thing , her movements as lithe and bodily outspoken as those of some jungle creature . " ) . Apparently no one had passed him the word that Esquire had changed its tune . Said Publisher Smart : " The Varga Girl gave you the idea she could n't do anything but recline . The new Esquire Girl is more wholesome . She 's the kind of a girl you 'd marry , or try to . She 'll be regular art-museum stuff . " <P> Peru-born Artist Vargas , on his own now , intends to put out girlie calendars like the ones he did for Esquire . The new Varga Girl too , for reasons unexplained , is going to be less sultry . Said Vargas : " She 's teen-age and decent . She will wear little playsuits and be more covered up . "
