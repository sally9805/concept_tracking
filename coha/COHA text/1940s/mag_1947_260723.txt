The big DC-6 American Airliner , with 25 aboard , had just passed over Gallup , New Mexico when the fire broke out . Pilot Evan Chatfield swung back for the field at Gallup , praying for time to make it . He did . Fire trucks quickly snuffed out the blaze . The damage was small-only a foot-square hole in the plane . But the near-catastrophe frightened the airlines . <P> It was the second fire aboard a DC-6 in three weeks-and both had started near the gasoline-burning heater under the cabin floor . The other plane , a United ship , with 52 aboard , had crashed ( TIME , Nov. 3 ) , with no survivors . But the Civil Aeronautics Board had seen enough to order the magnesium emergency landing flares taken out of all DC-6s-a step the lines themselves had long advocated . In the second fire , the airliner may have been saved by the fact that it had no flares to add to the fire . <P> Action . Eleven hours after the Gallup fire , American Airlines ' Board Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we know " the reason for the fires . Shortly after , United Air Lines ' President W. A. Patterson grounded United 's 34 DC-6s . President Truman 's own Independence , a DC-6 , came under the quarantine . <P> Donald W. Douglas , whose Douglas Aircraft Co. had poured $13,400,000 of engineering and research and $1,500,000 of testing into the DC-6 , concurred . Until the trouble was found , said Douglas , " all further passenger flying in these airplanes should be discontinued . " It was the first time that a whole line of transport planes ( there were 75 in service ) had been grounded without a governmental order . <P> Estimate . As investigators went over the Gallup plane , suspicion at first centered on the heating system . The Sixes have had trouble recently when both the heating and pressurizing systems were working . But tests showed no fault in the heater . Investigators suspected another cause . This was that gasoline , overflowing from the wing tanks , had caught fire as it was vented under the fuselage just forward of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , Douglas estimated that modifications could be made in a short time . But the Sixes would stay on the ground until CAB and Douglas were sure they had eliminated the cause .
