Joseph Davies was off this week on a second mission to Moscow . In his well-packed luggage the rich , Russophile ex-Ambassador to Russia carried enough de hydrated foods of the right kind to humor his delicate stomach ( he had rested for three weeks in Boston 's Lahey Clinic pre paring for the trip ) . More important , in his brief case he bore a note whose con tents were known only to Franklin Roosevelt and his secretary , Grace Tully - a note addressed personally to Joseph Stalin . <P> Behind him , Joe Davies left one of the hottest intellectual hubbubs in years . The movie , Mission to Moscow ( TIME , May 10 ) , had not yet reached the rest of the U.S. , as a whole , but by the time it did , no citizen who can read English will be unaware that the movie is Hollywood 's most controversial film ever . <P> In Manhattan the intelligentsia was in full cry . Asked the critics : Was this movie , which deliberately twisted fact and his tory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way to improve those relations ? Was it fair and honest to present such a distortion of momentous events to the U.S. people as final truth ? In unusual accord , critics , historians , columnists answered " No . " Only all-out praise came from Communists . The New Masses thought it " just about a perfect film . . . which strips away the veils of illusions and lies . " Daily Worker Columnist Mike Gold found it " about the best propaganda picture I 've ever seen . . . patriotic , fearless . " <P> From those less conditioned to Stalinist reflexes , the reactions were different . The New York Times 's sober Anne O'Hare McCormick argued that the film " fails utterly to do justice to Russia , grossly misrepresents the United States , and would not sell international cooperation to anybody . " Author Max Eastman ( Stalin 's Russia and the Crisis in Socialism ) considered it " the high point of a wave of national self-abasement . " Literary Critic Edmund Wilson , a onetime Marxist , saw it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It has been suggested that this film needs cutting , " wrote Columnist Dorothy Thompson . " It does-indefinitely . " <P> Totalitarian Propaganda ? But the most complete exposition of the movie 's errors and the most withering critique of its objectives came from aging Philosopher John Dewey , a socialist exponent of Yankee pragmatism . Together with Author Suzanne La Follette ( with whom he had investigated the Moscow purge trials ) he condemned Mission to Moscow in a 2,000-word letter to the New York Times . <P> Said able Critics Dewey and La Follette : " Mission to Moscow is the first instance in our country of totalitarian propaganda for mass consumption . " <P> They recalled that the film takes considerable liberty with the purge trials . " The film telescopes the trial of 1937 and that of 1938 . Dramatic license might possibly excuse this . . . . But there is no excuse for including as an accused in this synthetic trial Marshal Tukhachevsky , who was secretly executed in June 1937 , after no trial at all. * To show Marshal Tukhachevsky having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda . It does not serve the interests of ' truth about Russia . ' "
