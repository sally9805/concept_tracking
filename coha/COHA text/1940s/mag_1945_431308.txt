Let 's suppose you are sitting in a comfortable chair beside the window , all settled down to enjoy this article , Now lift your eyes and look out the window , notice what the weather is like , and then turn back to your reading . How long did it take you ? two seconds , maybe ? Well , during those two seconds , 32 million tons of water fell on the face of the earth and somewhere another of today 's 44,000 thunderstorms started off with a clap of thunder . With all that water tumbling out of the skies in the form of rain and snow , and all those thunderstorms slamming and banging their way across the world , you may be less inclined to grumble about the terrible weather you sometimes have . It could be a lot worse . Next time a shower comes up and spoils your picnic , think of the people who may have planned picnics in the County of Norfolk , in England , on a certain day in 1912 when 670,720,000 tons of water fell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold spell in your part of the country , think of the all-time record of 90.4 degrees below zero recorded in Siberia on February 5 , 1892 . Or maybe it has been uncomfortably warm ? It was 136 degrees in the shade in Azizia , Libya , on September 13 , 1922 . Now do you feel better ? As a matter of fact , we are pretty lucky about our weather in the United  | States . We hold hardly any of the world 's records for orneriness of heat , cold , snow , rain , or storms . Truly we live in the Temperate zone . Weather records of the unpleasant kind are much more likely to be made in the tropical regions to the south or the polar belt to the north . We do have our little specialties . The tornado , for instance . Call it a prairie twister or a cyclone , it is still the deadliest storm on earth . Nobody knows the speed of the wind in its dangling tail , but 500 miles an hour is one serious guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Central and Southeastern states . They are a springtime phenomenon , produced by a top-heavy mass of cold air sliding over unstable warm air , so a whirling motion is set up . When a tornado passes over a pond or lake , it may suck up considerable quantities of water ? and even fish . That is  | one explanation of the " rains of fish " that are reported occasionally , for a tornado may carry the contents of a pond for scores of miles before it wears out and lets everything drop . A tornado over the ocean takes the form of a waterspout . Sailors in the Middle Ages thought waterspouts were living things that could be scared away by cannon balls . Some people still believe that gunfire will disperse a waterspout , just as they believe that shell explosions will produce'rain . Neither belief is true . The natural forces that give rise to waterspouts and rain are incomparably vaster and more powerful than the explosions of any man-made artillery . Incidentally , waterspouts have been measured by surveying instruments often enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found to be only 100 feet high and 700 feet thick ; another , in the South Pacific , was a record breaker for height-5,014 feet high , almost a mile . IN THE past six years the Eastern seaboard , particularly New England , has had two ripsnorting hurricanes that came roaring up from the tropic seas below the West Indies . This is the same type of storm as the typhoons that last fall grounded our air forces for days at a time in the Philippines . In Australia they call it the willy-willy . But wherever it occurs , it- is a destructive killer . If the tornado is concentrated force , like a bullet drilling through a plate-glass window , the hurricane is brute , mass force ? a ten-ton truck crashing through the glass . Easterners who were still cutting up trees felled by the 1938 hurricane when the 1944 blowdown came along can be excused for wondering if the weather has the hurricane habit and is planning to put on a show at shorter and shorter intervals . They do n't need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coincidence . As a matter of fact , there have been more than 150 of them along our Southeastern coast , or farther north , since the Civil War , and they Weather Bureau figures on an average of two a year in the Southeast . About every third year one of them is likely to be a lulu . Hurricanes , like all other storms , are just weather ? the same old ingredients of air , water , heat , and cold that , under different circumstances , can produce a ' pleasant summer day . The storm starts near the Equator as a gigantic wheel of air , set in motion by a play of forces that even the professional weathermen still argue about . Once started whirling , like a monster phonograph record 300 to 600 miles across , it slowly swings west , north , and finally east in a vast arc . Most hurricanes are shunted out to sea by a pressure barrier of air over the eastern part of the United States before they do much damage ; but now and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane sneaks through and may reach-Canada before it drifts off to sea . When it does , the damage is likely to reach wardebt proportions . The 1938 hurricane cost $500,000,000 in property damage alone and was the worst storm in recorded history . Incidentally , considering how important hurricanes , typhoons , cyclones , and tornadoes are in our lives , it is astonishing that we know so little about the storms of long ago . The earliest storm we know much about dates from only Noember , 1703 . It was a hurricane that  | drowned 8,000 sailors and killed 123 persons on land in England . Daniel Defoe , the author of Robinson Crusoe , wrote a book about it , The Storm . It is odd that about 240 years later an American author also wrote an immensely popular book with the same title . The American , however , knew a good deal more about the mechanics of a storm than Defoe did . For one thing , most of the science of forecasting the weather has come into being since Defoe 's day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance , ' just what the weather is going to be . Within the first few hours of predicting they claim to be 95 percent right , 85 to 90 percent accurate after 24 hours , and 85 percent on the nose even 36 hours after making a forecast . In Defoe 's time forecasting was not much more than the application of weather proverbs , farmers ' and sailors ' rhymes about the condition of the sky , and experienced observation of " weather signs " in one 's immediate neighborhood . It was usually just luck if such forecasts were right more than 12 hours in advance . The time is coming when our Weather Bureau will be able to tell you weeks ahead what to expect in a given period , or perhaps what a whole season will be like . Weathermen are working hard on long-range forecasting , a complex process that involves much higher mathematics , analyses of the great air masses all over the world , soundings of the air far above the earth , and so on . IF YOU did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this magazine a few minutes ago , you can take comfort from a couple of facts : no weather is permanent and even our national climate is changing . Elderly people often say we do n't have old-fashioned winters any more . There is a certain amount of truth in their claim , for in the past twenty-five years there has been a conspicuous trend toward warmer weather over the country as a whole . In the preceding twenty-five years the average temperatures for this country were distinctly on the cold side . Still , twenty-five or even fifty years is a mere flash of time when it comes to such a ponderous affair as a permanent climatic change , and the promoters of winter sports do n't need to worry about our warmer winters . It is quite possible that in any given spot in this country , or even over the entire country , next winter may be colder and snowier than anything Grandfather ever heard his grandfather tell about . Nobody knows really what causes such a climatic change . Basically , of course , all weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of varying temperatures and moisture content . Meteorologists say , with a tentative note in their voices , that maybe a change in the circulation of the air is responsible for the trend toward warmer winters . Well , what causes the air circulation to change ? The meteorologists stare moodily out the window and talk learnedly of sunspots . They do n't know ? yet . But whatever the weather you are having at this particular moment , it is a good idea to remember those 32 million tons of water falling every two seconds , and those 44,000 thunderstorms every day . Just remember ? and be glad your weather is n't any worse !  |
