Sinews of Peace . If tired steel workers hoped that the end of war orders would mean a cut in overtime , they were disappointed . Last week , in a back-breaking effort to keep pace with steel orders , many steelmen were still putting in 60 to 96 hours a week . Mills were operating at close to 80% of capacity , highest peacetime production ever , with no let up in sight this year . <P> Unfair . Railroad men winced at airline advertising gleefully announcing the end of air-travel priorities by Oct. 15 . Quietly the railroads were urging that : 1 ) the Office of Defense Transportation relax its ban on sleeping-car runs of less than 450 miles ; 2 ) the Army turn back a few of the 895 sleepers grabbed from the railroads in July , when troop movements were at their peak . <P> Short Careers . The U.S. Maritime Commission put up for sale , as junk , four Liberty ships war-damaged beyond repair . Two of them had been torpedoed , one had been bombed , one had crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ships are bought for scrap , purchasers must agree to destroy all motors , engines and other salvageable gear . Reason : to keep these items off an already glutted market . So far the Maritime Commission has received bids for two of the ships : $3,100 and $9,100 ( they had cost upward of $1.5 million apiece ) .
