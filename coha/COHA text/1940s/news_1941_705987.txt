txt ASKS FOR LOYALTY President Calls on Mine Chiefs to ' Come to Aid of Your Country ' CITES PERIL TO FREEDOMS He Tells Lewis That Taylor Is Ready to Meet With Him on Union Shop Issue By LOUIS STARK Special to TaE NEW YORE TimEs . WASHINGTON , Oct. ** an eleventh hour appeal to John L. Lewis and his associate officers of the United Mine Workers , " as loyal citizens , to come now to the aid of your country , " President Roosevelt tonight called for reconsideration of the decision which ended the truce in the captive coal mines of big steel corporations and resulted in the calling out of 53,000 workers on strike . Following his return from a brief afternoon cruise on the Potomac the President wrote to Mr. Lewis acknowledging his letter of yesterday refusing to continue the captive mines in operation as he had been requested to do by Mr. Roosevelt on Friday . " In this crisis of our national life there must be uninterrupted production of coal for making steel , that basic material of our national defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the preservation of our freedoms , yours and mine ; those freedoms upon which the very existence of the United Mine Workers of America depends . " Taylor Prepared to Act The President pointed out that Myron C. Taylor , former chairman of the board of the United States Steel Company , which owns some of the captive mines , was prepared to meet Mr. Lewis Wednesday " to see if you and he in private and personal conference can work out a peaceful solution of the problem . ' At issue is a demand for the union shop . Since Mr. Lewis had agreed to meet Mr. Taylor , the President urged that " work continue at the captive mines pending the settlement of the dispute . " THE PRESIDENT 'S LETTER The text of the President 's letter to Mr. Lewis follows : Dear Mr. Lewis : I acknowledge your letter of yesterday . You say that you do not feel warranted in recommending an additional extension of the temporary agreement to keep the captive mines in operation pending a final settlement of the controversy . i must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our national life there must be uninterrupted production of coal for making steel , that basic material of our national defense . That is essential to the preservation c ' our freedoms , yours and nine ; those freedoms upon which the very existence of the United Mine Workers of America depends . Mr. Myron Taylor is prepared to meet with you on Wednesday , to see if you and he in private and personal conference can work out a peaceful solution of the problem . You have agreed to confer with Mr. ' r'aylor . During such conferences the production of coal for steelmaking by the mine workers under the established wage scales of the Appalachian agreement should continue in the broad interest of the safety and defense of the nation . I am , therefore , as President of the United States , asking you and your associated officers of the United Mine Workers of America , as loyal citizens , to come now to the aid of your country . I ask that work continue at the captive coal mines pending the settlement of the dispute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observers here felt that in makng his appeal as President of the Jnited States to the patriotism of // ROOSEVELT MAKES NEW LEWIS APPEAL // the officers of the miners ' union Mr. Roosevelt had played a trump card which could not be topped by Mr. Lewis . The appeal , whether so intended or not , places Mr. Lewis " on the spot " before the country , for it is the view of the high circles in the Administration that he will be judged on one point solely , whether or not he gives the order to return the miners to work tomorrow . The strike order became effective at midnight last night , but as no coal is mined on Sunday the effective strike date is tomorrow . Mr. Lewis was reported as unlikely to do anything until tomorrow morning . If he orders the truce resumed , the miners could return to the pits in a few hours . The obvious restraint of the President in his letter to Mr. Lewis was noted by observers . He ignored completely Mr. Lewis 's personal attacks on Sidney Hillman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the National Defense Mediation Board . Viewed as Last Mild Plea While Mr. Roosevelt , it was apparent , acted as if he were " turning the other cheek , " it was felt in Administration quarters that it would probably be the last time that he would resort to " the soft answer that turneth away wrath . " There was considerable speculation here as to what the President might do if the chief of the miners union resists his new plea . The issue has now been drawn between the Chief Executive and Mr. Lewis . As guests on his cruise today the President had Lord Halifax , the British Ambassador , Lady Halifax , and Clement Attlee , leader of the British Labor party , who is Lord Privy Seal and deputy Prime Minister . Major Attlee is here to attend the conference of the International Labor Organization . Also aboard were the President 's son , Captain James Roosevelt , and the President 's naval aide , Captain James R. Beardall . Harry L. Hopkins and Supreme Court Justice Samuel Rosenman of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House the President 's return and were understood to be extremely interested in the projected statement on the coal situation . Speculation in Congressional circles was concerned with the possible methods of dealing with the situation should there be continued defiance of the Presidential request to continue production in the mines . The shut-down threatens serious crippling of steel production . Surmised Courses of Action Several courses of action are said to be open to the President . One would be to summarize the situation for Congress and to request that it act promptly to deal with the strike . A law to ban the closed shop in defense industries for the emergency is one proposal that has been discussed . Such a law would take away from Mr. Lewis his hope of forcing the operators to grant the union shop in the captive mines . However , it would not end the strike if the chief of the union withheld the order for the men to return to the pits . It is being suggested that the President might appeal to the miners over the head of Mr. Lewis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President should appeal to Philip Murray , president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations . Under this procedure an emergency meeting of the C. I. 0 . executive board might be called to exercise pressure on Mr. Lewis , who is a member of the board . At the office of the National Defense Mediation Board it was said that nothing further could be expected from the board , as the dispute was out of its hands . The mediation board had suggested that miners and operators give to the full board of eleven members the authority to make a binding arbitration award in the dispute . As an alternative it suggested that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Taylor agree to head a joint board of operators and miners to negotiate directly . A third proposal was that , in case of disagreement , this joint board would select an arbitrator who would have the power to make a final binding decision . Under the proposals of the Mediation Board the truce would re ' main in effect . This truce was arranged by the Mediation Board Sept. 19 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that if either side wished to terminate it . Issue Left Open by Board Mr. Lewis announced on Wednesday that the truce would be ended last night . On Friday , twenty-four hours before the expiration of the truce , the board issued a decision refusing to pass on the demand for the union shop . This decision was prompted part ' ly by the fact that the closed shop is an issue in current negotiations between the C. I. 0 . and " Little Steel " and would , if granted in the captive mines , influence those parleys , as well as affect the current contract between the C. I. 0 . ' s Steel Workers Organization Committee and other steel corporations , principally the United States Steel Corporation . The latter employs about 20,000 men in its captive mines . A Mediation Board decision on the union shop would also affect the relations between the C. I. 0 . Industrial Union of Marine Shipbuilders and the Federal Shipbuilding Company . When this company , a subsidiary of United States Steel Corporation , refuqed the board 's recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its shipyards at Kearny , N. J. , were taken over by the government and they are being operated by the Navy Department .
