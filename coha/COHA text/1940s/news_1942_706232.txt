txt The War Labor Board has taken jurisdiction in the dispute between the General Motors Corporation and the union in its plants over the question whether double-time shall be paid for Sunday work . The demands of the United Automobile Workers in the General Motors Corporation for wage increases of $1 a day and the closed shop will also presumably soon come before the board . Still a third question to . e placed before the board is the dispute between the Steel Workers Organizing Committee and the Bethlehem Steel Company concerning the union 's demand for an increase of $1 a day in the prevailing basic rate , now $5.80 , union recognition and the checkoff . The terms on which the General Motors and Bethlehem Steel disputes are settled are expected to fix the terms in the entire automobile and steel industries . The decision on double pay for Sundays will obviously affect war work everywhere . Yet the War Labor Board , following the dep ! orable precedent of the National Defense Mediation Board , has still failed to announce a definite wartime labor policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board fiction that it " has no policy " but is merely deciding Bach case " on its own merits . " It is obvious to every one else , however , that when 1 it settles a particular dispute it establishes controlling precedents of principle that can not fail to influence all subsequent decisions . It is obvious that if there is to be order and not chaos in labor relations , particular disputes must be settled within the framework of a consistent labor policy the leading principles of which are clearly understood by the country . If maximum production for war is not to be threatened by unreasonable and disruptive wage demands , if the cost of living is to be held within bounds and an uncontrolled inflation avoided , the Government must announce a definite policy of wage stabilization . Further , if the country 's peril is not to be exploited to change the status quo with regard to the open or closed shop , the War Labor Board must now announce definitely that no demand for a change of this . status quo in any plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small group in the Government nor a small group among union leaders should be permitted to use the war crisis to impose the closed shop upon the country , either candidly or by subterfuge . This is a point which should now be beyond all dispute . The President on Nov. 13 declared flatly that " the Government of the United States will not order , nor will Congress pass legislation ordering , the so-called closed shop . " In a recent Gallup survey 77 per cent of those asked disapproved of the closed shop and only 13 per cent expressed approval . In the Smith bill the House , clearly reflecting the opinion of the country , voted 252 to 136 for a labor measure containing a provision to freeze the open or closed shop status during the emergency . If after all this the War Labor Board refuses to adopt such a policy , then it is the duty of Congress promptly to pass legislation ordering it to do so .                  @ @ @
