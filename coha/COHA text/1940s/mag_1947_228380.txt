AN ESSAY ON MORALS ( 204 pp. ) - Philip Wylie-Rinehart ( $2.50 ) . <P> Philip Wylie makes a good living out of his writing , and spends most of the year in Florida . But from reading his stuff , you would think he lived in a Grub Street attic , with specially trained vultures tearing at his liver . <P> This studiedly angry study in moral philosophy is charged with the same sophomoric ferocity as his best-selling Generation of Vipers was . But this time Wylie has some leaflets to scatter as well . <P> Wylie thinks he has the answer for juvenile delinquency , the high divorce rate , national psychoses such as Naziism and " iron curtains . " He presents his answers , as usual , in ups &; downs of personal sharpness and pseudo-scientific bombast , glib epigrams and gassy notions , often pungent and more often appallingly slipshod prose . At his best , Iconoclast Wylie pinpricks as sharply as H. L. Mencken ; at his worst , he is as full of unenlightening heat as Westbrook Pegler . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Author Wylie 's philosophy , and he defines it as famed Psychiatrist Carl Jung did , as the " collective unconscious , " i.e. , the idea that hidden in all men is a " common instinct " or basic " energy , " which " governs living behavior in individuals , species , and in evolution . " Individuals and nations that thwart this timeless instinct - either through unnatural laws and institutions or by catering to the day-to-day vanities of the ego - call down upon their heads neuroses , national-madness , and even extinction of their species . <P> Author Wylie has little difficulty in showing that much of U.S. life is lived in opposition to what he calls instinct . He considers it intolerable that crude and artificial concepts of patriotism , economics , racial distinctions or hoary traditions should confine the individual to a limited scope of learning and living . <P> School for Hypocrites . To Author Wylie , the churches and the laboratories are the chief villains of the piece . Modern man , he holds , first created God in his own image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this image to develop into a " school for hypocrites and university of ignorance . " Meanwhile , scientists have gone to the other extreme : in the name of Pure Reason they have omitted morality from their researches . The result : an average citizen who is no better than a " bred sheep " - cut off by church , industry , shibboleths and social fear from self-knowledge and spiritual freedom . <P> " Insight into natural law " is Author Wylie 's proposed solution . Children , he demands , must be taught that they are animals , not souls . They must be suckled not on clerical and patriotic values , but on Darwinism , anthropology , ethnology , Freudianism ( one of Author Wylie 's wilder notions is that some children should be placed on an island , " reached by tunnel from the mainland , " where feeding-bottles and other nourishment will hang from bushes-giving peeking scientists a chance to study inborn faculties at their most virginal ) . Only when the resulting adult is thus " aware " and " conscious in the instinctual sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward experience . "
