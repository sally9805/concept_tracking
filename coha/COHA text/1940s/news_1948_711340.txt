txt The house rules committee , which had the power to kill the peace time draft by pigeonholing it , voted 6 to 4 today to send the bill to the house floor for consideration tomorrow . A prospective deadlock was broken when Rep. Harness ( it. , Ind. ) , a foe of the peace time draft , voted to submit the controversial measure for final decision by the house . Harness , an infantry lieutenant who won the Purple Heart in World War I. , said his vote " is not to be interpreted as personal approval of the measure . " He said he remains uncommitted on the issue and " still entertains doubts as to the wisdom or necessity of authorizing a draft of American man power in peace time . " He asserted , however , that be could not in " good conscience " use his position on the rules committee " to keep this issue from a decision by the whole house . " Name Those Against It The vote was secret , but THE TRIBUNE was informed that the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen ( R. , 111. ) and Representatives Sabath ( D. , 111 . ) , ? Chenoweth ( R. , Colo. ) and Rich ( R. , Pa . ) Rep. - Brown ( R. , 0. ) was reported paired against the bill with Rep. Clark ( D ..

Rizley ( R. , Okla . ) . , Herter ( R. , Mass . ) , Cox ( D. , Ga . ) , ' Smith ( D. , Va. ) , and Harness . Some of the opposition to submitting the bill to a house vote was whipped into line by the Republican leadership , after the senate had voted 78 to 10 for the draft last Thursday . Some of the Republican leaders were understood to be unwilling to face the internationalists ' fire by preventing a house vote . Close Fight Expected The house fight is expected to be much closer and more bi : r than that in the senate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Truman administration draft plan . The committee voted after hearing an appeal from Rep. Si , ort ( R. , Mo. ) not to bankrupt the nation by piling a 2 billion dollar draft on top of the New Deal international spending program . Short charged that the " crisis " for which President Truman has demanded the draft is a fake , and that top military chiefs privately admit there is no need for the draft that Mr. Truman forces them to support publicly . Fears Huge Costs Short was one of five members of the house armed services committee who refused to join the other 18 in approving the bill . He warned that 2 billion dollars more for a peace time draft will skyrocket defense and veterans administration spending . along with the 5 billion dollars interest on the national debt , to 33 billions a year before any normal governmental expense is provided for . Accusing the brass hats of sabotaging voluntary army enlistment to force the draft on the nation , Short said the military chiefs ' peace time interests are .

He was supported by Sabath in the assertion that the admirals and generals confidentially admit h'ile passed theTdhre ihneeeednevd. by voice vote the bill detailing draft the composition of the 70 group air force provided in the law that gave the air ' force an extra 882 million dollars for expansion . The bill authorizes a man power strength of 502,000 and a plane ' strength of 24.000 .

Dictator Of Business Members of congress say the President could make himself the absolute dictator of American business by decreeing the product of recalcitrant corporations was needed in the defense program . The movement to give the President sweeping powers over industry , however , was not initiated by President Truman or the services . Much of the pressure for these powers came from opponents of the draft and members of congress who support the draft on the ground that it is a necessary evil . These members said they would not vote to draft men for peace time service unless industry also could be drafted .

Wherry Against It Majority Leader Wherry ( It , Neb. ) of the senate tried in vain to strike the draft industry section from the draft bill just before the serrate passed the bill . He voiced no specific objection to empowering the President to seize industry , but told the senate the- precedence to be accorded Presidential orders , for supplies would wreck small business by bringing back rfriority contrpls over allocation of scarce materials . Priorities , be said , would lead to peace time institutions corresponding to the war time office of price administration and the war production board . They would allocate hcarce materials to big manufacturers with government contracts , Wherry said , and thus squeeze small companies that needed the same materials out of business .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
