The Big Inch and Little Big Inch pipelines had just closed down nine months ago when the War Assets Administration began to get tongue-in-cheek bids for them . One jokesmith wanted the lines for piping grapefruit juice from Texas to New York . Another thought tough Texas jackrabbits could be profitably run to eastern markets since " anything becomes a delicacy if it is moved far enough . " Even harried WAA officials took time out to join in the fun . Their proposal : start carbonated water through the pipes in Texas , spike it with bourbon in Kentucky , route the piped highballs through the " ice mines of Pennsylvania , and so to the bars of Manhattan . <P> But last week in Washington when WAA publicly read the 16 pipeline bids , it was clear the kidding was at an end .

Holley Poe and Dr. Everette De Golyer topped the $146 million cost of the lines by offering $260 million for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2,815-mile system for natural gas transmission , are favored by Wall Street to win . But the Government will accept their proposals only as a last resort . It wants the lines used for petroleum products , will give first choice to buyers or lessors who promise to use it for them . One reason : Big Inch 's daily throughput of 300,000 barrels of crude , Little Big Inch 's 235,000 barrels of gasoline would be on tap for any national emergency . <P> Who Will Win ? With natural gas bidders handicapped , the real race will probably be run by the petroleum men . Frank M. McGraw offered $146 million* on a lease-sale basis . Ryford Pipeline Co Chicago , representing a group of independent producers , refiners and marketers , offered to buy Little Big Inch for $30 million and lease Big Inch . <P> In a class by itself was the Big Inch Oil Inc. ' s bid of $110 million : $1 million down payment , $65 million on the sale-closing date , $44 million in corporation income debentures . Intending to act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refining or marketing petroleum products ) , Big Inch Oil , Inc. has the added advantage in Government eyes of falling under ICC regulations . <P> <P> * Less 4% depreciation annually from the date of the lines ' full operation : Aug. 1943 for Big Inch and March 1944 for Little Big Inch .
