After six years of slumber Canada 's opposition party turned over in its sleep last week and threatened to wake up and scrap . The Conservatives chose a new Party leader , a downright man with a low opinion of Canada 's war policies . He will have the opportunity of pushing William Lyon Mackenzie King off the narrowing plank on which the Liberal Prime Minister has been teetering since war began . <P> Chief reason that the Prime Minister has been able to edge his way precariously through 25 months of war is that there has been no united opposition . The second strongest party in the Ottawa Parliament has been the Conservatives , which , under the bumbling leadership of amiable Richard Burpee Hanson , has made little headway . Actually the Liberal and Conservative Parties differ chiefly in that one is in , the other out . <P> A fortnight ago the Conservatives began to pull up their socks . Leader Hanson announced that ill health would force him to quit his job . Last week , at a two-day conference in Ottawa , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Party tall , patrician , 67-year-old Senator Arthur Meighen , a lawyer , financier and two-time ( 1920-21 , 1926 ) Prime Minister of Canada . <P> The Conservatives could not have picked a more conservative leader . Nor could they have chosen one more heartily against Mackenzie King . To keep the support of the potent , close-knit French political bloc in Quebec and Ontario , Mackenzie King has soft-pedaled the question of conscription for overseas service , which in the last months has been brought up with increasing vigor by the all-out-for-Britain citizens of the prairie Provinces and the West . Canadian businessmen oppose the excess-profit taxes , the regulations , the price ceilings that the wartime Government has set . And Canadian labor resents wage ceilings quite as much , cites the cases of many labor leaders and radicals locked up under the steel-lined Defense of Canada Regulations to prove that the King Government is antilabor . <P> By contrast , Conservative Meighen , as a member of the Cabinet during World War I , sponsored conscription , earned the Conservatives the lasting and damaging enmity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the quiet backwater of Canada 's appointive Senate , making subacid wisecracks about Mackenzie King 's conduct of the war . He wants overall conscription , abolition of the excess-profits tax . He scoffs at the Prime Minister 's " twilight twittering " about joint Canada-U.S. defense planning , grows rabid because Canada does not ban all U.S. periodicals with an isolationist slant . To Arthur Meighen , above all , Cana da is a unit of the British Commonwealth of Nations . <P> Not until the next session of Parliament , in January , will Leader Meighen be able to assume active command of his Party . Before then he must resign his Senate seat , accept a seat in the House which some Conservative member will , by convention , surrender to him .
