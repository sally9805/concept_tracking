Both management and labor knew that the issue had to be joined eventually . Sooner or later the National Labor Relations Board would have to make one of its biggest decisions since the Taft-Hartley Act became law last summer . Last week , plainly following the letter of the law , NLRB did . It ruled that an employer has no legal obligation to deal with a union whose leaders have refused to sign affidavits that they are not Communists . <P> The board acted on behalf of two companies . The first was Herman Lowenstein , Inc. , a leather manufacturer of Gloversville , N.Y . The company asked the board to hold an election to decide which of two contesting unions might represent its workers . One of the unions was the C.I.O. Fur &; Leather Workers , whose president , Ben Gold , is an avowed Communist and naturally has not signed the affidavit . That ruled out his union as far as the election was concerned . <P> Much more newspaper noise was made two days later by the decision in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rand asked regional boards in Buffalo and Detroit for an election among 10,000 of its employees in six plants , to find out whether they still wanted the C.I.O. 's United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers to bargain for them . <P> U.E. is the largest Communist-dominated union in the land . U.E. 's leaders , from big-bellied Al Fitzgerald down , have denounced the law 's non-Communist clause with furious fervor , have refused to sign the affidavits . This week the company , on the strength of the NLRB ruling , severed relations with U.E. , despite an agreement which runs until April 1949 . <P> Said NLRB 's tough general counsel , Robert N. Denham : if Remington Rand signs a new contract with U.E. , it does so at " its own peril . " NLRB will not help to enforce it . Stormed U.E. 's Fitzgerald : " This is a call to arms to all employers to break contracts . " <P> Observers wondered what employers would do about the 3,000,000 union men , including Phil Murray 's Steelworkers and John Lewis ' A.F.L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York 's Daily News editorialized : " The repercussions may be widespread , even violent . " A Steelworkers ' spokesman in Washington put it this way : " Any company which tries to use the board as an excuse not to bargain will probably be pulling a strike on itself . "
