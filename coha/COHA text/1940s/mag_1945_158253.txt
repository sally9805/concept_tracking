The Government of Premier Ivanoe Bonomi called for the creation of Italy 's own volunteer army . <P> The idea was first suggested by popular , doughty General Arnaldo Azzi . He urged that the Royal Italian Army should be reformed , drop its oath of allegiance to the House of Savoy , change its name to Esercito Nazionale ( National Army ) . For his pains the General was retired . <P> Then the Communist Party announced that it would promote a people 's army . The Socialist and Action Parties , both of the left opposition , added their cordial endorsement . Palmiro Togliatti , who is both Italy 's Vice Premier and Communist Party secretary , presumably took the plan to the Cabinet . Last week the Government added its official blessing . <P> Tired , aging Premier Bonomi was not seeking to add to his burdens . A volunteer army , functioning side by side with Italy 's regular Army , would undoubtedly be a burden of major proportions . But the Government 's demand might goad the unwilling Allies into giving Italy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months . For Premier Bonomi , as for the leftists , the volunteer army was a political weapon .
