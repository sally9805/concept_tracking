Professor Anton R. Zhebrak is a Soviet geneticist who has enjoyed international respect . Like most reputable scientists , he has believed in the Morgan-Mendelian theory of genetics ( i.e. , hereditary characteristics are controlled by genes which can not be altered by ordinary environmental conditions ) . That belief made him a heretic in Russia , where science must take the Communist view that Environment Is All . Last year Zhebrak was roundly denounced by Pravda for admitting in the U.S. weekly , Science , that many Russian geneticists still uphold Mendel 's laws ( TIME , Sept. 22 ) . <P> During the last fortnight Professor Zhebrak has recanted his heresy . " I , as a party member , " said he in a letter to Pravda , " do not consider it possible for me to retain the views which have been recognized as erroneous by the Central Committee of our party . " <P> With Zhebrak 's capitulation , a debate that has gone on in Russia for over a decade came to an end . Henceforth , all vegetables , flowers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marxian line . Under the vigorous influence of their Communist environment , they will cast off all Western bourgeois tendencies that might make them follow their heredity . <P> The man who finally won this longstanding argument is Geneticist Trofim Denisovich Lysenko , president of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences . Lysenko rose to his present eminence by being able to make his science toe the party line . Although Lysenko has gained increasing recognition in Russia , most Western and some Soviet geneticists have regarded his party-line genetics as scientifically naive . <P> This summer , at the eight-day meeting of the Lenin Academy , Lysenko rose to insist on his views once again . Several scientists , including Professor Zhebrak , tried to start the old argument . It was then that Lysenko sprang his big surprise : his theory had been officially endorsed by the Central Committee . <P> Taking its cue , the Academy hastily dashed off a note to Scientist Stalin : " You , our dear leader and teacher , have helped Soviet scientists day in , day out , to develop our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exploits , a science expressing the ideology and lofty aims of the man of the new Socialist society . . . Advanced biological science rejects and pillories the erroneous idea that nature can not be guided by the human control of conditions . " <P> Last week the Academy swung into action . It purged itself of two of its most noted members : Physiologist L. A. Orbeli and Morphologist I. I. Shmalgauzen ; liquidated a laboratory on cytogenetics ( the study of cell formation ) , and accused its director , world-famous Geneticist N. P. Dubinin , of having taken " antiscientific positions . " All textbooks on biology were ordered rewritten ; teaching will be oriented to the Lysenko doctrine .
