In the hemispheric game of making friends ( and thus influencing peoples ) , Argentina is one up on the U.S. As a result , Bolivia , already on a diet of Argentine beef and wheat , now looks to Buenos Aires for much of its folding money . <P> The story is told in terms of Bolivia 's one export crop : tin . For weeks , Bolivia has been dickering with the U.S. Metals Reserve Co. for a 9-a-pound price boost ( to 76 ) on the 20,000 tons it ships annually to the tin-hungry U.S. The U.S. finally offered 74 . Then the Argentines ( who are granting Bolivia a $62,500,000 loan ) stepped in . Argentina contracted for 8,000 tons a year at the Bolivian asking price and agreed to take 12,000 tons more if no other buyers showed up . <P> The odd detail of the deal is that Argentina , which uses only 3,000 tons of tin a year , has no smelter to process the ore . Presumably Argentina will have it smelted in England . But what would she do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smart business to sell it to the U.S.-at a fancy profit .
