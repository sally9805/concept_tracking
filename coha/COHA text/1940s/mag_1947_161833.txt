One thing a camera does superbly is to seize the moment . Last week Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art put on a show of pictures-each made in a wink-which brought back moments from the past decade more vividly than memory can . They were candid camera shots snapped by France 's most distinguished documentary photographer , Henri Carder-Bresson . <P> Unlike artier cameramen , Carder-Bresson has never felt the need of a studio or a darkroom . He still reloads his Leica under the bed , washes his prints in the bathtub . " Shooting a picture , " says he , " is like shooting rabbit or partridge . Before shooting you think , you contemplate , you look , look , look , look . Then you shoot , and get it . " <P> Carder-Bresson began as a painter , and still paints for fun , but at 38 he is primarily a historian . Spain 's Civil War , the people of Mexico , Manhattan 's " Little Italy , " the coronation of England 's George VI , Paris , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been seized in the enduring glimpses of his camera 's glass eye . <P> Carder-Bresson was a corporal in the French army , spent 36 months in German P.W . camps . Twice he escaped and was recaptured . The third try worked . He went underground in Paris , emerged to photograph the liberation of fellow French prisoners by the Allies . Some of the results-such as his picture of a Gestapo informer being recognized by an ecstatically vengeful ex-prisoner at a D.P. interrogation center ( see cut ) - were masterpieces of tragic force . <P> Last week Carder-Bresson contemplated the windowed gorges of Manhattan , while his wife-Javanese Dancer Ratna Mohini - rehearsed for a recital . He took his camera everywhere about the city , peering , with an explorer 's lust for the unknown , into thousands of hurrying faces . " Human faces , " Carder-Bresson mused , " are such a world !
