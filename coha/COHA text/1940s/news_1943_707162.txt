txt Balk Rule Proposal Opposed In his letter in THE TIMES last Saturday Joseph Cunneen advocated that a baseball pitcher should not be penalized for an accidental balk . I read it with interest , but can not agree with his opinion . Who is going to determine whether or not the balk was intentional ? The umpire , of course . And once the present harsh but fair rule is I discarded the task of the arbiters will become much more difficult in such instances . More games likely will be protested if the umpires have discretion in penalizing pitchers for committing balks . In other words Liberalization of the balk rule is not necessary and should not be considered just for the sake of helping the pitchers . WILBUR WAITE . Brooklyn , June 1 , 1943 . Editorial Note : Apparently this fellow is not a pitcher .
