The charges were made in eight indictments opened in Federal court at the instance of United States Attorney John F.

These defendants , he said , obtained opium from Mexico and processed it here , mixing it with milk sugar . The stuff they sold to other distributors , he said , had a narcotic content of 70 per cent . At $600 to $700 an ounce , they sold $3,500,000 to $4,000,000 worth of this , he said . The dealers to whom they sold it added more sugar , and as the narcotic passed through the successive stages of distribution it got weaker and weaker .

The Mexican Government has a perplexing problem in its efforts to discover and eliminate illicit growers there , he said , adding : " Another thing , La Gaipa was a member of the Mafia and so are many others in the illicit drug line . The Mafia is not dead . All of the murders growing out of La Gaipa 's activities were the work of the Mafia . We have now the old Mafia , to which La Gaipa belonged , and the new or American-born Mafia , which believes it can do the old work in a more efficient way .
