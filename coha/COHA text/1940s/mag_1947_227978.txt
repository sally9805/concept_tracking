In 1884 a Sudanese boatman , turned religious seer , involved the British Empire in a sticky little war . Mohamed Ahmed , who had declared himself the Mahdi , the long-awaited messiah of Islamic tradition , had whipped his dervish followers into a frenzied jihad ( holy war ) against the Sudan 's Egyptian rulers . Since Egypt was under British occupation , Britain sent solemn , Bible-reading General Charles George ( " Chinese " ) Gordon* to restore order . Instead , the fanatical dervishes bottled up the undermanned British garrison in Khartoum , hacked Gordon to death with their swords . <P> <P> Thirteen years later , another British army , under General Horatio Herbert Kitchener ( thenceforth known as K of K , Kitchener of Khartoum ) , set out to avenge Gordon . As the dervishes tried to cut their way out in a ferocious surge known as the Battle of Omdurman , a young cavalry officer named Winston Churchill got in the way , nearly lost his life . Dervish power was smashed . <P> Last week the dervish spirit was astir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir Sayed Abdul Rahman Mohamed Ahmed El Mahdi Pasha lacked his father 's messianic complex . But he rode the wave of nationalism that was surging from North Africa to Indonesia . Sir Sayed threatened a second jihad if Egypt won its demand for outright annexation of the Sudan ( now an Anglo-Egyptian condomimium ) . <P> Square Meter in Heaven . This time the British sided not with the Egyptians , but with the Mahdi . The British knew how deeply the Sudanese hate the Egyptians , who still call them Abed ( slaves ) in memory of the times when Sudanese tribesmen were sold down the river to the slave marts of Alexandria and Cairo . The British also knew the value to Britain of the Sudan under sympathetic native rule . <P> Common gratitude would ensure Sir Sayed Abdul Rahman 's sympathy . The British had rescued him from his father 's disgrace , restored his family lands , given him a splendid palace . They had given him lucrative Army contracts for wood . When El Mahdi Pasha promised his followers a square meter in Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodsmen chopped trees with as much zeal as if they had been infidel heads . <P> Last month Sir Sayed flew to London to present his case to Prime Minister Clement Attlee . In the British capital he attracted attention by carrying a lady 's umbrella , established a reputation for generosity by tossing around 100 tips . At No. 10 Downing Street , he talked loudly about Sudanese independence , but added that no one would mind if the British stayed for a while to teach the Sudanese how to run the country . <P> Last week the Mahdi sat quietly in his villa , watching his tame cranes and awaiting the results of his mission . In Cairo , diplomats , hard at work on an Anglo-Egyptian treaty of alliance , were deadlocked over the Sudan 's future . Probable compromise : the Sudan would be formally placed under the Egyptian crown , but actual administration would remain in the hands of the British ( who would lay the groundwork for eventual self-government ) . <P>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
