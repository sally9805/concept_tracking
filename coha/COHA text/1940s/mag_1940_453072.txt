rrann city bakes in an amber coastal I plain , shut off from the world by a horseshoe of mountain to the north , cast , and south , and by an ocean to the westward . The city is not Hamelin , in Brunswick , but Los Angeles , U. S. A. , amid its litter of tributary towns . Two of them , side by side , are Hollywood and Burbank , and between the two , from tho floor of the plain , crops up a mountain made of ultramarine and olive . They call the mountain ' Lookout , ' but it might be the Koppelberg Hill itself . . . . Walt Disney 's new studio , a jewel on the Burbank flat , has no apparent communication with the mountain , which stands so far away that its long afternoon shadows do not temper the 112-degree August heat . But it is near enough so that Mr. Disney could , within five minutes , attain the apron of the ridge , pass by sorcery through the sealed green door , and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pied Piper of our time , perhaps of all time .

' In his suave ' modern ' office Walt wears a pied ensemble consisting of a tasty pair of wine-colored flannel trousers , a loose jacket to match , an oarsman 's shirt of cotton , and moccasins . His eyes are dark , his height is , say , five-ten , his weight one hundred and fifty . This Kansas City newsboy has been charmingthe children of all races and ages out of a melancholy world into a sanctuary-mountain fortified against all attack . But the Pied Piper of Burbank has only just begun . His first studio was in a corner of a garage .

Five years ago the little band of Disney faithful totaled 200 souls ; today the payroll shows 1100 . Until three years ago the studio had never made a long picture ; today 's schedule calls for three features ' and twenty-six shorts ' a year . That promises the final production of a serpent of celluloid 1900 miles long , of which each linear foot will consist of sixteen frames , ' or individual pictures . These individual frames will be photographed from a single color drawing on a sheet of translucent celluloid , or from two , three , four , or five such drawings superimposed upon each other , and held before a fixed and opaque water-color drawing of the background of the scene . Pinocchio , for instance , required over half a million final drawings . And before each final single ? or multiple ? color drawing is ready for the camera it has been preceded by an incalculable number of preliminary sketches ; moulding the characters , the situations , the action , the expression , to their final needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter .

He studied photography in McKinley High in Chicago , and he had always liked to draw . That 's all you need to know to understand the man 's plot . To be sure , when he was turned clown as too young to enlist , he got to France at the wheel of an ambulance , but when he came home be went to drawing again ? catalogue illustrations , and free-lance commercial drawings , and finally cartooning for a company that made comical lantern slides . The problem of animating the action of the characters on successive slides absorbed him . He beguiled a group of cartoonists to collaborate with him in making films of fairy tales ; the group sold the film to a New York company ; the company went broke . Armed with forty dollars , a suit , a sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August of 190 to visit his brother Roy . Roy had a few more dollars of working capital , so the brothers , in a garage , made and photographed enough drawings to add up to a complete short film . Walt took it to the chief Los Angeles motion-picture theatre for a trial projection . The house manager took some urging , but agreed to project it after hours . Disney went into the theatre to watch a regular cartoon 111111 on the bill . Instead , he suddenly saw his own baby projected on the screen . He leapt from his seat , scuttled down the aisle , and announced to the rather frightened audience that the film on the screen was his own . That was his first public showing of the Disney Production . Today that theatre manager is his vice president and sales manager , for Walt has a memory like an elephant , and the loyalty of adhesive plaster . Today the Idaho girl who answered an advertisement for an assistant in the garage is the first and only Mrs. Walt Disney , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic-stripping ' in the American manner is very simple . All you do is to think up a character and then put it through the paces of three or four scenes , in your mind , just as a playwright takes his characters through three or four acts . Then you draw each scene in a simple pen-and-ink technique . If the action turns on words spoken by your characters , you draw a balloon with its string near the speaker and letter the words into the balloon . If your character is a familiar animal , so much the better , for animals are droll ( they look so much like humans ' ) , animals are anonymous , and therefore out of reach of controversial prejudices ( everybody loves animals ' ) , and animals are highly animate . So Walt drew Oswald the Rabbit . The basic method of cartoon animation of which Oswald was a crude example is the basic method of the highly polished product of 1940 . The Oswald saga was popular . Disney wanted to expand , kept trying to prove to his distributor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put up the money . If I can not raise new money , ' reasoned Disney , ' I 'd better raise some new ideas . ' So he simply created Mickey Mouse , just as you would create Niagara Falls , the Tehachapi Mountains , the Panama Canal , or the Hope Diamond . And then , as the silent-screen titles used to say , came sound . Overnight , when the first raw sound began to bark at you from your favorite movie screen , it became evident that you would n't long be interested in watching a silent mouse . Plane Crazy ( Mickey builds a plane , goes on an adventurous flight ' ) was on release to the theatres ; the little one-mouse-power factory was readying Gallop &; Gaucho ( Take-off on Doug Fairbanks . Mickey rescues Minnie from Pete in Spanish locale ' ) ; a third film , Steamboat Willie , as mute as the other two , was ready to go ? when sound ' arrived .

Today , after twelve years , this young man , who shyly professes his ignorance of classical music , has just made a twoand-one-half-hour picture , the body of which is a full-rigged classical orchestral concert by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Symphony , and the dicer of which is a pictorial fantasy on the screen contrived to interpret , animate , enrich , expand , and vitalize the music as music has never before come to life . It is called Fantasia , and it is a revolution . It projects Creation , for instance , with a little help from Stravinsky . Up round Disney 's place it is only a stone 's throw from Steamboat Willie to Leopold Stokowski , Deems Taylor , Ludwig van Beethoven , Johann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice in Steamboat Willie was Walt Disney 's voice , and so it is as Mickey plays the Sorcerer 's Apprentice in Fantasia , and so it has always been and , please God , may always be . II It would help solve international problems if you were to understand the process of making a modern animated cartoon . Having decided upon a story to tell , you talk about it with your associates . If you can not kindle them all with enthusiasm for its graphic possibilities , you choose only those who seem to share your hope . Luckily these people can draw , and in the course of infinite experiment on paper and by voice they evolve a great many ' sequences ' of interesting pictorial action , and they show them to you , and first thing you know you seebefore you tacked on the wall a series of sketches of the dramatic high spots of the story . If it is a pretty long story , too cumbersome for a single group of artists to digest , you choose four or five mon as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story to sketch in further detail ; to another crew you assign the second section . You have thus set twenty or twenty-five seasoned artists off pros- , pecting along a single romantic trail . Each of your four or five crews , or scouting parties , keeps running to you at the head of the file to show you what new treasure it has unearthed . Each of the new sketches you tack in its proper place on a very long wall , and presently all the key pictures of the action of the story are in place before you , the characters are taking on the form of distinct personalities , and the picture has quietly gone into actual production . Article I of the Disney constitution stipulates that every possible element of a picture shall be not a mere pictorial representation of the character or an element of scenery , but an individual , with clearly defined characteristics . Disney lieutenants have grown gray in the service repeating that Mickey is ' not a mouse , but a person . ' So your story crew will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will evolve on paper a character With defined proportions and mannerisms . Before you set about drawing your semifinal story , therefore , you turn your characters over to your Model Department , where they not only make accurate portraits of the characters on paper , as a guide for the animators , but even model the characters in plaster so that they may incite the artists to the feeling of vitality that only a three-dimensional statue can give . You now understand why the shelves , the top of the grand piano in Walt 's office , the top of the master 's desk , and the window ledges hold a ceramic pageant of colored statuettes of kaffir warriors , pygmy pickaninnies , fauns ; a noble portrait bust of Neptune ; a ballet figure in which the coryph6es are not human beings , but hippopotami , ostriches , and crocodiles slightly under the influence of Degas and Helen Hokinson . You now understand why the files of the Model Department arc packed high with photostats of sketch sheets each containing dozens of character notes on each personage in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a baby rabbit. , M-D-B , Snow White ? a character of the utmost triviality in the action of that extravaganza ? and on this sheet arc forty-three sketches of that single obscure rabbit . With the help of the Disney Model Department a left-handed plumber could draw the Durbar and make it human . If it is to be a picture to run ten minutes on the screen , you know that you will ultimately have to show the audience 14,400 pictures . If it is a picture to run one hundred minutes , as a feature picture often does , you need only make 144,000 final drawings . Remember that ( thanks to sound ) your characters may talk , laugh , sing , sigh , grunt , whinny , and quack ; that the t rains you draw may rattle and howl and puff and click , that the teakettle on the hob may whistle . For as you can draw with paint and brush , so you can paint with sound . And remember , too , that just as most music stimulates eye responses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seeing by complementary sounds . So first you make your music . Just compose it to the precise length you want your picture to play , and , on the staff paper you give your musicians to write on , paste the key sketches of your story , at the minute-and-second points at which they should occur . Your musicians will then write the notes . You now have your orchestra rehearse it , to make sure that it really illustrates the picture-story your drawings will presently tell , and when the score is finally shipshape you bid the musicians blow their best for the final and imperishable recording of the music on the margin of a ribbon of film a recording so narrow that to the naked eye the sound track looks like no more than a ruling made with a post-office pen on the wrong kind of paper ? a shaggy line not more than one eighth of an inch wide at its loudest . Since the characters in the story may talk and sing , and since the devices you draw may make characteristic noises , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk animal-talk , before microphones . You have a secret society of sound-effect men who can make a thunderstorm sound , not as a thunderstorm does on a microphone , but as a Thunderstorm With Personality should sound . They will work all afternoon for a proper recording of the word ' Hello . ' They wo n't tell you or anyone else how they achieve their sound effects ; they are jealous as panthers . They will spend several hundred dollars to construct . a three-foot metal fan operated by electricity so that a singer may chirp a ballad into a glass lamp chimney and thence into the whirling fan , in order that his song may be recorded with a certain querulous flutter . They will record all manner of synthetic sounds for you , and by replaying the music track on one phonograph , and the sound-effects track on another , both at once , and by fiddling with dials controlling each , you can blend the music and the talk so that each helps the other and makes a final master sound track . Now some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencils on white paper . Our preliminary key sketch on the wall says that Mickey is wearing a centurion 's helmet . Minnie , a scarf thrown over her shoulder as a Roman maiden , appears before him . He takes off his helmet . It must be a courtly gesture . On the screen it should use , say , the whole of ten seconds . You ought to know that you will need 240 drawings to get Mickey 's helmet off his head and into the crook of his arm , in the approved **35;968;TOOLONG attitude . So one of your lieutenants , known as a head animator , sets out to make the 240 drawings . He makes first , on a sheet of translucent paper , Drawing No , 1 ( Mickey with helmet on head ) . Over Drawing No. 1 he places a fresh sheet of paper , so No. 1 drawing will show through the sheet . He then draws **37;1005;TOOLONG ? the final drawing of the sequence , which is therefore Drawing No. 240 . Next , he draws the action logical at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the ' quarter mile ' ; then he draws the ' three-quarter-post ' action . He assigns each fractional series ( 1 to 00 , 61 to 120 , 121 to 180 , and so on ) to one of four assistants , and from his own start-andfinish guide drawings it is a simple matter for each assistant to produce his own series of final drawings . The 240 sketches are then assembled in sequence , given to the camera department , photographed in black-and-white only , one exposure to each drawing , to make a negative film ten seconds long . If your name is Walt Disney , the animator team who have made this sequence will call your secretary , tell her they have something to show you . She says , I 'll send him in . ' She does . Tho animator threads his ten-second film into a miniature movie projector . You say , ' Let 's see it , ' and the 240 drawings , white-on-black now , and sketchy as can be , appear as motion-picture action on a small ground-glass panel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rest of the task is mercy to do the 240 drawings all over again , in exquisite India-ink penmanship . These final black-and-white drawings will be sent to the inking division . There each will be copied by simple tracing , on a sheet of transparent and colorless celluloid . When the 240 drawings of this ten-second bit have been inspected for microscopic flaws , and passed , they will proceed to the coloring division , where young women of steady hand will apply water colors to the areas on the celluloid . The pigments are made in the Disney laboratory . They are issued to the painters in numbered and sealed and inspected china jars , each containing just enough paint to cover the specific task ? not for parsimony so much as to ensure uniformity and permanence of color tone . The completion of the 240 ' eels ' in color indicates that you 're not far from home with your picture . But if the action has not been well drawn , or ( which is more likely ) if new ideas have darted in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assignment to the animators for resketching . If they go stale on it , the episode may go to a new animator group fresh to the problem . A story can go through miraculously from start to finish in a few weeks , or , which is more likely , it can be postponed for months and years while it is being reshaped . But not one of the two hundred odd films put into production and promised has ever been abandoned . III ' Story conferences ' obviously take place throughout the production of a Disney film , from the first consideration of the narrative to the final ' cols . ' Let 's eavesdrop a random story meet ing which took place on Wednesday , December 14 , 1938 , from 2 to 4.30 P.m. in Music Room No. 1 . The stenographic minutes record that there were present Walt , Ben , Ted , Bill , Paul , Webb , Woolie , Dick , Joe , and Steno . ( Steno signs the minutes on page 8 merely ' irene . ' ) The subject is Sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row , is pinned a sketch , which is the focus of the discussion . WALT . We can get a funny action on that big one ? the Japanese spider-erab . All his legs do n't work the same . Those legs all ought to he working like a piston in an auto . mobile . One is up and the other is down . But it 's got rhythm to it . Not too mechanical . It should be a cycle . The minute you see it , its funny . Jon . I 'd like to see the procession start right off . The anemone should start with a small shot at the feet and come right back . WALT . We should have that first thing , and then a close-up of Pinocchio walking . Cut back ; they all follow . Suggest them following , but do n't show them gathered in the scene . Show them start to gather . He goes through more and more fish . In the close-up he goes by their eyes , and they follow . Then cut to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got the laugh . . . . I think it 's all right . Joe . I wish it was the feet and the rock . I would like to see a continuity of business of him being smart with the lobster and just complete the idea of the rock and the Cricket . WALT . The part where he is riding the sea-horses is a spot I do n't like . It gets a little rowdy . I feel that they have lost their purpose . Cut to Pinocchio ; he begins to float up ; the Cricket is trying to push the sea-horses off him . Leave the Cricket down there push-Mg the sea-horses , . . . You should n't show the fish until the Cricket pulls loose . It 's a surprise . You know how a fish goes along : here comes something and he just opens his mouth and swallows it . Maybe the gill would open up there , and the Cricket comes swimming out . But lie forgot his lust inside , so he puts the cane in there and swims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some remark as he swam away from the , fish . It would have to be a quick thing . I 'm . The thought is ' If it is n't one thing , it 's another ! ' That is how pictures are thought out before they are animated , and while they are being animated . How they over reach the stage of approval for final drawing and coloring is the mystery of Burbank and the despair of Disney 's competitors , and the reason why Disney pictures draw audiences into theatres whether china dishes are being given away or not . After the ' eels ' are colored , the special-effects division seizes them and introduces shadows , and modelings , and predetermined devices altogether too complex to explain here , so that the finished drawing may contain its maximum of depth and harmony . Remember that the action of the character on this ' eel ' may be played , in the final picture , against a second character , or group of characters , and that while you are snaking these 240 pictures of Mickey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eels ' showing Minnie bowing gruciously to Mickey . A final ' scene , ' one twenty-fourth of a second long , may consist , as it reaches the camera , of a ' setup ' of as many as five or six ' eels ' superimposed in a ' eel setup ' upon a fixed background . So your final ten-second series of ' eels ' may really total from 240 to 1200 . They will go to your particular cameraman in the Holy of Holies ? the dust-proof , spy-proof , visitor-proof building which is an orderly catacomb of photographic dens , each the lair of a multiplane camera and its operator . : Each scene will be ' shot ' as a single frame of the endless serpent of Technicolor film which winds out of the Burbank Labyrinth and round and round the earth . But before it issues , remember , it must have a final wiggly pen-ruling traced along its margin ? so the sound track is there recorded , to seal the perfectly timed triple alliance between Music , Sound , and Picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings or as few as you like to depict a given scene , but you can not squeeze or stretch a recorded sound track . That is why you completed the sound first and drew the pictures later to fit the sound . To be sure , you had to have a clear conception at the start , of precisely what music would best fit your story , but if you are Walt Disney , or one of his musical geniuses , that was n't really a problem . Walt has no musical training and perfect musical appreciation . His musical director is a prodigy of musical expertness , and his ear goes to an error in recording as unerringly as a wet spaniel puppy goes to a light and costly Aubusson rug . IV The only extant record of the pictures Walt has made since Steamboat Willie lies here on the desk , and shows that over two hundred shorts and two long features have spun down the twelve years . Let 's transcribe from that record a random outline of the plots of the early shorts , for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures : A battle between Mickey and his mice gang Isle and a bunch of cats Duck revue . Pig sings opera and Mickey sings and dances on piano Mickey as a train engineer Mickey plays organ to skeleton 's dance Mickey at beach ? saves Minnie from drowning Auto gags ? insects and animals steal picnic lunch Covered-wagon type of story ? western locale Mickey as taxi-driver Mickey goes fishing with Pluto Spring cleaning ? gags with Pluto and lawn mower Hunting ? Mickey flying with ducks Burlesque on athletic events . Bicycle race Explorer ? Mickey with the cannibals ? musical ending Mickey operates steam shovel . Minnie sells box lunches . Chase through steel building . Pete in funny riveter gag Mickey as a cellist ? sells Pluto to raise money for poor family ? Christmas And so on . Chivalry , the chase , a fool dog ; gentle , keen , amiable satire of current tastes , of new books , new pictures , new inventions ; sympathetic refraction of the minor ills that beset us all ; heroism , an unwavering confidence in the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wrong , which probably should be called gadgetry  --  these are disclosed by the record as a few of the blocks on which the Disney legend grew at the rate of 16 patient pictures a foot , 5280 feet to the mile . And under it all you hear the roll of a surf of laughter ? the laughter of little children and veryold men and women , the cleansing , tearful , roaring belly-laugh that remains one of civilization 's last claims on immortality . The growth of the Disney project was pretty helter-skelter . From time to time actors who sing or who make other noises appear for an audition at the plant by the Koppelberg hill . Years ago a Chautauqua ventriloquist , imitating animals in the playgrounds of public schools on behalf of a local milk company , came to the studio to offer his services . One of his exclusive specialties , performed by pursing his cheek , and by talking very fast in his throat as if he had a larynx full of hot golf balls , was an imitation of a little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mildly interested , and remarked , ' Sounds like a damn duck . ' A year later , in need of a new character who might serve as salty foil to the gallantry of Mickey , Walt conceived the notion of introducing a hard-boiled , self-reliant , short-tempered and unquenchable duck into a picture called The Wise Little Hen . Where 's that guy that did " Mary 's Little Lamb " like a duck last year ? ' he asked . The ventriloquist 's name popped out of the casting file , and overnight the civilized world surrendered to Donald Duck . Walt forgets nothing except the unimportant , irrelevant , and unpleasant . Ruthless self-criticism , manic ingenuity , and precisionism are the assets no other animated-film team has been able to match . It is trite but true that each new film represented new and hard-earned technical victories and was the best the camp could make , but it was admittedly only a step to the next . picture , which would be better ' or else . ' As color multiplied graphic opportunities , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , ten thousand , interpretations in color . When Mickey 's familiar short pants first appeared in color , what color should they appear in ? Of such grave issues are major crises born in Burbank , for in pictures , as in life , it is dangerous to swap trousers in the middle of a reputation . Wholly aside from the solemn dictum of publicity policy which declares that ' there is no one in the company except Walt , ' there are , as a matter of workaday fact , no surnames on the lot . The day after Deems Taylor started work on Fantasia in an office not far from Walt 's Corridor , he wanted to consult Walt about several little matters . This , ' said he timidly to the operator when he picked up the telephone , ' is Mr. Taylor . Could I speak to Mr. Disney 's secretary , please ? ' ' I 'll call you right back , Deems , ' said the operator ; ' her line is busy now . ' Walt 's secretary presently told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , said Mr. Taylor , he would like to catch a moment of Mr. Disney 's time when he was free . ' Okay , ' she replied ; ' the minute he comes back I 'll send him in . ' An hour later Walt came into the Taylor den , eased himself on to a corner of the Taylor desk , and said , Well , Deems . How 's it going ? Want me ? ' Leopold Stokowski held out for a while , but became Stokie ' to one and all . He even signed his photographs Stold . ' ' " Stokie " would have to leave that e off , ' said Vern , ( Vern hires the 610 artists . ) The telephone rings in the immaculate sweatbox where a film is being run . Janet answers : ' Oh , yeah ?

At the office door of each of the inmates is a small card prettily lettered with the names of the occupants . One cubicle contains a certain two who have been a happy and facile working team for a long time . The card says : ? CARL SMITH VS . BOB JOHNSON Another office is the fortress of five young artists . The card outside reads : ERROL WALTZINORR ERROL SHANAHAN Elam PRIEST &HR.; FLETSCH ERROL PERK/NS On a desk in another office , in the manner of a Big Executive , is a name in 84-point type ; instead of being on a detached fixture , this name is cut from a newspaper , and is pasted on the edge of the desk .

Gertrude Stein has pointed out that familiarity , far from breeding contempt , usually breeds the opposite . Every so often Disney gets tough . When he found out that an undue number of people were arriving too late in the forenoon , and leaving too early , he issued an Ultimatum . With no regard for multi-graphing costs he circulated a Sermon on Tardiness . He pointed out its devitalizing effects . He put himself , as he can not help doing , into the boots of the ten-o'clock scholars , and dramatized the reasons why they had probably been late . He whipped himself up to a first-rate pitch of stern plausibility , approached his grim climax , and rammed home his point by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do your errands before or after work , why not ask your wife to do them ? ' Dreadful punitive measures were implied if Matters were not Corrected . Such drastic measures would probably have taken the form of , say , closing the men 's clubroom , free massage parlor , and squash court for a half day . Punitive measures are not often necessary . One group of animators , envying a brother who was making an early sneak in the afternoon , crossed the wiring of his motorcar so that when he turned on the ignition a series of smart internal explosions , borrowed from the sound-effects department , would ensue , and clouds of black smoke would utter from the louvers . When he slid away from his drawing table about four that afternoon and climbed into his car , a noble bombardment drew every Disney employee on that side of the plant to the windows , cheering .

It is inevitable that several hundred men whose lifework it is to produce humorous catastrophes in picture should try a few out on each other . V The Disney library contains all the durable children 's stories ever told . It also contains five hundred joke books and bound files of the notable humorous publications . It contains a battery of steel filing cabinets which hold a million and a half typed and classified jokes , each legally ascribed to the source from which it was set down . There are 124 classifications of such jokes , and each has from five to twenty subclassifications . A locked case protects first editions of Joe Miller , Alice , and the other important greats in the area of activity of Walt and His Friends .

Some prefer long , limp , loose contrivances like Pluto . To discover in each artist the caprice he best likes to draw , then to harness that specialty , is just one more example of Walt 's determination to use the best available person for every task , even if ho has to make that person the best . One man likes pretty girls , reels them off by the mile , and gets miles of them to reel off ; another thinks they 're stupid .

At noon hour , in the theatre on the lot , a special program of motion pictures runs for thirty min-tiles . It may be a recent release from a live-action studio , an unusual sequence of exploration pictures of the private life of the Kodiak bear , the Florida alligator , the South African dik-dik , or the training of the Arabian saddle horse ; it may be a good corny comedy from the full-life studios over the Koppelberg Hill , or a newsreel of skiing or surf-riding or the explosion of an atom ; it is chosen because it is relevant somewhere to what the studio is currently producing . Your correspondent walks on eggs for fear of accenting one division at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic artist and his business of producing drawings for photography are the function without which there would be no Disney Productions . And yet one of the soberest analysts on the lot , who by virtue of his traffic-control job might be called Head Dispatcher , says that the supreme value of the Disney enterprise lies in the story department , and the supreme value in the story department is a man named Walt Disney . The story department , of course , consists not only of men of words , but of men who can translate words into picture action ? artists who can tell stories as well as storytellers who can draw . For these men , battalioned into t heir four ' units , ' exist the service departments : ( 1 ) the division which ' inks and paints ' ; ( 2 ) the division which adds ' special effects ' to the pictures ; ( 3 ) the division which takes the photographs of the final drawings ; ( 4 ) the division which develops and prints and cuts the film ; ( 5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise ; and ( 6 ) the housekeeping divisions which provide clean air ( no air is used twice , on Walt 's order ) , empty wastebaskets , and look out for fire in corridors . Somebody has made a successful effort not to festoon the place with the lambrequills and trappings of business pomposity . Walt is the president . Roy is the executive vice president . The rest of the official titles you can put in Mickey 's eye . ' We 've made a real effort to cut every possible bit of red tape , ' says the head of the red-tape division . The Chief Red-Tapir keeps lucid and intimate charts of the status of production of each picture . His charts show the number of film feet which the people and their methods , machines , and chemicals are able and expected to produce , and the performance against those quotas , and cousin charts sum up the hopes and deeds of the service divisions . But the Troupe Disney as a whole regards Herb 's charts as the funniest pictorial treasure in the gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Herb himself is a little shy about them . VI Walt is the spark plug of production . No story starts toward a picture until Walt has bought it or invented it , shaped it , tried it out , and given it a push . The General Production unit is therefore responsible to Walt for getting the picture made . The utmost responsibility for efficient use of the myriad special talents thus rests upon the central casting bureau , which : assigns men , squads and companies of men , to the given task which forms a fraction of the whole picture . Through the production pattern of every picture Walt threads in and out like a guiding outline . Having done single-handed , at one time or another , nearly everything that is being done in the studio , and having designed every functional fraction of the plant , Walt knifes into the most minute step of the most microscopic element in an effort to help , help , help . He knows every detail of every process in the place , ' they say . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ' all I want you to use me for is approval . ' To the unending daily encounters with his people he brings not only the stimulus of working with a likable enthusiast , but uncanny accuracy . ' Ile can top a gag like nobody else , ' says one , topping a gag being a certain divine ability to twist and sharpen a point so that its direction and timing pierce the human heart . Strangely , having The Boss bust in does n't make for shoddy politics . ' We have our apple polishers , ' says never-mind-who , ' but with Walt and Roy there is no politics net . ' When a boy or girl who just has n't made the grade is recommended to Walt for dismissal , Walt is more than likely to maintain that the suspect has n't been used right ; often his recommendation for differ ent work for the suspect proves successful , salvages a job . That son of a gun can see good in a person when ninety per cent of the rest of the people ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't buckle walls , as Benchley ( the Reluctant Dragon Benchley ) does . In a rebuke Walt leaves no doubt. : ' You just do n't get the angle , ' he declares . His scoldings are often loud and clear , and then he is contrite and says , ' I was just excited . When I am excited , I get loud . Getting loud when I am excited is just my nature . I just ca n't help it . " We have never found Walt 's judgment lacking , ' his playmates say ; ' would n't we be foolish not to use it all we cant ' The only employee that 's against Walt is the electric elevator , ' they say . The staff voted not to unionize . Among the other reasons why people like to work for Disney is money . The average pay is higher than the average in any other Hollywood studio . ( We are now talking studios , and not star salaries . ) It is a reasonable guess that none but the extreme peaks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a week , and a certainty that the least-paid draw more than is paid for like work elsewhere . The employment mortality rate is strikingly low . Disney needs to spend no nights lying awake worrying about star salaries , for Disney 's stars are in his head , and in his eyes , and in the eyes and minds of 1100 people on the lot , and that saves him a lot of time to dream about new stars at night . Most of the profit the company has made has gone back into the business . The $1,500,000 borrowed to make Snow White was repaid within three months after Snow White reached the screen . But of the elements that make for personal economic security , and relating to money , three systems sustain a high tempo of ambition and provide its outlets . One is a system of rewards for suggestions , which may range all the way from a routine matter of conveying paper from one side of the desk to the other ( the basis of all American office organization ) to a suggestion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suitable for animation . The suggestion system holds open house every working day . And it pays off . The second system bases on the principle of bonuses customarily paid to contractors who complete their work , above standard , under the allotted time . Production units who make a picture better and faster for less than the budget share in the savings they make . The third system is the familiar periodic salary review ' common to enlightened business , except that in the Disney plant it is not periodic but constant : the man set to each task is recorded for his excellence in quality , quantity , and ' savvy , ' and his status is automatically improved . ' There are more jobs to be done perfectly here than there are people to do ' em perfectly , so when they do ' em perfectly they get more dough . ' It works . Why do people work here ? And that means you , ' your correspondent said to a responsible individual in the scheme . He tousled his hair , scowled hard into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , you and I have seen some outfits that had it . They had something . The thing here is like that ? you know , you ca n't help feeling that you 're going to grab that goddam Holy Grail . That sounds terrible . I just ca n't express it exactly . ' ' Where are you going to be ten years from now ? ' was asked of Walt . ' Going along , I guess , ' he replied . Doing the same sort of thing , only I hope it wo n't be ? and I know it will be better . ' Pause . ' Or else , ' he added . What are you doing about the war ? ' was asked of a story man . ' Trying to do our daily job as well as we can , ' he said . When the foreign market was cut off we stepped up production for the countries that have n't gone crazy . If the government comes along and asks us to make propaganda films , okay , we 'll make prop- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one man from Washington been out here , but he was from the Army , and he wanted to see something about the cameras , or something . . . . Look , Gyo , the more I think about that question of whether the music strip for the Fantasia book can run across each two pages in a tint block or a half-tone screen , the less I like the screen idea . Let 's see if we ca n't Let 's see if we ca n't . . . Let 's see if we ca n't build a skyscraper of vitamins . Let 's see if we ca n't have a dogfight of butterflies in the interest of peace on earth . Let 's have a conference of cattails and platypuses and bright new false teeth . Let 's get into an oyster and be a pearl , to dominate the diadem of the beautiful and tender Princess Caroline Elizabeth , who wears a hibiscus over one ear , and who is rescued by a prince named Gus , who is a centaur ? a zebra centaur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princeton-Freshman zebra . Let 's go play badminton in a seven-billion-dollar sound-recording chamber . Let 's , by all means , have a rescue ? and a chase . Let 's have a chase in which St okowski chases Koussevitzky , who chases Barbirolli , who chases President Angell , who chases Einstein , who chases Mickey Mouse . Let 's have a rescue in which Donald sues the Secretary of the Interior for infringement of personality ( Walt will kill this because it is too topical to be clear in Peru , and too political to be decent ) . Let 's see if we ca n't turn music and science and sculpture and painting and writing upside down and shake them out and reassemble the pieces in a fashion which might make people sit still for ten minutes and giggle and weep , instead of bombing schools . If we could only get enough people to do that , multiplied by ten minutes , just think what Herb could do with his charts ! The whole thing is simply a matter of production . The new plant can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
