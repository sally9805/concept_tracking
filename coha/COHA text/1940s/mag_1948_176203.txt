Twelve of the accused had their say before the House Un-American Activities Committee in the Communist espionage investigation last week . When the week was over , the contradiction of stories was greater than ever . <P> Only two of the witnesses admitted that they knew dark-haired Elizabeth Bentley , the self-confessed Communist spy . ( But none admitted knowing that she was a spy . ) Many of the people named by Miss Bentley-either as co-spies or as purveyors of confidential Government information-admitted that they knew each other . Three also said that they had been visitors at a small , red brick house in suburban Chevy Chase . <P> That was the home of Russian-born Nathan Gregory Silvermaster , described by Miss Bentley as the kingpin of one Communist spy ring . There , Miss Bentley had testified , Mrs. Silvermaster and William Ludwig Ullman , an Air Forces major who lived with the Silvermasters , had photographed documents and other data which Miss Bentley carried to her Russian employers . Silvermaster had denied that he was a spy , but he refused to answer other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Powered Tools . Lauchlin Currie , onetime White House assistant , readily admitted that he had been entertained " several times " at Silvermaster 's house . Once he had gone to the basement with Ullman , who showed his powered tools to Mr. Currie 's son . He had seen no photographic equipment , he said . <P> When he took the witness stand , neat , small-shouldered Lauchlin Currie , a straightforward , earnest witness , was accompanied by his friend Dean Acheson , former Under Secretary of State . He made a categorical denial of ever having been a Communist or ever having given inside Government information to anybody not authorized to receive it . <P> He thought there was nothing odd about the fact that he knew several of the people accused by Elizabeth Bentley : George Silverman ( a friend of his Harvard days ) , Victor Perlo , Harry White , Robert Talbot Miller III . Some were economists and he knew " literally hundreds of economists throughout the Government . " One friend of Currie 's who was no economist was Anatoli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentley testified last week that on one occasion Gromov had given her $2,000 for her information . Currie readily admitted knowing Gromov . " I met him at social occasions and was entertained at his house on one occasion . He made no effort to draw me out . The conversation was on cultural matters . " <P> " A Charming Fellow . " When round-faced Harry Dexter White , onetime Assistant Treasury Secretary , took the stand , more flat contradictions went into the record . He said that he did not know Elizabeth Bentley or Whittaker Chambers ( TIME , Aug. 16 ) . As to Chambers ' story that he had pleaded with White to break away from the Communist party line : " Something I would remember very definitely would be if a gentleman met me and tried to convince me not to go into or not to leave a Communist ring . That I would have remembered . That I did not do . "
