For the second time within a year , New York 's Archbishop Francis Joseph Spellman was out in the warring world last week . The flying prelate ( he once held a pilot 's license ) is Military Vicar of all Roman Catholics in the U.S. armed forces . Bent on visiting as many of them as he can , he stopped first in North Africa , then flew on to Italy . He visited the Fifth Army 's General Headquarters just behind the firing line , had lunch with King George VI and Lieut . General Mark W. Clark , offered an afternoon Mass for servicemen . <P> Archbishop Spellman had three audiences with Pope Pius XII . What the Archbishop and his great &; good friend discussed was known only to themselves . But the question of Cardinals for the U.S. may have been mentioned . Since the death of Boston 's William Cardinal O'Connell ( TIME , May 1 ) , the U.S. has had only one Prince of the Church , instead of its normal three or four . He is Philadelphia 's aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sacred College of Cardinals now has only 42 members , the fewest in a century . Full strength is 70 , the number set in 1586 by Pope Sixtus V to commemorate the 70 elders of Moses . But there are always at least half a dozen " vacant hats " so that when a Pope dies his successor may make some immediate appointments . <P> Of prospective U.S. candidates for the red hat , two are virtual certainties : Archbishop Spellman and Chicago 's Archbishop Samuel Alphonsus Stritch . Both , as a matter of fact , may now be Cardinals in petto , i.e. , in the Pope 's breast . <P> <P> * First U.S. Cardinal created ( 1875 ) was New York 's John Cardinal McCloskey . There have been only six others : New York 's Farley and Hayes , Chicago 's Mundelein , Boston 's O'Connell , Philadelphia 's Dougherty , Baltimore 's Gibbons .
