Since our Reception and Information Center opened here in the TIME &; LIFE Building ten months ago , many thousands of TIME subscribers have come calling on us , from as far away even as Liberia and China . <P> Some of you just popped in and out , but many proved leisurely conversationists over the four o'clock tea we serve our visitors . Others have spent hours researching special subjects in the bound volumes of TIME , LIFE and FORTUNE in the reading-room on the balcony , while still others have plied us with questions about TIME and how we gather our news . <P> Our receptionists report that you 're interested in postwar housing ( " We were swamped with inquiries about the Model Home display . Quite a few visitors came back with friends . . . " ) - in war trophies ( " People came in especially to see the Samurai swords and Nazi banners . . . ' ' ) - in museums and picture galleries ( " We 're constantly being asked about special art exhibits around town-and many people have wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis paintings we 're showing currently here in the Center " ) . <P> We try to be prepared to answer as many as possible of your questions by first-hand reports . Information-expert Irene Burbank wore out two pairs of rationed shoes sightseeing every sight around New York herself . For example , she has taken the three-hour boat trip around Manhattan and can even tell you just how much poetic license was involved in describing the seats as " luxury liner deck chairs . " She has also tested on her own palate and nerves the fare and entertainment of just about every eating place and night club in New York . <P> You come to us with some pretty odd requests . Quoting Miss Burbank : <P> " A Chilean wanted to know where and for how much he could get a Russian portable typewriter sent to his sister-in-law in Santiago . We got one for him through the All-Language Typewriter Company , which superimposed the Russian alphabet on a German portable . " <P> " One man wanted ideas on the care &; feeding of goats . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their goat farm in Jersey the next morning at 4 a.m . " <P> As a matter of fact , your wide range of knowledge and interests has had us hopping to keep ahead of your queries - like these : " Can you tell me what former President 's wife was referred to as ' Lemonade Lucy ' ? " ( Ans. : Mrs. James K. Polk ) . . . " Where can I get the only two recordings made by Olga Alvino ? " ( Ans. : They 're on one disk , Victor 22313 , which is no longer in circulation-so you have to prowl among the second-hand music shops . ) . . . " What size is a French 42 woman 's shoe ? ' ' ( Ans. : 10-you always subtract 3 2 from the French measure to get the American size . ) . . . " What is a kangaroo 's pouch lined with ? " ( When we checked the Bronx Zoo on that one we got our ears pinned back with " Skin , of course . What d' ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you we 've met and talked with in these past few months , we reserve a special place in our affections for the young woman who wanted to know if Elizabeth Arden was still giving frequency modulation .
