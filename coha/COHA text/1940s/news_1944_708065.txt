txt President Roosevelt is expected personally to make a decision granting some appeasement from the wage freeze of the Little Steel formula , according to informed Government circles . This is not to say that the National War Labor Board will be a " rubber stamp , " merely announcing the President 's views . The board , as well as Mr. Roosevelt 's closest economic , labor and political advisers , will be consulted and they will offer various " alternatives " to the President . The NWLB will not be the sole judge of the issues in the long standing wage dispute , because the problem is more political or perhaps just as political a question os it is an economic one And in politics the President has the last say . The issue that will soon be on the White House doorstep is not the only one that affects the steel industry and approximately 1,000,000 workers . Steel is a wage and price barometer , and as wages go in steel they will tend to go in other industries . Prices move similarly . milation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reconversion , inflation and deflation , and of various theories relating to the best method of keeping up consumer purchasing power . Thus the decision is so " hot " that only the President can make it . The two big questions which are being asked here as the NWLB steel panel completes a report which will be given out in a few days , are : In what form will labor receive wage " appeasement " ? Will Mr. Roosevelt transmit his decision before or after the November election ? A corollary to the second question is , what would be the effect on the election of a wage-increase announcement ? The answer to the second will depend on how much strength the Administration believes Governor Dewey shows by mid-October . Report Is Coming on Facts In a few days a six-man tripartite NWLB paneL comprising spokesmen for the public , labor and industry , will turn over to the NWLB a voluminous " fact-finding " report . On some subjects the public members will agree with the labor members and on others with the industry representatives . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clues as to how the public members feel about the many demands made on the steel industry last November . The panel was directed not to formulate recommendations ; nevertheless statements of " fact " in themselves may be the equivalent of recommendations . For example , the public members can not avoid commenting on living costs data gathered by the staff of economists headed by Dr. Wesley C. Mitchell of Columbia University . This report , made to Chairman William H. Davis of the NWLB , was that living costs had advanced about 5 per cent beyond the 24.5 per cent estimated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . For the panel to approve the Mitchell estimate as a fact may I thus be interpreted as a sign point-1 ing to the need for a 5-per-cent ' wage- adjustment ' to cover the advance in living costs . Similarly the approval by the public members of other facts would indicate a tendency that would be taken to mean approval of wage concessions to cover these supplemental facts . On the other hand , agreement by the public members with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing of unit costs might mean that these so-called facts would be interpreted as neutralizing possible wage concessions . View of the Steel Industry The steel industry argues that the real facts today respecting the demand for steel and its ability to pay , which might have held good until recently , are due for a change owing to the imminence of victory for the Allied armies . Thus , it is maintained , the case presented by the United Steel Workers , CIO , is " semi-academic , " in view of rapidly changing conditions and early cutbacks . The economists of industry assert that ability to pay up to the present and ability to pay in the future are different . Because of the industry 's vast capitalization and its large overhead , the labor cost per unit , it is said , will rise as production declines . Some Administration economists , however , insist that as the industry is relieved of punitive overtime payments and as it begins to downgrade employes , large savings will be realized and these might well be applied to adjustments on straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has greatly increased its efifciency during the war and that this efficiency will be carried over ' and apply after peace conditions rule . These economists favor a wage increase so that consumer purchasing power may be sustained to enable the steel workers and others to buy back the products they manufacture . For Fewer Hours , Pay Rise One idea under discussion in Administration circles is to increase the straight time hourly rate of the steel industry as hours decrease from forty-eight to forty . Thus , if the average hourly rate , including overtime , is $1.14 , or $54.72 for a forty-eight hour week , it is proposed to increase hourly wage rates somewhat to make up for the loss sustained by the decrease in working time . How much of an hourly adjustment might be made if the pro13osal was adopted can not be fore , cast . The steel workers ' union would like to have the same pay for forty hours of work as for forty-eight , or about $1.36 an hour.i Another plan discussed is to make the wage adjustment about 8 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $1.04 . This would be intended to cover somewhat the loss due to abolition of overtime . The new rate then would be $1.12 1-3 an hour , making the weekly take home pay , based on a forty-hour week , $44.92.
