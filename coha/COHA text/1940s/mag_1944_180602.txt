The sixth , and critical , winter of war settled upon Europe with chilling rains , hunger and uncertainty . It was different from any winter since 1939 , for the focus of despair had shifted from German-occupied countries to Germany . But retreating Nazis left chaotic disruption , vital shortages , and something more portentous . Liberated Europe was like a sea bottom from which the ebbing of a foul tide had exposed strange , unfamiliar , disturbing forms-the forces of the social war of which World War II was a military expression . <P> Round 1 . In Western Europe liberation had been a joyful binge . Now Europe had a hangover . In Brussels , as in Paris , there was still an afterglow of liberation gaiety-but it was forced . Belgians needed food , clothing , fuel . Transport was paralyzed . This week the Allied High Command began diverting 200 tons of food daily for 20 days , to help meet Belgian needs . It would bolster , it might save Premier Hubert Pierlot 's Government . But in Belgium , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Belgian Communists sternly charged Pierlot 's Government with inefficiency . Said London 's New Statesman and Nation : " This is the opening round in the struggle between new revolutionary forces ... and groups wishing to return to prewar politics and economy . " <P> In the liberated Netherlands too there was distress . Citizens were rationed to 1,040 calories of food daily , less than half enough . Schools were closed . Hospitals were critically short of personnel and medicines . To Queen Wilhelmina 's Government in London a Dutch underground leader reported : Communism had gained no converts in Holland but old conservative parties were being radicalized . From Dutchmen in Holland , Dutchmen in exile did not know what to expect . <P> Disciplined Britain . Similar conditions bred similar forces in Poland , Greece , Yugoslavia , Italy . The sixth winter of war was hard on Britain , too . In London , thousands still slept in shelters and subways because they had no homes , while 100,000 workers from all Britain rushed repairs on 800,000 bomb-damaged houses . In Parliament , Tories demanded greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've got to the stage where Londoners are asking why the devil they should go on taking it . " <P> Tightly rationed Britons were promised special food bonuses-during Christmas week each person would receive an extra half-pound of meat , sugar , margarine . <P> Britain 's hardship was organized , disciplined . For themselves , Britons saw no prospect of a violent swing in any direction . But Britons themselves knew that what happened in continental Europe would one day affect Britain . Said the News Chronicle 's editor Gerald Barry : This has become the common man 's war . Man is trying to find the equation between individual liberty and economic order . Communal control . . . without too great a sacrifice of personal freedom seems to be the common denominator of all resistance movements .
