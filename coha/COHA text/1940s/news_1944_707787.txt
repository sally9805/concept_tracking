txt Prayer for Invasion Day We all know that a great crisis confronts us . Corregidor , Guadalcanal , Tarawa and all the noble deeds of fighting American men will crystallize on invasion day . In the period of a few days or weeks will be centered all the efforts and love of Americans for their country and their willingness to die for each other . Let us set aside one evening on which all of us shall for a few moments pause in our occupations and bow our heads in prayer for our country and for these men we love . I suggest that this be done at 9 o'clock some time within the next ten days , that we do this together at a signal , perhaps by a five-minute ringing of our church bells . Let us say , " Good luck , Americans , and God be with you till we meet again . " STOWE WILDER . Portsmouth , N. H. , May 5 , 1944.                  @ @ @
