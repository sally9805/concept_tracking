Every day during the trial of Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty ( TIME , Feb. 14 et seq. ) , a dapper , trimly uniformed officer , with a slightly dreamy look in his eyes and spotless white gloves on his hands , sat at the defendant 's right . Every day as the session opened , the officer stopped before the judges ' bench and formally reported that the accused was present in the court . Last week , Lieutenant of Prison Guards Imre Szipzr , 32 , warden of the Marko Street House of Detention in Budapest , was himself in the prisoner 's dock before a Budapest criminal court . He was under charges , together with six subordinates , of having accepted bribes from relatives of prisoners under his charge . <P> There were , moreover , aggravating circumstances . " Lieutenant Szipzr , " said the court , " impaired the reputation of the country 's first house of detention by being responsible for the bad spirit which prevailed in the prison for a certain period . " As usual , the Communists were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an excess of high spirits . <P> Szipzr , who had it tough during the war ( he spent several years in a Nazi concentration camp ) , seemed determined to make up for lost time . Attractive wives and daughters of prisoners often came to him to ask for special treatment of their relatives ; the lieutenant , who appreciates feminine charms , usually granted these favors-in return for considerations . <P> Szipzr would not deny his prisoners the advantages which he himself enjoyed . For fat fees he would provide bored , wealthy prisoners with women visitors , who frequently stayed overnight in the cells . There were nights when the corridors of the Marko Street House of Detention sounded just like one of Budapest 's livelier nightspots . Drinks were sold by Szipzr and his assistants , and only the gypsy band was missing . <P> The court last week sentenced Lieutenant Szipzr to loss of his office and four years in prison . He would have a duller time than his former charges .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
