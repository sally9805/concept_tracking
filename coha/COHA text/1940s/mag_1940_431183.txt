 | Codes , Collusion and Housing Costs Condensed from The American Mercury Karl Detzer JOHN BROWN , a middle-income citizen with a middle-sized family , wants to build a house . He pays double the rent he can afford . Like 52 percent of Americans , his wages entitle him to buy a $2000 to $4000 dwelling . But John Brown might as well know now that he can not build such a home unless selfish minorities using criminal tactics are first driven from the building field . Enough John Browns can drive them out . Their weapon is resolute and intelligent cooperation . They can repeal bad building laws , bring antiquated laws up to date , and enforce good laws , for the building rackets operate in a jungle of lawlessness . Through collusion , boycotts , strikes and politics , labor leaders and businessmen work to prevent John Brown from getting his house cheaply . Dealers and manufacturers want to prevent the upset of their markets ; unions want to prevent the use of timesaving devices . One racket raises building costs by fixing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " understanding " with union labor . Another prevents outside competitors from entering a loco field . One potent means of keeping costs up is sly manipulation of local building codes . There are 1800 such codes in the United States . The are merely local ordinances , subject to repeal or revision whenever enough citizens in any town demand it their elected city council . All these codes were nobly conceived to prevent fire traps , disease traps , overcrowding , and unsafe construction by the jerry-builder But many of them , today , stand in the way of inexpensive , safe housing . One community outlaws plumbing or wiring methods which a neighboring city insists upon ? both in the name of safety . One demands nine-foot minimum ceiling height ! when another permits eight-foot ceilings . Many such discrepancies keep building costs high by preventing mass production of standard parts . Often the codes are used to prevent prefabrication , to outlaw inexpensive wallboard in favor of costly plaster , to multiply the feet of pipe used in plumbing and the  | hours required to install it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , to give preference to the products of one manufacturer over another . More than 65 percent of codes allow local plumbing , building , roofing and electrical inspectors to decide what are safe and suitable materials . Inspectors have an eye on their own interests . For example , the plumbing inspector is usually either a master plumber or a union member , interested in keeping plumbing costs high . Often he works hand in glove with both local unions and national distributors . The 5o makers of prefabricated houses have met ruthless opposition from lumber and supply dealers and unions who see in the assemblyline house a menace to wasteful , outworn methods . Gunnison Housing Corporation , largest of prefabricators , recently sold several factory-built houses in Springfield , Ill . Architecturally and structurally they were better than most houses . But the Springfield council quickly amended its code , and prevented erection of these homes . Chicago struggled for 15 years to throw off an antiquated code , until finally a committee of experts forced the adoption of a model law . But the city council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One rider outlawed plaster wallboard by specifying that it must be thicker than any on the market , another prevented the use of pressedwood panels unless covered by plaster . For 20 years the Chicago code required that electric refrigerators be connected to sewers , to carry off theoretical water from theoretical melting ice ! Family-sized refrigerators now are exempt , but larger refrigerators ? in boardinghouses , for example ? still must comply . Federal courts have indicted 1580 unions , contractors , dealers , and material supply sources in a dozen states for criminal practices which keep building costs high . The Mason Contractors Association of Washington , D. C. , conniving with officers of bricklayers ' , plasterers ' and masons ' unions , agreed secretly in 1938 that members must submit all bids before filing to a " bid administrator . " He averaged the bids and struck a figure 7 1/2 percent below that average . That became low bid . The unions made it hard for contractors who would n't play ball . A federal court last March ordered this association disbanded . A Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' union allowed members to work only for contractors who belonged to a Voluntary Code Authority . Those contractors did 95 percent of the work in the city . According to the indictment the union then set up the United Heating Company ; whenever it looked as if a nonmember of the Code Authority might get a job , this union company bid even lower , on an unprofof such practices , the Department resolute attack . The place to start of , Justice will be interested and is your home town . helpful . Whatever the remedy , the first step must be taken by the citizen himself ? by Americans everywhere who want and need better houses at prices they can afford to pay . It takes organization , perseverance , a  | itable basis . In hundreds of town ; similar agreements and conspiracies exist . Unions and dealers in one city frequently combine to boycott products made in another . Members of Local 3 , Electricians ' Union of New York , make practically all electric installations in and near New York and do most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if a builder used fixtures not made in New York , this union would tear out all the wiring in the fixtures , then slowly and expensively put it back . Officers of several companies making window sash , and four glaziers ' unions , have been indicted for excluding competitors and boosting the price of windows in every new house in Cleveland . It is also charged that sash had to be delivered without glass and glazed on the job ? the expensive way . Indictments in Chicago , Detroit , Pittsburgh , San Francisco , Seattle and on Long Island charge collusion in one form or another to keep up building prices . These combines are so powerful that the government itself is not immune to pressure . The U. S. Housing Authority , harassed by the plasterers ' union , issued an order on February 4 , 1939 , never to use plaster substitutes except when " it is conclusively shown that use of plaster will substantially increase costs . " Jurisdictional disputes between unions further complicate building . At Centralia , Ill. , A.F. of L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Orleans , A.F. of L. carpenters quit jobs to which CIO teamsters hauled materials . Nearly everywhere it 's the same story ; and everywhere these evils can be corrected if all the John Browns set out stoutheartedly to stop it . Manipulation of building codes should be simple to halt . A city council acts quickly if any considerable group of voters militantly ' demands its rights . Here is an opportunity for women 's clubs everywhere . Such groups , aided by local newspapers , can rapidly smoke out obsolete or unfair clauses in their code . It probably is necessary that plumbers inspect plumbing , electricians inspect electrical equipment , men experienced in building trades check other construction ; but these men could be made to function under a code authority composed of laymen deeply inter-ested in protecting the public . In most towns an able committee could be mobilized which would serve without salary . The Bureau of Standards in Washington makes , exhaustive tests of all materials and methods , and can give any community the data it needs to write a safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if John Brown and his neighbors discover evidence  | of such practices , the Department of Justice will be interested and helpful . Whatever the remedy , the first step must be taken by the citizen himself by Americans everywhere who want and need better houses at prices they can afford to pay . It takes organization , perseverance , a resolute attack . The place to start is your home town .
