txt BERLIN , Aug. ** Third Reich 's fight to the finish against Britain was said in authoritative German quarters today to have entered the stage of decisive action . Any curbing of the German air attacks that might have been occasioned by bad weather , it was asserted , was now done with , and a rapid acceleration of the new phase of the war that had been initiated Saturday might he expected . Be that as it may , the Germans were reticent as to just what happened today . The only information they had given out by late evening was that in the course of the day 's fighting thirty-nine British planes had been shot down and ten German planes were lost . The day 's raids were reported made over Southeastern England in the Kentish region . Evidence that the war had now entered the decisive stage , the Germans said , was contained in the wording of yesterday 's and today 's : ommuniqu ? s by the High Command .

" Last week , the German military // FULL ATTACK BEGUN IN AIR , REICH SAYS // circles sought to emphasize , the " armed reconnaissance " did not represent a concentrated effort systematically to destroy militarily vital enemy objectives . Such effort , they added , began Saturday ; and intensification of it was confidently predicted here for the immediate future . When the High Command mentioned that portions of Air Fleets 2 and 3 participated in yesterday 's raids on the British , it was stated , that indicated only that a relatively small number  --  although there may well have been several hundred planes participating in the actions ? of units of the German Air Force had yet been employed against Britain .

The objective of the " first phase " of aerial activity against the enemy , it was said here , was to gain mastery of the air over Britain . That had now been accomplished , the Germans declared , and the second phase , which involved the systematic destruction of things vital to British defense was under way . What the next phase might be was anybody 's guess . The Germans continue to assert that the British are going to experience a tremendous surprise . Authoritative quarters here maintain an attitude of complete confidence that the British are going to be beaten at home ? and very soon .
