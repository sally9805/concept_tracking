It was not exactly love but mutual interests that drew W. R. Grace &; Co. and Pan American Airways Corp . together . Grace wanted a better way to get South American wealth from the jungles to its ships on the coast ; ambitious Pan Am saw much to be gained through Grace 's contacts and capital . Result : Pan American-Grace Airways , organized in 1928 Panagra took on the job of flying the western coast of South America to Buenos Aires For a while Grace steamshippers and Pan Am airmen were happy together . But trouble soon developed between Panagra and one of its parents . Pan Am , the new line discovered , had quietly set up a route of its own from the eastern coast to the U.S. : it became Panagra 's only link to its rich U.S. customers . <P> Worse yet , as time went on Pan Am showed no intention of giving Panagra any advantages . On the other hand Grace was all for pushing Panagra into the highest circles , no matter what it meant to Pan Am 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family quarrel the like of which the neighborhood had never seen or heard . The disturbance became so noisy that Grace finally ran for the cops , i.e. the Civil Aeronautics Board But CAB decided that the case really was not under its jurisdiction , and left them to fight it out . <P> Last week , after years of squabbling , the family kissed &; made up . In a spirit of sweet accord , Pan Am and Grace jointly announced a 99-year agreement under which Panagra will offer direct daily through service from the U.S. to South America , with Panagra planes and crews flying over Pan Am 's routes from Miami and New Orleans to the Canal Zone and going on from there as usual . All that is needed now is the official blessing of CAB , which has already nodded approval .
