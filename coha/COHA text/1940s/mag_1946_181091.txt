Even people in Boston-even Lowells and Cabots-admit the existence of sex . Said Mrs. Hugh Cabot Jr . last week : " I 've been interested for a long , long time in this whole subject . " Mrs. Cabot 's interesting remark was heard by listeners to station WEEI . She and Dr. W. Linwood Chase , director of the Massachusetts Society for Social Hygiene , thereupon went on to discuss sex education for children . <P> Each Monday during the summer , Dr. Chase and some prominent Boston women will tackle the same subject . Sponsored by the Greater Boston Community Fund , the program is aired at a time usually devoted to children 's shows ( 5:30 p.m . E.D.S.T. ) . The first discussion urged parents to answer their children 's questions honestly , to provide early sex education without fairy tales . Some future topics : " Questions Children Ask and Do n't Ask " ; " Puppy Love : Dating Dos and Don'ts . "                  @ @ @
