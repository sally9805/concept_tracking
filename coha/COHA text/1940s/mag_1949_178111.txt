Communist China and Communist Russia confronted the non-Communist world with a sharp , significant display of comradely teamwork . <P> In Peiping , the Communist " People 's " Conference last week put the finishing licks on its " People 's " Republic ( TIME , Oct. 3 ) . By unanimous vote , the hand-picked delegates chose Party Boss Mao Tse-tung as the Republic 's chairman . Beneath him they put six vice chairmen . Half represented non-Communist window-dressing : Madame Sun Yatsen , fellow-traveling widow of the great Nationalist revolutionary ; Marshal Li Chi-shen , leader of dissident Nationalists ; and Chang Lan , septuagenarian chief of the Democratic League . The remainder were top-level Communists : Liu Shao-chi , Politburo theoretician second only to Mao ; Chu Teh , aging commander in chief of the Red army ; and Kao Kang , pro-Russian boss of the Manchurian " People 's " Government . The dual post of Premier and Foreign Minister went to smooth-talking Chou Enlai , the party 's ace public-relations man with foreigners . <P> The new government got a new flag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , symbolizing Communist Party leadership , and four smaller yellow stars , symbolizing workers , farmers , petty bourgeoisie and national capitalists . Chairman Mao proclaimed : " This government is willing to establish diplomatic relations with any foreign government . . . " <P> The New York Times had called the Peiping conference the " nauseous force " of a " compact little oligarchy dominated by Moscow 's nominees . " But the Moscow press hailed it as one of the year 's two " stupendous events " - the other being Russia 's explosion of an atomic bomb . <P> That night most of Moscow 's foreign diplomatic colony gathered at Spasso House , the home of U.S. Ambassador Alan Kirk . They were watching a movie , when big news arrived . Within hours of Mao Tse-tung 's bid , Joseph Stalin 's government had granted recognition to the Chinese Communist government . In a brusque note to Canton , Moscow had brushed off the Nationalist as " a provincial government " and withdrawn its recognition . <P> In Peiping , Mao ordered ten days of celebration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete with 14 planes of the new Chinese Red Air Force . In Shanghai , schoolgirls marched , gongs and cymbals sounded , giant Red stars appeared everywhere under the new gold-starred flag of the " People 's " Republic . <P> The governments of the Western diplomats gathered at Moscow 's Spasso House had not arrived at any clear , coordinated policy on whether to recognize Red China . The U.S. was still waiting " for the dust to settle . "
