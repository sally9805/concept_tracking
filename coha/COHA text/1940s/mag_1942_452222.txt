WTIIEN the Laclede Rangers arrived at Fort W Leavenworth , it was too late in the day for them to be mustered in . Colonel Kearny invited the officers to dine with him , but could not entertain the whole outfit ? and army regulations forbade the feeding of civilians . As heroes , they were willing to die in the Halls of Montezuma but they wanted to live to get there . So the officers , returning from an excellent dinner , found their command preparing to take the post apart . Fast thinking was called for , and Captain Hudson , the lawyer who had raised the company , made an oration . He waved not only the flag of freedom but the silk guidon stitched by fair fingers in the homeland , and the Rangers cheered . " Yes , " he bellowed , " we shall knock at the gates of Santa Fe as Ethan Allen knocked at the gates of Ticonderoga , and to the question Who 's there ? ' we shall reply , ' Open these gates in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tumultuous applause . The captain soared on : " But suppose the fellows inside should call out , ' Are you the same Laclede Rangers who went whining round Fort Leavenworth in search of a supper ?

ItennAnn DEVoTo grew up in Ogden , Utah , at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains , surrounded , as lie says , " by Mormon pioneers and other veterans of the West , miners , bullwhackers , cowboys , desert runners , prospectors , Indian fighters .

Ile camped and fished in the mountains , worked on a ranch Through which ran ruts of the California Trail , and wrote his first piece about the Diggers while he was still in high school . he began his systematic study of the Southwest after the Armistice , and from that tune to this the Oregon Trail , the Mormon migration , the annexation of Texas , the Donner party , and the deeds of the mountain men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is what Manifest Destiny meant to us . This gives the tone of the Army of the West . It was the damnedest army . It could do nothing well except march and fight , and would not do those by the book . For a while , till they learned to respect the unalterable , the West Pointers who had to oversee it would willingly have murdered most of its components . They were volunteers , they were farmers mostly , they were incredibly young , they were Missourians and frontiersmen . All good armies grouch ; probably none has ever bellyached so continuously as this one . They groused about their officers , their equipment , the food , the service regulations , the climate , the trail , the future . They would accept direction or command no more easily here than at home , and were always assaulting their noncoms , on the grounds that Joe 's stripes could not neutralize his native stupidity and did not sanction him to put on airs . They howled derision of the officers whenever it was safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inure inflexible of them , and when a vacancy occurred resolved to elect no one except from the rank of private . They abominated neatness , they hated the routine of guard duty and the care of horses , they straggled worse than any ( it her fighting troops in history . Till the army was concentrated at Bent 's Fort , its component parts were just where whim took them  --  a battalion strung out for five miles while the individual soldier wasted ammunition on imaginary antelope ; or three-quarters of the army marching in a clump with the guard just to see what the country was like . They were extremely uncomfortable until they leaved the mechanics of soldiering . Their equipment was incomplete and faulty . Boots did n't fit and blisters burned one 's heels but were no worse than the sores made by pack straps . Saddles were rudimentary , made running sores on the horses ' backs , and seemed designed to split the rider lengthwise . The first few days saw the only rain they would encounter till they reached the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylong drenching , water-soaked blankets , cold food , and muddy underd rimers . The West Pointers fell back on the simple assumption of all military life , that though soldiers may be fighting men they are also children . Issued a day 's rations at dawn , they would eat it all for breakfast , grouching about having to do their own cooking , or throw away what they could not cat and then , at night , curse God , Polk , Kearny , and Doniphan , who required patriots to go supperless . Some would replace the water in their canteens with whiskey , sip it through torrid hours , and have to ride retching in the wagons . Or they would drink bad water till their bellies swelled , and have to crawl into the grass and lie foundered for hours . They knew the management of horses on farms but resented the cavalryman 's subjection to the well-being of his mount , and took such wretched care of theirs that the officers had to hold classes of instruction . Kearny anticipated that , coupled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him an army of infantry from Santa Fe on . However , he had a job to do and he drove them hard . He was fortunate in having Doniphan , colonel by suffrage of free electors , a drawling uncle to farm boys who were far from home . Doniphan was seldom or never in uniform , unfenced by discipline , always approachable , forever calling privates Jim or Charlie , a master of impromptu exhortation . The boys looked at the Colonel , lounging his huge frame beside some poker game or amiably explaining that Joe had to go on guard tonight because Elmer had done his stint last night , and did n't yield to that phantasy of chopping up a West Pointer . They dug in and marched . Fifteen miles was a standard clay 's travel on the prairies but it was too slow going for Kearny . He demanded twenty miles a clay , twenty-five , twenty-eight , thirty , sometimes thirty-two . The troops wailed but took it ? took it , in fact , better than the horses , which weakened on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . And the infantry took it best of all . Companies A and B customarily forged ahead of the cavalry they were attached to and , though they cursed the inhumanity of their officers , took pride in their mileage . Their lips parched in the prairie wind , the sun nauseated them , the wagons and ambulances were always picking up some who had not stood the pace , they were sure that Kearny was a tyrant , but they made camp some hours before the cavalry and turned out to boo them in great content when the tired beasts sagged in at twilight . The legs of the men swelled at the shin with a queer distemper , which turned out to be periostitis , the common splint they were accustomed to treat in plow horses . There were rattlesnakes by the hundred , killed on the march , buzzing from beside the buffalo chips the soldiers stooped to pick up , slithering into their blankets at night . There were the mosquitoes , much deadlier than the snakes . There were swarms of buffalo gnats to choke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses . The country began to break out in patches of " saline incrustation , " alkali . Like the emigrants to the northward , the army drank corrosive water and got violently physicked . And not only by alkali ; the curse of armies , dysentery , had begun to flourish . Nor was the scummy standing water of the buffalo wallows any better for them , when it was all they got to drink at nooning , crawling with infusoria and noisome with buffalo urine , The less fit began to break . As the trains fell farther behind and rations shortened , scurvy appeared . Measles traveled with them . The wagons filled with sick ; some of them died . A grave had to be dug at Pawnee Rock ; and from there on , burial parties were no novelty . They had come for a patriotic summer while the eagle screamed , but for some of them the great adventure was ending in a short agony and a shallow grave filled with such stones as could be gathered to keep the wolves away . 27 Grouchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend . There was water in the river , which was by no means a constant condition . In these parts it is a muddy and rather odorous stream which runs in trickles through a wide bottom choked with cottonwoods and brush . Farther west it narrows to a more certain bed , like the Platte , and as it gets nearer the mountains has more water in it . The trail followed its general direction , touching its crazy course at the nodes , and the freighters were accustomed to camp on certain timbered islands as a defense against the Indians . The country grew more severe now , the scale infinitely extended , the swell longer and the pitch steeper , the wind stronger , the sun hotter , the dust more inexhaustible , water scarcer and less drinkable . If there was little water , there were millions of flowers ; if the steady wind blistered their faces and sudden torrid gusts sandblasted them with alkali , the infinitely blue sky produced cloud effects the most magnificent . They trudged through prairie-dog towns a mile wide , jackrabbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were full of wolves . The horses grew weaker but the men slowly toughened . Kearny watched them and applied more pressure . They howled and lustily hated all officers , so much so that accusations of malingering and inefficiency now circulated about even the venerated Doniphan . The oldest trail went to Bent 's Fort and thence south over Raton Pass . The army kept to the Arkansas in true desert , sandy , sparsely vegetated , beginning to break up into foothills , but supplied with drinking water of a sort at safe intervals . They crossed the Cimarron River at Chouteau 's Island and , since it was here the international boundary , became an army of invasion at last , though they would cross again to American soil before they reached Bent 's Fort . Inconceivably , the weather got hotter still , but one day a storm passed near enough to cool the air . The nights were always cold , campfires were just buffalo chips , and rations were slim and had . Then the unpredictable country got green for a space and even produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Timbers , a substantial belt of them . Then more desert , inure siroccos ? and then the infantry came over an incline to a flat stretch , and on the western horizon thin , dark , cloudlike masses were suddenly recognizable as a culminating wonder , the Rocky Mountains . The doughboys yelled in delight and suddenly realized that they had come a long way from Missouri . A hell of a long way ! They took up the march across a last stretch of parched sand and sagebrush and sometime before noon saw the walls of Bent 's Fort rising from the plain . Two miles from it they reached Moore 's detachment camped by the river , made their own camp , and started to dig a well . It was July 18 and the infantry had beaten everyone except the advance guard to the rendezvous . Five hundred and thirty miles out from Independence , on the north bank of the Arkansas again , they had reached the first permanent settlement in what is now Colorado , Bent 's Old Fort or Fort William , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the American Fur Company 's headquarters at the mouth of the Yellowstone , Bent 's was the largest of all the trading posts , and it had perhaps the most varied and adventurous history . Its thick adobe walls made a rectangle a hundred by a hundred and fifty feet , inclosing a central patio ; two of them were two stories high , and there was a walled corral beyond . It was a complete factory for the Indian trade ? warehouses , smithy , wagon shop , storerooms ? and it had dormitories and such incredibilities as a billiard table and an icehouse . Many mountain men wintered among its comforts ; usually at least one village of Indians was camped by the river , three hundred yards away . They were usually Southern Cheyenne , whose trade the firm monopolized , but might be Arapaho or Ute or even Kiowa or Comanche . The post 's daily life was an adventure story , and the yarns it heard are our lost history . 28 The army of invasion moved out from Bent 's Fort on August 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its organization , had left about seventy-five on sick call to rejoin him at Santa Fe or be carted back to Fort Leavenworth , and had clamped down such discipline as was at all possible . The traders followed , practically all of this year 's trains to Santa Fe . Army and traders , it was a formidable caravan . One census makes it 1550 wagons and nearly 20,000 stock all told , oxen , beeves , horses , mules . A long column moving through the most intense heat yet encountered and the worst desert of the trail . Lieutenant Emory 's thermometers showed 1200 and the sirocco never died across the sand . The troops ' ied handkerchiefs over their mouths , to no avail . They got nosebleeds from the altitude and dysentery from the alkali . They could not be controlled at water holes , where the first ones spoiled the drinking for the rest . The horses were even worse ; Captain Johnston observed that when the water was scarcest they were most apt to urinate in it . Private Marcellus Edwards of Doniphan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 4 that it was " so bad that one who drank it would have to shut both eyes and hold his breath until the nauseating dose was swallowed . " All this time they were angling toward the mountains ; the Spanish Peaks grew higher every mile and the main range of the Rockies stretched its abrupt bastion out of sight , north and south . At last they struck the Purgatoire near the present site of Trinidad , Colorado , and it proved to be a stream out of paradise , swift , cold , poetically timbered . They drank till all were surfeited and some vomited ; they bathed , they washed their clothes . One of them went mad , several died from the now ended strain , but game was shot , some supplies caught up , and beef could be butchered . The next night the campfires slanted upward at a steep pitch : they were in the Raton Pass . Here was the first place where an alert enemy could have destroyed them , but in spite of the daily rumors no enemy appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fun of it . Raton Pass is a long , twisting , arduous grade and they did better with it than the horses , which were now punch-drunk . They reached the top and looked out on one of the continent 's great views , all New Mexico spread out below in the molten gold of southwestern sun . They clambered down the other side and found that the molten gold was hot . Now the scouts were bringing in various Mexicans . Spies probably , and Kearny sent them home to report that he was irresistible . They had proclamations by Armijo and others , the usual proclamations , and they brought notice of trouble ahead . Two thousand troops were assembling to oppose the invasion , then five thousand , eight thousand , twelve thousand . Kearny closed up his intervals , posted scouts , and kept on . At the Mora they found another beautiful campground and the first settlement since Fort Leavenworth , a half-dozen adobe huts and " a pretty Mexican woman with clean white stockings , who very cordially shook hands with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more huts , where the streams made a green thread across burned plains , and the Doniphesias could buy mutton , corn , vegetables . They could also feel a hearty Protestant contempt for pop ? ish superstitions and , gaping at the Mexicans , marvel at the extremity of poverty , dirt , obsequiousness , and desire to please the conquerors . The daily captives told conflicting stories . Either there were no preparations to resist or the whole province had risen . Americans from Santa Fe came in and the best thought was that Armijo would fight at Apache Canyon , fifteen miles from the city . Las Vegas was the largest village they had seen so far . They bought some sheep , scorched their palates with the native stews , and stole some corn for themselves and their horses . Kearny promptly won the villagers by promising to pay for the corn , which was not the custom of any other troops who had ever passed this way . There was a growing murmur : some of the Missourians were remembering that the Texas Expedition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Las Vegas and that at San Miguel , a few miles farther on , General Salazar had shot some of the prisoners . That night word came that a Mexican force had reached that same canyon and was fortifying it . Word of the expected battle went far back on the trail and Captain Weightman of the artillery , coming up after convalescing at Bent 's Fort , rode all night to take part in it . He reached the army at reveille and Major Swords was with him , the quartermaster , bringing Kearny 's commission as brigadier general . Kearny made combat dispositions , spare ammunition was issued ; some of Doniphan 's officers reminded their men that , on General Taylor 's word , Missouri volunteers had not distinguished themselves at the battle of Okechobee , so maybe they had better wipe out that stain . Keyed up , the army marched through town and halted while Kearny , from a roof top , announced to the villagers that they were now Americans . He did it skillfully , reminding them of the oppressions they had suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assuring them that the United States would defend them against the Indians as in two centuries no one ever had . There is no record of what they felt , a humble folk whose entire history had been misery , paupered by all governments , preyed on by brigands , and called by the Apache the mere herders who raised stock for them . They knew no way of life that was not constant oppression and intermittent massacre . Probably the promise of protection from Indians warmed them a little , though it was not to he kept for half a century . Probably also they cared no more than anyone else to acknowledge another conqueror . However , much experience of conquest had taught them that courtesy was best , They smiled , bowed , cheered , gave fruits and wines to the guards , and took the meaningless forced oath of allegiance in the best of humor . The first formal occupation made , Kearny prepared to drive the enemy out of the narrow canyon that today bears his name . He sent the infantry , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothills to the right . He formed the rest of the Doniphesias and the artillery behind the Dragoons , took his place at the head of his old regiment , pushed out a cavalry point , and ordered the army forward . The Dragoons trotted , then broke into a gallop . There was a shine of sabers in the sunlight , the pound of hoofs and the long lift of the charge ? and the guidons were fluttering in the empty pass . No enemy , just another rumor , and the army rejoiced in its first battle . The next day Kearny swore in another , larger town , San Miguel , and among the day 's pickups was the son of the General Salazar who had slaughtered the Texans . On the following day they passed the ruins at Pecos that had once been the largest town of the Pueblo Indians , Stephen Watts Kearny had intersected a con- quest of his predecessor , Coronado . President Polk 's brigadier had taken over a harvesting whose last yields are not yet in , and today at Taos or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making what he can of it , of blood and cruelty remembered for centuries and not yet resolved . The shaping of that memory began with Coronado and the Spanish search for cities named for the buffalo ? cities which were said to be paved and roofed with gold . That same day , August 12 , all messengers and prisoners said that Armijo had fled his position in Apache Canyon . So the road was open and Captain Johnston , of Kearny 's staff , wrote in his journal , " here is the end of the campaign . " Tuesday , August 18 , a cloudy morning with occasional showers . The army marched before dawn , twisting through the defile . They reached the abandoned fortifications and decided that a few hundred men could have held them off , though the engineers thought , that the position could have been turned . Out of the canyon to sagebrush flats , arroyos , foothills , small canyons . By midafternoon they were trudging across the high plain above Santa Fe , a slow line of dirty , ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited for the laboring artillery to come up . They were tired and hungry , but below them lay the Royal City of the Holy Faith of Saint Francis . The sudden wealth of trees hid its full extent and the adobe houses were dingy against overcast skies . To most of the army it seemed a miserable and dirty town , but it was a capital city and older than any settlement in the United Stales . Late in the afternoon the conquerors were ready . Two suboilicials had come out to profess submission and , sending his artillery to a hill that commanded the town , Kearny rode back with them and his staff , the army following in column . Bridles jingled and scabbards clanked in the little , twisting , dirty streets , between the brown adobe houses . There was a low wailing behind shuttered windows where women cowered in terror of the rape and branding which the priests had told them the Americans meant to inflict . Soldiers filed into the Plaza of the Constitution , which has always been the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tired horses drooped ; in the silence one heard the rustle of cottonwoods and the silver music of the creek . The ranks stiffened and the muskets came to present arms , Kearny and his staff raised their sabers , the bugles blared down those empty streets , and the flag went up . As it touched the top of the staff , the artillery on the hilltop boomed its salute , and for the first time in history the Americans had conquered a foreign capital . And they had done exactly what Mr. Polk had instructed them to do : they had taken New Mexico without firing a shot . 29 Kearny 's men began to shed some of the indurated provincialism they had brought here . At first they just gaped at the unfamiliar . It was laughable but it was nicely colored . The town was full of Indians ? some of familiar types , others very strange . There were the Pueblo people , fat , docile , and tamed ? or , as at Santo Domingo , warlike , haughty , bearing themselves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in to investigate the conquerors and calculate the chances . All these in scarlet , green , purple ? and the New Mexicans also violent in color . Men in breeches slit to show their drawers , operatic with cloaks , musical with spurs and silver ornaments . Women also in primary colors , barelegged , short-skirted , low-waisted . The Missourians were shocked by the paint on their faces , their familiarity and easy laughter , and , the truth is , by the charm they gave to what had to be considered vice . They showed their breasts and , it was believed , ? in fact it soon proved ,  --  they could be easily possessed , for pay , for kindness , or for mere amenity . An instructed prudery showed itself : sex ought not to be decorative . This was a simple , childlike , gay people , given to fandangos , feasts , parades . One joined them at first derisively , then with the simplicity of boys on a holiday . So the frail girls could be frail charmingly , and Inez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like Betsy when the fiddles were playing a hoedown at a corn husking back home . Similarly with other things . The farm boys began by laughing at an alien way of life but pretty soon were taking to it wills the readiness of all Yankee armies . They were lofty toward alien agriculture ? irrigation , intensive cultivation , a French valuation of manure and waste . It was comic of the foreigners to work their women in the fields , of the women to carry baskets on their heads . The jackasses no larger than St. Bernards , with produce piled high on their backs , were funny . The communal herds were funny , goat 's milk was funny , the children herding the goats with hugs and kisses were funny . Then they were n't funny any longer . The Missourians decided that they would never understand these people , and no matter . They crowded the Plaza with them , evenings and Sundays , shot dice and played monte with them , were rolling cigarettes and learning to eat chili Without tears . They played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an evening and jabbered with him and his wife and his aunts and aunts-in-law in a mixed jargon which no one understood . They swarmed to innumerable fandangos . They learned some good addresses . They hauled a huge , antique press down from Taos and began to publish a newspaper . They organized debating societies , legislatures , glee clubs . The city slickers of the Laclede Rangers set up a theatrical company ? and the New Mexicans could now raise their eyebrows at a barbarian morality which dressed up blond young lieutenants in women 's clothes . Kearny was organizing the conquest and preparing the future . His proclamation was hardly dry when he began reducing the taxes that had sweated these people for two centuries . He made every possible demonstration of peace , courted the fat , powerful priests , was brisk and kind to the humble . Kearny broke bread , made speeches , granted privileges , accepted the kindly honors heaped on him , commanded the presence of raiding Indians whom he ordered to make treaties , memorized the protocol and details of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polk had imposed , of organizing the civil law . Whatever help he might need was at hand in his own regiment . He called on Francis P. Blair , Jr. , Captain Waldo the trader , the historian John ' 1 ' . I lughes , and a private of Captain Moss 's Company C , a N-year-old genius named Willard P. Hall , a Yale man removed from Baltimore to Missouri . They produced a constitution and a code , which Kearny proclaimed the law of the commonwealth . Later , in the chaos that headed up in 1850 , Congress would find that Polk , through Kearny , had exceeded his authority and would rescind part of them . But , in their essentials , they governed New Mexico up to statehood , and large parts of them govern New Mexico today . Not a bad achievement for soldiers taken from barracks duty to build a state ? and another way in which this conquest was strange to a much conquered people . 30 Having conquered and pacified his province , Kearny prepared to carry out the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to California . Another regiment of volunteers , the Second Missouri , was coining down the trailunder Sterling Price . It could garrison Santa Fe . Five hundred of the migrating Mormons had been enlisted and would follow Kearny to California ? Philip St. George Cooke , promoted lieutenant colonel , was sent back to lead them when their commander died . That left the First Missouri without occupation . Kearny decided that they would be most useful farther south . He ordered Doniphan to join General Wool at Chihuahua . There was no way of knowing that Wool was not at Chihuahua , that he never would get there , that even now his expedition was foundering in the country which Polk supposed it could cross without effort . Kearny departed for California on September 25 , leaving Doniphan one further chore : he would be so good as to settle the Indian question . He would , that is , notify the Navajo , the Apache , and the Ute that they were no longer licensed to rob and murder New Mexicans ; he would make treaties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare them into peace . Space is lacking to describe the campaigns of October and November , which were pure prodigy . In small detachments , the First Missouri combed country where troops had never gone before and have never gone since ? country which , mostly , seems beyond the ability of armies to invade . They shoved their horses up mountains of glare ice ; they slept under snow ; they crossed rock deserts and climbed clown the vertical canyons of that waste , even reaching the Canyon de Chelly . They convinced the Ute , who promised to be very good Indians indeed . The Navajo , who outnumbered them hundreds to one , could have annihilated them but achieved an idea that these were an altogether new and novel kind of white men and behaved with extreme respect . The First Missouri had danced with the Pueblo over some Navajo scalps ; now it was their pleasure to dance with the Navajo over sonic Pueblo scalps . They got some new horses , they filled their pockets with souVenirs , some of them were able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should have had never did catch Up with them . Finally , on November 21 , Doniphan herded several thousand Navajo to a rendezvous at Bear Spring . There followed the slow , stately , and preposterous ceremonies by which Indians and army officers were accustomed to reach agreement ? parades , feasts , drama , sham battles , and endless oratory . The Navajo claimed alliance with the Americans , who had come here to make war on the New Mexicans and appeared to be illogical when they asked the Indians not // to do likewise . Doniphan got that point cleared up and the New Mexicans classified as Americans who must not be robbed or murdered from now on . A treaty as formal as one with a major Power was drawn up . By its terms the Navajo agreed to cherish not only the New Mexicans but the Pueblo as well . Doniphan , Jackson , and Gilpin signed it on behalf of James IC Polk , the father of these good children , and no less than fourteen Navajo chiefs scratched their crosses underneath . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back at the Rio Grande , where his various organizations were disposed between Socorro and Santa Fe . Some of them now got the $42 clothing allowance they should have had in May , the first pay they had received and the last they were to get while on active service . Doniphan began to prepare them for the rest of the campaign . A good many of them had died in the Indian country or on the way back ; more had fallen sick . The job had had to be clone without preparation , with inadequate supplies , poor food , no shelter against the weather . The Doniphesias were baying their resentment ? but with a difference now . They had always beefed and bellyached ? they always would ; but now their complaints had a new tone , the confidence of tested men . They had done the unparalleled , and had clone it easily . They were veterans . With 856 effectives Doniphan started south on December 12 ( half their year 's enlistment had been completed on December 10 ) , and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traders at Valverde broke camp and went with the army or just behind it , an anxiety and a ghastly inconvenience . The weather had turned cold and there was nothing but dry grass and soapweed for the fires . Between December 19 and 23 they came together again at Dona Ana. here rumors of great armies coming up from El Paso thickened . On Christmas Eve the camp was under investigation by Mexicans , but no one felt alarmed and no one thought to push the scouts out farther the next morning . They welcomed Christmas with gunfire and band music , then took up the march in excellent spirits . The camp had not been well made or closely guarded , and much of the stock had strayed , so that Doniphan 's trains and a third of his regiment were strung out for miles behind him . The boys sang and joked their way for eighteen miles , then pitched camp toward three o'clock , at a place called El Brazito . It was not far from the present hamlet of Mesilla , New Mexico , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good camp site and , rejoiced to be let off with a Christmas march of only eighteen miles , the greater part of the army whooped off to water their mounts and gather firewood . During the march some scouts had brought in a beautiful white stallion . It caught the appreciative Missouri eye . Doniphan and several of his officers spread out a blanket and sat down to a game of loo to determine whose horse it was . The cards ran Doniphan 's way and he had just got a hand which would have ended matters , when he looked up and saw a Mexican army forming a battle line half a mile away . Cursing the interruption , he buckled on his saber and prepared to improvise a battle . It was an army somewhat larger than Doniphan 's total force and had been gathered at El Paso by a temporary general named Ponce de Leon after earlier recruiting efforts had failed . It was adequately equipped and clad in the gorgeous uniforms that no Mexican force ever failed to acquire , but it lacked fighting men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from El Paso to annihilate the Gringos , whom it despised with the universal Mexican contempt of blonds . It had a piratical black flag with two death's-heads lettered Liberkul 6 muerte , and a punctilious officer carried this banner forward to invite Doniphan to surrender . Doniphan , who had got his sidearms on , returned the traditional answer , and the pause had allowed most of the wood-gatherers to conic in shouting . Doniphan formed them , perhaps four hundred all told , into a kind of line as infantry . The Mexicans began bleating at them with a two-pound howitzer loaded with copper slugs , then fired continuously but wildly from their whole line . The First Missouri were under fire at last , six months out from Fort Leavenworth , and were pleasantly stimulated . Curious about the howitzer , which was posted on a flank , some Company G boys ran out and took it . The Mexicans knew that battles were won by charging and , infantry and lancers alike , trotted forward , firing as they came . Doniphan had his men lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At about a hundred yards he gave the charge two volleys . The charge stopped and the Mexican army began to run away , except that it couple of hundred lancers veered off to a flank and tried to attack some of the wagons . The efficient Reid , however , had got some twenty of his company mounted and launched them at time lancers , who joined their companions to the rear . Reid could not catch up with them and they galloped on to El Paso , where they reported that the war was lost . It had taken less than thirty minutes . Stragglers hurrying up the road at the sound of gunfire got there too late for the fun , and in fact not all the wood-gatherers got in . Doniphan reported 43 Mexicans known to be killed and 150 wounded . Seven of his Missourians had flesh wounds which they could flourish at less fortunate companions . Arguing violently about who had clone the most execution , they went out to gather in the commissary . They got sizable stores of bread and cigars and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , veterans also of gunfire now , the First Missouri settled down to celebrate Christmas . But in the excitement the white stallion had bolted . 31 Entering El Paso the next clay , the army had arrived at a considerable city . It was the last outpost of the Great Spain that had found New Mexico beyond its strength . More than ten thousand people , a more vigorous stock than the New Mexicans , lived in the beautiful town in its green valley , and an ancient culture flourished there . But Doniphan , at the end of a thousand-mile line of communication , two thousand miles from the War Department , did not know what to do . ' 1'lle White house had arranged for Wool to take Chihuahua . Doniphan now knew that the trivialities of terrain and command which the White House strategy had disregarded had broken up the pretty plan . ( Happily he did not know that 11 issouri , hearing that Wool had turned back , supposed that its Mounted Volunteers were lost forever and was now mourning them . ) Rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had Southern Chihuahua and its neighbors rising en masse to destroy its invaders . What was he to do ? Councils of war produced conflicting advice , ? the army , if consulted , would have turned back , Private Robinson said , ? and finally Doniphan put an end to debate . The hell with it : he would go on and do Wool 's job . lle sent for his artillery but at Santa Fe Price , who had extinguished one revolt just as it got started , was wary . lie would release only Major Meriwether Lewis Clark and the battery of Captain Weightman , and wanted some time before releasing them . Doniphan cracked down on the traders , who had been an annoyance all along and were a burden from now on . Some of them had set up shop in El Paso and were doing an excellent business . Some bolted ahead to Chihuahua to run their chances ; and , though Doniphan sent a posse after them , most of these gotaway . Others held back , intending to wait till the invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detour it at their convenience . They were , however , a possible source of manpower , and Doniphan got tough . He called in his patrols , who had been looking for Chihuahua troops or chasing Apache for the inhabitants . Clark arrived with Weightman 's artillery on February 1 , and a week later the First Missouri took up the march . The unruly traders were now commanded to form themselves into a military battalion and take part in their own defense . They did so and Samuel Owens , the half-brother of one of A. Lincoln 's fianc ? es , was made their major . Over two hundred of them were enrolled and they had more than three hundred wagons . The arrival of the artillery had brought Doniphial 's strength to 924 effectives . They were marching again , the job they did best . On the sixth day out they got themselves into a prairie fire . A campfire spread into the mountains , where it burned beside them throughout a clay 's march . Lieutenant Gibson remembered an old song , " Fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that night they had to run when a gale drove the flames down to their camp . There was a wild half-hour while the army set backfires , galloped the horses and wagons about , and swore at one another in pyrotechnic light till the show was over . Still another kind of campfire had been added to their memories . Doniphan had been keeping them in military formation the last few days and his reconnaissance parties had seen evidence of hostilities ahead . 011 the night of February 27 he camped some fifteen miles north of a creek called the Sacramento , which was about the same distance north of the city of Chihuahua . His scouts and some stragglers who had come into camp had told him that the Mexicans had gathered at the Sacramento and were prepared to fight him there . The information was accurate ; the First Missouri was going to have a battle . C111/1/1ailUa had raised and equipped a sizable force , after floundering through the period of factionalism , jealousy , and treachery that attended every part of the Mexican war effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a thousand additional pressed peons who were armed principally with machetes . It did not have Santa Anna to drill it , however , and he was the only one who could make marksmen out of peaceable , oppressed people not used to bearing arms . Its general was a trained engineer but neither he , his soldiers , nor the supporting population had acquired any respect for their enemy . Throughout the war Mexican armies were always being half paralyzed at the beginning of an action by the discovery that the cowardly Gringos would fight . As scouts reported the approach of Doniphan 's command , an exhilaration seized Chihuahua . Battle rhetoric in newspapers , broadsides , and the sermons of priests promised everyone an overwhelming victory . About a thousand people went out to make a bleachers at the expected battleground , and the army took with it a thousand prepared ropes . They would make a cofile in which to lead the captured Americans to Mexico City . Conde , the commander , had prepared a fortified position near the crossing of the Sacramento , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a first-rate engineer and brought against the First Missouri the science of fortification which reached back all the way to Roman times and had been maturing ever since . The works would have edified Uncle Toby and should have been impregnable to assault . Conde failed to consider only one eventuality : what if the Americans did not know the textbook approach ? Ile should have considered it , for , after reconnoitering the position , Doniphan and his staff saw no reason why they need come by the route prepared for them . On the morning of February 18 they started out from camp , Clark 's band rendering " Yankee Doodle . " On the way to the Sacramento , Doniphan gave them a battle formation new to the art of war but excellently adapted to the circumstances . He formed his train and the wagons of the traders in four parallel columns ? the moving fort of any caravan on the Santa Fe Trail when it was on guard against Indian attack . In extremity the wagons could have formed a corral , within which the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his cavalry , infantry , and artillery in the intervals between columns , where it was ready to deploy at need . The classical American symbol , a train of white-tops , moved compactly toward the Sacramento . Approaching the fortifications , Doniphan took his formation to the flank , half turning the Mexican position instead of coming from the front as he was ex-Peeled to do . On the way to the flank there was an arroyo and the Mexican lancers might have cut a disorganized train to pieces . But this train was not disorganized . The high art of the bullwhackers scored a military triumph in getting the wagons across swiftly and in order , to the orchestrated profanity that was appropriate . It was a wild and stimulating time . The now frustrated redoubts opened fire at long range and the panoplied lancers formed under banners . Doniphan ordered his troops out into line and Clark 's artillery shattered the lancers before they got well started . Thereafter for an hour the artillery commands banged at each other . Clark had made his battalion ( part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions ) first-rate artillerists . Though the fuses were faulty and many shells exploded prematurely , he put down a successful barrage . The Mexican pieces were old , their powder was bad . The solid shot they fired came up visibly , bounding and ricocheting . The farm boys watched them come , yelled their appreciation of the show , made bets with one another , and dodged so successfully that the only casualties were horses . The Mexicans made another charge , at the mar and the wagons this time ; and the traders , who could shoot as well as the army , beat it oil without trouble . Doniphan moved his lines nearer the half-turned redoubts , and musketry fire blazed everywhere . The Missourians were shooting in earnest , but the truth is that the Mexicans , who had had no practice with arms and had been battered by artillery , mostly contented themselves with hoisting their pieces over the parapets and discharging them at the sky . Doniphan , who sat on his horse and cursed with homespun eloquence , watched the army work up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then launched three companies of cavalry and Weightman 's artillery in a charge at the Mexican guns . It started out gaudily , but his adjutant , DeCourcy ( who was rumored to be drunk ) , halted two of the companies halfway across . Doniphan got a bad scare and the halted companies stood cursing with fire coming at them from two directions . Weightman galloped his two howitzers halfway to the redoubts , unlimbered , and began to fire again . Owens , the trader , with two companions galloped down the front of the redoubts and got himself killed . Reid had not obeyed the order to halt , but took his company up to the parapets and over them . The two companies that had halted joined him , and the forts were carried in a few minutes of chaotic battle . The Missourians used their sabers , their clubbed muskets , convenient stones , and even their fists . The few minutes were gory enough to provide them with a lifetime of reminiscence ? beheaded Mexicans , Mexicans split lengthwise , Mexicans shot clown on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared horses stampeding , roar of artillery , mountain men on one knee drawing beads , and the boys from home acting much as they did at a turkey shoot . The Mexicans broke and ran . Some of them tried to rally on the other hill , but simultaneously Gilpin 's wing swarmed over those fortifications and now everyone was running , The First Missouri , an army of victorious individualists , milled round for anybody 's horse that was handy and began a pursuit . They sabered Mexicans on the ran , they chased them down the river , they chased them into the hills , where some Apache who had taken box seats for the spectacle killed a number ; and a big moon came up and the Mexicans were still running . Some of them ran the full fifteen miles to Chihuahua . The Americans came straggling back to the battlefield by moonlight , found the surgeons of both armies gathering in the wounded , and answered the yells of their officers , who were trying to bring the victors together again as an army . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trader , bad been killed . ( Legend says that he had some romantic reason for wanting to die and had dressed in white clothes before the battle . ) A sergeant had received a wound from which he died , and seven others had minor wounds . On their part , they had killed more than three hundred Mexicans , wounded at least as many snore , taken forty prisoners , and permanently broken resistance in the State of Chihuahua . While the wounded screamed in the mesquite , the First Missouri ranged over the field to gather in the spoils . They were considerable , for Chihuahua had done well by its defenders . The Doniphesias got ten cannon and a miscellany of antique trench pieces , hundreds of small arms , many tons of powder , seven elegant carriages belonging to generals and their guests , Conde 's field desk , scores of wagons and carts , hundreds of horses and mules and beeves , thousands of sheep . They got the ropes in which they were to have been marched to Mexico City and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Brazito . They got a paymaster 's box with $3000 in copper coin , and they got an amount of silver which may have been $5000 or $50,000 , but was carefully not reported to their officers . They loaded their pockets , belts , and haversacks with loot and came back to report themselves . So they had still another kind of campfire , victorious under a big moon with the wounded moaning near by and Missouri two thousand miles from home , pounding one another 's backs , wringing the officers ' hands , and beginning to tell the stories that would bore their grandchildren . The next day , March 1 , Doniphan sent Mitchell and an advance guard to occupy Chihuahua , and on March 2 rode at the head of his column into this , the principal city of Northern Mexico , which had fallen to a handful of ragged boys from the prairies . Forgive him if he swaggered , " not unlike a strutting gander , " and forgive the boys , frowzy , ill-smelling , and unshaved , if , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's March , " they told each other that they had kept their oath and captured the Halls of Montezuma . A populace which had been promised the complete destruction of the invading heretics was panic-stricken , gaped at the conquerors in terror mingled with disbelief , and hurried out the prettiest senoritas with melons , tortillas , and more wine . The army swaggered and yelled behind its bands ? past the mint , past the great cathedral , round the plaza , and on to ceremonies of capitulation . Private Robinson , nineteen years old a few days back , wrote in his diary a good soldier 's summary : " We rode through the principal streets and public square , and on a rocky hill on the south side of the city fired a national salute in honor of the conquest , stole wood enough to get supper , and went to bed as usual among the rocks . " Eight months after the administration strategists had laid out this campaign in the Executive office , an improvised organization had fulfilled the President 's intent , deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by application of their native talents to the task at hand . Frontiersmen easily changing phase , farmers becoming soldiers , they had conducted a probably impossible campaign to victory . In a year of decision they had produced a decision . Chihuahua , one of the " Northern Provinces " of Mr. Polk 's concern , had been made secure for the duration . New Mexico was also secure . Since New Mexico was secure , California also was secure . Moreover , the Southwestern Indians , the Navajo and the Apache , though far from dissuaded , had at least learned to be cautious . Finally , by its mere presence in Chihuahua , the First Missouri had turned a balance farther to the east . On February 22 and 23 , Taylor 's subalterns won the battle of Buena Vista ? but barely won it . It was a bloody battle , and the excellent army which Santa Anna load raised lost it by an extremely narrow margin . If Santa Anna could have had the troops which faced Doniphan at Sacramento , it is likely that Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of Coahuila. 32 Sacramento and Chihuahua made the high moment of the First Missouri . From then on , life was pleasant enough but an anti-climax of gar- risen duty , drill , abortive expeditions , rumors , rioting , and finally the march to the Rio Grande . They occupied Chihuahua through March till nearly the end of April , while Doniphan tried to get orders from the War Department or any superior officer . They got the news of Buena Vista ( fought February 22-23 ) and made the town reverberate . At last one of Doniphan 's patrols got through to Wool at Saltillo and came back with orders from Taylor to join him there . Some of the traders prepared to stay at Chihuahua , others to go back to Santa Fe , still others to march through the interior with their custodians . Doniphan released his prisoners and discharged his governors , turning the city back to its officials . He got the First Missouri ready to move again . A few farm boys " went over the hill " to marry their senoritas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on breeches and prepared to follow their farm boys . And on April 2.5 , 26 , and 28 , in various divisions , the army left Chihuahua , heading south and east . They had a diversified march to make ? more jornadas , more mountains , more green valleys . But they were certainly the best marchers in the world by now , and though ? as always ? some sickened and a few died , they put their shoulders into it . Dust , sand , swamps , summer heat , lizards , scorpions , snakes ? nothing mattered now that they had turned east . Doniphan laid the gad to them and all their records toppled . They foraged liberally but also they chased Apache and Comanche for the natives , Mitchell and the indefatigable Reid riding the flanks in sweeping forays . The army came down to the beautiful oasis of Parras and for the first time encountered a population who had learned to fear and hate American soldiers , a lesson the Doniphesias had taught no one . " Wherever we encamped , in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell different articles , never meeting with insult or injury . " Wool 's and Taylor 's troops had given the natives wholly different emotions , and from now on the Doniphesias would see an ugliness of war that was strange to them . Another hitch brought them to Saltillo and on to the battlefield of Buena Vista and the headquarters of General Wool . Doniphan tried to brush and curry them a little , but it was no use . Drawing full rations at last , after eleven months , some of them refused soap , explaining that they had no clothes to wash . Doniphan got them into line long enough for Wool , the prccisian , to review them , but again it was no use ? they gaped and lounged and made remarks . Wooltried to re-enlist them for another year , which showed optimism . Even Meriwether Lewis Clark made comments on the way the War Department had treated them , and when Wool said he would take care of than Clark remembered out loud that they had heard the same story at Fort Leavenworth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Monterrey , and found that they loved him and his great-commoner act . They left their sick here ? lowlands and tropical weather were cutting them down ? and marched on to the Rio Grande . At Reynosa they had reached navigable water ? by marching almost exactly thirty-five hundred miles from Fort Leavenworth . Here , ending a feat of arms without parallel , they awaited transports in rain , , swamps , and muggy heat . They were dirty , they were lousy , they had practically no clothes left , and they acquired a new set of grievances against the war . The government could not send their horses home by boat but would try to drive them overland ? and could not transport their outfits . They burned their saddles and blankets and crowded aboard bad transports , to cat weevily hardtack , be seasick , and find themselves with as little drinking water as if they were making another jornada . So they came to New Orleans and down the gangplanks , some of them wearing only greatcoats , some just their drawers , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was near enough to the war to recognize heroes at sight , went wild over them . Missouri outdid New Orleans . St. Louis ? where they found friends who had grown rich from the war , as they assuredly had not ? broke out its bunting and illuminations and deafened the heroes with as much cannon fire as they had heard at Sacramento . As long as they lived , the twelvemonth 's march would splash their past with carmine ? prairie grass in the wind , night guard at the wagons , the high breasts of the Spanish . Peaks and all New Mexico spread out before them from the Raton , fandangos at Santa Fe , glare ice above the Canyon de Chelly , the hot gladness of the charge at Sacramento , the grizzly that wandered through our camp that night , tongues swollen by the jornadas , Jim dying in the snow , the ammonia stench of the buffalo wallows , the campfires glimmering in a slanting line of rubies all the way up the pass , the senorita who looked in the wagon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exquisite Spanish word pobrecite when heard from such lips . " They too
