Besides playing host to Winston Churchill and other visiting notables last week , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology attended to some personal business : it inaugurated a new president , James Rhyne Killian Jr . <P> At 44 , Killian , an old M.I.T. man himself , was taking over one of the foremost technical institutions in the world . It consisted of a student body of 4,500 , a faculty of 1,000 , and a compact , impressive campus of Roman revival and modern buildings across the Charles River from Boston . M.I.T. had come a long way since its opening classes in 1865 . <P> " A Memorable Day . " One day in that year , Founder William Barton Rogers scribbled in his diary : " Organized the School ! Fifteen students entered . May not this prove a memorable day ! " Rogers , a former professor of natural philosophy at the University of Virginia , began his school in one room of Boston 's shabby Mercantile Building . By the following fall , he had a faculty of ten ( including Harvard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died 17 years later , in the middle of a commencement speech , M.I.T. was well on its way . <P> <P> It soon became what Rogers ' stern successor , Francis A. Walker , had stamped it , " a place for men to work , not for boys to play . " M.I.T. experimented with a football team for a while , gave it up 45 years ago . In the years after the Civil War , when the U.S. needed engineers and mechanics more than ever before , M.I.T. had no time for the cultural preoccupations of the liberal-arts colleges . While neighbor Harvard was enjoying the Golden Age of William James and Santayana , M.I.T. was off on a tangent of its own . It was the first U.S. college to have a department of meteorology , . of chemical , architectural and electrical engineering . It was the first to require its students to have regular laboratory instructions in physics and chemistry . <P> M.I.T. has become a place for differential analyzers , spectro-photometers , oscillographs and thryatron tubes . Out of its laboratories it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgess and Author Stuart Chase . But M.I.T. 's alumni are more apt to be of another sort : Donald Douglas of Douglas Aircraft , Alfred P. Sloan Jr . of General Motors , Gerard Swope of General Electric , and at least ten Du Fonts . <P> A Fourth Estate . In a way , Killian will be an odd sort of president for M.I.T. He is neither a scientist nor an engineer , and he never earned a Ph.D . He is a quiet , competent man , who got his bachelor 's degree in business and engineering administration . To support himself as a student , he went to work for the Technology Review , stayed until 1939 when President Karl T. Compton made him his executive assistant . A kindly and laconic man who likes hiking and the novels of George <P> Meredith , he has already begun to talk about the responsibility of future engineers , and M.I.T. 's " fourth estate " - the social sciences and the humanities . Last week , in his inaugural address , he spoke of these responsibilities again . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must add a new ingredient-the new social mind called for by Henry Adams . The specialist must shun the view that lopsidedness is laudable ; he must be politically and morally responsible ; he must test his actions by their human impact . . . "
