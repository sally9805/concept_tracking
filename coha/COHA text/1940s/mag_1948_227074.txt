THE REIGN OF QUEEN VICTORIA ( 437 pp. ) - Hector Bolitho - Macmillan ( $5 ) <P> When Lytton Strachey 's Queen Victoria appeared , at the dawn of the debunking ' 20s , many critics deplored its un-Victorian tone and sardonic bias . Now , time has so mellowed Strachey 's lse-majest that his biography has been accepted both as a classic study of Victorianism and a human portrait of the great Queen . <P> This new biography of Victoria , which is Bolitho 's ninth about this period , has nothing of Strachey 's amused , amusing manner , nothing of his skepticism and silky grace . Above all , it does not contain a single sentence that even runs a risk of being thought dangerously brilliant . All present or accounted for are the famous , fascinating figures of the great era-Baron Stockmar , Lord Melbourne , Lord Palmerston , Mr. Gladstone , Disraeli , the Duke of Wellington , et al. - and so frigidly correct that they appear to have been hewn from frozen blocks of Birds Eye . <P> Author Bolitho 's reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the emergence of fresh material-among others , hitherto unpublished letters from Prince Consort Albert to his German tutor , letters from the Queen to her daughter the Empress of Germany , tappings from such virgin sources as the late Queen Marie of Rumania , certain aged members of Victoria 's court and the 19th Century files of the Hartford ( Conn . ) Times and Courant . Hardly enough to justify a new and inferior biography .
