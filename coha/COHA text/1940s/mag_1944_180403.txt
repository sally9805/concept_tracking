A.F. of L. 's William Green hurried into the White House . The President , flanked by Madame Frances Perkins , had a little suggestion to make . For ten years , Mr. Green 's A.F. of L. had been the sole U.S. labor representative at the International Labor Organization . Next month 's I.L.O . session at Philadelphia , with its weighty postwar agenda , might well be a most momentous meeting . Why not give C.I.O. a half interest in U.S. labor 's one international vote ? <P> Stiffly , William Green left the White House . Dutifully , he polled his Executive Committee , wrote to the President with " deep regret " that his A.F. of L. would either : 1 ) continue to be U.S. labor 's sole and exclusive spokesman , or 2 ) resign from I.L.O . <P> Last week the President searched for a compromise which would not leave pro-New Deal C.I.O. out in the election-year cold . Franklin Roosevelt did not want A.F. of L. 's 6.5 million members to withdraw into a long , disastrous fit of isolationist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too .
