Under the big gold dome of San Francisco 's City Hall there were sighs and reminiscent laughter . In the press room and in the ornate , blue and gilt Chamber where the City 's Board of Supervisors meets , they knew that something wonderful was gone . Ruddy , jut-jawed James B. McSheehy , master of the mangled metaphor , was dead . <P> In his 24 years as a city official , Supervisor McSheehy took pride in his oratorical blockbusters . He boasted that one reporter was permanently assigned to collect each day 's most glaring and improbable McSheehyisms . A belligerent , charming , oldfashioned , long-winded politician who loved the sound of his own voice , McSheehy orated on &; on-and was loved for his majesty of phrasing . Students of metaphor-mixing compared him to Philadelphia 's famed ex-Councilman Charles Pommer , a slapdash stylist with a less subtle ear ( " I have always been man enough to stand on my own two shoulders " - TIME , Nov. 20 , 1939 ) . He was also ranked with Hollywood 's Samuel Goldwyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Goldwyn quotations ( " They are always biting the hand that lays the golden egg " ) . <P> At bars , at lunch tables , throughout the City Hall , San Francisco remembered last week , laughed fondly and gratefully , quoted and requoted some of McSheehy 's best : <P> " Let us take the bull by the tail and look the matter squarely in the face . " <P> " Gentlemen , the sum mentioned comes within a few cents of being a vast and fabulous sum of money . " <P> " The handwriting on the wall is just as clear as a bell . " <P> " That is all water over a wheel and now it 's coming back to haunt us . " <P> " This is crouched in language which is perfectly oblivious . "
