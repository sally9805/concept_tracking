txt The American oil industry as a whole will earn leas in the current quarter than in the comparable 1940 period . Net profits are being pared by lower prices for gasoline  --  the industry 's most important money product  --  and for kerosene and fuel oils . But . because price levels now vary , widely in various sections , some groups of companies appear certain to report earnings above the average showing for the industry . Individual units may even succeed in bettering last year 's first period resulks . Faring best as a group will be the so-called interior companies . Gasoline prices in this central U. S area show an average reduction of but 0.06 cents a gallon from the level prevailing at this time last year . Also important from a profit standpoint , is the declining production of the Michigan and Illinois oil fields with a consequent lessening of competition from products refined from the output of these wells . Moreover , the crude oil situation gives indications of firming and the prospects are for continued improvement . Companies in Beet Position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indiana and Pure Oil , have substantial stakes in this area and . hence should come through the initial quarter with fairly good profit showings . Refiners and marketers on the eastern seaboard have suffered most from low prices . Gasoline , as an example . is selling about 1.6 cents a gallon less than a year ago . In addition , their operations have been affected by weaker markets for kerosene and fuel oils , also important products . Socony-Vacuum . Standard of N. J .. Texas Corp .. Tide Water , Shell Union , Consolidated , Gulf . Sun and Atlantic Refining are principally engaged in this territory . although Texas . Consolidated . Tide Water . Gulf and Shell also have sizeable interests in other sections of the country . - PRciiic Coast Situation improving ' Earnings of companies on the Pacgie-Coaaf are not likely to measure up to those of a year ago . at least in the first five months , because of lower prices prevailing currently for gasoline which is selling about 1.3 cents a gallon below a year ago . The major reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lowered the average from 10.78 cents in the second quarter to 9.89 cents in the third quarter where it is holding at present . Barring the imposition of further restrictions on exports , it appears that the Pacific Coast situation is heading for improvement , rinse the gasoline position is slightly better . It would seem possible , therefore , that the final half might witness an upturn in profits . Standard Oil of California , Union Oil and Richfield are the principal units there , although Shell , Tide Water , Socony-Vacuum , Consolidated and Texas also have large interests . Solely producing companies , such as Amerada , Plymouth . Barnsdall , Seaboard and Louisiana Land &; Exploration , have not been affected by price changes of any importance in the past year and their profits , in consequence , should make fairly good comparisons with the initial period of 1940 . Six companies which have released their 1940 reports of income showed aggregate profits of $40,283,552 compared with $34,951,057 in 1939. an improvement of slightly more than 15% . It is expected that the industry , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from 10% to 15% higher than in 1939.
