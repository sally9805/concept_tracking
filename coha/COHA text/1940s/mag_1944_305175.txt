This week the finger of justice was leveled once more at long-dead Ivar Kreuger . He was named , dead or alive , as a coconspirator in an antitrust complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against 18 match corporations and match kings . <P> The naming of Swedish Match King Kreuger was historically appropriate . But it was more appropriate that the No. 1 corporate defendant should be the U.S. 's Diamond Match Co. , and that the first individual named was Diamond 's secretive , 67-year-old engineer president , William Armstrong Fairburn . Match King Fairburn , who works most of the time at his secluded , tree-hedged ranch in California 's Ojai Valley and rarely appears in Diamond 's discreet Manhattan offices , has run Diamond like a Central American dictator since 1910 , when he was called in to figure out how to make matches without poisoning match workers . <P> Ivar Kreuger , who shot himself in his Paris apartment twelve years ago , was second to no man in his ability to parlay a bunch of match companies into an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker , was the man who could almost always beat Kreuger at the match game-at least in the U.S. market , which is all that Mr. Fairburn ever cared much about . In sundry Kreuger forays into Diamond 's bailiwick , Fairburn had a way of selling him U.S. match interests at a fancy price , but ending up with Diamond still in the saddle . <P> Justice v. Diamond . Besides Fairburn and five other match kings , this week 's antitrust action named the five top U.S. match producers ( starting with Diamond and all allegedly controlled by it ) who account for 83% of all U.S. production , plus two British , one Canadian , and three Swedish companies . This cartel , charged Justice , controls some 75% of the world 's match business ( the Japanese* and the Russians handle most of the rest ) . Its members have divided up the world among themselves and , except in rare spasms of greed , scrupulously refrain from trespassing on each other 's preserves . <P> Some highlights in the complaint : <P> Diamond deals with Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorate of potash capacity , an essential not only of match making but of ammunition , when war broke out . <P> As a favor to Swedish Match , Diamond refused to sell match-starved Latin America either match machinery ( of which Diamond has a U.S. monopoly ) or matches under the U.S. label . <P> A European-invented " repeating or everlasting match " - a pencil-size gadget that ignites on scratching , can be blown out and relit up to 140 times in a row - was suppressed . Diamond was glad to help keep it off the market because , as Justice quotes from Diamond files , it : 1 ) was " a distinct danger to the American match industry " ; 2 ) " would be a fertile field for the rottenest kind of competition . " <P> So What ?
