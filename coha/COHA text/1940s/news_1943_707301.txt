txt Enemy Victims Still Aliens I quote an editorial printed in your paper last week : " It is enough to know that there are just two kinds of people in this world at present : those who support the Axis regimes and philosophies and those who do not . * * Our enemy 's victims , whoever they are , are our next of kin . " Surely every right-thinking American agrees with you . But we yet brand many of " our enemy 's victims " as enemy aliens . Speaking of the psychological effect such an action would have on the peo of Germany , the removal of this onus would show that we are not fighting the German people , but the Nazi regime and the spirit that engendered it . The removal of this brand is both a matter of common decency and an important military advantage . We can not neglect either . M. D. BIAS , Princeton , N. J. , Sept. a , 1943.                 @ @ @ @
