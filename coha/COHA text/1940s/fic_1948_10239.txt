day , so I could explain to her why ( a + b ) ( a  --  b ) = az  --  b ' , and how upset I was , one of my first week ends at the island , at what Mr. Legg had to say about the people that had taken the cottage next door : " The Finleys , one of the best families in the state , Lee Finley 's in the Fidelity and Deposit , she 's a Dawson , from Prince Georges County , the boy , Dick , goes to Gilman  --  I was delighted when I heard who the place had been leased to . . . . But , Jack , that boy runs liquor . He 's in and out with that boat he 's got at all hours of the night , he has a pistol , and he 's thick with Zeke Torrance . " " Who 's he ? " " He runs the Log Cabin . " " Oh  --  that place near Glen Burnie ? " " That 's the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be a wild boy stopping for a drink . But when Zeke is down here , it 's business , and Zeke has only one business . I complained about the pistol , but Finley only got disagreeable . It seems it 's owned under permit , and the boy uses it only for target shooting as he 's permitted to do . But  --  he wears it . It 's on him all the time , and he goes around with a silly grin on his face , giving a fifth-rate imitation of some character in a ninth-rate movie , and I do n't like it . And  --  he keeps tagging after Helen . " " What ? " " Let 's go get a soda , " Let 's got to the picture show , " How about a swim '  --  " " Does she go ? " " No . She thinks he 's funny . But  --  I do n't know anything in years that has made me so nervous . He keeps following her around , and looking at her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish from an outboard boat they had , so I was on the porch fixing hand lines , knives , and bait , and the rest of them were out front on canvas recliners , reading the papers . I had just checked my snoods when I saw this wild-looking boy crossPIOIover from next door , in dungaree pants and rough shoes and checked shirt . He was around seventeen I would say , fairly big , and heavy sunburned , with shaggy hair and a hangdog grin . He sat down , though I did n't notice anybody ask him to , and then Mr. Legg said something and Helen looked surprised and came inside the screened-in porch , where I was . " Well , Jack , what 's the big idea ? " " Whose ? " " Dad 's . Go put on your beach robe . '  --  ? " " The young visitor , maybe . " " Dick ? He 's a child . " " Little children got big eyes . " " And all this talk whenever Dick wants a date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's much too young to be going around . ' What am I ? Little Eva or something ? " " Going around with him , maybe your father means . " " Well , who would ? " " He 's got to be told something . " " But  --  " She looked down at herself , where she was , just a sliver of brown in a wisp of blue bathing suit , and then went inside and I could see her looking at herself in a mirror . Then she came out with the robe and began putting it on . " I do n't know my own strength , apparently . " I swear it happened that quick . What went in was a child , that you 'd look at because she was pretty and graceful and friendly , but not for any other reason . What came out was a woman , only twelve years old yet , but one you could n't take your eyes off of , for all the reasons there are . She wrapped the robe around her and knotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of way and went switching out there . By that time darling Dickie was gone , but when I got out there with my gear he was back , and had his gun on him , inpIO2 a holster , over his right hip . He started to talk , but Helen kept snickering like he must be crazy , and Margaret and Mr. Legg and Mrs. Legg kept looking at each other in a nervous kind of way while he talked : " Honest , folks , I do n't think you 've thought this thing through . I 'm not taking out Helen in any formal way , you understand . I 'm only asking her to the picture show tonight . It 's not like she was making her debut or something . And frankly I think it would be good for her . If you ask me , Mr. Legg , she does n't go out enough . " " I was n't asking you , Dick . " " Oh ? Oh ? Oh ? " The little grin kept coming and going , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . I do n't smoke , but there was a package of cigarettes in the sand and I picked it up and stuck a cigarette in my mouth and began slapping myself like I wanted a match . Then I stepped over toward Mr. Legg , like I would borrow one from him . Dickie paid no attention . I caught him on the chin with everything I had and he went down soft , which meant he was out . I unbuckled the holster , pulled it clear , then gave him some toe under the ribs . He rolled over . " Get up : " " What are you doing to me , you big  --  " " I said get up . " I yanked him to his feet and he staggered around a little but pretty soon he could stand . Out of the tail of my eye I could see another boy , about his age but quite a lot bigger , come out of the Finley house and stand there watching . I gave Dickie a cuff on the jaw and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and stay out or there 'll be more of the same , only a lot more . And leave Helen alone . Do n't speak to her or look at her or think about her , or it 's going to be most unfortunate . And do n't bring any more guns . What do you say ? " " So O.K. , you hit me when I was n't looking , you  --  " I clipped him again and he went down and when he got uppI03I impressed on his mind he was to call me sir and he did it . Then he went stumbling through the sand to his house and the pal began looking at the marks on his face . Mr. Legg said : " Thanks , Jack . " " Sometimes it 's the only way . " " I 'll take that gun . I 'm making an issue with Finley about it . This thing has gone far enough . " " I 'll save you the trouble . " I swung the holster and gave it a heave and it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet out into Chesapeake Bay . That was the one dumb thing I did . Because I was no sooner unarmed than the pal said something and here the two of them come , one piling in on one side , one on the other . They hit me and I went down but jumped up and backed away . Mr. Legg said something about phoning the state police and Margaret and Mrs. Legg ran into the house . A shell clipped Dickie on the head and he ripped out some cussword and turned . My heart jumped when I saw it was Helen that had thrown it . Mr. Legg began shooing her into the house . All that took maybe one second , maybe two or three . After I went down , Dickie did , and his pal did , and nobody moved fast , because in the sand you slid and lurched and tripped yourself . I backed , though , some kind of way , and they plowed along after me . I felt damp sand under me and then I was in the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see where they were going and I could n't . Then I did something I 'd seen linemen do on many a football field . I grabbed for their heads , but instead of headgears , I caught hair . I jerked them off their feet , and when their faces went in the water I held . They began to wriggle and kick and I held and kept on holding . Bubbles came up and the kicks got slower . By now ,  | in addition to Mr. Legg and Helen , quite a few people , maybe seven or eight , were there , most of them yelling at me to let them have it , it served them right . Then a guy that seemed to be Dickie 's father splashed in and began shaking me and screaming I was murdering his boy . I let them up and dragged them out . They had water in their lungs and I put Pappy to working it out , with artificial respiration . When they could get up I let them have a couple of kicks and chased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porch and Mr. Legg was pouring me a drink and people were arguing about it and it was pretty unanimous I had done a good thing for the island . Mr. Legg kept saying it was " magnificent , " and apologizing for not doing more to help me out . Then he told Helen to tell Margaret there was no need for the police , and to stop calling them , and she went inside . But before she did she gave me a funny , sidelong look , like she was seeing me for the first time . Mr. Legg kept on talking : " Jack , I ca n't tell you what it did to me . I would n't be capable of it in a million years , I may as well admit it . " " It 's mostly muscle . " " More than that . " " And practice . I 've spilled a few guys . " " It 's more than muscle and more than practice . It 's  --  what they used to call courage and now they call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " I tilted the drink and he went on . He was , as I 've said , a small , pink man with a little white mustache , and I do n't know how he ever expected to be much good in a fight . People began going home , and in a few minutes it was all awful quiet . Mr. Legg was worried about what Finley might be up to , and he kept watching . Then after a while he said : " Just the same , I think I 'll send her back . At the hotel Mrs. Brems will look out for her perfectly well , and if she 's not here the main source of trouble will be out of the way . " " You mean  --  Helen ? "  | " Yes . I see it now . He 's showing off for her . " " And the rest of you will stay here ? " " It 's not fair to ruin everybody 's summer . " So I sat right in the boat , watched it drift out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head for Niagara Falls , without lifting a finger to stop it or steer it or sink it . What was I thinking of , to do a thing like that ? Who says I was thinking ? Maybe I 'd lost the capacity to think . For three years I 'd been living in a dead house in a dead city in a dead state , going to a dead school studying the dead history of a dead country . Maybe you 've forgotten 1930 , 1931 , and 1932 , but I have n't . All the things I 'd been taught , about life and love and what it was all about , those lights I was to steer by , had turned into fish scales on me until they were just stuff for guys in college to gag about when they were half shot with beer . If I 'd had the money I 'd earned , that might have helped , anyway until I could figure out where I was at . But it was gone , because the things my father had learned had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help much that the broker had been gentleman enough to knock himself off with a gun . So I 'd let myself in for this marriage I did n't want to a girl I did n't want and a job I did n't want , because I had as much use for the hotel business as a fish has for grass . All the thinking I was doing , I 'd say , was thinking how not to think . If that meant drifting down the stream with this child , who was almost as unhappy as I was , it later turned out , picking flowers off the bank , listening to the bees , and watching the moon come up , then I was a sap all right , no argument about that . But all it meant at the time , so far as either one of us knew , was that it took two minds of what was weighing down two hearts , and was n't due to last any longer than the landing we were headed for , that would put an end to the trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond it , never once entered my mind , and I 'm sure it did n't enter hers . Not that I told her anything about it , or touched her or kissed her or did anything out of line , or even wanted to , that I remember . It was just that I was with her all the time , when I lived in a misty gold dream , and when I was n't with her I was n't even living . By now , she was growing to a woman so fast it made you catch your breath . Her hair had lost that ratty , kid look it had sometimes had , and was soft and glossy over its red-gold color . There were dark circles under her eyes and she had an expression like you see in the paintings of Madonnas . Her movements , that had been quick , all slowed down , so she was the most graceful thing in skirts I think I ever saw . Every motion she made was controlled , it began the right way and ended the right way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too slow . I lived in the hotel now , but for the tutoring we used Margaret 's studio . Whichever shift I worked , we 'd get the lessons in , and the rest of the time we 'd swim in Clifton Park , where there 's a big lake they use for a pool , or go somewhere and dance , or see a picture . Mrs. Brems , the housekeeper , thought it was wonderful we should be such pals , and often put up little lunches , especially when we went swimming , so we could loaf at the pool and really enjoy ourselves . But what we did mostly , if I was free at night , was drive . We drove all over , down into southern Maryland , up into Pennsylvania , over into Virginia . But if we only had a little time we 'd drive out to Lake Roland , where there was a place we could park and sit , or get out and walk around . One of those nights she touched my arm . " Jack . . . up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch where you 're walking . " " But look at it , Jack ! It 's beautiful ! " I looked , but I knew what it was going to be before I looked.  |p107It  was a big luna moth , fluttering above us , full of moonlight . When it was gone her hand was in mine . The algebra did n't go so well . We 'd work at it , she on one side of the card table we set up , me on the other , and the book in the middle , but we did n't seem to get anywhere . It was n't long before I saw , or thought I saw , what the trouble was . What had made the arithmetic go so well was that I 'd really go into it , what she did n't understand , but of course the way to start that off right was with some stuff about how dumb she was , and then we 'd have the roughhouse , but when we got done with it we had our finger on the trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated her like a lady , instead of a hoodlum , and she tried to act like one , and where we got was nowhere . And then one day , toward the end of August , it seemed to me the time was getting short and we better get fundamental if she was ever going to learn anything , so I let go with it . I mean , I hauled out the same old line , that alongside of her a parade of snails would look like graduates of the Johns Hopkins University , or something like that . But that 's as far as I got with it . She burst out crying and sat there with tears squirting out of her eyes and running down on her dress . I jumped up and put my arm around her but she ran over to the sofa and threw herself down on it , face in the pillow , and shook with sobs . " Helen , Helen , what 's the trouble ? Do n't you know it was just a joke ? The same joke we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , what it is you do n't understand ? " " Go on , let me alone . " " Come on , we 'll take a drive and  --  " " Please , please ! " " Here , let me wipe your eyes ! " " No ! No ! Go on , go , go , go ! " pI08 I walked around the room , hoped it would pass and that she 'd let me talk to her , went over and patted her , but it was no soap . I left , and the next two or three days I did n't see her. " jack , where 's Helen ? " " ... I do n't know , Mrs. Legg . Why ? " " Mrs. Brems has n't seen her since lunchtime . I 've had them ring her room and she does n't answer , I 've had her paged  --  maybe she 's just gone downtown somewhere without leaving word . But  --  I have a queer feeling something 's wrong . " " I 'll look into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room when they told me the island was calling , in pajamas from the heat , but I dressed quick , went down to the desk , picked up the master key , went to her room , and knocked . There was no answer . I went in and she was n't there . I was worried twice as bad as Mrs. Legg was , because I knew there could be an answer I hated to think about . I began looking for a note or something , but did n't find anything . Her things were all in order , dresses in the closet , panties in the bureau , algebra book on her night table . Under that , when I picked it up to make sure nothing had been slipped in with it , was my picture , one I did n't know she had , that she must have swiped from Margaret , taken in the Little Lord Fauntleroy suit when I was about her age . It was face down . I checked with Tolan , the house detective , for what little he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were up there in about an hour , and put police and private detectives and God knows who-all to work on it . Around seven , when I was trying to stuff something to eat in me , in the dining room , Margaret came in . " I could n't face a night on that island alone , so I took the bus . " pI09 " Be pretty rugged at that . " " Are n't you glad to see me ? " " Yeah , sure . " " But what 's all the fuss about that brat ? Ca n't she even go to a picture show or take a car ride or whatever she 's done without practically putting bloodhounds on her trail ? " " They 're kind of worried . " " Well , are you glad to see me ? " " Ca n't I be worried too ? " " What about ? " " I do n't know . " I was n't on duty that night , and around nine I went to my room . By that time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting mildly interested . I sat there , looking at a sign go on and off down on Centre Street , and kept trying to think what I 'd do if I was a young girl and had woke up to the fact I was in love with a guy that I supposed was in love with my sister . And all of a sudden I had a horrible hunch . I rang information for the Finley number on the island , and called . If Dickie was there I was going to give a phony name and say how about doing a job for me with his boat . But I never got that far . The mother answered , and said he was n't there . " Do you know where he is , Mrs. Finley ? I mean , I 'd like to know when he 'll be back . " " He did n't say . " " Is he out in his boat ? " " No , the car . " Anne Arundel County is the beginning of Dixie , which is just one scrub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of it , forty or fifty feet off the road , in the middle of a clearing , with scraggly pine and oak and chinquapin all around it . ItpII0 was one of those log-cabin jobs , known then as a roadhouse , and what went on inside I did n't know , as I 'd never been to one , but according to Denny it was considerably more than the law allowed , whether it was women , wine , or song . I got there around ten , and the first thing I had to do , after parking , was see if the Finley car was there . There were quite a few cars out front , but there 'd be no trouble spotting it , because of certain dents . It was n't long before I found it , and from its position it had been there some time . I went over and rang the bell and pretty soon the slot opened and a piece of face showed . " Haya ? Can a hungry guy get something to eat ? " " We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Just a minute . " He went and when he came back another guy was with him that I took to be Zeke . I handed him some chatter , and I 'd probably have got away with it , but when I began spendingsome big Baltimore names I overplayed it . He shook his head . " Sorry , it 's just a little family place I run here , and we 're kind of crowded . And anyway , I 'd have to know you . Some other time , maybe . " The slot closed and there I was . I went back to my car and tried to think . I had no proof , had nothing , except this poundingin my head , that told me to get in there , and get in quick . But I hated to go off half-cocked , hated to have this kid that I 'd beaten up , that I knew was in there , see me looking silly over a twelve-year-old girl that maybe was n't with him at all . Then I happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as regular as clockwork , when she went in any place , that she 'd take out her wad and drop it over the side of the car on the ground . I went over to the Ford . I could n't see any gum but when I dropped to my hands and knees I could smell it . Then after I lit some matches I saw it . I went back and rang again and asked for Zeke and he came . When he saw me he acted sore and came out , the otherpIIIguy right behind him . " Listen , you , I told you once and I 'm telling you again  --  " " Just a minute , just a minute . " " Make it quick . " " I did n't come here for a drink and I did n't come for trouble . But you 've got a girl in there , twelve years old , and  --  " " You 're sure of that ? " " Zeke , in a polite way , I 'm asking you . " , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 'll be telling it to a judge in just about ten minutes if you do n't let me in there , so I can get her out . Watch your step , baby . Liquor 's one thing , and as we all know , it 's drunk in the spirit of good clean fun . But children , minor children , daughters of important people , are something else . My suggestionto you is , you ask me in , or you may be piling up more trouble for yourself than anybody you know can get you out of . " " Who are you ? " " Just a friend . " What the rest of it would have been I do n't know , because just then , from somewhere inside , was a scream , a girl 's scream , and then another . I dived for the door , but the two of them were there ahead of me . I got my foot inside , grabbed for Zeke , got his head out , and hooked a couple on his jaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something , I do n't know what . I must have gone out for a second , because next thing I knew I was on the ground , the door closing in front of my face , the screaming still going on . But then the screaming stopped and a door opened somewhere and I could hear a scuffle going on . I jumped up and ran off to the side , where I could see her wrestling with somebody , maybe Dickie . She broke clear , and somebody pulled Dickie inside . Then she was in my arms and I carried her to the car . " God , what have they done to you ? " " Nothing , nothing ! . . . Nothing , except try to keep mep112from going . I knew that was you out there . Oh , Jack , I knew it , I knew it . " Next thing I knew we were going down the hill to the Severn . I pulled off to one side and parked on the shore , and we sat there , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , that I remember . What did we have to say ? NEXT morning , when I was supposed to check in at the Cartaret desk , I was somewhere on the road from Gettysburg to York , watching the sun come up over the hills , with no more idea what I was going to do next than a grasshopper . I 'd been driving since midnight , when I set her down at the hotel , but where I went I do n't know , though I remember sliding around Washington , from Rhode Island Avenue to Wisconsin , so it looks as though I must have gone up through Rockville and Frederick . There had been no gay **27;3173;TOOLONG she got out . After an hour , maybe , sitting there looking at the Severn , we started back and she had another crying spell like she had had in the studio . I did n't ask her what the trouble was , did n't tell her what we were going to do about it , did n't try to hide it that I was doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and we both knew there was nothing to do about it . A man of twentytwoca n't go around with a girl of twelve , or marry her , or have anything to do with her , once he begins to notice what she looks like in a bathing suit , or she does . As we drove upp113Charles Street she asked me to let her out before we got to the hotel , and by that I knew she was going to cook up some kind of an alibi and not mention me at all . When I stopped she jumped out , slammed the door , and ran on without looking back . I sat staring at her , partly to see that nobody bothered her , partly for one last look , as I felt I 'd never see her again . When she turned into the hotel I kept on up Charles Street and turned west on North Avenue . But when I came to Mt . Royal Terrace I kept on going . When I got home , some time in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called down to me as soon as I stepped in the house that the hotel had been calling and that I should ring them right away . I said thanks , went upstairs to my room , and locked the door . Then I took off my clothes , put on pajamas , and lay down . After a while I heard the phone ring and then Nancy was at the door . " It 's the hotel again , Jack . " " I 'll call them . " " But they 're on the line . " " I 'll call , later . " She went and then she was back . " They say you 're due to work and wo n't you please get down there as quick as you can because they 're short-handed already on account of people away on vacation , and  --  " " Ca n't you understand English ? " She stood out there five minutes arguing about it before at last she went . I must have slept then because next thing I knew it was three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat . I put on a robe and went down and while I was frying myself some eggs Nancy came in the kitchen . " Well , my goodness , Jack , it certainly seems you 're acting very peculiarly . You could at least call them . They 're entitled to some explanation . " " I 'll get around to it . " " Is something wrong ? "  | " Just taking a little rest . " " From what , may I ask ? " " That desk  --  answering questions . " She flounced out of there , but in a minute , when I was at the table , tucking away the first food I 'd had since the night before , she was back . " Well , what do you suppose that child did yesterday ? " " What child ? " " The one you tutored . Helen . " " ... She been up to something ? " " She just up and ran herself away ! " " You do n't say . " " Mrs. Brems was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to Washington , took in all sorts of picture shows and the good Lord only knows what else  --  and did n't get back till twelve o'clock last night . " " I 'll be doggoned . " That meant Helen had put over a story , so she would n't have to answer questions about me , and neither one of us would be mixed up in it , together anyway . I listened to Nancy , all about how the police had been called in , and cracked dumb . After a while she went out , shaking her head over what young people were coming to , and I went up and dressed . Then I slipped out , before my father and Sheila would get home . That night , at least , I remember where I ate . It was in the Princess Anne Hotel at Fredericksburg , Virginia . It kept up three or four days . I 'd come in late , slip upstairs , and be in bed with the light out and the door locked before anybody could say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the Old Man went out , and then I 'd get up , shave , dress , and go downstairs . If Nancy or Sheila had anything to say , I 'd get interested in the paper , or stall somehow , and then I'dp115roll out my car and shove off . By the second day Margaret was calling every half hour and then she did n't call and then nobody called . It seemed to me , as I 'd told Nancy , that I meant to call her " later , " or some time , but later never seemed to come . Then her letters began coming in . She had a clammy way of writing , about three cap I 's to the line , with every other word in quotes and all sorts of stuff about how ideally we were suited to each other on account of both being so artistic . But clammy or no clammy it was easy to see she was suffering from the same old yen , that the family had the heat on , and that she was going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , my father was waiting for me . He called me in his study , where he was stretched out on the couch , and there was a highball beside him and a tray on the table . He made me a drink before he started .

" " Have you quit your job down there ? " " ... Yes , I guess so . " " What about Margaret ? " " I have n't seen her . " " Is the engagement still on ? " " I 'd say it was off . " " May I ask why ? " " I changed my mind . " " In other words , it 's none of my business ? " " The way I hear it , a marriage concerns two people .

" " I 'm free , white , and twenty-two . " " You 're also broke , or nearly so . " " I would n't bring that up if I were you . But since you do bring it up , we can go into this question of your responsibility . You had quite a lot to say about that once before and you may remember I had quite a lot to say about it too , all opposite to your idea about it . And the way you discharged your responsibilitywas to lose me every cent I had , that I 'd earned with no help from you , and that I 'd pleaded with you to let me keep . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no job that you can give me , no restitution of any kind you can make me for what your previous decision cost me , I 'd say minding your own business for once in your life would be a very good idea .

It surprised me , the amount of pressure there was back of it , but nothing like as much as it surprised me , the way he took it . He held up his hand to stop me , but in a patient , calm way , as though he 'd been all over that a good many times in his mind , and had maybe got a little further , figuring on it , than I had .

I still have hopes for it ! " " Go on . " " Of my own money , which would be partly yours now , and all yours when I 'm gone , I lost much more than I lost for you . I 'd hate to tell you what I lost . But am I an exception ? I tell you , we 're a legion , a host . We live on every block of every city and every town and every village of this country . And you live on every block . You 're one of a million , ten million , boys who must be cheated , now , because their fathers were fools . But there 's nothing to do about them . Do you hear me , Jack ? Some day they 'll have it , some day they 'll rebuild what was lost for them , but until then why stew up a corpse for the glue that is n't in it ? Let 's talk about you . " " All right , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage ? " " That I ca n't discuss with you . " " Is it what I think ? " " I do n't know what you think . " " Have you picked up some disease ? " " I have not . " " Do n't lie to me . " " I have no disease . " " Does the hotel irk you ? " " Possibly , but that was n't the reason . " " Have you rowed with Legg ? " " No. "  | " Mrs. Legg ? " " No . " " Margaret ? " " No . " " Then there can be but one reason . " " Which is ? " " Another woman . " I said : " There does n't have to be another woman . It could be such a thing as waking up to the fact you 've made a mistake , and do n't want to get married , and especially do n't want to get married to this particular woman and this particular job , and then bringing the ax down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's such a thing as grand , tragic folly . " " How would a fool know ? " That stopped him , but it sounded so mean and his face got so white I apologized , and he said it was all right and made two more drinks . But as I watched him it kept talking to me , a hunch that there was something more to it than he had said , something personal to him , and pretty soon I said : " What 's the rest of it ? " " Nothing , I guess , that concerns you . " " I think there 's something . " " I  --  had a deal . " " With Mr. Legg ? " " About the hotel basement . He  --  approached me . About the possibility of converting it into a garage . I went into it pretty thoroughly , figured what I could pay for a lease , made him my offer , and it was agreeable to him . I think he 's concerned , over that girl , to head her away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sew her up , and you up , and me up , as many ways as he can . However , it would be an excellent arrangement . I could put Kratzer in charge , and have a backlog , as they call it , that would carry my own overhead , and Legg , on his side , would do well too . " " " And ? "  | " He 's suddenly cool to it . " " Since  --  I took my powder on him ? " " After dinner , when I called him . " I felt sorry to be the cause of one more thing gone wrong , but to make a human sacrifice out of myself and go through with it anyway , knowing what would be facing me and the way it would have to come out , was more than I could do . I mumbled something about being sorry , and did n't go any further with it . All of a sudden he wheeled on me and said : " Jack , love is not all of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All right , but in every country except this one they give it a chance . They help love , with dots and dowries and portions and whatever each family can do in the way of the connections that make life easy to live and love worth having . In that way they at least escape the crazy divorce rate that prevails only in this land of the free  --  especially the recently free grass widow . I 've rarely seen such promising auspices for a marriage : a lovely girl , easy work , comfortable pay , beautiful quarters , fine connections , and the certainty that eventually you 'll come into a property as valuable as most men dare to hope for . " " I do n't want it . " " I hope you know what you 're doing . " " Anyway , it 's me that 's doing it . " " What are you doing , by the way ? " " I supposed it was something like that . " One afternoon , a week or two later , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles , but the spot I was in , the further the better . But around Elkton it started to rain , and a few miles down the Shore I started back . I ate dinner in Havre de Grace and got back to town around nine o'clock . But on Mt . Royal Terrace I noticed a big Packard that lookedpI20 like the Legg 's . Then I noticed the house all lit up , or anyway , lights on in the living room , which had n't been used that hour of night for a couple of years . I kept right on , and when I got to the park I took a turn around the lake to think it over . When I came back , instead of going down the street I went down the alley , pulled to one side , and parked . The garage was open . I went through to the yard and slipped around the house to the living-room windows . It was coming down pretty hard by now , but at least that meant there was no chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window was open , I leaned my head so close I could smell the wet screen and peeped . Mr. and Mrs. Legg were there , and Margaret and Sheila and Nancy , but I could n't see any sign of Helen or my father . Nancy was crying , and right while I was looking at her Sheila pulled a sofa pillow up to her face , stretched out and began to bawl triple forte . Then Margaret began blotting at her eyes with her handkerchief , and Mrs. Legg began patting her . Mr. Legg kept staring straight in front of him , shaking his head . After a long while my father came in from the hall , and from the way he wandered around , looking at pictures and stuff , I knew he 'd been taking a little stroll through the back of the house to think things over . Pretty soon he said : " Legg , I simply ca n't believe it . " " Neither can I , but there it is . " " But jack would n't  --  " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped around , with tears glittering in her eyes , she was n't very pretty to see . " Dicky saw them , I tell you . He followed them ! From that place he took her to , after she showed up down at the island with all sorts of wild talk about jumping in the bay ! Any idiot would know it 's been going on all summer . " " I 'm afraid so , Dillon . " " I see . " So that showed how Dicky had taken care of his end of it , but not what I was going to do about mine . Mrs. Legg beganpI2Italking about how peculiarly she 'd been acting all week , " ever since the Washington trip , or what she said at the time was the Washington trip . I knew there was something back of it , and I could n't get it out of my mind it was connected with Jack , and the peculiar way he was acting . " About that time Sheila recovered the power of speech and wailed that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What does the child herself say about it , Legg ? " " Say ? She ca n't even talk ! " " Well , she must have told you something ! " " Why must she ? After Finley came over , and that boy told his tale , she went into hysterics . Not even her own mother could talk to her  --  could you , dear ? " " We took her up from the island , to the doctor , and he took one look at her and ordered her to bed . I do n't know what she 'll say . The condition she 's in , unfortunately , pretty well speaks for itself . " " And if she admits it , what then ? " " I do n't quite know yet . " " Do you mean you 're  --  considering the law ? " " I have to consider it . " Once more I was slipping in the side door of the hotel , and along past the furnaces , and up in the freight elevator . Their suite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left of the little side hallway they had . I tapped on her door and right away heard her voice , and then she was there , in a little silk bathrobe , her hair tumbling all over her shoulders , and in my arms . " Jack , Jack , I knew you 'd come . " " Put on something and get down there . To the basement . " " Where have they gone ? To your house ? " " They 're up there now . Waiting for me . But how long they 'll wait God knows , and we have to talk . So be quick . Use the freight car and do n't be seen . " pI22 I went down and waited and after a couple of years the car gave a clank and went up . Then it came down , and at last she was there , and we went over to a baggage truck and sat down . " First , let me look at you . What makes you so pale ? " " The dark dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " Yes , now tell me . " " Well , the day after that night , when I 'd played hooky by going to a picture show , and then had the bright idea of traipsing me down to the island , and found them all gone , and then thought I 'd play a trick on you and went up to that place with Dickie  --  " " After deciding to jump in the bay . " " Well ? What would you have done ? " " Go on . " " After you came and got me and took me home , I had to have a story , something to throw them off the track . So I said I had gone  --  " " To Washington . I know . What then ? " " Then it was decided that it was being alone so much that had slightly unbalanced my mind . " " And they brought you back to the island ? " " Yes , things having suddenly quieted down . " " Why ? " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes . Today , just after lunch , it was threatening rain , and we gave up an idea we had , to go crabbing . Then Margaret went to her room for a nap , and Mother went back and began checking linen . Then Mr. Finley came over and I could hear them talking , from where I was , reading a magazine in my room , for some time . Then Margaret got up and went out there . Then I began to wonder what was going on and went out there , and from the way they kept looking at me I knew that whatever it was , Mr. Finley and Father were talking about me . Then Mr. Finley called Dick and he came over . "  | " And what then ? " " Mr. Finley had been telling what Dick had told him . " " Which was ? " " . . . That you had done something to me . " " Do you understand what that was ? I mean , what it was I 'm supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What did Dickie have to say ? " " He followed us , Jack . He must have , from what he said , because he knew exactly where we parked , there across from the Naval Academy , near the bridge . I think he sneaked out to his car , before we left Zeke 's , and pulled out when we did , without putting on his lights . And , in his own imagination , anyhow , he saw something . And when they began asking me about it , and Margaret began weeping all over the place , I  --  went to pieces a little . " " Then they brought you to town ? " " And called a doctor . He put me to bed . " " The worst is yet to come . " " How ? " " Your father means to have me arrested . " " For what ? " " Contributing to the delinquency of a minor . " " But you have n't ! " " No , but Dickie says so . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know what they 'll believe . " It was ten minutes before I got her quiet enough even to talk . Then we heard the watchman , ducked into the car , stooped down , and held our breaths . When he was gone we went out and sat down on the truck again and her hand crept into mine . It was cold as ice . " Jack , why did you come here ? Tonight . " ... To tip you . What 's going on . " " That 's not all . "  | " No . " " You 're going away ? " " Yes . " " You 're taking me with you ? " " No . " " Jack , please . " " It 's utterly unthinkable . " " Jack , I love you . " " I 've loved you since you were two years old . " " But not only that way . You love me more . " " If I did , it would n't be more , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you since I was two years old , too . I 've worshipped you . But not this way , as I feel now , until you undumbbelled me . That 's not so nice , to be the family simp , that ca n't do algebra factors like Mother or beat the piano like Margaret . Then you came along , and believed in me , and made me happy . Then life began . Then I loved you this way , so I ca n't even breathe when I look at you . Jack , you 'll have to take me ! I 'll put my hair up ! I 'll use lipstick and make-up , so I 'll look older ! Jack , I 'll die without you ! I love you , I tell you ! And you love me ! " " Not that way . " " Yes ! It 's why you 've left Margaret ! " " Listen , you . You 're to cut this idea out , get rid of it , anythingthat even looks like it . You 're to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they  --  " But she turned from me , curled up on the truck like some kitten , and started to cry , terrible little sobs that she 'd fight back and then could n't fight back . I got up , stumbled past the furnaces , somehow found my way out to the street . At the house , the Packard was gone and the windows were dark , so I put the car away and went in . From the study myp125father called . There was no light in there , but his voice had a rip to it and I about knew the thick cut he 'd have to his jaw when I turned on one of the lamps . But I was n't quite ready for the wild , maniac look he had in his eye . He was on the couch , and rose up off it like some corpse sitting up in its coffin , and stared at me , and began to talk . " You low , pervertedscut , to do a thing like that ! " " Like what , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say you did n't ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " I 've defended you  --  successfully , God help me . I 've made threats that at last have had their effect , and at least the police wo n't be called . But if you think I for one second think you 're innocent , you 're badly mistaken . I should have known it would be something like this . With the rotten , depraved blood that 's in you , to which something young is only a new excitement  --  " Do n't ask me how I got through the rest of that horrible night . I stood there , and pumps began driving in my head , like they had the day I beat up the organist , like they do still , at no more than a look in somebody 's eye , if I happen to think that look means my mother . I held on to the door jamb , for control , and he talked on and on , and every other sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to tell him what the truth was , but it was like talking to something insane , and after a while I wenx upstairs . Then while I was packing , Sheila came in , looking thin and old in some kind of a Chinese kimono , and I told her I was taking clothes and underwear only , and might have to write for the other stuff . She said she 'd send anything I wanted . Then she began to cry and I went over to kiss her but she turned away . At that I felt my face get hot , picked up my bags , and went downstairs . In the living room something moved and then Nancy was there with a thermos bottle and a basket full of sandwiches . She whispered the thermos had coffee in it . I thanked her and wanted to kiss her but hated the idea of somebody else turn- ing away . I put the stuff under my arm and went out . Then I was in the car , driving through the night , with the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more idea where I was going than the Flying Dutchman , and just as much chance of getting there . " THE future of football , of pro football , is right here in the South . With outdoor night sports the coming thing , a whole new field has opened up and pro football will claim it . I mean to take advantage of what the South offers . I mean to cooperate with baseball . I mean to begin where baseball leaves off , beginning the week after the World Series this October , and by using the ball parks , put on night games , not once a week , but seven nights a week , with doubleheaders if we skip any . But that 's the beauty of football : there 'll be no need to skip . Football is the one sport that never called a game on account of weather , that never gave a rain check , hail check , or snow check . Whatever it 's doing topside , the game goes on . If the customers do n't mind , the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Here in the South it 's always warm enough , and in a covered stand it 's dry enough . Once more , the South will find out it 's got something . " " You running the whole league ? " " I 'm running one team , here in Atlanta . " " But , Mr. Dillon , who 'll you play ? " " Chattanooga , Memphis , Houston , San Antonio , New Orleans , Jacksonville , and Miami . "  | " You 'll go into the Southwest , too ? " " Why not ? This is a pure matter of weather . Sure I 'll cross the river . " " Are those teams ready ? " " They soon will be . While I 'm promoting them and lining up backing  --  which is all in sight , my friends , I 'm not out to sell stock  --  we 'll challenge existing teams , and the way I hear it , the boys on the big Eastern clubs have quite a little time on their hands , and for a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down here and do their stuff for Georgia . And I 'll tell you something else . I 'm offering dates to colleges . For a nice cut of the gate and the fastest practice they 'll ever get , you may find those campus coaches will take a liberal view of ethics , if , as , and when they 've got any . " It was maybe a week later , in the lobby of the Atlanta Biltmore . I had called the sporting editors , and they 'd sent three or four reporters and some photographers over . And in hardly more than an hour there I was , all over the front pages , with big pictures of me , and big banner headlines telling how Atlanta was to have a team . Seeing it in print made it seem like in a week you 'd hear the referee 's whistle . How much of it was real and how much was phony , just a stall to hide the spot I was in , I do n't know . I had driven on to Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then after I caught up on my sleep , gone on to Raleigh and Durham and I do n't know what other places . All that time I was trying to forget Helen , cut out the bitter way I was raging at the Old Man , and figure out where I was at and what I was going to do . In Durham , I guess it was , I snapped out of it enough to cruise around to get a little work . I went to garages , because at least I could talk car language and make the things go . Some of the owners just laughed at me , some of them got sore for taking up their time with an idea like that , and some of them gave me a serious talking to . They told me to go home , if I had one , because there was no work to do . It was n't news ,  | but it showed what I was up against . I toted my money , what I had with me and what was in bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I had saved during the summer , after paying a couple of bills . And I had the car . I did a little more asking around , and then it came to me I better pull something , but quick . That was when I hit on this idea of organizing a pro league in the South , and as I write it up now , I do n't see such a whole lot wrong with it . I 've done plenty of promoting since then , and it does n't look even a little bit silly . I might have got away with it , at that , if it had n't been for one of the reporters , a little guy named Harmon . The day after the press conference I was reading papers in the lobby when he crossed over and sat down . " I rang your room but you did n't answer , then I saw you buy the papers . Thought I 'd give you a chance to look ' em over before I came up with my proposi-tion . " " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why  --  me , among other people . " " Just asking , shut my mouth if I 'm out of order . If you 've got all the backing you want , that lets me out . But  --  if it 's an open game  --  I might have a friend , Mr. Dillon , and  --  we 're all out to make a dollar , are n't we ?  --  I might have an angle . " " No harm hearing it . " His angle was to handle press stuff , public relations he called it , for my Atlanta club , and maybe later for the league . But his friend was what interested me . Because I give you one guess how much backing I had . I had put on a tall front , but beyond that I did n't have any backing , and it was just this kind of break I had hoped to get . Looking back at it now I 'm amazed I did n't go with it straight to the baseball people , on the basis of winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jack while I worked on plays . But I was doing it all off the cuff , and with this bird caught it looked like I had n't done so bad . And when he began talking about his days on the Wash/ington Star , and remembered stuff I 'd pulled in the Georgetowngames , and reminded me how two or three writers had picked me for all-American , I was plenty glad to listen to him , and let him take his time getting around to his friend . When he did he got mysterious . " You know a cretain soft drink that 's manufactured here , Mr. Dillon ? " " Why not jack ? " " And my name 's Harry  --  to my friends , Hank . " " Yeah , Hank , I know the beverage . " " My friend 's close to that pause that refreshes . About as close as you can get without glue . That gives you an idea the circles he moves in . But there 's a difference . That soft-drink dough , I 'd never want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough . " " There 's certain things that soft-drink dough knows about , certain things that show dough knows about , and certain things that sporting dough knows about  --  things you got to do , stuff you 've got to pay for , that looks plain crazy to other kinds of dough . Sporting dough knows , for instance , that you ca n't promote football with some guy sent out by the chamber of commerce that 's a shark on debentures , futures , escrows , and stocks , but nothing else . For football , you need a guy that knows football , and right there , Jack , if you do n't mind my being a little personal , is where you 've got inside position on anybody in this town that I know of . That 's why this dough I 'm talking about is going to be impressed . " " Who is this dough , if you do n't mind my asking ? " " If I told you all I know , where 'd I be at with my angle ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In due time you 'll know everything there is to know , but until then leave it to me . " " What time is due time ? " " That dough , right now , is on the yacht . " " It got a yacht ? " " As I told you , it 's sporting dough . The yacht 's off Nassau now , sailfishing , but on a radio from me they 'll break in onp130it . Relax , that 's all . See our city . In a couple of days you 'll be hearing something . But I 've got to know one thing . " " I 'll tell you , if I can . " " Are you playing on this team yourself ? " " I cracked a knee cap last fall . " " You mean it 's out ? Your playing days are over ? " " I mean if I could run a hundred yards in fifteen seconds now it would be a miracle . You 're not much good out there , you know , unless you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack . That makes me feel better than anything you 've said yet . Because a player-manager is just a headache , as every sporting man knows . It 's O.K. to play , but if you 're playing , play . But if you 're going to run it , run it . Do n't be causing jealousy and friction and distrust just because you 've got some idea you 're the only man that can score a point . Now I know it 's a natural . Now I can put in that radiogram what it 'll take to get action . You feel it yourself , do n't you ? " " If I did n't I would n't be here . " " Right . " That week , if I ever had any respect for newspapers I lost it . Once more , I ca n't tell you how much I meant any of this , of whether I thought something would come of it , or if it was just one last shot in the arm before I 'd have to wake up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed real , at the time , and of course by then I knew that on something of that kind , where promotion was it , you had to tear in with all you had , and put it in lights , with bugles blowing . I put out stuff so raw you would n't think anybody would go for it . Capone was hot then . I put out stuff denying he was back of me , and saying I 'd sue anybody that said he was , and they printed it . I put out stuff saying I meant to build a team that could play even with the best there was , I did n't care if it wasp131the Green Bay Packers or the Providence Steam Roller , and they printed it . I wired Red Baughman , that had played tackle with me in college , if he was free to work for me , and when he wired he was , I put out stuff saying the first player had been selected for Atlanta , and they printed it . I sent a dozen more wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they were free , I announced the " first eleven , " and they printed it . I put out stuff that the team would be the Remuda , and they printed it . Soon I decided to put out drinks for the reporters , and that meant a suite , as they would n't serve it downstairs . The bellboy took nine dollars a bottle for the liquor , with fifty cents tip . Almost before I knew it the cash in my pocket was down to silver , and I had to eat chili till my check cleared for a hundred dollars . All sorts of people were calling me by then : real-estate men , trying to sell me anything from a farm , to make a park out of , to a house to live in ; insurance men , to write coverage for the team , on some kind of group plan ; sporting-goods salesmen , to quote prices on uniforms ; concession men , to talk about soft drinks , hot dogs , and programs ; and forty guys wanting jobs , anything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but soon I made use of them , anyway to look big . I 'd sit around the lobby , on purpose not near a phone , and of course when the girl could n't get me she 'd have me paged . It got so that " Mr. Jack Dillon , of the Atlanta Remuda , " was going off every minute and a half . It cost a dime a throw for the bellboys , but I figured it was worth it . Hank called me three , four , and five times a day , and when he was n't calling me he was dropping around . Then one night the phone rang , and he was on the line . " Well , Jack , what did I tell you ? Boy , are you going to feel good . O.K. , here goes , word for word  --  it 's addressed to me here at the paper and it says :  | DO N'T TELL ME ABOUT DILLON I SAW HIM TWO YEARS AGO IN THE GAME WITH NAVY THREE YEARS AGO AT NEW HAVEN AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CLEANEST GUYS IN THE GAME HOLD HIM THERE FOR ME AND AS SOON AS MY ENGINE TROUBLE IS FIXED I 'LL BE IN STOP TELL YOURSELF HELLO . Is that saying it , Jack ? Ai n't that one swell guy and do n't it make you feel good ? " " It 's just great . " " I told you , hold everything . " " I 'm playing it just like you say . " Within the next three days there were four more wires , each one better than the last . But when I found out the engine was a tug job into Nassau , I began to get worried , because my money was going fast . One night when he called I said : " Hank , I got an idea that makes sense . " " Boy , let 's hear it . " " While he 's getting his boat in shape , why do n't I jump in the car and take a swing around to Memphis and New Orleans and as many places as I can before he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to tell him . I 'll keep in touch , and  --  " " That 's it ! That 's it ! " " I 'll line it up , and then  --  " " It 's ready . " I do n't think I said one thing to Hank the whole time that was going on that he did n't say it was great , and I guess I was beginning to notice it , that he was what you might call unusuallyoptimistic . But , as I 'm telling you , I'In not sure any of it was more than a jumbo stall . Nothing about it seemed real , from all those zanies trying to sell me stuff , and kidding themselves as much as I was kidding them , to those players wiring they were free and would be proud and happy to play under me as manager , and kidding themselves there 'd be somethingp133on the fire pretty soon . But the main thing now was , I had to get out of that hotel , and at the same time I had to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back as soon as I got other stuff out of the way that was important . I packed what I 'd need in one bag , left the other at the check room , and checked out . I went to a little dump on the north end of town , with some name like the Rosemary Cottage , that charged a dollar a night and wanted it in advance , and took a room . Then I began cruising around Georgia , going to every town there was : Augusta , Athens , Rome , Milledgeville , Decatur , just to name a few , looking for work . I went to every garage there was , and everywhere was the same answer : if they could , they would , and glad to do it ; but every one of them had laid men off , and if there was any hiring to be done , the laid-off men had to come back . Then I began going to hotels . I do n't like the hotel business , and I hated anything that might mean a query @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It got me nowhere . One man , at the Dixie Hunt in Gainesville , it could have been , explained to me : " Brother , I hear what you say , that you 'll do whatever I 've got for room and meals and space for your car . The trouble is , there 's been just about three hundred guys ahead of you with exactly that proposition , and some of them are friends . I mean it 's personal . You do n't know what this thing is , or you would n't even be in here . It 's just about the worst that ever hit the country , and if you 're up against it , do n't let it worry you . Everybody else is , bad . " This , as well as I remember , was toward the end of September , maybe early in October . I was wearing my overcoat , which surprised me , as I thought in Dixie you wore shirt sleeves all the time . Anyhow , whenever it was , a political campaign was going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says in the history books that in 1932 we elected a president , but if we did I do n't remember anything about it . That 's something I 'd like to get straight . Later , when relief came in and all that kind of stuff , politics got to be everybody 's business . But in 1932 there was such a thing as being so jammed up with your own grief it did n't mean a thing to you . The band played and the band stopped , and we elected Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt instead of Mr. Herbert Hoover , but down where I lived , what we heard about it was nothing whatever . " Oh it 's you , Jack . " " Hank , what do you know ? " " Got news at last , some of it good , some  --  not so hot . " " Let 's hear it anyway . " " Another radiogram , sent me here at the paper , same as usual : BOAT IN SHAPE AT LAST BUT OF ALL COCKEYED THINGS GWENDOLYNCOMMANDED APPEAR PRESENTATION AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNTIL LATE NOVEMBER EARLY DECEMBER BUT TELL DILLON IF HE CAN HOLD EVERYTHING TILL FIRST OF YEAR AM DEFINITELY INTERESTED . Do n't that beat all hell , Jack ? " " Kind of louses it up . " " Gwendolyn 's his daughter . Spoiled , bull-headed kid , all she thinks about is riding horses and getting her picture taken with some kind of a duke . What could he do ? " " Then  --  better luck next time . " " Knocks it in the head for this season all right . But for next year , maybe it 's even better , as it gives us more time . You know what I mean , Jack ? This way , we 'll have our feet on the ground and can do it right . "  | " Right . " " You 'll buzz me on it ? First of the year . " " Right . " " I 'll be looking for you . " " Right . " Around November i I sold the car . It was a 1928 Buick , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $170 , and that 's what I had to take . I moved out of the Rosemary into a place out on Marietta Street that did n't have any name . It was run by a Mrs. Pickens , and I took a back room , third floor , bath on the second floor , at $3.50 a week . Meals I ate in a drugstore . Ham on white , with mustard , mostly , and coffee . I got expenses down to $1.5o a day , and figured that with the $16o or so I had left from the sale of the car I might last till spring , with a little luck , and by then things might be different . But before Christmas it was gone . " Two fifty . " " My God , the suit cost forty bucks ! " " Two fifty . " " Look , stop being funny . The suit cost forty , like I told you , less than six months ago , it 's hardly been worn at all  --  now make me an offer . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me my ticket . It had been wrapped in paper because at Mrs. Pickens 's I was a week behind in my rent and both my suitcases had disappeared . So one by one I had taken both suits , the good suits I mean , the ones I could hock , and carried them out as bundles . The first one I took to a second-hand place , and they gave me $2.25 . It made me sore , but I had to eat . The next one , two days later , I took to this hockshop and did two bits better . And still I looked for work , and still there was nothing to do . Then onep136day , when another week 's rent was due , I let myself in with my key , late , so I would n't run into anybody , and tiptoed upstairs . The door to my room was locked . " Mister , can you direct me to Terminal Station ? " " Keep right on down this street here till you come to the taxis all bunched at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't miss it . " " Thank you , sir . . . . And could you give me a lift on a ticket to Meriwether ? You see , I come from there , and I 've got the offer of a job , if I can only  --  " Some of them cussed me out for playing them a trick , askingmy way to the station when I really meant to mooch , some of them gave me a dime , one gave me a nickel , and one gave me a quarter . This last guy looked pretty sore , and as he felt around in his pocket I wondered what I was going to do if he changed his mind and gave me a poke in the jaw . But all of a sudden , as he kept glaring at me , a bus stopped a few feet away , and who should get off it but Hank . I felt my blood turn to water . After all the big talk I had handed out to him , to be caught here on the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I could stand . He did n't see me . I turned and ran . I never wanted a touchdown as bad as I wanted a good , big , deep hole in the ground that day . I did n't decide to leave town , or have some reason that made sense , or figure an angle that would take me to some other place  --  I mean , if you 've wondered why guys on the road move from one place to some other place , or why they think being hungry in Jacksonville is better than being hungry in Atlanta . I lammed out of Atlanta for the same reason I lammed out of a thousand places : I was just washed up there ,  |p137that  's all . Harmon was one guy . There were two hundred and fifty others , guys I 'd try to fool , guys it would make my face turn red to meet face to face , guys that had told me to scram , bum , scram , guys that had something on me , so I could n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slate that might be bad , but not this bad . So instead of deciding anything I just kept on going . I could n't run very far , because by now I was getting a little weak . I had spent my last buck for a flop the night before and something to eat at a joint . Then , with everything I owned on my back or in my pockets , I had started out to bum a feed . That phony opening I did n't think up particularly . At first I just put it on the line : " Mister , I hate to bother you , but could you  --  " And that was all . By then they 'd be gone . I had to get them to stop , somehow . I thought asking my way to the station would do it . I kept at it all day , downtown and on side streets , but not on any good street . I do n't know why you hate it , that a guy with good clothes on might give you a snooty look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for New Orleans , and every time I 'd hear something back of me I 'd throw up my thumb . Nothing stopped . Then I saw some guys standing across the Southern yards like they were waiting for something . Then a string of gonds went past them , and banged into some flats . Then the engine would unhook and go down the yards , and I tumbled to what was going on . A freight was making up and these guys were waiting for it . I thought , me too . If that 's how you go , that 's how you go , and I should be here on the highway wasting my time on cars . It was , I would say , about five o'clock in the afternoon , just coming on dark with lights showing everywhere and fog hanging over . I went down in the ditch and up the other side and began crossing tracks . The guys looked up , and it was too far off to see them well , but the way they stared said there was something funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light moving , and I guess I knew it was an engine , but as I said it was foggy , and you could n't see anything clear . Anyway it was over on the other side of the yards and did n't seem to have anything to do with me . Then came a clanking , like a bunch of steel rods dumped down on concrete all at once . I mean it went **28;3202;TOOLONG . Then something hit me in the eyes , a glare that blinded me so I could n't tell where I was . I knew then I 'd heard switches clanking from an electric control , so the crossoversmade a diagonal line across the yards , and that the engine was coming right at me . I staggered back the way I had come , but it went through my mind I might as well stay put . There was no way to tell which track the thing had been switched to , and I could be racing right into it . I crouched down between tracks and waited . It got bigger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of me . Then it went by on the next track , a mile high , its firebox breathing hot on me . WHETHER it was six months after that or longer I could n't be sure , but it might have been a year , because I was catching one out of Chattanooga for the South , and that looks like winter coming on . A guy on the road , he goes plenty of places most of the time , but when the leaves begin to fall he heads for the Gulf . Anyway , there they were , about two hundred dirty buzzards squatting on the ties , spaced out along the Atlanta Division of the Southern , just outside the yards , waiting to hopp139on . Hardly anything was moving then , so it was the first through freight in a week , and they meant to get out of there . Nowadays they 'd thumb the highways , and if a few ride the trains the crews hardly bother them at all , so they can hop one in the yards . But then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a lift , let them on a train , or give them a break of any kind . If they wanted out , they hopped a moving train , so that 's why they were there , waiting . Not much was said . Hobos do n't mix , they do n't look at each other , and they do n't talk , something I did n't understand at first , but was to get a clear idea of , later . Pretty soon , from the yards , came the cough of an engine , then three more , spaced out slow , then a string of quick barks that meant she was spinning her wheels , starting a heavy train . The coughs and the barks kept on , and then there she was , pulling hard , showing the two green flags of a through train , the one we wanted . Everybody got up . She began goingby and they began going aboard , on tanks , gonds , or whatever they could grab . Some refrigerators went by , or reefers , as the hobos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive , because the ice compartment is a pretty good place to ride . But then they began dropping off again , on other guys ' feet , and it was like cats fell on monkeys . A hobo , he grabs the front end of the car , because if he gets slammed , it 's against the side and there 's no great harm done . But on the rear if he get slammed it 's against the thin air between cars , and he 's almost certain to pitch down under the wheels , which is n't so good . It was just dark enough that these guys had n't noticed the reefers were coupled with the ladder at rear , so they had no way to get topside to go down the hatch . So they had to pile on all over again , somewhere else . Me , I generally picked a flat , and that 's what I did now . It 's easy to board and easy to leave , and if it 's a little open to the breeze you can help that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . I hated it , that I would have a system for such a miserable thing as life on the road , with a canteen on my hip , papers under my arm , and blue jeans over what was left of my clothes , but if you get cold enough , you 'll do what you have to do to get warm , whether you hate it or you do n't hate it . I took the front end , where there was a little quiet air , and spread my papers out , two or three on top of each other so they were thick , and lay down on one edge . Then I rolled a little , so they were around me , and then I was warmer . Then , on my head , I felt something cold . Then I felt it again . Then I knew it was rain , and cussed myself out for not grabbing a reefer too . There was n't but one thing to do . Ahead was a tank car , so I rolled my papers up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there trying to keep as dry as I could . Then , after some little time , the train checked speed . Then , away up front some place , I heard somebody yell . Then there was more yelling . Then it got closer , and I could tell it was guys on the right of way . Then we began to go by them , while they stood there and yelled curses , out there in the rain , the worst you could ever think of , at the train crew , at the railroad , at the country , even at God . And then I knew what the reason was : They had taken it up , here in the East , what they were already doing on Western roads , letting the mob hop on , as they pretty well had to , unless they were going to hire a private army to keep it off , but then , after they 'd run a little way , cuttingthe speed of the train , so it was slow enough for guys to drop off , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bull would start at the tender , and come back doing his stuff . Maybe you do n't believe it , that they 'd drop two or three hundred men off in the rain , with no place to go and no way to get there . Well , they did it just the same . It made your blood run cold , the things that were said , and your stomach turn sick , to realize why they were said , but however it made you feel , it was no great help when it came your turn to drop . I lay low , but the bull flashed his light , and when I didn'tp141answer his " hey " he got tough : " It 's O.K. , Bud , if you want to lie there , but I 'm telling you to get up and get off , because it would be just too bad if I decided you were some kind of a critter and began popping at you with this gun .... " When my feet quit stinging from hitting the dirt , I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know I 'm not the yelling type , and in fact it might be better for me if I did n't keep things bottled in me so tight . But there come times when you 've taken all you can take . By the water that was running off my nose , by the hunger that was gnawing at my belly , by cold that was creeping into me , I knew I could n't get lower than I was that night . I was a human coffee ground , washing down the sink . Pretty soon the yelling died down , and guys began pushing past me , slogging back to Chattanooga , some of them sobbing as they went . I started back with them , but then after a few steps I began to dope things out , and turned around . As well as I could figure , we were nearer Dalton by several miles than we were to Chattanooga , and I was taking a chance on it . It was just a small place , but it looked like , if I kept my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I might do as well , at least for something to eat and a place to flop , as in a bigger place . The train , I guess , rolled nearly a mile while the bull was throwing the guys off to where he came to me , so the bos and I were passing each other for at least twenty minutes . Sometimeswe 'd bump , and they 'd cuss , and maybe sock . But they generally had so little on the punch I did n't sock back . After a while I passed what seemed to be the last of them , and then the rain began coming down to mean it , and I jammed the papers under my jeans , so if I needed them again they would n't be so wet . Then I heard two guys talking , off to one side : " Come on , fellow ! You ca n't lay there like that ! You got to get up and  --  " " God damn it , I said let me alone ! " " But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If your foot hurts , then  --  " " It 's shot . And I 'm shot , and  --  " " But there on the ground , on a night like this , you 'll die ! You do n't know how cold it 's going to be ! You  --  " I made myself not hear it and went on . Off to the right there was rising ground , and I veered toward it to get out of the water in the path . I ran wham into something that sent me sprawling to the ground . I sobbed at how my toe shot fire up my leg , and jumped up and kicked at the thing . Then I went on . Then I almost ran into another one . Then it soaked into my head what I had run into . It was a couple of tool chests , six or eight feet long , with slanting lids on them . I thought of the guy back there , and how if he could get into one of these things he 'd at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to get on , or I 'd be shot too . But before I got to the path again my foot hit something and I almost died at the pain in my toe that time . But my ear kept giving it to me , the clank I had heard , and then I went back . I felt around and found it was an open box of spikes . I kept mumbling to hell with the guy , to get on before I died too , but I took a spike and felt my way back to the first box and slipped it in under the hasp of the lid and pried . The staple flew out andp143off on the ground . I lifted the lid and felt around in the chest . It was empty . " All right , grab his feet , get between them , and hold them so he ca n't kick . I 'll take care of the rest . " " I got ' em , big boy . Say when . " " What are you getting ready to do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go ! " I lifted him under the arms from behind , the other guy by locking fingers under his knees , and we swung him along , me shambling backward . When we got to the chest we set him down and I opened the lid again and spread out my papers , that I had dropped inside , so he could keep warm . Then I climbed in , reached over , got my grip under his arms again , and lifted . At last , then , we eased him down on something dry . So he 'd be out of the wet I climbed out and we dropped the lid on him . He screamed and yelled like some kind of hedevilinside a bass drum , and called us every name there was . At last we tumbled to it that he thought we were going off and leave him there to die . I said : " Well , what do we do now ? " " Search me . I run into him this afternoon in the jungle there by the water tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that raw place he had on his foot , but I talked to him and finally got it through his head that no real hobo would let a thing like that get him down , and at last I pumped enough guts in him to get him aboard the train . Then on the coal gond he got off a lot of wild talk about how his folks have a store in Sandusky and he graduated from high school and run a power shovel on a road job in Denver and then got laid off last winter and never was tooken on again , until I got sick of it . I said : Well , for the love of Pete , you and who else ? You think you got it all to yourself ? You think so , eh ? ' " But when I heard some bumping in there , and then the lid was shoved up and he stuck his head out , I was a little on his side , because if there was one thing I would n't accept it was the idea of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I said : " I got an idea . " " Yeah ? What is it ? " " Feel the end of this box . " " O.K. , I got it . " " The way I figure it , the lid and front and back and bottom of this thing are nailed to the ends , not the ends to them . That means , if we got inside there , and braced ourselves against the back , with our feet against the front  --  " " Right ! " So that 's how we did it , this guy that had helped me at one end , me at the other . We kicked with our heels hard against the boards in front , and in between we shoved . Pretty soon they began to give , slammed down in the mud , so at last , even with one guy lying against the back , there 'd still be room for the other two to sit facing each other at each end , out of the wet , but at the same time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffin , which I suppose it was , more or less , if you were shoved in there all alone . I sung out to watch the nails that were sticking up , and then I raised up beside Mr. Grievous , where he was still standing in the middle . " Now , my young friend , I 've had about all out of you I 'm going to take . There 's some kind of a bed for you here , and if you keep still and do what you 're told you can keep warm and even get yourself a little sleep . After that , when we get some light on the subject , we 'll see what can be done about your foot , and maybe get you to Dalton . Until then , if you do n't want a bunch of fives in the kisser suppose you lie down and shut up and give other people some peace . And while you 're making up your mind  --  "  |p145I  let him have it , not hard but hard enough , high on the chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " We eased down the lid , the other guy and I , put our backs to the ends , and sat there . It was a God-awful place to spend the night , but at least we could stretch our legs and pull papers over them , and we were out of the wet . " What 's your name , fellow ? " " Hosey . " It 's only now , writing it , that I 've tumbled his name was really Hosea . At the time , it seemed like Hosey , so I 'll let it stand . " Mine 's Jack . What 's his ? " " He said call him Buck . " " Pleasant dreams , guys . " " Same , Jack . " " Go to hell , you bastards ! " But the cold was knifing in and my back ached , and I thought if I could n't stretch out I 'd crack up too and maybe not last . " You asleep , Hosey ? " " What do you think ? " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you say so ? " We went out , shivering where the rain beat down on us , and I took my spike , and we pried the staple out of the other box pretty quick . But when we lifted the lid it was all full of shovels . " Shall we throw them out , Jack ? " " We and who else ? " " One hell of a job . " " Let 's go back . " We dropped the lid again but something fell over inside with a clatter . " Raise her up again , Hosey . We better have a look . " What it was , was a couple of buckets that had been used for cement , and then stacked one inside of each other . We went back to the other box and sat some more , but then something in my head began talking to me about those buckets . So I got busy . I went out , stumbled along , and pretty soon came to my box of spikes . I grabbed three or four in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wet as well as I could , I felt for the end of the nearest board we had kicked off the front , held a spike there . I beat on it to drive it in . I drove more thumb than spike , and my hand was all cut and bruised next day from the mislicks , but I got it in an inch or two , until with my finger tips I could feel a crack . I left that first spike sticking up , took another spike and drove it in the same way , along the line of the crack . I used spikes like a railsplitteruses wedges , and when I started in with the third spike the board cracked like a shot two or three times . Then I jumped out there in the rain , grabbed the two-inch strip that was splitting away , and pulled . It came clear . I started in on the next two-inch strip . " What you doing , Jack ? " " Breaking wood for a fire . " " In this rain ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . By punching holes in them  --  " " We got a brazier . " He helped , then , splitting up one board while I worked on another , until we had six or eight two-inch strips . drying under the lid . We took them over to the track . Then one at a time we put them under the rail , heaved up till they broke , then did it over again , until we had three or four armfuls of wood in pieces maybe a foot long . Then we punched holes in the buckets the same way we had split the boards , using one spike for a punch and the other for a hammer . Then we stuffed one with paper and wood , put the other one on top , and lit it . Then we had the one pretty thing we had seen that night :  |p147orange  light through the holes . Then there was the sound of wood steaming , then a loud crack , then another and another . Hosey looked at me , then took off some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . He was a tall , thin guy , maybe thirty , maybe forty , maybe fifty , with those queer , bright eyes old hobos have , that at first look friendly , till you see it 's the friendliness of a scavenger dog . But I took off my hat too and we warmed our hands . " ... There 's a snake under this goddam box ! It 's crawling through that knothole ! " " Buck ! After all Jack 's done for you I 'd  --  " " Hosey , he 's right . There is a snake down there , and the main purpose of the fire , of course , is to tempt and entice and decoy the snake , so he 'll raise up through the knothole , and then Buck can bite off his head , accomplishing the double objective of getting something to eat and obtaining snake oil to put on his foot and  --  " I was making it up as I went along , but Hosey kind of grinned , and I might have run on quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it some routine , I put my finger down the knothole . And when something touched it that was cold and soft and wet , I yelled . " Well , ai n't you the funny son of a bitch . Get yourself a kazoo , why do n't you , and play tunes at it , and then when he sticks his head up you bite his head off and squeeze his ribs for oil  --  come on , Jack , why do n't you laugh ? " " Starting up again , are you ? " " Oh , I ai n't dead yet . " With him jawing at me and Hosey looking first at me and then at the hole , I had to do something . I picked up a spike and went around behind . Of course , pitch dark as it was and wet as it was what you could see was nothing at all . But I lit a match , and it spluttered out but the flash was enough to give me the lay of the land . The chest had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it the ground fell away into bushes and grass , and it was a little gully , just a crease in the dirt , maybe a foot wide and six or eight inches deep . It looked like somethingmust have crawled in there to get out of the rain , but what to do about it I did n't quite know , and fact of the matter , if it had n't been for the razz I 'd just taken , I probably would n't have done anything . But I kneeled down and lit another match . Then the ground gave way , and before I could get up I felt it coming toward me , whatever it was . I heard a squeal , grabbed , stood up with him , and then went running around with him to the fire . Sure enough , he was just what my ears had told me he 'd be : a little piney woods rooter , as they call the wild pigs in the South , maybe three or four weeks old , kicking and squealing and biting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reach in my right-hand pants pocket , get the shiv in there , take it out , and open it . " " O.K. " " Hand it to me . " " Here it is . " " Stand clear . I 'm going to stick him . " I 'd never stuck a pig in my life , but there 's plenty of things you can do if you get hungry enough . I jabbed the knife into his throat , then held him by one hind foot and went over to the track with him , so we would n't have the blood so near . I had no more feeling about it then than if I was emptying a bottle . When he seemed to be bled I went over to the other shed , where there was a stream of water running off the lid , and washed him . I took the cup off my canteen and set it there to fill . Then I went back to the fire . I 'd never cleaned a pig either but I figured it would work like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down the belly , took out the gut , wrapped it up , all except the liver , and threw it on the otherp149side of the track . Then I washed him some more . Then I took the knife and cut the skin , bristles and all , off the four legs . I went over to the other box , felt around , and found a fork , one they use to fork ballast with . I laid it over the fire , so the tines made a grill . I laid the meat on it . Brother , was it a smell , when that shoat began to broil ! " Jack . " " Yeah , Hosey ? " " It 'll cook better if we section those hams up , so we got smaller pieces . " " Right . " We turned all the pieces twice , and when they were nearly done , Hosey began to talk : " Buck , our supper 's about ready now , but before you get any of it , I 'm holding a kangaroo court on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to do : First , you 've got to say you 're sorry , to me and jack both , for the bughouse way you 've been carrying on here , that 's beat anything I ever hear tell of , I think my whole life . Second , you 're going to apologize special to jack here , because he 's the one that 's done everything for you and that you 've got to thank for being here where it 's warm with something to eat on the fire , instead of being left in that ditch , to die . And third , you 're going to say please . " " Go to hell ! " " Ca n't you smell that pork ? " " You heard me . " " Do n't you want to live at all ? " " God damn it , have I got to  --  " " Hosey . " " Yeah , jack ? " " Feed him . " Hosey took the meat off the fire and I took Buck by the back of the neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any idea what he even looked like . Except he was so beat up , he was kind of a handsome kid , twenty four or five , with light hair and blue eyes and maybe three days ' growth of beard . He blinked at the pork , smelled it , then turned to me : " You ever shake hands with a damn fool ? " " No , but I would n't mind . " His face lit up with a friendly smile , nothing like a hobo at all , and he held out his hand . " I been watching you , Jack , and I 'll say please , but it 's because I ought to and want to , not because I got to . " " O.K. , Buck . " " You hear me , Hosey ? " " O.K. , so you say it . " I remembered my cup and went over to it . It was nearly full but I thought it would be a good idea to have something else catching water while the rain was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around inside for a can or something . Then my hand touched glass and there was a clink . I caught it and held it up to the light and it was a bottle , maybe two thirds full , but with no label on it . I took the cork out and smelled it and it was white mule , good old Georgia moonshine . I slipped it in my pocket , went back , offered the cup , and they had a drink . There was still some water left and I hooked the cup on the inside of the bucket so it was resting on coals . " Even if we got no coffee some hot water would go pretty good . " " Say , that 's a hunch . " " O.K. , Jack . " When the water began to smoke I took it off , Then , after I pulled the cork with my teeth , I spiked it with the mountain dew . I stuck the bottle back in my pocket , put the cork in , and tasted what was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . " Boys , try this , see what you think . "  | " Hosey , Hosey , the guy ai n't human ! " " What is it ? . . . Holy smoke ! " So we sat there , and sipped and talked and laughed and felt good and were n't coffee grounds any more , but men . YOU got three musketeers , and maybe it 's a beautiful friendship , but it 's a cinch to be a gabfest all the time , with one and two talking about three , two and three talking about one , and one and three talking about two . Through all the hunger and dirt and sickness and cold that we had the next few months , I 'd say the part of us that could still think was trying as much to understand the other two as it was to do something about the spot we were in . But mainly it was Hosey trying to understand me and Buck , and me and Buck trying to understand Hosey . Hosey would talk and talk and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the ways of the road , and just kept lousing things up for right guys that were willing to live and let live and did n't want any trouble . Like the way Buck always acted with the bulls . He never could let them call it like they were paid to call it , and shut up and figure it was all in a day 's ride . He had to cuss at them like he had at me that night , and a couple of times he landed in jail . It was pretty tough waiting for him till his five days were up , once in the Baptist mission there on the Esplanade in New Orleans , and another time at a lousy jungle on the riverbank at Alexandria , but I could n't quite get sore at him for it , even so . He yelled what I felt , and I did n't ever mean to feel dif- ferent , or come around to the idea there was justice in it , I did n't care how often I had to wait . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two pals , and you 'd think we had a date with Clark Gable out there in Hollywood , at a certain time on a certain day , the way he beefed and bawled and bellyached . He said Buck would never be a real hobo , that was the long and the short and the size of it , and the way he told it , you 'd think real hobos were some kind of an order , like Odd Fellows or Masons or Elks , but exclusive . And me and Buck , when it was Hosey 's turn to scavenge up something to eat , would talk about him , and this real hobo idea , and Buck could hand you a laugh the way he 'd take that malarkey off : " The real hobo do n't ever get in trouble with the railroad bulls , because if he ever got his arm high enough for a sock it would fly over the telegraph wires , on account the mulligan do n't have enough vitamins in it to keep the bone from coming apart at the elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grub , on account if he tried to sneak up on anything he 'd stink so bad there 'd be a hurry call for the department of health , and after the exterminator squad got done he 'd amaze hisself one day by waking up to find he was a bedbug . " And : " The real hobo always leaves the jungle like he found it , in shipshape for the next fellow , same as a tumblebug always leaves the manure like he found it , in shipshapefor the next tumblebug , so he can show the world he is a real tumblebug and not no goddam cockroach . . . . Jack . " " Yeah , Buck ? " " How that son of a bitch loves a jungle . " " To him it 's home . " " But why ? To a flea it could n't be home ! " " He likes it . " You 've probably never seen a jungle , but you may have read about it . I had too , and somehow got the idea there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , that once you got the hang of , would give you the chance to cook your/self something to eat , take a little rest , and have some sleep . Well , that 's a lot of hooey , because what 's there is nothing at all , covered with dirt . Picture to yourself a bank , a stretch of grass , a bare spot under the trees , sometimes a slope . Here and there , four or five or six feet apart , are gray spots that would turn out if you kicked them to be the remains of old fires . Off in the bushes are old cans , buckets , pans , or whatever it would be , some of them with holes punched in them and wires attached , to hang over a fire , but none of them clean enough to cook a meal in for any self-respecting skunk . Not so far off a ditch to use as a latrine . And that is the hobo 's dream of heaven , the free apartment house he 's supposed to flock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociability and relax . That 's what Hosey was always trying to sell us , except he never quite did . Well , why this place and not some other place ? Why not any place , if that 's all there is to it ? Buck figured that out one day : " Jack , you ever fish ? " " Me ? In Chesapeake Bay ? Sure . " " Me too , in Lake Erie . One time my three uncles all came to spend the Fourth of July with us at once . My mother bunked them down in the garage , and then they and my father decided to go fishing and they went , and took me along . They chartered a power boat and we ran out in Lake Erie and baited up and put our lines down  --  hand lines , on account there were too many in the boat for poles . And boy , did we bring them in  --  whitefish and perch . I never saw so many fish in my life . We came home with two baskets full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three brother-in-laws in the house at the same time . She fried the perch and put the whitefish away , some in the icebox , some in a basket with ice on top on account the icebox was n't big enough for them all . Next morning when she went to look , the fish in the basket were n't there , and by night we knew why . The rats had got them , and they were in between the walls . Brother , they stunk . So that was a summer , tearing out laths , getting the fish , and putting the poison around for the rats . At night , my father would check every tap and spigot and sink , screw everything down , and even wipe away drops . The thing is , ' he 'd say , to fix it so when they 've got to have water they 'll go outside for it and die there . With arsenic , the thirst is unbearable , and if you cut off everything in the house you 're all right . But God help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack , you see any connection between them rats and Hosey 's jungle ? " " I 'm beginning to . " " There 's just one thing you 'll find in them jungles , and that 's water . Some goddam fool put it there and forgot about it , maybe a tap to water the grass , or fill up his steam boiler , or wet down his cabbages , or maybe it 's a spring . Whatever it is , it 's water , and it draws hobos , like rats . You hear me , Jack ? Hosey 's a rat . " " He 's not far from it . " " When did you go on the road , jack ? " " Oh  --  year or two ago . " " Why did you ? " " Little trouble at home . " " That 's it , we all had a little trouble at home , you and me and a million others that are riding the cars . But do you know how long Hosey 's been on the road ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . The real hobo , you know , always has his papers in order , and he was showing me his registration card , for the draft or whatever it was . He got rejected , he says , on account of physical , but that card said 1917 . Nineteen seventeen , Jack  --  he 's been on the road all his life . Jack , do n't he ever work ? " " I would n't know . " He leaned close to me . " Jack , will we get like that ? "  |p155One  time , riding the U.P . out of St. Louis bound for Kansas City , or K.C. as the hobos call it , we got thrown off I guess eight or ten miles the other side of Independence . We 'd spent the winter in New Orleans , Alexandria , Shreveport , Port Arthur , Beaumont , and God knows where else , and it was a little warmer down there than some other place , but how they treated hobos was a crime . So , soon as winter began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring of 1934 . Pretty soon we slid over to the highway and began hiking for Kansas City . But we had n't gone very far when we came to a roadbuildingcamp , where they were doing a relocation job , with bunk shacks , and mess shacks and all the rest of it . So of course Hosey headed for the cook to see what he could mooch , and Buck and I sat down to wait for him . But then we noticed no work was being done . Mexicans were standing around talking , and off to one side three or four guys that looked like foremen were in a huddle , but no dirt was being moved , no concrete was being poured , no shoulder was being smoothed . Buck knew about road-building , and he kept saying something funny was going on . When Hosey came back he had nothing , and said everybody was sore , on account of the blacksmith quitting . " They 've sent to town for somebody to take his place , but right now they 're closed down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with roads ? " " Jack , I only know what they told me . " We sat there a few minutes , then Buck said : " I got it figured out , I guess . " " Yeah , what is it ? " " You see that bunch of stuff over there ? " Off to one side in a field was a ledge of rock , an outcropping with a face on it , with big slabs and pieces lying under that , and in front some machinery , with yellow dust all over it . " Jack , that 's their stone quarry . The thing out front is a crusher . And those boulders are stuff that 's been shot down and that has to be blockholed and shot and sledged before it 'll go into the crusher . That 's what 's holding things up . The blacksmith , he has to sharpen their bits for the blockholing teams , and he 's gone off . Without fresh stone for the crusher , there 's nothing for these mixers here by the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So ? " " Let me think . " So he thought , trying to figure an angle , and I did , and I guess Hosey did . And then I remembered the smithing course I 'd taken in college , something I had n't paid much attention to because I hated hot metal and the stink of the forge made me sick . But if I hated the smell of coke it was nothing to how I hated an empty belly , so next off I was legging it over toward the Mexicans , asking for the super , and when they pointed to a little shack near the mixers I went in there . " Hear your blacksmith quit . " " My blacksmith got fired , for being drunk , him and his no-good helper both , and if you 're some relation of his  --  " " Me ? I 'm a blacksmith . " " . . . Oh , yeah ? " He looked me over , from the hat I still had from Baltimore , that had dust , dirt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color it was any more , to the jeans that had been boiled in every jungle from Macon , Georgia , to St. Louis , Missouri , and to the shoes , a pair of brogans I 'd got in the Good Samaritan Inn at Columbus , Ohio , just before heading south . It was something , at least , that he could n't see the suit , inside the overalls , with the snags and rips and tears in it . I kind of bowed in a very elegant way , and there was n't much he could do but bow back , and then I went on to say if he 'd put me and my two helpers to work , by lunchtime I could have stuff sharpened up for him so he could start his crusher that afternoon and put his whole crew to work . By that time Buck and Hosey were hanging around outside , and he thought a minute , but one thing on my side was he had a bunch ofp157idle men on his hands , and every minute they did n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some penalty clause in his contract with a bonus for speed , and I could see he wanted to get going . " Of course , chief , I do n't kid you any  --  a bright hombre like you I would n't even try . Before we work , we 've got to eat . On an empty stomach we 're a little weak . And , while we 're filling up , I could be having a look at the stuff you 've been using . " " What stuff ? " " Why  --  your drills . Your bits . " " What for ? " By the way his eyes bored into me , I knew I 'd pretty near overplayed it . But I acted surprised , and said : " To see the color , how they 're tempered for the rock you 're busting . That is , unless you want some broken shanks before I see what I 'm up against . " " O.K. , O.K. " Just the least thing that sounded like I might know my business was all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , Buck , Hosey , and me , were in the cook shack , putting away sow belly , beans , flapjacks , and coffee with plenty of sugar and condensed milk in it , something we had n't tasted in months . I 've heard that when you 're starved for a while and then sit down to a full meal you ca n't eat anything . Well , if somebody tells you that , you can say I investigated the matter that morning and there 's nothing to it . We ate so much that even the cook went bug-eyed , and he was n't exactly used to delicate appetites . In the middle of it the super , whose name turned out to be Casey , came in with an armload of steel , %s " , i " , and i% " pieces , in lengths from a foot to eighteen inches , and dumped it on the table beside me . " O.K. , chief , that 's what I want . Thanks . " " Say when , Jack . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more on order . "  | " Coke ? " " Plenty . " " Tub ? " " Two or three or four of them . " " I 'll be right over . " He went and I had a look at the smaller pieces , the bits I mean , and they were just straight cutting edges , crosswise of the length of the rod , like a little square block had been set in there , cocked 45  --  . The edge was longer than the steel was thick , as it would have to be , naturally , if the shank was to follow the bit down in the hole , and on the shorter pieces quite a lot longer . The big pieces , though , the i% " stuff , really gave me a creepy feeling in the pit of the stomach . Because the end had been bulged out , then creased four ways so the face was like a four-leaf clover , then fixed up with four cutting edges , and how to smith any of it I had no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , then leaned over to Buck . " How do these goddam things work ? " " ... You mean you do n't know ? " " Come on , let me have it ! " " A guy sits on the rock . On the rock they 're breaking up , the block , they call it . He holds the drill , with both hands , against the stone . Then two other guys , three if they 're in a hurry , beat on it with striking hammers . Six-pound hammers , that look like croquet mallets , with handles about three feet long . The guy holding it , every time one of the hammers strikes , he turns the steel a little bit . They do it in time . Sometimesthey sing . It sinks down , two inches , two feet , as deep as they want . Halfway through the block . As it goes down the guy holding it pours water in , to cool it , and wash the dust out . When it 's down far enough the powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light fuses and duck . Next day it 's ready for sledging . " " How about these big steels ? " " They 're for the power drills . They 're used on the face ofp159the rock . They drill holes sometimes ten feet deep , maybe deeper  --  " " And they use steels that long ? " " Sure , they 've got to be . " " They made here , on the job ? " " Of course . " " How are they made ? Can you tell me that ? " " They got a dolly or something . " It began to come back to me , what I 'd learned in college , and all of a sudden I could hear Dr. Buchhalter , the metallurgist , ding-donging at us , over and over : " Upset it , upset it , upset it , you must upset it first , before you can make anythingfrom it at all . " Upsetting it is to take a length of steel , an octagonal rod , an inch thick or whatever it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the shank to a cherry red , then stand with it beside the anvil , hold it in both hands , raise it above your head , and bang it down , over and over and over again , until you 've bulged the end of it out so it looks like the rubber cuff on one of those things a plumber uses to clean out stopped-up pipes . It 's tough work , and if it slips or you do n't hit the anvil or something you 're liable to mark yourself up for life . But at last I understood what I was supposedto do , and when the super came in again I said : " O.K. , Mr. Casey , why do n't I get some of these small drills in shape first ? Then you can bust up the stuff that 's already shot down , set charges tonight , and in the morning send your sledgers in , so by lunchtime you have something for your crusher ? " " That makes sense . And be sure on anything less than two feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch to longer drills they slip down easy and we do n't get jammed . " " I 'll be watching it . " The fire had been started by the time I got to the forge , and I stuck four or five short pieces of steel in there , showed Hosey how to turn the blower , and stood around till they were cherry red . Then I picked one up , beat on it to shape it , thenp16o began hammering it to spread the bit . When it widened a little I 'd shape some more . Then I gave it some licks to sharpen it , and so far as I could see it looked all right . I held it up to Casey : " O.K. for size ? " " Looks fine . " Now I had come to the one thing I remembered right , or thought I did , from my college days , which was tempering . I heated it up again until the shank was red for about two inches above the bit . Then I waited until it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit in the fluid . It sizzled and I took it out . The bit was a hot , bubbly gray , like it ought to be , and the shank was just going from red to black . Then pretty soon here it came , the straw color I wanted , creeping down the shank , with the purple just behind . I waited till the straw was all over the bit , then I plunged it in the tub of water . I took it out and handed it over . " Try that . " They quit at four thirty , and set off their shots , so at last I could rest . We took a shower , all three of us , before checking in at the mess tent , and there was no hot water , but at least we got clean . Then we ate . Then we headed for a bunk and sat down for a little rest . For Buck and Hosey that meant a smoke . They had drawn cigarettes at the commissary , and I could see their eyes closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of hopheads in a Chinese joint . I lay back on the blankets . They smelled like disinfectant but they did n't stink , like the beds in the missions . They stink like feet and puke and sweat that 's soured . Around sundown Casey came in . " Jack ? " " Yeah , chief ? " " Feel like a little work ? " " ... So it 's just a little . I 'm shot . "  | " For overtime up to twelve it 's time and a half . After that , if it runs that long , I can make it double . Double time . I need drills . " " I left you a dozen . " " I mean the big ones . " " I ca n't do them tonight . I 'm too tired . " " Jack , I got to have them . If I can have some ready by morning I can start work on my face and have a batch of stuff shot down by tomorrow night and really get going again . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got them all working my gang falls apart and I 'm behind and it 'll be a week before I get them together again , and  --  I 'm in a spot . " " Plenty more men where they came from . " " These are Mexicans . That makes it all different . " " Let me rest . " " O.K. " So I rested , then told him he had to take on Buck and Hosey , and he said O.K. , and around seven o'clock we went to work on the big stuff . I cut six of the pieces in half , so he 'd have a dozen ten-foot lengths to start . I made Buck and Hosey do the upsetting , so I could save my strength . When they had a bulge on all the pieces big enough to suit me , I took a chisel and put four light creases on each bulge . Then I upset a little more myself . Like I thought , the splits deepened , and I had my four-leaf clover . Then I took the dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steel , and beat on it . I could feel it bite in . When it was in solid I pulled it away and looked . As well as I could tell the cutting edges were right . I heated and tempered , but let the straw almost flicker off before I plunged , as I figured on the big stuff , the shank could be a little softer . I made another , another , and another . Along about number eight Hosey cracked up . I thought Buck would kill him . " That goddam simple-looking jungle buzzard , even when a blower 's all he 's got to turn he ca n't do it ! What the hell good is he ? Why do n't he  --   | " Leave him be ! " " But  --  " " Stop it ! " We let Hosey sit , so he could run up his time , and I think he slept a little , there near the forge , in the heat . Wrestling the steels , dolly , and blower was more than a two-man job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got along somehow . By three o'clock we had stuff for the power crews next day . What woke me up , some time around four o'clock that afternoon , was the anvil . There 's no sound just like it , that clink-clink-clink , **30;3232;TOOLONG , clank-clankclank . Somebody else was working that forge , but it had no business to be anybody but me . I got up , showered , and dressed . When I went outside , it seemed to me the cook was awful friendly . " Si , si , senor ? Feel like some grub , yeah ? " " Who 's the blacksmith ? " " Ah , some goddam fellow . Who cares ? " But coming over from his office was Casey . " Jack , I got bad news for you .... This morning , after you turned in , this yap showed up from Kansas City . " " And ? " " I had to hire him . " " Why ? " " He had a note from the home office , and  --  what the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told what you 'd done for me and how it helped us out of a spot and all , but they got a waiting list too . Guys they laid off two , three , and four years ago they feel they got to make way for , if any making way can be done . " " Nice appreciation a guy gets . " " Boy , I hate it . "  | " ... What else you got around here ? " " Nothing . " When we hit for K.C. , with a little money in our jeans at last , the driver would n't let us on the bus we were so dirty . Up the line were three boxcars we 'd seen unloading , and it looked like sometime a train would come along to haul them out . We camped down there and Hosey found a crate and we built a fire and tried to keep warm . We saw something back of us , and pretty soon an express rolled up and stopped and we got ready , because that meant they were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . Pretty soon , maybe a mile away , we heard it whistle . The express began to roll , and the diner came in sight , with people eating soup , steak , ice cream , everything we had n't tasted in a month of Sundays . Hosey jumped up and shook his fist at them . " Damn you ! Damn you all ! Damn every son of a bitch in there , and your " Hosey ! Take it easy ! " " And all their goddam brother-in-laws and stepfathers that are keeping us out of a job . " " Tell ' em , bo . " " Damn ' em ! " That was one thing we did , unanimous , was damn the people in the dining cars . We used to talk how if it was us in there , and hungry guys were out on the road , we 'd invite them in to have a bite and rest their feet . We used to talk how we 'd give them jobs . We used to talk how guys had taken enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense , but you try it for a while , out there in the cold , with no food and no hope and no place to sleep , and see how much you like a guy that 's unbuttoning his vest on account he 's full from the meal he just finished.  |p164I  DO N'T know how it is now , but at that time Kansas City was a wide-open town , the only one , outside of the Nevada places , that was left in the whole country , any way that I heard of . So the day after we got there Buck came up with his bright idea . We were in a little hotel on Walnut Street , though in single rooms . There were three things I meant to do : get clean , lock the door on the whole human race , and tell somebody to do something and hear him say : " Yes , sir . " But he came in pretty often , and this time he camped on the edge of my bed , talked about how good it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Jack , I been hearing things about the town . She 's free , wide , and careless . " " Meaning ? " " They got houses . " " With red lights on them ? " " So how about stepping out ? Take ourselves around to one of those places and have ourself a time . " " ... That I would have to think about . " " You do n't like it ? " " It 's a new one on me . I  --  do n't know if I like it or not . I 'll have to let it cook a while , see how it hits me . " " Do n't you ever think about the red lights , Jack ? " " I heard about them . That 's all I can say . " " I always wanted to see them . " " We got all day . They do n't open till night . " " Oh , there 's no hurry . " He sat there and talked about spring being in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked I thought . I guess the man never lived that did n't get a prickle up his back when he thought about a house , I do n't know exactly why . Maybe it 's like what a guy told me once , in England , about the bullfights in Mexico : " If it was my own country I 'd be against them , and do everything I could to get them stopped . But when it 's somebody else 's country , and there 's not one thing in the world I can do about it , I go . They get me . And as to why they get me , if you ask me , it 's because they 're so horribly , intentionally , and completely evil  --  evil all dressed up in purple satin , with lace sewed down the side . " Something like that was running through my head , listening to Buck , but pretty soon I knew I was n't going with him . To pay a woman for what had always been kind of a dream was something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside me , that I would n't have wanted to tell anybody , and anyway it seemed a little over Buck 's head . So after a while I said : " Well , count me out . " " ... I 'd been hoping you 'd come . " " Little old for that stuff . " " How old are you , Jack ? " " I was born in i9io . " " Twenty-four  --  old , say , that 's a joke . " " How old are you , Buck ? " " Twenty-five . " " When did you go on the road ? " " Three years ago . Oh , I 'd left home before , so far as that goes . I started out when I was eighteen , to get me a job so I could get married . She was fifteen . I started on road work , got promoted to power shovel , and then came 1929 and the shovel blew up and the road job blew up and all jobs blew up . I 'd been home quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , but when I did n't have any job she started in teaching school , and then when I still did n't have any job she lost interest . Then at home one thing led to another and I blew . "  | " Change it around a little bit it 's me . " " It 's everybody . " " Getting back to the lights : No . " " Any special reason ? " " Might catch something . " " These places are inspected . " " They were , up to last night . This is tonight . " " Some things , Jack , you got to take a chance . " " Not me , I have n't . " He sat thinking , and seemed so down I felt half sorry for him , and remembered what I 'd heard once or twice : that one reason a mug goes to a house is he 's so lonesome he 'd give anything for a half hour with a girl and the chance to forget who he is or what he is or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Well , if you do n't want to go how about keeping me company while I do some visiting ? You know  --  buy some girl a drink , sit out the dance , but  --  be there ? " " Me ? Buy some tart a drink with dough that will mean another night out of the weather if I can hold on to it that long ? Besides , you ca n't buy a girl a drink in those places . It 's drinks up for everybody every time you call the maid , and what do I care for a bunch of stockyard cowboys and their sweeties ? They got money . Let them spend it . " " You mean  --  there 's ropes you got to know ? " " They 'll teach you . Take you , too . " " Jack , just as a favor to me  --  " " Buck , no . " " But I never been to a house . " " Me neither . " " But you know your way around , and  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while there was a knock on the door and I opened and it was Hosey , with a bundle . Of course he had n't come to thep167hotel with us , but hiked himself over to some mission back of Union Station , because if no real hobo would work he would n't pay either , or do anything but mooch . But it was all right , it turned out , for me to pay and him to wash up in the hot water I had , and that 's what the bundle was for . If you think I said help himself , just out of the kindness of my heart , you do n't know Jackie . I bawled him out for the filthy jungle buzzard that he was , told him I was n't going to have my bathroom stunk up like a mission bed , and said if he wanted to wash he could march himself downstairs , plunk down his money , and get a room like decent guys did . But he just sat there with a little grin on his face , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty soon Buck said : " Hosey , what you doing tonight ? " " ... Nothing , that I know of . Why ? " " How about going out among ' em ? " " Among who ? " " Why  --  the pretty dollies . " " You mean women ? " " Why not ? " " You do n't know no women . " " Do n't have to know them . Here they got women that 's so sociable you do n't even have to be introduced . They 're broadminded . They got whole houses full of them . " Hosey stood up and his eyes turned black and you would n't have thought he could dig up that much excitement , let alone care about anything enough to go on like he did : " Buck , I 'm telling you something , for your own good , right now . The real hobo , he do n't have nothing to do with women , of any age , shape , or kind  --  they 're out ! They 're no part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of women . In the first place , he ca n't afford it . In the second place , if he keeps it up , the kind of women he meets , he going to get himself a disease , and if he does , God help him . For typhoid or diphtheria or pneumonia or whatever else he catches , or a broken bone if he falls off a train , or anything of that kind , he can go to a clinic and they'llp168take care of him , the public health will , wherever he is , some kind of way . But let him get something like that , and he 's just out of luck and nobody 'll do anything for him . In the third place , sooner or later some woman he 's with is going to get caught by friend husband , and then God help him . There 's plenty of guys doing time right now for rapes that was never committed , just because some two-timing dame had to say something quick , and hung it on them . Buck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By then he was so hysterical he could hardly talk . Buck looked at me and I looked at him and then we begun talking about something else . Hosey picked up his bundle and went out . " Well , Jack , what the hell do you make of that ? " " It was real hobo talk , whatever it was . " " Is he a preacher or something ? " " In some ways , of course , it made sense , but  --  " " Yeah , but he looked so funny . " The next night I was in bed , reading a magazine , when there came a rap on the door . I unlocked it and Buck came in . He looked pretty solemn . I waved him in , shut the door , and got back under the covers again . He sat down on the bed and lit a cigarette . " Well , Buck , was she nice ? " "  --  And pretty . " " Then if you had a good time , what the hell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... I do n't get it . " " I do n't either . God , you wanted to think , now let me do a little of it . Jack , there must be something the matter with me . " " You mean  --  you 've got something ? " " No , something else . Jack , I could n't go in any of the houses , once I found one . That part was easy . I thought I 'd pay a taxi driver fifty cents to take me to one , but hell , before I couldp169even see a cab a cop showed me . But I was afraid to go in . I do n't know why . There was guys ringing the bell of a dozen places and women letting them in , but  --  I could n't get up the nerve . " " I 'm not sure I could . " " I thought about you , and did n't feel so bad , somehow . So then I went over on Broadway , to see a picture maybe , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were kind of cute and one of them looked at me and said something to the other one and I got excited , because she was a pretty little thing , maybe eighteen or nineteen , Mexican , but with color in her cheeks and not as dark as some of them . Another thing , she had on just a little cheap dress and coat so I did n't feel so bad about this suit I had on . I started to cross , but just then a bus stopped and the other girl got on . My girl , she waved goodbye , then went on up the street . But just once she looked back and I piled after her hell to split . When I got close I spoke and she laughed and then we were arm in arm and I said something about a drink and she said she knew a place and then we were in one of these new cocktail bars they got all over now , and she ordered a bottle of red wine and we drank part of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we took our bottle and walked quite a way , to some kind of Jimtown across from the yards , and went past Mexican shacks and then she took me inside a place made out of old boards and dry-goods boxes , but not too dirty , and with a couple of chairs and a coal-oil stove with two burners . We drank the rest of our wine , me loving her up all the time . And  --  that 's all . " " What do you mean , that 's all ? " " Nothing happened . " " Why not ? " " I  --  could n't . " " Did something scare you , or what ? " " Nothing scared me . Get how it was . She was pretty as a picture . She was small , with as nice a shape as I ever hope to see . And she wanted me . I guess maybe she could be bought , I do n't know . I gave her five dollars when I left , but it did n't seem she could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I think she liked me . But  --  that was all . I could n't . " " How long did this go on ? " " I guess an hour . " " And what did you do then ? " " What would you do ? After a while , from being friendly and laughing and all that , she just sat there looking at me , then just sat there . I got up and pitched the five dollars in her lap and left .... What the hell does it mean , Jack ? " " I do n't know . " " I wanted her , bad . " " You wanted the idea of a woman , bad . " " Yeah , but that 's the main part of it . " He sat there a long time , looking at his feet . It seemed a pity , much as it had been on his mind , that things should have turned out like they did . His face began wrinkling up . " What did Hosey mean ? " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Nobody could get that hot under the collar for the reasons he said were his reasons . There 's something else . " After our money ran out in Kansas City we swung off through Kansas and Colorado and then south , and everywhere we went it got tougher . I mean , on the trains they did n't bother you so much any more , because the big mob was gone , but in the towns they treated you like a polecat with the itch , and meant get out and stay out . That was on account of the CCC . It drew guys off the road all right , but at the same time it gave people the idea things were under control and therep171was no need to mooch . It was under control , if you 'd go home and get certified by your family , or establish residence somehow , to prove you were entitled to help . But that was somethingBuck and I would n't do , and Hosey could n't do , for reasons that kind of seemed to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , all three of us , in Denver . But when we found out the terms , having to go back home I mean , Buck and I backed off , and Hosey got almost hysterical : " It 's nothing but a stunt to get votes , that 's what it is . A guy ai n't no hungrier home than he is any other place , and he ai n't no better . But he 's on the books there , or can get put on the books , and if he affiliates right , he 's in . But how about them that ca n't  --  " If he had n't stopped so quick I do n't think Buck or I would have paid much attention , but when he went out like some radio that blew a tube , we looked at each other . Then we began to wonder if Hosey had done time , and if that was why he could n't get put on any books . And then pretty soon he began hinting around that if a man had made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to shove him out in the cold for the rest of his life ? Buck made a crack about work , but Hosey had a comeback : " Work  --  what work ? Sitting on the onion bed , keeping them bullubs company while they grow ? That 's all I see them CCC bastards doing . That and wait in line for the privy . That 's a sight for you . You want to know if it 's a government job you do n't look for a flag no more but only if it 's got a goddam green-and-white privy . What a country ! " He got pretty bitter and talked so mysterious we began to wonder if the Communists had got him . They were in every mission by then , telling guys where to go to hear the dope handed out . But then we began to tumble that Hosey was n't talking about Russia , he was talking about grub , and was nothing like as hot for the law and keeping out of trouble like a real hobo does , as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what hap/pened to me there , or did n't happen , as it turned out . We were in the Santa Fe yards , getting ready to catch out West , for Arizona and maybe even California , if we could hang on that long . The shacks had said our train would leave around nine , so we parked on a flat while the yard engines slammed it together . When we saw three work cars pulled out , we got kind of excited , because if one of them was open and had bunks we might be able to have ourselves a trip . As I was the one that had mooched the supper Buck and Hosey said keep still , that they 'd go see . So they went . It was quite a way , because the head of the train was half a mile away , so I got as comfortable as I could and began looking how bright the stars are on a New Mexico night . Then a passenger train pulled in . It made the station , then pulled out slow , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual against people that were eating and drinking and reading and doing things I could n't do . Then some sleepers went by , mostly dark , but you could see porters in there making up berths . Then a sleeper began going by that was all dark , and then the train stopped . I was paying no attention until all of a sudden , not five feet from my face , a light went on . It was in a compartment , and who had turned it on was a girl . She was blonde , not too big , and with one of those shapes you see on a magazine cover . She switched around in front of the mirror , turned and twisted , and looked at herself from every angle there was . Of*course that gave me an angle on every angle there was . Then she began to undress , and everything she took off she 'd flirt with herself in the mirror again , and swing her hips from side to side like a dancer does . Pretty soon she had n't one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she did then . Then the train began to move , and she was gone . " What do you mean it did nothing to you ? " " What I say . Nothing , Buck . "  | " Well , what the hell  --  with a window in between  --  " " With a window in between or a whole glass mountain in between , for a guy to see that girl , what she was doing , and not have any reaction to it , do n't tell me it was just a little case of what-the-hell . There 's something funny about it . " The work cars had been locked , but when the train began to move , Hosey stayed forward , in a sand gond that he liked , and Buck dropped off to join up with me . He kept calling my name so I would n't go by without his seeing me , but I was so numb from what I had seen that I almost did n't answer him . But I woke up in time to pull him aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened and what it did n't do to me . He figured on it a while , then said : " You 've forgotten something , have n't you ? " " Like what , for instance ? " " Me and my Mex . And Hosey , how he carried on . " " And what 's that got to do with it ? " " We just have n't got it any more , that 's all . That 's what he was holding back . That 's what riled him like it did , and got him so excited he could hardly talk . That 's why a real hobo do n't have anything to do with women . It 's because he ca n't . It 's not only that he stinks and they wo n't have him and he would n't even have the price of a bunch of flowers if they would , it 's because even if they would have him he ca n't have them . He 's gone . Well , who the hell would expect any different if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead , is n't it ? Sleep in some shed or tool chest or mission or boxcar or cattle chute , cold as hell , hard as hell , dirty as hell , and get the hell out before dawn for fear some bull will chase us . Shave out of that canteen cup of yours if we got any blades to shave with  --  shave every day with cold water , muddy water , any kind of water there is , till our face is raw or even got blood running out of it , because if we do n't shave we ca n't mooch or even bum a ride or stay on a train without we get run in  --  because a guy without a shave , he 's just a bum that any judge wouldp174send up after one look at him . Then mooch a breakfast , whateverwe can find , a bowl of soup with grease all over it or a bowl of grease with a little soup under it or six boiled potatoes from last night 's dinner or a cup of coffee and a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work the stem a while if we 're clean enough to go on the stem , and if we 're not , find some goddam jungle under a railroad bridge where we can bring a can and some water and boil up our lousy clothes and hang our stockings up to dry and knock the mud off our shoes and hope the cops have n't got orders to run us out while we 're sitting there naked with our knees up under our chin . Then into our clothes again and out on the stem again , and if we split it up right and Hosey finds a crate and you work the butcher shops and me the kitchen stoops , maybe we come up with enough for some mulligan , and if none of our stuff was rotten , we do n't get sick that night , but if some of it was , we spend half the night in some ditch before we start in town again trying to find another place to lie down and be warm and get some sleep . Next day we decide it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start all over again . You think that life puts anything in your bones that would be any use to a woman , you 're crazy . Glass , my eye . If there had been no glass there , nothing but a welcome sign , it would n't have done you any good to go in . Would it ? " " No . " In Phoenix we washed dishes in some restaurant for something to eat , and then Hosey went on back to a shed they had in the back yard , with gunny sacks piled up in it , where they said we could sleep . But Buck walked on over to a gully beyond the fence , and sat on a rock , and I could see him staring at the traffic that was going by on 80 . Pretty soon I went out there with him . He was pretty glum : " Some life , Jack . "  | " Bad as it can get . " " Worse than I knew it could ever get . " " I 'll go that far too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " If I knew , pal , I 'd tell you quick enough . " We sat there a long time , and then my head began to pound . " Yeah , Jack , what is it ? " " Really , you 're still talking about one thing . What I found out through the glass , and you with your Mex . " " If it was n't for that , Jack  --  " " I could put up with the rest of it . " " Come on , let 's have it . " " Buck , the sleep part , we can manage , specially out here in the Southwest , where it 's warm , and at this time of year , when almost anywhere is a place to sleep . The rest of it 's grub . All right , get this : What we 've lost , what we have n't got any more , I mean to get back . I do n't mean to turn into just a thing , like Hosey is . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack , that 's what I want to hear . But how ? " " I 'm going to take it . " " The grub ? " " You 're goddam right . " " You think you 're doing it alone ? " " Then we 'll both do it . " " Jack , we got it coming to us . " " All right , then we got it coming to us . But I 'm going to eat , whether we got it coming to us or not . Now if you want to come in  --  " " Jack , shake just once and shut up . " We sat out there till the traffic did n't run any more , and you could hear birds warbling , and talked about how we were going to do it . By that time we knew where the grub was and how to get it and a whole lot of things nice people do n't know , but guys on the road do . The only difference was , would we or would n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , what we were figuring on , took three , because we 'd be all day and all night getting a meal , if two guys had to spot a place , watch their chance , steal the grub , and then have to mooch a can to cook it in and wood to cook it with . We had to have two stealing and one mooching , and that meant on the jungle end of it we had to have Hosey , but we had one sweet time selling him . We argued for two days about it . But there we were , still washing dishes and stacking and shoving ice and barrels around this dump in Phoenix , and nowhere to go but out , soon as three guys showed up that they liked better . And there were those trucks going by all the time , full of CCC guys yelling at us , and I think that was what finally got Hosey . Anyway , out of a clear sky one afternoon , sitting by the side of the road , he said O.K. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and telling us what we had to do if we were going to get away with it , and he had it down so pat you could n't help wondering if he was n't kind of a postgraduate recruit . The main thing , he said , was to keep it small , so to begin with the cops did n't take any interest in the job even if it was reported . The next thing was to confineit to food , because three guys filling their bellies was one thing , but three crooks really stealing would be something else . The next thing , he said , was to get the lay of every job before we pulled it , so we 'd be in and out and gone before they even knew we 'd been there . The last thing was : Do n't be too proud to run . All that was about the way Buck and I had figured it , butp177we still thought Hosey ought to be in charge of the mooch department , and fires and cans . He thought so too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we were going to do our cooking , and Buck and I slid out to the west end of town , where we were going to do our stealing . Under our shirts , when we said goodbye to the restaurant man and his wife , were a couple of gunny sacks we neglected to mention to them . Out Van Buren Street is a bunch of motor courts and hotels , and not far from them two or three cafes for tourists , and not far from them some stores . As to whether we 'd raid the restaurantpantries or the stores we had n't quite made up our mind , and we were going to be guided mainly by how things looked when we got there . And we no sooner walked up the street than we knew what the answer would be : one of the stores . And why it suited us was that it had no second floor or bedroomsof any kind connected with it . It looked like when they closed it they left it , and we 'd have it to ourselves if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglar alarm we meant to run , but at the same time it did n't scare us a whole lot . We 'd heard plenty of burglar alarms , the time we 'd been on the road , and if anything was ever done about any of them it was n't while we were there . So that danger we disregarded and had a walk around the block and checked on the little dirt road in back , that ran past all the stores for the delivery of stuff , and marked our place by counting the back doors . In the back window were bars running across , and at the side of the back door what looked like an iron grill , folded up . That was O.K. We figured on stuff like that , and were ready for it . Then we went off to take it easy so we would n't be dead on our feet when the time came to go in there . We did n't at any time hang around , or stop and take long ganders , or attract attention in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we were headed somewhere , and when we came to a corner we turned it sharp , like we knew where we were going and meant to get there . Just the same , by dark we had it all , and found a place we could stand and watch . By eight o'clock lights began going out in the motor courts , by nine our place was dark , by ten the restaurants were closing , and all you could hear was radios in the bars . " O.K. , Buck , it 's time . " " It 's now if we 're going to . " " I 'll take your spike . " We had remembered those railroad spikes the first night , what we 'd been able to do with them , and got ourselves one . We figured it was as good as a jimmy . We slid down Van Buren and then into the cross street , to take a flash at the alley . We did n't see anything . Then I stood by the alley and he went back to Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , smoothed his hair , began walking back and forth like he was waiting for a bus . The hat meant all clear . I went down the alley , turned in back of the store , got out my spike . By now the iron lattice was in place , with two padlocks holding it , top and bottom , and I meant to break them , if I could . But first I had a look at the bars on the window , and felt them with my thumb . You could hardly believe it , but all that was holding them was screws . I mean , the end of each bar had been flattened and an eye punched in it , and the screw driven in through that . On my jackknife was a screw driver , small but stubby and strong . I opened it up and shoved it against one of the screws . It turned . In about five minutes I had the three lower bars off . I tried the window . It was locked . I jammed the spike between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window andp179stepped in . My bowels were fluttering and I wondered if the lights would snap on and a face behind *a gun tell me to put them up and keep them up . Then somewhere in the distance a bell began ringing . It stopped . I got myself under control and looked around . It was just a little store , with canned stuff , open crates with vegetables and fruit , and packages of stuff like crackers . I could see well enough , by the light from the street , so I got out my sack , where it was folded against my stomach , and went to work . The first thing that was wanted , what Buck and Hosey talked so much about , was chicken . They wanted the boiled chicken that comes in a wedge-shape can , and I began hunting for it . I was in the place altogether , Buck told me later , exactly twenty-five minutes , by a clock on Van Buren Street . But if I tell it like I remember it , I was in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often where they were executing somebody back of the little green door , feet tramping over my head , where the trusties were marching in from the farm , and me there in my dark little cell with bars over the window , getting a little stir-happy by now on account of the time I 'd served . After ten or fifteen years I thought to hell with chicken , drop something in the sack and get out . I grabbed cans of beans , mock turtle soup , even beets , on top of raw potatoes , oranges , bread , soap , anything . Then all of a sudden it was like a football game , with the first quarter nearly up , the flutters gone , and my mind clicking . My hands began reaching for exactly what I ought to have , I took three chickens in cans , then peas , carrots , and corn . I took pears , for dessert . I found the icebox and dropped butter in . I took a quart of milk and another of cream . There were special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . I looked for razor blades , found a whole box , dropped that in . My thumb snagged a beer opener . I dropped that in , began looking for beer , found it , dropped a dozen cansp18o in . I found instant coffee , condensed milk , and a sack of sugar , and dropped them in . I found a sack of salt and dropped that in , and a can of pepper . All that I did so fast I 'd breathe and then not breathe , but pretty soon I knew I was done and started for the window . Then I saw the cash register . All that stuff about taking only food ran through my head , and even while it was running I dumped the sack on the floor and reached for my spike . I jammed it in a crack and bore down and something popped . I yanked open the drawer . It was empty . I began growling curses like a wild man . I picked up the sack again and started out and then my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly anybody would see unless they 'd worked around some business place like a garage . I tried it and it was locked . I jammed the spike in and nothing gave . I reached under for keys . You do n't see them when the storekeeper makes change , but they 're there just the same , four or five or six finger taps that work on springs and have to be pressed in combination before the lock releases . On this drawer there were six , and that meant probably a three-key combination . I tried 1-2-3 , 1-3-4 , 1-4-5 , and 1-5-6 , and inside of me somethingkept yelling to get out and get out quick , but my fingers kept working the combos and my head kept ticking them off , so I would n't waste time trying one twice . I started the twoseries . The drawer pulled open and I saw steel . It was a metal box , and it was locked . I set it up on its edge , held the spike on the lock , and used a box opener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a snap and the lid was off . Inside was money . I could see ones and fives and tens , but I did n't stop to count and did n't take the silver . I stuffed the bills into my pocket , picked up the sack , and stepped out the window . I closed it , then looked around . I did n't see anything , slippedp181into the alley , and down to the cross street . On Van Buren , Buck was still there , waiting for his bus . I waved and he ran toward me . " God , Jack , I thought you 'd never come . " " Had to find stuff . " " Gee , you 're loaded . We better split it , so we can make time . " " Not here . Let 's hit for the river . " " O.K. Come on . " The river is one of those Western jobs , ten parts sand and rock and gravel to one part water , but it was n't too rough , and we figured we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet anybody . We hit it in a half hour and began looking for Hosey . He was to light up a fire , so we 'd have a torch to steer by . But we walked and walked and routed up about forty things that rustled and hissed and scrabbled , and still nothing but black ahead . " Jack . " " Yes , Buck ? " " Did he say upriver ? " " Not once but twenty-eight times . " " Does the bastard know upriver from down ? " " Well , feel the water ! You can feel how it  --  " " Yeah , Jack , I can and you can . But can he ? " I 'd say we went two miles , feeling like twenty . And we saw a flicker of yellow , and then we could hear him : " Yay Jack , yay Buck ! " " . . . Well , why did n't you pick Alaska ? " " It 's perfect . It 's a  --  jungle ! Look over top of you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad went over the river . That it was worth two miles of walking , by the dark of the moon , I could n't see , but I did n't argue about it . He had cans , big ones , for boiling , and little ones , to eat out of , and plenty of wood . We fed up the fire , set water on to heat , and pretty soon put the chicken , soup , peas , and other stuff in , still in the cans . Then in one can I made coffee . When I put that instant stuff in , with sugar and cream , they began gulping it without even waiting for the other stuff . Then we opened the soup and drank a can apiece . Then we had the chicken , but one can was all we were able to get away with . Then we had peas , carrots , and corn , and canned peaches . Then I broke out what I had n't said anything to them about . That was the beer , that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took one look at those cans and began mumbling those cusswords that are little prayers of thanks in tough guys ' language . I cut into three , and we sat there with the foam sliding all over our mouths , and the cold beer sliding down our throats . Buck began to mumble how they both owed plenty to me . Hosey said they sure did . I said thanks , pals , thanks . By then it was daylight , so when a train came along we slid out from under to have a look at her . She was a passenger train , westbound , all curtained in , but on the observation platform , smoking a cigar , in pajamas , dressing gown , and slippers , was a fat guy . We waved , and he stared , like he could n't believe his eyes . Then he leaned forward , held on to the brass rail , and spit at us . " ... That dirty son of a bitch . " " O.K. , Buck , tell him some more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? First they throw you out , then they spit in your goddam eye . That fat slob ! No , not one of the three of us would get like that . At least we 'd give a guy a break . At least if he waved at us we 'd wave back . But that fat bastard could n't even give us a wave . Not even a kind look . " We went back to the fire and began talking what we 'd do if we had it good and three guys off the road came in andp183asked for a break . We said we 'd feed them and bed them down till they were ready to talk and then line it up for them to get a job . In the middle of that Buck took off his coat , crawled inside his gunny sack , stuck the coat under his head and went to sleep . Then Hosey did . Then I did , or tried to . But all the time the beer and chicken and the rest of it were taking me down I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything about it . It seemed to me I was as close to them as brothers . And yet I was mortally afraid to open my trap about it . Around noon we built up more fire , heated some beans , made some coffee , filled ourselves with all we could hold , and then began to boil up . I boiled everything , even my suit . What to do with the money I did n't know but I climbed the bank , stuck it in an angle of the abutment , put a stone over it , and came on back . We worked on ourselves , first in the cold water in the river , then in the hot that we kept boiling , until we were pretty clean . The soap came in as handy as anything , and we took turns with it , scrubbing and slopping and latheringwith it , until it was just a sliver and then even that was gone . Around four maybe , our clothes were dry and we got dressed . But along toward sundown dogs began barking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobo hates worse than work it 's dogs . Hosey began to get nervous and it was easy to see if we were going to keep him we had to move . We talked about where we 'd move to , and he was scared to death to go through Phoenix again on a train , as he said they 'd " be laying for us , sure . " And yet we all wanted to beat West , instead of going back East , on account of the weather . Finally we decided to break up , each one to hitchhike separately by road , and meet again in Shorty Lee 's jungle in Yuma , that Hosey said was the best in the U. S. , bar none . So that 's whatp184we did . We had to break up , because three guys together would scare any private driver to death , and on the trucks , on account of a new no-rider clause in the insurance , there was no chance at all . There had been trouble , hijacking and stuff like that , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard , all bets were off . Kind of rugged for Mr. Thumb , but it gives you an idea how things were . Me , though , I caught a through bus . The driver looked at me funny , but I knew I did n't stink so I looked right back , and when I got out my roll that talked . It was a day coach , not very full , so there was plenty of room on the wide seat at the rear . I stretched out , got comfortable , and counted my money . There were two or three tens , some fives , and the rest ones , altogether around ninety dollars . I shoved it in my pocket again , then sat there , staring out at the road where it was rolling out behind , working on something that had been bothering me all day : Why had I hid that money ? Why had n't I said something about it to Buck and Hosey ? Why had n't I cut them in ? Here they were , maybe not the buddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed up in a dinner coat three years before , but some kind of buddies , and what was pretty important too , all the buddies I had . And yet , at my first stroke of luck , I had ratted on them one hundred per cent , like any real hobo . I began thinking about something else : Why had I passed up the silver ? So nobody could hear it clink , seemed to be the answer . Yeah , but who ? A cop , when I was toting that sack , if he ever got near enough to hear somethingclink , would already have nabbed me . Once more , it spelled Buck and Hosey . And at last I admitted to myself , what had been slewing around in the back of my head : I had kept quiet , I had even passed up the silver , because I was afraid of them . On food , as Hosey had said , there 'd be nothing to tell . At most it would be thirty days in jail , or more likelyp185ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money was different . Buddies or no buddies , rat or no rat , I 'd never put myself in their power by letting them in on it . Or at least so it seemed at that time . Shorty Lee , the hobo 's friend , had fixed up a jungle that was a lulu , all right , and though I would n't exactly trade off my membership in the University Club to get into it , it did things to you that somebody had put up a couple of shacks that guys could sleep in , got them some clean pots to cook in , bricks for their fires , and connected up a shower so they could get clean and a water tap so they could drink . I did n't go there right away , though . I hit town around ten o'clock , checked in at a little hotel down by the river , then went to a cafe for dinner . It was just a cheap cafe , like a million of them all over the country that had opened up since Prohibition got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd ever been in a bar . In Baltimore , they had served liquor , of course , but it had come in a cup and had no name and you drank it quick . I ordered a Martini , with steak , fried potatoes and coffee . Then I noticed two girls on stools , talking to each other and not with anybody that I could see . They were just Western barflies , in checked blouses , dungaree pants , and stitched boots , but not so bad either . One of them saw me , looked sharp , then looked again . I looked back . Then I began to wonder if she was having any effect on me . I mean , I was trying to figure if it was getting anywhere , this campaign Buck and I had started by stealing some grub . Next thing I knew the waiter was shaking me to wake tip and eat . Looked like I had some little way to go . I felt my money . It was still there . In the morning I found some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three eggs , flapjacks , and coffee . They treated me O.K. , but by now I was getting more and more selfconsciousabout my scrubbed-out jeans . I began looking for clothes . The good places I stayed out of , because I figured they 'd be shy of the stuff I wanted . But on a side street , back of one of the hotels , I spotted a place that said " summer clearancesale , " and walked over there . First I picked out a pair of heavy khaki work pants , the kind that go up under your chin in front and fasten with a pair of suspenders behind . Then I tried on shoes . I needed brogans , but got the best-looking pair I could see . Then I got two pair of woolen stockings . I think they felt best of all . On the road , if you 've got any socks at all you 're lucky , but if they 're not all full of holes that cut your toes and blister your heels , then you 're asleep , dreaming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was wonderful . Then I picked out drawers , undershirt , and shirt . I wanted a check , like the girls had had , but I happened to think it might be the one thing somebody would remember me by , if they were pinned down in court . I said make it khaki , to go with the pants . Then I picked out flannel pants , to wear under the khaki , a dark coat , and a brown hat , one of the two-and-a-halfgallonjobs that practically everybody wears in that neck of the woods . I dressed in the backroom , and told them to throw my old stuff away . Was I glad to kick it all in a corner , and step out of there clean , whole , and with a decent smell ! Outside , on a bench , at a bus stop , I counted up again , and had nearly sixty dollars . I sat there , trying to think what I was going to do . Across from me girls kept going up and down , and I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , would get me in shape so they looked like girls , instead of just things in skirts . But I had to cut Buck and Hosey in , I knew that , and if I felt it had to be my own way , to be safe , I still had to do it . I walked on down to the store again , and bought them the same outfits . There was no trouble over sizes . I 'd heard them call theirs , so many times , in the missions , I 'd have known them in my sleep . I took the stuff up over to thep187hotel , taking care to keep all sales slips in my hip pocket , in case . I still had a little money left , so I went out and bought beans , bacon , eggs , and stuff . I still had my gunny sack , that I had washed out with the other things in the Salt River , so I opened all packages , dumped them in , and threw away the wrappings . I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . I took it over to the S.P. tracks . From there , following Hosey 's directions , I hit the jungle , and there , believe it or not , feeding a fire he 'd made between two piles of bricks , was Buck . " Well , for . God 's sake look at Adolph Menjou ! " " Buck , how are you ? " " Sir , I 'm fine . " " Hosey here ? " " Out mooching grub . He 'll be along . " " I brought some grub . " " Well , will you talk ? " " Slight case of theft , that 's all . " " You mean  --  ? " " Well , what do you do in a case like that ? I was walking along , going about my business , when up the street a piece of fire apparatus went by . Well , I stopped and looked like everybody else . Then , in front of a store , a party came out , and went running up there , to see better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , I do n't know . Well , could I help it if that was the place I 'd decided to price a few small articles I needed ? I went inside , stomped on the floor , hollered , and whistled three times , and nobody came . So I filled my sack . Every pile I saw , I took three of a kind , and then slid out the back way . But going past the kitchen I noticed some things to eat . Anyway , I dropped them in the sack on the principle we needed them most . Then I beat it . " The way he grabbed those socks , and smelled them , and hugged the shoes to him , made you want to turn your eyes away . Hosey came , with a sackful of the rotten potatoes and bread heels and the crab bait that we always had whenever hep188went out to mooch . He acted the same as Buck , only worse . When we finally got the grub cooked and they were outside some of it and all dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of them and they 'd keep passing their hands over their mouths , to hide their grins , or maybe rub them off . I kept thinking how funny it was , that I had to cook up this yarn , because I could n't trust them with the truth . But then , sure enough , Hosey had the wind-up on it : " Boys , we got to move . " " Why ? " Buck was n't any too agreeable about it , full of food and all dressed up like he was . " Ca n't we just set , for once in our life ? " " They 'll be looking for us . The cops . " " And how would they know who did it ? " " Ai n't we wearing the evidence ? " I wanted to tell him for God 's sake be his age , but I 'd told them this dilly , and if I went back on it I 'd have to tell them the truth , and that did n't suit me . So there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , how we 'd pulled two jobs here in Arizona , and had to get out of the state , quick . So that 's how we came to hit for the bridge and cross into California . WE pulled jobs in Indio , Banning , Redlands , and San Bernardino , then doubled over and pulled one in Mojave . That was a little grocery on one of the streets off the highway , railroad track , and rabbit run in the middle of town . But when I hadp189the stuff sacked , and was tiptoeing out , Buck called . There were shots , and bullets went past my head . I ran so hard that when the three of us met , in a jungle by the water tank , I could n't talk for an hour . We cooked our grub and ate it , but figured the time had come for another change of states and hopped the U.P . for Las Vegas . There , after making two dollars parking cars in a lot on Fifth Street , I took a fifty-cent room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked myself over . In the face , I looked what I was , a hard , sun-baked bum . On clothes , I looked good enough , though not quite good enough to sign in under my own name . Ever since Atlanta , in all missions , flophouses , and joints , I had used some phony monicker , like Dikes or Davis , and that 's what I did now . I went out and tried my luck on the wheels . I bought a dollar 's worth of ten-cent chips at a cut-rate place , and tried a few passes , red against the black . I won . Then I moved over to the numbers , and bet the first twelve against the second and third . I won some more . I raised the ante , and began making support bets , little gambles that did n't add up to much if I lost , but meant a whole lot if I won . I mean , on the first twelve I 'd put fifty cents . Then on the first four I 'd put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents . Then if the ball fell in any number higher than twelve I was out eightyfivecents clean on the whole spin . But if it fell in any number below twelve I cashed a dollar for my fifty-cent bet , and made fifteen cents . If it fell in the first four I made $2.25 more . If it fell on number one I made $3.50 more . Since then I 've seen plenty of gambling , and done a little , and have nothing to say against the system I figured out that night . Any betting 's a gamble , but I 'll say this for support betting : It 's offensive , and if you win you take home something . Hedge betting 's defensive , just a way of stringing it out longer . I did n't have too much luck for a while , just a dribble now and then , but then I landed with number one , and felt the tide come in . I quit after three straight losses , and left with thirty dollars or so.  |p190It  felt good to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were laying kindling , and tell them the truth , and invite them to a room in the motel . Hosey , he hated to cough up , but so long as it was my money he had to . We slept , and then in the morning Buck and I hopped a bus to Boulder Dam , or Hoover Dam they call it now , that was building then , to get a job . They were n't hiring , but said come back next week . So we went back to our motel and cinched our belts , and tried to make our money last by laying on the bed , so as not to get hungry . Then Hosey wanted to move , on account of the guy in the next room to him , who he said had a gun , and kept shifting it around , from the bureau drawer to his trunk to his suitcase , so it got on his nerves . Buck and I did n't quite attach the importance to it that Hosey did , and fact of the matter we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had n't picked up another day on the parking lot , and when things were slack , slipped across to the filling station next door to use the toilet . The manager was fixing a flat , and part of the time he was outside the toilet window with it , beating on the tire with a hammer . Following him around was a kid that seemed to work there , who as well as I could figure out had been transferred to another station of the chain , and wanted tips on how to act . The place he was going seemed to be the " flagship " as the manager called it , the main station , and the kid was a little nervous about what to do . The manager told him how to get there , by following Highway 91 and watching for the sign , and some more stuff that I remembered later . Then I heard the kid say : " When do they open ? " " Seven a.m. , same as here . " " And close nine ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . " " No , you 'll like it . They split it up so the week you 're on early , you 're off before dinner , and when you 're on late , you do n't come in till after lunch . "  | " Funny , though . There 's no business after nine . " " The chief , he do n't bank in Nevada . So every night , after they close , the station managers turn our cash in there , at the flagship . It 's put away , and then in the morning it 's sent over to Barstow , California . Which is why the place closes one hour later . All guys expecting their wife to bring suit for divorce have a strange enthusiasm for keeping their funds in some other state . " At the motel , I lay there in the dark and listened to people snore , and kept telling myself to forget what I 'd heard . I kept telling myself to put it out of my mind I might ever try anythingreal with Buck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of any idea I could do it alone . And all the time I kept thinking of those station managers , driving in late with their little canvas sacks . I kept thinking about Mojave and the bullets , and wondering why , if I had to play shootinggallery , I did n't do it for dough . I guess that was what got me , more than anything else . I began going over it , Hosey 's idea that stealing grub was O.K. , something the judge would go easy on if we ever got caught . Who said he would ? Who said he would n't send us up for ten years , to show the law was meant to be obeyed ? It came to me , we were n't talking about any judge . We were talking about ourselves . What we really meant was : Everybody 's entitled to eat , and if they have to steal to do it , then O.K. , so long as there 's no other way . But anything more than that , regular stealing , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wrong of it . But the way my head kept pounding , I knew I did n't care . In Buck 's room , next to mine , the door opened and footsteps went down the hall . Then the screen door squeaked . Pretty soon I caught the smell of a cigarette . I got up , put on some clothes , and went outside . Buck was squatting on the ground ,  | in pants , coat , undershirt , and shoes , smoking , and staring at the lights of the town . I sat down too . " Kind of restless , boy ? " " Jack , what do we do it for ? Tramp . Steal . Rat . " " I do n't know . " " Why , stead of catching the goddam freight , do n't we let the freight catch us ? You know any good reason we should roll away from those wheels ? " " Tell me something , Buck . This guy with the gun  --  ? " " ... Hosey 's friend ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In his room . Different places . Mostly places he lets Hosey see , so Hosey do n't get any idea he might go in and begin feeling around . Anyhow , that 's how I dope it . " " Could you find it ? " " Could n't you ? What locks are there in this dump ? " " You sure he does n't carry the gun , Buck ? " " I think not . Why ? " I told him what I 'd heard in the filling station . " I figured , for a while at least , we could take care of things by getting ourselves a little dough . " " I 'd call that a little risky . " " O.K. , but I 've noticed something . " " Which is ? " " It 's a wide-open town , same like Kansas City , only more so . On account of Boulder Dam the girls have flocked here . " " Listen , Jack , I 'm listening , but  --  " " Yeah , but how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to talk the gloomiest kind of way about women and how he 's no good any more and never will be , and I calmed him down a little by owning up I was in exactly the same shape . But , I said , what we needed was rest and grub and water on our skins once a day and maybe now and then a couple of jokes . He said to hell with this idea we were just going to steal a little bit , and I said : " Might asp193well be hung for a sheep as a lamb . " That was it , Buck said . After a while we heard something , and when we looked there was Hosey . " Could n't seem to sleep . " " ... Oh . Neither could we . " " Hot . " " Yeah , Hosey , sure is . " " I heard what you guys was saying . I could n't help hearing . All I got to say is : You got the right idea . " " You mean  --  ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped in , while I was shaving . " Well ? Jack , what do we say on letting Hosey in ? " " I guess it 's off . " .. I 'm not so sure . " " Him ? I would n't trust him  --  Listen , Buck , it 's not that I do n't think he likes us , or that he would n't give all the right answers if we asked him how he felt about us , or whatever . It 's just that I do n't think he 's got anything left any more . Hell , I think they could break him with the smell of coffee . You do n't go to war with a bunch of goddam cripples . " " And we , we have got something left , hey ? " " More than he 's got . " " Jack , we can use him . " " For what ? " " Watching , for one thing . He can smell a cop further than  --  " " All right . " " If either one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling something like this . We 're trying to get it back . Maybe he is , too . Maybe  --  " What he really meant was that Hosey had it on us whether we liked it or not , and if we were going to pull this job instead of waiting to pull some other job we had to take him . He was more use than we expected . He went over there to this flagship later that morning , dropped dead in front of the door , and when they brought him to with ice water he came up with stuff about not having eaten for three days , and they let him make a buck cleaning the place off with a squeegee . He came away with a pretty good idea of where everything was , and said as far as he could see there was n't any safe , that the money was kept in a cash drawer out by the pumps , that they opened every time a customer paid . He drew up a plan of the station , with all streets marked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station manager and the boss of the chain . In the late afternoon I figured to get the gun . It 's when most guys want a drink , and while we did n't have much money left , we did scrape together for some liquor and one or two things . I got a pint , with some fizz water , at a drugstore , and they gave me some ice in a container . There was a phone booth in there and I rang a picture theater and got the time of the feature , the newsreels , and all the rest of it , for Hosey . I checked on a bus he 'd have to ride , to join up with us later . When I got back to the motel it was around five . " Buck , you got a beer opener ? . . . Oh , I beg your pardon . I thought this was my friend 's room . I was thinking of throwing a drink together , but I 've got nothing I can use to open my carbonated water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wish I could accommodate you , but  --  " " I 'll find something . " " Would  --  pliers do ? " " I bet they would work . " " You 're welcome to try , if you think  --  " " Well , say , why do n't you try ? " " Is that an invitation ? "  |p195He  was a shriveled little guy , maybe forty , with wrinkles around his eyes , a little red mustache , and a jut-out chin that slewed over sidewise from his . jaw , just about what you 'd expectsomebody to look like that had a .38 in his bureau drawer . How quick he found the pliers was funny , and we went in my room . They did n't work , but by a funny coincidence , the screw driver on my jackknife did . I unscrewed the top of the whisky , that was so cheap it did n't even have a cork , got out the .. glasses , poured drinks , and said : " Here 's how . " Right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't from Virginia . I said no , Tennessee , just outside Chattanooga , and he said he knew it was below the line somewhere . We talked along , I poured more drinks , said : " Here 's how " again . But about that time somebody outside began whistling Casey Jones and I started out . " Excuse me just a second  --  be right back . Help yourself to the liquor . " " Thanks . " Outside , crossing the street , were Buck and Hosey . A block away , I caught up with them . We strolled along and I made Buck show me the gun , to make sure he had it . He spread his coat pocket and I looked in . It was an automatic . We went over it then with Hosey , what he was to do , and explained it to him once more , that it was all part of his alibi , in case he had to prove one . He was to buy a ticket at the theatre , and sit in a loge seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to stay there . If an usher did ask to see his ticket , he was to show it to her and put up an argument , but kind of a rube 's argument , without much steam in it , enough that she 'd remember him , not enough he 'd get thrown out . Then he 'd move and stay in his new seat till the newsreel started , which would be a few minutes after nine o'clock . Then he was to leave , by one of the fire doors marked " Exit , " so nobody could say exactly when he left . Then he was to walk down to Highway 91 and take position about a half block away from the filling station . At anything that even looked like a cop he was to signal us . " O.K. , now . Put your fingers in your mouth and try that screech whistle we 've got to have if you 're going to be any good out there . " " Listen , Jack , I 've whistled that way ever since I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here goes . " " ... Good . " " How much is the theater ticket , boys ? " " Thirty-five cents . Here 's a buck . Better have yourself some java and beans first , and do n't go in much before eight o'clock . Take it easy . Act natural . Talk straight from the shoulder . Let both girls , or anybody you meet going in the theatre , see you . Smile , act friendly , so they really remember you . " Buck and I had some beans at a dump near the station , and when we got done it was eight , and time to get ourselves a car . We walked on toward a residential section , then found a street with some cars parked out on it . At that time cars still had running boards , so in the middle of the block we sat down on one , facing across the street , pretty much out of sight , and watched . We figured that incoming cars , full of people coming home , would be no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to follow them in would be just staking ourselves out . We aimed to catch somebody visiting , that had left their car at the curb and would be going home around eight thirty or a little after . From the time it would take them to leave some house , get to their car , climb in , and find the key , to the time we 'd get there , would be just a convenient interval . I suppose we 'd been there a half hour , getting pretty nervous , when three people , a man , a woman , and a boy , came out of a house up the street . Buck reached for the gun . " No . " " What 's . the matter , Jack , you getting cold feet ? " " We ca n't handle three . "  | " We better be handling somebody . " " Let them go . " They went , and two more parties went , a two and a four . And then came a girl , from a place three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodbye , about not doing anything she would n't do , not taking any rubber nickels , and being good , than you could count . I could hear the cusswords rising in Buck , and chocked him hard , with my elbow , to keep him quiet . But at last she came skipping along , humming under her breath . She got in from the curb side , and we were at the left-hand window , watching her switch on the ignition , before she had any idea we were there . " Easy , easy , easy . " " What ? " " Not so loud . " " Who are  --  ? " Buck slipped his hand over her mouth in kind of a gentle , regretful way , opened the door , and pulled her out . I hopped in , found her bag , started the motor . Then I slid over , in the right-hand seat , so Buck could hop in from the left , where he was holding her . He let go of her and she started to scream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked back . A couple of people were at their front doors , but nobody was running and nobody was shooting . " Look in her bag , Jack . We 've got to have dough , to pay for the gas we order  --  " " ... A five and a one . And change . " " O.K. " " And something else . " " What ? " " A watch . " " Are you kidding ? " We 'd spotted a drugstore with a clock on it , and we 'd expected to check by it , so we 'd come to the filling station exactly when we wanted . But the watch meant we could take a drive , relax , and get our nerve.  | Out of town a few miles , toward the California border , he began to talk : " Jack , how many guys went on the road , do you think , about the same time we did ? " " How many eggs in a shad ? " " Millions , you think ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their sisters ? " " ... How do you mean , Buck ? " " You ever see any girls on the road ? " " Well , I heard stories . " " Yeah , we know about those two bums in a boxcar , come one , come all , everybody welcome . But I 'm talking about those other girls , in homes that were just as hard put to it to feed them as they were to feed their brothers . What happened to them ? " " Well , I 'll bite . What ? " " How would I know ? Except what I think . " " Which is ? " " They stayed home . " " Well ? " " I 've cussed out the goddam country , tonight I stole a car , and I 'm getting ready to do more . But a country that lets a million good-for-nothing tomatoes sit around home till . things get better , just because they 're girls  --  well , somebody thought something of them . " " You could n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody took care of them . " Around nine forty we slipped back to town , and the radios and jukeboxes and orchestras were beginning to hit it up , though not loud like they would later . We checked on Hosey , and there he was , exactly where he was supposed to be , by the sycamore tree , in the shadow of a little real-estate office near  |p199the  sidewalk . We drove past and waved , so he 'd know we were there . We turned the corner , went past the station , checked the manager was at his desk , inside , doing paper work . Nobodyelse was around . We went down the street two blocks , cut our lights , turned around . Then we rolled back toward the station and parked facing it , maybe a hundred feet away . He did n't look up . A car drove up and a guy got out , in the white pants and peaked cap all the managers wore , and a black sweater . The man inside went out and they seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted , and put something inside . The guy in the black sweater drove off . The other one went back to his desk . " O.K. , Buck , get out your matches . " " There 's no matches in this . " " I said get them out . We draw for it . " " Every job we 've pulled , you 've done the dangerous part . This job , I 'm doing it . I 've got the gun , right here in my pocket , so we do n't have to do any shifting , and  --  " " Cut the argument ! " " Then cut it yourself . " He started the motor , snapped on the lights , and pulled out from the curb . In two seconds we were rolling into the station , beside a pump . The manager came out and spoke to Buck : " Yes sir ? What can I do for you ? " " If I 'm not too late for some gas  --  " " We 're open . Fill her up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost empty , so he 'd be some little time . Buck and I got out and went in the men 's room , Buck leading the way . I kind of relaxed on one hip and walked with a limp , so I could fudge three or four inches on my height . Inside , I passed over the money he 'd need when the time came to pay . He went out . A wild idea flashed through my head . From somewhere I could remember those descriptions of wanted persons , saying they were " light " or " dark " or whatever . I lit a match , charred it , and blacked my eyebrows . Then I took a piece of paper , wadded it up , and jammed it in my mouth , between the front teeth and the gum , the way Denny and I had done with cotton , for the pro football pictures . In the mirror I did n't know myself . Instead of being light I was dark , and I had a buck-tooth look that was somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager barely looked at me . Buck had his back to me . I climbed in , took the wheel , and started the motor . Buck said : " O.K. , what do I owe you ? " " Two fifty-five . " Buck passed over the five , the manager went to his cash drawer , and opened it . Inside , from where I sat , I could see thick piles of bills , in their compartments , bulged up high . He picked up two bills and some change , turned and was looking into the .38 . " Step back .... Put your hands on your chest and keep them there . Not high , we do n't want a gallery . That 's it . Now take it easy , do n't get excited , and  --  " When it started I do n't know , but it seemed I 'd been hearingit for years in some kind of a dream , this whistle of Hosey 's . Then , off in the night , a shot sounded . Buck twitched , went three feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into a sack of meal . I went out of there like a bat out of hell . Somewhere I saw Hosey , his face white , running toward me to jump in . I did n't even slow down . Next thing I knew I was out of town , whether two miles or ten I could n't tell you , waiting at a grade crossing while a freight went by . All of a sudden I cut the motor , left the key in the ignition , and jumped out . That freight , brother , was n't meant to be boarded by anything on two feet . I mean , it was going fast . But it was headed west , that was all I wanted to know . I raced beside it , grabbed a handhold , hit the side of the car . I waved my foot around , found a step , pulled myself up . I was on a boxcar . I felt something funny in my mouth . The paper was still there . I hooked it out with my finger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of was.the miles that were clicking by ,  |p20Ibetween  me and what was lying there in a Las Vegas filling station , that had once been my pal , and the other one , that was still my pal , or wanted to be , but that knew something to tell on me . Up ahead , I could see the brakeman coming . I did n't move . When he got to me I waved . " Hiya , big boy . " " Hiya . " FOR three days I sat around the Midnight Mission in Los Angeles , washing dishes for my grub and sleeping in their main dormitory . But it kept worrying me , spending nights with other guys . I was afraid I might talk in my sleep . I picked up a buck or two on some parking lot and moved to a little hotel over on Sixth Street , fifty cents a night and no questions asked . For the first time since I 'd been on the road I signed in under my own name , because I wanted it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept talking to the clerk like he must remember me , and saying how glad I was to be back in Los Angeles from up in Fresno . It turned out he was new there . But then something happened that helped quite a lot . A guy came downstairs , carrying a vacuum cleaner , and telling how well he 'd cleaned the upper halls , and the clerk said fine , he 'd mark him paid right now . So he did . It was just an old-fashioned register , where guys signed their names , or F. D. Roosevelt , or whatever , with their address , if they had one . On the right-hand side was the room number ,  |p202and  beside this was marked " pd . " Soon as I handed over my fifty cents I was marked " pd . " But if this guy was working for his bed , and all they did about it was mark him " pd . " too , that meant there was no cross-check on cash , and that meant , if a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know if the face behind the name had been there or not . I watched my chance , then went to the register and began turningpages . I found July io , the day we held up the station . The page was full up , solid . I looked at July 9 . It was full . But on July 8 there was a blank line . I picked up the pen and wrote " Jack Dillon , City . " Then beside that I wrote a room number , and then with my thumb I smudged it . Then beside it I wrote " pd . pd . pd . pd . " All that time I watched the clerk . He went right on with what he was doing . I went up to my room , lay down , and felt better . It was n't much of an alibi , but it was some kind of alibi . I felt better , but not much better . By day , I tramped around to every garage , shop , and filling station I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then picking up a buck fixing flats . If things had been bad before , they were as bad now as they could get . By night I worked on my clothes with spot remover , then pressed them under the mattress , trying to get myself in some kind of shape in case a chance would come . But it all spelled Skid Row , and sooner or later I knew Hosey would come along , or I 'd bump into him in some soup kitchen , and what that would lead to I did n't know . Maybe he was harmless , but I was afraid of him . So pretty soon , when I got two parking jobs in a row , and had five dollars I could call my own , I made up my mind to blow . Where I did n't know , but I marched myself up to the bus depot at the corner and bought me a ticket for some town down the line . We were slowing down in Whittier , I guess a little before eight in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk . They were in jeans and looked like Mexicans , but I knew they were guys hoping for work . I still had thirty or forty cents ' worth of ticket , but at the next stop I got out and went legging it back to the mob . I guess there were twenty or thirty of them , all talking Spanish , but I found out they 'd come down from L.A. for lemon-picking , on a call from a state bureau . Pretty soon a door opened and we all went inside an office , where a tall guy with a hatchet face began talking in some kind of Spanish . I pushed up front but he kept passing me by , and the Mexicans had all been given cards with numbers , and were back outside , waiting for a truck to pick them up , before he turned to me . " What 's your name ? " " Jack Dillon . " " You American ? " " Native . " " What do you want ? " " Work . " " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? " " Got to eat . " " What else have you tried ? " " Fixing flats , washing cars , parking jalopies , sacking wheat , shoveling guano , blacksmithing drills , panhandling , and stealing . I 've tried everything there is , from East to West and North to South and back again , and if there 's a living in any one of them , I do n't know which one it is . If lemons are what I 've got to pick , then I mean to get at it , but what you 've got to do with what I 've tried , I do n't exactly know . " " You tried the CCC ? " " Yes . " " So ? " " They would n't have me . " " Why not ? "  | " You 've got to be certified . I wo n't go home . " " What other reason ? " ' Commies . " " Then O.K. Let 's talk . To me , an American 's as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how he got here and we 're much too polite to ask , but if he happened accidentallyon purpose to do it by swimming the Rio Grande River , his hindside would be a little wet . " " One would think so . " " Just the same , I do n't recommend this job to you . " " What 's wrong with it ? " " You ca n't stand it . " " How do you know what I can stand ? " " All I know is what I found out from twenty years in the business and watching about eighteen hundred other Americansgo down there and topple over in the heat and quit before lunchtime . A Mexican , he was born to heat , and before you or I or Columbo ever got here he was working in an Aztec chain gang with a tump line over his head and a whip over his back so a nice lemon grove no in the shade practically looks to him like a political job . If you want it , it 's yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't warn you . " " Thanks . Sorry I blew my top . " " That 's O.K. God knows what you 'll blow next . " We rode down in a truck , all of us jammed so close together standing on each other 's feet I hated to think what would happen if we hit something . Two or three miles out of town we turned in between two concrete pillars and began running between miles and miles of orange groves and lemon groves and grapefruit groves , with concrete water pipes all around . Some of the fruit was in bloom , and some of it was ripe and some half ripe , there did n't seem to be any rule about it . Thenp205we came to the ranch houses , the main office and store and mess hall and commissary and bunkhouse and garage and employees ' houses , all painted white with green trim and looking like a dairy would look in the East , or maybe a horse farm in Kentucky . We piled out and went in the office and turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rings are made of heavy wire bent with a ring to measure lemons and a little one for a handle . The lemons are bigger than the ring , then O.K. , cut them even if they 're green . In the packing house they 'll grade for storage and do n't have to be sold right away , as happens with tree-ripened fruit . If they go through the ring , let them hang . The nippers were for cutting . The chalk was to mark your number on your boxes . That stuff they issue to you when- you come in and take up when you go . On lunch boxes , you were supposed to bring your own , and Mr. Holtz , the super , seemed annoyed that I did n't have any , though it seemed to help that I had a canteen . He asked me some questions , and then , after he sent the others off to work in the truck , took me over to the company store , fixed me up with a box , and said I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a little weak before night . I took a can of beans , and he was surprised I could pay and he did n't have to write me an order . Then lie took me to the bunkhouse , assigned me a bunk , and said I 'd do better if I shed all my clothes except the khakis , undershirt , and hat . I changed , and while he was n't looking smelled the blankets . They smelled like hay , and were clean . I made up my mind that short of falling dead I 'd have that bunk . We went to the trees in his car , and on the way passed the jalopies of the fruit tramps , with tents put up beside them , that stunk so bad I was glad when we were by . Now they 're called Okies and Arkies and Louies , as they 've been written up and it has been discovered what wonderful characters they 've got , but then they were just fruit tramps , whole families of men , women , and children that travel around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just whatp2o6 is the system here , Mr. Holtz ? I mean , where do I eat , where do I bathe , how does it work ? I 'm a little new , and I 'd like to know . " So he explained about the mess hall and how I could cook my own stuff , with the pots there in the kitchen , and about the bathhouse and the rest of it . Now , a ranch has a cook and the pickers board with him , but at that time they were on their own , with three or four splitting it up in a cooking team . " And what do I get for all this ? " " The pay is ten cents a box , if you work by the box , or thirty cents an hour , if you want it that way , plus four cents a box . " " Which pays best ? " " By the box , if you can pick . " " Any great trick to it ? " " Well , it 's pretty hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few tricks to it . If I were you , to start , I 'd try the hourly rate . We do n't expect too much , the first day or two , and if you do n't last , at least you have something in your pocket when you leave . " " Do many Americans last ? " " Except- for the fruit , tramps , practically none . " I 've played football games till I thought I 'd drop , I 've hung on to freights till my hands were numb , I 've taken my share on the chin . But for that kind of stuff , that day picking lemons , on the Green Hills Ranch , Whittier , California , topped anything I ever saw or hope to see . You stand on a stepladder that you move from tree to tree , with a pouch slung under one arm , your ring in one hand , your nippers in the other , and pick fruit . Where you first feel it is your back , from the reaching and being off balance all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In boxing , you have to shoot your punches straight instead of swinging them , or the other guy will layp207all over your wrists with his elbows and make you arm-weary . That 's how it is reaching for those lemons . They 're off to one side , they 're over your head , they 're under your knees , they 're any place but straight in front , easy to your hands , so you can size them and cut them and pouch them without any work . At last you get it in the legs , from the strain , heavy aching pains that start back of your thighs and creep down past your knees and into your heels . Long before lunch I was so far gone I thought I 'd pass out , and wondered how the women pickers , the fruit tramps ' wives , could stand it like they did . Then pretty soon a guy passed out , right on top of his ladder . First he was leaning over backwards , reaching for fruit , and then he was leaning too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he throw out his leg , to catch himself ? Then he hit , flat . A girl screamed and scrambled down her ladder . Then she fell . Then a dozen people were around them yelling for a truck . It backed up and took them aboard . Then it was lunchtime and I opened my beans , but by the time I got my back straightened up so I could eat somebody said : Ole . How the afternoon went I ca n't tell you , except now and then I 'd get a box full , and carry it to the end of the row , and start back , and a Mexican would yell something at me in Spanish , and I 'd go back and mark my number on it , in chalk . After a while , off in the trees , I kept hearing a motor , where somebody was trying to start it , and it would cough and die . Then there 'd be an argument in Spanish and another whine from the starter and another cough . At last I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it was the fuel pump , and sure enough , wrapped around it was a wad of rag they 'd used to wipe it off with , just frazzed threads but enough to foul it . 1 pulled them out , had them start it , and it went . I went back to my ladder . At least that was one less thing to go crazy about . At last it came time to quit . I rode back with a couple dozen Mexicans , went in the store , bought some canned stuff andp208Nescafe , and went to the mess-hall kitchen . I heated it up , whatever it was , and ate it . Then I went to the bathhouse and showered . Then I went to the bunkhouse , took off my clothes , and at last stretched out on my bunk . I had it all to myself , as I 'd had the kitchen , because the Mexicans were all outside , laughing and smoking and talking , and had n't even thought about eating yet , let alone sleeping . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside me were twitches , jerks , and hysteria , all trying to break loose , but I fought them back , and was just getting quiet when three Mexicans came in with Holtz and began jabbering in Spanish . Then they came over . Holtz said : " What 's this about that spray ? " " What spray ? " " That you fixed . " " I thought it was a fire boat . " " What ailed it ? " " Fuel pump . Tell them next time they wipe it off use something that wo n't fall apart in a bunch of ravelings like an old flour bag . " " You understand machinery ? " " Little bit . " " You want a job ? A regular job ? " " Yeah . What is it ? " " Tower man on that spray . Tower man is foreman of the gang , three men and yourself . These boys , they kind of went for the way you helped them out . If you want to try it , it 's sixty cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got water , oil , and gas , I 'll make it go . " " Then O.K. And one other thing . " " Which is ? " " You stuck . That impressed me . " I slept for a month . On the food , it turned out I did n't have to cook it , as tower man was a company job , and I couldp209board with Mrs. Emory , wife of the irrigation boss , who had one of the cottages beyond the ravine , two or three hundred yards from the fruit tramps ' camp . She was expecting another addition to the family , so she was glad to make some extra cash , and fixed my lunch box and let me eat the other meals with the family . When I came in from work I 'd shower , dress , and go to supper . Then I 'd go back to the bunkhouse and go to bed . By that time the Mexicans would be hooking it up with phonograph , radio , guitar , or whatever they had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I slept through it like I was doped . Then after a while I did n't sleep so long . I 'd wake up around four or five , with everything dark out there , or maybe the moon still shining , and the birds warbling in the trees , like they do all night in California , and begin to think . I 'd think about my father , and try to remember what he 'd done for me , and forget the other things , so I would n't feel so bitter . I 'd think about my aunts , and how silly they were , and want to laugh and want to cry . I 'd think about my mother , the one time I saw her , and about Miss Eleanor , and how proud she 'd been of me for beating up the organist . It seemed funny anybody 'd ever been proud of me . I thought about Easton , and she seemed a million miles away . I thought about Margaret , and the miserable way I 'd treated her . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart . And down under it all I kept thinking about this thing I 'd lost , that Buck had given his life for , and kept wondering if I 'd ever get it back.  |p210THE  Friday before Labor Day I got paid , quite a lot for a ranch hand , as I 'd made extra by working three or four Sundays getting Holtz 's trucks in shape , and that night I went in to Whittier and got stuff I needed , shirts and things like that . Next day they did n't work , and I lay around and read magazines . Then after lunch I thought if I did n't go somewhereI 'd go nuts and around one o'clock I started out . I hitched a ride to ior , and a couple of hundred yards from our entrance was a bus stop . I walked down there and stood around watching people buy fruit from a little stand off to one side . Pretty soon here came a guy with a box of tomatoes , staggering toward a coupe that was standing there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with kind of a twinkle in his eye , like carrying tomatoes was n't exactly in his line , but he 'd do the best he could with it as long as he had them . He had trouble with the door , and I yanked it open and slipped inside and took his box and shoved it up on the ledge behind the seat so it would n't fall but at the same time he 'd have plenty of room . " Well , thanks , that helps a lot . " " Kind of left-handed , loading stuff in a car . " " Give you a lift , maybe ? " " Well  --  depends on which way you 're going . " It depended on which way I was going too , but that was something I had n't got around to yet . But I heard my mouth tell him : " I 'm headed for the border . " " Oh  --  Tia Juana ? " " I believe they call it that . "  | " In that case , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd do better on the busses than here . I mean , over there , there are more of them . You got to get to San Diego first anyhow , and the through cars all go down the coast , or anyway most of them do . And in Long Beach you 'll have more two ? " " California . We do it big . " He grinned and I laughed and he climbed in and we started . As we rode he talked . He 'd been over to Whittier , he said , to arrange with the photographer to be at his church the next night , to take pictures of the surprise parry they were giving the rector in celebration of his tenth anniversary . He did n't hide it any he was annoyed with the rest of them for not postponing it a week on account of the Labor Day week end . " I have charge of the music , you see , and what they do n't realize is that all summer I 've been running with pick-up singers , kids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular choir members are away to the mountains or some place and nobody due back till next week . The trouble I 've had to round them up I 'd hate to tell you . " " You a musician ? " " Hell , no . Oil 's my business . Been at it thirty years , ever since I was twelve years old . Kind of a roving wildcat , I guess you 'd call me , anyway till I put down a well for a lady that had a property and then married her . After that I settled down , if you can call it settling down to try and manage the little end of some of the worst made deals ever seen in the field . But it 's all I know , so I do it . That and the choir . No , I 'm no musician , but I found out something funny about them a long time ago . They know all there is to know about music , except music . I mean , they can yiddle their fiddle or tootle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody tellsp2I2 them what they yiddle or tootle or bear down on . But to pick out something themselves , and get it in the right key , and learn it , and sing it , why , that would be a little too original for them . So when I went in the choir I began doing some of those things myself , and next thing I knew I was in charge of it all . I just about know two flats from three sharps , but if you sit down and learn it by heart you can teach it to them well enough , and if I do say it myself , when we 've got everybodypresent and our things rehearsed up , we 've got as nice a little choir as you 're going to hear in some time . " I said I 'd been a boy soprano when I was young , so of course that made us buddies , and we talked along pretty sociable . I kind of wished he 'd talk more about oil and less about choir , but at that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , the first I 'd seen of the Pacific Ocean , and he stopped to let me take a gander at it . Then he went on and pretty soon turned into a place that seemed to be his , and said he had to make a couple of phone calls , but then we 'd go . He parked in front of the house , and I could hear him in there talking , but there seemed to be quite a lot of it , so I got out and took a stretch . It was a pretty place , a white frame house with a garage out back , tall trees around it , and lawn clear out to the road , maybe a hundred yards of it . Pretty soon he came out and said a guy was going to call him back , but it would n't be long . I said he should take his time . Pretty soon I could hear him at the piano , going over some kind of church music that sounded familiar , but he played so bad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it : a Dudley Buck Te Deum I 'd sung a hundred times . I hummed it under my breath , and it seemed funny that the whole melody part was too high for me , though once I had stepped into it like it was nothing at all . But when he came to a bass solo it was just right and I rolled it out : " The glorious company of the apostles praise Thee ! " Well , if I 'd set off a pack of firecrackers out there I couldn'tp213have got action sooner . He was at the door in a second , looking all around , and then , at last , at me . " Was that you ? " " Just helping out . " " Holy smoke , what a voice ! " " No , just a barroom buzzo . " " But it 's great ! Say , you said boy soprano , but you never said a word about what your voice changed to . Look , that sounded like the Metropolitan Opera . " I explained a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fourflusher to sing a few notes so they sound like a million dollars and really not be any good at all . Nothing I could say made any impression on him . So far as he was concerned , somebody by the name of John Charles Chaliapin had fallen out of the sky and hit him over the head , and he was n't going to have it any different . " Well , all right . If you think it 's good , who am I to argue about it ? Once I got five hundred dollars a week for it , and if you insist , we 'll agree it 's worth a thousandnow . " " Well  --  " " Yeah ? " " Never mind . " What he meant , I did n't need any mind reader to tell me , was that I should sing in his choir the next night , and why not ? I had nothing to do , and it had been quite some time since anybody had admired me , unless it was Holtz , for the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , and feel your choir could use me over the week end , we might waive the question of pay , and  --  " " Would you ? Would you ? " We shook hands and told names . His was Branch , it turned out , Jim Branch . He took me inside , and next thing I knew he 'd shaken up a drink , a housekeeper was serving sandwiches in the big living room , he was playing me some new Pinza records he had , I was singing along with them , and he was as excited as a kid with a new puppy . Then pretty soon wep214seemed to have a party going on , with six or eight or a dozen of his friends , all sunburned like he was , all looking like they 'd get more fun out of a nice pile driver than a grand-opera record , but all pretty good guys , willing to humor him along . He was about as bad on the piano as he could get and still hit a few notes , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I threw in plenty of winks with it , so nobody got the idea it was to be taken seriously . And then all of a sudden , off in a corner by itself , I see a gimlet eye drilling me through and I almost went through the floor . Because to me that spelled Las Vegas and trouble . I kept on yodeling , but began thinking fast . And the more I thought the less I knew what to do , because if I slipped outside and tried to beat it , he would n't have been human if he did n't pick up the telephone , and then there 'd be a patrol car , pulling up beside me with cops . If I stayed , at least I 'd know what was going on . So I bellowed some Old Man River and they clapped and yelled for more , but pretty soon he lurched over in front of me , took a sip of his drink , and said : " Y ' call y'self Dillon ? " " That 's right . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who y ' think y ' kidd'n ? " " Why , nobody , that I know of . " " Me ? Y ' try'n kid me ? Why , goddam it , I seen y ' play . I seen y ' play football , play right halfback f ' Fall River , seen y ' play against Prov'nce , ' n y ' name 's Healy ! " I guess there was more , something about a touchdown I scored on some pass I intercepted in the last quarter , quite a play , the way he told it . But I did n't exactly hear it . All I got was a mumble , as they all began talking to each other , and then a silence , as they sat looking at me . I got my breath and said : " That 's right , except it was n't Providence . It was Green Bay . "  | " That 's right . Goddam if I  --  " " And I did call myself Healy . Under the rules , the eligibility rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've played pro . But if you need the money , you 've got to change things around . So  --  " " You Jack Dillon ? " " That 's me . " " Of  --  Mar'land ? " " I 'm the guy . " " Holy jumping ... : ' I told you , they were more bedrock than musical , and at the way he kowtowed in front of me , they all went into a different key . They were nothing but oil men , drillers and contractors and engineers , but most of them had been to college , and there 's something about a guy who uses steel that goes for football more than he does opera . All of a sudden it was a different kind of afternoon , with the piano forgotten and the party going on around me , with drinks and jokes and friendly talk . Most of them were from the West and had never heard of me , but that made no difference . And changing my name made no difference either . That a guy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packers and not get killed was wonderful to them . To me , it all felt great . I wished it could go on that way forever . Somewhere along the line I took a trip to the powder room , and from there to the bar to sweeten my drink . At a table , reading a magazine , was a woman , and I remembered I 'd seen a car drive up and heard some kind of whisper going on . I started to go , but she motioned to me , and then looked up . " Oh ! I thought you were one of the oil gang , or petrol patrol , as I call them . " " No , just a visiting fireman . " " I 've been told . Mr. Dillon , is that it ? " " To his friends , Jack . " " And quite a celebrity , I believe ? "  | " You 're supposed to bow . " She got up and bowed . " I 'm Mrs. Branch . " " I 'm very pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Now I 'm not only pleased , but honored . " " I do n't believe you are at all . " " Anyway , excited . " " Now that 's more like it . " She fixed my glass and made a light one for herself , and we stood there looking at each other . She was maybe twenty-five , a little less than medium height , kind of thick in the chest and what went with it , slim in the waist and what was below . All that you could see fine , in the blue slacks and a peppermintcandysweater with stripes running around . But what you noticed most was the eyes , and I still do n't know if they really looked like they did , or were a production job , from what she did to bring them out . Her hair was light , with a brassy green in it , and fell on her shoulders in curls . But her skin was copper , like some vase in a Chinaman 's window . I 've seen plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it made the eyes look like something that came out of the sea . They were big , and light gray to start with , but with that dark color around them , they had a dangerous , slaty , sharky expression , and I think she knew it , and did everything to heighten it . But when we got to talking , it was about me , and what I did . She acted surprised when I said I squirted spray on a fruit ranch . " A celebrity , engaged in labor ? I thought at the very least , you tasted tea , with sighing maidens bringing it to you , with a rose petal in every cup . " " Well , the dope 's brought by Mexicans . " " The  --  what did you say ? " " Dope . Soup . To kill the bugs . They bring it in trucks , roll off the drums , and stack it up at one end of the row so we can put it in the tank and squirt it on the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  let 's talk about you . " " Me ? " " That sunburn . Are you that way all over ? " " ... I wonder . " She stared at me so I could n't look away . I went over to where she was perched on a stool by the bar , and I knew , and she knew , what I meant to do . I was going to give that sweater a wipe , from her waist to her neck , that would tell how she was all over . But from somewhere inside me came a warning , a gone , sick feeling that reminded me of what the liquor had made me forget : If that wipe did tell something , and we began to whisper date , I 'd be no more use to her than a cigar-store Indian . So when I got to her I stopped , mumbled how goodlookingshe was , gave her a light kiss on the lips , and took a sip of my drink . Her eyes flickered , and she looked at the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " On you ? How ? " " Like Flit . Or Larvex ? Or Clorox ? " " No . Why ? " " Just wondered . " She drank out , put down her glass , and went in where the party was , while I sat there . But then she was back . " Why did you do that ? " " What ? " " You know what I mean . " " You got a husband ? " " Are n't you his guest ? " " Then ask him why . " " You mean it 's honor ? Man to man ? That stuff ? " " It could be . " " I 'll be damned if I believe it . " " There 's some of it around still , whether you believe it or not . A guy gives me a lift , invites me in , treats me fine  --  that would be swell , would n't it , if I turned around then and made a pass at his wife . "  | " There 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You did make a pass at her . " " Says who ? " " You think a woman does n't know ? It could be a mile away , but if it goes click , it 's a flash that goes from one to the other , and it 's like nothing else on this earth . And it could be an inch away and mean nothing , like that rotten little kiss you dusted me off with . " " Maybe that 's when I remembered . " " You mean , honor ? " " About time , I 'd say . " She thought that over , then said : " No . A woman does that . Remembers her honor , or whatever she winds her clock by . But when she does , it is n't easy . It 's a struggle , and costs her plenty , and she sighs and sobs and moans . But you , you did n't struggle . It went click , and then  --  nothing . It was just as though the juice had suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconnect switch , probably . " " Oh , God , is there such a thing ? Can I buy one ? " The party went on the rest of the day and most of the night , there and in town and all around . Pretty soon I got so I knew one from the other , and they began to have faces and names I could tell apart . It turned out nobody had come for social purposes especially , but had dropped by on business , just **25;3264;TOOLONG powwows . The guy that had spotted me was named Dasso . He was tall , thin , and red-haired , maybe around thirty , with glasses so thick they had circles in them , and gave his eyes that gimlet look . He worked for Branch , as super at the wells . He had brought over a driller named Butler and some geological dope that they were taking to Bakersfield Monday . Then there was Mr. White , that seemed to be con/netted with the bank , and a couple of engineers he had brought with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blueprints . Mr. White I went for pretty heavy . He was tall , square-shouldered , and around fifty , but quiet , with a little grin when something made him laugh , and dressed in white duck , that advertised him for an old-timer , as not many wear it any more . It was at his house we had supper , and of course cocktails , and in his pool I won the bet with Dasso , five dollars I could touch all the ladders under water , one time around , without coming up . Around midnight I was back at the Branches , with a room all to myself , and fresh pajamas , shirt , and underwear waiting for me . Next morning , in church , we did the Te Deum and two anthems , and I sang The Lord 's Prayer . That afternoon we fished off Mr. White 's boat , but were back in time for more anthems and Handel 's Largo . The singing I made pretty solemn , and maybe it was n't so hot , by Victor-Red-Seal standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Beach , California , it went over fine . During all that time she 'd been out there , on the edges somewhere , drinking long drinks at the pool , sitting in a back pew of the church , stretched out on a hatch cover while we fished , rubbing herself with oil so the sunlight would get in its effect , quite something to see . I was n't talking to her , though , until Sunday midnight , after we 'd all come back from the church , and she went out to the kitchen to fix lunch for Branch , Butler , and Dasso , on their trip next day , as the housekeeper'dbeen given the holiday off . I went out and helped , anyway to cut bread crusts off and spread butter while she sliced up ham and tongue and egg . She was in the same dark dress she 'd worn to church , but when she put on a cellophane apron she looked more like herself . I mean , it was invented to display goods , and does . I strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is there something I can get for you ? " " I 'm not hungry , thanks . " " Drink ? " " If I put down any more booze , I 'll fold . " " If there 's anything you 'd like , please ask for it . You did sing like an angel , as perhaps I should have mentioned sooner , and are certainly entitled to something in the way of special in-dulgence . " " Nothing I think of now . " " Ca n't you look at me ? " " I 'm cutting bread . " " ... Jack , I ca n't figure you out . " " Any law you 've got to ? " " Maybe not , but you ca n't blame , me for thinking . Yesterday I washed you out , for reasons we need n't go into . But today , and especially tonight , you sang , and the reasons I had did n't make sense . I mean , what came out of your throat was somethinga woman could go for . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ? " " If I told you , you 'd know , would n't you ? " " And I certainly want to . " " It 's the same one : Your husband 's a nice guy . " " And how would you know ? " " He 's been pretty nice to me . " " But not to everybody , you might find . " " Pretty near everybody , from what went on yesterday and today . He 's got an awful lot of friends , guys that seem to think the world of him . Guys in the oil business , with hard rock in their bones and something like it , anyway good solid stuff in their souls . And their wives . At the church , I noticed they like him . I did n't notice them falling all over themselves over you . You were left off by yourself , I 'd say  --  far left , and rear . " " I do n't go for old fogeys . " " Maybe they do n't go for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the tears going on that , and began a long song and dance about the lonely life she 'd led , since she buried her father " beside my uncle and my mother , in the little cemetery on the hill . " Then she said : " I had to have somebody to run the wells , and these awful filling stations I 'm afflicted with , and he came along , and it seemed like the thing . " But , she said , it " had n't worked out , " and she was beginning to wonder if it all was n't a " terrible mistake . " All it cut up to , to me , was a twenty-minute egg that had grabbed a good manager by marrying him , and then began shopping for a little excitement on the side . She let the cat out of the bag one time , I thought , while she was going to town on the way she was treated , when she said : " And what do I care what they think ? What do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's mutual . " " O.K. , but why pick on me ? " " You really want to know ? " " Just for curiosity , I 'd like to . " " Your curls , for one thing . " " Baby , I just need a haircut , that 's all . " " You get them cut , and I 'll murder you . Right there , the way they peep out , over your ear , I could eat them . Them and your dimples . " " My  --  ? What the hell are you talking about ? " " You do n't know about them ? " " I have n't got any . " " They 're right under your shoulder blades , on each side . I did n't notice them till you made that crazy bet with Dasso , and I could see them , where you were swimming around down there . I thought at first it was water , the way it dapples in the sunlight , but today , when you were heaving that line , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Take your hands away . " " Why should I ? "  | " The circumstances . " " What do you mean , circumstances ? " " Hot pants , cold heart . " I tried to sleep , but could n't , on account of what was runningthrough my head  --  not about her , but the church , and the singing I 'd done , and the crazy twenty-four hours I 'd had , with jokes , and a little liquor , but mostly guys slapping me on the back , telling me I was swell . I guess that sounds silly , that a little of that kind of thing could take me so high , but not to somebody that spent two years on the road , and divided the world with the rats . It meant so much to me I kept going back over every little thing that had happened , and thinking what I might have said , swell gags that would have made everybody laugh . Around about daybreak I must have dropped off , becausewhat woke me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched low , and the smell of coffee . Then , just after sunlight began to shine in the room , there were footsteps outside , the roll of a garage door , and the sound of a car . It was out on the road before the door slammed shut . I lay there , inhalingthe cool air from outside , and feeling good , I could smell the morning in it , like I could when I was a kid . And then all of a sudden my heart began to pump , because I knew why that was : what a summer of food , drink , and sleep could n't quite do , a little sociability had . It was back , what I 'd worked for , hoped for , prayed for . I was n't a thing any more , I was a man . Then hammers began going in my head . There had n't been any woman 's voice down there , and that meant she was still in bed , on the other side of the partition from me , not ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there . I jumped up , dived in the bathroom , and shaved . I stepped in the shower , turned on the warm water , and let it splash over me . The back of thep223shower was black marble , and I could see reflections in it . Then it seemed to me they moved . I turned and caught my breath . She had on red shoes , red cap , and red enamel on her fingernails , but the rest was pure copper . If that was all , I think I might still have thrown her out . But she closed her eyes , and her lashes lay out on her cheek , like an angel in some old painting . I folded her in my arms . THE Mexicans were still playing cards that night when I went in the bunkhouse , and they did n't even look up when I walked by . I sat watching them , and pretty soon a boy came in , son of a driver , and said Holtz wanted to see me . I went over to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . I said spraying as usual , and he said let it go . That time of year it was n't so important , and he 'd put the Mexicans to leveling road for a while . I , he said , was to stand by a ditchdiggingmachine that was coming in , to put in a trench for pipe that was to be run over to a field where new trees would be put in whenever the nursery could deliver . " We 've been digging our own ditches , but on a long one like this , I 've decided to find out if it would n't be cheaper to hire this fellow and his machine . I 've got him by the day , though , and that 's where the catch comes in . If he 's broke down half the time , he 'll cost us more , time the job is done , than all the Mexicans I can hire . I want you there . The main trouble with those machines is they 're just one jam of toggle plates , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a tank cart with a hand pump , and the first sign of trouble , clean him off . Keep him washed , and maybe we 'll get the doddam thing dug some time between now and Christmas . " " Christmas ? Three days ought to do it . " " Then fine , take it away . " I went back to the bunk , found the Saturday Evening Post under my pillow , opened it up to the story I 'd started two days before , began reading where I 'd left off . It seemed funny , here I 'd had the most terrific week end of my life , anyway in the things it had done to me , after what I 'd been through , and nobody even knew I 'd been away . Everything was so much like it had been that I think I 'd have wondered if I 'd been away too , if it was n't for this thing drilling in the back of my head , this sense of shame over the fine way Branch had treated me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the next three days , out there with Stelliger , the guy with the ditching machine , listening to him brag about how well he 's done with this thing and his bulldozer and his tractor and his shovel and his truck , I kept wishing I could have back the day that had changed everything , and yet knowing I could n't have resisted it , once the chance came to me . And I kept dreading Thursday night , when I knew Mr. Branch would be over , propositioning me about rehearsal that night , so we could work up something for Sunday that would be really good . And sure enough , right after supper there he was , over by the store , waving at me with a little grin on his face , and coming over . He apologized at the way he 'd run out on me Monday , but said he knew of course his wife would get me home all right . Then he went back over it the swell time we 'd had . He said Mr. White had been especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was arranged for me , maybe with the same little independent refinery that backed up right behind Mrs. Branch 's property . I said swell , and wished he would go . Little by little he got around to it , and I could hear thyselfp225saying it in a shifty , two-bit way that I hated : that we were awfully busy that week , and I did n't see how I could possibly help him out with the choir  --  but some other time , sure , some other time . He swallowed two or three times , and looked away quick . He was like most other hard-rock men , shy on the inside as a young girl , and I stood there with my hat off to him for it , and yet not able to say so . He was hardly out of sight than there came the pop of a horn from the trees near the shop , and lights blinking on and off at me . I went over and she was at the wheel of her car . " I was looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to get out of sight , quick . What did he want ? " " Choir . " " And he came clear over here ? " " What do you want ? " " What do you think ? " " I 've no place to take you . " " I have , Jack , as it happens . Nothing but a cottage by the sea , or in plain English a beach shack . But a place  --  I can take you . I tried to tell her to go , that I was ashamed of what we had done , that I was through with her . No words came . Next thing I knew I was in the car with her and we were rolling through the trees . She kept on down for to a road that turned right , then ran over to the Long Beach traffic circle . From there she ran on down below Seal Beach . When she came to a concrete apron drifted over with sand , she turned in . We got out and she opened a garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got out and closed the garage door . We climbed over the dune , that bulges up at that point in a way to make it look like the sea is higher than the road . On the other side of it were shacks . We turned into a little cement walk , she got a key out of her handbag , and opened a shack door . When we stepped inside it was stuffy , like it had n't been opened for some time . But after the wind from the sea it felt warm , and we were in each other 's arms , her mouth pressed hot against mine , almost before we shut the door . We stayed an hour . Then we had to leave , so she could take me to the ranch , drive home herself , and still be able to say she had been to a picture show . " .. . Which one ? Do you happen to know ? " " I saw it this afternoon . " " On purpose ? So you could be with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all fall and through the winter . It was one of those southern California Januaries where it 's spring right after New Year 's , and when she began picking me up Sundays as well as Thursday nights , she 'd put on a red bathing suit and go splashing out in the surf . That made me nervous , because it Nvas one more thing to make people take notice of us , but at least , peeping at her through the window while she was out there , it did give me a chance to get some kind of an idea what she looked like . That may sound funny , but getting a glimpse now and a flash then , mostly at night when we were both so nervous we could hardly draw our breath , I still thought of her mostly as a whisper in the dark . Well , she looked like some college girl in her little red trunks , red shoes , red hat , and red halter , and now that the sunburn was wearing off , she did n't have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now they did n't show up so funny , were more human too , and sometimes , specially when she 'd keep looking at me while I was doing something around the place , soft , and warm , and pretty . And yet , right in the middle of them , was a light that never quite left them , and that was hard , and meant to take whatever it wanted , no matter who got hurt . She made it plain , morning , noon , and night , that she was taking me . I made it plain she was n't and we had a couple of fights about what a tramp she was . Once , when she came to the ranch , Ip227refused to get in the car with her , and she stayed out there , by the shop , with her lights on and her elbow on the horn , till Holtz called an officer , and it was n't till he got there that she drove off . The other time I beat it out of the beach shack before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the ranch . Both those times I missed her bad , every way there was but the right way . When she showed up after those fights , each time on a Thursday night , I was so glad I was ashamed of myself . " Listen , you big lug , I lie awake thinkingabout you . I  --  yen for you . You 're in my hair . " " O.K. , then . I can say the same . " " You mean you love me , Jack ? " " I did n't say so . Do n't get so excited . Yen . " " How 'd you like to go to hell ? " " On my way . " " Jack  --  no ! " " Then watch how you talk . " " All right , yen . But a lot ? Yen , yen , yen ? " " Yeah , and yen . " All that time , as I say , she kept looking at me , and I guess I liked it , anyway at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd ask her what it was about , and she 'd laugh . But then one afternoon , when we were making a Sunday of it at the beach , she said : " Jack , would n't that be funny if I 'd been making the same mistake I made once in a poker game ? " " So you 're a gambler too ? " " I 've done a good many things . " " And what was this mistake ? " " I drew to a straight and filled a flush . " " That 's impossible . " " You sure ? " " Unless , holy smoke , it was a straight flush . " " I found that out , when I was getting ready to throw up my hand . A flush would n't have been one-two-three with what was against me . But then I looked again , and saw I had filled a flush and a straight . " " Did you clean up ? " " Twenty-seven bucks . " " And what 's that got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fell for your beauty . " " My dimples . I remember . " " But these last few weeks I 've been noticing a look in your eye . And I 've been listening to you talk . Especially about those big dynamos and things you studied in college . And I 've been wondering if perhaps I should n't have fallen for your brains . I decided , quite some time ago , that a smart dame would keep romance and business separate . I married business , and I guess it works  --  pretty well . I play around with romance , and I know that works  --  damned well . Do you hear me , Jack ? " " O.K. , but what 's the rest of it ? " " I said it works damned well . What do you say ? " " So does a stink bomb . " " That 's not nice . " " Neither is it . Even if it does work . " It was an hour , I guess , before she decided to go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd stop insulting me every minute , I had a hunch . Some weeks ago . Like the one I woke up to in the poker game . That maybe you 're a straight and also a flush  --  beauty and brains all in the same package . I mean , if you tried , you could make the business go damned well , too . " " Meaning , on husbands , you want to switch ? " " Well ? " " No . " " Jack , I 'm sorry , but for me pretty well is n't well enough . It has to be damned well or I 'm not interested . For three years now that jerk has been trying to sell me something just as good . Telling me I should n't get excited . That I should take it easy . That I should wait . That things are bound to get better.  |p229And  I 've listened to him . Owning property that should make me rich , that could mean something if it was handled right , I 've stood by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a mess . My wells are pumping less all the time , and in a few years they 're going dry . And yet I have to keep this miserable shack , when with smart work I could have a real place at Pebble Beach , all because a damned jerk  --  " " That jerk is a swell guy . " " A jerk is a jerk . " " If he says wait , I 'd bet waiting does it . " " I want what I want when I want it ! " " Who sang that was a basso named  --  " " Shut up .... You going to spray fruit all your life ? " " I did n't start my life spraying fruit , and I do n't expect to end it that way . But just at the moment , until I see where I 'm coming out , I 'm doing it . I booted the beans into the fire just once too often , I 'm sorry to say , and the way I paid for it I hope you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . But at that , compared with the onion-hoeing I see most of them doing , and the lousy grand operas some of them are singing , and all the other stuff that 's being done by guys too proud to spray fruit and too dumb to do anything else , my job suits me fine . " " Jack , I 'm talking about big things . " " You 're not talking about anything that I can hear . " Now I was myself again , quite a few things had come back , and one of them was the twist in me that made me blow my top when somebody was trying to make me do something I did n't want to do . And I was finding out things about cold heart . As long as it 's a toy , it can be as childish as anybody , and roar , or kick slippers through the window , or whatever . But when it really sees something it wants , it can wheedle , wait , and watch you for the right time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me run down , and when it got dark lit the grate , so we sat there in the blue light from the gas . Then she made coffee and opened some chili con carne . When I said it was time we got started back to the ranch , she got up meek as pie , handed me my tie , and helped me on with my coat . I 'd got some new clothes , and she said they looked swell . But when we got to the Long Beach traffic circle , instead of cutting inland she kept on through Long Beach , and pretty soon turned to the right , into a small narrow street . And then all of a sudden we were in oil , with the reek of it everywhere and derricks all around us , thick as trees . " You like that smell , Jack ? " " Would anybody ? " " You would . For one thing it speaks to your damned machinist'ssoul . And for another thing you 've got brains enough to know it comes from the guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is important . " " It 's pretty terrific . " " Could n't you say so ? " " I could , if it was n't a build-up . " " For what ? " " The big switcheroo . " " You 're damned right it is . " " You 're wasting your time . " " I generally get what I go after . " There are no street lights in an oil field , and we rolled along pretty slow , through gray tanks , gray pipes , gray pumps , and gray steam . But then , ahead of us , was a string of lights going straight up , in the air , and when we got nearer I could see they were hanging from a derrick . " Now I 'm excited , Jack . That 's a new well going down . " " They work on Sunday ? " " Sunday , Monday , every day , three shifts twenty-four hours around the clock . They have to keep going . If they did n't , if they broke it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle in the mud , they 'd have to clean out their hole , and they 'd lose hours and hours . "  | " Mud ? What 's that for ? " " It 's pumped through the drill . " " Oh , to cool it . " " And carry away the cuttings from the formation . It 's pumped out then . " " Did n't they ever try water ? " " I do n't know . " " Well , if I could think of it they could think of it . Maybe water 's too thin to carry all that sand and grit and shale away with it . " " Yes , I think that was the trouble . " When we got near she cut over , straight across lots , and then we could see the drill crew , five or six of them , in slickers and hard composition hats , all around the rotary table , that was turning in the middle of the derrick floor , a few feet above ground level . They waved her back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted one she knew , and spoke to him . He recognized her and said something to the driller , who craned around at us from the levers he had hold of , that were connected with a big drum that had cable spooled on it , and regulated the feed to the bit . Ile nodded and waved us over and we got out and climbed ul ) there . " We 're putting on a new drill in a couple of minutes , if you want to see it done . I 'd stand over by that rathole if I was you . We 're setting pipe on the other side . " The rathole was an open pipe , sunk down in the ground , that they drop the Kelly in , as they call it , when they 're changingbits . We stood over there , and sure enough , they began coming up with the pipe . A guy went up to what they call the fourble board , that platform you see , about two thirds the way up on all oil derricks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The traveling blocks would go up with a stand of pipe , and grab it with a tongs . Then with what they call a cathead they 'd break the joint , spin it out with the rotary table , and when it was free , lift it out with a spring hook . Then the derrick man , the one on the fourble board , would guide it behind the- fingerboard , as they call it , a rack that holds the pipe , one stand beside the other , as they take it out . Then another section of four would come up , and another and another . So fast I could hardly believe it , they had that pipe out , four thousand feet of it , by my figuring , a new bit on , and the pipe going down in the hole again . The bit was one I 'd never seen , though I 'd read about it . It had three pinions , with teeth in them , that rolled around and cut the rock , and in the middle of them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out drill cuttings between drill pipe and casing . It made the bit I had smithed up , for the road quarry that time , look like something used by Indians ten thousand years B.C. She explained it all to me , as well as she could , and as soon as the rotary table was going again , so they were makinghole , the driller came over and explained it , and in between , the roughnecks explained it . Everybody explained it , and I could n't help eating it up . I could have stayed there all night . When we left the well , she took a different road , that led up a hill , and pretty soon she stopped . We got out , and she led me up a rise , past a cemetery , to a plot that had half a dozen wells on it , with one or two pumps going , but with the derricks removed . She explained that a wooden derrick is generally left standing , as there 's not much it can be used for anywhere else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . All the well needs , from then on , she said , is a Christmas tree , so there 's no use wasting valuable steel . The Christmas tree is an attachment for the control of natural flowing oil wells . She showed me one , and from the number of gauges and valves on it , all of them round and most of them different colors , you could see how it got its name . When pressure eases off , so they have to install pumps , the Christmas tree is taken away . I got the flashlight from her car , and climbed down into concrete pits and over pipes and throughp233shed doors , and she answered my questions , pretty well , I 've got to say for her . Then , after a while : " You know what place this is , Jack ? " " Yours , I suppose . " " That 's right . " " Where 'd you get it , if I may ask ? " " From my father . " " I remember now , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he gave me a lift . But he said something about your uncle , too . " " My father and uncle came here from Ohio , all hot to go in the oil business , and my uncle persuaded my father that the future of oil was in the selling end of it , not the production . They 'd had romantic dreams , you see , as the papers were full of the boom out here , and they had some money they got from selling the hardware store they had run , back in Toledo . But then my uncle got to reading about the gold boom , back in the fifties , and how Mark Hopkins had made so much money , not from sluicing gold , but from selling shovels and boots and bacon to those who were sluicing it . He sold my father on the idea of garages , to sell the oil , or filling stations , as they 're called now , instead of wells , to produce it . So my father had to give up all his fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheds , as he called them , and presently he sent for my mother and me . And we had hardly got to Los Angeles when my mother caught cold in the miserable damp hotel my uncle had found , and it went into pneumonia , and she died . And my father arranged to bury her , as he thought in Tropico , as Glendalewas called then , on the hill that 's now Forest Lawn Cemetery . But where the procession came was this hill , Signal Hill , as it 's now called . It was pretty forlorn , and my father hated to leave her here in the little cemetery we passed on the way up . He took it pretty hard , and after a while he decided that forlorn or not , he wanted to be near her , so he bought a lot , and almost every night we 'd come to it , and stand looking over her grave and the ocean , and imagine what it would be like when we got the house built and began living in it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was against it , but by that time nobody paid much attention to what he was against , as the filling stations were n't located right for the way the town was growing , or anyhow most of them were n't , and nothing that he touched had gone right . And then on Signal Hill they struck oil . So instead of building a home on it we drilled , right here on the land you 're standing on . And my uncle could n't get over it that in this way , almost as though God had taken a hand in it , my father had got what he wanted . My uncle messed things up , though , before he died , as usual . My father was for selling the stations and putting the money in this little refinery back of us , that had just been built then , and had cost too much , and could be had , cheap . He said when we knew what we were going to do with our oil , then would be time to go ahead on wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size to it , or anything except the peanut way he always wanted to do business . He insisted we get some wells down first , so we had money coming in , and then see about branching out . So that 's what he did , and had to borrow even more money from the bank than we would have had to do to take over the refinery . And the more oil we pumped , the cheaper we had to sell it to the pipelinecompanies , and to get gas for the stations , the dearer we had to buy it back . It was just a squeeze . At that time nobody knew what an integrated company was , but that 's what they call it now , and that 's what my father , just on instinct , wanted  --  a company that produces its own crude , manufactures its own gas , lube oil , fuel , and asphalt , and sells in its own outlets . But we bumbled along , and always it seemed if we could just get one more well we could break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months after him , my father , and they 're buried there , beside my mother . Then the bank ran things awhile , and after I came of age I ran it , with a little assistancep235from the bank , or anyhow the bankers . That 's where I got my ideas about men , in case it interests you , and maybe I 'm wrong , but nothing 's come up to prove I am , yet . We had some wild parties , but the squeeze went on , exactly the same . And then , on the last well that was drilled , with money from the bank , I began seeing quite a little of the contractor . And it seemed , from the way he talked , that he might know what should be done . So in a soft moment , I married him . And just for a little while , we were headed somewhere , or that 's what he said . One more well , and we 'd have that margin , that safe extra income , that would make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what we 're doing now , getting ready for another new well  --  letting contracts for the derrick , for the cement , for everything except the drilling , because of course we do that ourselves because we used to be in the business and can do it cheaper , and in addition to that can give a lot of old pals jobs . So there 's the bank , just where it always was except it 's holding new paper for the old notes we paid off , and there are the wells , getting a little older each year , and here I am , not getting any younger that I notice . " " Does anybody ? " " It 's a mess just the same . And if all that was n't bad enough here , now there 's the allocation . " " The  --  ? Did you mention it ? " " I do n't say it would n't have worked , the safe and sane policy , though it reminds me a lot of my uncle . But then came the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping oil like mad , and selling it for what they could get . So of course that would damage the field , by lowering gas pressure . So after the election , in connection with the blue eagle there was all kinds of talk , and they were allowed to do some regulating . It 's all supposed to be voluntary , but they tell you what you can pump just the same .... Twelve hundredbarrels a day ! For my six wells ! When they 're capable of yielding three times that ! Is that fair , now I ask you ? What good is a new one going to do me if that 's how it 's got to run ? And  --  he makes me perfectly furious with the attitude he 's got toward it . " " What attitude ? " " ... Maybe that 's where you come in . " " If I come in . What are you hinting at ? " " Suppose there was all kinds of undercover stuff going on . Suppose not everybody believed in this blue eagle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue buzzard ? Would you pay too much attention to this allocation stuff ? Just how much do you believe in ethics ? " " You mean , would I sell it bootleg ? " " Yeah , that 's what I mean . " " No . " " I never noticed you so terribly honest . " " Oil and wives are different . " We started climbing down , and at the cemetery she turned in , walked over , and after a little way , stopped . I saw her drop something on a grave . It was chalk white , and I was pretty sure it was one of the geraniums that grew in a bed in front of the shack , something quite a few people have , as it 's one of the few flowers that 'll grow near the sea . It crossed me up , as usual , that mixed in with the hundred-per-cent bad was something good . She came back and I gave her arm a little pat . She took my hand in hers and we went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack ? Because if you 'd take it over now , before we get started on that new well  --  " " I wo n't take it over . " For two or three weeks she kept it up , with a lot of talk about how she was just as fed up with two-timing as I was , and wanted to ring down on it , and get started in some kind of decent way , but could n't , with that well about to start ,  |p237because  if that got under way before she had the showdown she 'd have to let him go through with it anyway . After a while she quit talking about it , but one Monday night she was over , and it turned out the well had started , and as it took all of his time she could get out any night now . We went down to the shack , then on the way headed for Long Beach . I was nervous , and kept begging her to watch where she was going , for fear we 'd run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , not far from the refinery , and peeping around the bubble tower we could see Branch with two or three guys , poking around with a flashlight . " The rig-builder has just set the concretefor the four derrick corners , and Jim has to see how the work is done . " After that , every night we 'd have a look , and almost sooner than you could believe it they were putting up steel , and then it was in place , and the crown block was up . She tried again , to get me to take over , and said she had money , a lot of money , that was mine if I 'd only say yes . I kept telling her I knew nothing about oil , but that just made her beg harder . One night , when we parked , we could hear the rotary table , and see the white helmets under the lights . They were drilling . Two or three nights after that we went to the shack , and she cried , then lay in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the kitchen and lit the gas and put on the kettle . In a minute I went out to keep her company , and we stood around a few minutes in the dark . Then , just as she was reaching for the coffee , a car door slammed on the other side of the dune . She looked out and then cut the gas . " Oh , my God , Jack . It 's my husband  --  and Dasso ! " " Well  --  you asked for it . " " Why in the world did n't I think of it ? It 's about two miles closer to the well than the house is , and Jack , what are we going to do ? " " I do n't much care . " That was n't , strictly speaking , true . I hated the whole damned business , but not like I hated the idea of facing Branch . Maybe I 'd got to a certain point , but if there was still any way to duck a showdown , I 'd take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room and shoved me in a closet that had been built in one corner to hold rods and tackle , I went as fast as she did , and held my breath maybe a little tighter . It seemed funny to be jammed in there with her , half of me scared to death , the other half full of the same creepy feeling she always gave me , of wanting her . Outside , they were knocking the sand off their shoes on the walk , then the key clicked in the lock and they were inside and a light was shining through the crack . Branch said sit down , he 'd rustle something up in a minute , and went in the bedroom , where the liquor cabinet was . In the living room , there was scraping and bumping and moving around , and I do n't think Dasso was doing a thing but looking at the pictures of Branch catching fish , but he sounded like a whole troupe of acrobats practicing the double front . Then Branch was back , and they seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two neither of them said anything . Then they began talking about the well and Branch said he was quite satisfied with the way it was going , and said Dasso ought to take quite some credit to himself . Dasso said it was going all right and they had another drink . Then all of a sudden Dasso said : " Well , goddam it , who said it was going all right ? It 's going the best of any well I 've seen put down , and maybe it 's somethingyours truly had a little to do with , but mainly it 's the big boss , a guy named Branch . A well 's like everything else , it goes in exact proportion to how you plan it . And this one 's been planned right , believe me . Everything 's been taken care of , from the right crew to the right geological report to the right contracts to the right equipment . If we 're drinking to me , we better hoist one to you while we 're about it , and make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drink out . "  | " Drink out yourself . " " I 've still got a little . " They got around to number three in due course , but not until she almost choked on the dust in there , and had to squeeze on my hand till I thought the nails must be drawing blood to keep from coughing . Pretty soon I heard her breathe : " Thank God , " and you could tell from the scraping and bumping that had started again that the drinking was over and Branch and Dasso were ready to go . And then I heard Dasso say : " Jim . " " Yeah , what is it ? " " What 's the window doing open ? " " Well  --  you put it up .... Did n't you ? " " Did I ? " " Or  --  maybe I did . " " Did either of us ? " There was a long time when nothing was said , and then : " Jim , were you ever shadowed ? " " Not that I know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title case , over at Santa Fe Springs . It had hardly started before I knew it , and I did n't know how .... Jim , I got a funny feeling we 're not alone . " " Come on , have another drink . " " No , I mean it . " " Well , for God 's sake , let 's have a look . " " O.K. , let 's . " She felt like some violin string , tuned to the point it breaks , and all over the place were footsteps , and then they stopped . Then : " Dasso , you 're seeing things . There 's nobody here . " " O.K. If I can put a little water in it , I 'll have that other drink . " " Help yourself . " The kitchen door squeaked , and in hardly a second it squeaked again . Then Dasso said : " Jim . " " Yeah ? "  | " That kettle 's hot . " There was the longest silence I ever heard , then the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , but of only one person . How long we stood it I do n't know . We just stood there and stood there and stood there . After a while her hand tightened on mine , and then loosened . Then her breath began to come in gasps . I knew she 'd pass out if I did n't do something . I opened the door . He was facing us , in one of the beach chairs on the other side of the gas log . When she staggered out of there , he sat like a stone . But when he could see who I was , he jerked up on his elbows for maybe a second , like he could hardly believe his eyes . Then he leaned back . But he did n't only lean . He shriveled into his clothes , so that what had been a big man seemed small . She sat on the table , and poured a spoonful of liquor into one of the glasses , drank it , and shivered . I sat down somewhere . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said : " This is why you would n't sing for me ? " " I guess so , Mr. Branch . " " And it started then , that Sunday ? " " Yes . " He turned to her : " Hannah , why did n't you tell me ? " " How could I ? " " But  --  there 's nothing you ca n't tell me . " " Would I stab a knife into you ? " " But I think you 've forgotten , it was what we said . I told you if ever there came anything you were to tell me . There 's nothing I could n't forgive you , Hannah  --  except not being frank with me . That makes me feel  --  all alone  --  left out of your life . I do n't know anything to do about it . "  | " I 'm sorry , Jim . " It came to me they were n't acting like a man and his wife . They were acting like a father and his child . Instead of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or somebody by the throat , he wa 's reasoning with her , being noble , or whatever it was . And she , instead of roaring around and asking what he was going to do about it , was acting meek and sorry and lowly , like some kid that played hooky from school . I said : " Can I say something to you two people ? " Neither one of them said anything , but I kept at it : " Never mind what I have to do with this . You know when you 're a heel or you do n't . But as to how things were before I got here , all I can say is that I think Hannah turned to you , Mr. Branch , at a time when she was pretty low about her father , and that what she reached for , even if she did n't know it , was n't a husband , but somebody to take the place of her father , and that 's why  --  " He cut me off : " We 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally . " You mean you fnew it ? " They did n't answer me , and then she began talking to him : " It all seemed so simple , Jim , and so wonderful , the way you said it . My father was gone , and you wanted to be a father to me , and take care of me , and see that no harm ever came  --  and you did . How could I try to tell you you did n't ? You did everything you said you 'd do , but you were a little late . I looked like a little girl to you , and some ways I was , but there were other ways you did n't know about . There were those years in college , and the years right after  --  and then I was n't a little girl any more . I was a wild dame , looking for a good time , and plenty grown-up . Oh , I was honest enough . I wanted our life the way we said , and I felt saintly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone , I 'd want to be wild again , and then  --  I popped off one day , that 's all . It 's not Jack 's fault . At least he would n't keep on wearing a surplice , and singing for you . You 've got to say that for him . " " I have n't chided him ... or you . " He poured himself some liquor , and I thought he drank it off pretty quick . Then he had some more . Then he asked her if her car was here , and when she said it was in the garage , he said he and she could take that and Dasso would drive me to the ranch , then gave her a little pat and said it was time they were getting home . She did n't move . He said it again , with all kinds of explanations about how of course he would forgive her , and more of the same , until my teeth began to go on edge , though I wanted her to make it up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to cry . He started to cry . I wanted to cry . He poured himself another drink and drank it , then had another and another . Then Dasso was there , tapping him on the shoulder , saying come on , the new shift was coming on , they 'd have to go . He got to his feet , picked up the bottle , drained the last of it , tried to set it down , and missed . I picked it up , put it on the table . He picked up the cork , put it back in the bottle . It took him five minutes . Then he went reeling to the door , Dasso 's arm around him . When I heard them drive off I lit the gas , went out in the kitchen and made coffee , and made her drink some . Then I put her to bed . I spread a blanket over her . I found a blanket for myself , wrapped it around me , and camped in a chair . When the sun came up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to figure where I was at with my life , if any.  |p243THE  Sunday after that I slept late , as spring means work on a fruit ranch , and I 'd had a hard week . Around ten o'clock , when I strolled over from breakfast , church bells were ringingsomewhere , and I had a wild notion to sing in the choir because I felt like it , and at last have peace , even if it had n't much glory attached to it , or much pay . It had been a week since I 'd seen her , and it seemed that maybe I never would again , and that I could forget about her , and everything she 'd mixed me up with , and especially Branch . It was n't all hope , either . One night , on a trip to Whittier with the light truck , I had taken a sneak to have a peep at the well . It was just like it had been , with the rotary table going around in the middle , a driller camped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side , giving orders . It looked like she did n't need me , and I might be out . That suited me fine . Becausecoming home that Monday morning , with her at the wheel saying nothing and the gray damp drifting in from the ocean , I 'd had a bad time . It had hit me all in a lump as it had n't before , that it was all very well to talk mean to her , and maybe she was cold and maybe she was wild and maybe she was bad , but it took two to cook up the kind of cross we had tried to get away with , and here at last I tumbled that one of them might be me . But a week had gone by , and I 'd heard nothing from her , and there was no getting around it , I might be out . This Sunday morning , though , I had hardly gone in the bunkhouse before there came a rap on a horn , fast , sharp , andp244nervous . I went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked over and said : " Well stranger , where you been keeping yourself ? " " Jack , I 've been keeping myself a good many places , and I 'm fine , and it 's a beautiful day , but  --  will you please get in so we can talk as we go and not take the whole day about it ? " " We in a hurry or something ? " " All hell has broken loose . " " . . . What kind of hell ? " " At the well ! Will you get in , so we can go ? " I got in , and we whizzed to 101 , and were leveled off for Long Beach before she went on : " It 's the police , and what they 're threatening to do to us if we do n't take care of the mud . It 's  --  all over the place and you 'll have to do something about it . " " All over what place ? " " The street ! " " If I 'm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the cuttings add to volume , and water is added too . So more comes out than goes in . The increase in volume makes an overflow . It has to be pumped somewhere . Generally a sump  --  a big sink banked up with dirt . But the man my husband made his arrangements with , on the next property , has changed his mind , or needs his sump himself , or something . He says it was on a personal basis with my husband , and now it 's different , or  --  I do n't know what he says , I have n't even seen him . But we 're cut off from his land , and we ca n't stop drilling and the mud 's running out into the street , and it 's a violation , and the police are there , and  --  " " Ca n't your husband do something ? " " He is n't there . " " Where is he ? " " At the Hilton . " " What 's he doing there ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , he was going to carry on for you till this well was down . Now he 's at the Hilton and he 's not carrying on . Come on , what 's happened ? " " He 's been drinking . " " On account of us ? " " I guess so . Jack , you 'll have to  --  " " Why ca n't Dasso do something ? " " He 's nothing but an employee . " I wanted to ask what I was , that I could do something , but as I 've said , I 'd got it through my head by then that it took two to make a mess like we had , and if I 'd started it , I had to finish it , or try to . We drove on , and pretty soon we were in Long Beach , and I kept trying to picture what the mud was like . And when we turned into the little street that led up Signal Hill , there it was , trickling down the ditch , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have on the upper Eastern Shore of Maryland . And there at the corner , where it was slopping down a grating into a drain , was a cop , poking it with a stick to keep it from caking . And on the other side of him were two firemen with a hose , playing water on it a little further up the hill , to keep it liquid , so it would n't choke the whole ditch . We went up the hill and all up and down my back I could feel this sick feeling , because I had no idea at all what I was going to do about it . At the well , except for cops in a car and the mud running out of a pipe into the ditch , things looked as usual . The driller was at his brake , the rotary table was spinning around , roughnecks were there , and Dasso was off to one side , talking with a police sergeant , who kept looking at his watch . When he saw us park , Dasso came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it . I 've told him we dare n't stop that drill , but he says we 've got ten minutes to get that mud under control , and if we do n't , he 's shutting us down . " Dasso was looking at her , but he was really talking to me . The officer came over and she pleaded with him and said to close the well down now would practically mean they 'd lose hundreds of feet of hole , and he said he realized that . He said he 'd given two hours already , and wanted to accommodate her every way he could . But , he said , the law was the law . Strictly speaking , he was obliged to shut her down now , but he did n't want to be any harder on her than he could help . She asked what he wanted her to do , and he said he did n't know , but that mud could n't indefinitely discharge into the street . Dasso began to whistle something , the cop looked me over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . I did n't know what I was going to do but I got out . Off to one side were two tanks that had been brought in to take care of production when the well started . I did n't know what they were doing there at that time , but I could see they were n't connected up with anything , and that they were empty . I made a quick flash and flashback with my eye , and it seemed to me if the mud pipe were turned at the elbow joint up near the well , the end of it , where the mud was pouring out , would just about swing over the nearest tank and would even reach the other . I went over , grabbed it in both hands , and pulled . It did n't move , so I called to the men for a little help . Then it turned and the mud splattered all over me . We walked the end around until it was over my head , where the ground fell away to the tanks . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push and then heard it drumming on metal , inside . I turned to Dasso : " That ought to hold you for a while . Soon as one fills , use the other . " Dasso 's glasses clouded from the venom in his eyes . Then he looked at her . " Yes , Daz , I think that 'll do it . " " ... Is he in charge now ? " " As my representative . " I turned to the cop : " As I figure it , those tanks will do it till tomorrow , when I 'll have a proper sump put in . " " Well , not quite till tomorrow , I 'd say . " " Violation 's taken care of for the present , is n't it ? "   " Well , yes sir , only  --  " " Then O.K. " I said it like a grand duke dismissing the barber , and he called to the cop down the hill and to the firemen , then went to the car and drove off , with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiss you  --  before you wash off that mud . " " Got no time . " I did n't need any cop to tell me I was talking much too optimistic about those tanks , that they could n't hold us any more than a couple of hours . I 'd be back where we started , if I did n't make a place to dump mud . For a minute I concentrated , trying to remember the name of the guy with the ditcher , but then I had it : Stelliger . I went in the shack they used for an office , looked him up , got him on the phone . I 'd hate to tell you what a hundred-per-cent American mechanic takes for a little Sunday emergency job , but pretty soon here he came , riding his ditcher , with his truck and shovel right behind . I started him in right away , on the hillside just above the drilling rig where the tanks were filling . With the ditcher , I had him make four deep trenches , then start in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling right in on the other . Then with the shovel , I had him begin loading loose dirt on the truck , dumping it at the other end of the property . If I looked around , I knew I could probably find some guy not so far away that was making land in a marsh somewhere , and get rid of my dirt there , but I did n't have time to look around . I dumped dirt where I could dump it , then the last few loads I piled it up around the hole I was making , and pretty soon it was a regular sump  --  not a very neat one , but a fair job for a rush order , and big enough to hold all the mud we 'd pump for quite a few days . When they were done she drew the check . " I 'm sorry , Hannah , at the cost , but  --  " " I 'm not . I 'm glad . " " But it had to be done , and  --  " " Will you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Me , if you want to . " The night shift had come on by then , and everything seemed to be going fine , so she took me to a drive-in , where we had sandwiches and coffee , and then to a little hotel on Anaheim Boulevard , where I called up Holtz and told him I was leaving . He raised holy hell , as I expected , and offered me more dough , which made me feel proud and sorry at the same time , but there was no help for it , I 'd taken over an oil well and had to see it through . As she was lending me her car , I took her home , had another look-in at the well , and finally went to the hotel and turned in . By sunup I was back on the job . Around noon Monday was when the trouble started . We were running mud into my makeshift sump by then , but I wanted to get things lined up right , so I got ready to make a regular sump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where the first well had been drilled . So you 'll get it straight , all that happened later , I better tell you how it was laid out . There were two streets , not any bigger than lanes , one going up the hill , the other across it , and her property lay right at the intersection . Over from her , next to the street that ran across the hill , was the cemetery . Up the tilted street , the one that ran over the top of the hill , and separated from her by nothing but a barbed-wire fence , was the little refinery , with its compressor unit in one corner . Out of every well comes oil and gas , and the gas is first trapped , then run into a compressorunit , or absorption plant as a big one is called , and the casing-head gasoline extracted . That 's the high-octane stuff that 's mixed with all good gas like Central American coffee is mixed with ordinary coffee , and for the same reason , to give it pep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something that will sell , or in the case of a big company with plenty ofP249dough to spend , to a cracking plant , which is the same as a refinery , except they do it under a pressure a refinery does n't have , and get all kinds of by-products the refineries miss . This refinery was a teapot , with three stills running gas fires , pipes leading to flash towers , bubble towers , storage tanks , and the rest of the stuff that goes with a job that stays on a half acre of ground . Her land was an acre , with six wells running along one side , by the barbed-wire fence , all with the derricks removed but pumps going , each with a gas trap , which is a little inverted tank about the size of a house hot-water tank , and two gauging tanks which are eight or ten feet high and maybe six feet across , the same kind I used for mud . They 're always set up in pairs , so one is filling while the other is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract with Luxor , or luXor , as they spelled it , and everywhere you looked was some kind of valve with their X on it , connecting with their lines that led to their plant , down the hill maybe a quarter of a mile . Near the refinery , on the other side of a wooden fence was another small independent like herself , named Mendel , the one that had let Branch use his sump , and then changed his mind . The new well was near Mendel 's fence , starting another row of six . The temporary sump I had made was right alongside of it , and the new sump , the bigger one I was going to build that would hold us a while , was at the lower end of her property . But on something of that size , I could n't jackleg the way I had on the little sump , so I told Stelliger to come on Tuesday , and that Monday morning drove up to Long Beach and found a place that had a second-hand transit . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began setting stakes for the grading . I 'd been at it maybe an hour when that sixth sense , or my ear maybe , told me something was wrong . I looked over . Dasso was nowhere around , but the guy on the mud pump was at the screen , looking down at the stuff that was flowing back over it , Then the driller noticed something and looked up . Then the pump gave two or three coughs , while the pump man dived for the throttle . He was too late . It blew out with a noise like a cannon . Steam roared all around , the driller reached for his throttle , and everything stopped . By one o'clock , a trouble-shooter was out there , from a pump company I found in the classified phone book , that I had to find somehow or other , if anything was to be done , as Dasso did n't show for an hour , on account , he said , of slipping down to the Hilton to see Branch . He acted like that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , I took a little walk around so I would n't blow my top and pretty soon that brought me to the refinery . On the other side of the fence a  --  guy was standing , watching what was going on . I guess he was around fifty , tall , thin , and leathery-looking , the way they all seemed to be in this business , and he had on the same overalls , canvas cap , and open shirt the rest of them wore . He spoke , and I did , and he told his name , which was Rohrer , and there did n't seem to be much to do but tell mine , which I did . He said he figured I was the new super on Seven-Star , which was the first I knew we had a name , and I said I was . He kept looking at me , like he was trying to . size me up , then said something that sounded like some kind of a feeler : " Always had a friendly place in my heart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I may say so . " " . . . How do you mean , Mr. Rohrer ? " " Well , they 've made their deal , or I hear they have , with Luxor , and it 's none of my business and year after year they pass me by . But between you and me and that gatepost over there , a little refinery can often switch things around , these days especially , in a way the big company ca n't . Or shall we say  --  wo n't ? "  |p251He  winked and I asked him if he ran the refinery and he said he did : " All by myself most of the time . Hits people funny , on an oil plant , that you do n't need a whole gang running around and eating lunch when the whistle blows at noon . They forget it all works on valves and gauges and shut-offs , and one man , if he knows what he 's doing , can handle it just as good as twenty . " " If he knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're kind of new here . " " Well  --  just a little . " " As we all are  --  once . " He studied the gang for a while , then said : " Little trouble , I see , with your pump . " " Blew a cylinder head on me . " " Unusual , nowadays .... Used to be , a pump would blow out almost any time , but not now , the way they get corings whenever they want , and can tell what they 've got . Mr. Dillon , just from what I know of the formation they 're into down there , I 'd say that mud needs conditioning . There 's a lot of material over there , piled up over there in bags , but I have n't seen one pound of it dumped in all morning . " Then , as I could feel my face get hot , on account of never having heard of weight material , he went on : " You 're new here , as we 've said , and you probably do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch what you 're in , from the corings , and keep the mud at proper consistency , to control its viscosity and weight as required , and it has to be him that 's responsible . And  --  speaking of matters of that kind , I 'd say yesterday was a very funny time to get caught short of a mud sump , and still funnier time with nobody around to see where the stuff was running , for somebody accidentally on purpose to put in a call for an officer . " " ... What are you getting at , Mr. Rohrer ? " " I told you I felt friendly ? " " You sure did . "   " Keep your eyes open , boy . " I went back to the pump , and they had it going again . The guy from the pump company checked two or three things , then said to me : " Mister , it 's all the same to us , and fixing pumps is our business . Just the same , unless you want to have this trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I 'd keep an eye on the consistency of that mud . " I thanked him , watched how the roughnecks kind of looked at each other , and at Dasso , who stood there shaking his head . I let it jell on that basis , and then , kind of easy , without getting excited , I said to him : " Dasso , I think he means you . " " Means  --  who did you say ? " " Were you watching it ? " " Well  --  I was n't here , Jack . I  --  " " Inhere were you ? " " I told you . I was at the Hilton . Mr. Branch  --  " " Nobody came to me for leave to go to the Hilton . Myself , I was putting down stakes . I ca n't build sumps , watch the condition of mud , and do eighteen other things you 're supposed to do . Now if you want to stay on here , I got to know if you 're where you 're supposed to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , lolligagging all over the place on things I 'm not even informed about . Now which is it going to be ? " " O.K. , but if a goddam pump man ca n't  --  " " He does n't issue materials . " He stood blinking at me , and he was n't kidded : he knew I did n't know . But when I 'd stood up for my pump engineer , that put the men on my side , and for that round he had to go along . The trouble-shooters left , he pulled down two bags of Aquajel to dump in the tank . But we 'd lost plenty of time . " Hannah , it 's just plain sabotage , and the guy is out to throw a monkey wrench into us every way there is , and
