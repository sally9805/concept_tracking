txt PENNANT FOR DODGERS Fan Makes Optimistic Comment Citing Edge Over Giants To Sports Editor of The New York Times : After reading Arthur Daley 's article concerning Eddie Brannick and the Brooklyn Dodgers in THE TIMES on Tuesday , I thought that Mr. Brannick must have forgotten the Giants . For a person connected with the Giants to belittle the Dodgers the ' way Mr. Brannick did makes me think that something is wrong . - There is n't any comparison between the Dodgers and Giants , for the simple reason that the Brooklyn club is so much superior . , Analyzing the teams , position by position , as did Mr. Brannick when he so ably tore the Dodgers apart , I find that the Giants are better at second base and in right field . The third basemen and center fielders are on a par , but the Dodgers excel at the other five positions . The Brooklyn pitching staff is much finer , for the only Giant hurlers above the ordinary are Cliff Melton and Bill Lohrman . As for Mr. Brannick 's comments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by August " they 'll have to move him around in a wheel chair . " Vaughan far overshadows Billy Jurges , the Giant shortstop . And Vaughan not only will complete the season ; he 'll do better than that by finishing out the world series . A DODGER FAN . Montclair , N. J. , April 28 , 1943 . Editorial Note : Horrors ! Have Brooklyn admirers become conservatives ? In his final sentence this fellow predicted the Dodgers would win the National League pennant only .
