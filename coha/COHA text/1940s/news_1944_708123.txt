txt Fifteen hundred friends and neighbors gathered in front of the home of Richard J. Lyons in Libertyville last night to wish him success . In Libertyville , the Republican nominee for the United States senate is known to old and young as Dick . Part of the crowd assembled in Cook Memorial park in the center of the business district and paraded to the Lyons home four blocks away . Searchlights powered by fire department trucks illuminated the big white stucco house , which was decorated with flags and bunting . Lyons Deeply Moved . As the parade approached , led by a band , the crowd pressed around ' the house , overflowed the lawn and stretched into the street . Mr. and Mrs. Lyons stepped out on the porch to wave a greeting . Mrs. Lyons , wearing a black dress , was smiling , poised , and gracious . Her husband , a hard hitting , fast talking man at most political meetings , appeared almost diffident as if he were deeply moved by the ovation from his neighbors . After brief speeches by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other notables , Lyons was called to the microphone . He thanked the throng and said , " No matter what I do or where I go in the life of the nation , I will never forget my friends in the grandest community on the face of the earttiff Reception in House . Mrs. Lyons then invited the throng to pass thru a reception line in the house . In the back yard , a women 's committee served doughnuts , and a men 's committee served coffee . Mrs. Lyons worried a bit for fear the men might not make good coffee , but it turned out all right . The party was not sponsored by the Republican party organization in Lake county . It was a spontaneous , sincere expression of friendship to a man who started his career without money or Influential friends , and became one of the best known citizens in Illinois . A committee of citizens waited on Mr. and Mrs. Lyons several weeks ago and told them about plans for the party . They demurred , express . ing fear that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry about that , " replied William E. Webster , co-chairman of the celebration . " We want to honor you , not because Dick is a candidate , but because you are our friends and neighbors . There are Republicans and Democrats on this committee . We feel also that Dick has brought great credit to the name Or Ltnertyvnie anu therefore we owe him a kind of debt . " Delegations from many towns in Lake county attended the party . There was a large group from Mundelein , which adjoins Libertyville and which claims an equal share in Lyons as a home town boy . He once ran a grocery in Mundelein and later had a real estate business there . Bob Rouse , who has been mayor of Mundelein for 25 years , recalled yesterday that he advised Lyons against entering the grocery business back in 1919 . Lyons a Good Neighbor . Another old friend of the Lyons family in Mundelein is William Eddy , who runs a barber shop and bowling alley . He recalled that Lyons was one of the early radio fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood . " Dick always had a crowd in his house , " Eddy said . " He likes everybody . He is n't just a political back slapper ; he 's a good neighbor . He 's been doing favors for people all his life . And he always has worked hard . He has educated himself , largely by reading . He 's the darnedest fellow about staying up late reading . " Another view of Lyons was given by Otto J. Boehm , insurance and real estate man in Libertyville and a Lake county supervisor . Called a Typical American . " Dick is a typical American , as we like to think of America , " he said . " This is the only country in the world where such a man of the people could rise to prominence . Here , in his home town , we like him and respect blm , and we believe he will be a good senator , not only for us , but for the whole nation . I do n't believe he would over do anything mean or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of the nation . He is simple and sincere . To us he is always Dick , and he would be the same if he were the President of the United States . "
