" In the hills and forests the Maquis* of France band together in common need and against the common enemy-Vichy and the Germans . Usually they are absorbed in just existing-getting food and avoiding capture . But a month ago one band gave fight with two unusual advantages-sufficient arms and trained Army leaders . The story of their fight was told in Algiers last week by Commissioner Emmanual d'Astier de la Vigerie . <P> The Maquis , about 600 strong , were entrenched on the Plateau des Glires , a tableland in southeastern France near the Swiss border . To wipe them out , the Germans massed an estimated 12,000 men , much artillery , squadrons of planes , planned to open with an artillery barrage . The French fooled them . <P> Instead of awaiting attack in their trenches , they sent a third of their men out under an army lieutenant , caught the Nazis off balance . Making good use of cover , the little French force confused a portion of the Germans into believing they were surrounded by a much larger force . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French lieutenant was suddenly shot and his hidden men angrily reopened fire , then returned with 60 Nazi prisoners . <P> For eleven more days the French held their plateau against German siege and attack . Food and munitions were smuggled to them by other Maquis bands . Frustrated , the Germans withdrew to reorganize their attack . Then , at night , most of the French slipped quietly away . <P> German losses in men were estimated at 250 , five times the French casualties . German loss of face was incalculable . <P> * Literally : Corsican scrub , traditional refuge for lawbreakers ; now the term for Frenchmen hiding from Occupation demands . Most Maquis haunt the Haute-Savoie , near Switzerland .
