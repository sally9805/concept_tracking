When Pierre Laval took the reins of Vichyfrance , many U.S. citizens thought that U.S.-Vichy relations were all over but the shooting . Not so the State Department . U.S. diplomats thought up a new device to put Laval on the spot . One morning last week Rear Admiral John H. Hoover and State Department 's Samuel Reber landed at Vichy 's Caribbean island of Martinique , went straight to the offices of bearded Admiral Georges Robert , High Commissioner of Vichy 's possessions in the area ( Martinique , sister island Guadeloupe and French Guiana ) . <P> The Americans were there to get guarantees against use by the Axis of any French possessions in the Caribbean . Purpose : to lock up the French warships in the area-the aircraft carrier Barn and the cruiser Emile Berlin at Martinique , the cruiser Jeanne D'Arc at Guadeloupe-and some 100-odd weather-damaged fighter planes . <P> The U.S. already had such an agreement with Admiral Robert-but it was pre-Laval . Now the U.S. asked Robert to sign on the dotted line all over again . It looked simple-behind Admiral Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. naval bases , strung between Trinidad and Puerto Rico . In Washington this week French Ambassador Gaston Henry-Haye said his Government ( i.e. , Laval ) had not told him to protest . <P> If Admiral Robert agrees and signs , all New World Frenchmen become a brand-new third kind of Frenchmen . Completely isolated from Europe , they will not be Vichyfrench , nor will they be Free French . This means a division of the French Empire into three main parts , not two . Just as unhappy as Laval was General de Gaulle , who was left out in the cold . <P> One of the shrewdest aspects of the maneuver was its propagandistic effect . Once again , in plainest terms , the U.S. had informed the people of France that Pierre Laval could not be trusted ; that he was an Axis tool ; that Americans would help Frenchmen anywhere under any circumstances except when they willingly give outright aid to Hitler .
