txt The first formal statement that the Administration might receive additional amendments to the , lend-lease bill further restricting the proposed grants of power to President Roosevelt was made today by Speaker Sam Rayburn after attending a meeting of Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . " Serious consideration , " Mr. Rayburn said , is being given the whole matter . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard James S. Kern-per , head of the United States Chamber of Commerce , declare that the present bill " would not contribute to the defense of the United States . " while Dr. Alan Valentine , President of the University of Rochester , and other opposition witnesses charged that it would inevitably lead the country into war . The House started its third day of general debate on the bill before taking up the thorny matter of amendments tomorrow , prefatory to final disposition expected Friday . Galleries were again crowded as debate started and at one point a hysterical woman dressed in black and wearing a painted skull mask arose , in the public gallery shouting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representative Ed . V. Izak ( D ) , of California , a one-time recipient of the Congressional Medal , as the debate re-opened , predicted that , without further American aid , Britain would sign a negotiated peace which would not stop Hitler . Today 's debate turned largely on the subject of amendments although their formal consideration is not scheduled till tomorrow . Hitherto . Speaker Rayburn has minimized the possibility of further restrictive amendments . The door seems at least part way open , following a Democratic strategy meeting and the non-partisan appeal of Representative James W. Wadsworth ( ft ) . of New York , on the floor yesterday . " The committee in charge of the bill is giving serious consideration to amendments , " Mr. Rayburn said . " Nothing has been arrived at as yet . " He said the proposed amendments receiving the most consideration would : I. Place some sort of limitation on the ' power of the President to make contractural commitments . 2 .

Fix some ceiling on the amount of money the President may spend in the British aid program . Rayburn Favors No Limit Mr. Rayburn said that he personally opposed fixing a ceiling on expenditures to be made in aiding Britain . " No one knows how much this will cost or what money or credits will be available for use by the British , " he said . He added there might be a " psychological value " to such an amendment but had no idea what it might be . If a maximum of $5,000,000 , - 000 for example were fixed in the bill , he said , the way would be opened for a charge that the President was being given a " blank check . " It might be more advisable , Mr. Rayburn observed , to leave the way open for periodical appropriations by Congress , possibly on an annual basis . President Roosevelt would have the authority under the bill in its present form to make American arms available to the British the moment it becomes law and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Representative John W.

Strout Staff Correspondent 01 The Christian Science Monitor WASHINGTON , Feb. 5 ? James S. Kemper , President of the United States Chamber of Commerce , appearing as opposition witness to the lend-lease bill before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today , cited and amplified objections to the bill unanimously stated by the Chamber 's Board of Directors . The Board of Directors , he said , unanimously held that " the enactment of this legislation would not contribute to the national defense , " and urged instead a series of laws to give credit and money and munitions to Britain , but without delegation of Congressional authority to the President , and without taking the United States into war . Another witness , Dr. Alan Valentine , President of the University of Rochester , charged that supporters of the lend-lease bill are seeking to carry the nation into war , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony caused a Committee sensation , because it seemed to align the leaders of American business strongly against the Administration measure and with that section of the Republican minority in Congress which is vigorously attacking it . The Chamber 's opposition was expressed , however , before the four amendments were adopted by the House Committee limiting the President 's authority . Arc Views of Membership Mr. Kemper explained that the resolutions attacking the bill were adopted by the meeting of the Chamber 's Board of Directors in Chicago last month . Thirty-eight of the 48 Directors were present at the meeting , Mr. Kemper said . The resolutions were originally drawn up by the National Policy Council of the Chamber , he said , and approved by the Board of Directors . Mr. Kemper said they represented the views of the Chamber membership as expressed in previous votes of annual meetings . Senator Tom Connally ( D ) of Texas , administration supporter . raked Mr. Kemper over the coals in cross-examination , until Mr. Kemper exclaimed : " I want you to know I am not on trial at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , in part : The bill now before your committee was carefully studied and analyzed by the National Policz Council of the Chamber . Thereafter , its recommendations Nvere presented to the Board of Directors which , without a dissenting vote , expressed the conviction that the enactment of this legislation would not contribute ter the defense of the United States and that , under the circumstances , the bill should not , in its present form at least , become the law of the land . Some Specifications Among the several objections recorded by the BOarCi to the enactment of S-275 are the following : ( A ) The President is =pecifkali ) * excluded from the restraining intleenee of any law : ( B ) The President can . without the knowledge of the Congress , and over the objection of our Army , Naval and Air experts , deliver not only to the British Empire , but to other unnamed countries , all or a part of our Navy , all or a part of our airplanes. , all or a part of our tanks , guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill is not clear in this respect , it is fairly debatable whether the President can , regardless of law , seize the private property of a military character , or susceptible of military uses , of any individual , firm or corporation , regardless of the wishes and welfare of the owner , regardless of the knowledge of the Congress and regardle.z.s of the views of our 0 , , en military experts , and turn such properties over to unnamed countries : ( D ) The President can spend public funds or incur , or have incurred , on behalf of the Government of the United States , financial obligations not limited in amount , not only without the consent but without the prior knowledge of the Congress ; ( E ) the vast powers proposed to be vested in the President , whoever he may be , by this bill have no limit as to time . Want Check on President Mr. Kemper said there had been no objection to the Board 's position by any local chamber of commerce . " You 'd rather trust Congress than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , is n't it ? " demanded Senator Alben W. Barkley ( D ) of Kentucky , " We 'd rather have a check on . the President , rather than have Congress abdicate and go home , " witness retorted . Democratic senators evidently accepted Mr. Kemper as a formidable antagonist and subjected him to sharper questioning than any opposition spokesman who has yet appeared . - " Is it an act of war to sell mu-. nitions to Britain ? " asked Senator Barkley . " By whom ? " said Mr. Kemper . " By the Government . " " Yes I would say it is . " " Then you would n't do something as an ' act of war , ' " declared , Senator Barkley , " which your board recommends the Government should do to aid Britain . " New Conditions Under ? Bill The recommendation to which Senator Barkley referred was a resolution approved by the Board " to sell , lease , or give such military properties as now or hereafter may belong to the United States , as may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof , to the British Empire without committing any recognized act of war . " Mr. Kemper explained that conditions would be different if the present bill were passed . He was sharp in some of his replies and senators found him a difficult witness . To one question put by Senator Wallace White ( R ) of Maine , he replied abruptly , " Well , what do you think ? " And to a question on alleged World War profiteering by Senator Claude Pepper ( D ) of Florida , with whom he repeatedly clashed , he flatly replied , " I wo n't answer that , " Mr , Kemper declined to go into his personal views on the pending bill . preferring to appear merely as representative of the Chamber . " Yau do n't need the present bill to aid Britain , " witness said . He asserted the bill applied " to anyone , anywhere . " " The bill 's full of loose language , " he exclaimed at one point . Senator Pepper pressed him on his ii , : ertion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying that " all the aid Britain needed was in one clause . " Aside From the Question Senator Pepper and Mr. Kemper clashed repeatedly as Senator Pepper cross-examined him . The Senator wanted to know what the Chamber of Commerce had done to prevent profiteering , and Mr. Kemper said that he did n't see what that question had to do with the bill . Senator Pepper asked him whether he knew of any manufacturers who had offered to manufacture defense articles at cost , or at a profit of 1 per cent , and Mr. Kemper repeated his objection . The Chamber of Commerce head said that no anti-profiteering steps were necessary because " business is doing a swell job , co-operating without reference to profit and at the risk of considerable losses . " Later , however , witness told Senator Green of Rhode Island that his organization . would not oppose reasonable excess profits legislation . In all cases , he said , the Chamber places the interests of the public first . " Profiteering-is evidenced by excess profits , " he said .

Want War , Educator Says " We should help Britain , yes , but only to the extent that such help does not weaken our own self-defense , " said Dr. Valentine , who added that " those who support the bill have done their utmost , by every form of propaganda , to convince the American people that , at whatever cost to America , Britain must be aided to whatever extent is necessary to insure British victory . " He continued : " No matter what many of the aid-short-of-war supporters of this bill may say , we know that they would have us go to war . " Dr. Valentine explained that he was a Rhodes Scholar and had lived in Britain three years . " If this war can be won by anyone , " he said , he favored Britain , but he said he opposed the logic which made supporters of Britain attack a negotiated peace between England and Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid should be given Britain sufficient " to conquer Germany on the Continent of Europe . " Declares People Frightened In coolness , self-possession and point of view D. Valentine , was somewhat reminiscent ' of Colonel Lindbergh , though he did not go to the extremes of " neutrality " which the latter expressed . Advocates of the bill , he argued , " have succeeded in confusing and frightening the American people , and are fast pushing them over the brink into war . " He continued : " My objections to that bill are simple . The bill delegates to one man full power to control completely the industrial life of America down to the smallest factory , for it authorizes full control of the manufacture of all defense materials , and defines defense materials so broadly that they include anything that floats or flies or could be used to injure an enemy , or anything that could contribute to the manufacture of any of these . " This amounts to the abnegation of Congress , the nullification of property rights , the centering of complete economic power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President needs all this power ? If he intends to use it , he kills the fundamentals of democratic procedure . If he does not intend to use it , why should he have it ? " Ironically he declared : " With dictatorial powers he Will protect democracy . The only difJerence between a good dictator and a bad one is a matter of time , ' ' Dr. Valentine urged rejection of the present bill and its replace ' ment by legislation to speed home defense and to " give financial and material assistance to Great Britain provided such aid is in each instance formally approved by Congress , thus preserving the right of the people , through Congress , to determine whether each step is in their opinion in the national interest . " He later said , under questioning , that he felt he had gone too far in his all-inclusive condemnation of all of those who support the bill as seeking to carry the Nation into war , and of using " every form of propaganda .
