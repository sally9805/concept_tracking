For weeks the New York stockmarket has dawdled while buyers tried to make up their minds about the war . Last week , they came to a decision they were willing to bet on : Germany will last for another six months , at least . Result : the market surged upwards in five successive million-share days . And the bellwether Dow-Jones industrial averages , which reclined in the optimistic days of last September , rose to their highest point , 151 , since January 1940 . <P> Surprisingly , the rush of buying was started again by the rail stocks , though most of the roads chugged past their profit peaks months ago . But at the prospect of heavy war traffic for most of 1945 , the Johnny-come-latelies thought there was still time to climb aboard . Even such second-graders as Illinois Central helped lead the rush that put the rails at their peak since 1937 . <P> From them , the buying spread right across the board as buyers looked for undervalued stocks . Sears , Roebuck and Loose-Wiles went to new highs for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom , climbed right along with them . Typical example : Loew 's , Inc. , not cheap at 71 , went up ten points in the last ten days . As usual , the market was also full of bargain hunters , shopping among the cheap stocks . As a result , many of the blue chips , notably General Motors and U.S. Steel , lagged , were still below their year 's peaks . Furthermore , many a war stock , which had dropped a few months ago , was now being eagerly snapped up again . <P> But the prospects of a longer war , and a postponement of the uncertainties of reconversion , were not the only shoulders holding up the market . The plain fact was that there was plenty of idle money and the things which it could buy were becoming fewer &; fewer . There was no place for it to go but into the market .
