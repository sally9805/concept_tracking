Stealthily through a Solomons channel a Jap Kongo Class battleship slipped near dusk on Oct. 25 . A squad of Navy SBDs dive-bombed it , streaked back to Guadalcanal . A half-hour later six Army Flying Fortresses swung over the channel . From a tight , high-level formation they straddle-bombed the ship , scored two square hits . The battleship turned 45 degrees , headed north . Suddenly a magazine let loose . Fire leaped from bow to stern . The ship stopped dead . For hours the calm South Pacific sky and sea were lighted by flames until at midnight the battleship sank . <P> Navy communiqus have not yet credited Army bombers with sinking the battleship but other sources have verified it as " one of the great air stories of the war , " a feat of one Bombardment Group ( designation secret ) . It was the high mark in the crack battle record of that group and its Flying Fortresses . From their arrival on Guadalcanal in August until November , they had met the enemy 500 times , shot down 113 Jap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week a Distinguished Service Medal was on the way to the Group 's Commander , Brigadier General La Verne George ( " Blondie " ) Saunders , a blackly hirsute Irishman who got his ill-fitting nickname and a reputation for indefatigable practical jokery at West Point . <P> The reputation held long after he had become one of the Air Corps ' best pilots . But in 1940 a change began to come over rollicking Blondie . Assigned to Hickam Field , Hawaii , he was made Commander of a Flying Fortress outfit . And Blondie became serious , sobersided , calculating . On Dec. 7 , Saunders was taxiing a Fortress across the field when Jap planes shot it from under him . He tried another , with the same result . It made him coldly furious . <P> Charged with forming and training a new Bombardment Group , Saunders sweated until he had whipped his Group into combat shape . <P> By August , his planes were dropping down on Henderson Field , Guadalcanal , then a clearing barely big enough for a Fortress to land . Saunders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , established air supply lines for gasoline , parts and crews . At heart still a tackle ( West Point 1924-25 ) , Blondie was a Flying Commander , too , led many a bombing mission . On a raid over the Shortland Islands his pilot and co-pilot were killed . Saunders took the controls , crash-landed on a beach from which he and other survivors were picked up next day . <P> Last Christmas Day Saunders and his chief executive , Major Jack Malloy , were summoned to headquarters of the Solomons ' Air Commander , Major General Millard Harmon , for a cocktail party . In the midst of festivities COMSOUPAC Admiral William F. Halsey showed up , read an order , pinned on flustered Blondie the stars of a brigadier general . <P> Stammered Saunders , mindful of his Bombardment Group : " Fifteen hundred men are pinning those stars on my shoulders .
