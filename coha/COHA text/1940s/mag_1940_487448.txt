LORD HALIFAX STARTS HIS NEW JOB WITH two serious handicaps  --  his record as chief assistant to the late Neville Chamberlain in the appeasement campaign and the fact that he represents the ruling class whose privileged position in Britain has become a complete anachronism . He is said now to be as determined as Churchill to stand firm until Nazism is smashed , but his actions will have to make that very plain before his past ceases to raise suspicions in the minds of American liberals . The willingness of Lord Halifak to seek a modus vivendi with Hitler and his inability to realize the nature of the Third Reich are still among the unsolved mysteries of British politics . For the new Ambassador is a deeply religious man , with personal integrity and a profound moral sense . How , then , could he have failed to be outraged by the Nazi persecutions of Jews and Christians ? How is it that he did not instinctively grasp the fact that Hitler 's terror , far from being mere scum on the " wave of the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no compromise was possible ? Until his unfortunate appointment as Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had enjoyed a reputation as an enlightened Tory , and as Viceroy of India he had shown an unprecedented breadth of imagination . We hope the American atmosphere will assist the resurrection of the Halifax of the twenties . His successor at the Foreign Office , Anthony Eden , now has a chance to prove himself more than a " glamour boy . " The test will be his ability to rally to Britain 's side all those elements in Europe which look to it for leadership in a new democratic order . * BERLIN 'S OUTBURST OF RAGE AGAINST THE United States was based on a rather casual speech made by the British Minister of Shipping , who suggested that Axis merchant vessels now in American ports might be handed over to Britain . This gave the German spokesman 's tirade an air of spontaneity , but , for all that , it showed evidence of careful calculation , and if Mr. Cross had not pros ided an occasion , it is probable that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past it has been Dr. Goebbels 's policy to foster general disparagement of the United States as one of the " plutodemocracies " but not to attack very seriously specific measures of American aid to Britain . Actions such as the destroyer deal were treated as unfriendly but not likely to influence the outcome of the war . Long before this country would be able to send significant quantities of material to Britain , it was suggested , the war would be concluded by a total German victory . Now , apparently , the Nazi press is to play a new tune , with shrill notes of protest and a thumping bass of threats . What is the reason for this change of tactics ? We suspect that once again Hitler has revised his time-table of conquest and fears that American help to the enemy may become only too effective . * GERMAN REACTIONS TO THE DISMISSAL OF Laval confirm the belief that he was completely in Hitlers ' pocket and was ready to commit France to measures of cooperation too strong for Marshal Petain to stomach . The armed reconnaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reinstatement of a loyal henchman . It did not succeed , but the Nazi envoy was able to rescue Laval from house arrest and to carry him off to Paris . There , no doubt , he will be kept , in reserve in case relations with Vichy become too strained and need arises for a 100 per cent puppet government . Another concession to Nazi pressure was the appointment of Fernand de Brinon as delegate-general of the French gevernment in the occupied zone . This puts negotiations with the German authorities in the hands of a pro-Nazi of long standing , who was saved from arrest as a fifth columnist while the Reynaud government was in office only by his flight to Switzerland . However , the final say about the extent of Franco-German collaboration rests with Petain , who so far shows no sign of yielding to demands for the use of French bases and the French fleet against Britain . Yet German need of such assistance is growing with the losses suffered by Italy . The possibility of Nazi occupation of the whole of France has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. A. by The Nation , Inc. , 55 Fifth Avenue , New York , N. Y. Entered se second-class matter , December 13 , 1879 , at the Post Office of New York , N. Y .. under the act of March 3 , 1879. mooted in case Petain maintains his stand . This would give Hitler Toulon , but it might easily mean the return to the side of Britain of the French Empire and the fleet . * THREE MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY staff in Paris are to be recalled on the demand of the German government , which charges them with helping a British officer to escape and concealing a British secret agent . Mr. Hull has declared that a preliminary investigation shows that these officials had not been implicated in any wrongful act . Nevertheless , he added , any government has the right to request the withdrawal of officials of another government without submitting any reason for the demand . This , be it noted , is not a one-way rule , and we hope the Administration will hasten to emphasize that fact by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consuls who have been especially active in fifth-column work here . * VICTORIA KENT , ONE OF SPAIN 'S MOST distinguished women as well as one of its most ardent republicans , has been seized by the Gestapo in Paris and turned over to Franco . Ten years ago Miss Kent created something of a sensation in Spain by obtaining first honors in Madrid University as a doctor of law . She began her career as a lawyer by defending the Spanish leaders who were tried as a result of their participation in the first republican attempt of December , 1930 , the prologue to the overthrow of the monarchy . She was later elected a member of parliament and was very active in the working out of the Spanish constitution . After that she represented in the Cortes the moderate republican tendency of Sefior Azafia . The end of the civil war found her in Paris as secretary of the Loyalist embassy . She remained in Paris even after the Nazi troops entered the city and devoted herself to the relief of Spanish children still in France . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military court . * WE KNOW THAT THE GESTAPO RULES PARIS . The rapidly fading myth that it does not control the men of Vichy is now dispelled completely by the news that Spanish Loyalist leaders are being arrested and held in jail in unoccupied France . Largo Caballero , Portela Valladares , and Mariano AnsO are among those arrested . Sefior Caballero , who is seventy-three , is well known , having been head of the Loyalist government in the first part of the civil war . Portela Valladares was a minister under the monarchy and Prime Minister in the conservative government in power during the elections of 1936 , which brought about the victory of the People 's Front . When the Nazi and Fascist aviation moved into Spain , he aligned himself at once on the side of the Loyalists , who had been his political opponents . Senor AnsO , a lawyer , was Minister of Justice in the Negrin Cabinet until 1938 . Washington is reputed to have influence in Madrid and Vichy . It should be used , and quickly , in behalf of Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAVE COME FROM Mr. Roosevelt than the message with which he vetoed the Walter-Logan bill . " The very heart of modern reform , " the President said , lies in the administrative tribunal , and " great interests . . . which desire to escape regulation " believe they can destroy reform laws " by sterilizing the administrative tribunal which administers them . " Mr. Roosevelt 's description of the administrative tribunal is clear and admirable . " A common-sense resort to usual and practical sources of information takes the place of archaic and technical application of rules of evidence , and an informed and expert tribunal renders its decisions with an eye that looks forward to results rather than backward to precedent . . . . " The Walter-Logan bill would have served in effect to repeal not only much of the New Deal 's social legislation but much that preceded it . And the vote in the House to override the veto , though not sufficient to do so , showed that a majority in that body either does not understand or does not sympathize with the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , and called forth the President 's old scorn for the profession in his veto message . The lawyers , he said , in a fine passage , " prefer the stately ritual of the courts . . . to the simple procedure of administrative hearings . . . prefer . . . shrewd play upon technical rules of evidence . . . prefer to . . . juggle leading cases rather than to get down to the merits . " The lawyers have n't been so eloquently trounced since the mob scene in Henry IV . * THE NEW NO FOREIGN WAR COMMITTEE , headed by Verne Marshall , editor of the Cedar Rapids Gazette , insists that it is not made up of " appeasers , " but a close examination of its leadership reveals ominous characteristics . The man who is given credit for organizing the committee and who serves as its director is 0 . K. Armstrong of Springfield , Missouri . Mr. Armstrong , a close friend of Charles Lindbergh , leaped into notoriety some months ago when , as a member of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treason in the Schools for the Legion magazine , denouncing as subversive some thirty-eight textbooks used in the schools . Confronted with a demand for evidence to substantiate his charges , he was forced to admit that he was not familiar with all the texts he had denounced and , in some cases at least , he withdrew his charges . The Legion magazine apologized and retracted in other instances , and Mr. Armstrong was dropped from December 28 , 1940 the Legion 's foreign-relations committee . Verne Marshall , chairman of the committee , has been engaged for many years in a similar campaign against progressive textbooks in Cedar Rapids . A prominent speaker at the meeting held in Washington on October 21 at which the committee was organized was Merle Thorpe of the Nation 's Business , which last spring featured an article denouncing radical textbooks . For all its homespun , small-town look , the financial and political roots of the new committee strike into the same soil that nourishes the America First outfit ; they may even be intertwined * WESTBROOK PEGLER , THE DISTINGUISHED author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents to the refugee problem . Someone has told Mr. Pegler , who writes well but does n't read , that France fell to the fascists because it had carelessly allowed all kinds of anti-fascists to come in and escape the headsmen of the dictators . Some of these must have been Communists , Mr. Pegler thinks , and even though most of them were dumped into concentration camps he guesses they had a good part in the doing-in of the French Republic . Now Mr. Pegler , faithful watchdog that he is , sees America threatened with the same danger through the machinations of " tricky , abusive , and high-handed " Harold Ickes . Just because refugees may rot to death in foul camps or get themselves shot by the Gestapo while waiting for visas , passports , and other necessary paraphernalia , this madman Ickes wants to let them use the Virgin Islands as a way-station where , whether they have credentials or not , they can wait in safety until the red tape is unraveled . Does Ickes think he can fool Mr. Pegler with that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reason that the " greater proportion of them the refugees will be Communists who fled over the border into France after the Spanish Civil War and other Communists who , earlier in the general European revolution now in full eruption , escaped from Italy and Germany . " Scratch an anti-fascist , he implies , and you 're likely to find a Communist . But wait . Has n't Mr. Pegler w ritten many a column about Nazi murderers and fascist thugs ? Can it be that Mr. Pegler is ? ? Oh , no Still , he might be . It 's pretty suspicious . * IN OKLAHOMA CITY MERE MEMBERSHIP IN the Communist Party is regarded as a crime punishable by imprisonment for ten years and a fine of $5,000 . This vindictive sentence was passed on Robert Wood , state secretary of the party in October , and has now been repeated in the case of Alan Shaw , twenty-two-year-old secretary of the Oklahoma City local . In neither case was any overt act charged . Both men were convicted of violating the state criminal-syndicalism law on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marx , Lenin , and Stalin . Since the ideas put forward in these books were those of Communist leaders , it was charged , they must also be subscribed to by the accused . It would be difficult to find a more-flagrant example of judicial outrage of the Bill of Rights , but a case in neighboring Arkansas runs it close . Here the Commonwealth Labor College at Mena has been fined $2,500 , and though the case is under appeal , all its goods , including its library , have been seized and put on the auction block for the purpose of satisfying the judgment . The college was accused of propagating anarchism , of displaying an unlawful emblem , and of not displaying the American flag on September 23 . With regard to the last count the law requires all schools , when in session , to fly the flag , but on the date in question the college was already closed permanently and its affairs were being wound up . The " unlawful " emblem proved to be a crude representation of the hammer and sickle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen staff . The charge of anarchy was based mainly on passages from Marxist books in use at the college , for in the enlightened state of Arkansas anarchism and communism are just different names for the same thing .
