New Jersey 's Governor Walter Evans Edge said bluntly : " The public interest in primary elections has become so apathetic they might as well be abolished . " <P> The Governor , whose own slate won the Republican primary by 5-to-1 majorities , had no ax to grind . The facts were enough . In industrial New Jersey , where even the busiest war worker could find some time to vote during the 13-hour poll day , they straggled into the polls at the rate of six an hour . Nowhere except in Frank Hague 's well-regimented Hudson County did the vote exceed 15% of the registration , either Democratic or Republican . <P> The pathetic Jersey showing was a low point in a nationwide war trend . Even in the Wisconsin primary , where Wendell Willkie staked his Presidential chances on the outcome , only 33% of the qualified bothered to vote . Forty years ago reformers crusaded for primaries in the confidence that they would " take Government out of the hands of the politicians and return it to the people . " Now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care .
