txt Discouraging Alcohol Addicts In your issue of Dec. 29 you quote a report on alcohol by a scientist before the American Association for the Advancement of Science  --  that it was a " popular misconception " of physicians and laymen that drinking could be controlled by will power , resolutions or abstinence pledges . This seems to me a most mischievous thing to assert . It tends to weaken the efforts of drink addicts who are earnestly trying , and many who have succeeded in overcoming this habit , by will power and a growing sense of proper pride and duty to family and public . I personally know many who have succeeded and are now leading decent , normal lives . We get these amazing suggestions by specialists from time to time , as when recently we were told that no one over 40 should take exercise , or heart trouble would result . FRANK NORRIS .
