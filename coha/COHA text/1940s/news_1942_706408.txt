txt The British occupation of Madagascar means that the United Nations have at last seized the initiative in the war of bases . The greatest significance is attached here to the fact that ? the move was made with the full support of the United States and in the name of the United Nations as a whole . This is taken to mean that the Allied joint strategy , which has emerged from the recent visit of Gen. George C. Marshall , United States Chief of Staff , here , has been framed with a clear understanding of the vital importance which certain key bases hold in this world struggle . By forestalling the possible Japanese seizure of Madagascar , the United Nations have not only put themselves in a position to protect essential supply lines to the Middle East , India , and Australia . They have also revealed a practical grasp of the fact that in modern mobile warfare of land , sea , and air , victory goes to those who hold and make use of key bases . British Forces Land The landing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Courier Bay under the cover of warships and naval aircraft . A joint Admiralty and War I Office communique issued today announced that this force encoun tered little opposition and that it is now proceeding across the isthmus to the naval base at Diego Suarez . The communique expresses the hope that the French authorities will accept the offer of the United Nations to help in the de-sense of the island against Axis aggression . The naval force off the island is commanded by Rear Admiral E. N. Syf ret . The military force , commanded by Maj. Gen. R. G. Sturges , of the Royal Marines , is said to be mainly Commandos . No American or Free French troops or ships took part in the Madagascar operations . No South African forces were used either , the move being made entirely by the British Combined Operations Section . Action Up to Vichy Emphasis was placed both here and in Washington on the fact that the United Nations " have no intention of interfering with the French status of the territory , " and that it is up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a final diplomatic b4ak . The first impressions here , however , are that the Allied move Is the logical and correct answer to ' Pierre Laval 's return to power and that it will lead to a definite break . There have been frequent reports of Japanese negotiations // VICHY , France , May 5 ( 17 ) ? Chief of Government Pierre Laval declared tonight he had received a note from President Roosevelt demanding that France not defend Madagascar against British attack . and that the Vichy Government regarded this note as inadmissible . Nevertheless , France under no circumstances will make the first move toward a rupture with the United States , M. Laval said . Addressing a press conference , M. Laval declared in a husky voice : " The French Government leaves to President Roosevelt his part of the responsibility of the eventual consequences of this aggression . " By Joseph G. Harrison Staff Correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor WASHINGTON , May 5 ? British occupation of the Island of Madagascar and America 's blunt support of the move have aroused tremendous enthusiasm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coming as a great relief to both Army and Navy officials , this latest ' move is hailed as an important , strategical step to final victory . There is full expectation here that the United States will take a major part in converting the Island into the important Allied stronghold which it is expected to become in the shortest possible time . In fact , there is reason to believe that , while Britain will administer the Island , the United States will ' preliminary to the seizure of Madagascar , and it is now stated that two naval officers , ViceAdmiral Naokumi Nomura and Rear Admir4 Abe are in Vichy where they have had a number of talks lately with M. Laval and talks lately with M. Laval , Admiral Jean Darlan and Chief of State . Philippe Petain . The assumption is that they have wanted to make of Madagscar a second Indo-China , taking it over under the pretext of protecting it from the Allies and then using it as a key base for operations against them in the Indian Ocean and against Africa itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the headquarters of Gen. Charles de Gaulle here today the move is enthusiastically welcomed . In fact the Free French were among the first to perceive the danger of letting Madagascar fall into the hands of the Axis . So far as can be determined from the officail Admiralty and tiWar Office communique , 13ritish naval forces were not obliged to engage the French warships at Madagascar , which are believed to ! consist mainly of the cruisers Mont ! calm and Marseillaise , with a few destroyers . In the early stages of operations , the Commandos also ! appeared to have encountered little opposition . The French troops in Madagascar , under the command of a General Guillemet , are presumably located in the main near the big naval base of Diego Suarez , and the crucial test wil come when the British landing force , after crossing the narrow peninsula at the northern tip of the island , arrives at the naval base . The size of the British force Is not known , but it was described in authoritative circles here today as " adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , if Australia is excluded , nearly 1,000 miles long with nine ports and at least NO landing grounds for aircraft , it is clear that a sizeable torce will be needed in order to counter the possibility of an Axis attempt to take it by a combined sea and air attack at some later date . Now that the British are on the spot first , however , it is thought there is little likelihood of such an I attempt being made , at least until I the fate of Ceylon has been decided . U. S. Hails Allied Action In Taking Over Madagascar // equip and provision it from the rising flood of war material now being produced in this country . Great importance is attached here to that pact of the State Department 's announcement of the action which pr  --  ints out that " the Government of the United States is at war with the Axis powers and if it becomes necessary or desirable for American troops or ships to use Madagascar in the common cause . the United States will not hesitate to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic way of announc mg that the United States iias already decided Just what use it will make of Madagascar to ensure the final defeat of the Axis in Asia and North Africa . Equally significant , Washington believes , is the blunt American warning transmitted to the Theme Laval regime at Vichy that " any warlike act permitted by the French Government against the Government of Great Britain or the Government of the United States , would , of necessity , have to be regarded by the Government of the United States as an attack upon the United Nations as a whole . " This is interpreted as an unequivocal announcement that any action , such as the French aerial bombardment of Gibraltar following the unsuccessful British-Free French attack upon Dakar in 1940 , which Vichy may take against Britain because of Madagascar 's seizure will bring prompt and power ' ful military and naval retaliation by the United States . In other words . M. Laval now knows that the United States , like Great Britain , is ready to risk war with Vichy France at the first concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly Great Britain . German Threat Seen Although the State Department announcement stresses particularly Ithe danger of a Japanese attempt against Madagascar , official Washington is known to believe that the danger of a German attempt to dominate the Island , either ' di ! reetly or through the willing cora ; pliance of the pro-Nazi Laval re , gime , was equally great . In view of this strong Anglo-American apprehension over a ? possible German move against 1 Madagascar , there is re-aroused interest here in the question of ? Dakar , the highly important French West African port . The United States has made it clear that any indication of German use of or aspiration toward Dakar would be immediately met by concrete action en the part of this country . There is little doubt but what Dakar is looked upon here as important , if not more important than Madagascar and the latest Britisn move is believed to constitute a strong warning to Vichy regarding its West African port . Since the spread of the war to , the Indian Ocean , naval officers 1 here have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as to the other of the United Nations , of the Island of Madagascar . Ly ! ing 300 miles off the southeastern coast of Africa , its seizure by the ' Axis would sever American and British supply lines to the Middle East and to North Africa and would enable the Japanese to control both the eastern and the western approaches to the Indian Ocean . Used , with other Allied bases , however , it can become a bastion of anti-Axis strength . It is pointed nut that the United States is now building an Immense supply depot in the former Italian colony of Eritrea , while American equipment ? and technician. ; are pouring into the region from Libya to Iran Use of Madagascar as a way station and as a base for United Nation patrol planes and warships will net only provide added protection for this lifeline but will also accelerate delivery , it is held here .
