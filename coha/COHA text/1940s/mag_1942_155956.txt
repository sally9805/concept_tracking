Margaret was No. 3 . The neighbors heard her black Scottie howling incessantly , mournfully in the blackout . When police arrived , they found Margaret dead , with a stocking around her throat . Like the other two , she had been strangled and slashed with a knife or a razor . <P> " It 's ' im all right , " the police said to the neighbors . No one had heard anything except the dog 's howling . <P> London 's blackout is dismal everywhere , but around Piccadilly it was horrible , with that special horror which the British put so well into stage and movie chillers , sometimes into real life . The slow footsteps of streetwalkers patrolling the gloom gave way to silence . They had not been afraid of Nazi bombs , but they were afraid of this . <P> The new ripper 's first victim had tried to fight him off , was dragged into a street air-raid shelter and disposed of there . The police got his fingerprints from the skin of her neck , also from beer bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's handbag . When they made their arrest last week , four women had perished in five days , all strangled , all mutilated . <P> The man arrested was tall , handsome , pleasant-voiced Frederick George Cummings , 28 , an R.A.F. student pilot who had the reputation of being a brave , hard working and intelligent candidate for the Air Force , of being kind to his wife and child . The magistrate postponed the hearing until next month to let things quiet down , and handsome Frederick Cummings went to a cell . Once more , in the gloom around Piccadilly Circus , the streetwalkers took up their patrol .
