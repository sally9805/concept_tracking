When the Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. paid out $175,000 in fines early this year for violation of the antitrust laws , the company thought that its fight with the Government was ended . A. &; P. had been found guilty of using its mass buying power to get not only preferential prices but also the pick of the product from food producers . The Government had also made much of the fact that A. &; P. used the profits from its non-retail operations ( manufacturing &; processing ) to cut the prices in its retail stores , thus making it harder for other grocers to compete . But it pooh-poohed the more important point that lower retail prices are a boon to consumers . <P> Butcher Order . Last week the Department of Justice went after A. &; P. again , this time in a civil suit to break up the country 's biggest retail food company . As co-defendants it named nine subsidiary organizations , A. &; P. President John A. Hartford , 76 , and his brother , Board Chairman George L. Hartford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. &; P. stock , had paid fines of $10,000 apiece in the criminal case . DOJ wanted a court order to 1 ) divorce A. &; P. 's manufacturing and processing operations from its buying and selling organizations , and 2 ) carve up A. &; P. 's retail business ( 6,000 stores ) into seven separately owned retail food chains . <P> The purpose , explained Attorney General J. Howard McGrath in filing his first antitrust suit , was " to eliminate the abuse by A. &; P. of its mass buying and mass selling power . Such abuses in part have been responsible for an increase in gross sales by A. &; P. from $330 million in 1925 to $1.9 billion in 1947 , or 6.4% of the national total made by approximately 600,000 food stores . " With such statistics ( wh ! ch failed to mention that total U.S. grocery sales had also grown a great deal , while A. &; P. 's share of the business had dropped from 11.6% to 6.4% since 1933 ) , and with a repetition of the criminal charges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Quaint Way . " A. &; P. hit right back . It challenged DOJ 's " theory that the people have no right to patronize a company if their patronage will make that company grow . " By such " an attack on the entire system of efficient low-cost , low-profit mass distribution , " complained A. &; P. , the trustbusters were working " just opposite to the purpose of the antitrust laws , which were meant to increase competition and keep prices down . " <P> Actually , the suit was a complete reversal of the traditional bases for antitrust action , i.e. , that a company had a monopoly or restrained trade in order to keep prices high . Snapped A. &; P. : " The whole basis of this attack is the fact that we sold good food too cheap . " The New York Herald Tribune also found cause for alarm : " To start a major suit of this kind with no clear idea of the policy it serves or the economic results it is expected to achieve seems a quaint way of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOJ 's attack might well be higher food prices for consumers . Nevertheless , DOJ was confident of winning its case , since the charges against A. &; P. had been proved once before . If DOJ won again , it hinted it would follow up with similar suits against other large food chains .
