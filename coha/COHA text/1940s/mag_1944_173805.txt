The nation 's wartime birth rate is declining ( from a peak of 3.2 million in 1943 ) . The Census Bureau expects the birth rate to level off , for the remaining war years , at about 2.1 million annually . Peace will probably bring a temporary birth boom as war marriages begin producing and postponed marriages get under way ; then the birth rate is expected to slump again . The U.S. is faced with the prospect of a declining population within 50 years. * <P> <P> *For other news about the birth rate , see Medicine
