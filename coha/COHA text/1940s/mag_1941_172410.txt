What U.S. correspondents in Germany think of how the war is going-unlike the opinions of newsmen in Bern , Stockholm , Ankara and almost everywhere else-had until last week been little heard in the U.S. To find out , TIME 'S Stephen Laird got 18 U.S. newsmen in Berlin ( all except those of United Press and Chicago Daily News ' ) to answer a questionnaire telling , as they saw it , how things are going , how the war is likely to end . <P> On only three out of the 21 questions did the group reach or nearly reach unanimity : 1 ) they agreed that Turkey could not avoid signing with or fighting Germany ; 2 ) 16 believed that Turkey would sign within three months ; 3 ) they unanimously agreed that Russia was a self-seeking neutral . <P> On eight other questions the group reached a majority opinion . <P> &gt;Nine felt that Germany had suffered no appreciable military damage by bombing ( six felt it had , three said in effect " Not in Berlin , do n't know elsewhere " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defeated from the air ( one thought it could , two qualified ) . <P> &gt; Thirteen agreed that it would be impossible for anti-Axis forces to land and remain on the Continent ( three thought it would be possible , two qualified ) . <P> &gt; Eleven felt that Germany could not be defeated by economic strangulation ( six felt it could , one qualified ) . <P> &gt; Eleven saw no chance of revolution within Germany ( four saw some chance , three qualified ) . <P> &gt; Only eight thought that Germany eventually would declare war on the U.S. , but six others pointed out that Germany does n't bother to declare war . <P> &gt; Ten believed that U.S. fighting forces would be involved in the war ( four said no , four qualified ) . <P> &gt;Nine agreed that Germany would eventually fight Russia ( two said no , four qualified , three said nothing ) . <P> Questions on which no majority could be reached included whether Germany would invade England , whether Germany would succeed if it tried , whether success of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pact signifies . Asked how long the war would last , the correspondents gave answers varying from " peace negotiations before October " to " indefinite years " to " I pass-ca n't play in this poker game with a pair of threes . " <P> They split equally sharply as to the war 's outcome . Four said : " German military victory . " Two said : " God knows . " Other answers : " No winner . . . . Not a German victory . . . . German or Russian victory . . . . New order on German lines or chaos in Europe . . . . Winners : Russia and the United States . . . . Communistic controlled Europe and totalitarian Western Hemisphere . . . . Headaches , heartaches , bankruptcy and new but probably not better world . "
