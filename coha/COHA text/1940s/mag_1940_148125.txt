ARMY &; NAVY <P> High over droughty Kansas , one afternoon last week , a U. S. Army bomber flew into a dust storm . Lieut . Harold Neely eased his ship out of the sudden dusk and up to 11,000 feet , where the air was clear . Noting that the gasoline gauge was low , he turned on an auxiliary tank . Both motors spat , stopped . The plane nosed into a slow , singing glide . Pilot Neely peered down at the billowing , blinding sea of dust between him and the ground . Small indeed were his chances of landing safely . On the plane 's interphone he spoke an order to another lieutenant , a corporal and a private in a rear compartment : Jump ! <P> Lieut . Neely thought he saw one parachuted form , then another , dive away through the dust . He opened the canopy over his cockpit , prepared to follow . He paused : what of the third man , whom he had not seen ? If he for some reason had stayed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay , too , and fly the ship down . In the dusty dark , unbroken as he neared the ground , he had only his lighted instruments to tell him whether he was on an even keel , only his altimeter to tell him when he was close to the unpredictable earth . Harold Neely 's luck equaled his pluck . The bomber missed all the gullies , fences , poles , wires , barns , houses , livestock and civilians in that part of Kansas , glided into an open field . Damage : two bent propellers , a crumpled nose . Unhurt , Pilot Neely discovered that Lieut . John O. Neal and Private Henry Zielinski had parachuted safely down , three miles away . Unseen by Harold Neely , the fourth man in the ship jumped , fumbled with mittened hands at the rip cord of his chute , pulled it too late . On a barbed wire fence , 100 yards from the spot where the plane landed , farmers found the body of Corporal Kenneth Seamans.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
