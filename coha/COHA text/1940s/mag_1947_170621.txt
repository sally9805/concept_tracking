George Marshall 's pilgrimage to the Moscow Peace Conference was surrounded by episodes , signs &; portents , few of them cheerful . <P> The Lost Spring . Marshall 's first stop was Paris , where President Vincent Auriol gave a dinner in his honor at the Elyse Palace 's somber Salle Murat . On the guest of honor 's right sat Jeannette Vermeersch Thorez , longtime mistress and now wife of France 's Communist boss . The First Lady of French Communism speaks no English , and Marshall has forgotten most of his French ; so hardly a syllable passed between the table companions in the flickering candlelight , while Jeannette vigorously concentrated on her dinner ( Consomme Camelia , Timbale Joinville , Jambon d'York , Baltimore Laitue Nivernaise , Mousse Cyrano , Fromages , Fruits ) . Maurice Thorez himself was conspicuously absent . <P> In the salon next door , a saxophone quartet from the Garde Rpublicaine , reinforced by a violin and a harp , played throughout the meal ( sometimes with so much gusto that an attendant had to quiet them down ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the timbale by a new composition entitled Song of the Lost Spring . Just then , the springy weather outside gave way to a violent snowstorm , which remained over Paris until Marshall 's departure for Berlin next day . <P> The weather was just as bad in Germany . People fighting their way through unusually heavy snow cracked bitterly : " They 're even going to take spring away from us at Moscow . " In Berlin , Marshall urged conclusion of a 40-year Big Four Alliance to keep Germany disarmed , which , he said pointedly , should eliminate the suspicions with which some of the U.S. 's allies regard the U.S. 's role in Europe . But ever since Jimmy Byrnes first proposed this alliance last October , the Russians have ignored the offer . <P> " Better to Buy a Guitar . " In Moscow , though the sun was out when Marshall 's plane landed , things looked scarcely brighter . Andrei Vishinsky appeared , wear ing the steel grey Soviet diplomatic uniform with its star like a marshal 's . The U.S. Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reported one U.S. correspondent : " So in these strange times , a civilian dressed up like a general met a general dressed like a civilian . " <P> Into a waiting microphone , Marshall spoke a brief message : " This is my first real view of Russia and the Russian people , except for a brief period at remote Yalta . " His blue eyes twinkled at the word " remote , " as though it could be taken to mean not only Yalta 's distance in time &; space , but also the remoteness of Yalta 's mood of fatuous confidence . That afternoon , Ernie Bevin , 66 that day , dropped in on Molotov , who had turned 57 on the same day ; the double birthday party was not festive . <P> Next day , at his first Moscow press conference , Secretary Marshall was asked whether he would try to reform Soviet working habits ( Russian diplomats usually work till late into the night ) ; the Secretary grinned and said : " I have a great many important things to settle here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to . Besides , the Russians might object to your use of the word ' reform . ' "
