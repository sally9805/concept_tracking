What U.S. and British authorities had dreaded ever since Italy 's liberation-the organization of a Communist outbreak-was a fact last week . <P> Through the streets of Andria , in southern Italy , stalked Communist Leader Vincenzo di Gaetano , sporting a brace of pistols and a pair of huge knives . He had been sent to Andria by the Bari branch of the Communist Party . Round his neck on a string was a whistle , with which in recent weeks he has frequently summoned from their labor in the fields the 600 men and 500 women of his rowdy revolutionary " armed escort . " <P> Armed with hand grenades and machine guns , Andria 's Communists had disarmed the local carabinieri , looted a train carrying food , confiscated cattle from the farmers , replaced Andria 's liberal mayor with a Communist laborer , evicted the Socialist leader of the local labor federation from his office , opened the jail and enrolled the inmates in the Communist ranks , kidnapped persons whose fate is a mystery , liquidated the family of the local forester who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two were killed . Comrade di Gaetano telephoned to demand that the others be withdrawn at once , that ten local carabinieri be put at his disposal . Meanwhile the unrest spread to nearby Corato , Trani , Barletta and Canosa di Puglia . <P> To Rome went appeals for help . Premier Ferruccio Parri , who as Minister of the Interior heads the police , sent down Socialist Minister Gaetano Barbareschi with orders to " appease the Andrian autonomists . " While he addressed the Andrian Socialists , the Communists set fire to the local courthouse . Then Communist Minister of Finance Mauro Scoccimarro was sent to Andria . The situation grew calmer , but the Communists refused to surrender their arms . Police knew that the Communists had turned the local caves into arsenals , but the arms were not confiscated and no arrests were made . <P> The Andria outbreak divided Premier Parri 's new coalition Government . Left-wingers insisted that the riots were due entirely to the serf-like conditions of the Bari farm laborers . Liberals and Christian Democrats agreed that conditions were bad , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said , Andria 's Communists must obey the law . While they argued , Vincenzo di Gaetano continued to rule Andria.
