Father of all precision tools is the Johansson gauge block , invention of a Swedish genius , now made in the U.S. exclusively by Ford . With surfaces finished to an accuracy ( at a constant temperature of 68 F. ) within two-millionths of an inch , these blocks maintain the accuracy of micrometers and other gauges down to a ten-thousandth of an inch , thus make possible the interchangeability of parts , essence of mass production . Today , with production booming , the " Jo " blocks , always scarce , are spread as thin as management itself . Last week a lone machinist in a privy-sized Cleveland shop was easing the scarcity and making a lot of money at it . <P> Carl Edward Johansson , working in a Swedish arsenal , cracked the accurate-measurement nut in the 1890s . He knew there was nothing so accurate in the hands of a toolmaker as a simple block of steel . Assuming that the average shop needed measurements for every ten-thousandth of an inch from 1/10 of an inch to 12 inches , a complete set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he found that every one of these measurements could be obtained by a combination of only 81 pieces , the smallest being 1/10 of an inch , the largest four inches . <P> For example : a tool manufacturer requires a measurement of 3.3755 inches . This can be made up with four pieces : 3.000 , .150 , .125 , .1005 ) one on top of the other . <P> By study of steel 's molecular characteristics , of the effects of temperature on it , and by secret methods of lapping steel by hand , Johansson created blocks so near to absolute flatness that the error was less than four-millionths of an inch . In 1923 , when Jo blocks were standard throughout the machine world , Johansson came to the U.S. , hooked up with Henry Ford who set him up in the Ford Motor Co . <P> Among the thousands of mechanics who learned the importance of Jo blocks in World War I was a Cleveland lad named George D. Webber . In his shop only the boss had a Jo set-they cost around $1,500 then-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the use of it in time to check his work . He decided he could make a million dollars by cracking old Johansson 's secret . Later he decided he could make accurate gauges by machine . <P> By 1929 Webber had set up his first machine in a bedroom . The first blocks came out a mess , but he finally made some with an error of only eight-millionths of an inch . He cut the error down , began to sell some sets , until depression killed his market . In 1932 , his mama let him build a shop in her backyard . Soon he began to peddle his wares again , doubled his sales every year . This year he expects to sell 2,000 sets , all finished by one machine .
