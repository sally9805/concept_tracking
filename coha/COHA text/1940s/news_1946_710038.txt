txt New York was chosen late last night as the permanent world capital of the United Nations by a vote of 46 to 7 . With unusual speed and almost no speeches , the General Assembly agreed by a huge majority that the permanent headquarters should be established in midtown Manhattan on the six-block tract offered as a $8,500,000 gift by John D. Rockefeller Jr . In dramatic circumstances , after Dr. Eduardo Zuleta Angel of Colomt chairman of the Headquarters Committee , had left his hospital bed to appeal to the delegates to accept the philanthropist 's offer , the representatives showed their enthusiasm for the proposed world capital by registering their votes with unusually -- audible voices . If there was any sour note in the almost unanimous approval , it was in the negative tallies recorded by the pan-Arab States , although Dr. Zulu ? a made a particular plea to the delegates of these countries to forget their " prejudices " against New York and join the majority in a strong show of gratitude. to Mr. Rockefeller . Leaves Hospital Bed to Vote The vote was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after following its adjournment for dinner , with Warren R. Austin , chief United States delegate , walking up to the dais to ask the delegates to consider the site question out of turn in deference to Dr. Zuleta , who was so anxious to be present for the official roll call that he had come to the Assembly chamber straight from the hospital . Dr. Zuleta then walked slowly Plea Made to Arab Members Dr. Zuleta pleaded almost fervently with the Arab League members , referring inferentially to the Arab objections to the large Jewish population in New York . He said he was addressing the Arab delegates cordially , from the rostrum , and begging them to forget their prejudices . Dr. Zuleta also tried to persuade the Australian delegation to drop its support of San Francisco and rally behind the New York supporters . He failed in both cases , however , although one of the strongest champions of San Francisco in the past , India , evoked warm applause when I. N. Sapru stood up and declared that as long as the majority was going to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope we shall learn to love New York and that New York will learn to love us , " he said . " We hope to see more of New York , and we hope New York will be seeing much more of us in the years to come . " Norman J. 0 . Makin of Australia took the floor for a moment and joined in the sentiments of appreciation to Mr. Rockefeller for his gift . But he declared that Australia still thought San Francisco was the best choice in the country as a world capital and that San Francisco was going to get Australia 's vote no matter how the rest of the Assembly voted . Dr. Abdel Hakim el Rifai Bey of Egypt declared the " Egyptian delegation has no prejudice against New York , but we shall vote against New York as a permanent hesadquarters . " A supplementary resolution entrusting to the Secretary General the task of negotiating with United States authorities concerning legal arrangements associated with the permanent headquarters site was adopted , with one abstention , Egypt . Secretary General Trygve Lie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural plans for the skyscraper Specialists and technicians , including eminent architects from many of the member nations , may be called into advisory sessions with Mr. Lie to plan the international Parliament buildings that are to go up in the abattoir district of the East Side . There will probably still be many headaches as far as the " site question " is concerned during the next three to five years and more of design , demolition , excavation and construction , and international controversies bred by conflicts in artistic ideas may be expected until the future " Parliament houses of the world " are completed . The subject of a permanent headquarters started out more than twelve months ago to be one of the supposedly simple problems Facing the new-born organization , but it developed quickly and unexpectedly into a confused snarl that almost " miraculously " was unraveled only in the past ninety pours , at precisely the time when the site difficulties seemed insoluble , at least during this session . Nine or ten different bodies of the United Nations , including an uncounted number of sub-groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliberated on the subject . The Assembly itself has discussed the problem in three separate plenary debates ; three specially authorized site inspection groups have to'ether traveled by plane , ship , train and afoot probably a distance of , 20,000 miles , personally to survey something like 155 square miles of Land , and have spent a total of $368,000 ? perhaps more  --  to reach a decision . Yet , ironically enough , the site that has finally been chosen by the United Nations is one that has cost the international organization exactly nothing to survey , study , approve and accept . Moreover , it took the United Nations fewer . than four days from the first moment it heard about the East River site until the Assembly voted to move in . Much of this , of course , is owing to an amazing combination of circumstances and to the prestige of Mr. Rockefeller . Through all the long site search in San Francisco , 1 Boston , Philadelphia and New ' York , it was never any secret that the United Nations delegates were g'enerally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent world capital .

One aspect of the site discussions is whether the Assembly will hold its next session in Geneva , as has been suggested in a proposal submitted by the Ukrainian delegation , but it was reported last column missing where the different peoples of the world are " molded " in a common society . The chairman asked the delegates to think what factors like these would mean " materially and morally " to an organization like the United Nations . Anticipating criticisms of the East Side 's slum atmosphere and the proximity of other buildings to the future vertical capital of the United Nations , Dr. Zuleta declared that the " skyscrapers and chimneys " of Manhattan would not hinder the work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as it is in every practical aspect .
