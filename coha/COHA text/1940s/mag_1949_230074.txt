<P> Some of his fellow Communists , said Poland 's President Boleslaw Bierut , had been " politically blind . " What they had not seen was the Red handwriting on the wall : Stalin had slated Poland for all-out economic and military colonization . A purge of the blind was inevitable . <P> Last week Wladyslaw Gomulka , once the country 's No. 1 Communist but for some time past under suspicion of being a Titoist , was expelled from the Communist Party Central Committee . Vice Minister of Justice Zenon Kliszko and Minister of Construction Spychalski were also kicked out . All were denounced as " masked enemies , provocateurs , saboteurs and traitors " -a few of the epithets currently applied to Titoists by true-blue Stalinists . Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky , new Soviet proconsul for Poland ( TIME , Nov. 21 ) , was elected to the purified Central Committee . <P> Next day , Premier Jozef Cyrankiewicz , turncoat Socialist who last year engineered his party 's merger with the Communists , hastily put in his two zlotys ' worth . He announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " hypocrite . " <P> Meanwhile , a rash of " sabotage " trials had broken out in Poland . The head of the state farms in Qlsztyn was sentenced to be hanged for " deliberately failing to carry out the state plan . " In Lodz , five state bank directors were sent to prison for " mismanagement of state finances . " So much administrative talent had been axed that President Bierut found it necessary to instruct party officials to avoid " all hasty and imprudent dismissals . . . "
