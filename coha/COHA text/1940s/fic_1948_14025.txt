The curtain rises in darkness . Then a single spotlight comes up to show , sitting at stage right , a young woman dressed in a gray fur-trimmed costume of a fashion usual at the time of Henry VIII . There are dark hangings behind her , broken only by a small , barred window which the lights project on one panel of the curtains . The young woman is Anne Boleyn , and the time is the evening of May 18 , 1530 ANNE BOLEYN If I were to die now  --  but I must not die yet , not yet . It 's been too brief . A few weeks and days . How many days , I wonder , since the first time I gave myself , to that last day when he  --  when he left me at the lists and I saw him no more ? Well , I can reckon it . I have time enough .

" A king , " I said , " a king , and can not reckon . " I was his clever girl then , his Nan ; he 'd kiss me then , and maul me , and take me down . On the rushes . Anywhere . Why do I think of it now ? Would he kill me ? Kill me ? She laughs p. 3 Henry ? The fool ? That great fool kill me ? God knows I deserve it . God knows I tried to kill , and it may be I succeeded . I did succeed . I know too well I succeeded , and I 'm guilty , for I brought men to death unjustly , as this death of mine will be unjust if it comes  --  only I taught them the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be. . No , but Henry . He could not . Could not. Could I kill him , I wonder ? I feel it in my hands perhaps I could . So  --  perhaps he could kill me . Perhaps he could kill me . If it came tomorrow , how many days would it have been , She makes a mark on the tabletbeginning with our first day ? The lights dim down and go out except on Anne 's face . She remains visible in reverie during the first few moments of the first scene@@ The lights come up on a circle at stage left . A great window , partly of stained glass , is projected on the curtain background , and Mary Boleyn ( she is the wife of William Carey , but that hardly counts for she has been the mistress of King Henry for four years , and she is only twenty-three ) stands , peering through one of the panes . We are in the castle at Hever , owned by Thomas Boleyn , the king 's treasurer , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOLEYN enters from stage right . THOMAS BOLEYN Mary ? MARY BOLEYN Yes , father . THOMAS BOLEYN You watch for someone ? MARY BOLEYN I thought I saw the king on the road below . THOMAS BOLEYN We were to talk over the enclosure of a hunting park near Haver . MARY BOLEYN He 's here to see you , then ? THOMAS BOLEYN I think so , child . MARY BOLEYN Not me ? THOMAS BOLEYN Not this time . MARY BOLEYN But I may speak to him in passing , surely ? THOMAS BOLEYN Perhaps  --  but  --  He pauses in embarrassmentI wonder if you could do this ? Could you go to your room while he 's here  --  and not see him  --  and send no message ? p. 5 MARY BOLEYN Why ? THOMAS BOLEYN Could you do this ? MARY BOLEYN Go to my room ! But for what reason ? I have some rights in this house I should think  --  as your daughter , if not as the wife of my husband . And in the kingdom as the king 's mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which you have encouraged me to be ! THOMAS BOLEYN Did you need encouraging , Mary ? Think back on the fever you were in those days . Did you need encouragement ? MARY BOLEYN If I am sent out of the way I shall ask the king why . THOMAS BOLEYN Very well . MARY BOLEYN And now . I shall ask him now ! THOMAS BOLEYN The truth is , the king sent ahead to make sure we two could speak alone , He and I. MARY BOLEYN He asked  --  not to see me ? THOMAS BOLEYN Not in so many words  --  but  --  MARY BOLEYN That could mean  --  I was not to see him again . THOMAS BOLEYN One never gets used to these things  --  there 's always a hell to go through . But when a girl gives herself so completely  --  p. 6 MARY BOLEYN You knew when I gave myself !

THOMAS BOLEYN Mary , girl , I 've always loved you . I would n't want to hurt you in any way . And all these things are true . The king has been generous to me because you were generous to him  --  and I know that and I 've known it all the time . But could I have refused what he gave ? I 've been grateful to you , Mary  --  and ashamed of having to be grateful  --  yet I could n't refuse what was offered . And now  --  if you 've lost the king , I do n't know how to help with that . I shall help any other way I can. . You still have your husband . MARY BOLEYN Who wants my husband ?

The newcomer is Cardinal Wolsey p. 7 CARDINAL WOLSEY You 've told her ? THOMAS BOLEYN Yes . CARDINAL WOLSEY And Anne ? THOMAS BOLEYN The earl is with her . CARDINAL WOLSEY The king rode close behind me , Thomas . THOMAS BOLEYN My dear Cardinal , I have encouraged Anne with the young noble . He 'll have the greatest estates in the north of England . It was something off my mind that Anne should like him and want him , for she 's not easy to please . It never entered my head that the king had noticed her . What can I say to her now ? CARDINAL WOLSEY To send the earl away . THOMAS BOLEYN I think they have a sort of engagement between them . CARDINAL WOLSEY Well  --  the king 's here . THOMAS BOLEYN I think it would need more time . CARDINAL WOLSEY Suppose you take the king to look at your hounds . Tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some trouble with it  --  her hands tremble over the fastenings , and other rubbish of that sort . I 'll speak to Anne and to the earl . THOMAS BOLEYN Well  --  if you 'll manage it . A SERVANT enters p. 8 SERVANT My lord  --  HENRY VIII enters behind the servant . A rough , shrewd , merry , brutal man in the thirties , accustomed to making himself at home in this house and with all his subjects when he thinks the effect might be good . NORRIS and SMEATON enter after him HENRY VIII To Norris and SmeatonWait for me , gentlemen . Only your king , Thomas . No ceremony . Only your Henry . Nevertheless he gives his hand to be kissed and BOLEYN kisses it . NORRIS and SMEATON go outAnd how 's the vicar of hell this chilly spring morning ? The SERVANT goes out CARDINAL WOLSEY I keep warm , Majesty . HENRY VIII I 'm sure you do . With your feet on the devil 's fender . Meanwhile toasting your paddocks at God 's altar . CARDINAL WOLSEY And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . HENRY VIII Has he done my errand ? THOMAS BOLEYN Yes , he has . HENRY VIII May I smell this pretty posy of yours ? THOMAS BOLEYN My lord , if you mean Anne , she 's still at her mirror , and  --  if you could give her a half hour . p. 9 HENRY VIII We 've this whole day . THOMAS BOLEYN There was a clump of red deer grazing within view when I last looked out . In velvet , but they give promise of sport later . HENRY VIII We 'll see them . We 'll see your red deer , and afterward we 'll appraise what was seen in that same looking glass . He turns CARDINAL WOLSEY Good hunting , Majesty . HENRY VIII You wo n't be with us ? CARDINAL WOLSEY It happens there is a poor soul in the house who seeks the ministrations of a religious . I must go where I am called . HENRY VIII You will go wherever it 's most profitable for the Cardinal of York to be at any given time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin excuses . CARDINAL WOLSEY Yes , Majesty . He goes out HENRY VIII There 's no hurry about the deer . I want three words with you . THOMAS BOLEYN Yes ? HENRY VIII There 's always a temptation , when a man 's in my position , that he 'll think of the nation as his own trough , and get all four feet in it and eat from one end to the other . I do n't want to look like that to anybody . p. 10 THOMAS BOLEYN You do n't , my sovereign . HENRY VIII I 'm a religious man , Boleyn . I want to do what 's right in the eyes of God and the church . And myself  --  and my people  --  and you . THOMAS BOLEYN That 's a swath of folk to satisfy  --  if you include God . HENRY VIII I include both God and the women  --  among them your daughters . What will your daughters say of me  --  the two of them together  --  talking at night ? THOMAS BOLEYN What two women say together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both  --  and taken both . No man will ever know that . But I think  --  if you do n't mind  --  HENRY VIII I 've asked you . THOMAS BOLEYN I think you go a little rapid with Annie . You 'll need to be gentle . HENRY VIII But she 'll have me  --  in the end ? THOMAS BOLEYN She 's no fool , my lord . HENRY VIII After a pauseWhat I do is God 's will . THOMAS BOLEYN Now , if a man or a monarch could be sure of that ! HENRY VIII I 've worked it out , in my mind  --  I pray to God . He hesitatesI tell you this first , Boleyn . God answers prayer . That 's known . Every morning I go on my knees and pray that what I do may be God 's will . I pray him to direct me  --  that whatever thought comes to my mind  --  whatever motion floods in my heart  --  shall be God 's will  --  and I only His instrument . Wherever I turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thread my way among the crossed paths of the law , or interpret the holy word , or judge men innocent  --  or guilty  --  every morning I pray Him on my knees nothing shall rise in my brain or heart but He has wished it first . And since He answers prayer , and since He 's given me such heavy power to act , power for good and evil , He must answer this . He does answer . I find such peace in this , that not one morning my whole life long shall I fail these devotions. p. 11 THOMAS BOLEYN This is a noble thought , of course , but Your Majesty realizes that it might be used as an excuse for  --  HENRY VIII For what ? THOMAS BOLEYN For doing as you please . HENRY VIII I 'm quite serious , Boleyn . I want no trifling . THOMAS BOLEYN It was not my intention to trifle . HENRY VIII But you do ! I tell you I pray and God answers ! THOMAS BOLEYN Yes , my lord . HENRY VIII I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am younger than many dukes and earls and peers . But I am the king of England . When I pray God answers . I will not have this questioned . THOMAS BOLEYN Yes , my lord . NORRIS and SMEATON enter HENRY NORRIS We 're sent as a delegation , my lord . HENRY VIII Come in , come in . Pour it on , whatever it is . Your king is your natural receptacle for whatever you ca n't hold any longer . HENRY NORRIS The fact is we are sent to keep you amused while Sir Thomas Boleyn confers with his lady wife . There is a sort of kitchen rebellion afoot and his voice is needed . p. 12 HENRY VIII Go , Boleyn , mollify your women . THOMAS BOLEYN If you 'll excuse me . He goes HENRY VIII Come in , lads . I want a word with you , anyway  --  man to man , kingship aside .

MARK SMEATON A maid , Your Majesty ? HENRY VIII I would n't swear to that . Not medically . But a young one  --  a bit wild  --  uncaught . HENRY NORRIS I could n't say of my own knowledge , sir , but Tom Wyatt has an unfailing way . He writes them poems . MARK SMEATON But you ca n't catch a ticklish hoyden with madrigals . That 's for matrons . HENRY VIII Then your lure , Smeaton ? Your favorite ? MARK SMEATON My king , my acquaintance does n't run among the grade of females you seek . I 'm more successful with waiting women and ladies ' maids . HENRY VIII Do n't be modest , lad . I 've followed your spoor so close there was scarce time to close the window you left by  --  or change perfumes to put me off the scent  --  p. 13 MARK SMEATON Truly , truly  --  HENRY VIII I 've breathed your same air in some close quarters , singer . So speak on . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a singer , I sing to them a good deal  --  but , in addition to that  --  you will not be offended ? HENRY VIII I 'll be offended if you keep back , musician . Be ashamed of nothing . We live in a new age , a new time . I was born within a year of the discovery of the new world . We revise all the old laws to suit ourselves . And the mysteries and manners . MARK SMEATON Why , then , if you truly want her , make her believe you 're potent only with her , Majesty , and that will do the business . Make out that you 've tried with numbers of others , gone to bed and kissed hotly , and hung embarrassed and unable . But with her you rouse up . You 're a man again . They ca n't resist that . They open like  --  HENRY VIII Never mind the simile . There 's nothing like it . But , lad , this is new , this device . MARK SMEATON I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entersWe 're speaking of the best way to woo a green maid , Norfolk . You 're a man of expedients . You know these things  --  if you have n't forgotten them . p. 14 DUKE OF NORFOLK Why , my advice is , if you want a woman , take her . HENRY VIII There are certain preliminaries . There 's consent , anyway . You must have consent . DUKE OF NORFOLK Nonsense . Take her and make her like it . Why should a woman have anything to say about it ? HENRY VIII It may have been so in the good old days . Today we woo  --  and wait . HENRY NORRIS Do you wish her to be in love with you , my lord ? HENRY VIII That I do . HENRY NORRIS Do you wish to be in love with her ? HENRY VIII In love with her ? I ? Personally ? Now , I 'll tell you the truth , so far my experience of being in love is like this : love is a kind of wanting , a panting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lass , anyway ? To be assuaged .

MARK SMEATON Have you ever been refused by a maid ? HENRY VIII Refused ? I ? No , I think not . When I 've wanted them I 've had them . And once I 've had a wench , I 'm cured . That 's general , is n't it ? Broad and narrow ? p. 15 HENRY NORRIS My king , with me it 's the opposite . Once I 've mixed flesh and lips with her I 'm in danger of a golden wedding  --  should we both live . HENRY VIII It can happen so ? MARK SMEATON The poor gudgeon 's hooked now . He 'll never swim free again . HENRY NORRIS And she wo n't look at me . HENRY VIII Keep me from that , good God ! DUKE OF NORFOLK Can you youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venison ? HENRY VIII Yes  --  come . Next to the haunch of a virgin there 's nothing like a haunch of venison . The lights go out on the scene p. 16 Act 1 , Scene 2 Act One : SCENE 2 The lights go up on a circle at stage left , where Anne Boleyn and Percy , Earl of Northumberland , sit on a bench , their arms about each other . Anne is younger than in the Prologue , and dressed in a simple morning dress of the period . Percy is a young , headstrong , handsome fellow , not without brains and spirit . A half-open casement takes shape on the curtains at the rear . ANNE BOLEYN I 'm angry with myself about one thing . LORD PERCY Yes , dear . ANNE BOLEYN I spent two years at the court of Queen Claude . I met there the silkened flower of the aristocracy . Such manners , such grace , such horsemanship and dancing ! They spoke Greek , they spoke Latin , they spoke Italian  --  and they spoke their own French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a new glimpse of what a language could be ! LORD PERCY But what disappointed you ? ANNE BOLEYN Among them there were  --  well , truly gallant men . Captivating men . Charmers . With an ease of carriage  --  and a way with women that. and I fell in love with none of them . I came home and promptly fell in love with a  --  a thistle . A countryman from the north . With no graces at all . Ca n't dance . Ca n't sing . Can hardly speak English . p. 17 LORD PERCY Can put his arm around you . ANNE BOLEYN Does n't do that well . Not as well as I 've known it done . But it 's the one arm I want  --  for some God-knows-what reason . You do everything badly  --  everything awkwardly  --  and I love it the way you do it . LORD PERCY I 'm glad I was n't educated in France . ANNE BOLEYN Why ? LORD PERCY You would n't have loved me . ANNE BOLEYN I wonder . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homespun wears through the years . ANNE BOLEYN One thing though . If we love enough to marry we must love enough to keep nothing back . I shall keep nothing from you . LORD PERCY Nor I from you , sweet . ANNE BOLEYN But you have . You do n't know what I mean . LORD PERCY Are we to lie together ? Before ? ANNE BOLEYN If you like . But that 's not it . LORD PERCY My bonny , what more can there be than that ? ANNE BOLEYN Kiss me hard . He kisses her p. 18 LORD PERCY I wish I had you in my house . ANNE BOLEYN MusingThat 's part of it , too . To be Lady Anne , and live with you in your house , and sleep with you at night , and in the morning  --  well , the servants will bring in breakfast to the earl  --  to Percy , the Earl of Northumberland , and his wife . LORD PERCY Will you like that ? ANNE BOLEYN Yes . It 's far from the court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way off . But it 's power , and I love you , and I 'll like it . Tell me , are you a virgin ? LORD PERCY I ? ANNE BOLEYN Yes , Earl of Northumberland  --  you . LORD PERCY I 'm a man . ANNE BOLEYN I know . But are you a virgin ? When we bed together shall I be your first ? LORD PERCY I  --  ANNE BOLEYN Do n't be confused , dear . Folk are such barbarians here in England ! Say it out as it was . For me , I 'll say it all frankly , the way they do in France . In England we make muddy mysteries of such things . As if they were crimes  --  but they 've happened to all of us . We do n't come out of a rainbow at seventeen and there 's no use pretending we did . You may ask me whatever you like . A pause p. 19 LORD PERCY Are you a virgin ? ANNE BOLEYN No . They look away from each other LORD PERCY Was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But long before France , too . When I was little I was playing with a boy in the woods near Hever , not far from here . We quarreled about something , and he threw me down and  --  She risesGod help me , I 'm blushing . All over . I thought I 'd finished with that . But no  --  it began at my heels  --  I could feel it  --  and rushed up in a wave till now it burns at the roots of my hair . And I 've told this before  --  LORD PERCY Without blushing ? ANNE BOLEYN DefiantlyYes ! But there 's something in the foggy , torpid air of this island that makes people want to hide things . Like savages . LORD PERCY There might be another reason . ANNE BOLEYN What ? LORD PERCY Look at me . She does soWere you ever in love before ? ANNE BOLEYN I think  --  no . No . LORD PERCY Now I 'm no spring of wisdom in these matters , Anne , but it may be you 're not a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've nothing to hide till then . p. 20 ANNE BOLEYN SlowlyYes . It may be . It may be that you 're wiser than you think . LORD PERCY I hope so . A man has to be wiser than he thinks or he wo n't go far . ANNE BOLEYN It 's strange . I stand here still trying to say it to you  --  and it 's a perfectly natural thing  --  and my tongue wo n't say it . LORD PERCY Never mind . I do n't want to hear it . ANNE BOLEYN You are a Boeotian , are n't you , darling ? You 're horribly embarrassed . But you should n't be , and I should n't . I wo n't take up with these shamefaced country manners  --  LORD PERCY I do n't want to hear it . I 'm afraid I do n't like this game you learned in Paris . ANNE BOLEYN Were you an angel , darling ? LORD PERCY No . I was not . ANNE BOLEYN Tell me about the girls . How many and when . LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet . I 'll be the man of the house when we have a house , and if any game 's to be played I 'll lead in that game and not follow . I do n't want to sear my tongue or redden my forehead with this kind of thing . The game I like now is to put my arms about you and say nothing . p. 21 ANNE BOLEYN You know , I think I like that better , too . Come , then . PERCY takes Anne in his arms again . At the same moment a shadow moves toward them from the center of the stage , and ANNE puts up a hand to hold Percy 's lips from hersI think the Cardinal is here . She rises . Percy keeps his seat and holds her hand . WOLSEY steps toward them into the light . PERCY rises CARDINAL WOLSEY I 'm glad I find you together , for I have to speak to you both . I 'm sorry to find you so intimate , for it 's about that I have to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given some thought to where you shall marry , and an alliance with the Talbots , through one of the daughters of the Earl of Shrewsbury , is thought best . LORD PERCY An  --  alliance with  --  ! Not by me , my lord Cardinal . CARDINAL WOLSEY Anne , my dear , your father has a claim on the Ormond estates in Ireland . He and the king have agreed that you will marry the Earl of Ormond to reinforce that claim . ANNE BOLEYN I  --  marry into Ireland ? CARDINAL WOLSEY It 's so decided . ANNE BOLEYN But how can you  --  ? It 's not so decided ! Not one word of this has been said to me ! Of Ormond or Ireland  --  ! p. 22 CARDINAL WOLSEY Your father will deal with you . As for Lord Percy , remember , if you will , that I brought you to court and that you are still a member of my household . A half-grown steer and a leggy girl will not be allowed to overturn the policies of England , fixed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am of full age , and I have pledged myself to this girl before many witnesses  --  among them her own father ! It 's a good match for both of us , and nothing 's been said against it till this moment ! More than that , we 've pledged ourselves to each other , and our hearts go with that pledge ! CARDINAL WOLSEY No doubt . And this is the reward I get for my kindness to you . He turns away ANNE BOLEYN SoftlyMy lord Cardinal , that we two are in love , and have been these two months , every servant in the house knows , for we 've made no secret of it before them or anyone . That we are in love , that we mean to marry , has been no secret from the whole world all that time . Why you 've come here now to tell us suddenly that we 're to match elsewhere , we do n't know . There must be some reason behind it . Tell us what it is . CARDINAL WOLSEY I have told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't listen ! p. 23 LORD PERCY Nor I ! CARDINAL WOLSEY I stand here as the king 's minister , and you 're aware of that . I knew a great lord to die for less than you have just said . His name was Buckingham . LORD PERCY More humblyYou know I have no wish to anger the king . But tell us what this means and why you say it to us . CARDINAL WOLSEY ThunderingDo you think the king and I come lightly to such decisions as this ? Do you think we have not weighed every reason for and against before we issue a command ? One thing I can tell you , you will obey or your estates are forfeit ! If you continue disloyal it 's doubtful how long you will live ! Go now , for I wish to speak to Anne alone . LORD PERCY Anne  --  ANNE BOLEYN Yes , you must go . LORD PERCY Kiss me then . CARDINAL WOLSEY Do not touch her . LORD PERCY All this talk of sudden death makes it very easy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I like . And he does so ANNE BOLEYN Only take care of yourself . I shall see you . p. 24 LORD PERCY Yes . He turns and goes stage right , into darkness . Anne stands silent and defiant , looking at Wolsey CARDINAL WOLSEY Look your knives through and through me , mistress . At my age it will do me no hurt  --  and at yours , though you hurt easily , you will cure quickly . Are you serious about this thorn apple from the north ? ANNE BOLEYN My lord  --  he 's mine  --  and I 'm his . CARDINAL WOLSEY But if there were another and worthier , well , you could change ? ANNE BOLEYN No . CARDINAL WOLSEY But I think when you see him you will . ANNE BOLEYN The Lord of Ormond ? Hardly . CARDINAL WOLSEY That was only a name plucked out of the air . I had another in mind . ANNE BOLEYN I want no other . And if you do him harm  --  this my chosen husband  --  I am only a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARDINAL WOLSEY Look down at your necklace , Anne . Do you see a writing on it ? ANNE BOLEYN There 's no writing on it . CARDINAL WOLSEY There is , though , and I can see it , though it may not be visible to you as yet . The writing is a quotation from a poem . It says : " Noli me tangere , for Caesar 's I am . " You have studied Latin ? p. 25 ANNE BOLEYN Yes . CARDINAL WOLSEY " Touch me not , " the translation might go , " I belong to the king . " ANNE BOLEYN What king ? CARDINAL WOLSEY We have only one king in England . ANNE BOLEYN I want no king . I want only the person of my choice . CARDINAL WOLSEY When Harry of England turns his eyes on a girl she can hardly look away . ANNE BOLEYN After a pauseForgive me if I seem slow to understand what you say . Do you mean that King Henry has looked at me ? CARDINAL WOLSEY Yes . ANNE BOLEYN And sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to anticipate his desires . Two figures come toward them out of shadow from stage right ANNE BOLEYN Perhaps you would be wise to anticipate the answer he will receive from me if he comes . We have had him in the bosom of our family for some years . My sister is probably with child by him at the moment . And of no further use to him . I shall not go the way of my sister , thank you  --  THOMAS BOLEYN and his wife , ELIZABETH , come forward out of the shadow p. 26 THOMAS BOLEYN Anne ! ANNE BOLEYN Do you also offer me up to this royal bull  --  you , my father ? And you , my mother ? THOMAS BOLEYN Hush , daughter ! Manage your voice . He 's in the house . There is a silence ANNE BOLEYN Why is he here ? THOMAS BOLEYN To see you . ANNE BOLEYN Well  --  you 've let him come  --  I have n't . Find some way out of it . THOMAS BOLEYN It 's not my doing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And since that is what every girl in England prays for , how was I to know it would displease you ? ANNE BOLEYN Do you know what it is to be in love ? Either of you ? Do you remember ? Remember what it 's like to have your whole life follow one person out at the door  --  and not to live again , and not want to live , till he returns ? THOMAS BOLEYN You have been in France  --  and at the court . ANNE BOLEYN I 've been many places , and done more things than you know  --  yet there 's only one man I want now ! And I 'll have no one else ! No one ! Mother ! ELIZABETH BOLEYN SoftlyYes  --  I said these things once  --  all of them  --  and I would help you now if I could . But I know now that we 're not free to have or take or choose .

And we 're not safe now ! If you think we 're safe , or that you are , or that we 'll ever be safe , or that you will , you 're more of a fool than any daughter of mine has a right to be ! ELIZABETH BOLEYN Do you know what it means when a king asks for you ? Do you know what goes with it ? ANNE BOLEYN Yes  --  I know that . I know , all too exactly . CARDINAL WOLSEY If he feels a coldness in you he 'll not want you , I can assure you of that . Indicate only a slight doubt  --  and the king will be gone . He is not accustomed to hesitations . ELIZABETH BOLEYN And do you know what it means when a king asks for you and you turn him away ? We can say farewell to all we 've worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favor . ANNE BOLEYN Then say good-by to all that  --  all of you  --  this whole family and house  --  for I wo n't have the king ! I do n't want him and I wo n't have him ! THOMAS BOLEYN As for this boy you 've set your heart on  --  this Northumberland  --  do n't count on him beyond the castle gate . Would he dare touch a girl the king had bid for ? CARDINAL WOLSEY Would he dare marry into a family which had displeased his sovereign ? p. 28 ANNE BOLEYN He would dare anything ! CARDINAL WOLSEY He will not dare either of these . ANNE BOLEYN My lord Cardinal , we are only one family among many at court  --  and in this family only two sisters , Mary and I. Surely one of two sisters should be enough . Surely he could look elsewhere now . CARDINAL WOLSEY There are only two things to blame  --  the king 's will , and your own self , your form and face and words . The king has seen you and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I ca n't change him . ELIZABETH BOLEYN He is our king , Anne . He is a great king . He is young and handsome . He knows poetry and music ; he speaks and dances better than any other in the court . Surely it 's not hard to think well of him . ANNE BOLEYN Yes , mother . I 've been well trained . I 'm trying now. . Young ? Well , it 's true he married at eighteen , but he 's been married nearly seventeen years , and if all his children had lived , legitimate and illegitimate , there would have been at least a dozen . He can be only fairly faithful to a mistress . I think my sister Mary kept him longest . That lasted four years  --  and now that 's over . And what becomes of Mary ? No , I wo n't ask that . He 's a great king , you say . It 's true that his father , who was unscrupulous and a miser , left him a mountain of money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as for his being a great king , I rather doubt it , for he 's neither wise nor just nor merciful . You say he knows poetry and music . He 's much praised for his poetry and music at the court , where , as you have noticed , if you do n't praise him you 're likely to be unlucky . You say he speaks and dances better than any about him  --  and would n't it be a silly courtier who outdanced the proud Henry ? When it comes to warfare his wife Katharine is a better soldier than he . She won the great battle of Flodden Field while he was abroad subjugating two minor French towns with an army sufficient to conquer all Europe . A shadow moves into the darkness at stage center and HENRY 'S voice is heard p. 29 HENRY VIII Still unseenYou there ! Kindly inquire if the king may enter ! Right ! Right ! I speak to you ! A sovereign has so little privacy that he knows how to respect the privacy of others . So ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring of lightMay the king come in ? HENRY VIII That says it . That puts it bluntly . A good honest half-witted servingman you have here , if ever I saw one . Are n't you , fellow ? He claps the servant on the back SERVANT If Your Majesty please , yes , Sire . THOMAS BOLEYN Your Majesty knows that you are always welcome in this house . HENRY VIII As you in mine , Sir Thomas . And now my manners . I have greeted all here , I think , save only the Lady Anne . Sweet Nan , will you give me a kiss ? ANNE BOLEYN Yes , Your Majesty . He comes forward with his arms jovially outstretched . ANNE bows , then takes one of his hands and kisses it coolly HENRY VIII It was not such a kiss I meant , my dear . ANNE BOLEYN I have been drinking foul medicines for a cold , my lord . You would never forgive my breath . p. 30 HENRY VIII Have you tried hippocras , a strong glassful every hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HENRY VIII You shall have some of my own brewing . I 'll send it today . For your health is very dear to me , sweet Nan , and you must keep well . We live all too brief a time  --  and what little we have should not be wasted in sickness . He stoops suddenly and kisses herThere is neither fever nor medicine on your lips , sweetheart , but such a honey scent as bashful maidens breathe. . Shall I send away this chaperonage that rings us round ? ANNE BOLEYN No . HENRY VIII I will , though , by your leave ; no , without your leave . Mothers , fathers , churchmen , all these may depart . WOLSEY and the BOLEYNS , THOMAS and ELIZABETH , bow out backward toward stage rightYou would never credit how fast my heart beats , nor how hard it is to draw breath . A king is not fortunate in these matters , Nan . I come to you as frightened as a ' prentice who takes his first nosegay to a wench  --  but whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or not  --  I shall never know . I shall never be sure I have the truth  --  because I am the king , and love is paid to me like taxes. . Do me this favor , Nan . Look on me not as a monarch who commands and may demand , but as the doubting , hoping , tremulous man I am  --  wishing to be loved for myself . p. 31 ANNE BOLEYN If you were a common man , doubtful of yourself , and tremulous , would you have sent an ambassador to warn me and make sure of me ? HENRY VIII Did I send an ambassador ? ANNE BOLEYN Wolsey speaks for you , I believe . HENRY VIII Has he spoken clumsily ? ANNE BOLEYN No , very deftly . He made it plain that what the king wanted he would have . HENRY VIII Then he was clumsy . I swear to you , Nan , only this very cruel thing has happened to me : I have fallen in love . I tried to argue myself out of it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you , not to think about you , I have tangled myself deeper day by day , till now I ca n't keep it to myself . I must tell you . And ask your pity. . The truth is I dared not speak to you first myself . I was afraid . ANNE BOLEYN You were afraid ? HENRY VIII Yes . ANNE BOLEYN Of what ? HENRY VIII That you would n't care for me . ANNE BOLEYN Then perhaps you will understand the very cruel thing that has happened to me : I have fallen in love . And not with you . p. 32 HENRY VIII By God ! ANNE BOLEYN You were complaining a moment ago that such remarks were not made to kings . HENRY VIII By God , I got it full in the face that time ! Who is it ? Northumberland ? ANNE BOLEYN Would I be wise to tell you ? HENRY VIII Never mind . I know . I 've been told but I did n't believe it . How far has it gone ? ANNE BOLEYN We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOLEYN But not as my sister 's married . He would not be a complaisant husband  --  and I would not be an accessible wife . HENRY VIII All wives are accessible  --  any husband can be placated ! ANNE BOLEYN Not all . HENRY VIII Yes , all ! But I do n't want you that way ! Damn my soul , and yours  --  I want you to myself ! ANNE BOLEYN What can I do ? HENRY VIII Give up this young wattle and daub  --  give him up , I tell you , and this kingdom shall turn round you , bishops and peers  --  and whatever you 've wanted , for anyone , a knighthood , an estate , a great income rolling in forever , titles and places , you shall dispose of them just as you please ! p. 33 ANNE BOLEYN And be thrown out in the end like a dirty rag . I have n't seen Mary disposing of revenues . HENRY VIII She asked for nothing . Look , Anne , I stand here desperate . I ca n't bargain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be free . To be free to marry where I love . HENRY pauses HENRY VIII No . ANNE BOLEYN I 've seen you too close and known you too long . I 've heard what your courtiers say and then I 've seen what you are . You 're spoiled and vengeful , and malicious and bloody . The poetry they praise so much is sour , and the music you write 's worse . You dance like a hobbledehoy ; you make love as you eat  --  with a good deal of noise and no subtlety . It was my doubtful pleasure once to sleep in Mary 's room  --  or to lie awake when you thought me asleep  --  and observe the royal porpoise at play  --  HENRY VIII This is not safe . ANNE BOLEYN Yes , I 've been told it 's not safe for any of us to say no to our Squire Harry . This put-on , kindly hail-fellow-well-met of yours . My father 's house will be pulled down  --  and Northumberland 's , too , they tell me . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 34 HENRY VIII I had no wish to come here . I came because I must , and could n't help myself . Well  --  I 'm well out of it . Let it end here this morning . I thank you for your anger , and for raising anger in me . There 's no better way to make an end . Say farewell to all here . I 'll go back to my ancient wife and my cold statecraft , card houses and card empires. and card ruins . He turns ANNE BOLEYN You will not  --  touch  --  Northumberland ? HENRY VIII I 'll try not . Bloody as I am , I 'll try not . He callsWolsey ! He turns and goes into darknessWhere 's the fat saddlebags ? Where 's this vicar of hell ? The lights go out p. 35 Act 1 , Scene 3 Act One : SCENE 3 The lights come up on Anne as we saw her in the Prologue , wearing the fur-trimmed dress . The same little barred window of the Tower cell comes slowly into focus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room , and write to Northumberland in secret , saying , " I 've sent him away . Take care of yourself . But for God 's sake come if you can  --  for I 'm alone . " And I waited alone . In my little room . It was my father 's pleasure to keep me prisoner in my little room . And over and over the one dream , the one dream whenever I 'd fall asleep  --  Northumberland standing with his arms stretched out to me At stage right a figure is glimpsed in darkness and his eyes torn out and bleeding  --  We see PERCY with bloody eyes , reaching out his handsas I see him now . I tried not to sleep , for when I slept , day or night , I saw him there . Till the news came . The figure of PERCY vanishesThey would n't tell me at first . The messenger came to the kitchen . A half-light comes up at stage left . In it a courier can be seen with a woman servant COURIER I 've ridden thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Lady Anne . Nobody 's to know . He hands over a letter p. 36 WOMAN SERVANT Where are you from ? COURIER From Northumberland . Let me lie down here  --  anywhere . I 'm dead . He throws himself on the floor and sleeps instantly WOMAN SERVANT Fingering the letterIs it good or bad ? He 's under already . Man ! She shakes himMan ! Is it good or bad ? There 's no response from the courierIt ca n't be good or it ' ud ' a ' traveled slower . I 'd best keep it in my pocket . She pockets the letter . The lights go out on stage left ANNE BOLEYN But when she brought it at last it cut through my years like a dull knife through screaming flesh . I feel it yet . " I 'm a prisoner , too , and I 'm to be married , " it said . " To the Shrewsbury hag . She hates me and I hate her . One of us will murder the other . I 'm afraid God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anne , my bonny , forgive me . " Well , she did kill him . Anyway , there was no love between them , and within two years he was dead . And the king came back to Mary , and she took him , took him again , and began to have a child by him  --  and again he left her . And still I sat in my room . And again the king came to see us . MARY BOLEYN appears near stage center and speaks to Anne , who seems to sit at the window of her bedroom at the right p. 37 MARY BOLEYN Father says you 're to make yourself ready in the best you have . The king will be here tonight . Anne is silentMake yourself pretty , dear . I know you 're weary of your room . It 's you he wants to see . Make yourself charming . And do n't think of me .

MARY BOLEYN Yes  --  so  --  I mean it  --  wear the best you have . She moves toward stage rightI 'd stay and help you  --  only  --  I 'm dressing up  --  for somebody else . It 's silly , but I am . The lights go out on Mary ANNE BOLEYN Again in the Tower cellHe had been hunting , they said , and threw down his bow and said , " I must see her . " At stage right the lights come up on King Henry sitting in a hunting pavilion , stringing a bow .

HENRY VIII Give me the longbow. uoting " Who list to hunt , I know where is an hind  --  .

The lights go out on Henry and Wolsey , then , after the next scene begins , on Anne p. 39 p. 40 Act 1 , Scene 4 Act One : SCENE 4 The lights go up at stage left on a WOMAN SERVANT carrying a little table on which there is a silver basket full of cakes . A MAN SERVANT follows behind with a carved chair . WOMAN SERVANT Set it here and I 'll put the basket of cakes beside it . When I make seedcakes like these he eats the basket empty , down to the last . I 've made plenty this time . WOMAN SERVANT That 's right , feed him up and fat him . He 's got himself trained down till he can jump in the air in the middle of a dance and crack his hocks together three times . You 'll ruin that with your cakes . WOMAN SERVANT Would you have every man thin but you , you great hunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll live longer . WOMAN SERVANT He was born to be oversize . Has a king no right to be heavy ? WOMAN SERVANT Not my king hasn't. . Where do I put the chairs for the musicians ? WOMAN SERVANT Here , near His Majesty . Come in , masters . THREE MUSICIANS , with violins of the period , come in through the curtains from stage rightWe 'll put the chairs for you here , and the king himself will bring you the music . He writes a round , clear hand , music and words , and you 'll read it easily . The SERVANTS place chairs for the musicians , who sit to tune their instruments . One of them plays a little mournful sprig of a tune p. 41 WOMAN SERVANT When you 've finished with that sad kind of stuff there 's sweet sack in the buttery. 1ST MUSICIAN We 'll have it afterward , if you 'll save it . Here they come . The whole stage begins to light up . The curtains at the rear now look like a wall tapestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' stools and the king 's chair and table are seen at stage right . ELIZABETH and MARY enter , dressed for a formal occasion . ANNE follows them MARY BOLEYN There was more than a little talk about you and the king  --  when you were young . ELIZABETH BOLEYN Well , be sure it all came to nothing , and none of you children are his  --  though I 'm not sure I could have held him off if he 'd tried hard for me . We were about of an age , and we danced together a good deal , and he had the face of an angel in those days . And danced like an angel . But he was nave and gentle  --  and I think he 'd have been afraid to ask me . There was something innocent and pure about him then . He wanted to be a good king . He wanted to be a great king  --  almost a Messiah . MARY BOLEYN He 's changed indeed . ELIZABETH BOLEYN Yes . He reads Machiavelli now . ELIZABETH and MARY take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me first , he was still nave . He was afraid of women who might be difficult . He wanted someone to whom he could say , " Open , sesame , " and she 'd open . I 'm afraid that 's what attracted him to me . He said , " Open , sesame , " and there I was . His  --  his mule . It 's his own word . ELIZABETH BOLEYN You may yet be the mother of a king of England . ANNE sits beside her mother MARY BOLEYN Small chance of that . And small reward in it . ELIZABETH BOLEYN It 's more than I 've ever had  --  of anything . And it wo n't happen so easily again . He 's grown infinitely more complex  --  and brutal . He wants a woman who will resist  --  a woman hardly won , a Roman conquest . ANNE BOLEYN I 've hated him from the beginning . I hate him now . ELIZABETH BOLEYN That 's what he wants . ANNE BOLEYN I hate him and I hate Wolsey . What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it will kill me too . ELIZABETH BOLEYN If women died as easily as men there would be no women in this world . MARY BOLEYN If you ever go to him , lock up your heart , never surrender yourself , keep a cold reserve of hate and anger and laughter and unfaith  --  p. 43 ANNE BOLEYN Thank you  --  I shall not go to him . MARY BOLEYN For the moment you are won and conquered and a worshiper he will give you back to yourself and walk away . He 'll want no more of you . ANNE BOLEYN I sha n't go to him , nor let him come to me . I 'm not sure I shall live . Tell me why I should wish to live . THOMAS BOLEYN enters from stage left THOMAS BOLEYN Are we ready ? ELIZABETH BOLEYN Quite ready , Thomas . THOMAS BOLEYN I think the king is waiting and anxious . ELIZABETH BOLEYN We are waiting . BOLEYN crosses the stage and looks within the curtains at stage left , then returns to stand behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musicians . KING HENRY comes from stage left , his hands full of manuscripts . The women rise and bow . WOLSEY follows HENRY in and waits HENRY VIII I am not here tonight as your king . Something was said at one time  --  I forget by whom  --  about my bad poetry and bad music . It rankled deep  --  but then I saw that there was only one answer : to write great poetry and great music . And since I have a cause for anguish in my life , and songs come out of anguish , I have heard these strains in the night when I woke out of sleep , and I have risen and written them down . Many songs came to me . This is only one . It may be it is not a great song , but when I hear it I know it sings what is in my heart  --  the pain and the loss and the parting that 's like death . Here are your parts , masters . Play it and sing it as it is written , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of a grief . The KING sits in his chair after giving out the music . The MUSICIANS look over the parts briefly , then the leader raps for attention and they begin . Wolsey stands behind the king p. 44 SINGERS Alas , alas , What shall I doFor love , for love , Alas what shall I do  --  Since now so kind I do you find  --  To keep you me unto ? To keep you me unto ? Oh my heart , Oh my heart , My heart it is so sore , Since I must needs from my love depart , And know no cause therefore  --  And know no cause therefore ! The SINGERS go out stage right . HENRY crosses to Anne HENRY VIII The music will now play a saraband of my writing . Will you dance it with me , Nan ? ANNE looks down at the floor for a moment , rises silently and puts out her hands for the dance . The music begins and they take the first steps of the saraband . Then the lights dim down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry and Anne . The music hushes to pianissimo , so that we can hear their voices . They cease dancing , and now we see only their two faces motionless in a medallion of light ANNE BOLEYN Northumberland is dead . HENRY VIII Not by my order . ANNE BOLEYN You sent him to marry elsewhere  --  and it killed him . HENRY VIII I could n't let him marry you . I tried  --  but I couldn't. p. 45 ANNE BOLEYN When I look in your face I see his murderer . HENRY VIII I have learned something that makes me very humble , Nan . One can not choose where he will love . Even a king can not choose . I tried again and again to love elsewhere . I did n't want to come here , this year or last . But here I am . Bringing you the best I have  --  my music and my poetry and my love for you . ANNE BOLEYN Even if I loved you , you offer me nothing . You 're not free . HENRY VIII Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY VIII Does that matter to a king ? A king makes his own rules . ANNE BOLEYN Does he ? A king or no king , if he 's married he 's not free . HENRY VIII If you loved me you 'd find me free . ANNE BOLEYN From your marriage ? HENRY VIII Here is my marriage , Nan . My older brother Arthur was heir to the kingdom . To make an alliance with Spain he married Katharine of Aragon . Then Arthur died  --  and I was heir to the throne of England . To continue the alliance with Spain I was advised to marry Arthur 's widow , six years my senior . And I did . At seventeen I married her . I never loved her . I should never have married my brother 's widow . There 's a curse on the marriage . We can not have sons . Our sons are all born dead . There is no heir male to the English crown because of this accursed union . The kingdom faces anarchy when I die , and I face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male heir  --  yet because of the church and our friendship with Spain , I remain Katharine 's husband . More than anything in this world I want a son , and she ca n't give me one  --  yet I must not publicly put her aside . Do you understand now ? This marriage is a form  --  important only in statecraft and churchcraft , not to you or me. p. 46 ANNE BOLEYN Important or not , you ca n't break it . It 's stronger than you are  --  and so you offer me nothing . HENRY VIII It 's not nothing , Nan . It 's my whole life . I know because I tried to erase you and fill my life with other things . It wo n't work , I can think of nothing but you . She has been looking straight into his eyes . She drops her headIt 's not only this pain , this stitch in the side , this poetry I ca n't keep from writing , this music that I hear when I think of you and must write down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you  --  and only you . I find myself  --  when I 'm talking to an ambassador , perhaps  --  I find myself thinking of you . And what am I thinking ? Of you and me playing at dog and bitch . Of you and me playing at horse and mare . Of you and me every way there is . I want to fill you up  --  night after night . I want to fill you with sons . ANNE BOLEYN Bastards ? For they would be bastards , you know . There is a long pause . The music stops . The lights come up on the whole scene , revealing Henry and Anne in the middle of the stage , the others watching HENRY VIII If you say one more word I shall strike you . One word more . ANNE BOLEYN In his teethBut it 's quite obvious that if you and I had children they would be bastards . There is another long pause , then HENRY strikes Anne heavily across the face . She goes down to one knee . WOLSEY and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARDINAL WOLSEY LowYour Majesty . ANNE gets slowly to her feet , a little dazed , then faces the king ANNE BOLEYN You have not yet understood what I mean , I think . What I am trying to tell you is that you not only offer me nothing  --  you offer yourself nothing . You say you want a son , an heir to the throne . You need such an heir , and the kingdom needs him . But an heir must be legitimate  --  not baseborn  --  and while you are married to Katharine you can have only bastards . Fill me with as many sons as you like , you would still have no heir , and I would have  --  nothing . As for your music and your poetry and your love for me  --  you know I do n't love you . You 've given me good reason not to love you . HENRY VIII Would you marry me if I were free of Katharine ? ANNE BOLEYN You ca n't get free of Katharine . You know that And I know it . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to marry you , and would make you queen of England , would you marry me ? There is a long pause ANNE BOLEYN None of these things could be . Yes . If you 'll make me queen of England I will marry you . HENRY VIII Wolsey ! p. 48 CARDINAL WOLSEY We can do many things , as you know , my sovereign . We can shake the thrones of the Emperor and of the King of France . We can sometimes get our way in Rome . But this we could not do . Try to divorce Katharine and you 'll have the whole world against you . You 'll be at war with all Europe . ANNE BOLEYN Very well . HENRY VIII You knew you 'd get this answer . ANNE BOLEYN Yes . I knew it . CARDINAL WOLSEY The king asks very little of you , Anne . Any other woman would give it readily . ANNE BOLEYN Out of fear . CARDINAL WOLSEY No . ANNE BOLEYN Out of gratitude , then . But I 'm not flattered , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me queen of England I will give him boys in plenty . But I will take nothing less . HENRY VIII It 's true that I go through life dragging a sick woman  --  cold and sick  --  blotched and middle-aged  --  and fanatic  --  who can give neither pleasure nor a living son . I have worked at that long enough , I think . I know what can come from that bed . There never was much need for the hair shirt she wears next her skin . And none now . CARDINAL WOLSEY Any son of the king could be made legitimate  --  could be made the heir . p. 49 HENRY VIII Yes . It 's true . ANNE BOLEYN Your Majesty already has a natural son . Have you made him the heir ? Is he legitimate ? CARDINAL WOLSEY He 's made Duke of Richmond . ANNE BOLEYN Could the Duke of Richmond inherit the throne ? CARDINAL WOLSEY He may . It could be . The lad 's not well . Not like to live . ANNE BOLEYN But he would come first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It happens that any baseborn son I might have would be younger than Mary 's . Her child would come before mine . My entry would be third . Now we are affectionate sisters , Mary and I. We forgive each other the little things that sisters must forgive . Yet she would rather her son sat on the throne than mine . I 'd rather mine than hers . I 'd rather have no son than a son baseborn . HENRY VIII I shall rid myself of Katharine . I shall make this girl queen . I shall settle the question of the succession once for all ! CARDINAL WOLSEY Oh , my lord , I beg you , as your faithful servant , I beg you , do n't promise this now . It may mean your death  --  or the loss of your kingdom  --  Or her death . You are not yourself . This is not a small error . It  --  p. 50 HENRY VIII I shall make this girl queen . CARDINAL WOLSEY She 's never said she loved you ! HENRY VIII I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two like an apple and flings the halves into the void , I shall make her queen . The lights go out@@ A center of light comes up on Anne at stage right , in the furred gown of the Prologue the barred window behind her . ANNE BOLEYN He knew very well I 'd love him when once he 'd made me his . And so it was . This is the night on which he made me his  --  the night I write here . After that night I loved him more and more and hated him less and less  --  and I was lost . The lights dim down@@ The curtain rises in darkness , then the lights come up on Henry , alone , seated stage left at a table with a paper before him and a quill peny ready to sign .

What will it seem to men I was like when I did this ? It will be written and studied . The histories of kings are not secure . The letters they have hidden , the secret ciphers are unraveled and chuckled over . " He loved her and he had her and he killed her , " the books will say . The letters will be printed , the stolen love letters where I played the fool like a country boy to his milkmaid . There 's a heart drawn at the bottom of one , and in the heart " A. B.

The lights dim down on Henry , coming up on stage right and center , though we still see the king as he watches the first scene@@ Four players sit about a card table at stage right . They are Anne Boleyn ; Mark Smeaton , a good-looking young gallant ; Jane Seymour , a girl of Anne 's own age  --  lady in waiting to Anne ; and Henry Norris , a gentleman about the court . About them are grouped , some sitting , some standing , Elizabeth and Thomas Boleyn ; the old Duke of Norfolk , Anne 's uncle ; Madge Shelton , another of Anne 's waiting women ; and Sir Thomas More , who stands watching in half-shadow .

She picks up her cards MARK SMEATON I 'm afraid this is not a game for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear . MARK SMEATON Touch . I 'll risk one noble . NORRIS turns up a card HENRY NORRIS Seven of diamonds . You win . You have the nine there . MARK SMEATON So I do . HENRY NORRIS Here 's your noble . ANNE BOLEYN I 'll bet what 's on the table . HENRY NORRIS Ah , you have four kings . You could n't possibly lose . He turns up a cardAnd you do n't . ANNE BOLEYN Is there no way I could bet more ? HENRY NORRIS None , alas . It 's the chances of war . Like Alexander , you ca n't win more than there is at stake . p. 57 THOMAS BOLEYN Do you need money , Jane ? JANE SEYMOUR No , I 'm even so far . NORRIS pushes the money toward Anne HENRY NORRIS Another gold noble , please . All round . They ante THOMAS BOLEYN I ask because the king 's treasury stands behind you tonight JANE SEYMOUR Why does it , sir ? THOMAS BOLEYN Because you are sitting in the king 's chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the resources of the king . I have known an earl to lose a thousand pounds in that seat , and walk away paying nothing because the king 's treasury paid . JANE SEYMOUR But if he had won ? THOMAS BOLEYN Oh , what you win you keep . HENRY NORRIS Now , that 's the way to live . MARK SMEATON Aye . That 's the arrangement I 'd like to have with my bankers . THOMAS MORE How men love injustice . HENRY NORRIS Do n't they ? They know what would happen to them if they got what they earned . ANNE BOLEYN Do you love justice , Sir Thomas ? p. 58 THOMAS MORE Now where would I have seen it ? Henry is seen standing at the entrance , listeningStill , men do seem to get what they deserve  --  in a rough way  --  over a long period . ANNE BOLEYN You think so , truly ? THOMAS MORE Well , it 's my guess . There 's no proving it . Nobody 's ever made up the accounts . Think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon our follies and sins and good deeds , and decide what we should get . Think of the decisions they 'd have to make  --  and revise . And reverse . Think of the good deeds that turned out badly  --  and of the murders that turned out to be a good thing . Yet  --  on the whole  --  it 's my guess that what should come to a man does come to him . ANNE BOLEYN Or to a woman . THOMAS MORE They 're not exempt . HENRY NORRIS I wonder who makes these intricate calcuations . For example , I slapped my wife last Thursday . Now I thought it was good for her . I think she thought it was bad for her . Anyway , she gave me a black mark for it . But suppose it definitely improved her character ? What mark would heaven give me for it ? ANNE BOLEYN Think what it did to your character . p. 59 HENRY NORRIS That 's another complication . It may have been bad for my moral structure to slap my wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a martyr , having sacrificed myself , and acquired a black mark , in order to make her a better woman ? ANNE BOLEYN There must be a machine up above that computes these things , and filters them automatically  --  and keeps the score . THOMAS MORE But who built it ? And suppose it gets out of order ? DUKE OF NORFOLK It 's out of order all the time . I know . I 've been watching it these many years . ELIZABETH BOLEYN There may have been an error in it from the beginning . THOMAS MORE But somehow we came here . Somehow we are as we are . HENRY NORRIS We 're not as you made us in Utopia . DUKE OF NORFOLK I hope God 's happy in heaven . And got what he wanted . MARK SMEATON It 's your play , Norris . HENRY NORRIS I 'll stay out of it . I 've nothing here . Turn in your hands and Jane will shuffle and deal . They throw in their cards . SIR THOMAS WYATT comes in from stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Sir Thomas  --  and the evening grows more and more literary ! MARK SMEATON Take my chair , Wyatt . I do n't half like this game . ANNE BOLEYN Let 's break it up . Tommy promised to bring a poem if it was finished  --  and might even read it for us . Wo n't you ? THOMAS WYATT It 's the usual thing . After you 've written a poem , you read it . And then , if you 're a man of sense , you run for your life . Any other poets present ? THOMAS MORE Only a plodding prose writer , friend . THOMAS WYATT They 're the worst , of course . They hold all prose superior to all verse . THOMAS MORE True . And make no distinctions . Read your bad verses , man . THOMAS WYATT My bad verses ? THOMAS MORE All verse is bad . Its intention is to mislead . ANNE BOLEYN Is this a quarrel ? THOMAS MORE Oh , an ancient one , my dear . A quarrel to the death , but unimportant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish saying this to wise and learned men , but one thing we must not forget here in the court . It 's the things we say and do here that set the pace for what is said and done in England . If Sir Thomas More is honored at court for his Utopia , then he is honored through England . If Sir Thomas Wyatt 's verses are read at court , then through England men will want to read them  --  and it will be , well , honorable to write verses . And we should be aware of this  --  p. 61 THOMAS MORE But not too much aware  --  THOMAS WYATT Lest the verses should not be good . ANNE BOLEYN Do I speak too much like a queen ? I am not queen yet , as you know , and yet if I am not queen there is no queen in England  --  for Katharine says nothing , is never sure  --  and the things a queen should do are not done . THOMAS MORE If you are hoping for a renaissance of letters  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nan , I fear you 're ahead of your time . Men are always hoping for that kind of thing  --  and how often does it happen ? Well  --  it happened once , in Greece , as everybody knows , and a sort of substitute renaissance happened in Rome later on . But that 's all . The rest is darkness through all Europe , through all later time . I hardly think we shall roll it back with our few books and sonnets . ANNE BOLEYN But you write your books . THOMAS MORE I write them . I hope for no great upswing  --  till all men are free  --  and changed . MADGE SHELTON Still , I 'd like to hear the poem . ANNE BOLEYN Yes , Tommy . THOMAS WYATT Only if it 's unanimous . p. 62 DUKE OF NORFOLK It 's unanimous , lad . I know nothing about poetry , but I 'll sit quiet and make the proper faces . ANNE BOLEYN No excuse  --  no haw , no hem  --  no hanging back . Sit in the light here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read : They flee from me that sometime did me seek , &nbsp; &nbsp; With naked foot stalking within my chamber:Once I have seen them gentle , tame , and meek , &nbsp; &nbsp; That now are wild , and do not once rememberThat sometime they have put themselves in dangerTo take bread at my hand ; and now they range , &nbsp; &nbsp; Busily seeking in continual change . MARK SMEATON Is this about birds or women ? ANNE BOLEYN Hush ! DUKE OF NORFOLK It 's about his women , son . Nobody has that much bellyache over birds . THOMAS WYATT The advantage of poetry is that nobody knows what it means . Thanked be fortune , it hath been otherwise , &nbsp; &nbsp; Twenty times better ; but once especial , In thin array , after a pleasant guise , &nbsp; &nbsp; When her loose gown did from her shoulders fall , And she me caught in her arms long and small , And therewithal so sweetly did me kiss , &nbsp; &nbsp; And softly said , " Dear heart , how like you this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his troubles with human females . THOMAS WYATT In the interests of the renaissance I continue . It was no dream ; for I lay broad awaking : &nbsp; &nbsp; But all is turned now , through my gentleness , Into a bitter fashion of forsaking ; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I have leave to go of her goodness ; And she also to use new-fangleness.But since that I unkindly am so served , &nbsp; &nbsp; " How like you this ? "  --  What hath she now deserved ? THOMAS MORE We were talking about that before you came in  --  about what people deserve , and whether they get it . Always , never , or sometimes . HENRY VIII Speaking out of half-darknessAll three , I think . Some get it always , some get it never , some get it sometimes . The court rises and bowsSit , sit , bend no more , either at the half or the quarter or the three-quarters . Relax necks , knees , and middles , and , if you 'll be more comfortable , unbutton . I 'm unbuttoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , probably what I feel now is my just desert. . Did nobody understand that ? ANNE BOLEYN We were being very quiet and respectful , my good lord . p. 64 HENRY VIII You were indeed . What 's in the air tonight ? ANNE BOLEYN Henry Norris has taught us a new card game from Paris and Sir Thomas Wyatt has read us a poem about women . DUKE OF NORFOLK His women . ANNE BOLEYN I gathered they 're not his women any more . HENRY VIII SittingYou 'll forgive me for this , I know  --  I listened for a few moments before I entered . I said to myself , " Let me hear what my court 's like when I 'm not there . " I listened to you all . And I believe we have now in England what no king of this island has ever had before , a beginning of those things that take a nation upstream to greatness . Quick minds , critical , witty , and yet willing to say , " Yes , this is good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fun in him , and a poet who can write lines that catch at the heart . We have not had this before . We have had a dull court . Religious and dutiful and dull . And the change has come with this my Nan , who stands embarrassed before you , and wants to quiet me . Come and quiet me with a kiss on the mouth , Nan , for you 've brought me a nest of singing birds here , and for the first time I begin to believe I may go down as a great king , after a great reign , and over a great nation . Since you do n't come to kiss me I go to kiss you . He does soThis is what I 've always wanted , you know , to feel a stirring of minds about me , to feel that my age will not go back into death without leaving a little something for men to recollect . . I wish I could spend my time here , and not with legates and ambassadors and politicians , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , and all year , and the years before  --  and as if that were not enough here comes another set of them , and I must send away these larks my lover has gathered and go back to the quarrel among rats and hogs . WOLSEY and CROMWELL appear in the half-lightCome in , gentlemen . Come in , my good Cardinal , you who labor while I sleep . The May flies are about to depart and we must go to work . A general exodus begins , to make way for the business sessionWyatt , it 's good poetry . It will need more than one reading . p. 65 THOMAS WYATT Then I 'm afraid it needs another writing . He goes HENRY VIII Maybe , maybe . Try it , try it . More , it 's more than four years since we sat on the palace roof together and considered the motions of the stars . THOMAS MORE They have n't changed much , Your Majesty . He follows Wyatt HENRY VIII That 's the saddest subject I know , astronomy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subjects are no different . DUKE OF NORFOLK It 's a lie , Majesty . The kings can coin money and the subjects ca n't . HENRY VIII Under heaven that means nothing , Norfolk . DUKE OF NORFOLK Over hell it means a good deal . And I 'm old enough to feel pretty close to hell . And I resent the king coining money when I ca n't ! Especially when he cuts down the silver by half , and doubles the number of shillings in a pound ! He goes HENRY VIII You know , he has hold of something there . It was not quite honest , but I needed the money and I had to do it . THOMAS BOLEYN Good night , my lord . HENRY VIII Good night , my treasurer . Here 's one man who knows how desperately I had to do it . Good night , good night . The last of the courtiers go , leaving only Henry , Anne , Wolsey and Cromwell p. 66 ANNE BOLEYN I 'll leave you two to conspire . HENRY VIII Stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . CARDINAL WOLSEY What I have to say is for Your Majesty 's private ear . HENRY VIII I have no private ear  --  not from Nan . CARDINAL WOLSEY Shifting quicklyTo be frank , it could go till tomorrow . I 'm sorry I interrupted . Shall we call the court back ? HENRY VIII Come , come , what barrel of herrings is this you do n't want to broach before Nan ? CARDINAL WOLSEY My king , let us have the poets again  --  HENRY VIII On pain of my displeasure  --  what did you come here to say ? CARDINAL WOLSEY After a moment 's hesitationFor the preservation of your good fortune  --  and that of England  --  I must endure your displeasure . HENRY VIII AngryIt has been your habit lately to slight my wife and overlook her presence and counsel ! Speak now  --  and before her ! CARDINAL WOLSEY Why , if I must , I shall . Our messenger returned from Rome today . We have the last word from that quarter . p. 67 HENRY VIII Oh ? CARDINAL WOLSEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? CARDINAL WOLSEY The Pope will not annul your marriage to Katharine . HENRY VIII But he must . CARDINAL WOLSEY He will not . He makes it quite definite and final . HENRY VIII But what reason can he give ? CARDINAL WOLSEY The reason he gives is unimportant . The true reason is that he is a prisoner , and can not grant it . HENRY VIII What kind of prisoner ? CARDINAL WOLSEY An actual one . He was just about to annul your marriage to Katharine . He had quite sufficient ground for it  --  she was your brother 's widow , and that 's enough . But now the Emperor Charles has invaded Italy and captured the Vatican . He can give orders there and does . And the Emperor Charles is Katharine 's nephew , and he does n't want his aunt divorced from you . Pope Clement has been forbidden to favor us in the matter . HENRY VIII How do you know this ? CARDINAL WOLSEY From my agents in Rome. . Times will change , of course . There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there can be no divorce this year . p. 68 HENRY VIII There must be a divorce this year . Nan is with child  --  and her child must be heir to the throne . CARDINAL WOLSEY I warned you when you first contemplated this marriage  --  ANNE BOLEYN It was you who came first to me , demanding me for King Henry ! CARDINAL WOLSEY There was no thought of marriage at that time . ANNE BOLEYN You are a man of the church ! You speak for the church ! CARDINAL WOLSEY I am King Henry 's minister . I speak for what can be done . I speak against what can not . HENRY VIII You will somehow get this divorce for me . CARDINAL WOLSEY My king , you and I have worked together on this . We 've tried everyting we could lay hands or wits on . To AnneFor two years , Lady Anne , step by step , with patience and cunning and the best skill there is about us , we have tried to bring about the divorce from Katharine . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , which is true , that from the beginning he and she had been living in mortal sin . She refused him . As for me , I have marshaled cardinals and bishops like storm troops to assail the Pope 's position . I have tried from every angle , from every direction , with money , influence , and temporal power . I have run my head against this wall like a bull in a stone barn  --  till there 's blood dripping in my eyes and I 'm worn out . And when we were about to win  --  when the wall was crumbling and going down before us  --  the Emperor broke into Italy and made the church his vassal . In that situation I 'm powerless . And so is Henry . p. 69 ANNE BOLEYN What are we to do ? CARDINAL WOLSEY Live as you were . Live as you are . Wait . ANNE BOLEYN Children do n't wait for these changes among the dynasties . They come at their own time , convenient or inconvenient . They do n't wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed , my lord ? HENRY VIII Yes . WOLSEY and CROMWELL bow and go out stage rightI hoped to win suddenly and have good news for you some morning , but it has n't come . This comes instead. . Am I forgiven , Nan ? He puts his hand over hers ANNE BOLEYN Is anything ever forgiven ? HENRY VIII Is that your answer ? ANNE BOLEYN How do I know what you 've agreed with Wolsey ? In all your pacts with kings and princes of the whole earth , I 've never known you to tell the truth  --  never ! HENRY VIII But I 've told it to you ! ANNE BOLEYN I thought you had . I 've tried to take the place you wanted me to take  --  and do what must be done  --  because I had promised , and you had promised . But what I feared has come about  --  HENRY leaps to his feet p. 70 HENRY VIII God in Heaven damn this spotted bitch ! To be called a liar by my own bitch ! Damn you ! ANNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've never yet told truth when a lie would serve ! And we had a bargain , remember . I said , " If you will make me queen I will marry you ! " But our marriage was at night and in secret ; the church does not hold it valid ; I am not the queen , and my child will not inherit the throne ! Was this planned ? It 's like many plans I 've known you to make ! HENRY VIII I 'll strangle you yet ! I 'll make an end of you ! ANNE BOLEYN No doubt . HENRY VIII You 've lied at times ! And to me ! What 's all this sudden passion about lying ? ANNE BOLEYN I could have said , " I love you , I love you , I love you ! " I did n't say it . Because I do n't . And whether you love me I do n't know . You 've been unfaithful to me often enough  --  and I 've known where and with whom ! HENRY VIII If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned mocking face watching me through the walls ! You spoil everything for me ! Faithful  --  what kind of faith do you want of me ? To be impotent in every bed but yours ? Well , that 's happened , too ! They 've laughed at me in their beds  --  more than one . Laughed at their king  --  and he impotent  --  with all but you ! It 's as if you were a disease in me  --  so that I 'm in a fever when you 're with me and a fever when you 're absent  --  and it grows worse with the years that should burn it out ! What more can I give , in faith or anything I have ? p. 71 ANNE BOLEYN What you promised ! What you gave your pledged word to do ? HENRY VIII GentlyAnne  --  I have tried . Not always the right way , perhaps , but my best . ANNE BOLEYN You see  --  if I have a child before this divorce is granted  --  well , you are still as you are , untouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anne . And it 's unfair . But it 's not what I meant . I meant it all quite honestly  --  quite as I said . I like what you 've done with the court . I want you for my queen . I 've lied to all the others , but not to you. . Why must she anger me ? Why am I tied to this alabaster face and this pinched-up mouth and these slanted eyes ? A shadow moves at stage right and Cromwell 's voice is heard THOMAS CROMWELL May I come in , Your Majesty ? HENRY VIII AngryWho is it ? Who disturbs me here ? THOMAS CROMWELL I am the lord Cardinal 's secretary , Your Majesty . My name is Cromwell . HENRY VIII Stay out ! No  --  come in . CROMWELL approachesYou were just here . THOMAS CROMWELL Yes , Majesty . He bows p. 72 HENRY VIII Well , what do you want ? Has the Cardinal forgotten something ? THOMAS CROMWELL He forgets nothing , my liege , except his duty to his king . HENRY VIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean that Your Majesty may have your divorce , and the Lady Anne be crowned queen , and the child to come made heir apparent very simply . It needs only the will to do it . HENRY VIII Whose will ? THOMAS CROMWELL The Cardinal 's . He has something else in mind . He 's playing his hand to get himself made pope in Rome . He 's not thinking of you or your divorce . HENRY VIII You have been dismissed once  --  now once again ! ANNE BOLEYN What makes you say this ? THOMAS CROMWELL I know it . HENRY VIII I 've worked with Wolsey . This man is mad or fanatic  --  ANNE BOLEYN If the Pope will not grant the divorce  --  and ca n't grant it  --  how can any of these things you say be done ? THOMAS CROMWELL Forgive me , Your Majesty . I am not a fanatic , not a madman . All my life I have been an earnest student at the inns of court . I have read the laws of England , something which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law of this land that makes it treason to acknowledge any higher authority than the will of the king . The church in England must grant the king a divorce if he wishes it . To maintain that the Pope may govern the king in such a matter  --  or in any matter  --  is traitorous and punishable by death . Say this to Cardinal Wolsey . He will turn white to the roots of his beard . For he too knows of this law. . To bring about all these things you wish , the king has only to appoint a new primate who will legalize his divorce and a new marriage . p. 73 HENRY VIII That would mean excommunication and a complete break with Rome . If there is such a law . THOMAS CROMWELL Yes , Majesty . But there is such a law . Of that you may be sure . It is called the law of praemunire . HENRY VIII I have always been a defender of the faith . And of the church . That is my greatest strength with my people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say a word on that subject , Your Grace . As matters stand you are but half a king . We are only half-subject to you . If you were truly king in England could a foreign prelate call you to account ? England is only half-free . You are only half-free . What the king of England wants he should have , without hindrance from abroad . HENRY VIII DrylyI fear such independence might be purchased very dearly . THOMAS CROMWELL Dearly ? You have sometimes found yourself in need of money , Your Majesty . HENRY VIII Well ? THOMAS CROMWELL At one stroke you could obtain your divorce and make yourself the wealthiest monarch in Europe . The monasteries of England are richer than the gold mines of the new world . Quarrel with Rome , set yourself at the head of the English church , and these riches are yours . p. 74 HENRY VIII You are a man without scruple , Master Cromwell . THOMAS CROMWELL Entirely without scruple , Your Majesty . I have learned my trade , as you know , under Cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of the church properties which the Cardinal has already condemned for his own use . And an itemized history of how and where he obtained the furnishings for his palace at York  --  as well as the titles to the estate . Cardinal Wolsey is a richer man than you , Your Majesty . HENRY VIII For the third time , you are dismissed , Master Cromwell. . But I shall be able to find you if I need you ? THOMAS CROMWELL Yes , Your Majesty . ANNE BOLEYN I should like to see those papers . THOMAS CROMWELL Smiling grimlyYes , Your Majesty . He hands the papers to Anne and goes ANNE BOLEYN After a pauseDo you think he tells the truth ? HENRY VIII There would be little point in his coming to us unless he told the truth . ANNE BOLEYN Is there such a law ? HENRY VIII I 've never heard of it , but he convinces me there is. p. 75 ANNE BOLEYN Who has the papers before her The Cardinal seems to have stolen an immense amount of money . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I knew . Though I 'm not exactly innocent in the matter . We sometimes went halves . ANNE BOLEYN Are you also a pupil of the Cardinal 's ? HENRY VIII I am the son of Henry the Seventh . I studied under a real master  --  my father . Whatever crookedness was lacking in the world when my father was born he invented before he left it . No other king of our island ever stole so widely , so successfully , so secretly  --  or died so rich . And the central principle he taught me was this : always keep the church on your side . ANNE BOLEYN Then he did n't steal from the church ? HENRY VIII Oh , yes . He stole from everybody . But not enough to turn it against him . I 've stolen from the church too . But not enough to turn it against me . So far . ANNE BOLEYN If this law exists  --  you could have the divorce , we could be married legally  --  and you could be richer than your father . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turn or two up and down as he speaksAnd of my father 's advice . And they pull me two ways. . I 'm your prisoner , Nan . Little as I like it , I 'm your prisoner , and I mean to make you my queen . You 've never told me you loved me . But if you were my queen  --  it would happen . You would say it and it would be true. . And now a hatch opens . As if in the floor . It may be I could make you my queen at once . And make myself wealthy beyond hope  --  but I 'd have to make the church my enemy . p. 76 ANNE BOLEYN And you love me  --  not quite enough . HENRY VIII Suppose I set out to make myself head of the church . I shall be opposed by many who are now my friends . They will be guilty of treason and I shall have to kill them . Those whom I like best  --  those who have some integrity of mind  --  will speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation can then be bludgeoned into silence  --  but a lot of blood will run before they 're quiet . Most of my people will hate me  --  and even more will hate you . Yes , I can make my Nan queen  --  but we must consider the price . In how much we dare be hated . Are we willing to pay it ? ANNE BOLEYN I am . HENRY VIII You are new at this work , of course . You do n't know quite what it means . To see blood run . If you knew , I wonder if you 'd still wish it . ANNE BOLEYN I am with child HENRY comes back to his chair HENRY VIII The altar at St. Paul 's will stand ankle-deep in blood . The shopkeepers will mop blood from their floors. . But it must be done if we 're to marry . Well , so be it . ANNE BOLEYN Must so many die ? HENRY VIII Many must die . And it will look as if I had done this for money . Like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HENRY VIII It was his main source of income  --  to attaint a well-lined noble for treason , do away with him , and take what he had . It brought in millions . I 've been trying not to think of that . ANNE BOLEYN Do n't think of it . HENRY VIII It will bring in the money anyway . And  --  the money would be useful . If only you could love me a little  --  no , not a little  --  with your whole heart. then  --  it would n't matter what happened  --  or what 's thought of me . ANNE BOLEYN Putting out her handSometimes  --  no . If you were ever honest  --  if you were ever true. HENRY VIII Taking her handYes ? ANNE BOLEYN But you never are . The lights go out p. 78 Act 2 , Scene 2 Act Two : SCENE 2 A great sunburst window brightens first , then we see York Palace . NORFOLK and CROMWELL enter to the window and listen to the sounds of cheering without . A few voices cry : VOICES Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A VOICE Long live Queen Katharine ! Long live  --  VOICES Down with him ! He took foreign money ! Long live Queen Anne ! DUKE OF NORFOLK It seems to me the shouting for Queen Anne was somewhat sparse along the streets  --  not what you 'd expect for a royal wedding and a coronation . You should have paid them a bit and we 'd have heard something really spontaneous . THOMAS CROMWELL They were paid . DUKE OF NORFOLK How many of them ? THOMAS CROMWELL A thousand apprentices . DUKE OF NORFOLK How much were they paid ? THOMAS CROMWELL One groat each . DUKE OF NORFOLK A groat ? Man , that wo n't buy a whole drink of good liquor ! They should have had a silver penny apiece and they 'd have shaken the foundations ! They 'd have rung the bells ! They 'd have jumped out of windows ! Anyway , they 'd have thrown their caps in the air ! The rabble I saw must have had the mange . Their headgear was stuck tight on their skulls and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOMAS CROMWELL For a half-crown each , or a whole one , they would n't cheer Queen Anne  --  not as they 'd like to be cheering Queen Katharine . DUKE OF NORFOLK Why man , have you lost faith in money ? And in King Henry ? They 'll go along with Henry in time . Give him a few years and he 'll make them love this queen as much as the first . THOMAS CROMWELL Those that were yelling loudest were calling her a whore . DUKE OF NORFOLK Those were paid , too , Cromwell . Those were paid , too  --  and probably more . By the Spanish ambassador . Or by our friend Wolsey . I 'm pretty sure they were paid more than you paid , because what they shouted came straight from the heart . The cheering begins again VOICES God save Queen Anne ! HENRY and ANNE enter from the right and pause to listen to the cheering ANNE BOLEYN Was n't it rather flimsy applause ? DUKE OF NORFOLK Nonsense , Your Majesty . It was what you always get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too deep for noise . They just stand there and weep . ANNE BOLEYN Uncle , uncle , you 're an unprincipled old sinner . There were no tears . They did n't even bother to uncover . p. 80 HENRY VIII Let 's be thankful for the friends we have , my dear . Will you be happy here ? ANNE BOLEYN I 've never known there was anything so perfect in England . HENRY VIII There is n't , anywhere else . This must have been his library . THOMAS CROMWELL Yes , it was . He worked in this room . HENRY VIII And so , will you be happy ? ANNE BOLEYN Who else will live here ? HENRY VIII Only you . ANNE BOLEYN There 's room for so many . HENRY VIII There 'll be no apartment here for anyone save you . Not even for me unless you ask me . ANNE BOLEYN I 've never had a place that was mine . THOMAS CROMWELL There 's someone here .

Go on with whatever you have in hand , you young people . I 'm only finishing an inventory for the new owner . THOMAS CROMWELL His Majesty waits for you to rise , Cardinal Wolsey . p. 81 CARDINAL WOLSEY You must forgive me . I can rise only with assistance . My legs are not for dancing , any more . But the inventory 's ready , and now I write my name . He writes ANNE BOLEYN I 'm afraid we disturb you here . CARDINAL WOLSEY It 's better that you should . The palace is much too beautiful for an old man . It needs youth in it . Here 's the paper . I 'm sorry that I ca n't rise and bring it to you  --  or kneel before you . I can only reach it out .

CARDINAL WOLSEY It was my intention to be gone when you came , my lord , but some friends of mine were here , and they wished to see you , and they persuaded me to stay . HENRY VIII Some friends of yours ? CARDINAL WOLSEY And of yours . Sir Thomas More , Bishop Fisher , and John Houghton , Prior to the Charter House in London . p. 82 HENRY VIII They are here ? CARDINAL WOLSEY Yes . Will you see them ? HENRY VIII We thought to escape conferences this one day , but He looks at Annekings and queens are never excused . Let them come in . WOLSEY claps his hands and THREE MEN enter from stage right . Henry welcomes them as they come inWelcome , Sir Thomas More ! Welcome , Bishop of Rochester ! Welcome , Prior John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but welcome ! THOMAS MORE It 's good of you to see us , Your Majesty . HENRY VIII Make it plural , More . Our Majesties are both seeing you . We have come from the coronation . THOMAS MORE It 's about that we wish to speak , my lord . But Bishop Fisher is the eldest and most learned among us . I ask him to speak first . BISHOP FISHER I have known you from a child , King Henry . I was present when you took your first three steps . You know I would not willingly say any word unpleasing to you . I have not opposed your divorce . I have not opposed your new marriage or the coronation of Queen Anne . Such things are sometimes necessary in the conduct of a state . But you also ask that every religious in England swear fealty to you as spiritual head of the church . And I can not accept your guidance in spiritual matters . p. 83 HENRY VIII But if I were not head of your church there could be no divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowned . Her child could not succeed me . BISHOP FISHER I know that . And still I can not accept you as my spiritual guide . HENRY VIII Do you accept the church of Rome ? BISHOP FISHER Yes . HENRY VIII Is the Pope moved by spiritual considerations ? BISHOP FISHER Your Majesty , I accept the spiritual authority of the church . I can not accept your usurpation of that authority . HENRY VIII Then  --  though I 'm very sorry to lose my friend  --  I 'm afraid you are guilty of treason and will die for it . BISHOP FISHER If it were only I , my king , it would n't matter . But there are thousands of my order and of similar orders who can not take this oath . Must they all die ? HENRY VIII If they wish to die , they may . If they insist , they will . And I 'll tell you why ! You have no right to question me , but I 'll answer ! I had no mind to cut adrift from Rome when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Rome  --  and now the cable 's cut , and we 're adrift unless we anchor to something ! Church and all , we 're adrift ! And I see no anchor but the king , and it happens I 'm the king ! John Houghton , why are you here ? p. 84 JOHN HOUGHTON I could sign everything that 's asked , Your Majesty , except the act that constitutes the king head of the church I serve . HENRY VIII You will sign it or die . JOHN HOUGHTON Then all my Charter House dies with me . HENRY VIII Have you not seen I have no alternative ? Rome denies my divorce . If I go and take it I deny Rome 's authority , and set up an authority of my own ! It 's Rome or the king ! I had to choose  --  and now you must ! Sir Thomas ? THOMAS MORE I have watched you govern for many years , King Henry . It 's a tyranny  --  and not a tyranny . HENRY VIII I thank you . THOMAS MORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjustly , illegally often , but your way is never to go beyond what the people 's will supports  --  or will support . You 're very shrewd in judging what you dare do . It 's as if you had an extra sense  --  the king 's finger  --  and you kept it on the pulse of your subjects  --  on your whole kingdom  --  and knew  --  before they knew  --  where they were going  --  and how far in the year . Only this time I do n't follow you at all . How can you hope your people will go with you when you rob their mother church , devour her children , slip your cuckoo eggs into the nest , and ask that we sit and say nothing 's happened ? p. 85 HENRY VIII You 're a great man , Sir Thomas More , but it may be there 's some truth in that about the king 's finger . They 'll go with me . The people will . THOMAS MORE Tell me why . HENRY VIII It 's  --  they do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll take me rather than some foreigner overseas . This was n't true ten years ago . It 's beginning to be true only now . This year . THOMAS MORE It may be true . I do n't know . I 've known these things to happen before with you . Not quite like this . Not on this scale . HENRY VIII It will happen . Must you still refuse to sign ? THOMAS MORE I must follow my own conscience . I have no king 's finger . I ca n't sign . BISHOP FISHER And I ca n't . JOHN HOUGHTON Nor I , my lord . HENRY VIII I 'm very sorry . THOMAS MORE We may go ? HENRY VIII Yes , gentlemen . You move away from this world ' of your own will . THOMAS MORE Your Majesty , it will go on without us . HENRY VIII No doubt of that . Farewell , then . Go with them , Norfolk . p. 86 DUKE OF NORFOLK Yes , Majesty . MORE , HOUGHTON , and FISHER bow and go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you help me up ? THOMAS CROMWELL Yes , sir . He helps Wolsey to his feet CARDINAL WOLSEY Good-by , Your Majesties . HENRY VIII Good-by , Wolsey . ANNE BOLEYN LowGood-by . CROMWELL helps WOLSEY out stage right HENRY VIII And that answers the last of them that dare speak . The rest will die silent . He turns to herAnne ? ANNE BOLEYN Yes . HENRY VIII Now I 've done all you asked of me. all you asked when we first danced together . And more . For you said nothing about a place of your own back there at our beginning . ANNE BOLEYN Yes . You 've done more . HENRY VIII I think there 's never been in all this world a king who gave so much to find his way to the heart of her he loved . Over many years , winter and summer , I have fought and chopped and hacked and stabbed my path through the jungle of laws and events and churchly rules  --  and the flesh of friends  --  to come to this day . To come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have earned her love . For all these days , Sweet , we have lain together , and kissed and drawn apart from the world into a world of our own , but not once , not once have you said , " I love you . " Surely now  --  surely my Nan will say it now ? p. 87 ANNE BOLEYN After a pause Yes , I do love you . HENRY VIII So . Then that 's not it . Not what I wanted . ANNE BOLEYN What did you want , my lord ? HENRY VIII Why  --  I do n't know . Only  --  I still do n't have you . You 're not mine . ANNE BOLEYN Is it something I could say ? HENRY VIII Why , yes , I think it is , if you wished to say it . But you do n't . Perhaps it 's better . Let it go . Let us look at the palace . ANNE BOLEYN Yes , let us look at York Place  --  and find your rooms for you . HENRY VIII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY VIII You 're sure ? ANNE BOLEYN Yes . HENRY VIII Nan ? ANNE BOLEYN My lord ? HENRY VIII Did someone say to you  --  sometime  --  " Never be all his , never melt to him  --  never forget to hate him at least a little  --  for that way you 'll lose him " ? ANNE BOLEYN I 've said it to myself . p. 88 HENRY VIII Do you say it now ? ANNE BOLEYN Yes . HENRY VIII I see . That 's what I feel . That you 're never mine . ANNE BOLEYN Is n't it better so ? HENRY VIII Because you might lose me ? No  --  do n't answer that . Let 's look at the rooms . ANNE BOLEYN Yes . HENRY VIII And yet. I think I 'm not as I was . I think I 've earned your heart  --  all your heart  --  over these years . Yet keep it if you wish . Only  --  Nan , Nan , last night while I lay thinking of you , and could n't sleep , and cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of a lyric , a little poem , and trying the music for it in my mind . It was a poem that grew from three words I heard once , from this same Sir Thomas More who must die , three words , " Always , never , sometimes . " I rose and wrote the poem down , and the music , and as I wrote I said to myself : " Do I mean what is said by this music , or by these words ? " And now I ask myself , " Do I mean them now ? " Here I stand , a king , with the woman I love , planning murder for her sake , planning to rob , lost in a copse of lies , sweating , falling over boulders , without a star . It 's a king 's life . A king lives so . Yet the music I wrote and remember says something simple &nbsp; &nbsp; and sweet and the words are undressed truth . Something within me drove me to write them out of the undergrowth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that way always . I have n't meant to do ill . I 've meant to do well . I have known that good was better than evil , when I 've known which was evil , which was good , but what test is there  --  what star , what beacon of fire ? Is it the church , held in thrall ? Is it the Christ ? Withdraw your guards , make no wars , strike no man down who strikes you , and how long will you be there , you or your nation ? I found it better to let all that go and write a lyric with music , writing to one I loved , a bitch who does not love me , but writing truly , thus , out of myself : Waking at night , I go to my window , &nbsp; &nbsp; Scanning the stars in a portion of sky , Fixing on one that hangs yonder  --  and over &nbsp; &nbsp; The street of the house where you lie . &nbsp; &nbsp; If you sleep , do you dream , &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clock strikes ; I hear your voice in the chimes , &nbsp; &nbsp; Repeating your words &nbsp; &nbsp; When I ask if you love me : &nbsp; &nbsp; " Always , never , sometimes . " p. 89 ANNE BOLEYN I did n't say it . HENRY VIII No , Sir Thomas More said it . But you might have . Writing 's like that . You never write down what happened . But what you write comes closer to what 's true than what did happen , or was said . ANNE BOLEYN I love you . HENRY VIII Nan ! ANNE BOLEYN I love you . Now I know . I love you . HENRY VIII I think you mean this . ANNE BOLEYN I 've said it , and it 's true . These men who were to die , Henry  --  Sir Thomas More and all the others  --  they must live . HENRY VIII That was all done for you , sweet . ANNE BOLEYN Yes , but we must let them live . HENRY VIII Our marriage may not be valid , nor my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they refuse to swear , and live  --  ANNE BOLEYN It does n't matter . It does n't matter about the divorce  --  or the marriage  --  or having this palace . Let them swear or not swear as they like . Let Katharine keep her throne , and Mary inherit . You love me , and I love you , and I can say it . HENRY VIII Why can you say it ? p. 90 ANNE BOLEYN Because of the poem  --  and the things you put in it  --  and the things you are  --  when we speak , and are close together . I 've been afraid to say it , afraid to be it , but now  --  Let it come , whatever it brings . I 'm deep in love . With one I hated . Who took me anyway . Took me from my first love . With you . HENRY VIII I thought you 'd never say it . Oh , if it 's true , and you 'll lie in my arms and love me , then I can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king I 've wished to be , just , generous , magnanimous to enemies , royal enough to treat all men royally , only I 'll need you to help me . ANNE BOLEYN If I can . HENRY VIII It 's not because of the palace ? Never a fair woman but loved silks and oriel windows and coronets . ANNE BOLEYN No , dear , it 's you , and hearing your thoughts , and being close to you , and thinking of the men that must not die . HENRY VIII Then it 's a new age . Gold or some choicer metal  --  or no metal at all , but exaltation , darling . Wildfire in the air , wildfire in the blood ! Have you room in your heart for much loving ? ANNE BOLEYN All you have . HENRY VIII For now you 'll have no rest . p. 91 ANNE BOLEYN I want none . Here . She opens her arms . He kisses her and they stand embraced HENRY VIII I was a pirate till I met you , Nan . No girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm yours . Is it some trick of the way you turn your eyes suddenly , and smile ? Sometimes I think it 's that . Is it the triangle of eyes and mouth , and the way they go together like no others ? Is it your lips ? Let me see . He kisses herNow I think it 's your lips . Or is it that little trill of speech you brought from France  --  hesitating over a word , and bewitching it with a laugh ? Is it your brows ? He kisses her browsIs it the delicacy of all you are , the flower face , and the minuscule breasts that I cup in my hands , and the tiny dancing feet like a figurine 's but tireless to dance with ? ANNE BOLEYN Never mind my size  --  I 've been teased about it . HENRY VIII There 's one way to decide  --  I 'll kiss you all , feet to crown  --  and it wo n't take long , it 's not far to go ! ANNE BOLEYN Not now . No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for whatever it was , I 'm happy  --  to have it as it pleases you . And , as for you , I know what it is about you . p. 92 HENRY VIII What about me ? ANNE BOLEYN There 's everything in you . Good and bad . There 's so much in you , you hardly know who you are . You 're a world . With one you 're a man about courts , a fantastic , with another you 're an authority on religion , monastic , grim , savage , learned , then again a pedant , running with ink , ink on your fingers , ink in your hair  --  if you cut yourself you bleed ink . With another a sportsman , talking shafts , or deer , or pheasants , or the habits of eels . Then you 're a lover of old manuscripts and libraries , an illuminator of Chaucer . Or a despot , or a king , a magnifico . Sometimes . Or a host , or a poet  --  or a merry guest , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil you can be ! You hardly know who you are . HENRY VIII I know with you ANNE BOLEYN But for all of these  --  I kiss you . For the devil , too . HENRY VIII Kiss me for all of them , for each one separately , and then again , twice as many , for myself . She kisses him , lips , eyes , and brow . CROMWELL returns , stage right THOMAS CROMWELL Forgive me , Your Majesty . HENRY VIII We 're reversing a policy , Cromwell . The oath to the Act of Succession is not required . Let them swear or not swear , as they please . p. 93 THOMAS CROMWELL But , Your Majesty  --  there are men sentenced  --  many  --  HENRY VIII Lift the sentences . Go now , and leave us alone . THOMAS CROMWELL Yes , Majesties . He goes , stage right HENRY VIII And now  --  it 's your palace . I have no place here till I 'm asked . ANNE BOLEYN Then I ask it . You wo n't need an apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yours . Or what I have . Put your arms round me . HENRY VIII Yes , sweet . He puts his arms round her ANNE BOLEYN I want to be yours only .

Elizabeth Boleyn , Madge Shelton , and Norfolk are in the room . Madge and Elizabeth bend over the child . ELIZABETH BOLEYN What beautiful little hands ! What a beautiful face !

ANNE BOLEYN No , Henry . I 'm glad to see you . HENRY comes into the room , staring at the child HENRY VIII I wo n't say much . Nor stay long .

HENRY VIII Whose  --  name ? ANNE BOLEYN We have a little daughter. and her name 's Elizabeth . p. 96 HENRY VIII A daughter ! Why did no one tell me ? DUKE OF NORFOLK They 're all afraid of you , my lord . I offered to go . What can he do to an old man , I said , beyond the usual disemboweling ? But they said no , wait .

I like her no less than I did  --  not a groat less . Get better , lass ; eat well and get on your legs quickly . We 'll have a good life , we 'll let this beauty grow a foot or two , and then we 'll have our son  --  and so nothing 's lost . Norfolk , I 'm off for the hunting . Come with me .

God keep all here  --  The lights go out p. 98 Act 2 , Scene 4 Act Two : SCENE 4 Shows Henry sitting as in the Prologue to the act , pen in hand . HENRY VIII There is a load every man lugs behind him , hevy , invisible , sealed , concealed , perfumed , a package of dead things he drags along , never opened save to put in some horror of the mind  --  some horror of his own doing  --  to seal up and rot in secret . He pretends there 's no such thing .  --  He tries to walk as if he had no burden . The stench is covered with purchased scents and flowers . The deeds in this bag , man and king , he utterly cancels , denies , forgets , for they would prove him an idiot , criminal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put them there . And they are mine . I did them , and put them there . All men have done the same  --  or done the like . And will.Have you done so much better , you out there in the future , you whom I see with the thousand eyes , looking back on my secret ways ? If you have , then you 're young and unlucky  --  it 's still to come . Or else you 're old and unlucky  --  it never was.With kings as with men there is the mask and tongue among your friends with a ready smile and word , and there is the hog behind the eyes , the rat behind the tongue , the dog that runs before and brings you after  --  or lags , and holds you back . And you obey them , the hog , the rat , the dog . Man , woman , and child , you have obeyed them always , and I have . The carrion and the beast decide where we shall love , and when leave off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our brain , but the vermin underneath , the unacknowledged boar , the hidden wallow , the invisible decay . Whatever she did , I had done first . For when I knew for the first time she was all mine , then , having loved her many years , suddenly I loved her only a little , and could look at others . And then I loved her not at all  --  And her lips were an over-eaten plate , and my body would not answer hers , and when I felt my child move beneath her skin I had no liking for it , and turned away . Was this her blame or mine ? Or was there blame ? p. 99 p. 100 Act 2 , Scene 5 Act Two : SCENE 5 A room in York place . The lights come up stage right to show Jane Seymour crocheting at a window . A SERVANT enters , bringing her a letter and a leather purse . JANE SEYMOUR Yes ? SERVANT It 's from the king , if it please you . Both these . JANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer . JANE SEYMOUR Is this a purse of gold ? SERVANT I think it is , mistress . JANE SEYMOUR I would not have the king think me ungrateful , but I have no need of gold , and no wish for it . And I think it would be better if I were not to know what is written here . She gives back letter and purse SERVANT Am I to tell him this ? JANE SEYMOUR If you will . The lights go out on the scene p. 101 Act 2 , Scene 6 Act Two : SCENE 6 The king 's hunting pavilion . A SERVANT is tieing a bracer on Henry 's arm . NORFOLK is reading to him out of a huge volume . HENRY VIII What does he say about the bracer ? DUKE OF NORFOLK " In a bracer a man must take heed of three things : that it have no nails in it , that it have no buckles , that it be laced without aiglettes . " HENRY VIII These three every fool knows . What else ? DUKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! NORFOLK starts to hand the book to a servantThrow it , I said ! Am I a king , or not a king ? DUKE OF NORFOLK How far am I to throw it , Your Grace ? My arm is not what it was . HENRY VIII Keep it . Here 's a glum bird that portends no good . CROMWELL enters from stage leftPortend , blackbird , portend . THOMAS CROMWELL I come to tell Your Majesty that you have perhaps left me in charge too long . The Commons and the Church are both out of hand . Nobody swears to the Act of Succession . It 's a matter of open debate whether Katharine or Anne is your queen , and whether Mary or Elizabeth shall succeed you . p. 102 HENRY VIII I intend to reign another forty years . And to have sons . And not by Katharine or Anne . Not by Katharine or Anne ! You hear ! Let them fight it out . THOMAS CROMWELL Queen Anne has sent Jane Seymour away from court . HENRY VIII Where ? THOMAS CROMWELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmed her ? THOMAS CROMWELL That I do n't know . But Jane was sent away , guarded . HENRY VIII I must go . He starts to walk away with the bracer still on his arm , carrying a bow SERVANT Your Majesty  --  shall I take this off ? HENRY VIII Aye  --  tear it off  --  cut it off ! He pauses , impatientNo , leave it ! I must go . He starts out , tossing the bow away , CROMWELL hurrying after him . The lights go out p. 103 Act 2 , Scene 7 Act Two : SCENE 7 The lights come up on full stage , showing the nursery of the child Elizabeth at York Palace . There is a crib and a chair or two . The rest is suggested by projections on the rear curtain . Elizabeth Boleyn and Henry Norris are at the cradle , watching the child .

HENRY NORRIS Whether to escape the singing or for delight in it , no man knows . p. 104 ANNE BOLEYN It was well sung . But you could keep the king of Spain 's daughter out of it , after this . I 've had enough trouble with the king of Spain 's daughter . MARK SMEATON Next time I will . NORFOLK appears at stage right DUKE OF NORFOLK The king 's here , my chicks .

I have especial cause at this moment not to offend them . ANNE BOLEYN Yes , I think so . HENRY VIII Where is Jane Seymour ? ANNE BOLEYN In Northumberland . And a very good place for her . HENRY VIII Her brothers have made it plain that they resent the slur you cast on her in sending her from court . p. 106 ANNE BOLEYN I do n't care for her . She has the face of a sheep . And the manners . But not the morals . I do n't want her near me . HENRY VIII You will bring her back . ANNE BOLEYN No , I think not . If you want her near you , why , find a suite for her in your own palace . This York place is mine . You gave it to me for my own . And while it 's mine , Jane Seymour must lie elsewhere . HENRY VIII Lassie  --  well  --  Speak to her , Norfolk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on slippery ground . More and more the common folk cry down your name . There used to be a penalty for speaking against you . There 's none now . And the people take advantage of it , in the church , in the government , wherever they meet . You have no defenders . ANNE BOLEYN Am I at the mercy of the people ? DUKE OF NORFOLK We 're all at the mercy of the people . Sooner or later , what they want they 'll have , unless you 're willing and able to do unlimited murder on them . ANNE BOLEYN I gave my voice for mercy . DUKE OF NORFOLK It happens you stand for something they do n't want . They 're for having the old queen back . p. 107 HENRY VIII Speak to her , Cromwell . THOMAS CROMWELL If things go as they 're going the Commons will revolt , Your Majesty . The divorce will be invalidated , and your marriage also . We 've slackened our hold , and the dogs are at our throats , yours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours ? THOMAS CROMWELL I 've worked hard at suppressing monasteries and squeezing money out of them . You  --  and the king 's love for you  --  have sliced off England from the mother church . We shall never be forgiven , you or I. Nor your child . She will not rule . Not as things go now . HENRY VIII And so , my dear , be a little less absolute in what you 'll have and not have . ANNE BOLEYN Jane Seymour will not couch here . HENRY VIII She will live here , among your women , and you 'll accept her . I 've sent for her to come . ANNE BOLEYN There are ways of making a woman so unwelcome. She pausesNo , she may come  --  and we 'll make her welcome . But More and Fisher and Houghton must not live , and all who refuse to sign the Act of Succession must die with them . Elizabeth must succeed you . See to that and Jane will be accepted here . We made this bargain before . And some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 108 HENRY VIII This part I ca n't keep . These men are my friends . ANNE BOLEYN By the year when I loved elsewhere , but must have you because you were the king  --  by the years when I loved no one but bore your weight because the earth was empty  --  by the year when I must carry your child without loving you , because you were royal  --  my child must be royal , too ! HENRY VIII Let me off from this , Nan . I ca n't kill these men . ANNE BOLEYN You 've killed before ! HENRY VIII One learns a little . Never since Buckingham have I touched a man in high place , one I respected , or whose death might become a symbol . If you love me , Nan , forget the succession . ANNE BOLEYN I love you now . I shall go to my grave loving you , no doubt , and hating you . But if you remember how it all came about , and how your word 's dishonored , how can you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HENRY VIII Because I can not look on these deaths . In all honesty ! Other deaths , but not these ! Could you sign these death warrants ? ANNE BOLEYN Oh , King of England , King of England , you blind king ! I 'd sign ten thousand to die rather than warm that white-faced serpent you love and disinherit my blood ! Henry stands silent before her , then speaks slowly p. 109 HENRY VIII It would need unlimited murder , as Norfolk said . Unlimited , pitiless murder . It would mean tearing the world apart ! Look at me , Nan  --  you know me  --  as I know myself . Is it fitting I should be head of a church ? It 's laughable  --  it ca n't be serious , and yet it is . If I impose myself there I 'm king and they dare not answer , and there I am  --  king and pope in one . To legalize a divorce , and a child , and a marriage ! ANNE BOLEYN Our dead marriage . But you will demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the church , stand by me as my husband , and father Elizabeth , the heir ! And if it costs heads and blood and fires at Smithfield let the blood run and the fires burn ! It 's that , or else it 's my blood , and Cromwell 's  --  and Elizabeth 's .

HENRY VIII What has the heart to do with the getting of kings ? I am not young  --  I am not true  --  I 'm bitter and expert and aging and venomous  --  not to be trusted . It 's your misfortune that you love me now that I no longer love you . Yet at this moment I want you  --  because of your anger and the flash of blood in your face  --  and , if you give me a prince , things may change  --  even I may change ! .

Even I. I loved you once . I saw that fire in your face . Give me a son . He takes her in his arms again . The lights go out . After a moment three violins are heard playing the air of a song somewhere in the darkness p. 112 Act 2 , Scene 8 Act Two : SCENE 8 King Henry is sitting in his closet at window , writing and humming the song to himself as he writes it down . CROMWELL enters . HENRY VIII You 're late , sir  --  and we have much to do . THOMAS CROMWELL I have ill news . HENRY VIII What news ? THOMAS CROMWELL The queen is brought to bed of a son , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . THOMAS CROMWELL Yes . HENRY VIII I do n't trust you in this . THOMAS CROMWELL I did n't trust anyone else .

Born  --  and a son  --  but cursed with the curse of God because I 've had her sister  --  or because. well , for whatever reason , it was dead . Oh , my God , help me ! What do you want of me ? Was this girl not to your mind ? Not ever ? Or am I not to your mind ? But I am the king , God 's chosen , potent and virile . I am a man . The woman 's failed me . I must look elsewhere . The lights fade . The music of the song plays again p. 113 p. 114 Act 2 , Scene 9 Act Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at the table , stage left . The three singers stand before him . HENRY VIII Sing the song tenderly  --  no , you 're young , you would n't know about tenderness . Sing it lightly , softly , to the lady who sits reading . The lights come up on Jane Seymour , who sits with a book in hand . The SINGERS go toward her JANE SEYMOUR Yes ? HENRY VIII They are about to sing to you , Jane . JANE SEYMOUR I thank Your Majesty . SINGERS Waking at night , I go to my window , Scanning the stars in a portion of sky , Fixing on one that hangs yonder  --  and overThe street of the house where you lie . ANNE BOLEYN enters , unseen by the others , and listensIf you sleep , do you dream , If you dream , is it of me ? The clock strikes ; I hear your voice in the chimes , Repeating your wordsWhen I ask if you love me : " Always , never , sometimes .

ANNE BOLEYN Play out your play . ( She goes out ) HENRY VIII Sing the song again . ( As the song begins the lights go out ) @x Anne Boleyn is seen sitting in her cell in the fur-trimmed gown , as at the beginning of the play . She has her tablet and stylus and begins to write . ANNE BOLEYN From the day he first made me his , to the last day I made him mine , yes , let me set it down in numbers , I who can count and reckon , and have the time . Of all the days I was his and did not love him  --  this ; and this ; and this many . Of all the days I was his  --  and he had ceased to love me  --  this many ; and this . In days . She writesIt comes to a thousand days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand . And of that thousand  --  one  --  when we were both in love .

And the son we had  --  the one son  --  born of our hate and lust  --  died in my womb . When Henry was hurt at the jousting . Then Henry looked in my face and said , " This marriage is cursed like the other . I 've known it all along . There 's a curse on it . " And he turned and left me . Have you no hate in your heart , Anne ? You had hate enough when you were young ! Hate him now , and curse him , and it wo n't matter what he does  --  or has done ! I ca n't hate him .

The lights dim , remaining on Anne 's face , then coming up on stage left p. 117 @x The little , barred window has disappeared and instead we are in the castle at York . At stage left Norris , Smeaton , and Madge Shelton are seated at a card table . Anne is at the cradle , stage right , bending over it to sing a lullaby . ANNE BOLEYN Sleep , little coddling , Sleep , sleep warm , Your mother 's in a taking , There will be a storm . Sleep , little hatchling , Sleep , little squirrel , Your father 's losing money , There will be a quarrel . MADGE SHELTON Can you pick up your cards , Nan ? ANNE BOLEYN Play for me , will you , Madge ? Never mind , I can leave her . She rises and goes to the card table . NORFOLK comes in from stage left , followed by CROMWELLWe have visitors . We are honored , gentlemen , but why were you not announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROMWELL Yes , I know the names . DUKE OF NORFOLK I have a warrant for your arrest , niece . I could have let others bring it , but I thought I could do it more gently than some . p. 119 ANNE BOLEYN What am I to be arrested for ? DUKE OF NORFOLK Also any gentlemen found in your chamber are to be taken with you . ANNE BOLEYN But  --  why ? What for ? I am the queen . DUKE OF NORFOLK Embarrassed , looking at a paperFor  --  it says for adultery . With these  --  and three others . ANNE BOLEYN But  --  this is  --  DUKE OF NORFOLK Niece , it 's pure nonsense . But here it is . THOMAS CROMWELL You will take a few things and come . ANNE BOLEYN But the child ? THOMAS CROMWELL You will leave her with your women . ANNE BOLEYN Then  --  what women may I take with me ? THOMAS CROMWELL You will be furnished with attendants at the Tower . MARK SMEATON We go to the Tower , too ? THOMAS CROMWELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come up on Henry , sitting at his table as in Act Two p. 120 Act 3 , Scene 2 Act Three : SCENE 2 CROMWELL comes in and bows to Henry . HENRY VIII What have you done ? THOMAS CROMWELL She 's safe in a room without windows . HENRY VIII We ca n't keep her there . We have no evidence . There 's no precedent for the trial of a queen . THOMAS CROMWELL No evidence ? Smeaton admits adultery with her . HENRY VIII What ? He leaps to his feetSmeaton ! THOMAS CROMWELL And there will be others . HENRY VIII Where is Smeaton ? THOMAS CROMWELL In the Tower . HENRY VIII He 's been tortured ? THOMAS CROMWELL Would that impugn his evidence ? HENRY VIII I 've sometimes wondered . THOMAS CROMWELL There will be others . HENRY VIII I want to be just . I must be just in this . Smeaton ! Tell me . Is this true ? THOMAS CROMWELL The truth is what the judges will find , what the king will decide . p. 121 HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day ! What I want to know is , did this happen ? THOMAS CROMWELL He confesses it . HENRY VIII Under what torture ? THOMAS CROMWELL Only a rope around his brows . No more . HENRY VIII God knows she could . Any woman could . And I 've given her cause . But you have reasons for wishing her guilty , you know ! You 're not an impartial judge . You need a scapegoat to blame for the robbery of the church ! THOMAS CROMWELL My lord  --  HENRY VIII And I need a scapegoat ! I 'm no impartial judge ! I 'd want to find her guilty , and you know that , you play on that ! THOMAS CROMWELL My lord , if you wish to accuse me  --  HENRY VIII I accuse both of us ! I want to marry elsewhere ! There was a time when getting rid of Anne would n't have helped . I 'd have had Katharine round my neck again . But now Katharine 's dead . And if Anne were dead I 'd be free ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me ! Liar , butcher , sewer rat ! And yet she may truly be guilty . THOMAS CROMWELL So Smeaton says . HENRY VIII After a pauseLet her be tried . Let Norfolk sit over her as judge . Let her own uncle be the judge . Let her be tried by a group of peers . And if she speaks in her defense I wish it to be where I may hear her speak  --  without being seen . p. 122 THOMAS CROMWELL Yes , my lord . The lights go out on Henry and Cromwell , come up on. p. 123 Act 3 , Scene 3 Act Three : SCENE 3 Anne at her cell window . After a moment we see that there are three men standing before her : Norfolk , Cromwell , and Kingston , the keeper of the Tower . DUKE OF NORFOLK I 'd have preferred to see you alone , Anne , that 's true , but there are reasons why I could n't . ANNE BOLEYN You may send the others out , I think . DUKE OF NORFOLK The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go because he has orders that nobody 's to see you alone . Cromwell wo n't go because he does n't want anything said to you  --  or by you  --  that he does n't hear . And I do n't dare to be alone with you here , because I 'm your judge , and it would be thought I was in collusion with you . ANNE BOLEYN I 'm glad to see you even on these terms , Uncle Norfolk . I 've had little company . I 'd ask you to sit , but my cell 's poorly furnished . DUKE OF NORFOLK Thank you , we do nicely . ANNE BOLEYN I could have some chairs , perhaps ? KINGSTON I 'm sorry , Your Majesty . ANNE BOLEYN No ? She smilesWell , it 's you who stand , not I. p. 124 DUKE OF NORFOLK What I came to ask is whether I can help you in any way . ANNE BOLEYN Would you ? DUKE OF NORFOLK If I can . ANNE BOLEYN There are three things I 've wanted very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a few minutes every day . I get such a longing to see the sky . And. DUKE OF NORFOLK Yes ? ANNE BOLEYN I 'd like to see one or two friends  --  only one or two  --  if they could come here . Somebody could be with us  --  but I 'd like to see them . DUKE OF NORFOLK Yes . ANNE BOLEYN And my Elizabeth . Could n't she visit me  --  or even stay here ? She 'd be company for me  --  she 's three now  --  and the days are so horribly long . DUKE OF NORFOLK Kingston ? KINGSTON These things have all been thought of , my lord . ANNE BOLEYN Oh ? KINGSTON And all forbidden . ANNE BOLEYN By whom ? KINGSTON By him who thinks of everything . ANNE BOLEYN By Henry ? Kingston does n't answerBy the king ? p. 125 DUKE OF NORFOLK After a pauseHe is not allowed to answer , my dear . ANNE BOLEYN Yes . By Henry . I understand . But why it 's all taken so seriously and black-browed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually believe that I 'm guilty . Or actually find me guilty . DUKE OF NORFOLK My dear , do you think you could bring yourself to live quietly somewhere  --  out of the kingdom  --  such a place as Antwerp  --  and not claim your rights here further ? ANNE BOLEYN I could be quiet , I 'd be glad to be quiet . You 're offering me something . If I resign my queenship  --  and the succession ? DUKE OF NORFOLK Suppose you made it easy  --  to annul your marriage ? Could you do that ? ANNE BOLEYN What would it mean for Elizabeth ? DUKE OF NORFOLK She 'd go to Antwerp with you . ANNE BOLEYN And it would go back to what Henry wanted in the first place . I 'd be a mistress  --  a discarded mistress with an unfathered child . No . I 'd have to refuse that . DUKE OF NORFOLK But  --  if you do  --  wo n't the peers have to find you guilty , Anne ? ANNE BOLEYN Even though I 'm not ? He is silentAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice . I must impose a sentence commensurate with the guilt they find . ANNE BOLEYN I 'd have to die then ? He is silentBy the headsman ? He is still silentI ca n't believe it . DUKE OF NORFOLK It 's not certain , of course . I 'm not sure . Speak well at your trial , girl . You can do it , none better . None as well . Make them listen . That way there may be hope . The lights dim ANNE BOLEYN At my trial ? DUKE OF NORFOLK Yes . Make it difficult for him . Speak  --  as if he were there . The lights go out . The little barred window appears , then Anne , She is alone in her cell p. 127 Act 3 , Scene 4 Act Three : SCENE 4 The lights come up on Norfolk seated as a judge at stage left , a clerk below him writing the proceedings of the trial . He writes in a large book that lies on his knees , using an inkhorn that sits on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing , acts as prosecutor . A group of peers are faintly seen above and behind Norfolk . THOMAS CROMWELL I ask you this question for the last time , Henry Norris , and I warn you that there is mercy in this court only for those who tell truth . What were your relations with the queen ? HENRY NORRIS Speaking truly , Master Cromwell , I can say only what I have said before  --  that I have always honored Her Majesty , Queen Anne , for her wit and presence and her conduct of the court , and also for her known and unquestioned virtue . Whoever has slandered her enough to say that there was ever a breath of wrong between her and me  --  he lies , no matter who he is , or where . As Norris speaks we see Anne seated listening as the defendant in the trial . Then , on the opposite side of the stage , we see that a curtain , or arras , is hung along the wall , and that King Henry sits concealed behind it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , sir . You will find it useless to deny it . p. 128 HENRY NORRIS You have brought no witnesses against me . I am unjustly accused in this star chamber and quite guiltless  --  and I believe the queen to be quite as guiltless as I am . THOMAS CROMWELL Remove Henry Norris and bring Mark Smeaton in again . A BAILIFF comes forward to lead Norris out HENRY NORRIS Lord Norfolk , this is no just procedure ! Do you continue to lend it your countenance ? DUKE OF NORFOLK Every man to his own conscience , lad . HENRY NORRIS God keep me from yours ! DUKE OF NORFOLK That he will do . HENRY NORRIS The one witness the prosecution has found is a loose-mouthed woman of sinister reputation ! The queen has denied her guilt ! The five men accused with her deny their guilt and hers  --  in spite of torture , bribes , and promises of acquittal ! HENRY rises in his place , uneasy DUKE OF NORFOLK Let us proceed with the case . The next witness . NORRIS is led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broken . The mark of a rope appears on his forehead . He sits and looks down p. 129 THOMAS CROMWELL Swear him . A BAILIFF takes a Bible to Smeaton , lays his hand on it . HENRY sits BAILIFF Do you swear to tell the truth at this trial ? MARK SMEATON Yes . The BAILIFF takes the Bible away THOMAS CROMWELL Again I warn you , Mark Smeaton , that there will be mercy only for those who tell truth . What were your relations with the woman who sits here , the former Queen Anne ? MARK SMEATON My lord , I have told only the truth . So far as I know she is innocent . I am innocent . THOMAS CROMWELL Do you wish to spend another half hour with the executioner ? MARK SMEATON No . THOMAS CROMWELL Then truthfully . Did you have carnal relations with Queen Anne ? MARK SMEATON My lord , you do n't want the truth  --  THOMAS CROMWELL Did you have carnal relations with Queen Anne ? And this time have a care of yourself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMEATON Looking desperately round the court , then again at the floorYes. p. 130 THOMAS CROMWELL Did you answer yes ? MARK SMEATON LowYes . THOMAS CROMWELL He confesses it . To the clerkBe sure this is written To SmeatonYou had relations with the queen at sundry times and places ? MARK SMEATON Yes . THOMAS CROMWELL Why , now you begin to talk like a man . Now we begin to think well of you , and you shall be treated like a man . Take him to his cell and let him rest . Let us have Norris again ! ANNE BOLEYN To NorfolkMy lord ! My lord of Norfolk ! DUKE OF NORFOLK Yes , Lady Anne . ANNE BOLEYN May I question this man  --  Mark Smeaton ? DUKE OF NORFOLK Why do you wish to question him ? ANNE BOLEYN You know this is not a trial , Uncle Norfolk ! It 's like an evil dream , with no witnesses , no defense for the accused , no sifting of evidence , no waft of air from outside , and yet I 'm being tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried ! Since no man speaks for me or examines for me , let me speak and examine for myself ! p. 131 THOMAS CROMWELL Take him to his cell . DUKE OF NORFOLK Lord Cromwell examines for you . ANNE BOLEYN He ! He brought me here ! He is my accuser ! DUKE OF NORFOLK Why , let her question Mark Smeaton . SMEATON is brought back ANNE BOLEYN Thank you , my lord . Mark , look at me . He looks at her , then away I know well you 've been tortured , but you know it 's not true  --  what you 've said about you and me . Why do you say it ? MARK SMEATON LowIt is true . THOMAS CROMWELL To the clerkWrite that . He says it is true . ANNE BOLEYN Mark , you poor lad , I 've been at the other end of the process , and I know the wiles they use on the rats and rabbits they catch in their trap . I know why you 've changed your mind and say now that I 'm guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it . But they wo n't keep their word , Mark . After you 've testified they 'll find you guilty and worthy of death . Smeaton is silent THOMAS CROMWELL He 's said it three times now . We have our evidence . p. 132 ANNE BOLEYN Is n't it better , if we 're to die , that we die with the truth on our lips ? You ca n't save me or save yourself , but you will save something if you refuse to utter a falsehood with the last breath you have . It 's a pernicious falsehood , and its influence will go on forever . It 's the word you will be remembered for . MARK SMEATON DesperateIt 's not a falsehood ! It 's true ! I 'm guilty ! I was guilty with the queen ! Let me go ! Let me go ! I was guilty ! The queen was guilty ! Let me go free ! THOMAS CROMWELL Take him to his cell . ANNE BOLEYN Who do you say it for , Mark ? For Cromwell , here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uncounted monks and men  --  and seen them hastily buried . It 's his trade . He 's done it for me  --  to my shame ! MARK SMEATON She came to my bed ! I swear it ! ANNE BOLEYN Mark , Mark ! THOMAS CROMWELL Take him out ! The BAILIFF leads MARK SMEATON toward the exit , but before they can go HENRY has risen in his chair suddenly , tipping it over backward , and making enough noise to startle the court . He strides into the scene , his eyes on Smeaton p. 133 ANNE BOLEYN Ah ! He who sees everything , who knows everything ! The king ! At his entrance , though he takes no note of them , the peers all rise and bow . CROMWELL bows HENRY VIII To SmeatonGive your testimony again ! You say the queen came to your bed . When ? How many times ? MARK SMEATON Not looking upMany times . HENRY VIII When was this ? MARK SMEATON I do n't remember . HENRY VIII You will remember ! Call it to mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jog your memory ! When did this happen ? Where ? MARK SMEATON At York place . HENRY VIII You lie . It could never have happened at York place  --  for you slept in a room with two others ! MARK SMEATON No , no , it was at Windsor ! HENRY VIII Fool ! She went to Windsor only with me . Can you find no better lie ! MARK SMEATON It was many places ! She came to my bed ! It was wherever you like , whenever you like ! Oh , God help me , let me go ! Let me go free ! I 'll say whatever you like ! p. 134 HENRY VIII Did Cromwell promise you your life if you said this ? THOMAS CROMWELL My lord ! HENRY VIII Knocking pen and book from the clerk 's handCease this penscratching ! Answer me ! Did he say you would live ? MARK SMEATON Yes . HENRY VIII He lied to you . You 're to die , musician . Say what you like you 're to die ! Speak now without lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I to die ? HENRY VIII You 're to die in any case , whatever 's said from here on . And now that you know that , what happened between you and the queen ? MARK SMEATON Coming to himselfBetween the queen and me ? Nothing . She was kind and pleasant and just . I would n't hurt her . But they 've broken me with ropes and irons  --  and wooden wedges . HENRY VIII Take him out . A BAILIFF leads SMEATON outAnd yet it could be true . To AnneYou were no virgin when I met you first . You told me as much . You knew what it was to have men . ANNE BOLEYN Have you stepped into your own trap , my lord ? Any evidence you have against me you yourself bought and paid for . Do you now begin to believe it ? p. 135 HENRY VIII Looks at her steadily for a moment , then turnsI was a fool to come here ! ANNE BOLEYN Why did you come ? HENRY VIII Because I wanted to know ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know ! And no man ever knows ! ANNE BOLEYN Whether I was unfaithful to you ? HENRY VIII Yes ! Just that ! Whether you were unfaithful to me while I loved you ! But I 'll never know ! Whether you say aye or no I wo n't be sure either way ! Fool that I am ! That all men are ! ANNE BOLEYN There are fools and fools , King Henry . Do you have a moment to hear my side of it ? HENRY VIII No . ANNE BOLEYN Go then . But when you speak of fools  --  you 've shut me up here to be tried for adultery and treason toward you . I 'm tried as if in a coffin  --  and those with me  --  in a coffin  --  the lid closed  --  no evidence  --  no voice  --  no air to breathe  --  no cell mates for us but torture  --  or lies  --  or false promises . You 've done this because you love elsewhere  --  you want to forget me utterly , go on , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only a death  --  not like that dreadful years-long tug of worlds you had to go through with Katharine . So you do this  --  and I know it  --  but now you come here to make sure whether there were truly adultery , because that would touch your manhood  --  or your pride ! And you sit and listen , a cat in a corner , watching the pet mouse run before it dies . And then you come out  --  to make sure ! And , oh fool of fools , even so , my heart and my eyes are glad of you ! Fool of all women that I am , I 'm glad of you here ! Go , then . Keep your pride of manhood . You know about me now . p. 136 HENRY VIII Nan  --  ANNE BOLEYN Mind , I ask no pity of you  --  for I 'm as proud as you  --  though my heart has played me this trick  --  and puts me here and you there  --  but I would like to ask you , what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like painted figures , saying nothing , and the judge fears the prosecutor , and the truth is n't wanted ? Are you so afraid of me ? Am I such a danger ? HENRY VIII This court was set up for a purpose . You know that . You 've seen such courts . ANNE BOLEYN Yes . HENRY VIII You were given a choice . ANNE BOLEYN When ? HENRY VIII A man you know came offering you a choice . I think you recall it . ANNE BOLEYN There was some suggestion the marriage could be nullified . I said no to that . The suggestion came from you ? HENRY VIII It came from me . ANNE BOLEYN I 'd have to say no again . HENRY VIII But think still once more about it , Nan . I have no wish to harm you . I am much moved by what you said . I 'd rather a year cut out of my life than do you wrong . After those words of yours . Did you say  --  Did you say truly , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't say it again . But I did say it . And it was true . HENRY VIII Then , let 's do this all gently , Nan , for old times ' sake . I have to prove that I can father a king to follow me . That was why I left Katharine  --  why I turned to you . It 's why I must leave you now and turn to someone else , but it can be done all simply and gently , without this court or the headsman . ANNE BOLEYN How ? HENRY VIII If I 'm to marry again you must somehow free me . Divorce wo n't do , because that would leave Elizabeth the heir . Nullification of our marriage  --  that  --  if you would agree to it , and sign away all rights , and live at some distance  --  that would do it . ANNE BOLEYN Why must you leave a king to follow you , Henry ? Why not a queen ? HENRY VIII This country 's never been ruled by a queen . I doubt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a son now . God has spoken there . I must have my king 's sons elsewhere . And it grows late . I 'm not young as I was . ANNE BOLEYN And what do you want of me ? HENRY VIII Go quietly . Sign the nullification . Live abroad with Elizabeth . You 'll be cared for . Leave me free . p. 138 ANNE BOLEYN No . Once we danced together , and I told you any children we had would be bastards . You promised me to change that  --  now you dance out of your promise and reduce to bastards again . Well , I wo n't do it . We were king and queen , man and wife together . I keep that . Take it from me as best you can . HENRY VIII You do leave no choice . ANNE BOLEYN Would you let this grind on the way it 's going ? HENRY VIII You would , if it served your purpose . ANNE BOLEYN I ? HENRY VIII I remember your saying , " Let them die , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . ANNE BOLEYN No , I did say it . These things look different from the other end . If I 'd known then what I feel now  --  I could n't have done it . HENRY VIII No . ANNE BOLEYN I 've been your wife . Could you do it to me ? HENRY VIII Yes . If you stood in my way . Defiantly . As you do . ANNE BOLEYN You 're not old . You 've been long a king . But you 're still young and could change . You said  --  on that one day when we loved each other  --  you remember  --  that one day when I loved you and you loved me  --  that you would change  --  would seek justice  --  would be such a king as men had hoped you 'd be when you came to the throne ? It 's not too late for that . Only if you harden in your mind toward me , and say , it 's nothing , like the other rats and rabbits let her be cut and torn and buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The king  --  the great king you might have been , will have died in you . p. 139 HENRY VIII Now I 'll tell you truly . I do want to begin again . And I ca n't with you . You brought me into blood  --  that bloody business of the death of More and all the pitiful folk who were like him and would n't sign . Your hand was to that . It 's bloodstained . ANNE BOLEYN And yours ? Not yours ? Will you give back what you stole from the monasteries , and the men executed ? Will you resume with Rome ? When you do that I 'll take your word again . But you wo n't do it . And what you truly want  --  you may not know it  --  is a fresh , frail , innocent maid who 'll make you feel fresh and innocent again , and young again . Jane Seymour is the name . It could be anyone . Only virginal and sweet . And when you 've had her you 'll want someone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get her , You 'll murder if you must . HENRY VIII AngryWhy , then you 've decided . And so have I. Norfolk ! He starts away ANNE BOLEYN Flashing outBefore you go , perhaps You should hear one thing  --  I lied to you . I loved you , but I lied to you ! I was untrue ! Untrue with many ! HENRY VIII This is a lie . p. 140 ANNE BOLEYN Is it ? Take it to your grave ! Believe it ! I was untrue ! HENRY VIII Why , then , it 's settled . You asked for it . You shall have it . ANNE BOLEYN Quite correct . Only what I take to my grave you take to yours ! With many ! Not with one ! Many ! HENRY VIII To NorfolkShe 's guilty ! She dies ! Proceed with this mummery . He turns DUKE OF NORFOLK May we have your signature , my lord ? HENRY VIII Lend me your pen . He takes the clerk 's pen from his hand , pulls a paper from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all those present save Henry and AnneShe lies , she lies . She was not unfaithful to me . And yet  --  if she were  --  She could  --  any woman could  --  and yet she lies If she lies , let her die for lying ! Let her die . He writesOh God , oh God , sometimes I seem to sit in a motionless dream , and watch while I do a horrible thing and know that I do it , and all the clocks in all the world stand still  --  waiting . What is she thinking in this halted interval while no mote falls through the shaft of sunlight and no man takes a breath ? ANNE BOLEYN To herself , as the lights dim on HenryI 've never thought what it was like to die . To become meat that rots . Then food for shrubs , and the long roots of vines . The grape could reach me . I may make him drunk before many years . Someone told me the story of the homely daughter of Sir Thomas More climbing at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father 's head on a spike  --  and climbing down with it , and taking it home . To bury in the garden perhaps . Even so , it was death . And I ordered it . And Bishop Fisher , the old frail man . And Houghton . And the thousands . They lie there now . And the roots find them .  --  That was my dream ! I remember  --  poor homely Margaret climbing into the darkness above the bridge and hunting among the stinking and bloody heads of criminals , till she found her father 's head , and pulling it from the spike , holding on with one hand , crying , almost falling , his beard matted and hard with blood . Then she must clasp the horrible thing against her breast , and climb down in the dark , holding by one hand , slipping , near falling , unable to see for tears . " Where is your father 's head ? " they asked her . " In earth , " she said proudly . " How far do you pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't found it , still. Would they fix my head up on London Bridge ? No . Even Henry would object to that . I 've been his queen . He 's kissed my lips . He would n't want it . I 'll lie in lead  --  or brass . Meat . Dead meat . But if my head were on the bridge he would n't climb to take it down . Nobody 'd climb for me . I could stay and face up the river , and my long hair blow out and tangle round the spikes  --  and my small neck . Till the sea birds took me , and there was nothing but a wisp of hair and a cup of bone . Sir Thomas More made a jest before he died . He spoke to the headsman at the foot of the scaffold  --  " Friend , " he said , " if you 'll help me to get up , I 'll see to the coming down . " I must think of something to say when the time comes . If I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could I do it ? Could I lay my head down  --  and smile , and speak ? Till the blow comes ?

I wonder what will come of my little girl when she must go on alone . p. 141 HENRY VIII Rising , the paper in his handsShall I tear this ? ANNE BOLEYN No . Go your way , and I 'll go mine . You to your death , and I to my expiation . For there is such a thing as expiation . It involves dying to live . HENRY VIII Death is a thing the coroner can see . I 'll stick by that . ANNE BOLEYN A coroner would n't know you died young , Henry . And yet you did . HENRY VIII Turning awayBurn these records ! He kicks the clerk 's book , which lies on the floor , and goes out . The lights go out on the scene p. 142 Act 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on Henry , who sits writing in his accustomed place . There are papers before him , and a number of pens , also an inkhorn . A penknife lies with the pens . HENRY VIII I 've worked all night . There 's light in the window . They say you need less sleep as you grow older . Or more . One or the other . This night I 've had none . He puts out a handYet my hand 's steady as a tree . And the writing 's firm as a boy 's . This is the morning she 's to die . I 'd almost forgotten . That would have shaken me , ten years ago . Not now . He lays the quill down I need a new pen . He takes up the penknife and begins to cut a new quill with practiced hand . The boom of a single cannon is heardNan is dead . Well , so much for Nan . That 's over . He pares tranquilly at the quill .

Wherever you go they 'll follow after you now . Her perfume will linger in every room you enter , and the stench of her death will drive it out. Get on with your work . He sits , wraps a kerchief about his hand , dips the new pen , and writesThese are not empty things you do . As he bends over his table Anne is seen standing opposite him . Her hair is piled on top of her head , and the fur collar turned down . There is a ring of blood about her neck.HENRY looks upIt 's Nan . No doubt I 'll sometimes see you when I 'm alone .
