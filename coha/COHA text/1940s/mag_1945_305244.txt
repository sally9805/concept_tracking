A concerted religious crusade was under way . Protestant , Catholic and Jewish forces last week had a common aim : to get at least one foot inside the forthcoming United Nations Conference in San Francisco . They were determined to let the peacemakers know that the churches want a peace based on human rights . <P> The religious forces were using up-to-date techniques to win public support . The Federal Council of Churches , the Synagogue Council of America and other groups endorsed Dumbarton Oaks Week ( April 16-22 ) and called for nationwide Days of Prayer on Sunday , April 22 and the opening day of the conference ( April 25 ) . To keep delegates reminded of their watchfulness , the churches will light the huge ( 103 ft. ) cross atop San Francisco 's Mt . Davidson every night for at least the first week of the conference , will keep prominent churchmen in the galleries as conference observers , will fill the exhibit spaces with peace plans of all faiths. * <P> If the churches make a dent on San Francisco , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unaccustomed realism . Last week John Foster Dulles , spokesman for the Protestant crusaders , summed up their view : " This time it is of the utmost importance that we be realistic . We must see the Dumbarton Oaks proposals for what they are-a good start . . . . San Francisco must be looked to not as a stopping point but as a starting point . " <P> And in churches and bedrooms through out the U.S. , many an old-fashioned Christian was using a more traditional , less high-pressure method : praying on his knees . <P> <P> * Examples : nine amendments to Dumbarton Oaks , recommended by the Protestants ( TIME , Jan. 29 ) , which would fit world security plans to Christian ideals ; the " Pattern for Peace " signed by 146 top-ranking Protestants , Catholics and Jews , calling for a moral world order backed by " adequate sanctions " to keep the peace ,
