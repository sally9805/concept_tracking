In baseball parks from Seattle to San Diego , the turnstiles were spinning . With 34% more population to draw on than before the war , attendance in the bustling Pacific Coast League was running well ahead of last year ( 1946 's record total : 3,718,716 ) . But was this proof that the P.C.L . had outgrown its minor-league uniforms ? All sport attendance figures were in the clouds-and there was no denying that it took a pretty big customer to fill a major-league suit . <P> Even so , West Coast baseball men insisted , they were sick &; tired of serving as blood donors to the big leagues . As fast as the P.C.L . produced its DiMaggios and Williamses , the majors got them . At least , something could be done about that , could n't it ? <P> To the men who run the tightly knit U.S. baseball empire , such squawks and promotions by the Pacific powers are old stuff . Yet last week , to the amazement of many , the lords &; masters made a pacifying pilgrimage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the westward junket ; he was accompanied by Presidents Will Harridge and Ford Frick of the American and National Leagues . At Los Angeles the battle was joined . Loudly led by dapper President Clarence ( " Pants " ) <P> Rowland , an ex-bartender and ex-umpire , the PCLers renewed their lobbying for promotion to major status . <P> Draft Dodgers . In the diamond hierarchy , the P.C.L . has an unusual status . The 16 major-league clubs own or control 70% of the nation 's 326 clubs in organized baseball . But the AAA coast league is 87% independent ( the one exception is Phil Wrigley 's Los Angeles Angels ) . Still , the majors have kept a tight hold on the P.C.L . through the draft law , which forces the clubs to sell their stars or risk having them drafted at season 's end for a niggling $10,000 . <P> To Pants Rowland , the best way to get out from under the hated draft would be to make the P.C.L . a third big league . The obvious argument : such cities as Sacramento @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the population or the parks to make the grade . ( West Coasters point out that the St. Louis Browns have played to crowds as small as 478 . ) Last week Babe Ruth dropped into Los Angeles , threw more cold water on the western dream : " There are n't even enough top baseball players for two major leagues . " <P> Mail Service . A short cut-which makes the P.C.L . shiver-is the possibility of moving one or more big-league franchises into Los Angeles or San Francisco , or both . Air travel would certainly enable Eastern teams to keep up with their schedules . <P> Leonard Roach , a Los Angeles County supervisor , has been touting his county 's vast ( 105,000-seat ) Coliseum as a big-league park . But he has neglected to point out that the right-field seats would be only 290 feet away from the plate , and balls hit to left field would have to be mailed in . Also , parking space is precious , some lots charging up to $5 a car . And concessions in the Coliseum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> On the other hand , the San Francisco
