TAKE a good look at the front cover of this issue of your Popular Science Monthly . You are looking at something you have never seen before ? a picture that was transmitted by radio in one operation and imprinted on a sheet of ordinary paper . This is known as color facsimile . It is the product of years of effort to transmit  | an image by wire or radio and reproduce it perfectly on ordinary paper at the receiving point . It was developed by Finch Telecommunications , Inc. , of Passaic , N. J. Finch labels it " Colorfax . " The first Colorfax machine was built by Dr. LaVerne R. Philpott in his home workshop with " a drill press , a lathe and a couple of screwdrivers . " It was demonstrated this fall in the ' WGHF studio in New York , and a commercial model , which will plug into any FM radio and will retail for about $150 , is being designed now . As a communications device , Colorfax opens up a whole new world to the home owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be done with it : You can listen to a radio lecture on any subject under the sun and look at illustrations accompanying the lecture as they roll out of the facsimile machine -- in color . If the lecture is on atomic energy , you can support your understanding of what you hear with colored charts . If it 's on automobile repair , you can look at the part under repair in color . Afterward , if you want to , you can tack the picture up in the garage . That distinguishes facsimile from television . Television transmits a fleeting record , facsimile a permanent one . Sunday morning 's comics ? in color -- can be delivered to your children right in your own home by radio , along with news for the grownups that is " printed " as it is on a newspaper page . Facsimile puts a genie in any man 's house , answerable to command . If the whim strikes you , you can squirt the incoming pictures or news onto a wire recording tape or an ordinary phonograph record and then " print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible because the radioed impulses causing the facsimile receiver to work can be converted into either sound or something to look at . The sound is n't musical . It 's like a mouse 's squeak intermittently interrupted by a scratching noise . Facsimile is not new . Color facsimile is brand new . Good black-and-white facsimile  | was made possible more than a decade ago when a means was found for converting the tone gradations on a photograph or a printed page into impulses that could be sent by wire or wireless , and then be reconverted on photosensitive or electrosensitive paper into a duplicate of the original . Facsimile was used extensively during the war by the armed services . Even before the war , miniature facsimile newspapers were being broadcast daily by 19 U. S. radio stations to several thousand owners of receiving sets . Today ordinary facsimile transmits news from the United Nations headquarters on Long Island , New York , to a central distributing point . The transmissions are in Chinese , Arabic , Hebrew , Russian and other languages , doing away with the bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-and-white reproduction . But how about color ? Up to a few months ago , for any practical purpose , it was no go . Occasionally a color picture was sent experimentally by radio . This required breaking down the picture into its primary colors , separating each color , transmitting each one separately , and then putting the whole mess together again at the receiving end . It took too long . There was too much chance of " bad registers " ? one color overlapping another . There had to be a simpler way . There was . Capt . W. G. H. Finch , who obtained his first facsimile patent more than 10 years ago , found it . Color facsimile not only is simple , but for the first time in facsimile of any kind it uses plain , ordinary paper ? any kind of paper will do . The use of paper that does n't have to be sensitized and sometimes moistened to boot , or photodeveloped after receipt of a transmission . makes operation of the receiver easy , Light Scans Subject This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be it picture or words , is fastened to a revolving drum . A pin-point light looks at the item with a fineness of 100 lines to the inch . The light is reflected into a photoelectric cell . which transforms variations in the intensity of the reflected light into electrical energy . A filter disk separates the colors from one another . The light source , photocell and filter are mounted on a single carriage that moves along as the drum rotates . The energy from the photocell is amplified and imposed as modulation on a carrier wave . The receiver is something else . Essentially it is a series of mechanical pencils that can be made to mark a line on paper  | in accordance with the instructions it gets from the transmitter . When the portion of the item before the scanner in the transmitter is red , the transmitted signal instructs the receiver to make a red mark on the paper . If the signal says blue , the paper gets a dose of blue . Mixed colors are produced by blending the three primary colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark areas . Black-and-white facsimile can be stepped up to a transmission speed of 44 square inches a minute ( equivalent to about 500 words on a printed page ) , but color facsimile has a limiting factor . Since four pencils have to be given a chance to make a mark on every line , the color transmission is only one-quarter as fast as blackand-white , which requires only one mark per line . Sending a 7- by 10-inch picture in full color , for example , requires about 15 minutes , although this speed is expected to be doubled in the commercial Colorfax model now being designed .  |
