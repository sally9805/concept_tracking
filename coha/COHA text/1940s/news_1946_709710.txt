txt Even from the perspective of four years , many larger campaigns , and the successful conclusion of the war against Japan , the campaign for Guadalcanal that began four years ago today still stands as one of the great moments of United States military history . For it was one of the important milestones along the bloody road that led from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo . After the Solomons there never again was any question about the eventual defeat of the Japanese . Not even the atomic bomb that burst over Hiroshima three years , minus one day , after the Guadalcanal landing had a greater effect on the fighting morale of our forces in the Pacific . The sea battles of the Coral Sea and of Midway had been fought and won before the reinforced First Marine Division splashed ashore on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , Gavutu and Tanembogo the hot , bright morning of Aug. 7 , 1942 . But up to that morning the Japanese had suffered no major reverses on land . In the jungle fighting of Malaya , the Indies and the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermen . On that steamheated paradise of the South Pacific , in the skies over it and the seas around it , the American marine and soldier , the American flier and the American sailor proved that he was as good as his country hoped he was and that he was infinitely better than the little men who opposed him . After Guadalcanal , the issue no longer was in doubt . Today the big island of the Lower Solomons is once more a back eddy of the world , not the focus of world attention that it was four years ago . The black-topped air strips , the coral-surfaced roads and many of the installations built there by the Army , Navy and Marines remain , but where there were dozens of planes flying in and out on war missions during the three years after the original landing , now only an occasional plane circles Henderson Field for a landing . Shaded by the coconut palms , and still well tended , is the graveyard near Lunga Point where lie the more than one thousand marines and soldiers and sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died , that we might live , in the Battle for the Solomons have their final resting place on the floor of Ironbottom Bay , where lie in one small area more sunken fighting ships than in any other similar body of water in the world . The men who fought against the Japanese , illness and hunger for many weary weeks and months on Guadalcanal may not have had any clear idea for what they were fighting and dying . But certainly it was n't just blueberry pie , as one of them was quoted as saying . Quite probably it was with the hope that four years after their sacrifices and almost one year after the end of the war the world would be a considerably more peaceful and orderly place than it is today . Today would be a good day on which to renew the resolve they had , and we had , four years ago that out of war would come a better peace and a better world than we had known before .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
