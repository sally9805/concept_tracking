With industrial production at the peak , most Wall Streeters had only one question about first-quarter earnings : How big would they be ? Last week , as the first big batch of reports came in , happy anticipation fell short of the reality . In general , earnings were so good that , amid the clamor over high prices , they were well-nigh embarrassing . <P> Of the 262 companies reporting , 196 made more money this year than in last year 's first quarter . For many companies , the two quarters were not comparable , due to the strikes and material shortages in 1946 . Nevertheless , this year 's earnings shone golden even against the shining records of last year 's comparatively strike-free and prosperous final quarter . Basically , the golden flow was due to high production . Actual profit margins were hard to gauge because of cash put aside for inventory losses , " contingencies , " etc . But generally , the net return on gross business of many companies was far higher than last year . <P> A notable example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some 35% better than in the preceding quarter and the best first quarter in its history . Beth Steel 's shipments in the first quarter were $237,525,443 , up only about 5% over last year 's fourth quarter . But net profit in the first quarter was up about 33% . ( Beth Steel 's percentage of return on gross operating income was still below 1940 . ) <P> In the oil industry , where the margin of profit increases magically as production is supercharged , results were even more spectacular . Prime example : Socony-Vacuum 's domestic sales rose 16% over those in the same period last year , but its profits soared 73% to an estimated $19,000,000 . <P> In some instances the margin was high enough to make up for declining sales . In the textile industry , now feeling the first pains of a slump ( TIME , April 14 ) , American Woolen Co. had a net of $4,634,000 v. $3,937,000 in the first quarter last year . In the liquor industry , hard hit by buyers ' resistance , National Distillers Products earned $11,770,885 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailing , something seemed to have happened to the boom . Though sales were up , Marshall Field 's profits declined some 20% to $2,562,000 . Montgomery Ward estimated that sales would probably be up 24% to $250,000,000 , but the net of $12,500,000 was down 7% . <P> In the first batch of reports , there were not many such cases . But the squeeze which had pinched them-pressure by consumers to lower prices and by labor to raise wages-was already worrying many companies . <P> One such company was General Foods , which showed a net of $5,446,075 v. $4,644,274 in the first quarter last year . With his report , Chairman Clarence Francis , who chooses his words with care , issued a sharp warning . " Food prices generally have reached or passed their peak , " said he , while four-fifths of company costs have become " things over which we have little or no control . . . . Therefore we are now working on the smallest overall gross margins in our history . " The whole food industry , said he , is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment .
