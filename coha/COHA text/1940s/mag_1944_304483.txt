The strategic conquest of New Guinea , world 's second largest island , * was completed last week by General Douglas MacArthur . <P> There was still some fighting to be done along the 1,500 miles of its length ; 55,000 to 60,000 Japanese troops had been trapped in pockets along the north coast . But for U.S. and Australian troops a grueling , malarial campaign which began two years ago ( when the Japs almost took Port Moresby ) had ended in a brilliant victory . Its final phase was all but bloodless . <P> Considering its strategic importance , MacArthur 's coastal campaign had been one of the most economical of World War II . The first stages had been slow and costly : a heartrending series of marches through jungles and over mountains to battle at Buna , Gona , Sanananda , Salamaua , Lae . But while the campaign to secure a foothold on one tip of the great island was being fought the hard way , a better , smarter war was being planned . <P> Along the Coast . The Allied team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Huon Peninsula-the equivalent of their own 15-yard line . What followed was the military equivalent of a series of seven forward passes , ending on Vogelkop ( Bird 's Head ) Peninsula , 1,200 miles away - the enemy 's goal line . <P> First objective of the new strategy was Sidor . U.S. forces swarmed ashore in a surprise landing on Jan. 2 , while Aussies fought down the steaming Ramu Valley , in the rear of the enemy , toward Madang . The next move , and every one thereafter , was to be a leapfrog pure and simple . <P> Between MacArthur and the western end of New Guinea were two Japanese armies at least 100,000 strong : the Eighteenth , under Lieut . General Nijusan Adachi , with headquarters at Madang ; the Second , spread from Geelvink Bay to Vogelkop 's beak at Sorong . But it was no part of MacArthur 's strategy to meet any of these masses headon . His strategy was to fight only as much as was necessary to gain footholds behind them . Then he was behind them and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then undone . <P> Land , Sea and Air Trap . Lieut . General George C. Kenney 's Fifth Air Force ( later combined with the South Pacific 's Thirteenth into the Far Eastern Air Force ) smashed Jap air power and made the sea lanes impassable for Jap supply ships . PT boats shot up barges which the Japs tried to use as a substitute . <P> MacArthur 's own Seventh Fleet was joined by the best part of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz ' Pacific Fleet , with carriers and battleships , for the crucial move on April 22 : double landings at Hollandia and Aitape , both beyond Wewak-and beyond 50,000 Japs . The Aussies simultaneously captured Madang , completing the trap . <P> From then on , the pattern was so consistent that even the beleagured Jap commanding the Second Army should have been able to figure it out : Wakde Island-on May 17 ; Biak on May 27 ; Noemfoor on July 2 . But the Jap apparently persisted in the conviction that MacArthur 's next move would be against Second Army headquarters at Manokwari.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
