Two Hollywood powers : Sam Goldwyn , because heiea produree , : 1 nd 1 through her column . I N Hollywood , Hedda Hopper is sometimes described as an actress trying to be a columnist . AL Lhe drop of this proposition , it is usually suggested that her rival , Louella Parsons , is a columnist trying to he an actress . Weighed on the basis of respective achievement , the evidence seems to favor the indomitable Miss Hopper . Louella Parsons , a powerful figure as a columnist , has demonstrated , nevertheless , in her few appearances in the movies , that she is a little shaky in the acting department . Hedda Hopper , on the other hand , has tasted sweet success in both fields . Hopper did do a rather remarkable series of flipflops after she finally fell from favor as an actress , but being of good humor and incalculable determination , she bobbed up again as a columnist and has been having the time of her life ever since . Hedda Hopper 's Hollywood , conceived in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began as a weekly letter for which she was paid fifty dollars . Now , eight years , later , it appears in 110 metropolitan dailies under the sponsorship of the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate , and is accepted by millions of readers as the last word from faraway Hollywood . In addition to keeping the nation posted on what is going on in Hollywood , or at least on what appears L. , be going on , Hedda Hopper 's Hollywood prey-11es a substantial chunk of Miss Hopper 's annual income of nearly $200,000 . A weekly radio show complements the column , end Miss Hopper further Ware:maw herself against possible adversity with guest nppearancem , an oecaliional fling at . pictures and a screen-magazine column which appears zionthly and is writ ten by a ghost writer . IP All this has combined to eatebliali liedtla Hopper as an autocrat of the Hollywood gossip exchange whose power is , at times , literally frightening . Edith Gwynn , also a columnist and no groat friend of Mien Hopper 's , . wields perhaps the biggest bludgeon within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade journal . But in the outlands Mine Hopper represents the strident voice of authority that Hollywood has learned to heed . Because of her attentive audience , Hopper frequently alarms Hollywood with her bursts of candor . When Joan Barry walked in olf the street and tearfully told Miss Hopper of her famous affair with Charlie Chaplin , Hollywood begged Hopper to quash the story . Miss Hopper let the movie colony squirm for a week , then released the story , she says , as a warning to others involved in dubious relationships . The effect was so strong that Miss popper . to sidetrack another incipient scandal , had only to waggle a reproving finger at a prominent producer a few weeks later at a cocktail party . The producer , noting that Miss Hopper apparently had his number , too , straightened out immediately . In her column , Miss Hopper does not concern herself with casting news particularly , but deals rather in personality trivia . Occasionally , however , in the name of the great American public , she fixes an authoritative eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studios follow her advice in casting certain players in certain roles .. Her stubborn insistence that Ingrid Bergman play the nun in The Bells of St. Mary 's is generally credited with having been the determining factor in Miss Bergman 's getting the part . It is doubtful that Miss Hopper , for all her influence , has done much to elevate the general tone of Hollywood reporting . Like the rest of the 900 ollywood Boswells , Miss Hopper is none too ac- te , but she is better than most , and local critics invariably give her an " A " for meaning well , since most of her inaccuracies are caused by her failure to double-check stories in her haste to rush them into print before someone else does . She is also legitimate prey for the press agents , who are not always reliable . Hopper. professes a PHOTOGRAPHY BY GENE LESTER prodigious distaste for press agents , feeling that they are interested mostly in protecting doubtful persons in whom the industry has money invested . Because they frequently deal in half truths , she calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is often dependent on them for news . The press agent who told her Bonita Granville was to he married is at ill afraid to get too close to Hopper , in view of the vigorous way she assaults people she suspects of chicanery . Miss Granville , shortly after the item appeared in Miss Hopper 's column , announced , to everyone 's embarrassment , that she had never even been introduced to the alleged groom . The matter was further complicated by the fact that Miss Hopper had stretched her poetic license a little too far by saying that Miss Granville , personally , had told her the happy news . This is a common failing among Hollywood columnists , who , for some reason , had it necessary to use the pronouns " I " and " me " with great frequency . Miss Hopper realized later that she could have saved herself considerable embarrassment simply by resorting to an old trick of the trade and saying innocently : " Is it true that Bonita Granville ... ? " Miss Hopper , because she is high-strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this also contributes to her missing the target occasionally . In her office , she smokes incessantly , paces the floor , swears at everyone within range and dictates her column in the frenzied manner of a small boy delivering the Gettysburg Address from the roof of a burning building . Miss Hopper 's secretary , Treva Davidson , barely manages to stay abreast of the torrent . When she gets ahead of herself , Miss Hopper regularly gets names switched  --  occasionally with disastrous results . In one celebrated instance , she announced that Judy Garland was going to have a baby . Miss Garland , unfortunately , was unmarried at the time , and Miss Hopper later conceded that she must have meant Judy Canova , who was married and was definitely going to have a baby . Miss Hopper also has a difficult time separating Shirley Temple from Anne Shirley . Miss Hopper has no illusions concerning the grace of her literature , and she happily concedes that she can scramble a sentence with the best of them . A recent effort , from which she failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if Henry Fonda 's partners have as much fun dancing with him as he does . " Though her column suggests otherwise , Hopper rarely visits the studios . Instead , she gets her news via the telephone , on the cocktail grapevine or through her leg man , King Kennedy , who is an exson-in-law of Louella Parsons . Kennedy makes the rounds of the studios , visiting each once or twice a week , and , since he represents Miss Hopper , is given more freedom than most snoopers . However , he is still under the thumb and watchful eye of a unit man , whose function is to see that the stars are not bamboozled into ( Can tin lied an Mime 5 n GOSSIP IS HER BUSINESS ( Conti Nor 15J saying or doing anything that would not , look good in the newspapers . Like most Hollywood columnists , Miss Hopper will not reveal certain I rndo secrets involving trick camera shots or the plight of prominent singing Hi are who have to have their high notes rlohbed in for them . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code even further . She will riot , for example , pay for news tips , and she steadfastly refuses to submit to pressure from studios seeking favorable publicity for bad pictures . In the case of Marie Antoinette , a movie which had cost some $5,000,000 , the studio asked Miss Hopper if she could be " kind . " She was . Miss Hopper said that Marie Antoinette was only a small flop . Because Miss Hopper can not type , she dictates her column . The daily output is edited by Spec McClure , an exnewspaperman and one of her staff of five . McClure 's editorial freedom is somewhat curtailed by Miss Hopper 's unshakable conviction that all editors are butchers , and , as a result , McClure is permitted only to cut the hanging participles adrift and otherwise straighten up the grammar , which is likely to be askew . Everything considered , Miss Hopper 's approach to a story is more enthusiastic than it is professional . She still calls newspaper editions " issues , " a foible which would not be put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one occasion , when she learned of the impending James Roosevelt divorce , she called the Los Angeles Times , crying : " Stop the presses , whatever that means ! " Ordinarily , however , in reacting to the impact of what in Hollywood is loosely termed a " scoop , " Miss Hopper confines herself to a simple " Omigawd ! " There is no censoring of her column , but Miss Hopper 's radio scripts are carefully culled for libelous material by a lawyer representative of the network  --  a practice Miss Hopper considers very offensive . Last year she hired a second lawyer to keep an eye on the first one . For a while she tried planting outrageously phony items in the script to divert the network lawyer Jorwori " . ? ' ? ? from the items she really intended to sneak into the broadcast . Encountering only moderate success in this plot , she switched to a plan involving the use of the Significant Pause and the Subtle Inflection to give innocentappearing items their pmpo:r flavor . She hopes to improve on this system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1936 , and not long ago won an award for some special quality described as " caressingly rhythmic speech . " She probably would have been unimpressed by the accolade if , at about the same time , rival Louella Parsons ' voice had not come under the scrutiny of Speech Analyst Frank Colby . Colby concluded that Miss Parsons suffered from " unmusical shrillness " and a tendency toward " two-octave swoops " ? a decision in which Miss Hopper heartily concurred . The suspicion with which Miss Hopper views Miss Parsons ' work  --  and vice versa  --  is an accepted part of the Hollywood legend . The trouble apparently began when Miss Parsons became miffed over being beaten on the James Roosevelt divorce story , but , actually , the feud was promoted more zealously . by outsiders than by the participants . Miss Parsons once called Miss Hopper " contemptible , " and realized later , to her regret , that she had done little more than to endow Hopper with a special new fascination for the public . Parsons also suffered considerable remorse after using her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a radio show sponsored by a food company . Miss Hopper was still struggling for wider recognition at the time , and when Miss Parsons insisted on paying off her guest stars in the food product manufactured by the sponsor , they were disillusioned , and retaliated by switching allegiance to Miss Hopper . By the time Miss Parsons had dug her way out of this cul-de-sac , it was too /ate . Hollywood then proceeded to maneuver the Hopper-Parsons split into a two-way stretch . Vic Mature , for example , emerged a winner by going out of his way to be nice to Miss Parsons . On the theory that any publicity is good publicity , he set up a counterirritant by deliberately baiting Miss Hopper to the point where she ( Continued on Page 57 ) i topper 's heed , I he marriage ended in divorce in 11120 , Before the divorce , a son , Bill , wile born , and Miss Hopper hod eleinged her name from Elfin to Heil &; in a commendable but futile elhirl 10 disiusiociele herself from Hoppees four previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edna and Nel In , Miss Hopper already had won somet hong of n reputation as en actress and had appeared in Virtuous Wives , circa 111l5 , for Louis B. Mayer , who was making his first picture , in New York . Until he offered her a contract , Miss Hopper , with typical indifference , had been able to identify Mayer only as " the little fat man who keeps peering at me through the bushes . " In Hollywood , Miss Hopper skipped from lot to lot on loan from MetroGoldwyn-Mayer . Having started out resolutely to be a screen siren , she was a trifle dismayed to find herself being served up all too frequently as a mother , but she weathered the frustration and , in her time , administered to the needs of such screen kids as Norma and Constance Talmadge , Norma Shearer and Janet Gaynor . Eventually , however , she ran afoul of contract technicalities and the realization that the public was beginning to tire of her face . When it happened , it happened quickly . Miss Hopper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right through it . Largely through the impetus generated by her forceful personality , Miss Hopper simply changed directions . She sold real estate , gave diction lessons , ran for the Los Angeles County Council and lost , supervised fashion shows , wrote a bad play , cadged guest appearances on the air , made three trips to Europe , worked in a beauty salon and appeared briefly in Divided by Three , a Broadway show which closed after eight weeks . Although Divided by Three was a flop , Miss Hopper won considerable acclaim , which so irritated the star of the show that Miss Hopper was unable to take her curtain calls on the opening night because , at that particular moment , she was inextricably pinned backstage in a hammer lock applied by the stage manager , who , apparently , was operating under special instructions from the star . Miss Hopper 's first stride toward becoming a columnist came when " Cissie " Patterson , the newspaper publisher , encountered her at William Randolph Hearses San Simeon Ranch , in California . Caught in the rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who could talk as fast as Miss Hopper would make a good columnist . Accordingly , she suggested that Miss Hopper submit a weekly letter at fifty dollars a copy . Miss Hopper accepted , but after a short time the ante dropped to thirty-five dollars and she stopped writing the letters . Not long afterward , in 1938 , presumably because she had cultivated an impressive array of important Hollywood friends who could supply her with gossip , she was offered a chalice to write a column for a small syndicate that offered an outlet of seventeen papers as a starter . Blushing prettily , Miss Hopper demurred . " But I ca n't spell , " she said . The syndicate agent was unruffled . " Get a secretary who can , " he advised . Looking back now , the producers who pulled Miss Hopper 's screen career out from under her undoubtedly are wishing they had ' kept her in pictures , She not only exercises a fearsome authority by virtue of her colu run , but her picture-reeking rates have skyrocketed from an original $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week on the infrequent OCCHmionx when she player herself in the picl urea . Miss Hopper lives alone in an eightroom house in Beverly Hille with her dog , Wolfe , named with deliberate disrespect for her late husband . Much of her free time is spent in her swimming pool or in admiring her hats . Legend once had it that an effective test of Hollywood sobriety was the ability to recite : " Hedda Hopper has a horde of hooted hats ; a horde of hooted hats has Hedda Hopper . " During the war , Hopper hats were considered sufficiently monstrous by the Germans that they reprinted pictures of them as examples of American decadence . Hopper was undismayed , however , and to prove her unconcern she invaded Europe recently with twenty of them in her luggage . Although she suspects that it is considerable , Miss Hopper has no very definite idea just how much her income of $200,000 really is . Dema Harshbarger , her manager , knows exactly , however , and entrusts Miss Hopper with twentyfive dollars a week , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by both parties , though Miss Hopper is usually around on Thursday for an extra five to tide her over . Because she is incurably sentimental and has a tendency to be overdramatic , Miss Hopper is frequently and visibly  --  and often synthetically  --  pained by what she sees in the passing Hollywood parade . The uninhibited revelry indulged in by some of the inhabitants causes her to roll her ere and shake her heed dempalrinFly . She is likewise puzzled by the socio-political phenom-enon that has spawned the Hollywood columnist , and when she discusses the There are other facets of Hollywood fits lodef mdepsrhe erelliti **27;2680;TOOLONG g iTatin which cause Mitre Hopper . to he irnihdaintgthwe farniedtsorstrrtyoutt rpearntiiesmnt.inSnhoe not fools providing t old-age insurance for veteran actors and actresses . She also believes the industry is treating returning veterans shabbily , and she has suggested a number of reforms , all of which have been ignored . Moreover , Miss Hoppe is convinced that Hollywood is failirs in its mission to instruct and to enter taro in good taste . " All they want to do is make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to do something good and fine , and so what do they do ? They make Ah , Wilderness with music . " Miss Hopper 's boundless energy , which both amuses and exhausts her friends , has taken her on a number of excursions into politics . Globally , she does n't go very far beyond the conviction that something is wrong , and that it might help if Canada absorbed England and turned the mother country into an island of farms . She attended the San Francisco Conference and reported that Archduke Felix of Austria was a riot at dinner parties . On the subject of Molotov , she expressed a curious desire to see his bodyguards play Notre Dame . Mies Hopper also was understandably puzzled by the fact that the small countries made the longest speeches . And she concluded her comments on the conference by deploring the amount of film being wasted on nonphotogenic statesmen . Domestically , Miss Hopper is a rabid Republican and attends all national conventions . The Republicans are pleased to ally themselves with Miss Hopper , but she occasionally unnerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the opposition described Mr. Dewey as " the little man on the wedding cake , " Miss Hopper was so outraged that she repeatedly quoted the incident , thereby giving wide circulation to a description of Dewey the Republicans would just as soon have seen dropped . In the same year , 1944 , Hedda Hopper told the nation that the Republicans attending the convention in Chicago reminded her of polar bears . While she undoubtedly meant that the Republicans in Chicago were warm , cuddly Republicans , she failed to amplify the statement , and the image she created was indeed a bleak one . Feeling the urge to expand recezltly , Miss Hopper hied herself off to England to find out what the masses were thinking , as she put it . Unfortunately , she became involved in other things and failed to penetrate the mass consciousness very deeply , but she did do rather well socially and met Princess Margaret and Princess Elizabeth . To prepare herself and her readers for the event , Miss Hopper repaired to Noel Coward 's apartment for instructions . Coward obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say " ma'am . " Mies Hopper exploded . " Listen , " she told Coward , " I 'm an old woman . Those kids should be doing that for me . " It may have been overlooked in the accounts of the historic meeting with the princesses , but Miss Hopper curtsied and said " ma'am . "
