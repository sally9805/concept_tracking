Under the gauze of London 's blue-grey November mist , the Portland stone buildings of Whitehall , the delicate tracery of trees in Parliament Square , the twin towers of Westminster Abbey all melted together to form a silver backdrop . Fresh sand strewn along the procession route made a golden carpet . <P> British coal production was off about 55 million tons since 1937 ; in many old mines , the coal face was three miles from pithead . <P> The Household Cavalry on gleaming chestnut horses flashed sabers , glinting silver . Behind them came the royal coach , drawn by four grey horses , with the driver and two footmen splashes of vivid scarlet above the deep maroon of the coachwork . Through the windows the crowds could see the King in an admiral 's uniform , sitting erect and wooden-faced under his gold-peaked cap , while the Queen , with her plump , pink-and-white face , powder blue hat , grey-fawn furs , was all smiles and gracious waves . The Welsh Guards Band played God Save the King as the coach went by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians were powerful and uncomfortably predictable . <P> As they had for 340 years , the Yeomen of the Guard , in white Elizabethan ruffs , flat hats with rosettes , and red- gold uniforms , poked tasseled halberds into corners of Westminster cellars , in the traditional " search " for conspiratorial descendants of Catholic Plotter Guy Fawkes . <P> Irgun Zvai Leumi , the Zionist terrorist organization , had threatened to extend its violence to the British Isles . <P> Chattering peers and peeresses , red-robed judges and black-robed bishops fell silent when the royal procession filed into the House of Lords , headed by heralds and medieval figures like the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant , Bluemantle Pursuivant and Clarenceux King-of-Arms . <P> In the King 's speech , written by his Socialist Ministers , there was not much news . Electricity and inland transport would be nationalized , but the gas industry got a reprieve , and private ownership of steel mills might even draw a suspended sentence from Britain 's Socialist masters . <P> Against all tradition , two M.P.s had insisted on debating the first reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which is not debatable and never gets to a second reading . The Member for Rugby , Independent Will Brown , cried : " There probably was a time when the Outlawries Bill was by no means a formal matter and when the House , before it spoke its mind , may well have desired to have guarantees on the subject of outlawry . That form of outlawry has now gone , but there are many other forms of outlawry-and especially the closed shop-which I submit it would be appropriate to discuss now . " <P> When the King and his coach had gone , the House of Commons got down to what was really on its mind : the " revolt " strictly verbal of Labor backbenchers , led by Richard Grossman and Tom Driberg , who think Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin 's policy too anti-Russian . Said Driberg : " I must warn the Foreign Secretary that . . . the people of this country will certainly not follow him to war now or in five years ' time against Soviet Russia in partnership with the barbaric thugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street .
