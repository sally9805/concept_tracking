txt The farm bloc fight with President Roosevelt over , the restricting of prices for which government-owned agricultural surpluses can be sold shifted to the House today as the result of an unheralded move by the House Appropriations Committee . As the Senate farm bloc abandoned temporarily its attempts to seek an agreement with the President on the issue , the House group reported to the floor the 1943 Agricultural Department 's regular supply bill , but with an amendment which in effect embodied the Gillette-Bankhead-Thomas bill forbid- ding the Commodity Credit Corporation to sell surpluses at a price below parity . The Senate had already passed this restriction , but its authors , hearing that it had no chance in the House , threatened to attach it as a rider to the $32,000,000,000 Army Supply Bill and force it " down the throats " of both the House and Mr. Roosevelt . The President by letter called this a " reprehensible " device to force through legislation . When the farm bloc leaders , headed by Senators Thomas of Oklahoma and Bankhead of Ala-bama , failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that they would withdraw from the fight pending developments . Strategy Behind the Step The Senate rarm group leaders professed not to have known that meanwhile the " friends of the farmer " on the House Appropriations Committee were quietly attaching the parity price legislation to the Agriculture Department 's bill . The strategy was to force the House to accept it and then , i after it had been approved by the Senate , send it to the White House to give Mr. Roosevelt the alternative of signing a supply bill for a regular department with the parity price provision in it or have the department 's bill again run the gamut of legislative processes because of a veto . Thus the House farm bloc has taken up the challenge , giving House leaders their second fight , within a week to prevent approval of Administration-opposed legislation . These leaders withheld public comment until they can appraise the situation , but in private conversation they left little unsaid about their feelings in having shunted to them , unheralded , one of the bitterest fights that has occurred between Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions considered likely to engender " side-ring " fights in the House were included by the committee in reporting the bill which carries for the Agriculture Department 1943 activities $695,065,859 , a reduction " on paper " of $458,767,861 from the $1,153,833,720 appropriated for this fiscal year . The new bill , however , carries for parity payments to farmers only a re-appropriation of $2,015 , - 516 , against $212,000,000 for this year . On this question the committee said that it proposed language making it mandatory for commitments by the Secretary of Agriculture for full parity payments , but that it was deemed unnecessary to make an appropriation now , since the extent of the commitments would not become known until the beginning of the new year , in time to vote the funds . " It is entirely possible , " the report said , " that prices obtaining for the 1942 crops will render unnecessary further appropriation for parity payments in connection with such crops . " The committee continued the appropriation for soil conservation payments , recommending $450,000 , - 000 , as against $499,000,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reconstruction Finance Cor-1 poration to advance $70,000,000 for rural rehabilitation loans , $45,000 , - 000 for farm tenant loans and $10,000,000 for rural electrification loans . This is a reduction of $145 , - 000,000 from amounts authorized this year . In connection with the Rural Electrification Administration item , the committee announced that Secretary Wickard had punished three REA officials for submitting inaccurate personnel information to the committee last year . , R. E. Craig , deputy administrator , received " a severe letter of reprimand " and " warning . " Kendall Foss , chief of the Information Service of the REA , was removed from his position Jan. 30 . Mr. Wickard advised the committee " that at the outset , he ( Mr. Foss ) invented a scheme designed to thwart the submission of complete information that had been requested . " W , Lyle Sturtevant , budget officer of the REA , was " severely reprimanded " and was ordered suspended without pay for thirty days . Specific evidence was obtained last Summer , Mr. Wickard told the committee , which showed that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and submission of inaccurate and incomplete data in a deliberate attempt to mislead the committee , the Bureau of the Budget and this office . " Mr. Craig told the committee that he had no part in the matter , but had merely taken Mr. Foss at his word as to figures the comittee had asked concerning the number and pay of personnel . Some Practices Criticized The committee criticized some practices of the Farm Security Administration , but it inserted in the bill almost all the funds asked for the agency . Concerning some of the practices , the committee said : " The hearing disclosed that the Farm Security Administration is carrying on many projects of a character which are not viewed with favor by the committee . Among these is that of lending money to farmers for the purchase of farms from funds provided for distress loans and in amounts aggregating as much as $7,500 in individual cases for farms and improvements thereon . The committee does not believe that Congress intended to authorize such a farm purchasing program with these funds . " In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a corporation of its own employes and bought 42,000 acres of land at $26 per acre ostensibly for the purpose of selling farms to farmers removed from defense areas , but only six of such farmers had been selected up to the time of our hearings . " We were advised that 361,000 acres of land had been bought in a similar manner throughout the United States and that the amounts of loans to individual farm families buying subdivisions of these tracts would run around $7,000 to $7,500 . " The administration is also carrying on experiments in collective farming under a plan which appears to resemble the practice of collective farming in Communist Russia . The committee believes this is wholly contrary to the spirit and the genius of the American way of life and ought to be stopped . " The committee restricted loans to $2,500 and prohibited future land-purchase programs or collective farming .
