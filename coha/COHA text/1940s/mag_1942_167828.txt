In the cloakrooms of Congress the cigar smoke last week was slightly tinged with sulfur . Congressmen , nerve-frayed and work-weary , were hopping mad at the press for " pouring it on , " for attacking good and bad members indiscriminately , the fatheads with the intelligent , the timeservers with the conscientious . <P> Some Congressmen spoke darkly of hauling up some offending editors and columnists before Congressional committees , of ramming through libel laws to shake the press 's teeth , of getting radio time to take their case to the people . Isolationists , whose pre-Pearl Harbor record has frequently been thrown back at them , cried for an investigation of an alleged " smear " gang said to be behind it all . <P> 99% Tripe ? Congress was not only pained but vexed , feeling that the press had gone so far that the prestige of the legislative branch might be permanently impaired . First had come blasts over pensions , soon followed by attacks on Congressional statesmanship , interlarded with denunciations of relatives on payrolls . <P> Congressional choler rose high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press had sicked the public on them , had failed to expose the number of Washington bureaucrats with X cards . <P> The heat that finally sent Congressmen 's rage sky-high was Columnist Raymond Clapper 's remark : " People do n't give a damn what the average Senator or Congressman says . The reason they do n't care is that they know what you hear in Congress is 99% tripe , ignorance and demagoguery and not to be relied on . " Protector of The Press . One of the abler men in Congress last week poured out the typical feelings of the better type of Congressmen : " You just ca n't haul off and indict Congress in general . You say this Congress is an all-time low . Well , I can cite you as good men in this Congress as you could find in any Congress in history . <P> " This publicity was all started by a minority , but the newspapers and magazines are putting the whole Congress in the category of the minority . You ca n't make Ham Fishes out of everybody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hell of a lot of politics and backbiting , but do n't forget this-the President got every bill and every damned dime that he asked for , and it always took a majority of Congress to give it to him . <P> " You take that damned column of Clapper 's . What does he expect Congress to do-go out and run the war ? And if we start that , what will happen ? Why , the newspapers will be the first ones to jump on us and say that we are bitching up the war effort , that we are mixing in stuff that we have no business to , that we ought to shut up and let the Army and Navy run the war .
