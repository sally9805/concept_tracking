The New York Times , almost alone among the world 's newspapers , likes to print the full texts of the more important speeches and documents it reports . So when Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky violently attacked U.S. " warmongers " ( TIME , Sept. 29 ) , the Times took 13 columns to run his speech verbatim . <P> Communist Vishinsky , apparently not an old Times reader , confessed to a U.N . committee that he was baffled . How had the Times " dared " to print the text of his speech ? And why had the Times printed only abstracts of his subsequent speeches ? <P> In his weekly column in the Times , Managing Editor Edwin L. James answered Vishinsky 's question , improving the occasion by reading him a short lesson on the difference between the Russian and the U.S. press . Wrote James : " There was no one who would order the Times not to print the first Vishinsky attack and since it was a formal speech by the representative of a great power , this newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over . There was no one to order his speech printed when there was no news in it and so it was not printed again . . . . Mr. Vishinsky is down on the agenda for another speech . If it is a new speech on a new subject , this newspaper will print it . " <P> When the New York Herald Tribune raised the price of its Sunday paper to 15 ten months ago , the New York Times doggedly stuck to a dime . This week , the Times lost the fight to rising paper and production costs . It reluctantly raised its newsstand price to 15 too .
