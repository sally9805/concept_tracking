As President Roosevelt returned to Washington on the Presidential yacht Potomac from a weekend on Chesapeake Bay , two news dispatches told the U.S. how nearly two other U.S. ships came to involvement in the war : <P> &gt; Crew members of the 125-ft . Coast Guard patrol boat General Greene , home at Woods Hole , Mass , from patrol off Greenland , reported that the ship had been too close for comfort to the battle between the Hood and the Bismarck . While attacking planes roared overhead in the fog , the reverberations of the big guns shook the General Greene , and " some of the shells came mighty near our starboard side . " <P> &gt; Columnists Alsop &; Kintner ( see p. 67 ) published a widely current story : that last month a U.S. destroyer on Atlantic patrol , picking up survivors from a British vessel , was approached by a German submarine , let go three depth charges . Said the columnists : " Although the President is waiting for the Germans to shoot first . . . there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans is to avoid ... an incident . It is perfectly possible that the submarine was in fact sunk , and that the Germans have suppressed all public complaint . . . . The Navy ... is fully ready to act . ... It is far from improbable that preventive occupation of the Azores and the Cape Verdes , or the garrisoning of Iceland will be ordered in the near future . . . . " <P> According to unofficial reports reaching the State Department this week , the 4,999-ton Robin Moor , bound from New York for Cape Town with eight passengers and a crew of 35 , was " torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine " in the South Atlantic May 21 . A Brazilian ship rescued eleven survivors adrift 18 days in a lifeboat . If the reports were correct , this was the first U.S. ship torpedoed in World War II .
