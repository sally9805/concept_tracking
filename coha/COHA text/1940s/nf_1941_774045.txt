txt // The glacier is small in proportion to the snowfield from which it is nourished ; this helps to explain its unusually rapid flow . VALLEY GLACIERS , PIEDMONT GLACIERS , AND ICE SHEETS Glacier ice flowing from mountain snowfields takes the lowest routes available : it follows the valleys that had been cut by streams before the glaciers existed . Such glaciers ( Figs. 96 , 97 , 115 ) , held in between valley walls and conforming to valley trends , are valley glaciers . The Alps have 2000 valley glaciers , the greatest of which is nearly 10 miles long . Valley glaciers lie high in the other ranges of Eurasia ? the Pyrenees , the Carpathians , the high mountains of Norway , the Caucasus , and the Himalaya , to name only a few . The high mountain valleys of the Andes and of New Zealand carry many large glaciers , and in the mountains of the Alaskan coast thousands of valley glaciers , favored by great precipitation and cool temperature , reach down to or near the level of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 80 miles long , is the longest valley glacier yet reported . Southward through British Columbia , Washington , and Oregon , the snow limit rises and glaciers become less numerous . Within the United States they are found chiefly on the high volcanic peaks of the Cascade Mountains , of which the most important are Mount Baker , Mount Rainier , and Mount Adams in Washington , Mount Hood in Oregon , and Mount Shasta in northern California . In the Alps there are in addition to the valley glaciers many fields of snow , neve , and ice , lacking perceptible motion , and too small in size to give rise to actual glaciers . These small fields persist in regions that are not quite cold enough or moist enough to nourish full-sized valley glaciers . This is true even of high ranges of the Rocky Mountains in Montana , Wyoming , and Colorado . The largest valley glacier , however , is puny in comparison with the mighty ice sheet of Greenland ? a continuous mantle of ice that is not confined by valley walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great glacial blanket has an area of more than 700,000 square miles and is thick enough ( 6200 feet at one point near the center ) to cover high mountains and plateaus , burying them completely . Its form , though imperfectly known , appears to consist of two broad low domes or mounds ( Fig. 98 ) , a large one in the north and a smaller one in the south . These domes are centers from which the ice slowly creeps toward the coasts , flowing through valleys that cut through high coastal mountain ranges . Most of these oiii let tongues of ice , which resemble valley glaciers , end in the sea where they discharge great pieces of ice that float away as icebergs. // The Antarctic continent is covered by a similar but much larger ice sheet , with an area of more than 5 million square miles . Partly through outlet tongues like those of Greenland , and partly as a broad continuous sheet , the ice creeps down to the sea and forms bergs . The surfaces of these two great ice sheets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible move ment upon them is furnished by the winds that sweep them , bringing the snow and frost by which the ice is maintained . Some valley glaciers emerge from mountain ranges and spread out upon plains , coalescing to form a continuous thick sheet of ice . The greatest of these piedmont glaciers are Malaspina Glacier ( with an area of 1500 square miles ) and Bering Glacier , both in Alaska . Intermediate in character between valley glaciers and ice sheets , piedmont glaciers constitute a transi tion stage not only in form but also , perhaps , in origin as well . For one view holds that ice sheets are the product of innumerable valley glaciers that formed on high mountain ranges , expanded into piedmont glaciers , and later grew so large that they partly or entirely buried the mountains that gave origin to them . Whether or not this view is justified , we can say with confidence that , within the recent geologic past , many large valley glaciers flourished on the mountains of western United States , a great piedmont glacier occupied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western Canada , and one or more huge ice sheets covered most of the rest of Canada and much of northern United States . Similar conditions obtained in other parts of the world , testifying to worldwide climatic fluctua tions within the recent past . The erosion accomplished by these glaciers and the deposits they left make it possible to reconstruct to some degree their growth , extent , and decline . In order to underGLACIERS // stand the significance of such features , we must examine the work being done by existing glaciers . GLACIAL ERosroN Quarrying and Abrasion . It has been said that a glacier is at once a plow , a file , and a sled . As a plow it churns up and carries away the soil and other mantle , and breaks off and pulls away blocks of bedrock , especially from surfaces that are unsupported on their lee sides . This process is aided by meltwater that percolates into joints and cracks in the rock , freezes , expands , and thus pries out blocks some of which are of considerable size ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under surface , studded with rock fragments of all sizes , rasps away at the firm rock in its path . As a sled it carries away the plowed-up and filed-off debris , plus whatever additional rock fragments may have slid or fallen from mountain slopes down on to its upper surface . The effects of such drastic action on the bedrock surface are conspicuous . In Fig. 99 , a glacier has broken up the bedrock , and has plowed and quarried out large blocks of it . It has filed and polished the part it could not quarry away , forming small grooves and scratches ( glacial strive ) on it , From the direction and distribution of the striae and the quarried rock surfaces in the picture , it is easy to infer that the glacier was moving from left to right . During the filing process , the stones in the sole of the glacier are themselves worn , usually unevenly , because from time to time they are forced to turn in their icy matrix . An ideal glaciated stone ( Fig. 122 , A ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facets meeting each other along somewhat rounded edges . Cirques . Valleys that are or have been occupied by valley glaciers have steep blunt heads ( Fig. 116 ) . These striking features , known as cirques , probably are started by the gradual excavation of niches that are occupied from year to year by snowbanks at the heads of mountain valleys . Meltwater formed on summer days permeates the rock near the edges of the snowbanks . Frost wedging occurs as the temperature at night drops below freezing . The bedrock at the surface is broken up , and the finest particles of the broken rock are carried away by the percolation of meltwater formed during daytime thaws . This process gradually enlarges the depressions beneath the snowbanks . With increasing quarrying and abrasion , the hollows become full-fledged cirques , marry of which are so drastically excavated that their floors become basins . Some of the basins contain lakes after climatic change has wasted away the glaciers and snowbanks that caused them . Cirques // are not made by ice sheets , because ice sheets overtop the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glaciated Valleys . Glaciers do not excavate valleys of their own ; they remodel valleys already formed . Both the valley glaciers that creep downward from the snowfields near the crest of a mountain range and the long tongues of ice that are the advance guard of an ice sheet flowing over a mountainous region follow the valleys that had been excavated by streams before glaciation began . Glacier ice , being immensely less mobile than water , does not conform readily to the bends and curves ( Fig. 51 , p. 88 ) imparted to the valleys by the former streams . For this reason it grinds persistently against the spurs that project alternately into the valleys , snubbing their ends and gradually beveling them into facets . The facets grow larger as the spurs grow shorter , until at length the spurs are worn away entirely , leaving wide and nearly straight U-troughs through which glaciers can flow with minimum effort ( Figs. 100 , 103 ) . The long profiles of some valleys are greatly altered by glaciation . More or less smooth stream-valley profiles are remodeled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembling great flights of stairs ( Fig. 101 ) . In some places the outer parts of the treads are cut from rock comparatively free from joints and fissures , whereas the bases of the risers are cut into thoroughly jointed and fissured rock . This seems to indicate that some of the stairs are made by quarrying in the jointed rocks and by abrasion in the places where the joints are scarcer . In the latter places the rock surfaces are commonly polished , grooved , or striated . Some valleys that have been occupied by vig orous glaciers contain , in addition to stairs , basins excavated in the // bedrock . Many of them now contain lakes . Such lakes are common in many glaciated valleys , and are rare in nonglaciated valleys . Hanging Tributaries . The grinding away of the spurs in a main valley affects the tributary valleys , whose mouths are ground and snubbed back at a rate faster than their own streams , or their thin and relatively weak glaciers , can cut them clown . The tributary valleys can no longer enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing above it , so that , after the glaciers have disappeared , the tributary streams flow out to the edges of cliffs , down which they must cascade in order to join the main . These hanging tributary valleys ( Fig. 102 ) are characteristic of regions sculptured by glaciers , although sonxe what similar hanging tributaries originate in other ways . Most , hang ing tributaries result from deepening of their main valleys by valley glaciers . However , some have been made by ice sheets that swamped whole valley systems . The ice sheets deepened the main valleys , over which the ice was relatively thick and free fo flow , more than if deepGLACIERS // ened the tributaries , over which the ice was thinner and more impeded by obstacles . The hanging tributaries of the Finger Lakes valleys in central New York are believed to have resulted from ice-sheet glacia tion . If the cut-away parts of the long profiles of hanging tributaries are restored by projecting them into the main valley ( Fig. 103 ) they are commonly found to meet above the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been not only widened by the ice but deepened as well . The Yosemite Valley in California , originally cut by a stream , was later deepened as much as 1500 feet by glaciers that occupied it for a considerable time . Fiords . In middle latitudes the features that show a valley has been glaciated disappear as the valley is traced downward , and the lower limit of glaciation , the place where the glacier terminated , can therefore be approximated . In high latitudes , however , most valleys , even along the coasts , have been glaciated throughout their lengths , and are now in part fiords . A fiord is a segment of a glaciated trough that is partly filled by an arm of the sea ( Fig. 97 ) . It is a character istic feature of the coasts of British Columbia and Alaska , Labrador amid Greenland , Norway , Chile , and parts of New Zealand . The Franz Joseph Fiord in East Greenland is 100 miles long and 8 miles wide near its mouth , and in places its floor lies more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the deepest known fiord , reaches a depth of 4250 feet . Such great depths may be due in part to regional submergence of the coasts in addition to glacial excavation . However , some fiord floors include bedrock basins which , if brought above sea138 OUTLINES OF PHYSICAL GEOLOGY , level , would still contain lakes hundreds of feet in depth . Such features can not be the result of submergence alone , but must have been excavated by powerful glaciation . The sculpture of fiords , like the sculpture of other glaciated valleys , is not restricted to valley glaciers . Some fiords have been made by ice sheets as they flowed over mountains or plateaus cut by deep valleys . GLACIAL DEPOSITS All the material in transport by glacier ice , and all the material pre-dominantly of glacial origin deposited directly by glaciers or indirectly in glacial streams , glacial lakes , and the sea , together constitute glacial drift . The name drift dates from a time more than a hundred years ago , when it was conjectured that such deposits had been " drifted " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement , drift varies through many gradations between two extremes . One extreme con sists of drift deposited directly by the glacier without having been flushed by meltwater . The other extreme consists of dri it so l toe o uglily worked over by meltwater that , it , has become well stratified and is actually a deposit made by water . // Till . Drift deposited directly by the ice consists of pieces of rock of many different sizes , usually ranging from large boulders down to silt and clay . The pieces are not sorted according to size and weight ; they lie just as they came out of the glacier ice ( Fig. 104 ) . This kind of drift is known as till , a name given it by Scottish peasants long before its true origin was understood . Till comes out of the ice in a variety of ways . Some of it is merely dumped off the ice terminus , Some of it is heaped up , snowplow-fashion , as the ice terminus creeps forward . Some of it is slowly let down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice beneath it slowly wastes away and disappears . Probably the great bulk of it is plastered on to the ground from the sole of the creeping glacier . Some of the stones in the till ? particularly till of the type last mentioned ? have glaciated shapes approaching the one shown in Fig. 122 , A , but the proportion of such stones is commonly very small . Stratified Drift . Much of the drift is partly or wholly stratified ( Fig. 105 ) , indicating that meltwater has partly or thoroughly re-worked the rock debris carried by the glacier . In some places stratified drift is deposited in immediate contact with the glacier ; also it is dis140 OUTLINES OF PHYSICAL GEOLOGY tributed by streams of meltwater far beyond the terminus of the glacier itself . Stratified drift contains few glaciated stones , Boulders , cobbles , and pebbles are successively deposited as the gradient of the meltwater stream diminishes , and these large pieces are smoothed by the suspended sand and silt washed past them , until their striae and their glacial facets are worn away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to deposits , without regard to their surface form , Some glacial deposits , however , both till and stratified drift , are fashioned into definite forms recognizable as landscape features . Some of the best known of these are ground moraine , end moraine , bodies of outwash , drumlins , eskers , and kame terraces . Ground Moraine . Drift that is widely distributed , ordinarily relatively thin , consisting chiefly of till , and having a gently irregular initial surface form is referred to as ground moraine . The gentle undulations of its surface , in some places including closed depressions , seem to be in part the result of uneven deposition by ice unevenly charged with drift . Ground moraine covers the greater part of the glaciated region from eastern Ohio west to the Rocky Mountains in Montana , and is conspicuous likewise in northern Germany , Poland , and Russia . In these regions the drift is thick enough to have obliterated the hills and valleys on which it rests ( Fig. 112 ) . Drumlins . The ground moraine in some districts in western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the British Isles is dotted with scores of smooth hills shaped like the inverted bowls of teaspoons . These are drumlins ( Fig. 106 ) . Most of them are made of clayey till , and many of them have cores of bedrock . Ranging up to more than a mile in length and up to 200 feet in height , their long axes parallel the direction of flow of the former glacier ice , their blunt heads oppose the flow , and their narrower tails point with it . Drumlins are perfect streamlined forms , offering minimum resistance to ice flow . They occur only where clay is an abundant constituent of the drift , and they probably owe their origin to a combination of erosion and plastering deposition , the latter process gradually shaping their tails , the cohesive property of the clay playing an essential part . The chief geologic value of drumlins is that they record vigorous ice flow , and indicate the direction of movement of former glaciers . End ( Terminal ) Moraines . A generally ridge-like accun ion ( ) I ' drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its l riiiiutiI margin , and having an initial surface form of its own , is an rout ( lrrGLACIERS // minal ) moraine . Such an accumulation may be made by three processes or by combinations of them : ( 1 ) the snowplow process in front of an expanding glacier , ( 2 ) the plastering process beneath the terminal margin of an active glacier , ( 3 ) the dump process at the margin of a glacier whose terminus is stationary owing to temporary equilibrium between flow and wastage . The end moraines of valley glaciers ( Figs. 107 , 108 ) range from a few feet to scores and exceptionally hundreds of feet in height . Ordinarily their breadths are slight . The length of a fully formed and un dissected end moraine is controlled by the width of the containing valley . In plan the end moraine is usually convex down valley , re-cording more rapid movement of the center than of the sides of the ice . The end moraines of most valley glaciers contain but a small pro-portion of the waste removed from cirque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the valley floor as ground moraine , and some of it having been carried beyond the end moraines by streams of meltwater . In many steep valleys , indeed , end moraines do not form at all , because the drift is sluiced away by water as rapidly as it forms . The fact that an end moraine of a vanished valley glacier is incom plete , however , does not indicate that it was not once fully formed , as a vigorous stream readily breaches it and eventually destroys it . End moraines rarely form along the entire margin of an ice sheet because the important factors of topography , atmospheric moisture , and movement , of the ice vary greatly from one sector to another . Some of the ridge , left at the margin of the ice sheet that recently // covered part of North America are scores of miles long , 100 to 200 feet high , and 1 to 5 miles wide . Their slopes are gentle , and except for their broadly ridged character they have almost the same undulatory surfaces that characterize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gaps through which meltwater formerly flowed . End moraines of this kind cross the broad region south of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan in great festoon-like belts trending generally east-west . Each of these belts marks an interruption , perhaps climatic , of the wastage that caused the ice sheet to disappear . The great Baltic End Moraine in northern Germany is through many miles not a ridge but a trench , because , being rich in boulders , it has been thoroughly excavated as a source of paving blocks and building stone for Berlin and other cities in a region where rock is very scarce . // Superglacial Moraines . Many existing valley glaciers carry long ridges of drift on their lateral margins . Built in part by avalanching from valley sides , these are termed lateral moraines ( Fig. 107 ) . The merging of two lateral moraines beyond the point at which two valley glaciers coalesce to form a larger glacier produces a medial moraine ( Fig. 97 ) . Lateral moraines often survive the glaciers on which they were built , but medial moraines rarely do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinkage and disappearance of the ice , and are lost among the debris accumulating on the surface as wastage thins the glacier ( Fig. 109 ) . Forms Built of Stratified Drift : Outwash . A great accumulation of stream-deposited drift in the region beyond the ice terminus is outwash ( Figs. 107 , 10S ) . Choked with drift , the meltwater streams aggrade their beds and shift their braided channels , building up deposits of sediment that reach thicknesses as great as hundreds of feet , their channeled upper surfaces sloping away from the ice with steep stream profiles . The traveler along an active outwash plain has a difficult time of it . Because of the braided channel pattern he is nearly always on an island , from which he has no choice but to ford a swift cold stream . Once across the stream he is only on another island . Some outwash plains , traced headward , lead through gaps in a related end moraine , and m. ; rge with the ground moraine on the other side . Other outwash masses end headward in steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heads of such outwash masses were built against and upon the terminal margins of glaciers that were there feebly flowing or entirely stagnant . When the ice wasted away , the stream deposits slumped down , locally reversing their surface slopes . Slopes representing the former contact of drift with ice are ice-contact faces ( Fig. 110 ) . The delicate details of many of these slopes are spared from destruction by gullies because of the very permeable character of the sand and gravel that commonly underlie them . The rainfall sinks into the ground without running off over the slopes . Kettles . The ice-contact heads of outwash plains as well as other masses of drift accumulated adjacent to a glacier are commonly pitted with closed depressions ranging from a few yards up to a mile or more in diameter . The smaller depressions are usually nearly circular ; the large ones are more likely to be elongate . Many contain lakes or swamps . Such features are termed kettles ( Figs. 109 , 111 ) , and their origin is well understood because they are forming today near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various sizes , either // surrounded or completely buried by drift , slowly waste away and cause slumping and caving-in of the drift . Kame Terraces . Some glaciated valleys contain terraces made of gravel and sand built up by streams flowing between the side of a glacier and the inclosing valley wall . These are kame terraces ( Fig. 110 ) ; some of them have ice-contact faces . Kame terraces thus differ both in form and in origin from terraces that have been carved by streams from deposits that formerly filled the valley from side to side . Eskers . In New England , southern Michigan , and Minnesota , and less conspicuously elsewhere in North America , there are winding ridges of stream-laid gravel and sand , which reach lengths of many miles and heights up to 60 feet or more . The ideal form has steep sides and a narrow top . In North America , such features are called eskers ( Fig. 112 ) , although the word is used somewhat differently in other countries . This term is probably derived from an Irish word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or path . Eskers are the most conspicuous fea-tures of the landscape in parts of central Ireland , where they were used as footpaths by early inhabitants because they stood above the adja-cent boggy lowlands . Probably these curious forms originated in several ways . Some of them were formed in subglacial tunnels ; others were built in crevasses without roofs ; still others were built successively at the // mouths of subglacial streams , where they emerged at the ice terminus into glacial lakes or the sea , and were added to yearly as the terminus migrated backward . Most eskers appear to indicate that the inclosing ice had become stagnant or nearly so before they were built . Pitted Outwash Plains . Considerable areas in Minnesota , Wisconsin , Michigan , New England , and northern Europe , and smaller areas in other regions , consist of outwash plains pitted with kettles . The kettles range in diameter from a score of feet up to 10 miles or more , and are so closely spaced in some districts that the plain is merely a network of narrow ridges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagnant . The ice was seamed with a network of crevasses and superglacial stream channels through which ran meltwater , blanketing the ice with stratified drift which , when the ice disappeared , sagged and slumped into its present position . Records of Active and Stagnant Ice . The glacial forms described above fall into three general groups : ( 1 ) drumlins and end moraines , which record actively flowing ice during their building ; ( 2 ) pitted outwash plains , some kame terraces , large kettles , and eskers , which record stagnant or nearly stagnant ice during their building ; ( 3 ) nonpitted outwash plains , which , having been built beyond the ice terminus , do not fall into either group , although they may be associated with either . As a rule , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) do not occur in the same district . From this we may infer that the physical conditions of former glaciers varied from time to time and from place to place . It is likely that the passage of the terminal part of a glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thinning of the ice as a result of decreased precipitation or increased wastage . THE ICE AGE In 1834 , Louis Agassiz , a Swiss naturalist , observed that the boulders ( Fig. 118 ) and other deposits lying in the ice-free valleys of the Alps were identical in shape and arrangement with the deposits he had seen made by living glaciers in the ice-filled valleys . He realized that the glaciers of the Alps , high and comparatively small then as now , had at some former time spread outward and downward , filling most of the valleys of Switzerland with ice . In publishing this revolutionary i ( ire he paved the way for the now universal belief that the eliuiales el i ie recent geologic past were so cold that valley glaciers stall piill Many mountain ranges , and ice sheets overran vast areas in ill Ainerlea , northern Eurasia , and southern South America . It , is probable that the GLACIERS AND GLACIAL SCULPTURE 149 , glaciers covered in all more than one-quarter of the land area of the globe . The time during which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agassiz made his pioneer observations , the work of the vanished glaciers has been widely studied , and the landscapes fashioned by valley glaciers in high mountains like the Alps have been clearly distinguished from those fashioned by ice sheets , which existed generally but not entirely in less mountainous country . Forms Fashioned by Valley Glaciers . Figure 113 represents a mountain region sculptured by streams . In Fig. 114 the climate has become colder , snowfields have accumulated in high protected places , and small glaciers have begun to flow out of the snowfields and down the stream valleys . In Fig. 115 the glaciers have expanded to the maximum size permitted by the colder climate . They have widened and deepened the valleys , and have left the tributaries hanging above the main valleys . At the same time they have beveled off the ends of lateral spurs , thereby straightening the main valleys . The enlargement of cirques on opposite sides of a ridge has reduced the ridge to a knife edge , which is kept sharp by frost wedging . Two opposing cirques , back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap , and , where several cirques surround the base of a high peak , the peak takes on the shape of a pyramid , such as the Matterhorn in the Alps or the Grand Teton in Wyoming . In Fig. 116 the climate has grown warmer , and the glaciers and snowfields have wasted away , leaving straight U-valleys , hanging tributaries , cirques , and jagged sharp-crested ridges that contrast sharply with the smoother mountains of Fig. 113 . Most of the very high mountains of the world exhibit these features . The Former Great Ice Sheets . The New England-Adirondack region , the highlands of Scotland and Ireland , and the interior of British Columbia are mountainous , and , except for some of the highest peaks , have been recently more than once glaciated ; yet their landscapes differ strikingly from that described in the foregoing account . The crests of the ranges ( Fig. 117 ) are not sharp ; there are no knife-edge ridges and pyramid-like peaks . Cirques are very rare , and the few that are visible are poorly developed . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and striated bedrock surfaces are present on them as well as in the valleys . In any one district the strive on all the ridges point in a single general direction . Evidently glaciation here ( lid unit involve frost wedging and the excavation of cirques , but consist etI chiefly of abrasion . It is evident that these regions were affected not by nacre tongues of ice in their valleys , but by huge ice , sheets // thousands of feet thick that overtopped valley and range alike , as do the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica today . The area covered by the former ice sheets has been determined by tracing the limits of the glaciated regions . The latest centers from // which they flowed radially outward have been located by determining the directions of grooves and strum , the long axes of drumlins , and the paths followed by stray stones and boulders ( glacial erratics , Fig. 1.1S ) derived from known sources in the bedrock . In some places even the general trends of eskers have been used . The results , for North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two ice sheets lay on the Labrador Peninsula and in the district northwest of Hudson Bay . From them the ice flowed north and east into the Arctic regions , and south and west as far as New // Jersey , Pennsylvania , the Ohio River , the Missouri River , and the east base of the Rocky Mountains . The ice of the two coalescent centers was probably more than 2000 miles in north-south diameter and 2500 miles in east-west diameter . The Rockies themselves , and adjacent high ranges in Canada , nourished a multitude of valley glaciers which coalesced as they flowed west and merged with similar valley glaciers flowing east from the high ranges near the Pacific Coast . The resulting great mass of ice , fed from high mountains on both sides , formed a huge piedmont glacier that flowed south into Washington and Idaho , and north to the Yukon , between the ranges that confined it . At its maximum extent this confluent mass of ice was 1200 miles long and 250 to 400 miles wide . In Europe , the principal ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Scotland , the Netherlands , Germany , Poland , and Russia . Many mountain ranges in both Europe and North America supported large valley glaciers , some of which still exist , although greatly diminished in size . Work of Former Ice Sheets . The work done by the vanished ice sheets is considerable . Throughout a huge area in Canada north of the Great Lakes , the weathered mantle was stripped away , and the ice bit into the fresh bedrock beneath , so that today it is naked or thinly covered with drift . Many of the thousands of lakes in that vast region lie in shallow basins scooped out of the rock by the ice . Nearer the terminal zone the drift is more abundant . Although most of the material of the drift has not been moved more than a few miles , some of it has traveled many hundreds of miles . This is known by the finding of rocks far distant from their places of origin . Slabs of native copper from the great copper lodes of the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulders of an unusual conglomerate containing reddish pebbles of jasper , found throughout Ohio , have been traced to outcrops of bedrock on the north bore of Georgian Bay in Canada . In eastern Finland , boulders of ice-transported copper ore were traced backward along the line of former ice flow . This resulted in the discovery in 1910 of Finland 's most important copper mine . Several isolated diamonds of good quality have been found in glacial deposits in Wisconsin , Michigan , Ohio , and Indiana . Their position in the deposits indicated clearly that they had been transported and deposited by the ice , but their source is as yet unknown . It is inferred to be somewhere in central Canada . The surfaces of New England , eastern New York , and the Scottish Highlands are strewn with glacial boulders ( Fig. 118 ) . In these regions of resistant rocks the former ice sheets found it difficult to grind // into sand and silt the fragments of bedrock they acquired . From Ohio to the Rocky Mountains and throughout northern Germany , however , the much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore in these regions large boulders are rare , those found being erratics from regions of harder rocks far to the north . Influence of Former Ice Sheets on Drainage . Many of the streams flowing away from the glaciated region were choked with glacial sediments and built great deposits of outwash in their valleys . Parts of these deposits still remain ; those made by meltwater that came from the latest of the ice sheets and flowed down the Mississippi valley have been traced down to the region of the river 's mouth . Many valleys draining toward the expanding glaciers were filled with meltwater as the ice blocked their mouths , and in consequence numerous lakes were formed . Most of these lakes were drained when the glaciers shrank away , but some of the largest of them , including the present Great Lakes , still remain , partly because the flowing ice had scooped out the preglacial valley floors and thus formed rock basins , and partly because of blockades of drift not yet cleared away . As the ice shrank , it uncovered successively lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels to fall . Even though the ice has disappeared , the lake water is still spilling over basin rims in several places , the most notable of which is Niagara Falls ( pp. 72-74 ) . The former , higher lake levels are still recorded in old shorelines , beaches , lake deposits , and outlet channels . The Ohio River throughout the greater part of its length is chiefly a product of glaciation . Prior to the advance of ice sheets into these latitudes , streams in Vest Virginia and Kentucky drained northwest and north across Ohio and Indiana . The ice sheet flowing from the Labrador Peninsula blocked the valleys and ponded the streams . The rising lakes overflowed westward across the series of divides that lay nearest to the glacier margin , and the overflows were held in these positions long enough so that they were enabled to cut , along the ice margin , a single valley which was followed by the regional drainage even after the ice sheet had disappeared ( Fig. 119 ) . This valley is the valley of the Ohio River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prior to the Ice Age the lower Missouri in Missouri and the upper Missouri in Montana were independent streams . An ice sheet flowing southwest from the region west of Hudson Bay blocked the normal easterly drainage of the intervening area , and forced it to flow south along the glacier margin , thus integrating the two rivers into the single stream of today ( Fig. 119 ) . // It was not only the ice sheets themselves that altered the drainage on a large scale . While large continental areas lay in the grip of glacial climates , regions that are dry today experienced increased rainfall and decreased evaporation , and acquired streams and lakes that have vanished since the climates have ameliorated and the glaciers have shrunk . Western United States is dotted with the dry beds of former lakes or with their shrunken survivors . Lake Bonneville in Utah and Lake Lahontan in Nevada ( p. 122 ; Fig. 93 ) were two of the largest of these former Ice Age lakes . Cause of the Ice Age . The question as to what brought on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely that the great glaciers owed their origin not to a single cause but to a combina-tion of causes . No drastic chilling was required ; comparatively small decrease in present temperatures , continued over a long time , would suffice to bring the glaciers back to their one-time vast extent . Wide-spread elevation of continental masses , building of mountain ranges , and shifting of marine currents , combined with some outside cause such as variation in the amount of energy received from the Sun , may have been an adequate cause of the Ice Age climates . SUMMARY Glaciers are merely snow piled up so thick that it has become com-pacted and flows under its own weight . Fed by continued snowfall , a glacier flows downward or outward , and loses substance by wastage . Nourishment , flow , and wastage are affected by climatic changes and cause fluctuations , sometimes very conspicuous , in the glaciers . Glaciers are classified , according to form , into valley glaciers , pied-mont glaciers , and ice sheets , but they all erode and deposit in the same general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into trough-like forms ; where they flow across broad surfaces , they tend to smooth them out . Near their margins they deposit drift in various forms , both directly and with the co-operation of meltwater . From study of the drift , much of the history of former glaciers can be reconstructed . Glaciers were formerly far more extensive than now , as we have learned from such traces as glacier-eroded bedrock and glacier-leposited drift . The vast glaciers of the past rearranged entire stream systems , and are responsible for most of the lakes now in existence . // EROSION AND DEPOSITION BY WIND Within the last few years there has been much interest in the " Dust Bowl , " a large region in the Great Plains , east of the Rocky Mountains , that is subject to occasional violent dust storms . During the worst of these storms , known locally as " black blizzards , " the clouds of dust cause almost total darkness at midday . Millions of tons of dust are moved in a single storm ; some of it accumulates in local drifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but vast quantities travel hundreds of miles in the upper air , to sift down over wide areas in the Mississippi Valley . Dense haze caused by fine dust from a few of the most severe storms has been noticeable as far east as New England . Strong winds laden with dust have always been common in the semiarid , treeless expanses of the Great Plains . The sensational recent storms that gave rise to the name " Dust Bowl " represent merely a temporary intensification during several years of exceptional drought , after widespread plowing-up of the original sod by wheat farmers had exposed great quantities of loose soil to wind action . These exceptional storms focused public attention on the wind as a powerful eroding agent , and on the necessity of a vigorous program of conservation to prevent destruction of the soil . EROSION BY WIND Wind erosion is of two distinct kinds . ( 1 ) Loose particles of the mantle , such as grains of sand and silt , are picked up by moving air and carried from one place to another . This process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflation ( Latin de + flare , to blow from ) . ( 2 ) In their motion some of the wind-driven particles strike against each other , against pebbles and boulders on the ground , and against exposed bedrock ; as a result , additional particles are worn from the bedrock and from the original loose pieces . This process , analogous to abrasion caused by the action of running water , is wind abrasion . Deflation . In regions that have large or moderate rainfall the results of deflation are not large . Grass and other vegetation protect the greater part of the mantle , and where no vegetation exists the soil particles and sand grains are held together by moisture much of the time . Along seashores the beach sand dries to sonic extent at , low tide , 156 and the wind blows it bit by bit beyond the reach of high tide . Storm waves and unusual tides also carry quantities of the sand to a high level , where it becomes thoroughly dry and is driven farther inland by onshore winds . The shores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Lake Michigan , for example , are bordered by extensive areas of shifting sand . But the essential combination of conditions for effective deflation ? abundant fine-grained , dry mantle unprotected by vegetation ? exists only rarely and locally in lands with moist climates . In semiarid and arid regions , vegetation is scanty and the upper part of the mantle i dry most of the time . As fine particles are detached from bedrock by weathering they are blown away . Silt and sand that have been carried into lowlands by streams are shifted in large quantities by the wind . Even when the weather is comparatively quiet , the air , heated by contact with the hot ground , rises in whirls and lifts the dust in tall columns which move slowly across the plains . During storms the air is filled with dust to a great height and a sheet of sand is driven along the ground . In the deserts oi central Asia and Africa sand storms are a great danger to travelers . Large quantities of dust driven out of the Sahara by exceptional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in a wide area of the sea , evidenced by dustfalls on the decks of ships in the Mediterra-nean and hundreds of miles off the west coast of Africa . The effects of deflation are conspicuous also in some parts of the Mohave Desert and other arid regions in southwestern United States . Sand storms are common in the basins , and every strong wind sweeps // clouds of dust from the bare surfaces of playas ( Fig. 91 , p. 120 ) . No doubt much of the dust blown from such an arid surface is dropped in other parts of the same basin or in neighboring basins , and later is returned to the playas by floods following infrequent rains . However , the wind carries much of the finest material across the mountains and drops it outside the region of interior drainage . In this way the deserts of central Asia have lost vast quantities of fine silt , part of which has accumulated as a thick cover on the hills and plains of northern China ( p. 168 ) . Extreme aridity is not essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Dust Bowl . " In that semiarid district , large quantities of the silt and sand deposited by streams during floods areblown from the dry floodplains and channels in times of drought , when the streams shrink to small trickles or disappear . On the uplands the natural sod of buffalo grass gave the soil a large measure of protection so long as the land was used chiefly for grazing . A large foreign demand for wheat , coinciding with a decade of exceptionally high rainfall in the Great Plains , led to the ill-advised plowing-under of the sod in wide areas . Wholesale deflation of the exposed soil took place even in the most favorable seasons ; but it became disastrous when several years of subnormal rainfall followed in succession . It is now generally recognized that wind erosion can be checked and the region reclaimed for grazing only by restoring the grass cover . However , resetting the sod is difficult at best in such a dry region , and loss of topsoil by deflation has made the problem more formidable . Abrasion by Wind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandblast , operated with compressed air , which is used to clean the begrimed surfaces of stone and brick buildings . Along coasts the sand driven by winds abrades so effectively that glass in the window panes of houses has been known to lose its transparency during a single storm . In some arid regions wooden telegraph poles can not be used because they are cut down quickly by wind-blown sand , and in exceptional localities the steel rails of railways have been worn thin by the natural sandblast . The effectiveness of wind-blown sand as a cutting or abrading agent is explained by the hardness and strength of sand grains , most of which are made of quartz . The most essential conditions for wind abrasion on a large scale arc extreme aridity with consequent lack of vegetation , persistent strong winds , an abundance of hard sand grains , and bedrock that is fairly soft or weakly cemented . These conditions are combined ideally in the Libyan Desert , in northern Africa west of the Nile Valley , one of the most rainless districts known . Except for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is almost without vegetation . Strong winds blow steadily from the northwest , and since there are no abrupt mountain ridges the force of the wind is not seriously checked . In the northern part of the region there are large outcrops of weakly cemented sandstone which disintegrates easily ; the loose sand thus formed is carried to the south , where the bedrock is chiefly limestone and weak sandstone . With such a combination of favorable factors wind abrasion is an important process in wearing away the surface of the land . Its effects are most evident on limestone , which is soft but firm and compact , and therefore becomes polished and grooved under the persistent action of fhe sandblast ( Fig. 121 ) . Since abrasion is most effective near the ground , where most of the coarse sand moves , cliffs tend to be under- ( lit , and slender columns of rock bounded by vertical joints are worn at their bases until they topple over . Areas that have unusually weak bedrock and others that are most favorably situated for wind attack are abraded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained depressions are formed . None of these results are produced rapidly , however ; at best the process is extremely slow , and it is not possible to judge how much is accomplished directly by abrasion and how much by mechanical weathering combined with deflation of the loosened particles . Disintegration and abrasion together produce fine material which is carried away by the wind . Ventifacts . A conspicuous effect of abrasion in arid regions , and ill n ionic limited way along sandy coasts in humid countries , is the polishing and peculiar shaping of pebbles that have lain for : a long time on the ground iii wind-swept areas . Sand driven ley the wind - grinds the pebbles smooth and slowly cuts upon many of them slight ly curved facets that intersect along sharp edges ( Fig. 122 , 1 ) l . II ' ( ) Ile side of a pebble fronts for a long time toward the prevailing wind it finally develops into a facet that slopes upward away from the wind at an angle ranging from 30 ? to 60 ? from the horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topples into a different position another facet develops in the same way . Thus the number and the shape of facets vary considerably ; but a common form of sandblasted pebble is elongate , with three nearly equal facets that taper toward the ends . This form suggests a Brazil nut . Ordinarily the pebbles are made of quartz and of other minerals or rocks of superior hardness , and the facets have a high polish . Many of these remarkable stones have a striking resemblance to artifacts made by men of the Old Stone Age . Partly for this reason , but chiefly to suggest the origin of the polish and the peculiar form , a wind-worn pebble is called a ventifact ( made by wind ) . Ventifacts are valued in geology not for their own sake , but because their presence in large numbers in a region where conditions now are not suitable for their formation indicates a radical change in the physical environment after their development . For example , an ancient gravel deposit widely distributed in northwestern Scotland con-tains numerous ventifacts , although the moist climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciable wind abrasion ill that region at present . It , is uot , l , o be aSSlllla 'd , hmvever , that these wind-fashioned stones signify arid eonditinus at the time of their formation . Gravels deposited in New England near the end of the Ice Age contain abundant ventifacts . New England was barren and subject to wind abrasion at that time because the climate was cold and the ground was covered with sandy , stony debris released by the wasting glacier ice . Wind Abrasion in the United States . No part of the United States is comparable to Libya as a theatre of wind erosion . Even the driest portions of Nevada , Arizona , and eastern California have rainfall enough for the development of stream channels , and it is clear that running water is the dominant agent of erosion and deposition in that region . Wind abrasion is conspicuous locally , as on the lower parts of the walls of narrow canyons through which sand-laden wind is forced with unusual violence ( Fig. 123 ) . Polished rock surfaces , usually grooved or fluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak sandstone and exposed to exceptionally strong winds are // abraded irregularly to form shallow basins that hold water after rains . It does not appear , however , that the total effect of abrasion is large . If natural sandblasting operated widely in that region we should find polished and grooved surfaces widely distributed . Instead , most of the outcrops are rough from weathering , and many surfaces are dark with desert varnish , a peculiar shiny black coating of manganese and iron oxides which forms very slowly , partly through the activities of lichens and probably also by oxidation of mineral matter deposited when water in pore spaces of the rock makes its way to the surface and evaporates . Effective abrasion would prevent the formation of such a covering . Thus the evidence indicates that the only wind erosion of general importance in southwestern United States is performed by deflation of dust and sand . Abrasion is a subordinate process , local in its operation . DEPOSITS MADE BY WIND Like running water , wind loses its carrying power with decrease of velocity and drops its load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary ; they are partially or wholly destroyed by the next strong wind . Other accumulations remain in place until by compaction and cementation they become sedimentary rocks . DUNES Wind-blown debris , usually sand , accumulates to form rounded or irregular hillocks known as dunes . Ordinarily the growth of a dune is started by an obstacle , such as a stone , a bush , or an irregularity in the surface of the ground , which breaks the force of the wind ; after the resulting heap of sand has grown to appreciable size it acts as its own wind-break and causes further deposition . Where sand is abundant and the winds are exceptionally strong , some dunes grow as high as 100 feet or rarely , as in northern Africa and in Colorado , 400 or 500 feet ( Fig. 124 ) . If prevailing winds blow inland across a sandy shore a belt of dunes is formed ; such a belt , with some exceptionally large dunes , exists along the east coast of Lake Michigan , where the westerly winds are furnished with a large supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetation and the dryness of the ground permit the most effective accumulation of sand grains by the wind and therefore the most extensive development of dunes . However , the popular conception that the entire surface of a desert is mantled with shifting sand is erroneous . Arabia is more widely mantled with dune sand than any other large region , and yet the sand covers only one-third of // the total area . About one-ninth of the Sahara is covered with drifting sand . Large tracts in all deserts are floored either with bedrock or with boulders and pebbles . Fine-grained material is swept from these areas as fast as it forms , and accumulates in more protected areas . Form and Structure of Dunes . In the growth of a dune the sand is swept up the windward slope , tumbles over the crest , and rolls down the lee side . The result is a form with an asymmetric profile ( Fig. 125 ) ; the force of the wind tends to flatten the slope up which it moves , but on the protected side the sand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repose , which ranges from 20 ? to 30 ? , and ex ceptionally to 40 ? , depending on the coarseness and angularity of the grains . If the dune is an isolated feature , the wind , provided it blows steadily in the same direction , sweeps by on either flank and builds two long , pointed arms , giving the dune a crescent-shaped plan ( Fig. 125 ) . Even where dunes are closely crowded many of them approximate this form if the wind has a prevailing direction . Shifting winds prevent completion of the typical form or quickly modify it and cause extreme irregularity . Usually the surface of a dune is covered with small parallel ridges an inch or so in height ( Fig. 126 ) ; these are called ripple ! narks from their resemblance to markings made at the bottom of shallow water by the action of small waves or ripples . // The successive layers of sand added to a dune are deposited parallel with its surface and so are more steeply inclined on the lee than on the windward side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal structure . When shifting winds partly destroy the original form the layers are cut across and their edges are covered by new layers deposited at a different angle . Therefore sand-dune deposits arc characterized by extremely irregular cross-bedding ( p. 199 ) . Migration of Dunes . So long as the sand on its surface is free to move , a dune is not statinary . The windward slope is not a fixed incline up which the wind moves only newly acquired sand ; the slope itself is eroded by the wind , and the sand grains removed from it are dumped over the crest . By this subtraction of material from one side and addition to the other the dune moves forward slowly , provided the wind direction is fairly constant . In this way dunes migrate steadily across low country ( Fig. 126 ) , and the movement halts only when grass or other vegetation gains sufficient foothold in the sand to hold it in place . In France and some other European countries belts of dunes moving from the coast have destroyed farm lands , forests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biscay and of the Baltic // region the menace of dune migration has been ended by skilful planting of trees and shrubs . In the United States also considerable damage has been done by drifting sand , particularly near some of the Great Lakes and along many parts of the coasts , both East and West . In some dune areas protective fences have to be built in order to prevent railways and highways from being buried in sand ( Fig. 127 ) . Economic Value of Sand Dunes . Although dunes generally are destructive and barren , in some arid countries they are the only natural reservoirs of fresh water . The sands absorb the scanty rainfall , the water table rises in a curve roughly parallel with the surface ( Fig. 128 ) , and at favorable localities shallow wells furnish enough water to form oases of considerable size ; in northern Egypt large groves of palm trees are supported in this way . LOESS What has become of the great quantities of material finer grained than sand that have been removed from land surfaces by deflation ? Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine-grained sedi ment that covers vast areas in Asia , Europe , and North and South America . Typically it has no horizontal stratification , like that in ordinary sedimentary formations , but occurs in a single massive layer , 20 , 50 , or even more than 100 feet thick . On the other hand , it is full of slender perpendicular tubes which cause a rough vertical cleavage ; for this reason it forms high bluffs along valley sides in spite of the soft , earthy character of the material ( Fig. 129 ) . This sediment , so similar in widely separated continents , is known by the German name loess ( pronounced lies , not to-ess ) . Although loess is exceedingly fine grained , examination with a power ful microscope reveals that a large proportion of the material is not decomposed but consists of fresh , sharp-cornered particles of feldspar , quartz , calcite , mica , and numerous other minerals mingled with clay . It is evident , therefore , that much of the material was ground up // mechanically , and that the particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposition . Because of these characteristics loess is interpreted as an accumulation of wind-blown dust . In support of this conclusion are the numerous shells of land snails and bones of land animals found in the deposits . Moreover , loess is distributed at various heights on very irregular topography ; the wind is the only agent that could deposit in this way sediments that are uniformly fine grained . Lack of stratification is to be expected in windlaid dusts , since the deposit made at any one time is thin and after de-position it is worked over with the underlying sediments by rain , frost , worms , and growing plants . The vertical tubes that are so common in loess appear to represent the stems and roots of successive genera tions of plants that were buried by the accumulating dust . In central Europe , in the Mississippi Valley , and in eastern Oregon and Washington , the dust forming the loess probably was supplied by the dried floors of temporary lakes and by floodplains of streams that drained from wasting glaciers during the Ice Age ( Chap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprotected by vegetation , the wind carried the finest-grained material and spread it out on the uplands ; the abundance of fresh rock flour ground up by the ice movement ex-plains the large proportion of unweathered , angular particles derived front many kinds of rocks and minerals . // In northern China an area as large as France is covered with loess with a maximum thickness of several hundred feet . This vast deposit of loess represents the age-long accumulation of dust blown across the mountains from the arid interior of Asia , and especially from the Ordos and Gobi deserts . Thus , although dust forming this loess was quite different in its origin from that in Europe and the United States , the material is similar because it also was prepared mechanically ; in the deserts of Asia it is the result of disintegration and wind abrasion in an arid climate , and therefore fresh , angular particles make up a good proportion of the deposit . The Chinese loess forms the richest soil of China , and for centurie many of the humbler farmers in the hilly districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep loess bluffs . Locally the Chinese loess is well stratified ; but this exceptional stratification indicates that running water has moved and redeposited parts of the material alter its original deposition by wind . Loess and related deposits represent only the most conspicuous accumulations of wind-blown ( lust ; unquestionably , dust carried in the upper air , supplied either by deflation or by eruptions of fine volcanic ash , settles slowly on the entire land surface and on the sea floor . Probably almost every layer of sedimentary rock contains at least a small amount of wind-blown dust . Some thick-bedded shales or mudstones are interpreted as loess laid down in various periods of geologic history and preserved by favorable circumstances to become part of the sedimentary record . Most loess deposits , however , because of their elevated positions on the continents and the weak character of the material , are subject to rapid destruction by stream erosion and mass-wasting . SUMMARY The wind erodes , transports , and deposits some material in all regions , whatever the nature of the climate . However , it works most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dry much of the time and poorly protected by vegetation . Wind erosion consists of deflation , the blowing away of fine debris such as dust and sand , and abrasion , the wearing of rock by wind-driven particles . Deflation is responsible for widespread loss of soil in semiarid regions where the sod has been destroyed by plowing or by overgrazing . Wind deposits sand and other fine material in the form of dunes , which in many situations are migratory and become a menace to settled communities or to highways and railroads . Vast deposits of wind-blown dust , known as loess , form fertile soil in parts of Asia , Europe , and North America . // THE SEA The gradual crumbling of the land under the pounding of the surf is a fact familiar to all who have lived near the shore , especially along coasts composed of weak rocks . The seaward shores of Cape Cod and the islands near it yield to the sea 1 to 6 feet each year , and at the present rate these lands will disappear entirely at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark their former positions . Some stretches of the Yorkshire coast in Englan ( l have been worn back a mile since the Norman conquest , and 2 miles since the time of the Romans . In the space of 200 years the town of Egmont , on the Dutch coast , was undermined and entirely destroyed by the persistent work of the waves . Cliffs near Dovei on the English Channel are receding at the rate of 15 feet each year , and east of them the Goodwin Sands , now a shallow submarine bank , were formerly an island . The island of Helgoland off the mouth of the Elbe , once very large , was being eaten away so rapidly that it would by this time have disappeared entirely had erosion not been checked , near the end of the nineteenth century , by the construction of a strong sea wall . All these examples concern coasts formed of weak materials , such as chalk , clay , and sand , but the effect of waves on resistant rocks is similar except that erosion takes place more slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for destruction of the land by the sea can be stopped for long periods , measured in human terms , as is demonstrated by the case of Helgoland . Thousands of thickly populated . districts where shore property is valuable have been artificially protected in this way . This study also furnishes answers to such broad questions as these : How far can the destruction of land by the sea be carried ? Why do not beaches , bars , and other wave-built features stop marine erosion ? And above all , since the sea-covered area of the Earth is three times as extensive as the land area , and since the . Earth is admittedly very old , why have the continents not already been destroyed by marine erosion ? Functions of the Sea . The sea is a direct and energetic agent of erosion . lilt by bit , it tears away the margins of the land , and thereby aids the streams in their work of wearing down the continents . Its 169 // floor is the final resting place of all the rock waste eroded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsurface water , glaciers , and the wind . This land-derived sediment is shifted for a while along the sea floor , and , coming to rest , is ultimately solidified into the sedimentary rocks that form a conspicuous part of the Earth 's crust . Indirectly , too , the sea exercises a great influence on the development of the Earth 's surface . The continuous existence of plants and animals recorded by fossils buried in the sedimentary rocks shows that throughout the hundreds of millions of years of geologic history the general temperature of the Earth has never fallen below the freezing point nor exceeded the boiling point of water . For this stability the nearly uniform rate of radiation of energy by the Sun is chiefly responsible , but the sea also serves as an important stabilizer by storing up excess heat against times of lessened solar radiation . The great currents that carry warm water from the equatorial zone into the higher latitudes and the currents that transfer cold polar water toward the equator likewise exercise an important influence in distributing heat more evenly upon the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , in the last analysis , evaporation from the surface of the sea supplies all the moisture borne by the winds to fall upon the lands as rain and snow . Thus the sculpture of the lands by streams , glaciers , and subsurface water is ultimately dependent on the great reservoir of the sea . THE ATTACK ON THE SHORE WAVES , LONGSHORE CURRENTS , AND TIDES Waves . Waves are generated by the wind blowing along the surface of the sea , which is thereby thrown into undulations . When a wave passes into shallow water , it becomes higher and shorter and its front steeper and more deeply concave until the crest arches forward , loses its support , and collapses in a rush of water , forming a breaker ( Fig. 130 ) . The height of the wave determines the depth at which it will break , and therefore small waves break in very shallow water close inshore , whereas great storm waves usually break farther out , where the water is 10 to 20 feet deep . Undertow . When waves break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled-up water escapes in the form of undertow ( Fig. 130 ) , a more or less continuous current which , moving down a shelving bottom , carries rock particles with it . The rush of breaking waves up the beach carries more water to the beach than the corresponding backwash carries from it , because some of the water sinks into the beach . // In addition , the onrush has greater velocity than the backwash . The result is a sorting of the rock fragments being handled : the coarser pieces are moved forward and tend to accumulate on the beach , while the finer ones are gradually moved seaward . The larger fragments are dragged back and forth near the shore , and as they are abraded to smaller and smaller sizes ( becoming rounded during the process ) they are gradually shifted seaward . As they grow fine , they are moved in suspension rather than on the bottom , and at length each particle drops out in places too deep to be affected by motion of the water . Longshore Currents . Longshore currents are set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus give the piled-up water a com ponent of motion along the shore ( Fig. 130 ) . Because nearly all waves are oblique to the shore , longshore currents are common . They are also fairly steady because they are the result of waves generated by prevailing winds . Sweeping rock waste along , the currents tend to remove it from exposed headlands and to deposit it in protected bays ( Fig. 131 ) . They are largely responsible for the formation of beaches , spits , and bars . The fine sand of Daytona Beach , Florida , includes minerals that occur , not in the rocks of the Florida coast , but in the rocks of the Georgia and Carolina uplands . For this reason it is be lieved to have been swept by the prevailing south-moving longshore currents from farther north , where the rivers of Georgia and the Caro-Nis bring it down to the sea out of the southern Appalachians . Tides . The combined gravitative attraction of the Moon and the Sun pulls the surface of the sea into two low but vast bulges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the tides . These immense tidal bodies of water , ceaselessly moving in and out of bays and estuaries and along coasts , set up strong currents which // scour the bottom and transport quantities of sediment . The rise and fall of the tides also aid indirectly in the attack of the waves on the land , by increasing their vertical range . EROSIONAL SHORE FEATURES Cliff and Bench . The damage done by storms to piers , breakwaters , and similar structures is a rough yardstick for measuring the force of sea waves . At Wick , Scotland , during a great storm in 1872 , a solid mass of stone , iron , and concrete weighing 1350 tons was torn from its place at the end of a breakwater and dropped unbroken inside the pier . The damage was repaired with a much larger block , weighing 2600 tons , but , in a storm five years later , the waves carried away this one too . It is not surprising , therefore , that the faces of cliffs are shat-tered by the impacts of storm waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eroding cliffs of fissured and jointed rocks . The air in the fissures , violently compressed by the impacts of the waves , acts as a wedge , springing out large pieces of rock . SPENCE AIR PHOTOS . // These pieces , together with rock fragments contributed by streams , are rubbed together and ground against the shore by every breaking wave . By this process the sea inexorably advances on the land as the opposing cliffs yield ground . The rock fragments dislodged from the cliffs are angular when first seized by the waves , but as they are handled by the sea they become smoothed and rounded ( Fig. 122 , B , p. 160 ) by abrasion , until they come to resemble stream-worn stones . As the wave-cut cliff retreats under the attack of the sea , it leaves behind it an ever-widening rock platform over which the water is shallow . This is the wave-cut bench ( Fig. 132 ) . Its submerged sur face is lowered by abrasion as waves and undertow sweep debris back and forth across it . SHORE PROFILE OF EQUILIBRIUM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep water immediately offshore is applied entirely to eroding the cliff , because the waves lose no energy by dragging bottom before they reach the shore itself . As the cliff retreats and the wave-cut bench is correspondingly widened , and the eliff debris increases in volume , more and more wave // energy is spent in grinding up rock fragments and in transporting the finer particles to deep water . Thus the work to be done increases , while on the contrary the power of the waves to do work along the shore steadily diminishes . Therefore a time comes when these two elements are balanced ; when , in other words , there is a close adjustment between the amount of rock waste on hand , and the amount of wave energy available to deal with it . This delicate adjustment ? a mean through which the opposed forces continually fluctuate ? is recorded by the steepness of the curving shore profile ( Fig. 133 ) , which then becomes a profile of equilibrium . The inclination of the profile of equilibrium depends chiefly on the strength of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any disturbance of this balance results in adjustment that tends to restore balance . An increase in the supply of debris , for example , makes the profile less steep and slows up erosion of the cliff until the Figure increase has been got rid of by seaward transport ; an increase of wave energy steepens the profile and speeds up the attack on the cliff until the resulting increased supply of rock waste again becomes adjusted to wave energy . The evolution of a new shore profile into a profile of equilibrium is like the evolution of part of the long profile of a very young stream into the graded profile of a mature stream . Like the long profile of a stream , the shore profile of equilibrium gradually flattens out as erosion and deposition continue . In the profile-of-equilibrium concept , we can now see the answer to the question often asked , and repeated at the beginning of this chapter : why do not beaches and bars stop erosion by the waves ? These features are built of sediments in transit , and are entirely subsidiary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHORE FEATURES Usually the wave-cut bench is partly or wholly covered by a beach consisting of wave-handled debris . This debris is in process of being shifted slowly seaward , and it gradually comes to rest in water too deep // to permit its further transport . Here the beach grades into the wave-built terrace . In addition to the beach and wave-built terrace other shore features are built by waves and currents . Longshore currents sweep debris from headlands into the deeper water of bays , where , losing velocity , they dump in embankments and build them above sealevel . As long as their far ends are free , these embankments are termed spits . Spits not seriously impeded by transverse currents continue to be built across the bays , closing or nearly closing them , and thus form bay bars ( Fig. 134 ) . Other bars are built in the sheltered water between islands and the mainland , " tying " the islands to the mainland . As a result of abundant stream deposition from the land , or warping of the crust , or other causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep than the slope required for a profile of equilibrium . Under these conditions the line of breakers lies well offshore . The waves drag the shallow bottom and pick up sediment which they carry forward to the line of breakers . Here they drop it , building up a narrow ridge or offshore bar ( often popularly called a " barrier beach " ) paralel with the general trend of the shoreline ( Fig. 135 ) . Wave excavation continues to seaward of the bar , until the profile of equilibrium is attained . The bar itself may be built above sealevel by storm waves , inclosing a shallow lagoon between it and the mainland . The ideal offshore bar is thus a wave-built feature , in contrast with the ideal bay bar , which is built by longshore currents . Probably most bars have been built by interplay of the two processes . In general , the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States exhibit nearly continuous bars , with bays and lagoons developed on a large scale . At Cape Hatteras ( Fig. 136 ) the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but along the east coast of Florida , as at Palm Beach and Miami Beach , it is near shore , and the lagoon in consequence is very narrow . The city of Galveston is built on a bar , and its disastrous flood of 1900 occurred when high seas , driven by a hurricane , rose 15 feet above their normal height . SHORE PROTECTION Buildings and other costly structures standing close to the shoreline frequently require protection from the erosional inroads of the sea . Three general methods are employed to combat erosion of the shore in such places . One is the construction of seawalls along the shore and of breakwaters offshore . The waves are obliged to attack and destroy these structures before they can resume their erosion of the ground back of them . A second method is the construction of groins ? low walls extending from the shore out into the water ( Fig. 135 ) . Groins are effective in many places where longshore currents are loaded with debris , because they check the currents and cause the deposition of the debris between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land behind it . A third method is the hauling or pumping of sand from elsewhere on to the strip of shore to be protected . Ordinarily this operation has to be repeated annually , and is used commonly in conjunction with the construction of groins . As shore property becomes more and more intensively utilized , protection of the shore will become an increasingly important problem . THE CYCLE OF EROSION ALONG COASTS Bold Embayed Coasts . Although the coasts of the continents exhibit endless variety , let us consider two types that occur very commonly . A bold coast marked by long deep bays between pronounced headlands , with comparatively deep water and some islands offshore , is shown in Fig. 137 . This general type of coast occurs in northeastern North America and most of western Europe . Its irregular shoreline is the result of depression of the land or actual rise of sealevel , or both , Irowning the valleys and thus forming the bays . The headlands , being most exposed to wave attack , are eroded to form cliffs ( Fig. 138 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaches , spits , and bars ( Fig. 139 ) . The streams on the land deposit sediment in the bays , and gradually fill them as the headlands are worn away ( Fig. 110 ) , until eventually the irregularities disappear and the shoreline becomes comparatively straight . The shoreline can then change no Blither , but IIi cliffs continue to retreat , and the wave-cut bench conIimles to be vvalcncd ( Fig. 141 ) indefinitely . // Low-Plain Coasts . Fig-ure 142 shows a quite differ-ent kind of coast ? a low plain devoid of bays and peninsulas , and having extremely shallow water off-shore . Such a coast results from the spreading of great quantities of alluvium into the sea faster than the waves can attack and remove it ; it may result also from emer-gence that brings a broad area of shallow sea floor out of water . As a result of the shoal water , the waves drag bottom well offshore , and pick up sediment which is dropped at the line of breakers , gradually build-ing an offshore bar ( Fig. 143 ) . Built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands inclosing a lagoon. 179 THE SEA The sea floor outside the bar is gradually excavated by the waves , the eroded material is added to the bar , and the profile is converted into a profile of equilibrium . The waves are then able to break with force against the bar itself , eroding its sea-ward face . Part of the re-sulting debris is carried out to sea , and during storms part is thrown over the bar into the edge of the lagoon . By this process of erosion of its seaward face and deposi-tion on its lagoonward face , the bar is gradually shifted shoreward ( Fig. 144 ) . At the same time longshore cur-rents add to the length of the bar by building out one or both of its free ends . Meanwhile the lagoon , shallow even at the start , is slowly filled with sediment washed into it from the land , // as well as with the sediment thrown over the bar . Where the water is shallow enough , vegetation thrives and adds its quota to the accumulating sediment , locally forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the bar is driven shoreward the lagoon becomes a tidal marsh throughout its extent . Eventually both bar and lagoon filling are completely cut away as the breaking waves continue their attack upon the land . With the disappearance of the offshore bar a wave-cut cliff and beach are rapidly formed ( Fig. 146 ) and the cliff retreats and the bench widens indefinitely . Much of the Gulf Coast of North America is a low-plain coast of this general kind . In most places it has already progressed to the stage of extensive bar building . Both the bold embayed coast and the low-plain coast just de-scribed are ideally simple . Actually the histories of most coasts are complex , involving both upward and downward movements of the land relative to sealevel , and require very detailed study before they can be fully understood . ISLANDS Types of Islands . Here and there the surface of the sea is inter rupted by islands and by submerged peaks that are not quite islands . // Many of these are the tops of hills , mountains , and larger land masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the islands off New England and the British Isles were so formed . Others , including Bermuda , the Azores , many of the smaller West Indian islands , and the majority of the smaller Pacific islands including the Hawaiian group , are volcanic cones built up on the sea floor . Smaller islands are sometimes formed by the rock residuals left by wave erosion , and by deposits in the form of offshore bars . Coral Reefs . In the warm shallow water around many tropical and subtropi cal islands , especially in the Pacific , coral reefs abound . Corals ( polyps ) , other shell-forming animals , and lime-secreting marine plants build these elaborate structures of calcium carbonate which they secrete as limy skeletons out-side their bodies . The corals reproduce by budding in plant-like fashion , so that col-onies of many thousands of individuals , each living in its own tiny protecting chamber like a cliff-dweller in a city of stone , combine to build a st ructure of great size . As the colonies expand and build upward , the older organ-isms ( lie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new generations and by the debris broken by storm waves from the living parts above . The accumulating deposit is eventually cemented into a white spongy limestone upon whose upper surface the living organisms flourish ( Fig. 147 ) . The resulting structure is a coral reef . Over the reef t be waves swirl and break , and at its outer edges , where oxygen , calcium carbonate , and food material are most abundant , the organisms thrive best . Figures 148-150 illustrate three common types of reefs , differing from each other only in their relation to the land . // THE SEA FLOOR AND THE SEDIMENTS ON IT Deep-Sea Basins and Continental Shelves . The enormous depressions that contain the greater part of the sea are the largest individual features of the Earth 's crust ( Fig. 1 ) . Not only is their combined area more than twice that of the continental masses , but they have an average depth of 2 ? miles , whereas the average height of the continents ( above sealevel ) is only about half a mile . At present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilling over them , it floods the margins of the continental masses , covering the continental shelves with shallow water ( Figs. 1 , 151 ) . The shelves are widened partly by continuous erosion of the land by the sea and partly by the Figure deposition of sediment swept into the basins by marine currents . Along stable coasts where these processes have operated with least interruption for a long period , the shelves are broad . Thus the shelf off the Atlantic coast of North America is 60 to 80 miles wide in the latitude of the Carolinas . The shelf off the unsteady Pacific Coast , however , is in many places less than 10 miles wide , because throughout recent geologic time this part of the continental mass and the adjacent deep-sea floor have not stood still long enough to allow a broad shelf to be made . Depth Zones . There is a marked distinction between the depth of water over the continental shelves ( whose greatest depths range from about 350 to more than 600 feet ) and the depth of water in the deepsea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forming continental slopes , most of which are gentle and are many miles in length from top to base . Accordingly three important depth zones can be recognized : ( 1 ) the shelf zone , covering the continental shelves , ( 2 ) the continental-slope zone , covering the continental slopes , and ( 3 ) the deep-sea zone , covering the deep-sea floor . At present the combined area of the first two is but a fraction of the area of the third , although a slight upwarping of the deep-sea floors with concurrent downwarping of the continental masses would enormously increase the shelf zone by forcing the sea to spread far inland over the lowest lands . // A fourth zone must be included to make the classification complete : a shore zone , embracing the area between the levels of high and low tide , and therefore losing its water twice every day . These four zones ( Fig. 151 ) have an important geologic significance , because the processes in operation upon them , the deposits being formed within them , and the forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Topography of the Sea Floor . The sea floor was formerly conceived to be a monotonous plain with gentle slopes and very little local relief . This belief resulted from the fact that until recently , soundings were made from exploring ships by the process of paying out wires to which weights were attached . This operation was so laborious that soundings were few and too widely spaced to detect much local relief . Within recent years , however , there has been developed a method whereby sound waves are transmitted from a ship to the bottom , from which they are reflected and are picked up again on the ship by an instrument which automatically calculates and records the depth . The position of the ship is determined by surveying methods , and in this way an area of sea floor can be charted both quickly and accurately . Sound-wave surveying of this kind has revolutionized our picture of the sea floor . Instead of the plains-like surfaces that were once believed to be nearly universal , broad areas of the floor are now known to have an intricacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some places the detail appears to have resulted from local warping and faulting of the crust ( p. 244 ) and submarine volcanic activity , but iu others it consists of valley systems somewhat like those that diversify the land ( Fig. 152 ) . Geologists are not agreed as to whether these features are valley systems cut by streams and later submerged , or depressions excavated by currents beneath the sea . Sea-Floor Sediments . Depth of water is a factor supremely important to marine deposition , for it determines the effectiveness of waves and currents in distributing rock waste worn from the lands , and at the same time , by controlling the sunlight and heat that penetrate to the sea floor , it regulates the habitats of rock-forming sea animals and plants . No two marine regions are exactly alike in the nature and distribution of the sediments that are accumulating upon them , but certain general principles are applicable to all . The rock waste derived from the land is in more or less constant transit seaward , until bit by bit it cones to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by waves and currents , and there it remains as long as those parts of the sea heroine no shallower . // The continental shelves and continental slopes are mantled with fine sediments washed out or blown out from the land . But the deepsea floor is widely covered with extraordinarily fine , slimy deposits known as oozes . Thousands of samples have been caught by ingenious scoops let down on wires many miles in length from specially equipped vessels . In recent years the scoops have been replaced by a heavy gun which , when it reaches the bottom , fires a 10-foot tube like a giant apple corer , into the sea floor . The tube closes , and the core of sediments is hauled to the surface . When these oozes are examined under the microscope , they prove to be made up of fine wind-blown dust ( much of it volcanic ) , meteoritic dust fallen from outside the Earth , and a great quantity of shells of microscopic floating animals and plants that have drifted down upon the deep-sea floor . Composition of Sea Water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dissolved mineral substances , most of which have come from the lands ( p. 191 ) . When sea water is evaporated , more than three-quarters of its mineral content is precipitated as common salt ( NaCl ) . Among the many other substances pre:ent are calcium carbonate ( CaCO , , ) and silica ( SiO2 ) , both present in small quantities although delivered to the sea by the rivers of the world in large quantities . They are prevented from accumulating in the sea through being removed by chemical precipitation and by marine organisms which use them in forming their shells . The total quantity of the salts dissolved in the sea is astonishing . If precipitated and crystallized into a bed of solid salts , it would form a layer nearly 150 feet thick over the entire surface of the Earth . SUMMARY The effect of waves along coasts is to erode the land . The shore retreats , and the eroded rock waste is carried seaward and spread out on the sea floor . During the process , the cliff and bench , the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The detailed changes that occur depend in part on the form of the coast at the outset of erosion . In the opening paragraphs of this chapter we asked : How far can the destruction of land by the sea be carried ? Now we have the answer : In theory there is nothing to prevent all the lands from being gradually eaten away by the sea . But actually the possibility is very remote , because the uneasy crust does not stand still long enough to peru ii , the thing to happen . A very slight uplift suffices to bring a great deal of land out of water , and when this happens ( it // has happened many times during the Earth 's decipherable history ) the process of erosion by waves is forced to begin again long before the original job has been completed . What of the rock waste produced by this erosion ? Most of the sediment thus derived from the land settles to the bottom in the comparatively shallow shelf zone ; very little of it reaches the deepsea floor . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sediments that have been converted into rocks . // SEDIMENTS AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS As their name denotes , sedimentary rocks are sediments that have been converted into rocks . The processes now at work on the Earth 's surface in depositing sediments are explained in the previous chapters . Most sediments were laid down in bodies of water ? streams , lakes , and especially the sea ? in short , are water laid , but wind-laid and ice-laid deposits are also abundant . In popular language , " sediment " means the fine-grained material that has settled out of a liquid ; but in the broader usage of geology coarse material also is included . To take some extreme examples , glacial and alluvial deposits containing boulders many feet in diameter are included among the sediments . Since most sediments are deposited in more or less regular layers , or strata , the sedimentary rocks are known also as stratified rocks ( Fig. 153 ) . Sediments now being formed , or formed so recently that we can be sure what were the conditions under which they were laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluvial fan ( p. 78 ) , the abandoned stream courses radiating from the apex of the fan expose vertical sections that they have cut into the deposit . In these sections we can see the material of which the fan is made and its arrangement or structure ( Fig. 154 ) . Recent stream-laid deposits also can readily be examined . Reservoirs that for some reason have been drained off become gullied , and these gullies furnish excellent cross-sections of the accumulated sediments . The cores of deep-sea sediment brought up from the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean in recent years ( p. 185 ) give us sections as much as 10 feet long of the material that is now accumulating there . The sediment contains shells of organisms of the kinds living in the surface waters as well as of those living on the muddy sea floor . Thus the environmental conditions in which the sediments are accumulating as well as the sediments themselves are completely known . To all these examples , from fan deposit to deepsea sediment , we can apply the uniformitarian principle of Lyell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 10 ) . The facts obtained by examining sediments now being formed under known conditions help us to interpret how the sediments in the past were formed . 187 // For the problem considered in this chapter is the inverse of that considered in the earlier chapters , which explain the processes now visibly operating on the Earth . The problem now before us is one frequently met in geology . It is this : Given a sedimentary rock , what can we infer in regard to the conditions that prevailed while it was forming ? Where was the land mass from which its material was derived , what was the climate of this land mass , and what was the nature of the rocks in it , how was the material carried to the place where it was deposited ? was it carried by water , wind , or ice ? and what conditions prevailed at the place where the sediment accumulated ? ORIGIN AND KINDS OF SEDIMENTS The products of the wearing down of the land area of the globe by erosion are of two kinds : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 36 ) , and the other , chemical ? substances , such as calcium carbonate , dissolved by the waters of the streams . The fragments are eventually dropped by the transporting agent , be it water , wind , or ice , and they accumulate as a sedimentary deposit . The dissolved matter is carried to the sea , where some of it separates from solution and the remainder accumulates in the sea water . Consequently there are two main classes of sediments : ( 1 ) detrital sediments , and ( 2 ) sediments separated from solution . The detrital sediments are classified on the basis of the size of their constituent particles . In descending order of size they comprise gravel , sand , silt , and mud . Gravel is a coarse sediment consisting mainly of rounded fragments larger than 2 millimeters in diameter ; commonly more or less sand is admixed . When first torn from their parent ledges of bedrock , the stones that comprise the rounded fragments in a gravel were irregular , angular pieces bounded by joints or fracture surfaces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves they lost their edges and corners and became rounded ; as the technical phrase goes , they have become water worn ( Fig. 155 ) . Angular and subangular pieces in gravels indicate , therefore , that they have not traveled far from where their parent rocks occur in place . As they travel downstream , the pebbles of the softer and less coherent rocks are the first to be worn down to the size of sand . Consequent ly , hard materials , such as quartz and rocks composed of quartz , predominate gravels that consist of well-rounded pebbles . Toughncss , in the sense of resistance to fracture under impact , is even more important than hardness iii prolonging the life of pebbles during transport . On the other Land , gravels whose pebbles have not trav190 OUTLINES OF PHYSICAL GEOLOGY eled far may include less durable minerals ( feldspars ) and rocks such as schist and limestone . Limestone pebbles , in fact , are rare in the gravels of humid regions , because they are reduced in size not only by abrasion but also , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is composed of grains smaller than pebbles but exceeding 0.2 millimeter in diameter . Quartz is the commonest constituent in sand , because of its chemical indestructibility and its hardness ; and unless otherwise specified " sand " means quartz sand . However , rock fragments and many minerals other than quartz , such as feldspar , occur in some sands . The beaches of coral islands are in places formed of " coral sand " made up of broken bits of coral and other organic re-mains ; and the green sands on Hawaiian beaches consist of grains of olivine . Silt is so fine grained that , unlike sand , it will cohere when wet . Mud , and its principal variety , clay , consist of particles still finer than those of silt size ? less than 0.002 millimeter in diameter . Along with this decrease in grain-size goes a change in the minerals that make up the clay . Quartz decreases in amount , and the finely flaky minerals increase . During transport the flaky minerals , because of their easy cleavability , become comminuted to the tiniest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float , these flakelets lag behind the quartz in settling out of the water in which they are suspended . To its content of flaky minerals and the effect of the films of water on the flakes , which act as a lubricant , clay owes its most important technologic property ? its plasticity , by virtue of which it can be molded when wet into any desired shape , and will retain this shape on drying . // Clays , as the products of the deposition of the finest detritus , have a wide range of composition . The most characteristic components , the flaky minerals already mentioned , are white mica , chlorite , and various compounds of aluminum . These minerals are formed chiefly by the chemical weathering of the source rocks . In glacial clays and silts deposited in lakes and seas receiving the meltwater from glaciers , particles of fresh , unweathered rocks and minerals predominate , however , since glaciers by their powerful abrasive action grind immense quantities of " rock flour , " i.e. , rocks and minerals ground to n impalpable powder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter taken into Volution during the chemical erosion of the lands . Every square mile of the 40,000,000 square miles of the Earth 's surface draining to the sea contributes yearly 70 tons of dissolved matter , mainly calcium carbonate and silica , but also many other constituents . Some of these minor constituents , such as phosphates and nitrates , are of profound importance in determining the abundance of life in the sea . We may add that one very minor constituent ? iodine ? is also of importance to life on land , being absolutely essential in human nutrition , and the main source of iodine in the soil is wind-borne spray from the sea . The dissolved matter is in part withdrawn from the sea by various means ; in part it accumulates , increasing the saltness of the sea . At many times in the geologic past , arms of the sea have evaporated sufficiently to cause the dissolved salts to be thrown down as rock-salt beds , but vast as thes , are , humanly considered , they are mere bagatelles compared to the enormous deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Limestone represents the dissolved calcium carbonate that was carried by the streams to the sea and was there withdrawn from solution . The solubility of calcium carbonate is extremely ensitive to the amount of carbon dioxide present in the water , and anything that decreases the content of the carbon dioxide in a saturated solution of calcium carbonate causes immediate precipitation of calcium carbonate . Rise of temperature drives off some of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the sea water and thus causes calcium carbonate to precipitate ; precipitation of this kind is termed inorganic . Removal of the carbon dioxide by algae , plants of simple organization , which under the influence of sunlight are able to utilize the carbon dioxide in the sea water as a source of carbon in building their tissues , is another cause of precipitation ; and certain groups of bacteria , by producing ammonia , which coucbines with the carbon dioxide , can cause precipi192 OUTLINES OF PHYSICAL GEOLOGY tation . Precipitation of this kind is called biochemical . In addition lime-secreting animals and plants abstract enormous quantities of calcium carbonate from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells become incorporated in the sediments ; removal of carbonate by organisms in this fashion is termed organic . Sediments formed by these processes acting singly or in combination , are rich in calcium carbonate and are termed calcareous . Calcareous sediment in the form of a fine mud is now being precipitated extensively in parts of the sea . One of the largest areas in which this is taking place is the Bahama Banks , south of the Florida Straits . The area of this great shoal exceeds 7000 square miles , and the depth of the water over it averages less than 20 feet . Much of the floor of the shoal is mantled by fine white calcareous mud . The cause of deposition of this mud is still uncertain . Coral reefs are limited to the margins of the shoal and appear not to contribute much to the deposit at the present time . It is thought that bacteria , chiefly those of the group that produce ammonia , cause the precipitation of the calcium carbonate , but purely inorganic processes , namely evaporation and warming of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silica , although carried in dissolved form to the sea in enormous quantity by the rivers of the world , is kept down to a vanishingly small amount because it is being steadily withdrawn by silica-secreting organisms ? sponges , radiolaria ( microscopic unicellular animals ) , and diatoms ( microscopic unicellular plants ) , all of which use the silica in building their shells . In former times radiolaria and diatoms have flourished in such inconceivable abundance that their remains gave rise to thick series of strata of wide lateral extent . The organisms are so minute that there may be as many as a million to the cubic inch . Later these remains became transformed into exceedingly hard , waxy-lustered or porcelain-like rocks called cherts . Rocks formed in this way are common in the Coast Ranges of California and Oregon . Tuff and volcanic breccia ? rocks made of pyroclastic material ( Chap . 16 ) in contradistinction to the detrital material produced by the fragmentation of older rocks by erosion ? have formed stratified deposits , many of them of great thickness and wide extent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most widely continuous deposits known . A single mighty explosive eruption , such as that of Tamboro , on Sambawa Island east of Java , in 1815 , when between 28 and 50 cubic miles of material were blown out , can spread a continuous layer of tuft over an area of 1,000,000 square miles . // Tuffs and volcanic breccias are regarded by some as igneous rocks , because they are made by igneous activity ; on the other hand they consist of fragments that accumulated according to the laws of sedimentation , and from this point of view they can be regarded as sedimentary rocks . CONVERSION OF SEDIMENTS INTO ROCKS Sediments when first laid down are generally loose , incoherent , and highly porous . They become changed into rocks by compaction as the result of sedimentary loading , by the deposition of cement in the pore spaces , and by physical and chemical changes in the constituents . Not all these processes necessarily affect every sediment . The result of any or all of them is to render the sediment firmer , harder , more coherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become lithified . Compaction by loading is most effective in the clay sediments . As the sediments grow in thickness , the overlying beds press more and more heavily on those below them . In clays this loading crowds the grains together and squeezes out the water in the pores . The clay becomes a shale . A freshly deposited clay has a porosity of 50 per cent or more ; by the time the clay has been buried 1000 feet deep it has become compacted to 80 per cent of its original volume ; to 60 per cent at 3000 feet ; and to 55 per cent at 5000 feet . Pressure produced by sedimentary loading is of minor effect in sands , causing little or no compaction , but it may aid them to become consolidated by welding , by bringing the individual grains into such close contact that the molecular attractive forces will cause them to cohere . The result of this process is to change the sand into a sandstone . Another process that changes sediments into rocks is due to the habit of the colloidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alumina , and iron ) ? to undergo spontaneous changes soon after coagulation , whereby they lose water and harden . Silica jelly ( or " gel " ) when freshly precipitated is a soft , gelatinous mass ; on ( lying , as the chemists say , it hardens into opal , and the opal may biter crystallize into chalcedony . Changes of this kind , though affecting only the mineral jellies distributed in small amount through the mass of a sediment , can cause a marked increase in coherence and hardness . Cementation is the deposition of mineral matter in the spaces between the grains of sediment . The most common cements are calcite , silica in the form of quartz or chalcedony , and iron oxide . These cements may he deposited concurrently with the crystallization // of any colloids disseminated through the sediments , or they may be brought in later , either from the adjacent body of sediment or from afar , by subsurface water moving through the pore spaces . Sands , because of their permeability , are particularly subject to cementation by material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , the less pore space in the resulting rock . If the cement is quartz and was so abundantly deposited as to fill the interstices completely , the resulting rock is a quartzite . Calcareous sediments manifestly are easily lithified , the resulting rock being a limestone ; rarely do we find incoherent calcareous sediments , such as chalk . This ready change into limestone is doubtless determined by the relatively easy solubility of calcite . The change of a sediment into rock by compaction , by the welding together of adjacent grains , and by the hardening caused by the aging of the colloidal constituents may go on practically contemporaneously with accumulation ; or it may be postponed , and in some sediments it may never occur . In general , the older sediments have become more thoroughly consolidated than the younger . Sediments of geologically recent origin as a rule are loose and incoherent ; the more ancient sediments have generally been converted into firm rocks . That time , however , is not the factor that converts sediments into rocks is shown by the occurrence of very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient sandstone at Minneapolis that is so weakly cemented that it was cut with a high-pressure water jet during tunneling operations . CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS Stratification . The most conspicuous feature of the sedimentary rocks as seen in exposures in the field is their layered structure ( Fig. 153 ) . Each layer is a bed or stratum ( plural , strata ) , the two terms being synonymous . Beds differ greatly in thickness : from those hardly more than a film to those scores of feet thick . Each bed is separated as a rule from the bed below it and the bed above it by distinct parting planes or surfaces , which are the bedding planes or stratification planes . Stratification is made most evident to the eye by the bedding planes . It is emphasized by the fact that adjacent beds may differ in color , or in composition , or in texture ; commonly a bed differs from those inclosing it in all three of these characters . Other features , such as joint planes and the cleavage of slates , in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geologic structure of a region , and therefore the ability to distinguish it surely from all other apparently similar features is of prime importance . // Sedimentary strata are horizontal or nearly so at the time when they are laid down . Consequently , strata that are flat lying , as in Fig. 153 , are said to be in undisturbed attitude . In many places , however , they are found to be not horizontal but inclined or even standing vertically . We are then forced to conclude that they have been tilted from their original horizontal position ; they have been disturbed , and if steeply inclined or vertical they have been greatly disturbed . Most sedimentary rocks have the layered structure called bedding or stratification . Absence of this structure in a sedimentary rock suggests , in fact , that the rock was formed in one of the less common ways of sedimentary deposition . Such lack of stratification is a feature by which we recognize a tillite ? a lithified till ( p. 139 ) . Loess , formed by wind deposition ( p. 166 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly caused by changes in the velocity of the transporting agent . An obvious example is afforded by the fine silt and clay that are deposited upon coarse gravels during times of diminished flow of water on an alluvial fan . Changes in velocity may occur daily , as on the outwash plain fronting a glacier , where the transporting competence of the streams varies enormously with the time of day . Such variation is vividly impressed on anyone who has had to ford the braided network of streams flowing from a glacier : low water in the cool of the morning when melting of the ice is at a minimum , flood water in the heat of the afternoon , when the continuous bumping of boulders moving downstream can be heard . More commonly the changes in the velocity of streams are seasonal , owing to flood stages during the rainy season and low water during The dry season . In the sea the normal arrangement of sediments is this : coarse material lies near the shore and grades seaward into fine material  - -  muds . In times of storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sediment is moved out into deeper water and is laid down on the muds that had accumulated earlier during periods of calm . An alternation or interstratification of coarse and fine sediments is thus produced . Change in the kind of material deposited causes the resulting sediments to be stratified . Limestone beds alternating with shale beds exemplify how greatly the composition of the sediment differed from time to time . Shifting of marine currents is one cause of such abrupt changes . A layering caused by the annual march of the seasons appears to be well developed in certain sedimentary deposits . Such an annual // deposit is called a varve , regardless of whether it was formed in the sea , a lake , or elsewhere . Most varves consist of two thin layers of differing composition , one of which was laid down during the summer and the other during the winter . Such laminated sediments occur in glacial clays where their annual origin appears to be well established , so that they can confidently be called varves . Annual deposits occur in some lake deposits now forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain marine shales , in playa clays , in dune sands , and in marine salt deposits in Stassfurt , Germany , and in Texas . The regular alternation of layers of unlike composition is easy to recognize , but to establish its annual origin is difficult , and so far conclusive evidence is not at hand for all laminated sediments suspected of being varves . It is a matter of great interest , however , for varves give us a means of establishing eventually a chronology based on years . A laminated sedimentary rock that is regarded as of varved origin is shown in Fig. 156 ; it is from an ancient lake deposit in Colorado . Each varve conSiSts of a pair of lamin , one composed largely of calcium carbonate and the other much higher in organic matter , and hence much darker . During the summer the lake warmed up , diminishing the solubility of carbon dioxide in it , and consequently abundant calcium carbonate was pre cipitated , and the production of floating microscopic organisms reached its annual maximum . The carbonate , being the heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and so most of it came to rest above the carbonate layer . By counting and measuring the supposed varves , it is estimated that about 6.5 million years were required to form the total deposit . Furthermore , the thickness of the couplets // shows a cyclic fluctuation averaging 11.5 years , which corresponds to the sun-spot cycle . This correspondence adds strength to the conclusion that the couplets , like tree-rings , are of annual origin ? are truly varves . Fossils . Fossils are the remains or imprints of animals or plants that were buried with the accumulating sediments ( Fig. 157 ) . Few organisms are preserved entire in the rocks ; only the hard parts , such as shells and bones , as a rule endure . These parts may be preserved unchanged , but the original material with which the organism built its hard parts is generally dissolved by circulating solutions and new material is put in the place of the removed substance so perfectly that the original form and details of structure are exactly preserved . Petrified wood is a well-known example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrently put in its place . The shells or other hard parts may even be wholly removed , and only an imprint or hollow scold be left in the rock . A natural mold of this sort may later become tilled by mineral matter , and this filling forms a copy or natural cast of the organic object . // As most fossils represent the animals and plants that were living when the sediments were forming , they throw much light on the conditions that prevailed during the deposition of the rocks in which they occur . They show , for example , whether the beds were laid down on the land or beneath the sea , since sediments laid down on the continents contain the remains of land plants , bones of land animals , or shells of river clams , whereas sediments laid down in the sea contain marine shells . The climate of the region at the time of deposition may be indicated also ; for example , fossils of tropical plants , such as palms , and animals , such as alligators , occur together in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferences based on fossils , however , must be checked against the inorganic evidence given by the rocks , for the living organisms were subject to evolution , whereas the rocks were formed in accordance with changeless laws . Mud Cracks . Soft muddy sediments exposed to the air and sunshine shrink and crack into characteristic polygonal blocks like those shown in Fig. 158 . The desiccation cracks thus formed are known as mud cracks . Further exposure bakes and hardens the blocks of mud . Later , during the dry season , wind-blown sand or silt may cover the blocks and fill the cracks with sediment that is coarser than the material of the mud-cracked layers . The form of the polygonal blocks will this become preserved even if the mud flat is again inundated . // After the deposits thus formed have been changed into beds of shale and sandstone , they may later be exposed by erosion , and the " fossil " mud cracks will be revealed on the bedding planes . Clearly , the conditions that favor the formation and preservation of mud cracks are ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the soft mud soon after its deposition ; therefore mud cracks and footprints commonly occur together in sedimentary rocks . These conditions favor also the preservation of raindrop im prints , which record a brief shower that fell while the mud flat was exposed to the atmosphere . The most favorable places for mud cracks to form are the floodplains of large rivers , the landward portions of large deltas , and the wide , flat shores of shallow lakes that shrink or disappear during the dry season . Marine tidal flats , in spite of their alternate wetting and drying , are unfavorable for the forming of mud cracks , because the mud has not sufficient time to dry thoroughly before the tide returns . Mud cracks form to a minor extent , however , at the upper margins of estuaries where the spring tides reach for only a few days in each month . As mud cracks can form only when the sediment is exposed to the air and allowed to dry and shrink , they are generally lacking in marine deposits . Ripple Marks . ' Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resulting deposit develops parallel ridges that resemble the ripples on the surface of a pool of water . These are ripple marks ( p. 163 ) . They are formed also by wind action on sand dunes ( p. 162 ) . Ripple marks made by currents migrate slowly with the current but retain their form , because the sand grains are rolled up the currentward side and fall down the leeward slope . Cur rent-formed ripple marks , therefore , are asymmetric , the currentward side having a gentle slope and the lee side a steeper slope . The direc tion of flow of the current is thus autographed in the form of the ripple marks ( Fig. 159 ) . Where oscillatory waves touch bottom , they too develop ripple marks by moving the bottom particles to-and-fro . Such oscillation ripple marks , in contrast to current-formed ripple marks , are symmetric ( Fig. 160 ) . Cross-Bedding . In many sedimentary rocks , especially in conglom erate and sandstone , the layers of certain beds are inclined at con siderable angles to the general planes of stratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure which is known as cross-bedding . ' It develops wherever sediment is being shifted by // currents in such a way as to be spilled over the front edge of the growing deposit : as the foreset edge of a delta , the front of a gravel bar , the front of a sand dune , or the front of a current ripple . The individual layers thus formed are diagonally inclined to the floor on which the deposit as a whole is growing upward ( Fig. 105 , p. 139 ) . The scale of the cross-bedding ranges from minute to very 1prge . In sand dunes the cross-bedding may extend across a stratum that is tens of feet thick , but in silts shifted by small ripples the cross-bedded strata are fractions of an inch thick . Since the diagonal lavers invariably slope downstream , the direction of the current , IJhat formed the cross-bedded deposits can be inferred . // Concretions . Some sedimentary rocks contain nodular bodies called concretions . These bodies differ in composition from the inclosing rock and are remarkably diversified in form : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring shaped , and still others are of // extraordinarily fantastic shapes . They range from a fraction of an inch to many feet in diameter . They are composed of one of the minor constituents of the inclosing rock ; thus , in chalk and limestone they consist of silica and comprise the well-known flint nodules ; in sandstone they consist of iron oxide or calcium carbonate ; and in shale , of calcium carbonate or iron sulphide . The bedding planes of the inclosing strata may persist through a concretion , a feature that proves that this particular concretion grew in the strata at a time after the strata had formed . Some large concretions , which have weathered out of the inclosing shale , are illustrated in Fig. 162 and show that the stratification passes through them . Many concretions contain at their centers a fossil that served as a nucleus around which the mineral matter composing the concretion was precipitated . Remarkable imprints of fern leaves , insects , and marine animals are obtained on splitting such concretions . COLORS OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS The color of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from that seen on freshly fractured surfaces . The colors of canyon and cliff are the results of weathering and are commonly but skin deep , but they enhance strikingly the picturesque qualities of such country as the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park . The colors of the weathered rocks are generally warmer and more brilliant than the intrinsic or proper colors of the unweathered rock as seen on fresh fracture . The color of a sedimentary rock is determined either by the color of its predominant constituent mineral , or by a small amount of pigment distributed through the rock . Carbonaceous matter and iron compounds are the chief pigments . They are present in relatively small amounts , from a fraction of 1 per cent to several per cent . The thickness of the coating of these pigments around the sedimentary grains is probably the chief factor in giving color to a rock , rather than the absolute amount of the pigment . Carbonaceous matter , or carbon for short , imparts dark-gray or black colors . On exposure to light the carbonaceous matter bleaches , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural exposures than they are on freshly broken surfaces . The carbon pigment originates from the alteration of organic matter that was buried with the sediment . The iron compounds , mainly ferric oxide and ferric hydrates , containing iron in its most highly oxidized form , are powerful coloring agents . The ferric hydrates give yellowish-red , brown , and maroon tones . The anhydrous ferric iron oxide IIc.O , , I imparts red tones . // A sandstone or shale containing a small percentage of the red iron pigment ( Fe2O3 ) is likely to be brick-red . In the presence of reducing agents ( carbonaceous matter , hydrogen sulphide ) ferric iron becomes " reduced " to the ferrous condition , in which state it forms much less conspicuously colored compounds . STRATIGRAPHIC RELATIONS Relative Age of Strata . The stratified rocks are formed by the superposition of layer upon layer of sediment , and therefore each layer or stratum is younger than the next below . The youngest stratum is at the top and the oldest is at the bottom of any pile of strata . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of geological events rest upon this self-evident principle . It is the first fundamental law of stratigraphy , which is that branch of geology dealing with the description , order , and position of the stratified rocks . Definition of a Formation . An assemblage of rock masses grouped into a unit that is convenient for description or mapping is termed a formation . A succession of strata that were deposited more or less continuously under essentially uniform conditions constitutes a sediinentary formation . A formation is usually given a geographical name based on the locality where it was first recognized , which is therefore called the type locality . If the formation consists chiefly of rock of one kind , that fact is commonly expressed in the given name , such as Bighorn dolomite , Utica shale , or Dakota sandstone . If , however , the formation is made up of rocks of various kinds ( for example , limestone and shale ) , it is given a geographical name only , as Kansas City formation . In addition to sedimentary formations , there are igneous formations , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An example to be described is the Columbia River basalt of the northwestern United States ( p. 227 ) . There are also metamorphic formations , e.g. , the Manhattan schist , the name of the formation on which much of the city of New York is built . A sedimentary formation generally contains certain distinctive fossils or a distinctive association of fossils . These remains of formerly living organisms are termed index or guide fossils , because they make it possible to trace the formation from the type locality across country , and even to recognize it wherever it occurs . In formations of geologically recent origin we find the remains of plants and animals of species now living . In the older formations remains of living species become progressively scarcer , and in the uncivil ( formations the remains are entirely those of organisms of // extinct species . A species that has become extinct never reappears in a younger formation . By determining the order of the superposed strata and also what distinctive remains of organisms are inclosed in them , a chronology of the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the fossil faunas and floras lived ( and therefore where they will be found in the strata ) and when they became extinct having been established , as was done first in Europe and America , these facts can be applied to determine the age and succession of strata anywhere , even in regions where crustal revolutions ( p. 252 ) have caused the strata to stand vertically or have overturned them . Stratigraphic Section at the Grand Canyon . The view from Hie rini of the ( . rand Uanyon of the ( lolorado gives an unrivaled panorama of sedimentary rocks ( Fig . I ( i ; i ) . The coloration , the horizontal // layering , and the thickness at once impress the observer . The lowest formation shown in the figure consists of strata of sandy shale and shaly sandstone more than 1000 feet thick ; above it is the Redwall limestone , whose massiveness causes it to crop out in 500-foot cliffs and to form some of the most striking scenery of the Canyon ; the third is a thick series of shales and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth is the Coconino sandstone , a prominent white sandstone formed in an ancient desert ; and the uppermost is the Kaibab limestone , so called because it forms the floor of the Kaibab Plateau in which the Canyon is incised . All these formations were laid down either in the sea or at sealevel . The formations revealed by the deep incision into the crust at the Grand Canyon total 4000 feet in thickness . They are still horizontal , although they have been lifted far above sealevel , and they are in undisturbed sequence . From the fossils in them we find that the lowermost formation was laid down near the beginning of Paleozoic time and the uppermost near the end of Paleozoic time ; translated into years , this means a span of 300 million years . From the fossils we learn further that the time during which the formations were deposited was only a fraction of this vast span of time . Therefore there are significant time breaks between some of the formations ; that is , there were long intervals when no sediments were deposited at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not represented by strata at the Grand Canyon , are represented elsewhere by great thicknesses of strata . Areal Extent of Sedimentary Formations . No geologic formation is worldwide in extent . Many sedimentary formations , however , are remarkably constant in composition and thickness over areas exceeding several thousand square miles . A notable example is the Dakota sandstone , which , cropping out along the Black Hills and the eastern front of tale Rocky Mountains , extends far eastward under the Great Plains ; and because of this continuity it transmits artesian water hundreds of miles east of the mountains . The most persistent strata consist of volcanic ash , for as we shall see ( p. 222 ) the fall of ash from a single great explosive eruption , like that of Tarnboro in 1815 , may form a continuous stratum that extends over an area as large as 1,000,000 square miles . Summary of the Sedimentary Rocks . The sedimentary rocks , except the tuffs and volcanic breccias , are made of materials that were derived from the erosional destruction of older rocks . Because the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sedimentary rocks have gone through several cycles of weathering , transport , sedi206 OUTLINES OF PHYSICAL GEOLOGY mentation , and consolidation to rock . That is , some sedimentary rocks have been formed as results of the destruction of still older sedimentary rocks ; but the ultimate sources of all the sediments were the igneous rocks . Only durable minerals survive this rigorous treatment , and therefore such minerals , represented pre-eminently by quartz , predominate in typical sedimentary rocks , such as sandstone . From sedimentary rocks much can be learned as to what rocks were exposed to weathering when the sediments were accumulating , the climate that prevailed , the means by which the sediments were transported , whether water , wind , or ice , and the conditions that existed at the site where the sediments were being deposited . They are thus of the utmost service in determining the geologic history of a region . Some , of course , like conglomerates give up their secrets more readily than others . Finally , the sedimentary rocks are the repositories of our most valuable mineral resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important commercially ? and this fact has been a powerful stimulus in recent years to the intensive study of these rocks in their scientific aspects . // VOLCANISM AND DEEP ? SEATED IGNEOUS ACTION VOLCANOES Vesuvius , overlooking the Bay of Naples , is the world 's best-known volcano . In times of quiet activity it discharges vast volumes of dense white clouds of steam , which issue from it with a rude rhythm : first come a succession of gigantic puffs , followed by a roaring expulsion , and so on , in continuous repetition . All this energy is drawn from beneath a densely populated area ! At times of heightened activity the crater becomes a lake of brilliantly incandescent lava , pieces of slag are hurled to a distance of many miles , earthquake shocks become violent , and flows of lava pour out and overwhelm unfortunate villages on the slopes of the mountain . During a major eruption all activity is intensified beyond all imagination . The concept of what a volcano is ? a steep conical mountain having at its top a crater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bombs , and lava flows ? takes its general outlines from Vesuvius . There are hundreds of active volcanoes the world over , however , and many of them diverge widely from this picture . The really essential feature of a volcano is an eruptive apparatus , generally a conduit that connects the exterior of the Earth with the interior . Volcanoes range in size from small cones that are hardly larger than a beehive to majestic peaks that are amongst the loftiest mountains on the globe . Many of the highest peaks of the Andes are volcanoes ; some of these are still active , as Cotopaxi in Ecuador , famed as the world 's highest active volcano , 19,600 feet in altitude ; but others have become extinct in the recent geologic past . The Andean volcanoes stand on a dissected platform of much older rocks , above which they tower 10,000 to 12,000 feet . Certain volcanoes in mid-ocean are much larger , however . The volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands rise from the floor of the Pacific Ocean at depths of 14,000 to 18,000 feet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they attain a total height of 30,000 feet . Phases of Volcanic Activity . Materials of three kinds are ejected from volcanic vents : gases , liquid lava , and solid material in the form of fragments . The character of a volcanic eruption depends largely on 207 // the proportions in which these three materials are being ejected . Ac-cording to the predominant material that it is erupting , a volcano is said to be in a particular phase of activity . For some volcanoes , notably Vesuvius , definite cycles of activity are recognized . Each cycle begins with a phase of increasing emission of gases ; this is fol lowed by the second phase , the discharge of lava , ending with copious outflow of lava from the slopes ; and the final phase consists of the ejection of fragmental material . A phase of activity may vary enormously in intensity during the course of an eruption or in successive eruptions , as measured by the violence of explosions or by the quantity of material ejected . Lava-emitting Phase of Activity . Volcanoes in this phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explosive es-cape of gases and the ejection of fragmental material . The lava thus discharged is very hot , and hence highly liquid . More or less gas con stantly escapes from it but without explosive violence . Activity of this kind is particularly well exemplified in Hawaii . The island of Hawaii is an immense mass of basaltic lavas crowned by five great volcanoes , of which Mauna Loa ( 13,700 feet high ) and Kilauea ( 4000 feet high ) are active . Mauna Loa is the vastest of existing volcanoes . It also surpasses all others in the magnitude of its eruptions . Marvelously spectacular are the great columns of white-hot molten lava that at times play as mighty fire-fountains hundreds of feet high . As the fountains are often nearly continuous along the eruptive fissure , they form a veritable curtain of fire . The molten lavas of Mauna Loa generally issue from fissures in its flanks rather than through the crater rim , and sometimes they issue below sealevel . On the eastern slope of Mauna Loa , 22 miles from its top and 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oval depression , 9 miles in circumference , shut in except on the south by vertical cliffs which reach a height of 450 feet . This depressed area is often called Kilauea 's " crater " but is in reality a caldera ( p. 222 ) . In the floor of the de pression is Halemaumau , the " Everlasting House of Fire , " a pit which before 1924 was 1300 feet across and contained a seething lake of liquid basalt . The temperature of the lava ranged from 1000 ? to 1200 ? C. , ' the higher temperatures prevailing at times of increased activity . In 1924 the lava column in the pit of Halemaumau suddenly dropped 700 feet , and this subsidence was followed by great explosions , the first ex-plosive eruption since 1790 . Avalanching from the sides of Halemau mau began and enlarged the pit , so that it became 3000 by 3400 feet // across and 1340 feet deep . After the eruption the pit began to fill again with molten lava , but up to the year 1940 the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor of the " crater " of Kilauea . The explosive outburst of 1924 , after an uninterrupted period of 134 years of quiet extrusion , shows that even basaltic volcanoes , which normally emit the most fluent of lavas , may on occasions become violently explosive . The sudden influx of ground water into the volcanic pipe , as undoubtedly occurred in 1924 as the result of the lava column in the pipe dropping abruptly to great depth , generated immense quantities of steam and caused the spectacular features of an explosive eruption ( Fig. 164 ) . Pelean Phase . The phase of volcanic activity termed pelean is probably the most remarkable of all . The volcano of Mont Pelee on the island of Martinique in the West Indies , after small premonitory symptoms , began in May , 1902 , to erupt in a series of violent explosions ; it had been in repose since 1851 , and had then been only feebly eruptive . No lava was now poured out but on the morning of May 8 an enormous dense black cloud of superheated steam heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flank of the mountain and sped down its slope to the sea , at a rate of more than a mile a minute . The cloud swept through the town of St. Pierre , 5 miles from its point of origin , and instantaneously destroyed the town and its inhabitants and those who in the previous days had fled to it for safety . Some 28,000 people were killed within a few seconds ; only two persons are known to have escaped alive . For many months Mont Pelee continued at irregular intervals to eject similar clouds , one of which is shown in Fig. 165 as it arrived at the sea . Not till well beyond 1905 was the eruption finally over . On September 16 , 1929 , strong explosions suddenly broke out on the smnmit of Mont Pelee . Next day , after this preliminary eruption , not 30 people remained in St. Pierre . In mid-November pelean clouds began to be ejected . Hundreds were emitted , differing enormously in intensity , but none attained the terrific destructiveness of those of the earlier eruption . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been too short to build up the tremendous gas pressure t hat obtained in 1902 . The great eruption of Pelee in 1902 directed attention to a phenomtato previously unrecognized . The remarkable clouds ejected are now called pelean clouds . The extraordinary features of a pelean cloud are : it is emitted as a horizontal blast from beneath a lava plug in the
