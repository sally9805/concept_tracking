After ten days of Christian conference and patient protocol at Johnstown , Pa. , 700 delegates from two churches last week went home as delegates from one . The United Brethren and the Evangelical Church had joined to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church-13th largest Protestant denomination in the U.S.* <P> The churches had shared an almost identical background and a history of unusually friendly relations , but their union had taken a long time . United Brethren and Evangelical representatives first gathered to talk it over in 1816 ; it was 1933 before they really got down to business . <P> Ecumenical Century . The new merger underscored a glacially slow but unmistakable trend in sect-ridden U.S. Protestantism . During the late 18th and first half of the 19th Centuries , Christianity in America tended to spatter in sectarian fragments like a spoonful of quicksilver dropped suddenly on marble . Now , in the 20th Century , U.S. Christians have begun to coalesce on their common Christian ground . <P> Firm foundations for Protestantism 's new trend were laid at the Oxford and Edinburgh conferences of 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives in 400 years . In 1939 the three major denominations of U.S. Methodism merged into one church ; in 1940 the Evangelical Synod of North America and the Reformed Church officially united . In 1942 the American and United Lutheran churches recognized a " fellowship of pulpit and altar , " stopped just short of organic union . Recently the U.S. Quakers healed their 119-year-old Hicksite-Orthodox schism ( TIME , Nov. 18 ) . Negotiations are currently under way between Northern and Southern Presbyterians . <P> Now Is the Time . Only the much-discussed merger of Episcopalians and Presbyterians seemed as far off as ever ( TIME , Sept. 23 ) . But in last week 's Christian Century , Methodist Pastor C. Stanley Lowell of Dover , Del. , proposed a new and more promising church wedding for the Episcopalians . Wrote he : <P> " The next step in church union should be a merger of the Methodist and Protestant Episcopal churches . This merger would involve no violation of the fundamental principles of either church . <P> " It is logical , possible and desirable . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " These two communions have a common origin , common articles of religion , a comparable form of government . That is a good deal . We could hardly ask for more as a basis of union . Some nine years ago , at the same time that the Episcopalians made overtures to the Presbyterian Church , a similar invitation was extended to the Methodists . Since the three branches of Methodism were busy consummating their own union , it seemed wise to postpone action . . . . But now that the Methodists are happily unified there can be no further reason for delay . . . . <P> " Obviously the main issue to be negotiated . . . is the succession . The validity of Methodist orders is denied by Anglicans , just as the validity of Anglican orders is denied by Roman Catholics . . . . Yet the Methodist movement has been used of God and God has been in it . There is a certain kind of validity here that is not easily gainsaid . . . . <P> " Let the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissions be established and the necessary spadework proceed . Now is the time .
