COMMUNISTS <P> The news from northern Greece was the best that gloomy Athens had heard for a long time . It was not a military victory for the government ; it was a political crisis in the camp of the enemy . The rebel radio announced that General Markos Vafiades ( TIME , April 5 ) , the wiry , hairy soldier who had long commanded the northern Communists , had been " seriously ill " for months and had been relieved of his duties . <P> A government intelligence officer remarked that Markos ' affliction was , no doubt , " a small round hole in the head . " Although it seemed most probable that he had been executed by his fellow Communists , there was a slight possibility that he might have escaped into Yugoslavia . It made no difference . In one way or another , Markos had been removed from the scene . <P> The implications were bigger than the mere loss to the Communists of a valuable commander . Markos , it appeared , had run afoul of Moscow , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts with Yugoslavia after Tito 's break with the Cominform . Like Tito , Markos had fought his own battle for power , and having achieved it , he liked to run things his own way . As a soldier , he believed that his army needed the crossing points on the Yugoslav border , and the training and supply bases behind it . For a while , he made this view prevail . The Cominform , however , had a blindly loyal follower in Moscow-trained Nicholas Zachariades , secretary general of the Greek Communist Party . At a recent meeting of Cominform leaders in Sofia , Politician Zachariades was told to get rid of Soldier Markos . It was reported that several of Markos ' loyal lieutenants had been purged along with him. * <P> Athens had long suspected that something was going to happen to headstrong Markos . Nearly a year ago , government intelligence officers got hold of a letter purported to have been written by Markos to Zachariades , in which he criticized not only the Balkan satellites but Moscow itself . <P> Last month the Yugoslavs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across which men , arms and supplies had once freely flowed . If Markos was right-that the Albanian and Bulgarian backstops were not enough for Communist victory in Greece-then the tide of battle , which lately has gone against Athens , may soon turn the other way . <P> * Last autumn , Yugoslavia 's noisy Deputy Foreign Minister Alfes Bebler said to TIME Correspondent Robert Low : " There 's a difference between those of us who have fought for power and those who have had it handed to them on a platter by the Red army . If you have fought , you have different ideas and feelings about your rights . I think the Soviets will have to face this same problem with Mao Tse-tung in China , and perhaps with Markos in Greece .
