Which is the biggest U.S. aircraft producer ? Last week such a spate of facts , figures &; claims hit newspaper headlines that even airmen were baffled . <P> &gt; Tom Girdler 's Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corp . proudly announced that it is the " world 's largest producer of airplanes . " In 1943 , it claimed to have delivered more planes " by weight and number " than any other company . <P> &gt; Douglas Aircraft proudly announced that it had " set a new world 's record " in 1943 in the delivery of combat planes . In the current year , it predicted , it will be far ahead of any other producer in " weight and numbers . " <P> &gt; Grumman Aircraft proudly announced that it has the " largest output in the world of combat planes " in any single plant . <P> On the basis of WPB figures , Consolidated was entitled to its claim . It had turned out 126,000,000 pounds of aircraft , compared to 115,000,000 for Douglas . But Douglas also had an argument . Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-to-build combat ships . Furthermore , Consolidated had merged with Vultee and Stinson in ' 43 , lumped all production . <P> WPB politely declined to be drawn into the argument . It refused to designate any company as " biggest , " emphasized that comparisons , either in weight or number , are unfair . Reason : a complicated Flying Fortress is more difficult to build than a heavier transport , counts no more , numerically , than a " flying jeep . " No figures could take into consideration many an other factor , such as design changes , new models , experimentation . But of one thing WPB was proudly certain : the high-geared U.S. aircraft industry will build more than 100,000 planes this year , compared to 85,946 in 1943.
