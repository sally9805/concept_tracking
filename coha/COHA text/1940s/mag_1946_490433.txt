IT took a Westchester County real-estate deal to get Americans really worked up about the U.N.O . The realization that American homes were actually involved in the thing came as a great surprise . " It ai n't democratic ! " shouted a citizen of North Castle , hurl  --  ing in three words the most constructive criticism that has yet been aimed at the new organization . The people of Westchester , peace-loving by nature , had a feeling they had n't been consulted in a matter that concerned them closely . The fact that they are n't being con  --  sulted in certain other U.N.O . matters ? matters on which hangs the fate of every home in every land  --  has prob  --  ably not even yet occurred to many . But it will in time , as the debates in the Security Council become increasingly violent and the shadow of the veto lengthens on the living-room rug .

Look to the Charter , everybody , while you still have a home ! ik QUESTION that keeps bobbing up is whether it is feasible to es  --  tablish a world capital until you have a world government . This question , in  --  directly , bothered some Westchester people , too . One of them wrote the Thnes questioning the whole idea of bringing furriners here to our midst . It 's a better question than it seems , on the face of it . It is a question to which a group of young federalists , believers in government , have been addressing their minds over the past weekend in Concord , Massachusetts .

WE note that the new Packard taxicab , two feet shorter than the prewar cab , failed to pass the city 's test and was refused a license . This serves Packard right for trying to buck prog  --  ress . A shorter cab is a hit of architec  --  tural heresy . Everybody knows that what this town needs is longer and lower taxicabs . Much longer and much lower . What do designers think we are , anyway  --  a race of people almost six feet tall , living on a small island ? IT would appear that the preference of veterans is for a chicken farm . More veterans want to raise chickens than want to do anything else . This is an interesting condition in a country whose No. 1 best-seller on the non  --  fiction list is a hook blasting the daylights out of egg farming .

A man who can stand up under the pressing demands of ten thousand chickens is , in our opinion , not only a good man , he is a fabulous one . E learned the other day that the staff of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , bankers , is making a private collection of clothing to be sent to the staff of the Paris branch . With this news , the war gains a new dimension in our minds . The familiar figure of the shivering waif  --  a child of no particular national ity and with no banking connections ? has long been the conventional symbol of postwar society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varia tion . The shivering Morgan bank as sistant , awaiting a hand-me-down top coat from his associates in steam-heated America , suggests that war has pene trated areas where it was never intended to penetrate by those who felt that they always had the thing in hand . A cold Morgan is somehow more ominous than a cold child . Next time , war can he counted on to reach the whole way into human life , and the employees of the Home Office , along with everybody else , will face a winter of cold . Just where that winter 's clothing drive will originate is a little hard to say . WE had lunch last Friday with Jay Wesley Jacobs , the artist who painted the first official portrait of President Truman . Up to last sum  --  mer , the President , a man of simple tastes , had never sat for anything more stylish than a photograph . Jacobs , who was born in Birmingham , Alabama , is a courtly man in his forties and looks like a career diplomat ; that is , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look  --  smooth and gentle and slightly sinister . This resemblance is probably due less to Birmingham than to the fact that he spent some time studying at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris . " My mother paint  --  ed a little , " he told us , " but my father was a banker , and he wanted me to get into something with dignity . I did n't mind learning to be a diplomat until the day when a lot of other students and I were called on to hold ribbons at a re  --  ception for the President of France the sort of thing debutantes might do over here . I decided I 'd better get the hell out of all that before they made a flower girl of me . I moved over to the painting side of the family and signed up at the Beaux-Arts . I 've always been rather bashful , but I like people and I figured that portrait painting would be a fine way to get to know them . " Jacobs returned to the United States in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits among New York , Alabama , and , more recently , Washington . " I do six to eight portraits a year , " he said . " That 's about all an artist can do if he wants to do them well . Unfortunately , my friends do n't understand this . They get very crotchety because I wo n't drop my work and whip up a little something for them . " Demonstrating that Jacobs pert had builded better than he knew , Jacobs flu charges from $2,500 to $5,000 for a portrait , depending upon what the traffic will bear . He received $3,000 for the Truman portrait , which was commissioned by someone whom Jacobs described as " an old friend of the Truman family . " Other than the President , Jacobs ' subjects have been mainly industrial or social big shots , all of them fine risks at any bank . " I guess I just naturally like doing portraits for directors ' rooms and that sort of thing , " Jacobs said . " I 've also done a lot of the horsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example . I wanted to get the idea across that she was the horsy type . I think I got it in  --  to her face . She seemed pleased with it . " Jacobs likes painting men better than women , because men do n't object to having lines in their faces . " Women 's portraits always look like hell in five years , " he said . " They change their hairdo , and the style of their clothes changes , and bang ! down comes the portrait from the wall . " Jacobs considers Truman one of the best subjects who ever sat for him . " He really comes from a fine old famili , you know , " Jacobs said . " One of his an  --  cestors is hanging in the White House and Mrs. Truman knows a lot of people I know in Birmingham . " The actual painting was done in the Cabinet Room , with the President sitting on a soap box . " He was very good , " Jacobs told us . " I had to pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once or twice he wore the wrong glasses , but he was nice about going back for the right pair . Unlike a good many sub  --  jects , the President never tried to peek at my work . Once , going to get his glasses , he walked right in front of the painting , but he did n't even turn his head . He 's a man of iron will . " There were twelve sittings in all , and they lasted from a half to three-quarters of an hour apiece Jacobs likes to keep his subjects talking as he paints them , because he feels that it gives them a look of animation . The Truman sittings started just before the San Francisco Conference and were postponed for a few weeks after V-J Day . The Presi  --  dent was suitably animated throughout . When Jacobs finished the portrait , he took it to Mrs. Truman . She looked at it and said , " Well , I hate to see it go to the Senate . " ( It 's going to be hung there . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it later and said that it flattered him . His only complaint was that one sleeve of his coat looked as if it had been pressed . " No well-dressed man ever has his coat sleeves creased , " Jacobs said , " and of course I understood the President 's feelings perfectly . I fixed it up . " ? INCIDENTAL .

" " Make a swell code , " she remarked professionally to her com  --  panion . " I hope this jerk talks about poison , " the other said , referring thus cavalierly to the guest expert of the eve  --  ning , Dr. Thomas A. Gonzales , Med  --  ical Examiner of New York City . " I 've got a doozer of an idea about cyanide . " " Cyanide is old hat , " said her friend . " Can you kill anyone with radar ? " a nearby male mystery writer asked us .

He pointed out Maxwell Grant ( alias Walter Gib  --  son ) , the creator of The Shadow , among those present , and one-half of Ellery Queen ( alias Manfred Lee ) .

You want to be sure not to use technical information unless it 's correct . " A few listeners fidgeted .

" He did n't say a word about poison . I might as well have staved home and curled up with a medical text  --  book . " We worked our way to the back of the room , where Dr. Gonzales was swapping crime anecdotes with Helen Reilly , a mystery-writing sister of John Kieran . " That 's a swell one , " we heard him say . " Wait till I tell the boys that one . That 'll kill ' em .

" Enter Evans AYOUNG lady just topping off her first year in the big city has referred to us a letter she has received from her mother in Ohio . " Dear Eliza  --  beth , " it begins . " My , how busy you sound ! You must remember to keep well bundled up in this cold weather . You wrote in your last letter that you had been to see ' Hamlet ' with Maurice Evans . I do n't recall your having men  --  tioned his name before . I hope he is a nice boy and that you had a real nice Custom for the Masses THREADING our way through traffic jams of tired jalopies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago to have a talk with Howard A. Darrin , de  --  signer of the pair of models with which Kaiser and Frazer expect to cut in on Chrysler , Ford , and General Motors . We found him to be a well-set-up man in his late forties , who reminded us vaguely of Jean Gahin . He told us right off that he had tried to make the Kaiser-Frazer cars something more than functional and something less than ostentatious . " The body of a car , " he said , " needs to have style and good taste , like a properly cut suit of clothes . All this damned chromium they fancy so much in Detroit just makes cars look cheap . I wish car designing here were as much fun as it used to be in Paris . Over there you were regarded as an artist and you designed a car body for a patron as a painter does a portrait . " We asked Darrin , who is a native New Yorker , how he happened to get into chi- designing in France . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We waved him on amiably and he told us that he has been building bodies for automobiles ever since 1922 . He took a roundabout way to get into the business . Before the first World War , he worked for West  --  inghouse and studied engineering at night . When the war came , he joined the French Air Force , for which he flew a hundred and ten missions . " I was all hopped up about aviation , " he said , " so much so that when the fighting was over I started the first airline in the United States . It was called Aero , Ltd. , and its rolling stock was made up of surplus Army planes flown by demobilized pi  --  lots . We made one run from New York to Miami in a neat fifteen hours , but even so , Aero , Ltd. , was n't appreciated and it folded . " The demise of Aero did n't leave Mr. Darrin with nothing to do . He had a pal named Thomas Hibbard working for Brewster , the coachbuilders , who felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have Darrin as his part  --  ner . They formed a company to build custom-made bodies for automobiles and christened it LeBaron , which they figured sounded fancy . LeBaron did all right , but presently Darrin and Hib ? bard sold out to Briggs , and , with a new associate named Fernandez , Darrin set up shop in Paris , where he designed bodies elegant enough to grace the chas  --  sis of Minervas , Hispano-Suizas , and Isotta Fraschinis . They turned out lordly , tailor-made products , some of which cost as much as $25,000 . They produced a Duesenberg convertible equipped , as Darrin put it , " with every  --  thing but a shower , " for Alfonso of Spain ; an extra-large town car with a Minerva chassis for Marie of Ru  --  mania ; and a Rolls-Royce converti  --  ble for Lord Louis Mountbatten . Where these sumptuous vehicles are nowadays , he has no idea , but he hopes that their present owners were n't re  --  duced to running them on charcoal . " It would have played hell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , " to have had a big iron cylinder strapped on behind . " Since 1937 , Darrin has been operat  --  ing the Darrin Body Company in southern California , specializing in jobs for the Hollywood colony . He 's made bodies on various substantial chassis for the Countess di Frasso , Clark Gable , and Errol Flynn , for instance . Occa  --  sionally one of his productions is seen sweeping through an opulent scene in some movie , giving common people a hint of the magnificence of life out there . We were curious to know whether Darrin regarded his Kaiser-Frazer operations as a comedown . " My God , no ! " he said . " Even in my salad days in Paris I was busy on the Citroen and over here I 've been consulting en  --  gineer , at one time or another , for Gen  --  eral Motors , Dodge , Studebaker , and Stutz . I helped style the Packard Clip  --  per , and once worked for Armstrong Siddeley in England . That was the pleasantest job I ever had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't change much from season to season , and about all I did the first year I was there was to make a slight change in the hubcaps . The directors were so grateful that they voted me a contract for another ' ear . " Darrin figures that it takes him about twenty-five minutes to cook up a design for a car but that he earns his money in any mass-production proposition , be  --  cause he has to spend so much time bat  --  tling engineers and cost experts . " Both those cars we had on exhibit at the IVal  --  dorf were completely handmade , " he told us , " and I made a special trip to Willow Run to do a little hammering on them myself . " Homesick C0141ING up behind a couple of sailors an the wooden platform overlooking the abyss that is to be Best 's , an agent of ours heard one of them say , in an unmistakable Maine accent , " Wish my old dad could see this .

" Street 's learned a lot since 1929 , when our daily average for the year was five million shares , " an Exchange representative told us . " The boys are sober , God-fearing gentlemen nowadays . Every  --  where you used to go on the floor there would be the hotfoot or a cup of water down the back , but now they 've seen the folly of their ways . " He led us to the gallery above the trading floor and said , " If you remember the old days  --  I do n't mean the old , old days  --  there used to be just a few hundred guys wan  --  dering around holding pieces of paper in their two fingers , as if they did n't know whether to throw them away or not .

" We looked , and the ticker-tape figures projected on the screens at the four corners of the room did seem to he rack  --  eting along at a faster clip than during our last visit . Brokers and clerks were taking the corners of the fifteen horse  --  shoe-shaped trading posts at a steady 6 or 8 M.P.H. , and nobody was sitting down except a little page girl in a blue serge uniform marked " N.Y.S.E. , " who was massaging a bobby-sexed foot ( hers ) .

" First we did n't know what the enemy was go  --  ing to do and then we did n't know what the government was going to do . " It was the slimmest year since 1914 , when the Exchange was shut down altogether for four months . Worst day 's busi  --  ness since 1914 was May 21 , 1940 ? 130,000 shares .
