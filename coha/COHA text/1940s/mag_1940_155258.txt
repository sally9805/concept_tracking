One man in 20 is color-blind in greater or lesser degree and for that reason ineligible for training as an Army Air Corps pilot or observer . Last week the Air Corps 's School of Flight Medicine reported an interesting incident . <P> In a plane at Fort Sill , Okla. early this summer , an Air Corps observer was able to spot only ten of 40 camouflaged artillery fieldpieces on the ground . An observer of the Field Artillery in a plane spotted all 40 and accurately plotted their positions on his map . The explanation : the artilleryman , selected under less rigorous examination than the Air Corps man , was colorblind . Camouflage , designed to deceive the normal eye , fooled him not a whit . <P> Last week , at the School of Flight Medicine , clerks combed the files preparing a list of candidates rejected for color blindness . But the Air Corps still wants no color-blind pilots . A pilot must be able to distinguish between colors in Very signals , field lights , etc. , where a mistake would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
