( See Cover ) <P> Anywhere but in a democracy , the Senate 's irreverent Truman Committee would be fair game for liquidation . In a perfect state , free from butterfingers and human frailty , it would be unnecessary . In the U.S. , democratic but far from perfect , the Truman Committee this week celebrated its second successful birthday as one of the most useful Government agencies of World War II . <P> Had they had time , its ten members might have toasted their accomplishments all night . They had served as watchdog , spotlight , conscience and spark plug to the economic war-behind-the-lines . They had prodded Commerce Secretary Jesse Jones into building synthetic-rubber plants , bludgeoned the President into killing off doddering old SPAB and setting up WPB . <P> They had called the turn on raw-materials shortages , had laid down the facts of the rubber famine four months before the famed Baruch report . One single investigation , of graft and waste in Army camp building , had saved the U.S. $250,000,000 ( according to the Army 's own Lieut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into billions , partly because of what their agents had ferreted out in the sprawling war program , partly because their hooting curiosity was a great deterrent to waste . <P> The Truman Committee was too busy to celebrate . In its 16th month of war , the U.S. had still not digested some of war 's first readers . The first annual Truman report , with its shocking evidence of all-around bungling ( TIME , Jan. 26 , 1942 ) , had not spelled the end of bungling . This week the Committee worked on its second annual report , which would have to recite much the same story , chastise many of the same men , pose some of the same old problems . How big should the Army be ? How could the manpower tangle be solved ? Where would the nation get its food this year ? What was wrong with WPB ? <P> Over these basic questions , which the Truman Committee , on behalf of all American citizens , had hoped would be solved two years ago , the committee still sweated , glowed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bigger the U.S. arsenal grew , the more important the Truman Committee became . As the arsenal turned into a modern-day Great Pyramid , most Washington officials still lugged just one stone , and many carried it in the wrong direction . <P> The closest thing yet to a domestic high command was the Truman Committee . Its members had no power to act or order . But , using Congress 's old prerogative to look , criticize and recommend , they had focused the strength of public opinion on the men who had the power . They had a fund of only $200,000 ( some still unspent ) only twelve investigators , 18 clerks and stenographers . But it was an obscure war plant that had never been visited by the committee . Its members had heard hundreds of witnesses , taken 4,000,000 words of testimony . With battle-royal impartiality , they had given thick ears and red faces to Cabinet members , war agency heads , generals , admirals , big businessmen , little businessmen , labor leaders .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
