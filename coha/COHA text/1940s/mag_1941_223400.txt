Morgan Stanley &; Co . Inc. , most influential of all U.S. investment bankers , last week decided to enter the brokerage business as well . First step will be to drop the " Inc. , " set up a partnership before year 's end . Then it plans to join the New York Stock Exchange ( barred to corporations ) , open retailing departments , hire customers ' men , fit out a big board room . <P> Morgan Stanley drops its Inc. less than two years after its foster parent J. P. Morgan &; Co. added one ( TIME , Feb. 26 , 1940 ) . J. P. Morgan incorporated to conserve the partners ' funds against estate taxes , etc. , and to enter the profitable trust-company field . Morgan Stanley enters a field that can barely sustain those already in it . But Morgan Stanley has a tax reason too : partnerships avoid the 31% corporation income tax .
