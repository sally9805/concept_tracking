Edward Asbury O'Neal III is no dirt farmer . A jovial man with a Southern planter 's courtliness , he likes good clothes , good living and glittery functions . He habitually has two bourbon toddies before dinner and is equally at ease wielding a salad fork or a gavel ( " Let 's us folks give that gennaman from Miss'ippi a chance to say what 's botherin ' ' im " ) . <P> Yet Ed O'Neal , tough and profane as well as courtly , has been the most powerful spokesman U.S. farmers have ever had . All during the Roosevelt years , he-more than any other man-shaped U.S. farm policy . In his heyday as president of the rich American Farm Bureau Federation ( membership : 1,275,000 ) , he had no peer as a Washington lobbyist . He knew when to cajole , when to burst into anger , when to be imperious , when to recite statistics , when to tell a droll story . The Agricultural Adjustment Act was the result of Ed O'Neal 's ideas . He " nominated " Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Plow the little pigs under " ) , persistently pushed parity payments onward &; upward . <P> That Red Soil . But lately Ed O'Neal has slowed down . At 72 , his hands and his head shake with palsy . He has difficulty lighting his Dunhill pipe . Last week , at the Farm Bureau 's 29th meeting in Chicago , Ed O'Neal finally stepped down from the $15,000-a-year office he had held since 1931 . <P> Soon , Ed will return to his 1,800-acre cotton and wheat farm near Florence , Ala. , where he was born . " I shore'n hell love that red soil , " said Ed . " I 'm too old to handle a team of mules the way I used to . But I been fixin ' up the little old house , and I guess I 'll just go there and kind of take it easy . " <P> Right Bower . As Ed 's successor , the convention picked shaggy-browed Allan Kline , 52 , of Iowa , who has long been Ed 's right bower and the Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student of philosophy , economics and history , Kline is a hog farmer with a distaste for colloquialisms . He has a town house in Des Moines and a farm in Benton County which boasts a swimming pool , tennis court , and gaited horses . He is an independent Republican . Deliberate and shrewd , Kline believes in a relatively low level of parity and a thriving foreign trade as the basis for continued farm prosperity . <P> As the delegates sang " Ioway , that 's where the tall corn grows , " Allan Kline climbed the platform and slung an arm around old Ed O'Neal . Ed 's eyes were slightly moist . To photographers , he said : " You all be careful not to catch mah false teeth ! " Far back in the crowded ballroom , one of the delegates yelled : " So long , Ed ! " Ed crackled , and waved .
