THE WORLD Is A WEDDING ( 196 pp. ) - Delmore Schwartz-New Directions ( $2.75 ) . <P> These quiet stories of middle-class Jewish families in New York may seem at first almost too transparently told . But most readers will soon recognize the art in the telling , the overtones of irony and pathos produced by the right clichs , in the right places . With these stories Poet Delmore Schwartz should take his place among the dozen or so most accomplished young U.S. writers ( he is 34 ) . <P> A kind of studied coyness and poeticism occasionally flaws a prose that is otherwise like a sheet of plate glass . But the two longest pieces ( the title story and one called The Child Is the Meaning of <P> This Life ) will suffer no disgrace by comparison with Chekhov or Stendhal for a hurting sense of human relationships . <P> The writer is aware , as most of his characters are not , of the depth of mystery that lies behind the sorrow-as behind the pride-of the intellectual Jew . <P> Alienated from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion , and painfully disabused about each other , the characters of his stories seem brought to bay in the great supercivilized bewilderment of New York City . Often they are presented in a dimension of depth , two or three generations rapidly telescoping into one terrifying puzzle of defeated hopes , rancor and self-ignorance . The types recur : the intense , ambitious , unimaginative older son who is the pride of the family and the one whom death cuts down ; the hardworking , kind elder sister ; the young girl , liberated and " radical " ; the pampered shy and idle younger son ; and the down-to-earth , eternally anxious , adoring mother who endures.
