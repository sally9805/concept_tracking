THE GREAT CRUSADE-Gustav Regler - Longmans , Green ( $2.50 ) . <P> In 1936 the first International Brigades marched into the Spanish Civil War , shouting : Spain is the grave of fascism . It turned out to be the grave of most of the Internationals . They had almost no arms , often no rations . They were refugees from Germany and Italy , workingmen and intellectuals from France and Belgium , men without identification papers , passports , even names . Most of them were Communists , but there were few Russians among them . They believed they were fighting to save democracy from fascism . In their political innocence and lack of military equipment , they were determined , if necessary , to make a living barrier of their bodies to keep Franco 's Moors out of Madrid . They did . Most of them were killed . Their successors , chiefly Americans , were later terribly routed at Teruel ; Alvah Bessie described their extermination in a powerful book , Men in Battle . But until Gustav Regler published The Great Crusade this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described the heroic period of the International Brigades , the defense of Madrid . <P> The book is history in novel form-the story of the first great military action in the war against fascism of which the Battle of Britain is the latest . It is built up around the battles that the Internationals fought to save Madrid-University City , Boadilla del Monte , the Arganda Bridge , Guadalajara where they routed Mussolini 's troops . It is written in great chunks in which the rabble armies struggle to advance a mile , are thrown back ten , somehow hold on ; in which their little human components hope , despair , suffer , exult , sometimes betray , always fight to stay alive , to kill before they are killed . <P> No one was in a better position to write such a book than Gustav Regler . A leftish German migr writer , Regler was one of scores of salon Bolsheviki who , drawn like flies by the smell of blood , swarmed down on Spain in 1936 . There he ran into his great &; good friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Marxist faith in matters esthetic for Linkskurve ( Left Curve ) , the most influential German Marxist literary magazine . In Spain Lukacz ( General Paul in The Great Crusade ) was general of the Eleventh and Twelfth International Brigades . He quickly made Author Regler ( Albert in The Great Crusade ) his political commissar . <P> Said General Paul : " A commissar is a maid of all work , a democratic priest , an army doctor with his fingers always on the pulse of the Brigade . " More significantly he added : " You are my third eye . "
