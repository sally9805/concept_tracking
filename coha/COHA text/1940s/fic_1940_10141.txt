MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " I was only teasing Miss Yates . She has a beau in New York  --  official and important . I like to rag her about being hand and glove with him in crime detection . I do n't really know that anythinghappened aboard yesterday , though it is going around the ship that someone died . Probably heart failure during the storm . What a storm ! " Mrs Richmond seemed satisfied . She called their attention to a ship on the horizon and commented immediately afterward on the beauty of the storm-washed day . " I find everything betteron sea . I am what you call a very good sailor . Not one minuteof seasickness yesterday , but in the storm I wrenched my shoulder . . . I was thrown in my cabin when those big waves came . So I remained below last night . You do not mind that I have put myself , unasked , at your table ? " Susan and Lucinda politely disclaimed any such a thought and conversation became desultory . Presently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassured Lucinda that she would make a five o'clock appointment for her if the manicuristwere good and departed , leaving Ethan and Carleton still in shuffleboard conflict , Mrs Richmond and Lucinda leaning over the rail . CHAPTER SEVENTHE MANICURIST was very young looking , not twenty , Susan suspected . On request , she said her name was Hazel Hefflebowen . She had big brown eyes , milky skin , dextrous fingers and little to say . As a second coat of liquid polish was being applied Susan remarked that Mrs Van Weck would like a manicurein the late afternoon . " Mrs Van Weck ? " repeated the manicurist and made her first clumsy motion , allowing a sizable coral globule to trickle off onto one of Susan 's fingers . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 41 " Yes . Do you know her ? " asked Susan , giving the girl a quick look . " Oh no . No  --  that is , I used to have a customer of that name . A gentleman , I think it was . " The fingers removing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's husband perhaps , " commented Susan dryly . " But surely you have n't been working long  --  a child like you . " " I 'm twenty-three . " " I should n't have taken you for a day over eighteen or nine-teen . " " I 've been working since I was sixteen . Four years at the Hotel Eden and then for three years in the Alma Peters ' salon . " Again Susan looked at her sharply . " Did you know Miss Peters well ? " " Oh no . We girls never saw her . There was a manager over us . But Miss Peters was very kind to me . I have chronic sinus trouble . The manager told her , I guess , and she thought salt air might be good for me . It was her recommendation that got me this job on the Island . She 's aboard too . Is n't it exciting  --  an awfully important person like her ? " " You 'll like Mrs Van Weck , " Susan said , to change the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I saw a lady on this corridor with a dog . " " Yes , a prize winner . Cocker spaniel . Very elegant dog . " " Is he  --  is he cross ? " Susan laughed . " My goodness , no . Only famous . You need have no fears that Oscar II will nip you . " The manicurist looked relieved . " I was bitten once by a dog , " she explained without elaboration ; and , finishing the last stroke of lacquer , gathered up her equipment . At the door she said : " I will tell them to send me to Mrs Van Weck at five . " When she had gone Susan inspected her manicure and thought : " It seems to me everybody I meet on this ship is slightly cuckoo . Personally , I should n't mind something definite42 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITlike a dog phobia . Indefinite premonitions are too nerve rack-ing . " At dinner time Lucinda said to her husband : " Ethan , you 're a disgusting beast . You 've persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , if not her tone , carried the thought that he , by sheer force of a masterful personality , had won a battle . That it had been almost too easily won he did not allow to destroy his pleasure . The truth was that Lucinda had contended the only proper place to dine would be the fashionable grill . Susan Yates was going to dine there  --  with the head of some silk firm she patronized in New York . In any case , it was the thing to do . Ethan had somewhat heatedly disputed the idea . " Ridiculous , " he disapproved . " Utterly ridiculous , paying for your meals along with your passage in one dining saloon and then paying for them all over again in another . Sheer idiocy . " Lucinda had remarked with unsweetened candor that he evinced remarkable inconsistencies in the matter of economy . What about his bar chits on the way over ? And what about the fact that she had seen him that very afternoon entertaining a siren in the Island of England 's veranda cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for a certain amount of tact . Scarcely pacified by a grunt of even the most dignified caliber , Lucinda had hotly demanded a more articulate explanation . Adopting an expression of great innocence , Ethan had said : " Outside your special fields of d-dogs and d-decorations you r-rarely have competent data , my dear . Mrs Richmond  --  to whom , I take it , you refer  --  does not drink . She told me so . " " Then what was she doing in a bar with you ? " With an even more virtuous look , Mr Van Weck had enlarged his theme : " She was accompanying me . I do not care to d-drink alone . Most normal . Quite . " " For you , " Lucinda had spitefully snapped . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 43Ethan had regarded the ceiling and said magnanimously : " I shall let that somewhat c-cryptic remark pass unanswered . " " Do . I advise it , and I advise we abandon the entire conversation , " Lucinda had then recommended , adding that Ethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , unaccountably , Ethan found he had won the argument . Without further verbal volleys they descended to the main dining saloon . At the door Lucinda paused to compose her entrance and , laying a hand on her husband 's arm , caused him to teeter slightly . " Tell me again the name of your sorceress . " Ethan began to stammer and , answering her own question , Miss Mason exclaimed : " I have it ! Richmond ! " With that she continued regally on her way , leaving Ethan considerably in her wake . At the table Lucinda observed rather overbrightly : " How charming ! It 's Mrs Richmond and Mr Carleton . " The brilliant-eyed woman acknowledged the greeting with her unreal smile , but Carleton beamed , looking precisely as if their arrival had saved him from a shell attack . His bow was elaborate , and he seemed to be doing things with his heels , but Ethan decided that could not be true , as Englishmen did n't click their heels . Only continentals . Silly habit , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair tenderly for Lucinda . The meal progressed with relative tranquillity until a fifth member of the party arrived . The late-corner Lucinda immediatelycatalogued as impossible . In addition to indicating at once a capacity for contributing the entire conversation , she was dressed like nothing short of a trollop , in Miss Mason 's entirely frank opinion . She wore far too much rouge and wore it high like a doll . Her lipstick was applied in hideous cupid bows . Althoughnever again likely to observe a thirtieth birthday , and although possessed of a figure favoring hips and bosom , she wore a mass of sixteen-year-old ruffles . Her brown hair was done in innumerable baby ringlets , and her almost black eyebrows44 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITwere plucked to a minimum . She tucked herself coyly between the arms of the chair next Lucinda and cooed : " Oh , it 's terribly exciting to be at this table . Are you Miss Susan Yates , the designer ? " Somewhat unsociably , Lucinda said : " No . " Taking no offense , the newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm Edith Dalton and I apologize for not introducing myself first , but I 'm just crazy to meet Miss Susan Yates . When I used to show magazine pictures of her clothes to my friends in Paris they always said : Ah , tres joli  --  so like the long-legged Americaines : I think an American designer must be very importantwhen she can please French women . They have such short legs . But , of course , I think American women are really the smartest dressed women in the world . Do n't you ? " And Miss Dalton fastened her coy smile on Mrs Richmond . " Ach , you ask me that when I am German ? Does any woman wish to admit she is not smart ? " " Oh dear ! Oh dear ! Do , please , excuse me , " begged Miss Dalton . Without smiling , Mrs Richmond said : " It is nothing . " Lucinda thought : " How we shall love each other ! What a truly delightful table ! " " If , " announced Ethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be fewer wars . " " Here ! Here ! " ejaculated Carleton . Not abashed for long , Miss Dalton began gurgling once more . She passed ecstatically from subject to subject , telling them how many years it had been since she had lived in her native land and how much she appreciated a family table atmosphere after having practically lived in cafes and restaurants in France ever since her papa had died . After a while Lucinda decided that , with her naivete , the woman was actually winning the others over . Of course she was mainly set on making the men feel like reigning monarchs , but she seemed to be dispelling even Mrs Richmond 's initial anMURDERON THE FACE OF IT 45tagonism . Nevertheless , Lucinda counted the minutes until she could decently suggest leaving the table . Then , to her acute annoyance , Ethan invited everyone to go to the smoke room for brandies . Only Mrs Richmond declined . Miss Dalton , again cheerleader for the conversation , and Carleton accepted . Scowling , Lucinda led the way . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality and go to bed . She had discovered he was recuperating from an attack of seasickness and suspected that only the amount of business his firm annually got from Susan Yates , Inc. , had dragged him into public circulation that evening . At the grill door they said good night . Susan decided to take a turn on one of the open decks . She climbed to the boat deck finally . There were few stars and no moon , but the air felt sharply pleasant against her cheeks . She tucked herself in between two lifeboats and breathed deeply . Then she sighed . Perhaps it was faintly adolescentto feel romantic on ships , but they were no place to be alone if you were afraid you were in love . She sighed again and leaning over the rail scrutinized the black water hissing and churning far below . Only the running lights glanced against the sea . All at once she wished she had n't come up . The deck was dark except for a dull glow from the companionways , and the nearest one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers , the lifeboats were shadowy , formless masses . Sounds of life on the ship seemed distant and unreal  --  a woman 's laugh , high and ghostly , from a lower deck , a bell above in the darkness on the bridge and hypnotically that swill and hiss of the water through which the Island of England was pushing at full speed ahead . Susan tried to think of New York , of Lyle Curtis , of her own shop , her forty-odd employees , her muslin models , herself a few days hence on the floor of her designing room , mouth full of pins , scissors cutting into fabric draped over a dummy manne-46 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITquin . She found herself thinking she 'd like to use Mollasciap 's green tweed if she could get Alma Peters ' dead face out of her memory . Something wrenched her thoughts back to the ship . Suddenly she no longer felt alone . She tried to throw off an instinctively terrifying feeling that she was being watched through the darkness . The deck was as quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ridiculously small sound , a breath drawn in , the faintest stir of perhaps a hand on a rail or a foot moved cautiously . It might have been any or none of these things . It might have been only the breeze . Whatever it was , it ceased existing immediately , as if whoever had caused it were conscious of her attentiveness . The silence which followed seemed a treacherous silence . Eel-like , it crawled and squirmed around her . To go on standing there , waiting for something to happen , was as repugnant as being forced to walk through a snakeinfestedcountry blindfolded . Susan thought : " So this is what it means to be afraid someone will hear your heart beating ? " She was convinced that she must outsilence the silence ; that she must conceal herself if possible . Yet , instinctively , she continued to fear that she was already marked and visible . To still the furious tempo of her heart , she told herself that the whole thing was absurd . What possible danger could she be in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transatlantic liner admiring an evening . Admiring ? She was hating it . Involuntarily , she clutched the rail as if its solidness could dispel her apprehensions . Her eyes caught the faintly glancing running lights , nervous against the motion of the distant water . How many feet away was it  --  twenty feet  --  thirty  --  a million miles ? She waited , and exactly nothing happened . After what seemed a lifetime of seconds she managed to peer cautiously around the nearer lifeboat . There were only shadows seemingly formed by the faint glow from the nearer companionway  --  shadows and solid blackness , nothing else . For a moment Susan considered wildly a plan of sprintingMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 47for the stairs . Then she heard It again  --  the most trivial of sounds . A mere unimportant depletion of silence  --  the echo of wind springing up , far away , in a forest ; but it made her even more certain she was not alone . Someone was watching and with no friendliness . It might be ridiculous . It might be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room to shy at the invisible . It might be that instinct should be a dead human faculty  --  but someone was there ; some thoroughlyunfriendly person ! After more moments Susan considered saying : " Good evening , " in a firm and ordinary tone , then abandoned the plan , knowing perfectly well no words coming through her lips would sound firm and ordinary . Also , something stronger than her will held back the effort . Presently she tried to convince herself that it was just a sailor tightening a rope on a lifeboat . But what sailor would move with such stealthiness ? She had almost made up her mind again to run for the nearer companionway when her heart stood still because of a new sound  --  a more definite sound : footsteps , soft , but distinct and retreating . Susan struggled to pierce the darkness with her eyes . What had appeared to be the dim shadow of the lifeboat seemed to be in motion . Then the dim glow of the more distant companionway picked it out , elongated it , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow with a shadowy train , like a second tail on a gigantic raven . Susan wanted to cry out in anger now : " What were you doing here spying on me ? Who are you ? What did you want ? Are you a man or a woman ? And why were you pretending you were n't here at all ? " However , her tongue remained tied , and slowly a degree of composure ebbed back . Perhaps , despite seeming stealth , whoever it was had been unconscious of her presence or entirely disinterested . Perhaps . But she did not believe it . Her heart was still tight and thumping . The convictionpersisted that a completely unfriendly being had been watching her there in the darkness . Was there perhaps a mad48 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITperson on the ship who followed if you went to a lonely spot , who stood gloating in malevolent silence over the idea of harming someone he or she did not even know ? The idea was fantastic . But the alternative ? That it was someone who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why ? What had she done to anyone on this ship ? What did she know about anyone , capable of making an enmity of which she was unconscious ? Trembling , Susan started for the nearer companionway . Below , on the promenade deck , Miss Yates found the lights friendly but every person she passed a possible enemy . She started to walk rapidly to put her blood into circulation and to get the cold of fear out of her feet and hands . A number of people were promenading or lolling in deck chairs in the glass-enclosed sections of the deck . They looked friendly or lost in thought or sleepy . Which of them was n't ? The sounds of music and voices drifted out from one of the lounges  --  normal , ordinary sounds , gay sounds . Susan tried to pull herself together . Then , not more than a few feet removed from the foot of the : aft companionway , she came across the woman who had come up to them on the sports deck that morning . Camilla Richmond was resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were : closed . Was it her imagination , Susan asked herself , that the. : woman seemed to be breathing jerkily , almost as if recently she had been running ? Mrs Richmond was wearing a slinky black velvet dinner gown and over it a long black velvet coat . Over her hair was a mantillaof fine black lace . Susan passed her hurriedly and in silence but wondering wildly if mantillas could make a raven 's tail . Almost immediately she encountered Leslie Carleton , hurrying along with vigorous steps , evidently bent on the benefits of an evening constitutional . He was smoking a cigarette , and his eyes , behind the fine trail of smoke blowing back in his face , MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 49were narrowed to slits . He was wearing full evening dress , the tails of his coat stirring as he walked . With a brief good eveningSusan hurried also past him . A bit behind Carleton , and evidentlydetermined to catch up with him , was Ethan Van Weck in a dinner jacket , with a light overcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's around somewhere 1-looking for you , " and hurried on . In a moment Susan discovered that she was overtaking Lucindawho had just emerged , it appeared , from the lounge immediatelybelow the aft companionway . That morning Susan had found a stairway leading directly from that lounge to the boat deck . But this was ridiculous , suspecting poor Lucinda of being her raven-tailed enemy . Lucinda had thrown over her scarlet dinner dress a long black cape which billowed out a bit behind her as she strode along . It had a hood . " Red , " Susan suddenly thought , " looks black in the dark  --  as black as it does in photography . " When she came abreast of Miss Mason , Lucinda turned with a faintly startled expression . " Heavens , I had a premonition you were going to turn out to be one of the world 's two greatest bores  --  either that Richmond cat  --  the woman who barged in on us this morning at shuffleboard  --  or another female terror named Dalton , who , my dear , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good coy act , I give you Miss Edith Dalton . I shall likely strangle her before we land . I feel it coming on . And , Susan , wait until you see how she dresses ! Proper clothes for a bordello , I should call them . Though the gills in such places may have the most exquisite taste so far as I know . Anyway , the Dalton person coos . Actually ! She 's too dreadful . And would you believe it , even with all that , Ethan prefers Bright Eyes  --  the Richmond woman . I think he 's rather smitten . She concentrated on him at dinner . Dalton was general . Any man in a pinch . " " I take it , " said Susan , falling into step with the broad-50 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITshouldered Miss Mason , " that you really have n't worked up a good liking for either of these ladies . " " But you do n't know the worst , pet . They 're both at our dining-saloon table . If you leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall , without doubt , commit murder . " " Everyone always seems pretty bad first day or so out . We 'll probably end by inviting them to dine with us as soon as we reach New York , " commented Susan , finding a practical conversationsoothing . Lucinda chuckled . Then Susan asked : " Where have you been keeping yourselfsince dinner ? " " You can call it dinner if you like . I called it a trained-tiger act . To reward my suffering , Ethan had the excruciatingly brilliant idea of inviting everybody to the smoke room for brandies . Mrs Richmond had the grace not to come and , as soon as it was decently possible , I escaped . I 've been wandering around since , wondering if I 'd run into you and your dinner date . " Susan explained about her host 's seasickness hang-over and then said she 'd been on the boat deck . " I started up there , " chirped Miss Mason , " but it was so damn dark I got cold feet . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When did you start up ? " " When ? Why  --  just now . A few minutes ago . Why ? " Shivering despite her warm evening coat , Susan persisted : " Which companionway ? " Lucinda 's head snapped around curiously . But , with her usual vagueness about details not intimately concerning her special interests , she said : " Which one ? Do they have names like Pullman cars ? Now I ask you ! How should I know , pet ? " " I was only wondering  --  if you saw anybody rather sneaking around . " " Sneaking around ! Look here , darling , what is this , a mysteryMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 51story you 're making up ? " Then , without waiting for Susan to answer , Lucinda plunged on : " But , speaking of mysteries , I 'm afraid I 've stupidly let you in for something a bit on the unpleasantside . Conversation got to such low ebb at one point in the smoke room that I foolishly began to talk about what they were missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess I mentioned that an assistant district attorney and you were like that . " Miss Mason expressively crossed two fingers . " Which , " snapped Susan , " you made rather a point of during shuffleboard this morning . " Lucinda looked momentarily contrite and admitted that in the smoke room Miss Edith Dalton had fairly trembled out of her lace ruffles with excitement over the matter . " She thought it was too , too thrilling . She can hardly wait to meet you , and , worse and more of it , she 's got the cabin next yours . I do n't think she 's the kind who would be above a bit of utterly companionablebarging in and out on one 's privacy . Oh , I am a fool ! " Pausing for breath , Lucinda eyed Susan shrewdly . " And I hope I have n't by any chance got you really in a jam by talkingabout that second wireless ? " As casually as possible , Susan said : " You 're incorrigible , Lucinda . Lyle has n't asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucinda , who had been frowning with close attention , permittedher brow to smooth out . They walked on in silence for a moment , until Miss Mason said : " You 'll think it 's silly of me , but I should be absolutely terrified if I thought there were any sort of  --  well , criminal case on board . Ships are such  --  such exposed places , if you know what I mean . People can get at you so easily . I 've often wondered how they can be certain they have n't sold passage to at least a dozen stark , raving mad people . How can they ? " Susan thought it was a singular coincidence that she had had so similar a thought on the boat deck , but she said lightly : " Goose , they have brigs to shut people up in if they go berserk at sea . " 52 MURDER ON THE FACE ' OF ITAt this moment they reached the aft bend in the promenade deck . For some reason the lights fell obliquely from port to starboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking on the inside , made the turn a step or two ahead of Susan . Behind her hooded and caped figure fell a following shadow like a tail . Her footsteps sounded quiet and quick on the deck . Going on talking with her customary vigor , she appeared unconsciousthat Susan had fallen behind , staring at her with startled , unbelieving eyes . CHAPTER EIGHTLUCINDA LOOKED BACK . " What 's the matter ? You look as if you 'd seen what is loosely called a ghost . " Susan shook herself free of the incredible thought which had possessed her . She hurried and fell into step once more , making some excuse about having loosened a heel . Lucinda began jabberingagain , but Susan felt thoroughly shaken . Why was Lucindaso interested in whether Lyle Curtis had wirelessed her about a case ? Why was she so keen to know what Susan knew about a death aboard the Island of England ? Why , after all , had she left Ethan to go wandering off around the ship looking for Susan tonight ? When they reached the aft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go below to her cabin . Before Lucinda could do more than stop to stare Susan darted through the nearest public entrance and made for the elevators . She 'd be safe in bed . At least she supposed so . Reaching B deck and hurrying feverishly toward her cabin , she became conscious that behind her were quick footsteps . They were catching up . Assailed by the alarming notion that their owner was deliberately trying to overtake her , Susan increasedher own pace . At her cabin door she frantically inserted her key in the lock . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 53The footsteps had turned into her corridor . Peering over her shoulder while she tugged at the door handle , Susan saw a woman of indeterminate age wearing a silly black gown of frilly lace . It possessed a long train , and the wearer carried an enormous black lace handkerchief . She was approaching on sharp high heels which gave her a tottering look . Good heavens , it was the frou-frou , high-bosomed person who had tried to hide in the second officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again a mass of baby ringlets , and her lips were once more rouged into ridiculous cupid bows . More serious apprehensionslulled , it occurred to Susan that this must also be the " female terror " Lucinda had been describing . Coming up to her , gurgling , the rufPly person said : " Dear Miss Yates , we missed you so much at table tonight . You see , I 'm at your table , and I 've simply been dying to meet you . I 'm Edith Dalton . I know all about you . " Without waiting for Susan to reply , Miss Dalton gushed on : " I do think it 's a compliment to you that , being able to buy from simply any of the Parisian couturiers and all , I 've still simply adored the pictures of your clothes in American fashion magazines . And I 'm crazy about American career women . You must lead such thrilling lives ! At dinner tonight Mrs Van Weck  --  I think it is  --  the one with the husband ?  --  told us you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused for no other reason , apparently , than to breathe . Susan managed to smile good humoredly and to say , " You are awfully kind , Miss Dalton , I 'm delighted you 've liked my clothes .

She has a wonderful sense of humor . But no one would think of trusting me with police affairs . " Susan hoped she sounded sufficiently scatterbrained . Miss Dalton was not to be put off so easily . She laughed , and it was as suitable a laugh as the proper lid on a kettle . Then54 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITshe cried : " You forget , I read American newspapers . I read every word about that fashion-club case last year , and I definitelyremember that you were mentioned in it ! " " I was , " replied Susan dryly . " As a suspect . Not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opened her cabin door , said good night and shut it firmly . " What an idiot , " she told her silent cabin . " But women like that often get what they want in this world , " she added to her white-faced reflection in the dressing-table mirror . Meanwhile , Lucinda Mason Van Weck had resumed her walk , a thoughtful expression on her face , her square shoulders set aggressively . " I wonder , " she kept saying to herself . " I wonder . " CHAPTER NINETHE TRANSATLANTIC PASSAGE nearly completed , Susan wondered how she had gotten through the third and fourth and fifth days at sea as smoothly as she had . She had been haunted by the persistent thought of indefinable danger , and yet nothing more momentous had occurred than the gradual warming of relationships at their dining-saloon table . After the boat-deck experience , her feeling of unrest had been sufficient to keep her , whenever on deck , in large groups of people . They had talked of nothing but the war , their own delight in being clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Susan had said to Ethan in the dining saloon : " I 'd like to find a retreat where greed is n't advertised as a virtuous talent . " Ethan had sniffed . " Do n't tell me t-there is such a place ? " he ejaculated irritably . Susan had glanced at him sharply , but his expression was , as usual , one of universal and apparently harmless disagreeMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 55ment . Susan had continued to search the faces of all fellow passengers , seeking signs of enmity . She had tried to penetrate behind the shrewd eyes of Anna , her stewardess , behind even the politeness of the ship 's officers , who had appeared flatteringlyappreciative of her silence about Alma Peters . But the only person on board in whom she had discovered any adequate reason for mistrust had been a little man in a nondescript brown suit who had popped up in her path now and again around the ship . She had privately dubbed him Mr-About-To . He seemed eternally on the point of striking a match , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seating himself in a deck chair , of leaning over a rail , of seeming not to have been looking in a deck-cabin window . Yet , in appearance , he looked innocence itself . He talked to no one , played no deck sports , rarely promenaded the main decks , but remained always in drably indeterminate action . Susan had realized he would scarcely have been noted by anyone not in search of an enemy . Although Anna 's broad-beamed shoes had continued to annoy her , the stewardess had given Susan excellent service and , now that they were about to land , she stood smiling and bobbing in Miss Yates 's doorway , expressing thanks for her tip envelope . Behind her , the steward too , he was sure , was hoping Miss Yates would soon travel with the Island of England again . Susan wondered grimly if before she did he might not be in Davy Jones 's locker , for war news had been circulated on the ship . The radio reported a serious international situation followingthe invasion of Poland . Susan 's other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bags were packed , her dutiable foreign purchases recorded on declaration sheets and she was gowned for debarkation . They were already in the outer bay of New York and should be dropping anchor off quarantine within half an hour . Lyle Curtis would come aboard then with the customs men . Glancing at her appearance in the closet 's long mirror , she found it not only a perfectly thought-out fashion announcement56 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT  --  to illustrate what she would tell the ship 's newsmen  --  but designed to present her own best points to Mr Curtis . To pass the time , Susan began rehearsing what she would say to the reporters . Her hat was French  --  Columbie 's  --  Oh darn . All that was easy . But what a grim and difficult job probablylay ahead of Lyle Curtis . He had wirelessed he would come to her cabin for a second before commencing his official duties in the sealed suite next door . Susan began pacing up and down her cabin , as perfectly groomed and chic as a special fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled little girl . Why had she cornmencedto have that feeling of disquiet in Mollasciap 's salon while listening to all the chatter about getting out of Europe fast ? Why had Alma Peters spoken to her ? Why , later , had her dead face borne such an expression of pleased interest ? Who had been on the dark boat deck ? Had it , unaccountably , been Lucinda in her hooded cape ? Ethan , dragging his overcoat ? Leslie Carleton in tails ? The silly Dalton woman with her black lace train ? Camilla Richmond in trailing black velvet and a black mantilla ? But why any of them ? What possible reason ? It was curious what shipboard companions one could make , how the proximities of shipboard pushed forward the barest acquaintanceship into friendliness in a handful or less of days . Lucinda , three days ago , had obviously held Camilla Richmond in only the most tepid esteem , and now , despite the fact that Ethan had shown Mrs Richmond really marked attention , Lucinda seemed to be fond of her . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to dine on Long Island . With Mrs Richmond it might be a wily , wifely plan to cure Ethan of his infatuation by the boredom method . Wives had tried that before with varying results , and undoubtedly Miss Mason knew her Ethan . But why cultivate the high-bosomed , ruffly Miss Dalton ? Because she had spoken rather tiresomely often of her intention to rent an apartment and have it divinely decorated ? Because Lucinda was incapable of failing to follow aMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 57whiff of good business ? Or because Miss Dalton also was interested in Leslie Carleton ? Lucinda had flirted quite openly with the Englishman and not with her usual , good-humored camaraderieeither , but with a kind of tenseness , as if she were punishing her husband or really infatuated . Yet Ethan had continued to make Carleton his boon drinking companion , a function the latter had served with endless sobriety . Except when drinking , however , Ethan had spent most of his time prowling about the ship with the bright-eyed , beautiful Camilla Richmond , who evidently detested liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms than usual with each other ! Nothingabout the voyage made sense . But , Susan ruminated , without its surprises life might possess no perspectives and be dull as Anatole France feared heaven might be . Breaking into these thoughts came an uproar from outside her cabin . Lucinda 's lusty tones were raised in a veritable shriek : " But I tell you he 's disappeared . . . my little lamb . . . You must have left the door open , steward . . . Pure negligence . " Susan stuck her head out of her door . " Is Oscar lost ? " she asked . " Pure negligence , " repeated Miss Mason , still shouting . She stood in the doorway of her own room , straining her sharp green eyes up and down the passage . Appearing from the portside , the stewardess began clapping her hands . " Here he comes , Mrs Van Weck ! Here he is . Here , doggy ! " Lucinda yelped with pleasure and darted toward the stewardess . Around the corner , wagging his tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking none the worse for wear so far as Susan could see . This was presently borne out by Miss Mason herself , after a thorough inspection of the prizewinninganimal . Susan wondered vaguely what dogs did when they ran away on ships . Probably they followed some delectable smell to the galley . Later she learned from Lucinda that Oscar II 's unaccountable , if brief , disappearance must apparently re-58 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITmain a mystery . No steward , no stewardess , no passenger seemed to have seen him en route . Or at least no one admitted it . He had wandered off and back again , a glossy-coated , long-eared , expensive cocker spaniel , handsomely caparisoned and evidently with a will of his own . Lucinda was still bending over Oscar II , inspecting his state of well-being . What a fuss Lucinda made over trivialities . Susan sighed ironically then thought that perhaps Lucinda was having troubles of which none of them knew . Susan returned to her cabin and measured its length with restless feet . All at once she became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a faint shudder , a series of faster shudders , and the SS Island'of England came to a standstill in New York Bay . CHAPTER TENLYLE CURTIS HAD LEAPED for the gangway from the police launchbefore the Island of England came to a standstill . Almost instantly , it seemed to Susan , he was tapping on her door and they were facing each other , grinning and trying without marked success to look merely hearty and casual . " Susan ! It 's good to see you . I like the hat . " " Lyle ! I 'm honored you chose to see me before the corpse . " She thought he looked tired and , at the back of his eyes , worried . She must n't bother him with her premonitions . Curtis grinned again , but there were fine lines of strain around his eyes , giving his face a gaunt look . " Let me look at you , " he demanded , inspecting her critically . " You 've lost weight . Did n't I recommend two lamb chops and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fattening , silly . Unless you drown them in butter . " " Susan ! Are you all right ? I do n't know what it is aboutMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 59you  --  It 's a damned becoming getup , " and he swept her chicness an approving glance . " But you look  --  like a child left out in the dark . " " Flatterer . You mean I look infantile ? " " If it were n't so unlikely , I 'd say scared . " Susan endeavored to sound aggressive . " Do n't be so impulsivelypolite ! " Continuing his narrow scrutiny , Curtis demanded : " Has anythinghappened ? Has it ? " Seeking refuge behind a very amateurish version of the sort of baby stare Edith Dalton bestowed upon men , Susan repeated : " Happened ? To me ? Of course . I 've got an attack of selfconsciousness . The assistant district attorney of New York calls on me in , I assume , a spirit of solicitous courtesy . Immediately he begins looking me over in a highly accusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conserving my strength for an ordeal ahead . Any moment the ship 's news reporters will be expecting me to describe the Paris openings in succinct and witty sentences " Curtis interrupted , still dubious : " But you do n't look right . " " Perhaps it is the hat . Stop staring at me . Tell me what Alma Peters had done . " Because of his expression at mention of Alma Peters ' name , Susan abruptly abandoned her badinage . " Lyle , is the case very grubby ? " Curtis grimaced . " I pulled a beautiful boner , Susan . A beauty ! " Glancing swiftly at his wrist watch , he added , " But I 'll have to tell you about it later . See you when the Island docks . Did I remember to say I 've invited myself to dinner at your apartment ? You are going to have dinner . I ordered it myself . " " Plain efficiency , Mr Curtis . Did you do the marketing too ? " He was halfway out the door now . " Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistook me for Santa Claus . " Susan assumed an attitude of detached contemplation . " Humm . A long white beard might be becoming . I 'll think it over . " 60 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITMr Curtis bowed with extravagant dignity . " Tell me later , Snow White . " Susan 's eyes followed his well-tailored , muscular shoulders . She was thinking he combined too many qualities an intelligent woman might prescribe , given opportunity to write her own prescription . He was an athlete who chose not to overadvertise the fact . He behaved without conscious formula in drawing rooms and in the much less polite surroundings known to his profession . He was , of course , what was called a " born and bred , " but , beneath his sometimes maddening calm , she knew he could be a very expedient policeman . He disliked the criminal point of view , and that made him both a natural man hunter and an adventurer . His rise in the district attorney 's office had been rapid , and his intelligence was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scofield himself had told Susan with emphasis . But heretofore , when she had known Curtis ' mind to be working fastest on a case , his eyes had not held their present look of disquiet . The Alma Peters case , she thought with a pang , must be worse than his light words of having " pulled a boner " were intended to convey . So they both were unsuccessfully trying to reassure the other ! Usually Curtis ' personality was capable of making her feel at once a tower of strength and all female  --  a combination no woman not desirous of selling herself short on self-knowledge could deny approving  --  but now she felt confused and spineless . Turning to inspect herself again in the closet mirror , she decided that at least she looked her grandmother 's definition of a lady : as if her underclothing would be as good as her outer . But she saw what Lyle Curtis had undoubtedly seen in her eyes  --  not terror , not exactly panic , but nagging apprehension . Returning her thoughts resolutely to Curtis , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was well-equipped . But his hair had a ridiculous way of behaving , and his chin was much too much of a chin . His eyes were no particular shade of gray . He had inherited a soft quality of voice from the SouthernMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 61side of his family , but it could become forcefully efficient and terse . It could bite into words , yet it could say : " I like the hat ! " And " Susan , you look like a child left out in the dark . " Aloud , she exclaimed : " Susan Yates , I think you 've pursued this inventory far enough ! " With that she walked energetically out into the alleyway , peering inquisitively at the closed entrance to the late Alma Peters ' suite and stopping to listen with unabashedinterest to the sounds of officialdom at work . There were scraping noises as if trunks were being pulled about . Heavy feet . Someone was pounding on a metal surface . All very mysterious . She had a fiendish desire to open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman all but catapulted over her . He gave her a quick suspicious stare , then a look of recognitionand , saluting , hurried off . In his embarrassment he had left the door open . She could see two men in their shirt sleeves dusting black powder out of jars with ordinary-looking paintbrushes . As she watched , one of the men put his brush down and picked up the piece of note paper he had been dusting . He looked at it closely , grunted and began swishing the powder back and forth , moving the paper like a cradle . Then , dumping the powder onto a newspaper , he grunted again , put the note paper down on a table and proceeded to level a battery fingerprintcamera over it . That , Susan remembered , was what Curtis had called them . There was another plain-clothes man visible with what Lyle had spoken of as a " half-mile " electric lantern . He was whisking the beam back and forth over the white-and-pink finish of a door . Still another man was busy dusting white powder on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested , then disappointed , in something naturally entirely invisible to Susan . Near him , Curtis seemed to be superintending the inspection of a trunk , ordinary looking except for commanding costliness . Susan toyed with the idea of walking in . Perhaps they would n't notice her ; but , at that moment , consideration of her chance of getting away with it was interrupted by a commotion at the end62 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITof the main alleyway . In another second she was surrounded by a dozen or more men of varying ages and varying sartorial tastes . Simultaneously , a plain-clothes man banged shut the suite door . Telling herself not to look childish , Susan faced the gentlemen of the press . The representative of the Globe sounded ironic but hopeful . He wanted to know if , despite the war , ladies were going to be pretty . Or were the Paris fashions crazy ? Being reassuring , informative and as bright as possible , Susan kept on wondering if they did not know a suicide investigation was under way within ten feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Yates ? " the Globe man persisted . " Small waists . Daintiness . Proof of women 's desires to brighten up life in a time of world crisis . " What on earth was she saying ? Did it make sense ? Why had Lyle looked so deeply concerned ? She forced herself to listen to the man from the Times-Despatch . He wanted a technical description of a bustle . Susan felt suddenly a little hysterical . It was too bad Lucinda was n't there . She could exhibit Ethan  --  the living bustle . But dutifully she gave a definitionand explained the importance of the bustle in the mode . A news association man was asking about colors . Susan spoke her piece automatically . There was a new shade  --  orchid red . Very smart . Quantities of it in a number of the collections . Magnificentlybecoming to blondes . And white ! White was extremely important . Unusual in the fall . Scribbling ceased and other questions followed . More scribbling . More questions . Finally the ship 's newsmen thanked Miss Yates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed door behind her and vanished . But it was anticipation , not thwarted curiosity , she had read in their eyes . The story of Alma Peters ' suicide must already have broken in the American press . They were merely waiting for more details , she felt certain . Susan returned energetically to her eavesdropping . But soundsMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 63from within the suite were even less entertaining . Repressing the inclination to tap on the door and see what would happen , she turned back to her own cabin . At that moment she saw once more the funny little man in the nondescript brown suit . He was standing at the portside end of the alleyway and appeared to be seriously troubled by the problem of deciding whether or not to light a cigarette . Susan cast him a quick dubious glance and ducked into her own quarters , thinking she must tell Lyle Curtis at the first opportunity about this loiterer . CHAPTER ELEVENTHROUGH THE BULKHEAD separating Susan 's cabin from the late Alma Peters ' there was nothing to hear . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch the official routine , she made several more expeditionary trips into the corridor . On the first and second scouting junkets , the little brown man had disappeared . On the third , he had reappeared . When she faced him , hesitant and vague as to eye , halfway down the passage , he melted from view in direction of the main corridor . Susan felt certain he had been listening at the suite door . The possibility might make an excuse for her to knock at it and ask to speak to Mr Curtis . While she was considering this possibly fortuitous circumstance , Sergeants McQuire and Withers , known to her from the Murder in Style ' case , appeared . They were bearing  --  there was no other word for it  --  between them another dowdy , but older , man , an unenterprising-looking figure wearing thick-lensed glasses and an expression of having just been allowed to peek under a drawn window shade . Whateverhad been revealed to him seemed to have confirmed his worst suspicions . He looked far more horrified than elated by'Crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicitous care being accorded him . The sergeants hurried their charge on into the suite , closing its door with rather unnecessary firmness , she thought . It was like an impeccably polite slap in the face , and she was besieged by conflicting emotions combined confusedly of curiosity and indefinite apprehensions . After a rather large number of moments Sergeant McQuire opened the door again and conducted his corpulence into the alleyway , a frown of tranquil confusion corrugating his brow . For a fleeting second Miss Yates could see Lyle Curtis standing in the suite 's drawing room , apparently scrutinizing a piece of paper which looked like a cablegram . " Ah , " she thought , noddingsagely to herself , " the warning cable Alma Peters received in Paris ! " Then the door banged shut behind Sergeant McQuire , and he lumbered off with surprising speed , considering his overallbulk . Susan began to feel frustrated and a little foolish , hanging around this way . The kittenish Miss Edith Dalton , she supposed , would have managed to inject herself into official activities long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Forehead puckered , she pondered whether men did not , after all , rather get a kick out of arch and silly women of the clingingvineschool . Presently , coming to the root of this mental digression , Susan told herself severely : " But Lyle is n't emotionally immature . At least I do n't think he is . He does n't seem to be . Edith Dalton wo n't appeal to him at all . Of course with Lucinda 's silly plans for us all getting together ashore , they 'll meet and Edith will undoubtedly turn on her **28;6295;TOOLONG . But  --  well , what of it ? " Suddenly Miss Yates paused in her corridor pacing . Was n't it definitely on the odd side that , ever since the ship had dropped anchor , there had not been a single passenger beside herself and the little brown man in her alleyway ? She did n't think the startled-looking little man , led by Sergeants McQuire and Withers , had been a passenger . Not a first-class passenger anyMURDERON THE FACE OF IT 65way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else ? An obvious explanation burst on her with somewhat ridiculousclarity . Everyone was up where she should be in the main lounge showing passports and custom declarations to the governmentmen . She , Susan Yates , was an idiot . Dashing into her cabin , she grabbed her handbag and hurried away . No sooner had Susan entered the lounge than something else dawned on her . There was in the place an air of a railroad station . Because she was so tardy , Susan was surprised to find passengers still there . A number of them were sitting about on ornate chairs looking irritated . There was something else about them . They reproduced some picture in her mind . With another quick glance she had it ! Lucinda Mason added for good measure , the others were the same people who , like monkeys in a hurricane , had crowded her alleyway the afternoon of the storm  --  all passengers from B deck forward . The passport officials obviously were co-operating with Curtis in keeping that part of the ship free of the curious for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated somewhere else . The Van Wecks were beckoning to her . Susan went over to them , having to step around Oscar II , secure on his handsome leash and looking distinctly bored . Lucinda appeared amused and specifically because Ethan was not . Ethan 's face was red . " O-official red tape ! " he spluttered . " Some damn fool jackanapesover there , " and he gestured with fine scorn toward a green baize-covered table , " s-says our passports were n't stamped properly at Le Havre . Ridiculous . Entirely ridiculous . " " What did I tell you ? " observed Lucinda to Susan . " Wherever Ethan goes outrages occur . He 's a kind of Typhoid Mary , or whatever her name was . Carries outrages and drops them about . " 66 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " That , my dear , " announced Ethan with some solemnity , " is scarcely what I should call a f-flowering of w-wit . " With competence , Lucinda ignored her spouse and explained to Susan that they had merely been caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuss-budget . Overwhelmed by his own importance . I do n't know whether he 's wirelessing France or what . Just wants us to wait . But as I 've pointed out to Ethan , what of it ? There 's nothing else to do in any case . We ca n't jump overboard and swim up the harbor . Not even Ethan recommends that . " " I , " spluttered Ethan , " said nothing w-whatsoever about such a thing . " " Tut tut , pet , " Lucinda counseled , " do n't lose your temper . By the way , Susan , have you seen Lyle Curtis ? " She sounded enormously casual . " I thought he might have come aboard with the passport men to surprise a certain internationally known dress designer . It seemed to me an extraordinary number of people did come aboard at quarantine . Such a pack of press men . Well , I was just wondering if Lyle had Lucinda was n't much good at being disarming . She was only difficult when she did not know she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like to know , darling , but the question is would you broadcast the news if a beau had come way out here practically into the Atlantic Ocean to meet you ? " Lucinda looked at Susan as if she were some lower form of hoarder but hunched a shoulder philosophically . " Since you 're in such an informative mood , perhaps you can tell me why Alma Peters does n't have to show up here like the rest of us to have her passport and declarations looked over ? Ethan and I were the first people down and it looks as if we 'll be the last to leave . She has n't shown up yet . " Susan was moving away , pretending not to hear , but she would have paid to have seen Ethan 's expression . At the green baize table taking care of the " Y 's , " Miss Yates 's tardiness was not mentioned . She was treated with a maximumMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 67of courtesy and decided Lyle Curtis was probably as responsible for this as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , she had to pass Edith Dalton , obviously also being " delayed " as another B deck passenger but not in mourning over the circumstance . She wore a flaming red coat suggestive of a Graustarkian castle-guard 's uniform and hailed Susan with arch jubilance . " Is n't it exciting ? Landing , I mean , and everything ? Even being held up here over our silly old passports is rather thrilling . I thought I was going to have my head chopped off for a moment . " " Even for a moment , " remarked Susan , " would be painful . " Miss Dalton was immersed in another thought . " And the skyline , " she caroled . " New York has changed completely since I saw it last . Of course I was practically a child . " Glancing through a lounge window , Susan did not feel it worth while to comment on the fact that the haze outside must be something of a deterrent to a really valuable inspection of the towers of Manhattan . Instead , she tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm hand on her arm . " You look simply divine today . I adore your clothes . Simply love them . Expect me at your salon the first minute I have . " Finally Susan escaped . She found Alma Peters ' door open and Curtis standing on the threshold looking exasperated . Irritation seemed entirely to have replaced the uneasiness she had sensed in him before . " Not a damn thing we hoped for , " he expostulated . " And it wo n't improve the D.A . ' s temperature . It was up to one hundred and six in the shade this morning . This Peters woman knocking herself off leaves us with exactly nobody but underlings . She was the works from start to finish . I 'm confident of that . But she seems to have taken with her into the Great Beyond all the evidencewe wanted . " " How maddening , " sympathized Susan . Curtis dug his hands into his trousers ' pockets . " Queer thing , 68 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITa woman like Alma Peters choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shrewd defense lawyer " His voice bit the words to a sharp period . " What on earth , " begged Susan , " was she doing ? Was she eating the members of her board of directors ? " " Nibbling at their pocketbooks , " Curtis replied . Then he smiled ruefully down at her . " I 'd like to forget the whole damn case . It 's a dumb trick unloading my troubles on you before you 've got your feet on dry land even . " " But I do n't understand why it should all fall on your shoulders , Lyle . I thought the district attorney 's office was supposed to prosecute cases in court , not be held responsible for suicides and such . " Impatiently , Curtis lit a cigarette , flipping the match away with exasperation . " We 're supposed to bring crooks in when we start after them , and I was after Alma Peters . Moreover , the D.A . ' s having the pressure put on him . Plenty of it . Outraged public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more work to do in this man 's town , and we do n't want another faction worming its way back into power . My thinking it would be so clever not to extradite Alma Peters was a piece of colossal brilliance . In other words , a rotten break for the D.A . ' s office . " Susan tried a light touch . " In Hollywood colossal is several degrees under supercolossal and supercolossal is way beneath terrific . " Curtis rammed his hands deeper in his pockets and began looking bleak again . " Then I used the wrong word . Terrific is right . " At that , someone inside the suite called to him , and , grinning dolefully at Susan , he turned , saying : " Tell you more over dinner . " " I believe you said we were having reindeer ? " " And baked caviar with fried tiger whiskers . See you on the pier and drive you uptown . You 'll have freedom of the port . I fixed it up for the Van Wecks , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FACE OF IT ' 69Going on to her cabin with his final words lingering in her ears , Susan unexpectedly and a little nervously asked herself what , after all , she really knew about Lucinda and Ethan . She 'd known Lucinda in business for some years ; considered her a good business woman  --  none better ; a self-made lady . Ethan was surely an open book  --  the not resplendently bright but far from dull last of the Van Wecks . " Oh well , " she consoled herself inside her cabin , " I do n't suppose Lucinda 's smuggling in more than two or three abbey doors and an Aubuson rug or two , and the worst Ethan can be up to is surely a bit of scotch and tobacco . " The North Humbard Line pier presented the usual sight of agitated activity when debarkation of passengers from the SS Island of England got under way . People bumped down the gangplank and stood about in compact communities of luggage and confusion . Customs officers moved around with sheaves of papers and the maddening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booths lengthened . Lucinda 's cocker spaniel barked excitedly and tugged on his leash . " I 'm simply delighted , " Oscar II 's mistress shouted to Susan , " that he does n't have to be mauled about by odious quarantine veterinarians . " She regarded her prize winner approvingly . " You 're an American dog , are n't you , my little lamb ? And you do n't have to be treated like a disease-infected foreigner . " By way of answer , Oscar II exchanged violent barks with a Boston bull terrier passing within canine conversational distance on another leash . " I ca n't understand , " Lucinda shouted , on eying the bull terrier , " what makes people so idiotic as to put chain leashes on small dogs . Far too heavy for their necks . How would you , Ethan , like a chain around your neck ? " Ethan muttered something sounding remarkably much like : " I have , " but Lucinda let it pass and went on into a necessarily shrieked , one-woman discussion of the advantages of round70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat leather , to none of which either Susan or Ethan paid great attention . Susan was peering around , looking for Ruby Holt , her redheadedGalatea  --  ex-telephone operator and now her trusted assistant at the shop . She had wirelessed the girl to meet her at the pier . Presently a flaming head became visible over the sea of faces . When Ruby reached them Susan greeted her warmly before sending her off with the customs declarations of her salon purchasesand armed with a well-stuffed wallet . After presumably a somewhat protracted inward struggle in which his conscience had won , Ethan declared that , while it was very nice of Curtis to have arranged freedom of the port for them , he felt honor bound to pay for some liquor reposing in his luggage . He marched off looking virtuous . At this moment Ruby Holt came back and Lucinda turned Oscar II 's leash over to her and went to speak to a friend . Curtis came up just before Ethan returned , and immediately they formed a small parade headed by four porters with luggage trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason pointed out the flamboyant figure of Miss Edith Dalton just disappearingtoward the elevators . " Such murderous taste , " hissed Lucinda ; " but , Susan , mark my words that brainless charmer has money . Wait until you see the apartment I 'm going to decorate for her . " They were in a crowded elevator by now but as usual the decorator ignored the presence of strangers . She was still talking about Miss Dalton 's taste and worldly goods when they reached the pavement outside the pier . There the confusion and racket of West Street succeeded in drowning her broadcast confidences . So unexpectedly that Susan wondered if she could n't have heard something of what Lucinda had been saying , Miss Dalton stood beside them , caroling in her kittenish fashion : " I just want to say good-by again and to thank you all for such a marvelous voyage . " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 7IA little grudgingly , Susan found herself presenting Lyle . Miss Dalton was instantly several degrees more ecstatic . It was tootoothrilling to meet a district attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as crime . If not impressed , Curtis appeared to be at least not depressed . He shook the hand which the scarlet-coated young woman curled into his and grinned at her . This was interrupted rather too soon for Miss Dalton 's probable pleasure by the arrival of the brilliant-eyed Mrs Camilla Richmond , who said in her pleasantlyguttural voice that she had come to say auf Wiedersehen . She included them all in this , then turned pointedly to Ethan Van Weck . " I thank you for so much , Mr Gentleman Farmer . You have been so very kind . We shall meet again then , soon ? " Lucinda interrupted with great heartiness . " Oh , my goodness , yes . I 'm ringing you almost immediately for dinner with us on Long Island . You love farms , I know . " She looked as if she had thought better of adding : " And farmers . " But then Ethan , of course , was n't exactly a farmer , nor was his ancestral estate at Glen Cove precisely a farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together very , very soon for the promised dinner , Susan discoveredLeslie Carleton shouting and waving from the running board of a taxi . She called the others ' attention to him but , at this moment , there was a commotion from behind Lucinda where Ruby and Oscar II had been standing . Everyone whirled around . Flat on her face , attempting somewhat unsuccessfully to rise , was the redhead , Susan 's Galatea . Ruby Holt 's hat and bright hair were askew . One glance and Susan guessed she was more angry than hurt , but how on earth had the child managed to land in such an unseemly position ? " Whatever happened to you ? " Lucinda demanded as Curtis and Ethan got Ruby to her feet . " The dog ! " cried Ruby , massaging her right wrist . " A guy grabbed your dog ! " 72 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITCHAPTER TWELVELUCINDA MASON possessed an excellent pair of lungs . She was using them to advantage , shouting " Oscar ! Oscar ! Oscar ! " to the entirety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You stupid idiot ! Why did you drop the leash ? " When she actually began shaking the girl Susan intervened . " Now , now , Lucinda . Ruby 's hurt her wrist . The dog just got away . I 'm sure Ruby did her best to hang on . " " I certainly did , " Ruby defiantly insisted . " That guy pushed me flat and just pulled the leash right out of my hand . " Lucinda continued to look darkly suspicious but ceased laying hands on the girl . Peering over the mass of heads around them , Curtis asked : " Are you sure , Ruby , there was a man and he pushed you ? " " Sure there was , and he did it on purpose . " " What did he look like ? " persisted Curtis . " He was a chauffeur , " Ruby explained , still indignant . " And I 'd know him again if I saw him . A regular roughneck . " Curtis signaled Sergeant McQuire , who was standing near by , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and piles of luggage . While Susan inspected Ruby 's injured wrist , Ethan , on Lucinda 's shouted injunction , began to make an aimless inspection of the near-by terrain , a task difficult at best considering the human feet , wheels and baggage covering it . Meanwhile , Mrs Richmond stood by , her expression mystified . Miss Dalton looked genuinely thrilled . Lucinda was still shouting . To say that people were looking at them oddly was putting it with the greatest diplomacy . Another one of Curtis ' men came up and Susan said to him : " Sergeant Withers , someone tripped Miss Holt , and Mrs Van Week 's cocker spaniel got away . Mr Curtis and Sergeant McQuireare looking for the dog . " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 73Sergeant Withers immediately undertook an inspection of the forest of feet . " I 'm sure , Miss Yates , " Ruby Holt insisted , " that guy meant to push me . " " But , " reasoned Susan , " are you certain , Ruby , that he deliberatelypulled the dog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been pushing his way through the crowd  --  bumped into you in his hurry and perhaps tripped over the leash , accidentallyjerking it from your hand ? " Ruby looked doubtful , but Susan laid hold of Lucinda and made her listen to a repetition of this theory . Miss Mason proved disinterested . She went on howling Oscar 's name . Susan further predicted that Curtis and Sergeant McQuire would be back with the dog in a second or so but this was not borne out . They returned presently empty-handed . No one seemed to have seen Oscar II . One porter had thought he 'd seen a man  --  maybe a chauffeur  --  maybe getting into a big car  --  with maybe a cocker spaniel , but it had developed he had no very clear idea what a cocker looked like . A taxi driver had heard a dog barking from a private car . But there must , as Curtis pointed out , be half-ahundreddogs in the debarkation traffic . Lucinda was beside herself . She continued alternately to accuse Ruby of deliberate misconduct and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's indignation was not exactly abating . Finally Susan suggested that they send her assistant off to a doctor , and Curtis offered an official car and dispatched her . Then the Van Weck town car and chauffeur put in an appearance . Ethan and Lucinda  --  the latter with difficulty  --  were persuadedthat the thing for them to do was to go home . Curtis promised to leave a couple of men at the pier to go over West Street with a fine-tooth comb once traffic had thinned out . " If , " he said , " the dog 's been stolen , we 'll get the police on it . " " But , " wailed Lucinda , nevertheless getting into her car , " he was going to be the best dog in America . " Susan was half amused because Curtis was sounding fatherly. 74 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " Now , now , Lucinda , we 've ways of tracing lost dogs as well as lost people in New York City . " Her square shoulders sagging , Miss Mason sank back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's an outrage and it is an out-rage . " " And that , " sighed Susan , as they finally drove off , " is the first time there 's been a thorough agreement in the Van Weck family for six weeks ! " In his own official car , Curtis asked Susan : " Who was the amateur Mae West ? " Susan stared . " Who ? " " The gal who thinks crime is too something-or-other . Thrilling , I believe , was her word . " " Oh , Miss Dalton . She 's been living abroad for years . Lucinda could n't bear her at first , but later she smelled some business and got the notion of shore reunions and such . The gal is rich , I understand . Or so Lucinda understands . She 's going to do her an apartment full of ruffles . You know Lucinda . Her success lies in being able to interpret the owners of houses and apartments with more taste than they could do . But she never makes the mistake  --  these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very smart . " " The Van Wecks fought on the trip ? " " They were a bit in each other 's hair . And Ethan fell for the bright-eyed woman  --  Camilla Richmond  --  who came up just before Ruby fell on her face . But Lucinda also had a flirtation . She came all of a dither over the man who shouted at us from a taxi  --  Leslie Carleton . " " English ? " " I believe so . Very Pall Mallish . Ethan used him as a royally appointed drinking chum . Lucinda and Ethan ignored each other 's infatuations very successfully . Even got more mutually amiable the last couple of days . " " The Richmond person has certainly got eyes . " " So Ethan apparently thought . " Susan realized suddenly thatMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 75she had n't considered Camilla Richmond would present any possible competition , although she had not been surprised to have Lyle question her about the coy Edith Dalton .

Yes , Camilla Richmond was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite Ethan 's attachment , that men were Mrs Richmond 's sin  --  if she had one and was not , like many seemingly seductive women , just sinful looking . " And who , " requested Curtis with a grin , " was the skinny girl you spoke to just as we pulled away from the curb at the pier ? " Susan laughed . " You 're very inquisitive , Mr Curtis . I really should have written up some biographical sketches for you . The skinny girl is a manicurist on the ship . Oh , you might have something there : she got her job through Alma Peters . Came down with sinus trouble while working in the Alma Products salon . Miss Peters recommended her to the Island of England beautyshop concession . The manicurist told me so . " " Why ?

Oh , she had dumps in Nassau and various places , but she could n't have kept in them all a twentieth of the stuff presumablystored . She pretended to buy supplies all over the world through an equally mythical buying office in London . It consisted of one man and a desk . Vast and entirely fictitious orders were constantly being placed with London to be delivered to this or that West Indies warehouse . Checks , in due course , went from New York to London to pay for these orders . The dear76 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITstockholders held the bag . Thousands of dollars were checked out to the London buying office ' each month . Had been for three years . As a result , it appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of competition , prices could n't be greatly increased . Profits and dividends were growing slimmer . When last audited , Alma Products ' books were leaning definitely toward the red . Previously , bills of lading and invoices from London appeared to be in perfect order . The C.P.A. found nothing smelly ; that is , until the last audit , after which he came to us . We set to work . We spotted the guy in London  --  the address of his apparently busy office ' and his general appearance  --  and , overnight , he folded up mysteriously . That was about three weeks ago , just as ScotlandYard was going to nab him for us . And there 's not a trace of where or under what name or names the loot was finally deposited . All the New York checks were cashed  --  not deposited  --  in a prominent bank where , under the name of Archibald Smith , the London bird had an account adequate enough to cover each single transaction . His bank assumed the cash was taken out for pay rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depositing the money  --  if he did deposit it in England  --  because even money 's traceable over there . " Susan nodded and asked : " How much do you suppose she got away with ? " " Oh , millions altogether . Over a period of about three years . " " What put the auditor on to it finally ? " Susan 's eyes were bright now with excitement . She had forgotten her own premonitions . Here was real-life crime on a grand scale , not silly imaginings . " He was a smart auditor , " explained Curtis , " but it was not his C.P.A. knowledge that turned the trick . He reads encyclopediasor something . He thought it was funny the Nassau warehousehad managed to absorb in twelve months three times the world 's known supply of ambergris  --  that whale and tropical seas substance they use in perfume . According to purchasesMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 77listed , Alma Products was destined to use a hell of a lot of it  --  more than all the perfumers in the world could manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this auditor was a nut on world supplies ! And that 's where our luck stopped . Nothing but blind alleys after that and then the Peters woman 's suicide . " " How long have you been working on it , Lyle ? " " Alma Peters had gone to Europe  --  to Cannes and then to London  --  when the auditor trotted around to us with his suspicions . It was about the time you sailed for France . We first planned to have the Yard pick up both Miss Peters and her London agent ' there , to bring her , at least , back under extradition . Then the agent , as I said , disappeared , but Alma Peters went right on about her business , showing no apparent concern over a suddenly defunct buying office that had handled millions of dollars ' worth of business for her firm presumably . She concentrated on ordering new bottle and box designs from an Englishartist . It almost looks , now , as if our suspicions had nothing to do with her London actions  --  as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether . She did n't go near its address , appeared in public very little , lived elegantly but quietly at her hotel , transacting her business with the artist largely over the telephone . Bottles and jars and boxes arrived there for her inspection . Her hotel chambermaid saw them in her suite . She had no visitors , yet she managed to make nothing she did seem furtive . She was just a lady of very quiet tastes who sought no limelight . I suddenly got the notion  --  God , what a notion !  --  of stopping the extradition plan , of letting her think nothing was up until she got back to New York . I reasoned that that way she might let friend agent ' reappear in the picture , that she might make some false step useful to us , because we badly needed more evidence . At that point she could have come into court with a fine tale of being the duped one instead of the brains behind everything . She still would have had a good chance at that if she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  that , and the fact that we ca n't figure out how in78 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IThell she got wind of anything here , of the investigation we were making . There does n't seem to be a chance of a leak having occurred here in our office . And yet "  --  Curtis frowned  --  " she got an unsigned cable in Paris a few hours before she went down to Le Havre to sail . It indicated that she 'd do better to lie low in Europe for a while  --  or so we 've got to interpret it . " Susan nodded . " Yes , she mentioned it in her suicide note , did n't she ? " " Oh yes . Her informant seemed highly informed . And look here , nobody outside a few trusted persons knew we were even going to indict her . " " How about the auditor ? " Susan asked , wrinkling her brow . Curtis looked at her narrowly , then shook his head . " Does n't hold water , my little sleuth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what our next move would be . He is n't anybody 's half-wit . But what would be the point ? He 's been impartially seeking justice and was solely responsible for putting the fabulous Alma by way of being in a very nice fix . Why turn around and tip her off ? " Susan wrinkled her nose . " Excuse it , please , Mr Assistant DistrictAttorney . But , dropping your altruistic auditor and going back to Alma the Great , why did she have her London agent ' do a disappearance act at such an appropriate time ? And on the other hand , one could have another theory " " Susan and her theories ! Now do n't you get excited about this case . Next thing I know you 'll be investigating it . " Susan said : " Well , I 'm grateful for one chuckle out of you at least . You look terribly tired . " " I 'll tell you a big secret : Every time I look at you I get rested . " For a moment they dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district attorney 's office . Susan , however , could see that Curtis was more deeply disturbed by the Peters case than she had seen him regarding one not involving murder . She would have taken a bet on it that he was notMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 79immune to premonitions too , and reasoned that , with it so tightly wedged just below the surface of all his thoughts , it might do him good to talk about it . Wrinkling her nose at him again , she said : " Well , since you are so anxious to hear it , my second theory was if , on the other hand , Alma did have her London agent ' disappear because of what your office was up to , why , then , did she calmly go about her business and plan to sail back to New York until she got the warning cablegram in Paris ? It does n't fit . " Curtis hunched his wide shoulders , a grim look again in his eyes . " Nothing fits . Perhaps it never will now she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out who sent the cablegram in order to shake that bird down . " " No suspicions ? " " It was neatly handled . First thing we learned was that a kid about fourteen had walked into a cable office in New York and filed the message . He paid cash and pocketed the change . The cable office assumed he was a private messenger from somebody'soffice . The message was unsigned . Again they assumed an innocent reason : saving expense of extra words . It was a chatty and sympathetic cable , sounding like advice from a husband . It said : Weather very poor here advise six years in Europe . ' " " Six years ? " " Yes , that was rather stretching the kindly husband theory but cable-office clerks are n't paid to psychoanalyze messages . " " But why six years ? " " Life of an indictment , according to the statute of limitations . " " Is it ? And you could n't find the fourteen-year-old boy who filed the cable , I suppose ? " " Curious part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for orders at the cable office happened to know the kid . Mere chance . We traced him down and brought him in . His8o MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITstory was short and dead-end . A uniformed chauffeur had hailed him from a drugstore down the street half a block from the cable office saying : " Here , sonny , want to make some easy cash ? Save me a walk on these sore dogs and duck down to the cable office in this block . Give ' em this envelope and pay what they tell you . Here 's five bucks . You keep the change . ' The kid did as he was told . The charges were $3.09 . He pocketed the change . Only thing that made him uneasy was that he 's pretty sure the chauffeur followed him to see he did what he 'd been told . He thought that funny because the man had said his feet hurt . However , when the boy came out of the cable office the chauffeur had disappeared . He was glad enough to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing until we brought him in . We 've checked the kid back to his cradle . No reason to suspect he knew any more than he told us . " As Curtis finished the car drove up with a flourish before Miss Yates 's apartment . They went up in the elevator and were greeted at Susan 's floor by an enthusiastic black Lillian . Presently they had settled themselves before a pleasantly glowing fire with a cocktail tray between them . The room was full of flowers for which Mr Curtis was being duly thanked . " But they 're lovely , Lyle . I 've never seen so many . I shall go to Europe more often , war or no war . " " You will not . " Mr Curtis looked very firm . " Would it be asking too much of you to hope that you will lead a nice quiet life for a while ? " Susan thought : " Now 's the time to tell him about whoever stalked me on the boat deck and about all my darn premonitions , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's had his mind thoroughly off the Alma Peters case . " So she said : " Well , the only time a girl gets tons of flowers is when she comes back from somewhere , goes somewhere or just plain dies . " " Maybe I should n't bring it up , but I have been missing you . " " I went around Europe drinking silent toasts to you myself . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 81Twice in London  --  once at Claridges and again at a new club called the Cuckoo . Then in Paris I kept thinking bearded policemenwere going to turn out to be you , and on the ship there was  --  oh , I meant to tell you about him earlier  --  a funny little man in a brown suit who definitely did not resemble you , but every time I saw him I thought of you . Unfathomable  --  the workings of the human brain . I called him  --  that man  --  Mr-About-To . " Leaving out her own spidery fingers sensations , Susan describedthe little man 's indefinite behavior and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alma Peters ' corridor door while Curtis and his men were at work . Lyle 's face was etched with lines of amusement . " Want to know who your little brown man was ? " " It would be indecent to say no : Who was he ? " " Federal Bureau of Investigation chap . They had a tip  --  quite a bit of cocaine was supposed to be shipped over on the Island of England . Brownie was planted on board accordingly . Crack investigator . Excellent man . Gives everyone the impression he 's slightly cracked  --  everybody , that is , except the F.B.I . officials . " " Did he find anything ? " demanded Susan interestedly . " Have n't heard . Asked Bob Thornton of the Bureau to give me a buzz here tonight . You 're not going to throw me out right away , are you ? " " Every time a man assumes charge of all my culinary arrangements , ordering reindeer and flowers , I always ask him to stay at least all evening . " " He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , once they had settled down again before the fire , she sensed the look of disquiet at the back of Curtis ' eyes , and again she postponedtelling him of her own uneasiness . Curtis lit a cigarette for her and passed it across the coffee table , remarking : " The Alma Products stockholders are putting up a first-class howl . They want their missing corporate capital. 82 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITThey want their back dividends . They want to know where Alma socked away the boodle in Europe . They see no good reason why we ca n't read corpses ' minds . They bitterly resent her inconvenient suicide but apparently expect us to reincarnate her . It 's as simple as that . I thought , if you did n't mind , I 'd take half an hour off tonight and wind up the whole business . " Susan , who had been watching the somber look behind his light words , pretended to study her watch . " I could spare you for twenty-eight or twenty-nine minutes , but thirty is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , no longer pretending to hide his concern . " Damn it , Susan , I 'm worried . " " Did you find anything at all in her cabin ? " asked Susan . CHAPTER THIRTEENIN ANSWER to Susan 's question Curtis shook his head . " Just routine corroboration of her suicide . No business papers , bankbooks . Nothing we hoped for . Just clothes , cablegram and suicide note , and my men damn near tapped her luggage to dust . Of course her final message amounts to a confession , but the stockholderswant their money . And you ca n't blame them . They 're all so mad that if it were n't such a straight  --  though peculiar  --  case of suicide , we 'd be inclined to think one of them murdered her . " Susan was looking bright . " In books , it would n't be decent psychology for an Alma Peters to take her own life . " " Life has a way of lacking logic . " " Death too ? " Curtis grimaced . " The suite was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suicide note has been expertly identified . " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 83 " How neat and orderly . I should think a ship 's cabin would be full of millions of fingerprints . " " This one was , my child  --  steward 's and stewardess 's . Dozens of unidentifiable ones  --  probably former passengers . Probably the maid 's  --  the one who came aboard at Le Havre to unpack her . We have n't tracked her down yet . But the point is that suspicion would raise its ugly head if the cabin had been wiped clean of the parade of people who have used it . We get lots of smudged prints in the detection business , but when they are no earthly use to us we find beauties in the most surprising places . You 'd be amazed at the number of people who evidently stretch up and leave prints even on their ceilings  --  when they 're low . " " The people , you mean , Mr Curtis ? " " No , Miss Yates . " " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan was feeling restless and uneasy . But , trying to maintain her light tone , she asked : " So you do have to identify people ? I mean when they go and shoot themselves ? " " Oh , very much so . It 's part of the job . Miss Peters ' butler , her secretary and her oldest employee at the laboratory did that for us on the ship this afternoon . The O.E. had been with Alma Products for nineteen years . Only person we could find who 'd known her that long . Very pretty employment turnover there , but this old chap seems to have known too well how to mix lipsticks and crow's-feet removers to get fired . Probably knew more about it than Peters did herself . Nice old fellow . How he hated that ship 's morgue . Sergeant Withers was telling me they practically had to carry him in and out . " " I bet I saw him , " exclaimed Susan , looking wise . " Did Sergeants Withers and McQuire bring him up to the suite while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thicklensedglasses , looking scared ? " " Master sleuth ! Yes , I had him brought up to the suite to84 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITidentify , in addition to others , her handwriting on the suicide note . I suppose one should n't ask what you were doing hanging around the alleyway . Passengers from that end of the ship were supposed to be detained over passport details . " " Nobody told me anything about it . The passport man was extremely nice to me . I think he liked the color of my eyes . " " Wise guy . " " But why all the fuss about identifying Alma ? " " My little one , in all cases of such convenient suicides  --  when persons are about to be arrested  --  we make damn certain there 's no shenanigan business over mistaken identities . We had the oldest employee because her butler was a recent one . With her only a week or so before she sailed . We had her secretary because " " Let me guess , " interrupted Susan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be frivolous . Because she was her secretary . A very snippy one too , I might say . Started out by saying she did n't especially know what her late employer looked like . " " Lyle , I can almost believe it ! " " Believe it ? Do n't you know what your secretary looks like ? " " Yes , but the time I visited Alma Peters in her office I found her a very strange woman . She was a strange woman , Lyle . Her office was all green  --  walls , ceiling , rugs , even the lights had green shades . Astral , she looked . " " Well , she was n't . She was a damn shrewd criminal . If she had n't been , I 'd say she was nuts . Her secretary claimed she even dictated over interoffice telephones . Very mysterious . " Susan nodded sagely . " She wanted to match colors with me over a telephone . That , I thought , was going too far . Not practical . But , Lyle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board the Island of England at Le Havre that perhaps all that remote , exclusive business was n't just a superpublicity stunt . She , looked  --  well , almost sad , as if she might be afraid of people , MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 85though I must say she looked surprisingly pleasant after death . Do you think she had a secret inferiority complex ? " Mr Curtis exploded : " I do not ! I think she had more nerve than nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand women out of a million . " " I see what you mean , " grinned Susan meekly , " but to get back to your tale , you had the secretary , the butler and the oldest employee all identify her . I must say the fact that anybody had worked for her for nineteen years is the most incredible thing of all . I was really amazed when that little manicurist on the ship spoke so kindly of her . She was the last woman in the world I would have suspected of being beloved by her em-ployees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right " They were interrupted by the telephone ringing . Itwas for Curtis , Lillian informed them from the hall door . He came back presently , saying it had been Withers . No trace of Lucinda 's dog . They had practically unpaved West Street . Again the phone rang . This time for Susan . It was Lucinda , very much excited . A man from a near-by gasoline station had just rung up , saying they had Oscar II . Was n't it amazing ! Think of the little darling walking all the way to Glen Cove , dragging his leash behind him . Yes , she admitted , she was quite tight . She had been worrying horribly , and now she had to dash , but she took an extra moment to remonstrate with Susan : " Darling , I 'm going to be simply furious with you if you knew all the time that Alma Peters had committed suicide at sea . I 've just read about it in the evening papers . I really believe you and Ethan both knew all along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's been in all the New York papers for five days , my butler says . Well , tell Lyle his men wo n't have to drag the North River now . Good-by , pet . " Susan replaced her receiver and strolled back to her drawing room chuckling . How could she ever have suspected Lucinda of being the figure with the following shadow on the boat86 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITdeck ? And perhaps whoever it had been had not really been stalking her . So she merely explained lightly to Curtis that Oscar II was reported found . " You have , " observed Mr Curtis , " some of the damnedest female friends . " Susan was relieved of a retort by the telephone ringing once more . It again was for Curtis . He returned after a few moments to report that the F.B.I . was having its troubles too . Bob Thorntonsaid they had n't found a trace of cocaine on the Island of England . Had had to decide their tip was a phony . Susan and Lyle went on chatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted . It was Miss Mason calling Miss Yates . Susan was back in a moment holding her sides . " Lyle ! Lucinda 's in a state . That dog was n't Oscar II ! He was wearing her cocker 's custom-made leash , harness and collar , and he was a cocker , but he was n't Oscar . Can you tie it ? As if there are n't enough mysteries floating around , we 've got to have mysteriousgoings on in the canine realm . " Curtis burst out laughing . " Good lord , that woman and her dogs ! Whose dog was it if it was n't hers ? " " She does n't know ! I judged it was a very inferior beast . Something wrong with its ancestry , coloring , eyes , ears , nose and teeth . Curiouser and curiouser , as Alice said . " Mr Curtis stopped laughing and looked exasperated . " Look here , Susan . If she calls back , tell her to get in touch with the city pound and the police . The district attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has . It seems she does n't trust you any more . Is even inclined to think your office capable of playing practical jokes . " " We are . On ourselves , " remarked Mr Curtis without relish . When Susan finally got to bed and asleep she began an apparently endless dream . Her room was filled with huge and rakish lifeboats . They floated about like death barges , and in each one of them stood a shadowy figure with a raven 's headMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 87and a long black tail . Each figure held a dark green cocker spaniel wearing a Tuxedo jacket . Susan woke with a start . The same old warning was playing its dismal tune at the back of her mind , and she wished she had , after all , told Lyle Curtis of her queer impression of an enemy on the ship and perhaps ashore . CHAPTER FOURTEENOVER HER BREAKFAST TRAY next morning Susan read the clippingsLyle Curtis had left with her the night before . They were fiveday-oldnewspaper accounts of Alma Peters ' suicide at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's distinguishedplace in the cosmetic industry , her twenty years of building the business . It was stated that she had founded Alma Products when but twenty years old , that she had been the only child of a Mr and Mrs David Peters , long deceased , who had resided without apparent distinction in Chicago . The father had once been a miner in the Klondike  --  an unsuccessful miner evidently . The parents had died in an accident when Alma was only sixteen and appeared to have left her no patrimony whatsoever . It was understood that she had worked for a time in a Chicago department store and subsequently had traveled for a Midwestern cosmetic house before moving to New York , creating the formulae for her first beauty aids and founding Alma Products , later incorporated . She was described as the " mystery woman " among career women . She had belonged to no business nor professional organizations , had played a " lonewolfgame in commerce . " The accounts mentioned that the district attorney 's office was in process of investigating certain discrepancies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Attorney Scofield and his assistant , Lyle Curtis , in charge of the Alma Products investigation , had made88 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITthis announcement when releasing to the press the content of Alma Peters ' suicide note . The latter was printed in full . Lillian brought in the morning papers as Susan finished reading the clippings . On the front page of the first one she opened was a retouched photograph of Alma Peters , captioned , " Taken When Dead Body Arrived by SS Island of England Yesterday . " Susan shuddered . There was something horrible about postmortemphotography , she thought , especially when the papers ' art departments added their ideas of properly comely touches to inanimate expressions . The face which stared back at her had none of the corpse 's half-pleased expression but a look of startling seductiveness . Hastily she put both clippings and morning papers aside . But later , in her bath , she glanced over the morning Globe . The bookkeeper of Alma Products , Inc. , and the treasurer of the company had been indicted the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the props under a misappropriationprogram , engineered by Alma Peters , through which stockholders had been defrauded of considerably more than three million dollars in corporate funds , and , as a result of which , the corporation had paid unnecessarily reduced dividends over a period of more than three years . The Globe added : " The true bill handed up to the judge by the grand jury foremanrelated in legalistic language how Miss Peters and her suspected confederates are believed to have burdened the cosmeticconcern with a largely fictitious warehouse operation in various Caribbean islands , through which unlawful profits were sucked out . Defendants will be arraigned for pleading sometimenext week . " The news story went on to rehash the tale of Alma Peters ' unexpected and dramatic suicide at sea following her receipt of an unsigned cablegram from New York City warning her of pending indictment . The others under indictment claimed to have no knowledge of where the misappropriated funds had been deposited . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 89Susan sighed and finished her bath thoughtfully . Lyle had n't even mentioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard the Island of England ; and , with it all , he 'd found time to fill her apartment with flowers . When Miss Yates arrived at her shop later in the morning she was greeted by an excited staff . The return of the head from Europe was always an occasion for speculation , not only along purely personal lines as to how the boss would look  --  if she 'd be doing her hair differently , speaking Turkish or something  --  but , in the fashion-imbued atmosphere of the establishment , even graver speculations over Miss Yates 's opinions concerning new trends in the mode . After suitable greetings throughout the salons and workrooms , Susan closeted herself with her secretary , Miss Button , and Ruby Holt . Ruby was feeling more morally indignant than physically injured as a result of her experience at the pier . First of all , she wanted to give a good account of her activities during Miss Yates 's absence . As she talked , her eyes bright with enthusiasm , Susan found herself recalling that since the first time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her involvement in the murder the year before of Nancy Pierce , the girl had impressed her as being both consummately and naturally chic and possessed of a large quantityof sound common sense . Both of these qualities Ruby had previously camouflaged under a wealth of purely extraneous commonness , but , with a bit of smoothing off of grammatical habits , Susan felt she had succeeded in making of her both an eminently keen saleswoman and a mannequin of extreme worth . Her report completed , Ruby turned again to the episode of the pier . " Miss Yates , I 'm sure  --  sure as anything  --  I 'd know that guy in the chofer 's uniform if I saw him again . " For business purposes solely Susan said : " Man , Ruby . Not guy . And you might as well struggle with sha-fur , since you fancy the word . It goes such a long way with clients who are90 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITstill saying lon-g &-ray;  --  and you are doing most capably with its correct pronunciation . " Ruby grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yates , you never make me feel a nut for saying things wrong . It 's swell working for you , but just the same , if I ever see that smart guy again , I 'll tell him a thing or two . " Susan remarked that she was afraid Ruby would do just that . Then , smiling , she turned to her secretary who sat with an open ledger of debits and credits before her . Business was , she saw , poor , but it could be worse . Susan Yates , Inc. , American Fashionswas n't exactly on its way to the poorhouse . But it occurred to Susan , nevertheless , that she , less than Lucinda Mason , could afford to spurn the business promised by Miss Edith Dalton and Mrs Camilla Richmond . If they spent as lavishly as they talked it would help keep the books in the black . A good many presumablysuccessful dress shops around New York were very much in the red these days . They were interrupted by the ringing phone . Miss Yates 's secretary answered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Miss Mason , Miss Yates . " " I 'll take it , " murmured Susan reaching for the receiver . Lucinda was already talking , having naturally not waited forassurance of an audience : " . . . and there he was , the littleduck , wearing basement bargain equipment but sound as a nut . " " I take it , " Susan finally managed to break in , " that you arespeaking of Oscar . He 's shown up , has he ? " " But , my pet , I 've been telling you ! Right on the doorstep of my shop when I got here ten minutes ago . Wagging his tail . Just sitting there waiting for me . Can you imagine ? Did you ever hear of such a thing ? Sitting right on Fifty-seventh Street . Out all night , he must have been . But it rained , and he was dry as a martini . I ask you , did you ever hear of such a thing ? What does it mean ? " Miss Mason sounded hysterical with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must haveMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 91lost a dog , then found yours and  --  oh , good heavens , then why would the dog last night have had Oscar 's equipment on ? I give up . Maybe somebody actually intended to steal Oscar because he was valuable . Perhaps they were stupid enough to think you would n't recognize the difference if they returned any old cocker spaniel . That does seem a little thick , but still what else could it be ? Obviously , Oscar must have escaped and like a sensible dog chose to look you up at the shop instead of racing clear out to Long Island . I agree , Lucinda , it 's terribly queer . " " Queer ? " screeched Miss Mason . " It 's an outrage . I intend to get to the bottom of it . " " Luck to you , but I do n't see how you 'll do it . " Lucinda sounded dark . " I shall think of something to do . " After listening to quite a bit more of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Mason had stated that the shipboard group was being bid to dinner the day after tomorrow . Then , in a tumultuous whisper , Lucinda confided that both Leslie Carleton and Edith Dalton had promised to buy cockers from her kennel . " And , my dear , I intend to start right in working on Edith Dalton to take an apartment straight off instead of waiting until midwinter or some silly time like that . This is only September . I think she 's got money  --  that girl . No reason at all why she should n't keep it in circulation . I shall do her the most devastatingly froufrou apartment you ever heard of . Garlands of lace everywhere . " A little weakly , Susan managed to say : " I do n't think I shall mind designing her a few froufrou little gowns , the way businesslooks . " On this frank note of commerce , they replaced their receivers . Gleaning from her employer 's conversation with Miss Mason that Oscar II had shown up , Ruby Holt took occasion to repeat to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  who tripped her . But in the midst of this she had to leave the room to greet the first customer of the morning . It was no92 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITother than the froufrou Miss Dalton . With what Ruby identified as silly snobbishness , Miss Dalton pretended not to remember their meeting on the pavement outside the pier . Ruby had to say : " Oh , Miss Dalton . You know I met you yesterday ! " Miss Dalton continued to look vague and snooty . " I want to see Miss Yates about some clothes I promised to buy . " Ruby 's red hair coming to the fore , she asked in a tone of distinctelegance : " What particular part of your wardrobe did you wish to enlarge ? " It turned out to be a topcoat that Miss Dalton must have immediately . She 'd had no idea American Septembers could be so chilly . Ruby nodded , still with elegance , and went off to select some Yates coats for town wear , having ascertained by psychic means known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated coat in New York . As she left the client Miss Yates appeared and greeted Miss Dalton with warmth  --  Lucinda 's greedy credo still ringing in her ears . " How very nice of you to come at once to me . I was just on the phone with Miss Mason . Her dog 's been found . " " Her dog ? " gurgled Miss Dalton , managing to convey the impression that she had only just heard of the existence of animals of that name . " Yes , you know , Oscar the II who got lost at the pier yesterdaywhen someone tripped my assistant , Miss Holt . " " Oh , dear me , yes . So he 's been found ? " Susan explained . " But , " said Miss Dalton , " fancy that . Right on her doorstep ! " At that moment Ruby Holt returned with one of the best of the current Yates models on her back . Miss Dalton glanced at it with very tepid interest  --  as if it were too unimportant a coat to command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said to Susan , completely ignoring Ruby . " Nothing horrid and plain like that . " She stirred impatiently and said rapidly : " On second thought , really there 's no point in my looking at a lot of everydayMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 93models like this . What I really want is for you to design somethingespecially for me . Nothing tawdry . I like exciting clothes  --  braid or ruffles  --  perhaps some simply lamby little bows of fur all up and down the front . " She permitted her voice to trail off indefinitely and rose . " I 'll just run along , " she drawled with a childish pout , " and give you time to think up something exceptionalfor me . Suppose I look in on you tomorrow or the next day ? " Susan had raised and lowered her brows and decided that silly women had to be catered to these days more than ever . Edith Dalton was evidently going to make her earn her profits . Sighing inwardly , she escorted Miss Dalton tenderly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , casting , meanwhile , distinctly disparaging glances after the departingcustomer . " The cat ! " she hissed . " Nothing tawdry ! Whateverthat means . " An hour later , her mouth full of pins and Ruby Holt on a designing-room dais before her , Susan was once more interrupted by a telephone call from Lucinda Mason . It was Susan 's opinion that most people swore because of insufficient vocabularies , but she nevertheless said fervently : " Hell ! If it 's any more about Oscar II , I wo n't talk . " Her secretary said that Miss Mason had said it was extremely important . Susan went gingerly to an extension phone . Lucinda sounded crisply businesslike . Leslie Carleton was with her . He had a wonderful promotion idea . Susan could have it made for a few cents and sell it for probably fifteen dollars . Was she in-terested ? " Whatever it is sounds indecently profitable . What does one do to be taken into the scheme ? " " Come over and Leslie will buy us our luncheon , " Lucinda announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit you ? " Susan said yes. 94 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITAt one o'clock promptly Miss Yates parked her smart roadster in front of Mason Interiors . Lucinda and Carleton were closeted together in the former 's extremely chic office . Miss Mason appeared to be in a fine mood of broad-shouldered , efficient coyness . To herself Susan said : " My girl , you are n't the type for ladylike archness . " Aloud she asked what the **34;6325;TOOLONG was . Lucinda gushed : " You tell her , Leslie . It 's your brain child . " Watching Carleton waive responsibility with lavish politeness , Susan thought : " He 's not the least bit in love with Lucinda . " It was something undefinable about him  --  a touch of caution in his gallantry , the dissembling his eyes seemed constantlyengaged upon . She was certain Leslie Carleton was merely playing with Ethan 's wife  --  either to amuse himself or for some more obscure reason . Perhaps because he was a gigolo at heart . Pressed by Lucinda he said : " You Americans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your extraordinary brains make a financial coup de ' maitre of it like lightning . My story is that , when I was a small lad , my father used to keep a place in Switzerland  --  a chalet , you know . We used to go there on holidays to climb . I had a Saint Bernard  --  splendid animal . Great favorite of mine . Tremendous favorite . I called him Saint Simeon . Nothing was too good for him . I was no end keen about him , matter of fact . Some of the peasants in our part of the Alps used to design big clumsy hearts , and crosses , crude canes . That sort of thing . Sold them to the trippers . I fetched up one day with the idea that I wanted Saint Simeon to wear a wooden heart on his collar  --  a heart as large as his own heart . Naturally I had no very clear notion how large that was , but one of the peasants whittled one out for me . My mother was touched . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the next Christmasshe sent off my wooden heart to a silversmith  --  London , Vienna . I do n't recall . Saint Simeon 's heart , in any case , was reMURDERON THE FACE OF IT 95produced in silver , and he wore it until his dying day . " Carleton paused , the outline of a choke in his voice . " He was killed  --  an avalanche . We found his body days later and  --  Until now I 've never wanted another dog . But I have always kept the heart by me , and now I 've grown so extraordinarily fond of Mrs Van Weck 's delightful little cocker spaniel I find I really want to own another dog  --  one of hers . I mentioned that he should wear Saint Simeon 's heart on his collar . It was then Mrs Van Weck had her inspiration . " Lucinda demurred a bit more , then , with a return of her customary energy , took charge of the brain-storm aspects of the subject . With brief sharp strokes she outlined the idea . Carleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her favorite costume-jewelry manufacturer and have it copied inexpensively  --  then sell it at an extremely good price as the last word in canine chicness . She could make duplicate motifs for mistresses of dogs to have on their handbags . She could Saint Simeonize New York . Every smart canine in Greater New York would feel nude without his Saint Simeon heart . No woman with , say , fifteen dollars would permit her dog to be seen without one . It was very jolly . Thinking it over , Susan agreed . A tremendous number of women went shopping with their dogs . You could induce women to buy accessories these days when you could n't sell them clothes . Yes , she was for it . What about commissions ? Carleton looked shocked , but Lucinda promptly pointed out that naturally Susan must pay them a commission . She 'd forget all about the idea otherwise . Susan smiled to herself , knowing Lucinda would no more give away a business proposition than she would , at the moment , be likely to stand on her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his hotel for his silver heart and come along to Susan 's to meet her costume-jewelry man . She rang up her secretary to make the latter arrangement and , after Lucinda had finished doing her lips , they started off for luncheon . Glancing at Miss Mason , 96 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITSusan saw she was wearing the same idiotic shade of lipstick fancied by Miss Edith Dalton . " Good heavens , " she thought . " This Carleton must be a devastatingman . Funny I ca n't see it . When I start painting my lips into cupid bows I 'll know I 've fallen too . " Carleton had seemed a bit keen about the Dalton person , but it was scarcely good sense for the big-boned Lucinda to start emulating her appearance and going about looking as if she were suffering from a case of fallen archness . Susan thought suddenly of Alma Peters ' vivid lips , and as usual this brought her thoughts to a kind of frozen mental standstill . Would she never be able to rid herself of that hideouslyinterested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office after luncheon Ruby Holt vaporized rather violently over meeting Mr Leslie Carleton . Susan shrugged and wondered again what it was about the man . She must remember to ask for one of Ruby 's blunt explanations . But later Miss Holt was not as informative as usual . Her reactions seemed to lose themselves in the fact that he was elegant and " spoke Englishas it ought to be spoke . " The jewelry man , a Mr D. Cobheim , agreed that the Saint Simeon heart could be practically reproduced . Susan explained that she had telephoned her lawyer and the fashion-design bureau to obtain registration coverage on the item as an exclusivefor her shop . She wanted a contract with the jewelry manufacturerassuring her sole retail sales rights . As soon as the business details were settled Mr Cobheim departed , and Susan was called to one of the fitting rooms . Mr Carleton began gatheringup his hat , stick and gloves . " You staying long in New York , Mr Carleton ? " Ruby inquired with blissful hopes in her tone . " Perhaps all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have a good time , " volunteered Ruby . As an afterthought , she added in her best salon manner : " New YorkMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 97is enchanting . Especially in the winter season . So gay . " It would have been easier and pleasanter to have said : " New York is swell , " but Mr Carleton was such a gentleman and everything . CHAPTER FIFTEENIN THE CANDLELIGHT the Van Weck ancestral drawing room whispered softly of its eighteenth-century origin . It was the supreme achievement in a house which had graced Long Island long before New York 's upper Fifth Avenue was dreamed of as a mansion paradise . Susan Yates , in a square-necked , long-sleeved , black velvet dinner gown , sat alone before the stately fireplace . Lucinda 's butler had just laid a fresh log and retired to announce her . Susan , studying the room 's fine proportions , its pilastered corners and noble windows , was thinking of a great-great-aunt of hers who had spurned a wedding-present plot of ground which she had considered quite ridiculously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fashionable house on StuyvesantPark . The other property , as a later Fifth Avenue site , had brought a cool million dollars  --  some fifty times more than the wedding present had totaled . But that had been long after the turn of the century . Susan was glad that Lucinda had not changed the Van Weck drawing room . An ardent exponent of art moderne , Lucinda , nevertheless , had but slightly altered Ethan 's house , displaying an unexpected respect for things grown mellow and beautiful with years of affectionate use . There was a swishing of taffeta at the door , and Lucinda stood there . She came quickly across to Susan . " Lyle did n't come out with you then ? " " No . His life 's scarcely his own at the moment , but he expected to be here by eight . A client of mine in Oyster Bay98 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IToffered to drop me off if I did n't mind an early start . So here I am . This way Lyle and I can drive back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this room is beau-tiful . " Miss Mason 's mouth went suddenly curiously hard . Almost angrily , she remarked : " I wonder how many people live in houses unsuited to them ! I know this house is as unlike me as a grasshopper is unlike a turtle . But "  --  and her green eyes grew thoughtful  --  " while it does n't in the least look like Ethan , it is like him . There 's something in having grown up with things , damn it ! I admit environment tells ! Sometimes I wish to God I 'd had the good luck of a family tree and the inner assurance that goes with knowing your people have always been some-body . " Susan was looking at her with amazement . The anger in her tone was too close to being pathetic . She had never before heard the broad-shouldered , eminently successful decorator reveal even a layer of sentiment  --  or sense of inferiority . Good naturedness , a willingness to co-operate for a fair price  --  yes , those qualities Lucinda had . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem a little lost without them was , indeed , as unlike Lucinda as was the room . With quick casualness Susan asked : " Are n't you at least a quarter of a century behind the times ? I thought the latest thing in family trees was the modern sapling of achievement . Today it 's more fashionable , is n't it , to look into the matter of what rather than who people are ? " For immediate answer Miss Mason strode across the room and began to rearrange a bouquet of hothouse roses that stood on a grand piano . For a moment she lingered over it , her back to Susan . Then she turned and chuckled , her mood apparently abruptly changed . With her customary look of independence she returned to the fireplace . There was not a trace of anger or pathos in her expression . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 99 " It is fun , " she exclaimed , " having a florist 's shop practically attached to the house . Want to know something , Susan ? I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then , like a swallow plunging , she demanded : " Are you going to marry Lyle Curtis , Susan ? Do you think he 'll ever be rich ? " The double question put so unexpectedly rather took Susan 's breath . She wrinkled her nose and hesitated before replying . Lucinda was such a chatterer ! " Do n't tell me , " she laughed after a moment , " that some columnist is paying you to squeal career-gal tidbits ? If so , inform him that you could n't pry a word out of me . ' " Nothing at all to say , " said Miss Yates ! ' " Lucinda scrutinized her intently and in silence . Then she sank back into a chair opposite her guest , a small frown puckering her brow . After another long moment she said lightly : " Skip it . Let 's have cocktails now instead of waiting for the others . " Rising , she pulled a handsomely embroidered bell rope by the mantel . While they waited for the cocktails Leslie Carleton , suave and wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heels came Mrs Camilla Richmond in a very subtle shade of brownish gray , a mauve not unlike the shading of her own skin . It made her look curiously unclothed and seductive . She and Carleton had not come together . She had been in a taxi followinghis from the station , she explained in her softly guttural voice , her brilliant eyes queerly on Carleton ; and she did not smile , even the smile that touched only her lips , when he said urbanely : " What a pity , I did not see you . " There was gentility but no warmth in her guttural , " Yess . What a pity . " At that instant Miss Edith Dalton was announced and made her appearance , a mass of narrow ruffles and fussy jewelry . From the doorway she began remonstrating archly that it was very silly indeed they had not all come together . She had seen everyI00 MURDERON THE FACE OF ITbody getting into different taxis and had n't been able to catch up . Then she spied the roses to whose arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What an adorable room and what heavenly flowers ! " she exclaimed . Swaying her plump hips , she teetered across to the piano on quite the highest heels Susan remembered ever having seen and buried her cupid-bow lips in the bouquet . Susan thought that , if she 'd only dress more suitably , she 'd be a really attractive woman . Her kittenish ways and line of idiot 's dalliance had at times such an air of youthfully artless sincerity that it was difficult entirely to dislike her . Only women like Miss Dalton and Lucinda really were too old to be such fools . Thinking this , Susan 's eyes happened to fall on Leslie Carleton , standing opposite her , half leaning against the regal mantel . A cigarette burned unnoticed between two fingers . His position was negligent , but in his eyes was an intense expression . They were resting on the overelaborate Edith Dalton . Susan was taken by surprise , but there could be no doubt about it : in that quick second she had made a discovery . Interest she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noons before glowed there now as he watched Miss Dalton . So that was the way the wind blew ! But fancy the silly gurgly sort catching the debonair Carleton ! Susan turned to hear what Mrs Richmond was saying . She was talking to Lucinda . " Miss Dalton is right , " she said as if discovering Miss Dalton right about anything were an achievementin itself . " This room is enchanting . I entirely adore it . " Her vivid eyes moved over the furniture , then slowly back to Leslie Carleton , and Susan was certain she , too , had caught that earlier expression on his face  --  an expression now carefully erased . Ethan appeared suddenly at the door saying : " Lyle Curtis has arrived , Lucinda . " Curtis came in , looking almost haggard . After general greetingshe started toward Susan smiling bleakly . Ethan had fallenMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I01into an immediate low-voiced conversation with Camilla Richmond . Lucinda had turned to Carleton . In the brief moment before she looked up at Lyle Susan had noticed that Ethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with little or no stammer . " Hello , Susan ! " said Lyle . " Do I look the wreck I feel ? " " Poor darling , has it been " But Miss Dalton interrupted . From her carefully retained station at the piano she cried : " Oh , Mr Curtis , you simply must come and smell theseheavenly roses ! " Curtis looked too tired to do anything but obediently obey . He did , throwing to Susan over his shoulder a low-voiced : " Back in a minute . " But Miss Dalton , having accomplished an objective , was less eager to relinquish it . She immediately entered into what appeared to Susan to be a very remarkable conversation . " Mr Curtis , you really look simply exhausted . I do n't want to sound silly , but I have the most tantalizing inclination to stroke that tired forehead of yours . But in America , I see , women never do spontaneous things like that . Other women think they are dreadful if they do . I see it in their eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she could not fail to hear the rest : " On the other hand , I 'm not sure that American women comforttheir men the way Europeans do . I always say that , when a man comes away from his affairs of the day , he should find either comfort or gaiety  --  and that usually he prefers comfort ! I suppose tonight you are resigned to being gay ? " Lyle , Susan imagined , had sighed , although she could n't be sure , but , risking another quick glance back at him , she read his expression as saying that that was exactly what he had resignedhimself to : cocktails , dulled weariness , an illusion of effervescence . What he was saying was : " Well , you ca n't go around dying on people 's hands . " IO2 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " You have such detachment , " cooed Miss Dalton . " I 've often wished I were a man  --  an important man of the world . " On this remarkable disclosure Susan forced herself to abandoneavesdropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tray of cocktails , and Leslie Carleton moved nearer to Susan . He spoke with clipped politeness : " Will you permit me to admire your gown , Miss Yates ? It is definitely the most delightful one I remember seeing . " Almost crossly Susan said : " One should never see a gown , Mr Carleton . One should see how it makes a woman look . " If Carleton had been the hand-clapping sort , he would have done so , she was certain . He appeared extravagantly pleased by what he chose to call : " An excellent tip . How very dull of me . Live and learn , eh ? And that , I fancy , is what I did see but had not the temerity to say so . " He took the wind out of her sails so pleasantly that presently she permitted herself to be led into dinner on his arm in quite a good humor . After Lucinda 's excellent dinner they visited her kennels , where Miss Dalton and Carleton both ended by buying halfgrowndogs . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself thinking : " We pretend to be gay together . We talk about amusing memories from the Atlantic passage , but we really are n't a congenial lot . It will be absurd if we keep this social business alive . " But Carleton had already insisted that they must all come to dinner with him the next Monday , and Miss Dalton had said she was n't going to wait to get her apartment . She would have a party at her hotel . Mrs Richmond alone remained withdrawn from the general conversation . She murmured indefinitely that later they must dine with her , but she seemed really only interested in talking to Ethan , whom she had devoted herself to throughout dinner . In the kennel her eyes , hard and brilliant , had seemed to find amusement in Carleton 's purchase ofMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I03a dog . Susan wondered why . What was there about the suave Carleton that so frequently etched irony on Mrs Richmond 's face ? Really , they were all a queer lot . There was no sense in starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow unaccountably uneasy about it . Surely just because they had met on shipboard was a very feeble reason for all these plans to meet again and again . Mrs Richmond 's voice interrupted her thoughts . Lucinda had evidently  --  her eye on another sale  --  asked her if she were n't interested in dogs . " No , not at all , " said Mrs Richmond . " They are a trouble . If they are stupid , they are not amusing , and if they are intelligent they are even more of a nuisance . " " For Lucinda that is h-heresy , " chirped Ethan . He seemed rather delighted . " Your dogs are very nice to look at , " added Mrs Richmond , evidently in an effort to palliate Lucinda 's offended expression . But the remainder of the evening dragged . Susan found an unreasonable pleasure in seeing Lyle Curtis yawn politely behind a hand once when Miss Dalton was saying something . At eleven o'clock she suggested departure , looking at Lyle . But it immediatelydeveloped that Miss Dalton had already brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridiculous way in which they had all come out from town separately and had apparently impressed upon him the ecstasy he would afford her were he to invite them all to return in his official car . It appeared that Miss Dalton had never been in an official car . The prospect filled her with excited yearnings . While Lyle did not seem to be ecstatic over the plan , he did not side-step it . In the hall , as they were saying good-bys , Lucinda remarked that if Mrs Richmond and Miss Dalton were going to get themselveswardrobes at Susan Yates , Inc. , they would have to submit to having stuffed dummies of themselves made . " Susan 's got the most unflattering one of me , " she said . " I look exactly like a football practice bag , or whatever they call those things . Inhuman , anyway . " 104 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITEveryone laughed , and Miss Dalton insisted coyly that no one  --  simply no one  --  was going to have such an opportunity to laugh at her behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you up . We ca n't all be so divinely slender as Mrs Richmond . " Mrs Richmond cast her a quick look . It was true that the brilliant-eyed Camilla was almost emaciated in her slenderness . Susan said hastily : " Well , we do n't put you on display in your alter egos , you know . " Lucinda , still apparently in a waggish turn of mind , insisted : " But you put Christmas-present kind of cards on each dummy telling who each one is . A burglar stealing into your workroom could pretty well estimate how we all look in our baths . " Ethan said : " There are swimming parties for that  --  the w-way ladies d-dress these days . " Mrs Richmond looked at Lucinda and from her to Susan , remarking negligently : " One gets used to the custom of couturierdummies in Paris . One submits to these things . Is it so odd ? " Lucinda chuckled . She was a little tight and very pleased over the sale of the two dogs , so she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick little motion of displeasure . " I 've gone to the best couturiers for years , but they 've never had to make artificial mannequins in order to fit me . " " It 's because you 're even , darling , " giggled Miss Mason , turningher canny eyes on her high-bosomed guest . " I can always tell when windows or doors or lintels or people are out of balance . It 's one reason I 'm a good decorator . I 've really got an eye for such things . I 'd say you 're balanced . " Ethan looked a little shocked , blew his nose and remarked hastily to Curtis : " You might take an armful of Susan 's er  --  ahdummiesand scatter them about in jewelry stores . M-might discourage forced entries . " Everyone laughed again , and Curtis said he must bring it toMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 105the attention of the police department ; no doubt they 'd go for it strongly . Watching his fine tired face , Susan thought : " Poor , poor darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to sit next him in the front seat if I have to push this Dalton creature in a ditch . Camilla Richmond 's not much better with her sharp tongue . I 'll forget about them in the car , shut my ears to everything they say . I 'm definitely going to sit in front with Lyle . " But Susan found that placing herself in the official car was easier to contemplate than to accomplish . In the driveway Miss Dalton took charge of arrangements . CHAPTER SIXTEENONE AFTERNOON , several weeks later , Susan found herself for the first time in her life figuratively crawling into a hole . She sat alone at her desk in her efficient but attractive private office and pointed this out to herself with no uncertain annoyance . As if her persisting premonitions were not enough , a very tangible uncertainty had arisen . Was Lyle Curtis interested in Edith Dalton , or was n't he ? To the contrary of her taste in clothes , Miss Dalton had , without doubt , both skill and finesse in attracting men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York had been adroitly if steadily waged . She had chosen to fasten on Curtis ' official activities a kind of Holy Grail implication . Lyle had become her Sir Galahad . Moreover , she was forever cropping up no matter where Susan and Curtis were , although , as a matter of fact , they had blessed few places together recently . Business had kept Susan 's nose to the grindstone , and the trial of those indicted in the Alma Products case had been going wearily on downtown . Curtis ' desk had been piled from dawn to dawn with work . Every time they did manIOC ) MURDERON THE FACE OF ITage an evening they were both dead tired . Yet Susan felt certain that now and again Mr Curtis found time to bask in the admiration  --  andreverence  --  of Miss Dalton . Nor could she say to him : " Look here , my angel , that female flatterer is trying to get you . " He might very well say : " Do you think I can be got if I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open warfare against Edith Dalton 's special weapons would be suicidal . Susan had tried to be unceasingly charming to her , permitting no barbed word to encourage the protective instinct Lyle might feel for a little woman ironically treated . It was her observation that men simply could n't resist championing pretty , naive women . But could she go on forever practically encouraging the presence of this little woman in the front row of her private life ? Of course the thing to do was to go on being herself . Certainly not by word or deed to give Lyle the impression that she was capable of thinking that old and exasperating bromide : " Men are such children . " Susan sighed and tapped a pencil irritably on the top of her desk . From the time of Susan 's own unexpected involvement in a murder case and becoming acquainted with Curtis until she had gone to Europe , Lyle and she had had a good many very comfortable , gay evenings alone . Now when they saw each other it was much too often at someone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Leslie Carleton , Lucinda and Ethan , Edith Dalton or even Camilla Richmond . Why in heaven 's name did they keep this silly group together ? Susan sat very still for several moments , then put out a hand to her phone and dialed the assistant district attorney 's private number . Curtis came on the wire after a brief delay . His voice sounded wretchedly tired . " Hello , " he said somewhat irritably . " Hello , Lyle . I 'm crazy perhaps , but I 'm dying for a long comfortableevening of just talk . Come to the apartment for dinner tonight . Let 's drop our work dragons . " There was a brief pause at the other end of the line ; thenMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I07Curtis ' voice , sounding oddly surprised , asked : " But what about Edith Dalton 's shindig ? " " Party ? " " I do n't understand , Susan . Are n't you going ? I only accepted last night . Did n't know before if I could get away . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Susan wanted to scream . She 'd been invited to no party . Well , better be diplomatic . She laughed , trying to sound casual , but it did n't quite come off and she knew it . " How funny , Lyle . I 'm a girl left out on a limb . Joke 's on me . You see , I have n't been asked . Perhaps Edith has thought better of having dressmakersat her formal affairs . " Damn . Of course that last crack had been definitely too sarcastic , and sarcasm was all too often compounded of one part insecurity and one part self-pity , which would be what Lyle would think . Lyle 's voice sounded reasonable , however , although the slightestbit provoked , as if he were thinking : " Oh lord , women and their feuds ! " But he said evenly : " If I remember rightly you 're a dressmaker with her name in the social register . Edith must just have failed to reach you . When I have a moment I 'll ring her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 'll do no such thing ! " It was out before she could stop the words . Regretting them at once , Susan added a little lamely : " I mean that would be silly . She may have just needed an extra man for some group of people I do n't know at all . " That was n't exactly a compliment to Lyle , but at this point she could n't help it . Ridiculously , she felt suddenly like crying . What was he saying ? " " You know she 's a scatterbrain , Susan . Look here , I 'll have my secretary call and say I 've got a wisdom tooth crashing through . What time will dinner be at your apartment ? " Susan thought : " I ca n't let him do it . I must n't ! It 's a bad mistake in strategy . Say : No , you simply must go to Edith 's . ' Say it , you idiot ! " But she did n't say it . She heard instead a voice soundingIo8 MURDER ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I 'll let you . " And then , most definitely , she did start crying . Not sobs , but certainlyanyone at the other end of the wire would know what was going on . It was awful , but also it was too dreadful , consideringevery word , every syllable , every tone , treating a man you respected and  --  well , one you were very fond of  --  as if he were a case in retarded development or a machine you had to oil to make go ! Curtis sounded dumfounded but suddenly very sweet . " What 's that blubbering I hear ? Susan , you goose ! Listen , the D.A . is bellowing for me , but I 'll be on your doorstep at seventhirtysharp unless the sky falls down here . Got to run . Behave yourself , child . " Dabbing at her eyes with one hand , Susan replaced the receiverwith the other . Now what fine kind of idiot had she made of herself ? Career women ! Blah ! She got up , went over to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done her make-up . Thing to do , she thought , was to stop thinking altogether . Leave the salon and shop flat . Go to a newsreel or something . Refuse standing room in her mind to one portion of one thought of Edith Dalton , Love , Intrigue , Clinging-Vine Glamour Girl  --  or Lyle Curtisfor at least an hour . That would give time to get reorganized before seven-thirty . Perhaps seven-thirty tonight was one of the most important engagements of her life . Melodramatic ? Well , dammit , sometimes life was melodramatic . But perhaps , at a newsreel , her subconscious would crash through with a nice , sound , brilliant anti-Dalton program . She plunked a hat on her head with entirely uncustomary heedlessness , rang for Ruby Holt , found that Mrs Froggingham Perrington had just come in demanding all the snaps and slide fasteners on a dinner gown changed to good old-fashioned hooks and eyes . " Handle her , Ruby . Do anything she asks . I 've got a deadlyMURDER ON THE PACE OF IT 109important appointment . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the curb Miss Yates eyed her speedy roadster with a kind of affection . Curious the way certain things  --  the gleam of soft lights on a friendly bookcase when you entered a room , the nostalgic call of a railroad whistle you 'd loved as a child , the sound of rain on a roof at the beginning of a storm you were secure from , or a thing of convenience like a responsive car  --  could comfort an unruly mood , could make you momentarily happy in the midst of mental turmoil ! Her roadster had taken her to many important appointments in the past year , to some definitely queer and criminally involved ones . This time , it was taking her to an appointment with herself , to a lesson in selfrestraint . But , to her agony , the same old treadmill of thoughts began their nagging revolutions in her brain as she drove south to the nearest newsreel theater . In exasperation she parked her car , paid for her ticket and buried herself in the darkened theater . There were the usual war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Pittman Bill meeting in Washington , Mussolini making a speech , a scene of desolation in Poland . Then the mood changed . There was a picture of a man said to be the only living eater of tin cans . Susan sniffed . The man was shown at one of his Spartan repasts , but she doubted it . Then there was a caption saying : " Paris Still Seeks Beauty , " and a whitecoateddoctor was pictured tattooing a new completion on a young woman , recoloring her lips , engraving a faint hue into her cheeks . Only it was n't a color newsreel . It looked as if the doctor were making the pretty patient black and white . Susan shudderedand thought how much more definitely painful than the outer trappings of war this unusual beauty treatment looked . She thought , also , that the same thing was true of death . A murder , ingeniously and fiendishly executed , was much more exciting than modern warfare with its machinelike mass murders . Then the complexion tattooer faded from the film and wasIIO MURDER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan settled back more relaxed . Perhaps it had not , after all , been so dumb to let Lyle come tonight . The next morning Susan told herself , as she opened her eyes , that she should do something about leaving a legacy to newsreeltheaters on her death . She had come out of that one yesterdayfeeling a better and more efficient member of the human race . And what a really satisfactory evening she had had with Lyle ! Arriving punctually at her apartment , he had said casually : " Do n't give my wisdom-tooth whopper away to Edith Dalton . And forgive me for sounding hellishly rushed with you . Life is no bed of roses downtown just now . " From then on the name of Edith Dalton had been carefully edited out of their conversation . It had been a definitely satisfactoryevening . She had managed a beautifully garbled explanation of why she had wept on the telephone . Susan yawned and turned to ring for her breakfast tray . The telephone stopped her hand . It was Leslie Carleton . " I 'm at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day , but I called you because I have what may be a wholesale order for the Saint Simeon silver hearts . Countryman of mine passing through town on his way to the coast . Wants twentyfiveto give hostesses in California . But he 's the kind of chap who turns everything on the basis of a pretty face . Wants to meet you . Will buy the hearts if he can say to people he knows you . Are you on ? Will you dine with us tonight and put the deal over ? " Susan hesitated . The dog hearts were going a bit downhill in sales now . They 'd been on the market  --  her exclusive market  --  for several weeks . It would be very pleasant to sell twentyfiveat once . But Lyle had asked her last night to go to the theater with him tonight . " Oh come , " she urged Carleton , " you can put it over yourself , ca n't you ? I 've got another engage-ment . " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT IIICarleton said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought perhaps he 'd talk the hearts up on the coast and you might receive more orders from people out there . Is n't that the way those things work ? " " Yes , " said Susan . " I suppose I should try to do it . You could n't manage it for tomorrow night instead ? " " Impossible . He 's leaving for the coast in the morning . " " All right . I 'll come . " Damn it , she thought , it 's always one thing or another interfering with my seeing Lyle . CHAPTER SEVENTEENFINISHING DINNER ALONE In his apartment instead of with MissYates , Curtis found himself wondering what sort of idiot bought handfuls of dog charms to circulate among California females . Undoubtedly a damn fool . Curtis rang somewhat irritably for Pauson , his all-purpose houseman . Pauson was slow in arriving . When he did it was with the information that a young lady was calling  --  a Miss Edith Dalton . " She asked me to say , sir , " Pauson announced with certain sadness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her call . She was in the neighborhood . " Curtis scowled . " I do n't suppose , Pauson , it occurred to you to say I 'd just gone off to join the Canadian army or on an expedition with Stefansson ? " Pauson was grave . " I 'm very sorry , sir . Unfortunately , I 've already put the young lady in the living room . " " It 's our best room , I suppose . Bring the brandy decanter . " Pauson hesitated , his eyes critically fixed on his well-polishedshoes . " The young lady , " he observed , " is just a little tired . " " Tired ? Good lord , so am I. Bring two decanters . " " I was only thinking , sir , that perhaps coffee  --  strong black coffee . . . " His words trailed to a dangling comma . II2 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITCurtis had reached the dining-room door . He wheeled about abruptly . " What 's that ? Well , I 'll be damned . The lady is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so attractively put it . Coffee , by all means  --  and the brandy . " Miss Dalton was curled girlishly in a big chair by the windows . She was wearing pale yellow  --  yards of pale yellow . But it was a dinner gown of great simplicity . Curtis wondered idly if it was that which made her look more than usually attractive . He remembered Lucinda Mason 's frank tongue saying Edith Dalton overdid her allegiance to ruffles . There were no ruffles tonight . Straight , alluring lines veiled her plump hips and high breasts . The gown might have been a long-sleeved , high-necked nightgown , but it had been made by a master . Its very discretion seemed to be projecting something he had not before seen in his guest . She seemed to appear and disappear beneath it as she made the slight motions of turning her head and body gently toward him . That was it : there was a new strength and a new gentleness about Edith Dalton tonight . She did not look just a silly flattering woman . She held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " My excuse is I was dining with a simply mad lot of people at the Savoy . I decided I was a little tight and ought to go home . I started ! Then I had to pass right by your door . You see , I an ' tight . I came in ! " Curtis laughed down into her eyes . " Very flattering . I 'm glad you did . " Again there was that evanescence about her as she curled once more into the confines of the chair . She did n't speak for a moment . Then : " I 'd never dare call on a bachelor alone if New York were n't such an informal place . " " Should attractive women always have their great-aunts along ? " demanded Curtis settling down in the chair opposite her . For immediate answer Miss Dalton curled still deeper in herMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I13chair , cuddling her knees with her chiffon-covered arms . The delicateness of those arms was more delicately conveyed than if they had been bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh as Susan 's  --  and said : " There 's no use my pretending . The room 's going round and round . " Her head wagged a little loosely . " Guess who were tete-a-teting at the Savoy . Susan and Leslie , having a simply grand time ! Lucinda would n't like it . Oh , Lyle , your room is revolving . The windows used to be over there two minutes ago , and I simply never gossip . " Watching her , Curtis thought : " Pauson is right . Only milk would be better than coffee . I do n't think she 's used to drinking much . " Then he became conscious of what she had said : " Susan and Leslie tete-a-teting . Where the devil was the dozens-of-dogcharmsguy ? " He made his expression noncommittal and said aloud : " What , dining alone in public ? The whole world is going to the dogs tonight . " " Meaning me coming here . I told you I was ashamed . I spend my whole life lately being ashamed . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchids . I did n't know they were that way . " " The orchids sound overdone , " said Curtis rather irritably . " Was she selling many dog charms ? " " I do n't know what you mean by that . They were just talking . " Abruptly Miss Dalton 's tone changed from a tipsy chattinessto tipsy grief . " You made me very miserable last night . " He hoped she was n't the sort who started weeping . " How ? " he asked . " But , of course , by not coming to dinner with me . The most painful thing in the world is being let down when you 've been about to do something completely brazen . " Her hands fluttered ingenuously . The gesture was naive and appealing , as if her artlessness was a matter of youth which she hoped to outgrow , a matter in which Curtis might take a controlling hand . " Brazen . Do n't be ridiculous . I did n't come because a wisdom tooth was acting up . " II4 MURDER ON THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was terribly sorry . But , Lyle , I might as well confess . It was not a party . I planned for us to dine alone . Just you and I. And that was brazen . Brazen and foolish . You probably think I 'm a fool . But  --  but I wanted to be able to tell people later  --  years later , when you are even more important  --  that you used to come to me and talk of your career  --  of your world ; that you asked my advice about  --  oh , tiny things , but counted on me for moments of relaxation  --  for moments away from everything . It would be so exciting to mean that to you , so wonderfully satisfying . " Her voice , softer than he remembered it being before , ended on a note which was at once caressingand self-chastising . It was as if she had for a second stroked his forehead and then clenched her hands in childish embarrassment . Curtis felt he ought to do something , ought to say : " Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted it fortunate that Pauson arrived at that moment with the coffee and brandy . Pauson made something of a ceremony about placing his tray , arranging the cups , putting brandy glasses beside the decanter . He withdrew ultimately with the sad expression of one who had nothing left to do . Pouring the coffee , Curtis saw that Miss Dalton was restless . He had said lightly , in Pauson 's presence : " They tell me people behind the scenes are often the real powers '  --  to coin a phrase . " And he had sensed a hurt look in her limpid eyes . Now , as Pauson 's footsteps retreated down the hall , she uncurled herself suddenly from the big chair and came and sat without apology on the arm of his . Presently she said : " You are always laughing at me , Lyle  --  as if you thought I would never grow up . " He thought : " Well , you 're not a child , my girl . You 're well past thirty . But you 're very sweet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly better than the selection of most coy women . " Whatever that is you 've got on , " he said , " smells good . " Edith sighed and , as if she were unconscious of her action , MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I15began running the fingers of one hand through his hair slowly , very slowly . " Do you like that ? " she asked after a moment . " Very much . " She was silent once more . For a moment her hand was quiet at the back of his neck . Very quiet and soft . Then she said slowly : " You ca n't know how terribly much I admire you  --  your work  --  everything you represent . Everything you are . " " Oh , come , Edith . I 'm just a gent , " Curtis exclaimed with a bit of embarrassment . " Have a brandy ? " He got up to fill the glasses , and her hand fell back in her lap , but her body remained relaxed , half lying in its trailing yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass to her across the coffee table , came around , after filling his own , and briefly rumpled her hair , arranged in its usual mass of baby ringlets . " Drink your brandy , " he instructed , standing looking down at her . She sighed again and sipped . A taxi hooted outside the win- dow , but inside the big and pleasant room was very quiet . Sev- eral moments of this quiet piled one on top the other ; then she asked : " Was it very dreadful of me to come here tonight ? " and looked up at him . " To the contrary . " She dropped her eyes to the glass and said nothing . Curtis sat down again in the chair beside her . " Matter of fact , I 'm glad you dropped in . I was feeling bored . " " You 're just being polite . " " Drink your drink . Did you have enough dinner ? Want Pau- son to push something together for you ? " " Oh , I could n't eat anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . I see it in your expression . " Curtis turned and grinned at her solemn face . " The expres- sion , " he explained , " is inherited . Several generations of Curtis family habit . " When she said nothing he decided to look for his pipe , got up and presently found it on a far table by the telephone . Then he found a humidor of tobacco and brought them both back acrossI16 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITthe room . He put the humidor down on the coffee table , leaned over and began filling the bowl of the pipe . Her perfume was still in the air , a curious fragrance . " You have very good hair , " he said , and , though it occurred to him , he did n't add : " and a very small waistline for your look of plumpness . " Still she said nothing , looking off into space , her breasts rising and falling under the pale bodice . He sat down in the chair once more , pushing the tobacco into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches toward an ash tray on the coffee table in the process . Miss Dalton began to hum a vague tune . She paused and said : " I like you , " then hummed some more , swinging one foot slowly . " Do you like me ? " Curtis looked around and grinned again . " You 'll do . I would n't make much of a salon lion for you though . Not my stuff . " With a quick gesture Edith twisted around on the arm of the chair so that she faced him . " What , " she demanded softly , " makes you so afraid of affection ? You distrust me because , when I feel affectionate , I do n't know how to hide it . Is that such a sin ? " Before he could answer she turned away again , making a sudden helpless gesture with her hands . For a moment she put them over her eyes ; then quickly she dropped them , slipped from the arm of the chair to her knees , buried her head on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh God . She is the weeping sort . And sweet . Damn it . " With some vigor he turned and began patting her face . " Come on . Get up . What did you drink at your dinner  --  absinthe ? " Miss Dalton still sobbed but with less lack of control . She drew away slightly , resting only her forehead on his shoulder now . " It is n't anything I drank . It 's just that you think I 'm a fool . " " What if instead I think you 're delicious ? " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I17Edith raised her head , blinked and found a handkerchief somewhere in the chiffon bodice . It , too , was pale yellow and enormous . She dabbed her eyes with it delicately . " But I am an idiot , " she insisted . Curtis laughed . Then he leaned over the chair arm , took her head between his hands for a moment and kissed her mouth . " No more crying . Rule of the house . " Her lips had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft . Moreover , they had clung to his with considerably more intensity than he had anticipated . She smiled happily now , dropped back on the floor from her knees and produced , from apparently nowhere , a compact from which she extracted a lipstick . Inspecting her face in the mirror , she made a few sure strokes on the cupid bows , smiled up at him again , replaced the lipstick and closed the compact . Her yellow chiffon skirt , he noticed , made a wide graceful fan on the carpet . He did n't think much of the lips , but the pose was charming . " That 's better , " he said vaguely . His guest 's eyes had returned to their faraway expression . She told him presently : " I do n't actually think you like hurting me . You just like to be  --  well , detached , I suppose . And I admire that terribly . I told you so that time at Lucinda Mason 's . Lyle ! I do n't believe you are ever going to hurt me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . Eyes resting on her bright hair , he thought that it was beautifulif foolishly dressed . " Hurt you ? Why should I ? " At the back of his thoughts he was thinking : " Susan need n't have pulled such a long story about a mythical buyer of dog hearts to break a date with me . Damn fool thing to do . Why should n't she have forty dinners with Carleton if she chooses to ? Queer , though . Susan 's generally so candid . It 's half her charm . But she 's a seductive wench too . She should n't go throwing herself away on punks like Carleton . Hell , what is there about Leslie Carletonthat 's so damn attractive to women ? " Then he became conscious that Edith Dalton was strokingI18 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IThis hand , softly , a little timidly , and that the telephone bell was ringing down the hall . Pauson 's dignified steps sounded . They paused at the open door . Pauson meticulously inspected the far side of the room as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inflexible . " The district attorney is calling , sir , " he announced . Curtis stood up . Miss Dalton had already retrieved her hand . She still sat on the floor , though , looking a little frightened . " I " she began , not looking at Pauson . " Have another glass of brandy ? " asked Curtis . Instantly she got to her feet , avoiding , it seemed to him , by sheer miracle the trailing chiffon . " No . No , I must go . " She sounded embarrassed . " I should n't have come . Really , I must go . " Like a small girl wearing her mother 's high-heeled slippers , she sped somewhat uncertainly across the room , passing Pauson as if he were a critical duenna . Curtis started to follow . Pauson still inspected the far wall . But then the front door closed with a soft bang . Curtis said brusquely : " I hope this has n't spoiled your evening , Pauson . I 'll take the D.A . ' s call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , sir , but I am guilty of a slight misrepresentation . The person on the wire is Miss Yates . " " Why the devil did n't you say so ? " barked Curtis , continuing toward the instrument . He reached it , raised the receiver and said : " Hello . " Susan 's voice sounded like fresh toast , warm and crisp . " That idiot , Leslie Carleton , " she said , " did n't produce his precious dog-heart buyer . Lost the dear fellow somehow . However , he fed me . I 've just escaped . Would you like to come over to the apartment for a drink with the girl who walked out on you ? " " No , " replied Mr Curtis , still rankling under Miss Dalton 's picture of the dinner tete-a-tete . " I 'm in bed and dead . " He was trying to visualize Susan wearing dozens of orchids . Anyway , for a description like that , she must have been wearing moreMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I19than one . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp over Carleton . Not , of course , that Miss Yates sounded in the least limp . On her way uptown from the phone booth in the Savoy Susan asked herself what on earth had been the matter with Lyle . He 'd sounded like two grizzly bears . Aloud , she asked herself what , also , was the matter with her ? These days she went around half the time feeling as if she were waiting for her own hearse . If Edith Dalton had slept badly the night before because Mr Curtis had failed to dine with her , Miss Yates slept even less satisfactorily that night . Her lovely face fought for a suitablespot on her pillow until dawn replaced the grim blackness outside her bedroom windows . CHAPTER EIGHTEENJUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS Susan had a peculiar reminder of thatdisquieting night on the boat deck of the SS Island of England . It consisted of a telegram received late one afternoon at her shop and signed " Mariner . " It must have cost rather a penny or two , she thought , for it appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatty way it began : Dear Susan You Must Remember Me Your Shadow Of The Boat Deck Who Did Not Act Then But Who Is Prepared To Act At Any Time If You Should Take It Into Your Head To Be An Interference In Any Plans Now Under Way Stop You May Not Fully UnderstandThe Importance Of This Warning But Just Watch Your Step Generally Stop Sometimes People Like You Talk Too Much Stop Sometimes They Try To Have Eyes In The Back Of Their Heads Stop Both These Habits Are Extremely Unhealthy For You And For A Certain Assistant D.A .

Susan put her hand on the buzzer to her secretary 's office . When Miss Button came in she asked : " When did this message arrive ? " Miss Button frowned . " I do n't know , Miss Yates . " " You do n't know ? " " It was rather queer . Ruby Holt found it on one of the couches in the salon just before we closed this afternoon . It was in the envelope sealed , so I do n't think anybody had picked it up and been trying to read it , but I thought it odd the messenger boy had just come in and dumped it down like that . " " Very , " said Susan thoughtfully . Then : " Miss Button , who exactly has been in the salon this afternoon ? " " Oh , quite a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peck , Mrs Stuyvesant , the Portculis sisters , that Miss Frost and Mrs Crier . Mrs Richmond watched the models for a while , after her fitting , and Miss Dalton came in just before Miss Mason left . We fitted that leopard and velvet jacket on her . I do n't think she more than passed through the salon though . There was an elderly lady in too . I do n't think we 've had her before . She wanted something for a funeral . Miss Holt took care of her . A Mrs Throggbottom , or something like that . She did n't find anything she liked . Very old lady and not stylish . " Miss Button paused , evidently trying to think if there had been any other clients . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I2ISusan asked : " Did we have any male callers ? " " Men ? " Miss Button laughed . " Well , not for fittings . Mr Carleton came in , you know , to say that that man in California  --  I mean , the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him  --  the ones he did n't buy when he was here . " Susan nodded . After a moment she said : " Ask Ruby and all the other salon girls to think back very carefully , to try to rememberif they saw anybody put down that telegram envelope . Anybody . Or anybody acting oddly . " Miss Button departed . In about ten minutes she was back , saying that not one of the girls could remember a thing . Ruby was the only one who had even seen the envelope , and she had only seen it when the salon had been emptied of clients after five o'clock . Miss Button asked if she should n't call Western Union and bawl them out for the messenger 's carelessness . Susan shook her head and pushed the blank across her desk . " I 'm afraid , " she remarked , " Western Union never saw this . " Miss Button scrutinized the message carefully . " Oh , Miss Yates , " she cried as she read to the first stop , " this is awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's just typed . It 's not from the telegraph-company machines . " Susan nodded again , her expression bleak . " It 's like being warned not to eat oysters when you never touch them , " she half moaned . " Button , I hate to admit it , but I 'm frightened . I have been for months . I 've wanted to tell Mr Curtis about that experienceI had on the boat deck of the Island , but he 's had so many official worries that I just have n't . Now I 'm afraid I 'll have to . I have n't the slightest idea what I 've been doing or saying that Mariner ' objects to ! " She flipped the telegraph blank toward her and read it once more . When she had finished Miss Button said : " Miss Yates , you 've got to tell Mr Curtis about it . Why , it 's awful . Quietly disappearingand quietly going mad . It 's fiendish . It must be a lunatic . You may be in terrible danger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to think , " Susan said , " what I could have said to the wrong person . " " Have you told anybody but me about that person watching you on the boat deck ? " Miss Yates puckered her brow . " Not at first I did n't . I did n't tell anyone on the ship . But yes  --  yes , about two weeks ago in a burst of confidence  --  and an attack of conscience for having even vaguely thought it might have been she  --  I told Miss Mason of my grim experience . " " Miss Mason ? " repeated Miss Button . " Did she react any special way ? " " Typically . Said it was too terribly exciting and why on earth had n't I told her before and that likely it was all my imagination . " Susan looked up at the serious face of the girl beside her . " And , to tell you the truth , until this "  --  and she flipped the blank again  --  " I had begun to think it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything I saw in Europe those last two weeks . But now " She left the sentenceunfinished . Miss Button took command . " Miss Yates , you 've got to call Mr Curtis right this minute . Right this minute . " Susan hesitated . " It 's like having periodic D.T.s , " she said . " Little green men from Brooklyn . I 've got those spidery fingers up and down the spine again . I tell you what , Button , my girl , it 's hell . " " It 's got to stop , " Miss Button said severely and proceeded herself to dial Lyle Curtis ' private number and to place the receiver firmly in her employer 's hand . Curtis ' end of the conversation was divided between scoldingSusan for having told him nothing of her boat-deck experiencebefore and commanding her to read the fake telegram slowly over the wire . He was obviously trying to reassure her and , at the same time , to instill in her the importance of caution . Susan smiled grimly . " Well , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FACE OF IT I23 " Exactly nothing , " snapped Curtis . " You are to go nowhere  --  nowhere , I say  --  alone . Take Ruby Holt , Miss Button or your maid with you every step you take until we 've run this thing down . Wait a minute . They 're not good enough  --  faithful as I 'm sure they are . I 'm going to send Withers up . You 've had him tailing you before as a guard . He does n't get in the way , but he 'll be there if needed . Do n't leave the salon this afternoonuntil he does get there . I 'm coming too . " Curtis rang off . Susan explained to Miss Button what the assistant district attorneyhad said and then glanced at her watch . It was a quarter to six . " Go on and get ready to leave , Button . You ca n't stay here all night . And nobody 's going to bomb the place , I imagine , or pick the front-door lock . " But Miss Button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant Withers arrived . However , she did agree to go to get her street things , saying she 'd be back in a second . Nothing at all happened until presently Curtis and his sergeantarrived . Susan left her shop with them . In Fifty-seventh Street there was no sign of an official car . Curtis explained : " I did n't want to advertise the fact that you 're being guarded . It might conceivably make somebody desperate . Withers and I are two gentlemen calling to take you to dinner . We walk at first . Act natural , my impetuous one . " Susan fell into step . As they turned east she noticed idly a long shining black car drawn up before the next shop . The uniformed chauffeur at the wheel was cupping his hands to light a cigarette in the breeze . She thought with equal idleness of Ruby Holt 's unceasing search for " the guy " who , she felt , had purposely pitched her on her face at the pier . All chauffeurs now came under Ruby 's closest scrutiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . Around the corner was an official car . Susan was bustled into it , and that night Sergeant Withers slept in the foyer of herI24 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITapartment ; at least , she told him to sleep . Curtis ' orders were less restful . But no untoward happening repaid the sergeant 's vigil . No other " telegrams " or messages of any sort followed the first . With Sergeant Jones in attendance in the daytime and SergeantWithers at night , Susan moved from duty to duty and social engagements to home . Nothing happened  --  nothing even seemed to happen  --  no episode with an even faintly eerie complexion . It was not comforting , however , to know that Lucinda , on her own statement , had told " simply everybody " she could think of about Susan 's queer experience on the ship . Simply everybody for Lucinda meant quite a crowd . It was not until after Christmas that anything else occurred even vaguely to be connected with the Island of England 's westward passage  --  save the post-shipboard parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air she breathed . But one day , between Christmas and New Year , Ruby Holt burst into Susan 's office just after the employees ' lunch hour . Her eyes were flashing , and there was about her a look of determined excitement . " Miss Yates , I saw him ! I know it was him ! " Susan was busy with some silk swatches . " He , Ruby , " she corrected automatically . Correcting Ruby 's eclectic grammar had grown to be an involuntary procedure . Usually Ruby was an eminently satisfactory Galatea . Today she was too excited . " But I did ! I 'm sure it was him . " " Suppose you make this devastating news clearer , " suggestedSusan , pushing aside the swatches . " The guy who threw me on my face . Only today he was n't wearing no chauffeur 's outfit . He was all dressed up in a checked suit and a tie loud enough to broadcast from the top of the Empire State Building and be heard in Thirty-fourth Street . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started disappearing fast . Tried to melt into the sidewalk he did . ButMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I25I 'd have caught him only Mr Carleton happened along and started sending you felicitations '  --  gee , he 's an elegant talker  --  and I had to answer him , and the guy got away . " Ruby was clearly bereaved . Susan suggested the possibility that it might not have been the same man and that she was glad an inelegant chase had not taken place . But Ruby remained insistent . She was sure it had been the same guy . He had been standing by a big black car , leaning against it , that was , smoking a cigarette , right in front of her eyes . But her approach had brought him instantly into action  --  the action of departure . Miss Yates pointed out that it would have been difficult to prove in any case that it was the same man , even more difficult to bring charges against him . He could certainly claim he had merely tripped over the dog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got loose . Ruby looked disgusted . " Aw , I was n't going to bring any charges , Miss Yates . I was going to tell him off . After what I was going to say he 'd think twice before he tripped up somebodyagain . " To quiet the girl Susan asked how Mr Carleton had been . Ruby at once abandoned her anger and became starry-eyed . " He was wonderful . Just wonderful . Gee , he dresses swell . Foreigners are just naturally refined , are n't they ? " Susan said she had never noticed it was inevitable and thought that for her own good Ruby was invariably just a little too ecstatic over Leslie Carleton . The child was really dreadfully impressionable . After Ruby 's excited appearance in her office Miss Yates went out for a late luncheon . It was twenty-five minutes of two when she reached Cristoph 's Restaurant . The first people she saw were Ethan Van Weck and Mrs Camilla Richmond in close conversation halfway across the room . Susan tried to glance away hastily , but Mrs Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF ITher unreal smile and called Susan to Ethan 's attention . He struggled to his feet , looking red . After about five minutes he wandered over to her table with the attitude of a dog sent to lie in a corner . " Susan , " he began , " h-how are you ? V-very nice day . " " Is it , Ethan ? I 've scarcely noticed . " It was difficult to avoid observing that Sergeant Jones had his eye on Ethan as if he were likely to poison her right there in the middle of Cristoph 's . Ethan coughed . " Ah , that is , er , n-not really exceptional . No matter . J-just mentioned it . Matter of fact , came over at Mrs Richmond 's request to remind you you are dining w-with her tonight . And by  --  yes , by the way , coincidences will h-happen . R-ran into Mrs Richmond here . It may be I was supposed to lunch with L-lucinda and forgot to t-tell her where . If you could , er  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lied Susan . " We poor souls must stand together . " Mr Van Weck blew his nose with less resounding emphasis than usual and actually beamed upon Miss Yates . " Exactly . Bad memories most unfortunate . Definite t-trial . W-will you join us for a cognac ? " Susan said " no " with thanks , explaining that she had just time for the hastiest of luncheons . When Ethan had gone back to his table she saw Sergeant Jones relax . However , since Mrs Richmond and Ethan were still chatting when she was ready to leave , Susan went around by their table to say that Mrs Richmond'sdinner gown would be ready for delivery in late afternoon , though it might be as late as six o'clock . Mrs Richmond made a half-irritable gesture . " But I sha n't dress before then surely , " and then added in a pleasanter tone , which she seemed to control with difficulty : " Do n't think I 'm cross . Life exasperates me today . Six or six-thirty will be in ample time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h-headache , " he assured Susan . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I27Moving away , Susan thought : " She looks more as if she were having a nervous fit . There 's a woman strung on wires if I ever saw one . " CHAPTER NINETEENBY THREE O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON Susan 's main salon wascrowded with women , smoking and watching the models parade by . As Susan entered the room she was struck  --  and not for the first time in recent months  --  by an unappraisable atmospherein this spacious and altogether-charming showroom . It was nothing she could touch , or smell , or see or hear . It was simply something she sensed . Probably simply the nerves from which she now chronically suffered . Perhaps the same kind of nerves from which Camilla Richmond suffered . It was disgusting . She had always been so darn healthy . But she and Mrs Richmond were n't the only ones these days . Half the women , it seemed to her , who came to the salon were jittery . They came to look at clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They filled the salon with smoke and small talk , but , increasingly in the past weeks , they had managed also to fill her with a new consignment of indefinable apprehensions . She stood watching the present scene and decided her older customers were not so changed . Her stolid , rich matrons still looked stolid and rich . But right now she would have sworn there were raw nerves at large in the room . Perhaps it was the war . The general unrest of the world . Many of her clientele came and looked at lovely clothes and went away with costume jewelry or trinkets for their dogs . Too many of her customers were doing just that . It was n't good for the profit side of her ledger . Yet she knew the bank accounts of most of her clientele were very excellently padded . New charge-account customers  --  of whom there had been quite an influx recently  --  were alsoI28 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITcarefully investigated . She had scarcely a client who was not definitely rich , but still there was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside one of her oldest customersand friends , a Mrs Sutton Corting . " Doris , " she whispered , " am I crazy , or is half the feminine population on the jittery side these days ? " Doris Corting drew on her cigarette , removed her eyes momentarilyfrom a white dinner dress on Ruby Holt 's willowy figure , flicked an ash into the aluminum bowl at her side and whispered back : " Well , Susan , I think I know what you mean . I feel the same thing  --  at my hairdresser 's and all over town lately . When I was buying shoes at Bortello 's the other morning nerves fairly rang in the air . Yesterday I dropped in at Mason Interiors  --  Lucinda Mason 's place  --  you know her , do n't you ? " Susan nodded . " The same thing there . I think it 's just the uncertaintyabout the European situation  --  politics here at hometaxes  --  everything . We go around shopping , and we go around shopping some more just to get away from our troubles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of her newer clients  --  a Mrs Crier who had " dropped in from the street " following her first Saint Simeon dog-heart advertisement . The woman had an extraordinary pallor , overly bright eyes and no repose . She was twitching about as she watched the clothes being paraded , her eyes alternately on them and on the entrance door . " I must be imagining things , " said Susan to Mrs Corting . " I have a feeling half the women in New York are expecting to see a ghost any moment . " Then she said something more cheerful and moved on . The woman with the overly bright eyes said to her as she passed : " Good afternoon , Miss Yates . Have you heard anything about the Island of England by any chance ? I mean , did she dock this morning ? " Susan had been expecting a shipment of gloves from London aboard the Island and had been in touch with the North HumMURDERON THE FACE OF IT I29bard Line that noon . The ship was reported four hours late due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked exquisitely distressed . She fumbled with her handbag and remarked irritably : " Oh dear . How rotten . That is , you see I 'm expecting friends for dinner who are arriving aboard her . " Susan murmured condolences and , after a moment 's further chat , again moved on . At that instant , through the entrance door , came Oscar II 's son on a leash and pulling Edith Dalton . Miss Dalton was wearing a ruffled and entirely inappropriate town coat which she had recently commanded Susan to design for her . It was queer , Susan thought , what deplorable taste Edith Dalton had . She had been in and out of the shop every day or so for weeks , ordering this and that , changing her mind about this and that , and not once had she made a suitable purchasein Susan 's opinion . The woman had a perfect mania for coats . She had n't yet let Susan do her a dress or a gown , but coats and trinkets she acquired with the abandon of a newly rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standstill just inside the salon . She looked as fluttery as her ruffled coat . Susan smiled and glanced down at Oscar II 's son . The cocker 's long ears were downcast . Lucifer , as Miss Dalton had chosen to name her pet , did not , Susan suspected , appreciate the atmosphere of smart fashion salons . He was an extremely engaging dog , however . Susan had been impressed by the way the little animal made friends . Clients were forever petting him . It had been Ruby Holt who had come to the kernel of the dog 's personal charm . Ruby had said several weeks ago : " Miss Dalton 's Lucifer 's been reading that book about how to make friends and lose enemies , I guess . " Now , glancing at Lucifer , Susan found herself annoyed , as she always seemed to be , one way or another , with Edith Dalton and her habits . Lucifer was n't wearing his Saint Simeon heart . He had n't been two days before when Edith had last visited the salon . Evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FACE OF ITof the ornament . It was annoying , because if women who got about a lot continued to " Simeonize " their canines  --  as Lyle called it  --  the fad and its profits might be indefinitely prolonged . And Edith had been helpful in publicizing the idea at first . She could be very helpful when she chose . She had introduced a number of customers to Susan Yates , Inc. , in the past months . Susan knew she should be giving her credit for that instead of criticizing her . It was surprising the wide connections the woman had . And immediately Susan found herself again being critical . The clients introduced by Miss Dalton , though wealthy enough , had not on the whole been big buyers . They were mostly the kind of women who dawdled about and ended by purchasing a lot of inexpensive costume jewelry . Besides , they no doubt come back again and again not because of prolongedimpulses of friendship on Edith 's part but because they liked Susan 's original and excellent merchandise . " Dammit , " muttered Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that female in heaven if we meet there . " She moved over to the door and , summoning a friendly smile , greeted Miss Dalton diplomatically . Edith exclaimed : " I 'm frantic . Simply frantic . Appointments all afternoon and not a thing to do this morning , and now that idiotic Island of England has to go and be over four hours late . " She announced her state of mind in something of a shriek . Several clients turned around and stared . " I mean , " she went on still semi-hysterically , " I was going to meet friends coming over from Paris , and I 'm half an hour late for the hairdresser 's now . Poor dears  --  all those days on submarine-infested waters . And that ship seems just fated to run into storms . Will you ever forgetthe frightful one we had , Susan ? " Susan shook her head . She was always a bit conscious of the fact that Miss Dalton had drifted into the Susan phase of address about the same time she had begun saying Lyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England came up to them . " Another storm , " she wailed . " As if warMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 131was n't enough . This is Thursday , and only Tuesday the Astoraniawas hours late . " She leaned over to pet Lucifer . Miss Dalton fluttered her hands . " It 's too , too dreadful weather . In my twenty years abroad I was led to believe New York had a much more angelic climate . " Mrs Crier straightened up and said : " Miss Dalton , it 's so stupid of me , but I 've come off with only cocktail money . Darling , could I send that bridge debt around to you somewhere tonight ? " Edith gurgled : " Dear Mrs Crier . How thoughtful of you to remember . But there 's absolutely no hurry , and , as a matter of fact , I 'll be out all evening . If it 's preying on your mind let 's say here at Miss Yates ' tomorrow morning . I 've got to come for a fitting , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her engagement book and came back in a moment to say Miss Dalton 's appointment was for ten o'clock in the morning . " Ten , yes . That 's right . Heaven knows I hope the Island is n't any later , or it will ruin my morning too . They might keep her in the bay all night or something . Well , I must run . " With that she turned on her ridiculous high heels and , hips swaying , disappeared . Mrs Crier murmured : " Such a dear girl ! " " Oh , very , " said Susan and turned her thoughts forcefully to the dress-designing business . It was Lucinda 's voice on the telephone an hour or so after Edith Dalton 's departure from the salon . " Camilla Richmond 's been here , " she announced , " wanting an extra man for her dinner tonight . I tried to reach you to see if you 'd get Lyle to bring one of his official playmates , but they told me you were officiating at a fitting , so I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person called Bob Thornton in his office and said he 'd drag him along . Know the Thornton ? " For a moment Susan could n't place the name , then Curtis ' 132 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITtelephone call from the Federal Bureau of Investigation man at her apartment the night of her return from Europe came back to her . " I 've heard Lyle speak of him , " she admitted . " Is Camilla Richmond having an extra woman or just balancing the sexes ? It was to have been another of our interminable **27;6361;TOOLONG , plus Lyle , was n't it ? " " One of those . What Ethan calls our European alliance . ' I do n't know what put an extra male into Camilla 's mind  --  or what she refers to as her mind . Anyway , I hope Lyle 's Bob Thornton is n't a droopy , fishy-eyed person . I feel like being gay tonight . What about meeting first at my shop for highballs ? Camilla 's cocktails are usually precisely what the name must once have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucinda laughed heartily , as was her custom over her own wit . " I 'll phone Edith Dalton to drop by here . Ethan 's coming back presently . The poor benighted soul is out now buying the charming Camilla a cup of tea . I 'll telephone Leslie . We 'll start the evening right . G'by . " Hanging up the receiver , Susan thought : " Poor Lucinda . So square-shouldered and sure of herself while Ethan lunches , teas and dines with the beautiful Camilla . " Then she wonderedwhy Mrs Richmond had n't asked her at Cristoph 's to get Lyle to bring an extra man . Glancing at her watch , she saw it was barely a minute past four . She left the phone and went into her workroom , where a sewing girl assured her that Mrs Richmond'sgown would be ready by six . Susan called Ruby Holt and explained that Mrs Richmond wanted to wear the gown that night . " I 'd take it along myself , except I have to go home to dress first and then drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it over to the Hotel Stixman ? " Ruby said she did n't have anything to do and sure she would , anything Miss Yates said . Susan thanked her and remarked that she had wanted to say something else but could n't recall what it was . It would come to her no doubt ; if not before she left she would telephone . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 133 " Keep a line open on the switchboard after Miss Button leaves , " she instructed the girl , and Ruby assured her she would . CHAPTER TWENTYCuRTIS ' OFFICE for the first time that week was filled with an atmosphere of relative quiet . Bob Thornton lolled in a deep leather armchair . Jack Copely , Curtis ' secretary , was taking dictation . The letter finished , Curtis said : " O.K. , Copely . Get yourself home for a decent night 's rest . Mr Thornton and I are going to a party  --  a Mrs Camilla Richmond 's , at the Hotel Stixman . You can file my whereabouts at the desk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Grinning , Copely made a note of where the boss would be , and Curtis , turning to Thornton , stretched extravagantly and said : " Nice work we 're in . " Thornton yawned , removed a leg from the chair arm and recommended a drink at the Stixman bar . " He probably thought , " Lucinda Mason was saying a trifle huffily , " that , being right in the same hotel with Camilla , it was too much trouble to come up to Fifty-seventh Street before dinner . " Edith Dalton observed sweetly that she only lived right across the street from his hotel and she had come . It was mean of Leslie . " But it only goes to show we should all move into the same place , " she went on amiably , " since we 're always palling around . You , I guess , prefer the Savoy , do n't you , Susan ? " The last she asked with an innocent smile . Susan stared . Whatever was the woman talking about ? Why should she prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact , " she said a little crossly. 134 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " And you , Edith , have been a great disappointment to me by not taking an apartment , " admonished Lucinda . Edith Dalton said : " Oh , darling , perhaps I shall yet . The winter 's young , and it 's only seven o'clock . Why do n't you ring up Leslie and tell him he simply must come over and have a drink ? " Lucinda put out a tentative hand toward the phone , but Ethan began to splutter . " You 1-left word , my d-dear , that you wanted him here at a quarter of seven . Hotels deliver such messages , one assumes . " For once Lucinda did not argue . She suggested another drink and rang for the shopmaid , whose usual duties of polishing antiques had been amplified this evening to include ice and soda dispensing . Lucinda said : " I would have asked Camilla to come over only I thought she might think it was pointed  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after tea , Ethan ? I mean , is she expecting us on time ? " Ethan blew his nose resoundingly . " How should I know what women expect ? " Miss Mason said : " Do n't lose your temper , pet , " and Edith Dalton , who had already disposed of her second highball , giggled . " Do you two talk that way in your sleep ? " she inquired , if indelicately . In the elevator at the Hotel Stixman Susan glanced at her watch . Intervening another volley of words between Lucinda and her husband , she remarked : " We 're late , but not terribly . It 's only twenty minutes to eight . " Ethan spoke with dignity . " I hope we shall not be asked to mix gin cocktails with your 0-olympian portions of scotch , L-lucinda . " Accompanied by Miss Mason 's scarcely dulcet retort , they emerged from the elevator at the sixth floor and reached MrsMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 135Richmond 's door . A maid , in the process of tying a kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Excuse me , " she said rather excitedly . " I thought it ' d be Mrs Richmond . " " Is n't she here ? " demanded Lucinda . The maid said no , that she 'd come first at six o'clock , maybe a bit early on account of housekeeper always hurrying them so , and there had n't been no answer . Her passkey had n't worked , and when anybody 's key did n't work it meant the night latch was on , so she 'd thought Mrs Richmond was sleeping and did n't want to be disturbed . She 'd gone back to housekeeper and asked her what to do . She 'd said to wait a while . Ethan , fidgeting , looked at his watch . " It is now seventeen minutes to eight , " he said , and it occurred to Susan afterward that he had spoken in a peculiar way  --  as if the fact were disturbinginstead of simply odd that their hostess was not at home . " We 'll take care of ourselves , " Susan told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . I 'll take the ladies ' wraps into the bedroom . " The maid 's eyes were wide , staring at their evening clothes . She gaped and said : " But it 's funny her not being here , because I was to come early to make appetizers and mix cocktails  --  only now I ca n't find the shaker . " " If there 's any scotch and soda in the place it would be more civilized , " remarked Ethan in a normal tone of restrained outrage . Lucinda said : " But where do you suppose she is ? " The maid , evidently fancying herself addressed , answered : " I do n't know , ma'am , I 'm sure . When I went back to housekeeper. she phoned the Madison Avenue doorman . He said Mrs Richmond had come in around half past five and gone right out again . So housekeeper told me to keep phoning here on account of maybe she might come in by some other door when she come back . " 136 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITEthan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdingit . He demanded : " There 's a coat closet , I p-presume ? " " Oh , yes sir , " said the girl , looking fussed but not moving . She had screwed her eyes into tight bows . " Only it seems funny , the passkey not working if she was n't in , if you see what I mean . " Ethan did not appear to , so she faced Lucinda as a superioraudience . " Sometimes I have second sight like , on account being born with a veil over my eyes . " Lucinda looked delightfully astonished . Edith Dalton shrieked : " What ? Oh , everybody , did you hear that ? Let 's have a seance . It might be much more stimulating than high-balls . " " R-ridiculous , " appraised Ethan . Watching the girl 's face , Susan asked soberly : " You mean you 've got a premonition or something ? " " Oh no , ma'am , I ai n't sick . Just uneasy as you might say . It ai n't comfortable in this here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Edith Dalton giggled , and Lucinda said : " Say that again . " " A presence , ma'am . Something you ca n't see . And the passkeyshould h'worked for me at six , for when housekeeper called the desk , a few minutes ago , lookin ' for the assistant manager finally to ask him what to do , he said it was crazy my key had n't worked , on account of the doorman was right : she had gone out ' bout half past five . " Ethan , looking like a statue draped as a practical joke , said with sharp dignity : " You told us that ! " " I know I did , sir , but desk said that at a quarter to six a bellhopused his passkey to let a girl in with a package . The door it worked all right then .

" " Well , housekeeper made me . But what I want to know is where is Mrs Richmond ? " Ethan spluttered . " No doubt a worthy ambition for k-knowledge , but ca n't we sit down ? Is it imperative to s-stand about t-this w-way ? " He thrust his coat and hat upon the maid , relievinghimself of the draped-statue look . " But , " thought Susan , " for all his irritability , Ethan seems somehow more worried than outraged . " Aloud she said : " Give me your wraps , girls . That was probably my Ruby Holt who came at a quarter to six with a package . I 'll just take your things into the bedroom and make certain she unpacked Camilla 's gown tidily . " Lucinda and Edith relinquished their wraps to her . The maid , finding herself capable of action , put Ethan 's coat and hat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Susan opened the bedroom door at the other side of the spacious drawing room she heard Ethan expostulating : " Do something about sitting down , L-lucinda , ca n't y-you ? " Inside the bedroom , Susan fumbled for a wall switch , found one near the door and gained a soft illumination of one end of the room from a tiny pink taffeta shaded bed light . The other end remained in darkness but at the foot of the bed she saw the rose-colored box from her shop . She crossed to the bed , putting down Lucinda 's and Edith 's evening coats . Then she slipped out of her own , saw scissors sparkling on the dressing table , went to get them and thought she must remember to tell the maid that the lost cocktail shaker was in the bedroom , for there it stood  --  a tall tubular one  --  in the middle of the dressing table . Returning to the bed , Susan thoughtfully snipped the blue hemp cord which bound the box and wondered why Ruby , who usually remembered things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perfectly folded , however , under layers of tissue was theI.3- ) q MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITwhite jersey dinner gown . Susan thought : " I 've never designed anything more exquisitely simple . It could be worn by a bride or by a corpse . " Finding this thought a little too grim , she turned an even less gay one over in her mind : " Shrouds For Important Funerals By Susan Yates , Inc . " Then she told herself to stop it ! For the love of heaven , think of something wholesome . Well , they did say she was the best designer in America . There ! That was better . Think of her fine professional reputation . Concentrate on being a modern career woman . Stop this insane nonsense of waiting mentally for a hearse to drive up any moment . She was as bad as the little hotel maid with her sepulchral talk of a presence on the premises . And , of course , it was all ridiculous ! Lifting the gown out of its tissue , Susan started across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric-light switch , and determined to think of something pleasant . Lyle Curtis would be there any moment . That produced a pleasantly exciting reaction on her cardiac system , pushed back the forebodings . Not finding another wall switch , she fumbled for the closet doorknob , found and grasped it , hoping there would be a light inside . The knob turned smoothly , and the door bounced open . Susan jumped back . Something heavily inert had fallen out of the closet against her knees , nearly knocking her over . It felt like a solidly packed duffel bag  --  logy and bulky . A little franticallynow she felt along the wall for the invisible switch which must be there somewhere . Then her trembling fingers finally found it and snapped it on . The room sprang into stark brightness from an overhead light . Susan 's eyes sought the floor . Breath caught in her throat . Her heart seemed to be descending on some internal elevator to the pit of her stomach . Up her spine started spidery fingers . Terror was sharp in her lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan from the floor was another pair of eyes . They bore the vacant gaze of death . Brown and cavernous theyMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 139were , and focused in their appalling stillness were her own fears of the past months . Mirrored in the astonished expression on the dead face was the clawing apprehension which had haunted her since the last of August . It was then , still shrieking , that Susan saw the curiously dainty weapon on the closet floor . It had evidently been dropped there first , the body shoved in afterward . Innocent looking it was . Clinical , at least . Clean-cut , of glass and steel . Designed to alleviatepain , and so very , very useful as a deadly weapon ! But , alone in a room , surely a murderer could n't just walk up to a victim and plunge a hypodermic needle into him without knocking him out first . Susan looked up and stopped screaming . She was no longer alone . The others  --  Lucinda , Edith , Ethan and the frightened little hotel maid  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were staring at the body and at her . Except for the maid , their expressions struck her as curiously guarded  --  sharply aware , - like those very careful faces at Mollasciap 's opening on the eve of the war . Looking down again at the body , it occurred to Susan that its expression was far from interested , as Alma Peters ' had been . It was gruesomely astonished . For no reason she could name Susan became suddenly convinced that the terrific concern people had shown to shake Europe from their heels in August was , in some incalculable way , responsible for Alma Peters ' death and also for the dead body at her feet . But that , she assuredherself , was another idiotic notion of pure instinct . Lucinda Mason was the first of the quartet at the door to utter a word . " My God , " she cried in a hoarse whisper . " Leslie Carleton ! " Afterward Susan went over and over in her mind the way the others had looked : how Lucinda had kept on repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to whimper shrilly ; and how Ethan had spluttered and stammered with complete inco-140 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITherence . The little hotel maid , had she been a Pekingese , would surely have lost her eyes . They bulged so they nearly dropped out . In each of the other faces Susan had seen  --  or fancied she had seen  --  the elaborately wary detachment of a sophisticated first-night audience . Lucinda , between her exclamations , had kept wetting her lips as if she were thirsty . Edith Dalton 's painted face had contained eyes that watched with bright excitement . Silly women , Susan had thought , often by their very silliness managed completely to conceal their real thoughts . But Ethan had looked wariest of all and suddenly very old , like an elderly gentleman-farmer dedicated to raising horses and grandchildrenand to the concealment of his passions . As the scene had expanded to a minute , which had seemed an hour , Susan had been impelled to scream once more . But she had stilled it in her throat , for suddenly she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no matter how Leslie Carleton had died  --  no matter whether it could be proved murder or suicide  --  not one of these friends of hers could be depended upon to prove her guiltless . Self-interest was too quick in their eyes . CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEA BELL WAS RINGING somewhere in Camilla Richmond 's apartment . Susan became conscious that the little hotel maid had disappeared from the group at the door . In another moment there were men 's voices from the direction of the foyer . Lyle Curtis ' voice and another . Susan cried : " Lyle ! Lyle ! Come here . Quickly ! " In a split second Curtis was at the door , looking over Lucinda'sshoulder as the maid had done . Behind him was a stranger , the F.B.I . man , Bob Thornton , presumably . Susan pointed , with what she supposed was pure idiocy , to the bodyMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 141at her feet . Her lips , she found , had a suspension quality she 'd never noticed before . They seemed to hang down and get wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the closet door ! " She sounded as if her tongue had a weight on it too . " I have n't touched anything but the electric-light switch , " she added lamely , as if she were trying to hide some awful guilt ; as if everyone were going to suspect her of having murdered Leslie Carleton . Curtis ' eyes looked up from the floor and held Susan 's for a long moment . They seemed to be saying to her : " Do n't talk . Do n't say anything now . " It was awful . It was as if he thought her guilty . She wanted to cry out : " But , Lyle , do n't you understand ? I only found him ! I do n't know anything about it ! " Curtis pushed between Lucinda and Ethan and started toward her , walking slowly and thoughtfully , as if he were trying to settle a number of things in his mind before he got near the body . As he passed her Edith Dalton clutched at his arm . Shrilly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm going to faint . " " Do n't , " recommended the assistant district attorney briefly . He came on toward Susan , on down the room , like a minister approaching an open grave . He stopped beside her , bent his head a little and scrutinized the still figure of the late Leslie Carleton . " No wound ? " he muttered flatly . Susan pointed toward the closet floor , and with his eyes he followed her gesture to the shining hypodermic syringe . Then he seemed to come to a sudden decision . He turned abruptly to the strange man at the door . " Bob , " he said , " take everyone into the drawingroom until I can get the straight of what Susan knows . I take it Susan found the body ? " His question was posed to Lucinda , Edith and Ethan by the direction of his look . With a sort of mass motion of exaggerated insistence they nodded their heads , and , with a courtliness which , under the circumstances , seemed crazily inappropriate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITusher them through the doorway . He he stopped to listen , eying Curtis . After a second Camilla Richmond 's strange voice came to them from the other end of the apartment : " I seem to have lost my key . Is everyone here ? " Susan supposedthe maid had answered the door . She was n't in sight . At the same moment Susan heard a whimper , indistinct but inescapable to a dog lover 's ears . She looked at Lyle and he looked at her . Evidently Bob Thornton had heard it too . He still stood with the door partly open looking back into the bedroom . Lyle dropped to his knees and followed the sound of a repeated whimper . It was coming from under the bed . He called : " Here , old fellow ! " There was silence for a moment ; then , cautiously , Oscar II 's other son  --  the one Leslie Carleton had bought from Lucinda  --  came out from under the bed . His ears were drooping , his head downca : t , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . Curtis intervened , picked up the animal and handed him to Thornton . At the same second Camilla Richmond 's softly guttural voice said from the foyer door : " Oh , did Leslie come after all , or did he send us his dog instead ? " Her tone was ironic . She stood , one gloved hand resting on the doorjamb , her eyes traveling from one to another of her guests . They were all standing , all staring at her . No one had spoken . Camilla 's eyes widened . She looked back at Thornton who was clutching the whimpering cocker spaniel . " Evidently , " she said sharply , " we are required to introduceourselves . I am Camilla Richmond . You are Mr Thornton ? " She stopped abruptly and began pulling off her gloves with hands that , even from the bedroom , Susan could see were shaking . Lucinda said hysterically : " Camilla ! Something horrible has happened . It 's  --  " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 143Like a cat pouncing , Curtis was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were n't you expecting Leslie Carleton here ? " Camilla Richmond 's eyes were still big , but Susan suddenly noticed they were not bright this evening . The note of irony per- sisting , she said : " Good evening , Mr Curtis . Do you mean something has happened to Leslie here ? " She took a step for- ward , then hesitated . " But I did n't expect him ! " Her voice rose resentfully . " That was why I was surprised to see his dog . I spoke this morning with him on the telephone . He said he could n't come . Did he come with you others ? " Mrs Richmond grasped the back of a chair and looked from face to face . As they stared at her her expression changed from irritation to utter dull-eyed weariness . " She looks ten years older than usual , " thought Susan . Then Curtis said with a curious sharpness : " He must have come , Mrs Richmond . He 's in here  --  in the bedroom  --  dead . " Camilla Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no other warning , fell on the floor in a dead faint . Susan , who went to her , was sure about that . There was no make-believe in the faint . With Lucinda assisting , splattering her canary-yellow gloves with water and being largely inefficient , they brought Mrs Richmond around in a few moments and got her onto the drawing-room couch . Meanwhile Susan was conscious that Curtis was talking on a telephone , that he was delivering crisp orders : " Medical examiner , " she heard . " Radio patrol , local precinct , detective district commander , District Attorney Scofield . Yes , routine with the department , but get through to Scofield , too , at once . " After a minute there was more muffled conversation  --  presumably with the district attorney himself . Bob Thornton , Susan saw , was keeping them all under the surveillance of his quiet eyes . She turned back to Camilla Richmond and asked her if she felt better . Remarkably dull eyes looked at her , then144 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITslowly canvassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into shreds . Presently she looked back at Susan and nodded , " Yess , better . " Then Curtis came away from the phone and motioned Susan to a far corner of the room . " That was a damn fool thing I nearly did , " he muttered . " The dog did us a good turn . It would have been a hell of a thing for these people to be able to claim afterward that I turned them out of the bedroom and stayed in there with you . They could say I was aiding and abetting you to conceal evidence of your own guilt . I was so damned excited seeing you standing over that body that I lost my head . Anyway , they ca n't say it now . " While he was speaking there was the whine of a radio-car siren outside in the street . It grew louder . A car squealed to a standstill below the windows . Then Susan began talking , rapidly , softly , telling him all she knew . It seemed only a matter of seconds before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ones arrived Curtis had time to ask : " There 's nothing  --  absolutely nothing more , Susan , than that you simply went into that room , opened first the box , then the closet door and Carleton 's body tumbled out ? " " That 's all . " " Why did you go in ? Just to take the coats and open the dress box ? " She nodded . " The little maid was so flustered . " " O.K. , " he said and turned to greet the forerunners of a New York police investigation  --  radio-patrol men . Immediately after them the precinct captain arrived and on his heels a squad of detectives from the precinct . Susan tried to guess which would be the detective district commander and the inspector in command of the division . A heavy-set man , whom she thought must be the detective district commander , spoke a few words to Curtis , then began spitting orders . It seemed to Susan hours  --  though she knew it was at most twenty minutes  --  before Dr Mordecai Dugan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected , accounted forMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 145his appearance instead of an assistant . Perhaps ten minutes beforeDugan put in his appearance an ambulance interne had crossed the drawing room , disappeared into the bedroom and announced in a singsong voice : " D.O.A. " " Dead on arrival , " Susan had muttered to herself , rememberingher first experience in the realm of crime . She shuddered but thought : " If it had n't been for the other case I should never , probably , have known Lyle . " The homicide squad was arriving , replete with stenographer and photographers . The latter went to work at once with black and white powder and battery fingerprint cameras . They glanced once or twice at the long gloves Lucinda still wore and at the pair which had fallen on the floor when Camilla Richmondhad fainted . Curtis was talking again to the heavy-set man . Bob Thornton had sat down but was still holding the cocker spaniel by the scruff of his neck . The dog wore no leash nor harness nor collar . Curtis seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal . Edith Dalton , who had kept miraculously quiet ever since Curtis ' terse recommendation that she not indulgein fainting , was sitting in a big chair , her hands folded calmly in her lap , but her eyes were bright as if she were intenselyenjoying all the excitement . " The woman 's callous enough to enjoy anybody else 's disaster , " Susan thought . She had n't even tried to help revive Camilla Richmond ; but then it had been obvious to Susan since their Atlantic crossing that no love was really lost between the two women . Why , Susan asked herself for perhaps the thousandth time , had they all kept alive such a ridiculous group ? It was almost as if each one of that little crowd from the ship 's table had been afraid somehow to lose track of the others . Or was she out of her head ? Oh , why go over it all again ? Lucinda had gone on with it because the other two women had been potential customersof her shop , because Carleton and Edith had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been really keen about Carleton . Susan herself ? Well , she 'd gone on because of the danger she 'd sensed in Edith Dalton 's gurgly charms much more than for commercial reasons . Might as well admit it ! Yes , not one of them  --  unless it was Lyle , the only " outsider "  --  had liked everybody else . Ethan and Camilla , in a curiously cloying fashion , had certainly joined forces . But she did n't believe Mrs Richmondcared the snap of a finger for any other of them . Queer , though , the way she had fainted when she learned Carleton was dead . Why should she faint any more than any of the rest of them ? If Lucinda had been less big-boned and sturdy it should have been her prerogative to faint , you would have thought . And why had Camilla Richmond 's hands trembled so you could see them do it across half of two rooms as she dragged her gloves off ? Ethan 's birdlike eyes were sharply wary . With the feeling of hysteria still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a somewhat elderly leading citizen faced with the problem of concealing a belatedly conceived offspring or some other result of secret passion . Though his eyes were missing no movement of the homicide men about the room , they kept returning to Camilla Richmond on the couch  --  covertly returning to her as if there were something connected with her which worried him . Lucinda , having with little technique assisted in reviving Camilla , had retired to a chair well removed from her husband 's . Her eyelids were half-lowered over her narrow green eyes , but from under them , Susan suspected , she was missing no detail of the activity of the homicide men . Although she still looked vaguely thirsty her expression otherwise was inscrutable . Susan had the feeling it was an expression borrowed from an impression of what an expression should be under the circumstances . If Lucinda had been alone with a stage director who had said : " No , better look this way ! " Susan felt certain Lucinda would have instantly changed it . And she wondered whetherMURDER ON THE FACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that she Ilad been in love with the man who was dead or something even grimmer . In any case , one could n't , before one 's husband , have hysterics over another man 's death . Suddenly the heavy-set man  --  the one Susan thought must be the detective district commander  --  spoke : " Attention , everybody . " Ethan and the women jumped as if a gun had gone off , and Susan 's heart pounded up momentarily from under the weight of caution . Curtis moved over to a table . The heavy-set man went up to it too . They both sat down . Ethan began twitching one foot up and down and , taking out a handkerchief , blew his nose resoundingly . The heavy-set man said : " Matter of record to attend to . Names and addresses . You first , please , Miss Yates . " CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOSUSAN FOUND HERSELF feeling queer , being singled out by name . Her voice , when she spoke , sounded to her miles away : " Susan Yates , Ten East Sixty-second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was staring with intensity at Camilla Richmond , who was still lying on the couch . Camilla had closed her eyes again . Tiny wisps of a handkerchief lay in fine shreds beside her . " Thank you , " boomed the heavy-set man to Susan . He looked next at Lucinda , erect , broad-shouldered , suddenly a picture of efficiency . Lucinda said : " In private life , Mrs Ethan Van Weck . That 's my husband over there . " And she pointed a canary-yellow gloved finger at the foot-twitching Ethan . " We live in Glen Cove , Long Island . My business name is Lucinda Mason . I 'm an interior decorator  --  558 Madison Avenue . " The stenographer was making swift symbols on his pad . TheI48 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITheavy-set man darted a quick glance around the room , then spoke in an undertone to one of the fingerprint men . The latter nodded . " Looks like nothing but smudges , " he said in a low voice . Then he went over to a table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things  --  some bond paper , or so it looked , and a jar of black powder . The heavy-set man faced them again and asked : " You , miss ? " looking at Edith Dalton . Miss Dalton smiled tremulously : " Oh , I 'm Edith Dalton . Miss Dalton . I 'm staying at the Hotel Eden right across the street . " Curtis was saying something softly to the stocky police officer who listened , then pinned his eyes once more on Miss Dalton and inquired : " American citizen ? " " Oh my , yes , " replied Miss Dalton . " My papa was Ferdinand Dalton . Everybody nearly in my family was born right here on the American continent . I guess Lyle  --  that is , Mr Curtis , " and she presented the assistant district attorney with a cupid's-bow smile of pretty apology , " evidently told you to ask me that be- cause I 've lived in Europe so long . Lots of people think I seem foreign . But I love the United States . I expect I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-set man waved away this flow of supposition and turned abruptly to Ethan . " You 're Van Weck ? Her husband ? " And he hunched a shoulder in Lucinda 's direction . " I am , " admitted Ethan without , for once , any elaboration . The interrogator scowled at nothing at all on the table , then looked across at Camilla Richmond whose eyes were still closed . " You able to talk now ? " he asked sharply . Camilla opened her eyes , and Susan saw that Dr Dugan , the medical examiner , was still staring at her . " la , " she muttered very gutturally , as if she felt too tired to remember English . " Ja , I can speak , although I fainted . " " What made you faint ? " the detective pounced at her with an even sharper tone . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 149 " Iss it customary in this country for persons to come to their residences and find someone dead ? " " Oh my , " thought Susan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You definitely should n't indulge in it , my girl . " The heavy-set man seemed to agree with Susan 's unspoken thought . His tone became immediately more disagreeable . " That the only reason ? " he demanded . " Iss it inadequate ? To me it was a shock . " " A shock , huh ? Did n't you meet him here in your apartment this evening and then go out afterwards ? " Mrs Richmond opened her eyes wider , but their usual brilliancewas still absent . She looked as if she did n't care what the man asked her or what she replied . " Nein . I did not do that . I did not know he was here . He said this morning he could not come . Would not . " " Would n't ? " " Yess . " " Why ? " " I do not know . " She stated it as if it made no difference whatever to her . The detective frowned and conferred again , behind a big hand , with Curtis . Then he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance into the suite of the party consisting of the Van Wecks , Miss Dalton and herself . Susan repeated everything exactly as she remembered it , including , of course , the fact that Mrs Richmond had not been there , the ultimate discovery of the dog and Mrs Richmond'slater surprise at seeing it , her question about whether Carleton had come after all or only sent his dog to substitute . Despite herself , Susan realized she was trying to make things easier for Camilla Richmond . It was inconceivable a murderer could care so little about what she said to the police . Camilla 's lethargy seemed almost like an illness , yet her nerves were obviously strung to a high key . Susan had the impression they were held in check by an involuntary balance wheel provided by the woman 's strangely inconsistent apathy . It was as if she150 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IThad two separate blood streams and a personality for each . Susan felt suddenly sorry for Camilla Richmond . A lot , she supposed , would depend on what the police proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had he been there  --  and alive  --  at about six o'clock when the staff maid had said she 'd found the door would n't open with a passkey ? If he had , then perhaps Camilla could clear herself by the hotel clerk 's statement that she had gone out at about half past five . But who would be her witness that Carleton had been alive at six o'clock ? Medical examiners , she remembered , never made too definite statements about the time of a death . Susan looked again at Camilla Richmond . Why was n't she more on the alert ? Why was she engaging in indolent irony instead of thinking of the danger involved in having a man found dead in her apartment ? The heavy-set man was talking again but ignoring Camilla Richmond . He was asking for names and addresses from the little maid , who was again fussing with her apron strings , and from a woman who had just come in and who said she was the hotel 's housekeeper , able to vouch for the maid 's story . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd , " I ca n't say for sure she could n't get the door open with her passkey . I only know she said she could n't . Of course if the door was locked on the inside she could n't . " One of the homicide squad was bringing in three boys in elevator-operator uniforms . The heavy-set man snapped : " Which of you is on service ? " A lad with freckles stepped forward a quarter of an inch on painfully polished shoes . " I am , sir . " " Did you bring this girl "  --  and the questioner indicated the maid  --  " up here about six o'clock tonight ? " " Yes sir . Two minutes before six . I 'd just come on duty and was early . I noticed because it 's better to be early than late . " And he smirked , displaying a toothless space in the exact center of his mouth . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 151 " How long did she stay  --  since you 're so accurate about time ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She did n't stay . I did n't have no other call just then , so I waited . She knocked on this suite 's door and tried her passkey . She rang a couple of times , then she come back to my car . She says to me : Pat , my lady ai n't in yet . I thought she told me t'be here at six . Musta said seven . ' So I took her back down , and she did n't come back up until twenty-two minutes to eight . I looked at the hall clock out there when I let her out , and I says , Say , you 've had a good rest  --  ' " " Never mind what you said , " admonished the heavy-set man , turning to the other elevator boys . " Which one of you brought up a redheaded girl with a box some time before six o'clock ? " " I did , sir . " It was the taller of the two boys who spoke . " Know what time it was ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me the time . Said she hoped she was n't late , that she had a dress to deliver for a lady to wear tonight . I put my head around the door of the car and asked Eddie who was standing there to check with the lobby clock for her . It was just fifteen to six . Then I asked her what floor , and she said she was going to Mrs Richmond 's suite , sixth floor . I called to Eddie and told him to get a desk key and come up with us to let her in on account of Mrs Richmond being out . Y'see , I 'd taken Mrs Richmond down  --  right after she come in with that gentleman " With complete unexpectedness theboy turned and pointed to Ethan 's fidgety figure . " What 's that ? " boomed the detective , and Susan caught a new look of attention in Curtis ' eyes . Ethan looked fittingly outraged . " I said I told that redhead that Mrs Richmond was n't in , that I 'd get a bellboy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I know . But what about Mrs Richmond having come in with that man over there ? " The heavy-set man nailed the air152 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITin Ethan 's direction with a fat finger . Ethan began to splutter incoherently . The elevator boy looked from the incensed Mr Van Weck to the heavy-set man , hesitated a second , then said resolutely : " Well , she did come in with that gentleman  --  about ten minutes before the girl with the box showed up . They came up here to the sixth floor . She got out first . When he started to follow , she turned around and said something about being sorry not to ask him in . He seemed a little surprised , " added the boy naively . At this Lucinda from the other side of the room sniffed audibly , and Ethan , who was now sitting on the edge of his chair , stammered in Lucinda 's general direction : " I c-could h-have s-seemed no s-such thing . I never am s-surprised at anythinga m-member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffed and , taking from his breast pocket a fine linen handkerchief , blew his nose as if it had been a bugle . Curtis and the man beside him watched this performance with flattering attention . The latter now said to the elevator boy : " You say Mrs Richmond came down again right away ? How soon ? " " Oh , I 'd no sooner got down to the lobby with that gentleman than Sixth Floor rang . I went right back up , and Mrs Richmond was standing there , just like she had n't moved . She said : I must go out again . ' So I brought her down . " The boy stirred uneasily under the attention his words were gaining . The heavy-set man looked at a wiry little man near the door . The latter Susan had noticed alternately listening to what was being said and spitting orders to invisible persons in the hall . To do this he ducked his head in and out of the doorway in a fashion which had been fascinating her . " Check that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out , " commanded the detective . The wiry man said : " It 's been checked . O.K. " " Where ' d you go ? " demanded the heavy-set man , turningMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 153toward the couch . " Why 'd you come in and go right out again ? Did you go into your suite ? " " Which , " inquired Camilla Richmond in a far-off voice , " shall I answer first ? Never mind "  --  and she waved one hand irrital ) ly  --  " Ican remember . I did not go into my suite . I came up to this floor just to get rid of Mr Van Weck because I had an appointment to keep . " Ethan , Susan saw , looked utterly astonished at this , and she suspected the sound emanating from Lucinda 's direction of being an unpleasant chuckle . " Appointment with who ? " the heavy-set man was booming ungrammatically . " An appointment to meet someone with a package at the Forty-ninth Street door of the Nottinghope Hotel around the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding now like someone dictating a dull business letter . " A package ? What was supposed to be in it ? " Susan saw the wiry man 's head pop out the doorway at his chief 's words . Mrs Richmond hesitated , opened her mouth , closed it and unexpectedly shut her eyes . She said , between tight lips and with her eyes still closed : " A present . Someone called me and suggestedI go to the Nottinghope at twenty before six this eveningto wait for it . " " Why do n't you have your presents sent here to your own hotel ? " " Thiss  --  thiss wass different , " said Camilla , sounding even more dully Germanic . The detective 's tone was disagreeably incredulous . " Guess it must have been . Not such a good story , sister . Gus , have that checked with the Nottinghope doorman . It 's only a step from here . Wait a minute , " he called to the wiry little man who paused like a rooster , head raised to crow into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How long do you say you stayed over at the Nottinghope ? " 154 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITCamilla 's eyes were still closed . She was pulling at a couch pillow with her long nails . Suddenly she sat up as if she were a puppet pulled by invisible strings . She said loudly : " From twenty minutes before six until twenty minutes before eight ! And no one came ! " Her tone was one of unexpectedly violent accusation . Everyone stared at her . Susan saw Dr Dugan moving over to the heavy-set man . He leaned down and said something behind a hand . The detective listened , looked surprised , then nodded and , glaring back at Mrs Richmond , demanded : " You were waiting for dope , eh  --  cocaine ? " Camilla Richmond was on her feet in one tigerish spring . " Yess ! " she almost shrieked . " And if I wass , iss it your business ? " She stood swaying uncertainly . Dr Dugan said something else softly to the detective , then walked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner pointed out , " you need a dose . It 's obvious . We 'll give it to you if you tell us the whole truth about this business . " Her eyes narrowing cautiously , Camilla demanded : " Are you a doctor ? " " Yes , I 'm the medical examiner of the city of New York . We 'll give you a sufficient dosage to relieve your present tension if you come clean about what happened in this apartment to-night . " The laugh which filled the suite was singularly beautiful in tone , but Camilla Richmond 's eyes were shockingly greedy . She put shaking hands on Dr Dugan 's arm and began to speak in short , rapid sentences . " Talk ? Yess , I 'll talk . I found Leslie here . He was schmahlich . He taunted me . He refused to give me the cocaine he had promised . Schwein ! When he did not I killed him . Then I went back to the Nottinghope . " " Where you hoped there was another chance of getting some ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to him with angry eyes that smoldered like half-dead coals . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 155 " Yess . Yess . Natiirlich . " " And , " Curtis went on softly , " you did all this and dumped the body in the closet while the elevator boy was taking Ethan Van Weck down to the lobby and coming straight back for you ? " " You think I lie ? " " Did you ? " he persisted pleasantly . " Yess . Just as , I say . " " But there really was n't time . " Camilla hesitated . A long moment hung in the air . " All right , " she muttered slowly , " you are right . I came back later . " Abruptly she turned to Dr Dugan with a hungry expression . " Yess , I came later . " Curtis shot a glance at the day elevator boys . " Which one of you brought her up again after she went down around fivethirtyor five thirty-five ? " The boys shook their heads blankly . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What elevator did you use ? " Her eyes still cautious , Camilla said slowly : " Service . " Then , brightening , she pointed to the night-service operator . " He brought me up ! " The night boy stared at her , then twisted his head around to the men at the table . " No , I did n't . I never had that lady in my car . " With her former negligence Camilla remarked : " Then it was the other one . They have more than one service boy . What does it matter ? I have confessed . I have not objected to saying I killed Leslie Carleton . " Curtis ' voice was even softer . He asked one word : " How ? " The masquelike face hardened . She turned on him as if he were a mosquito which kept coming back at her . She stood very quietly . Only her hands , clutching at Dr Dugan 's arm , moved . Suddenly she laughed again , a shockingly hopeful rippleof laughter . " But of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iss it because I156 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITneed a dose that I am so slow to comprehend ? I killed him with the cocaine he had brought me but would not give me . Eh , did I not ? " The question was posed to Dr Dugan with a turn of her head . He nodded . " Apparently you did . A whacking big dose . You could have saved some for yourself . Half as much would have done the trick with the deceased . How 'd you get it away from him ? What did you hit him with first ? " Camilla shrugged . " I have said enough . I will tell no more . " " Well , there you are , D.D.C. , " the medical examiner said disgustedlyto the heavy-set man . " Glad to be of service . " He laughed sourly , firmly removed Camilla Richmond 's hands from his arm and stalked off across the room . Susan was saying to herself : " So the heavy-set man is the detective district commander ! " It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool confession . Camilla stood by the couch , her arms limp at her sides . All color had drained from her face . It looked like parchment . She watched the retreating figure of Dr Dugan until he reached the door ; then she cried : " I think you do not dare to do this trick before all these witnesses . You made me a promise . " Dugan turned . " You 're going to get an adequate prescription to keep you from cracking , but we do n't run a hop house downtown . Bring her along , boys . I 'm going with you . " Two men on the outer fringe of the room 's officialdom came up and took her arms . Camilla went docilely enough . For a few seconds there was that complete silence which sometimes follows the falling curtain of a play . It was quickly replaced by sounds of renewed official activity . The homicide men looked at their chief and began to move around the room , packing up their little world of scientific equipment . The D.D.C . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day-service elevator kid . Yeah , bring him in here . This is a comfortablespot . " He stretched approvingly in the chair behind the table and remarked to Curtis : " Of course there ' re still details . MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 157He was n't a dwarf  --  that Carleton . She must have had somethingof a struggle to get the dope away from him . Probably hit him with that tubular cocktail shaker that 's in the bedroom . It 's been wiped clean of prints , the boys tell me . But she 'll come through with the rest of the story in good time . " He turned in good humor to the stenographer . Curtis said to a fingerprint man : " Any luck ? " " Nothing but smudges all over the place  --  except the corpse 's . Got ten beauties of his on the closet floor where she 'd propped him . Found the hypo in there too . " Curtis nodded . The other went on : " This Richmond dame wore gloves evidently . Sometimes I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones being such a rarity . A guy purposely smudges or innocently leans too heavy . Either way , no good to us , are they ? " Curtis was looking serious . He shook his head , turned to the D.D.C . and said something . The other looked doubtful , then annoyed , as if life were suddenly a pain in the neck . Obviously agreeing remorsefully with whatever Curtis wanted , he boomed : " Moment , all of you . There are a few more questions . Mr Curtis has something to ask you . " Curtis said : " The district attorney 's office would like to have evidence to make it a little clearer when the deceased  --  Mr Leslie Carleton  --  came here to Mrs Richmond 's apartment . The medicalexaminer says he 'd been dead at least two hours at eight o'clock . Can any of you elevator boys help on when he got here ? " The three boys as a group shook their heads . The two guest elevator operators had been on duty since one o'clock that afternoon , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man and a woman , unknown to the operator , about half-past four . He had taken all three of them up to the seventeenth floor where Carleton 's own suite was , and he rememberedtaking the guests down again around five o'clock . He had n't seen Carleton after taking him up. 158 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITCurtis nodded and said to the D.D.C. : " Get your boys to locate Ruby Holt and bring her in . " Susan started . " Why on earth , " she thought , " does he want Ruby when Camilla has confessed ? " In the back of her mind there began to hammer a nagging point of fact . Ruby , had had a crush on Carleton , and she had been in the Richmond apartment at a quarter to six . At eight o'clock the man had been dead at least two hours . Well , perhaps he had been dead and in the closet when Ruby was in the suite . And Camilla Richmond had confessed . CHAPTER TWENTY-THREECURTIS WAS SAYING : " Let 's have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . Which bellhop was it ? " he asked , turning to the elevator boy who had described Miss Holt 's arrival . The operator said : " It was Eddie , " and in a few moments Eddie was produced  --  another wide-mouthed , frank-looking youngster in a bellboy 's uniform . Yes , he had come up with the redhead to the sixth floor . He 'd unlocked the suite door and gone in with her . She 'd only stayed just long enough to put the box she had on the bed and to speak to the gentleman from the seventeenth floor . " To what ? " bellowed the detective district commander , and Curtis spat out : " Say that over . " The bellhop stared . " Why , she stopped to speak to Mr Carletonwho lives up on the seventeenth floor in the hotel here , " he repeated , mystified . The elevator boys in their corner of the room snickered , apparently feeling superior because of their knowledge of Carleton 's present status . Misinterpreting this interruption , the bellhop stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF IT 159 " Do you mean , " asked Curtis , " that Mr Carleton was here in Mrs Richmond 's suite ? " With less self-assurance the bellboy nodded . " Yes sir . He was sitting there by the table reading a magazine . He just looked up when we came in and said to the girl : Hello ! You bringing over something from Miss Yates ' place ? ' then went on reading . The redhead said yes , she was . I guess she wanted to talk , but he did n't , so I and her went on into the bedroom . She put the box down on the bed and came back out with me . Only thing was , I thought it was sort of funny Mr Carleton being here on account of Mrs Richmond was out . But then people with suites can do as they please , " he added , with the air of one stating that the earth lies below the heavens . " Thank you , " said Curtis evenly . " Remember what time you took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby ? " " Why , yes sir , we went right back down , and it was just past a quarter to six when we went up . The girl asked me and Loggy over there "  --  and he indicated the taller of the guest elevator boys  --  " what time it was before we went up . It was fifteen to . We was n't up here over a minute or two . " From his corner the elevator boy called Loggy said : " I told ' em all that , Eddie . " Eddie 's expression became an ardent question mark . Curtis thought a minute . " You 're sure , then , " he asked , " that was all Mr Carleton said ? He did n't inquire where Mrs Richmondwas or anything else ? " The boy puckered his brow . " No sir , he just said what I told you . " I see . Thank you very much . You can go now . " Showing obvious envy of the elevator boys , the bellhop started to leave . Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly Curtis called out : " Here , son , just a minute , " and the boy turned eagerly . " Did you see Mr Carleton 's dog running around when you were up here ? " 160 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " Sure , it was here . " He cast an eye in the direction of Thorntonand the still-captive cocker . " See anything different about the dog now ? " queried the assistant district attorney . " Different , sir ? " He scrutinized Oscar II 's son . " It looks about the same . Oh  --  except that the harness was on it and the leash was dragging on the floor . The girl nearly tripped over it . " " Nothing else ? " pursued Curtis in a noncommittal tone . " No sir . It looks maybe a little scared now . " " So it does , " Curtis observed , and said to Thornton : " Let 's do something about him . Poor fellow . " Lucinda spoke up . " I wondered how long he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can sit in my lap if the police have no serious objections . " The D.D.C . looked owlish . Curtis nodded to Thornton , and Lucinda , tossing her broad shoulders with a gesture tending to indicate more than her words a disdain for whether the police cared or not , called to Oscar II 's son as Thornton released him . The animal went to her and jumped with a cringing air into her lap , where it sat shivering . " Somebody 's mistreated this dog , " observed Miss Mason and cast a jaundiced eye in Thornton 's direction . " That , " said Curtis , " may possibly have some bearing on the case . You better take it with you tonight . " Miss Mason muttered something that sounded like : " I intended to without instructions from anybody . " But no one paid any attention . At that moment the wiry little man brought his head in the doorway and said to the D.D.C. : " Sorry , chief . We had to pick up the Hotel Nottinghope doorman at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's description was standing there all right for nearly two hours , according to his guess .

She made a few trips in and out of the lobby , butMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 161his impression is she was n't out of sight for more than a few moments at a time . " The D.D.C . grunted , but Curtis looked disturbed . He glanced at Susan and seemed to make up his mind about something . Once more there was a whispered consultation behind hands at the interrogation table . Then the D.D.C . ' s voice boomed : " As a matter of form we want to establish alibis for all you folks . Miss Yates , where were you between five o'clock this afternoon and the time you arrived here at the Stixman Hotel ? " Susan tried not to show her surprise . She said quickly : " I was at my shop  --  in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I drove to my apartment and dressed for the evening . I arrived at Miss Mason 's studio at about a quarter to seven , I think . We had some highballs and got over here at exactly twenty minutes before eight . " Ethan 's voice suddenly intruded . " T-that 's entirely c-correct . I looked at Miss Yates ' watch when she called attention to the time , and then I looked at my own . Seven-forty was right . " " Why ? " demanded the D.D.C. , returning to his disagreeable tone . " Why did you look at your watch ? " Ethan displayed disapproval of both tone and question , and Susan thought : " He always stammers worse when he 's out-raged . " " W-w-why ? " inquired Mr Van Weck irately . " W-w-why n-not ? H-have n't I the right to c-confirm the time when I w-wish to ? Do n't tell me such an action h-has become illegal ? " The D.D.C . looked as if he wanted to say : " Ah , nuts ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elevator boys : " Which of you brought this crowd up ? " The one who had remembered Ruby indicated that it was he . He also remembered the conversation about the time . " O.K. , " spat out the detective , still addressing the boys . " Now about that redhead , did she seem flustered or anything when she left ? " " No sir , not exactly . " 162 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " What do you mean by that ? " " Well , she was giggling , I 'd guess you 'd say . " " Giggling . My God , I said flustered . " He eyed the boy , however , with fresh interest . " You do n't mean giggling as if she was hysterical or something , do you ? " The other elevator boy tittered , and the one under questioninglooked both bothered and unhappy . " Well , I did n't mean nothing , sir . " " Did n't mean nothing . What do you mean by that ? Answer my question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make anybody hysterical just to have a guy ask her did she have a date this evening  --  " The D.D.C . made a rumbling sound clearly indicative of profounddisgust , but before a withering eye could be turned to him the other elevator boy chirped : " And she did ! She must have . She was in such a big hurry . When she got to the Madison Avenue door she started running like somebody was trying to catch her . " Not even the detective district commander seemed to miss the fact that this statement was made largely to embarrassthe operator who had inquired into Miss Holt 's plans for the evening . Interrupting this diversion , the wiry man popped his head once more into the room . " Mike 's brought in the day-service elevator kid . " His announcement was followed by a sleepylookingboy in street clothes who eyed the gathering with astonishmentand his Hotel Stixman co-workers with suspicion . Curtis spoke to him reassuringly . " Tell us , son , did you run a hotel guest named Mr Leslie Carleton down in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " The boy 's eyes were alert now . He hesitated only a moment , then said : " Sure . Just before I went off duty . Sometime between five-thirty and six anyway . " " You did n't , " popped up the night-service elevator boy , " do it after five fifty-eight because I took over then . You know I did , ahead of time . " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 163The newcomer regarded his contemporary with a somewhat bellicose expression . " Sure I know it . Anyway it was earlier than that that Mr Carleton came down and got off here at the sixth floor . I know because " " Because what ? " The D.D.C . shoved in his question , interruptingone from Curtis . " Do I have to say ? " asked the boy , his eyes on Curtis , who nodded . " Well , because he give me a dollar to forget it . " The heavy-set man looked pleased , but Curtis leaned over and said something to him which changed his expression to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agreed , with an appearance of regretting the necessity of humoring the district attorney 's office . He shrugged fatly and turned to the day-service elevator operatoragain : " You know the guest that lives in this suite  --  a Mrs Camilla Richmond ? " " No sir . " The boy was emphatic . " Did you take a lady up in your elevator between five-thirty and the time you went off duty this afternoon ? " Without warning the boy became suddenly , alertly tongue-tied . He began shifting from foot to foot , looking extremely guilty . " Did you ? " repeated the D.D.C . in a bellow . " Y-yes sir , I guess I did . " " When ? " " About fifteen to six . " " Why do n't you want to talk ? " " It 's this way , see , she 's a real lady and terrible sad . " " What 's that ? What ' re you keeping back ? " The D.D.C . had gotten very red in the face . The elevator operator 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " instructed the heavy-set man . " I ai n't talking about her . " " Do n't want to kill a goose that lays gold eggs , huh ? " " No sir , it ai n't her tips . She 's nice . And often when she comes down she 's crying . Behind her veil . But I can see she 's crying . She 's in love , sir . " a64 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " My God . " The D.D.C . sounded as if that was the last straw in an exasperating day . " Who is she ? " " I do n't know her name . Honest , I do n't . " " But you know where she goes . You know she comes back to this floor  --  the sixth  --  or maybe you used to take her to the seventeenth floor , eh ? Maybe it was n't the tenth ? " The boy was still looking stubborn , but he also now looked guileless , Susan thought . " Tenth floor , " he repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved . " I do n't know . I ai n't interested in no blackmail . " " You think she meets a man ? " " I guess she 's in love . Awful in love . " " Describe her . What 's she look like ? " " She 's quiet . She ai n't no common sort . " " How does she dress ? Always the same ? " asked Curtis unostentatiously . The boy hesitated , then , reassured by Curtis ' encouraging expression , said : " She always wears a black veil , sir . " " She always wears a veil , " repeated the assistant D.A . The boy nodded . " How often does she come here ? " " About once a week . Sometimes twice . " " You know she 's the Richmond dame , " the D.D.C . roared . But the boy was adamant . He insisted he did not know theveiled visitor 's name and did not know the name or appearanceof anyone named Mrs Camilla Richmond . The D.D.C . turned to Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Making these tenth-floor trips . Smart ! " But Curtis was looking rather bleak . He gazed thoughtfully at the boy and asked him : " What time did you take this lady back down to the street tonight ? " " I did n't , sir , " said the day-service operator . " She did n't go down again while I was on . " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 165 " You took her then , " bellowed the D.D.C. , pinning his eyes on the night-service operator . This one was more jaunty . " I ai n't yet , " he said . " I have n't taken down no ladies . just hotel workers  --  staff . " From the obscurity of a corner to which she had retired the hotel housekeeper spoke up unexpectedly : " Mind your tongue , me lad . Some folks as works could be ladies too . We got " " Shut up , " instructed the D.D.C . somewhat inelegantly . The housekeeper bristled and muttered : " Well , we 've got a duchess working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at Curtis , and Curtis was nodding his head and murmuring just loud enough for Susan to hear : " A bit ticklish sending the boy up to look over all clandestine possibilities on the whole tenth floor . . . " His voice dwindled , and there was a brief delay while they spoke inaudibly and while the wiry little man from the door was called to the table and given low-voiced instructions . He left the room then but was back again almost at once , towing a sprucely dressed personage who lost no time in explaining that he was the hotel manager and that he had been pacing  --  " simply pacing "  --  the corridor outside , waiting to be called in . " Too dreadful . Too horrible . Poor Mr Carleton . So bad for the hotel . " Bluntly the D.D.C . asked what the layout was on the tenth floor . The hotel manager looked even more upset but assured him the tenth was the top-rate floor  --  " all suites . " He began making washing motions with his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch what they went on saying , but the voices were too low for her to hear more than odd words , most of them Curtis ' : " If you do it . . . maintaining Stixman tradition . . . take operator . . . lady wearing . . . explainthere ' 11 be no trouble . . . if . . . actually visiting . . . entire tenth floor . " The hotel man made more washing motions but apparently166 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITfinally agreed , for he went off , looking haughtily miserable , taking the day-service elevator operator with him . The D.D.C . turned to Susan after a moment 's low-voiced conversation with Curtis . " Anybody to confirm the time you reached your apartment , Miss Yates ? " He spoke politely , but before Susan could answer the wiry man at the hall door , whose head at the moment was inside the drawing room , announced : " Confirmed , chief . Reached her apartment at five-thirty . Doormanand elevator man agree . Her maid says she came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried on , seeing the D.D.C . scowl : " Doorman not certain when she left again , but it was after six-thirty , because the night operator remembers bringing her down . " Susan thought it was an experience to hear oneself described in so objective a fashion , but she smiled over what had evidently been the tenor of her Lillian 's reply . Lillian had been her nursemaid , then her mother 's lady 's maid , and now she was Susan 's duenna , mentor , cook and all-purpose . She was worth her weight in gold . Returning her attention to the room , she found the D.D.C . was booming again , saying to the wiry little man : " In the future , Gus , step over here to the table with your reports . Anybody ' d think you was broadcastin ' . " Then Lucinda was asked to describe her movements between five o'clock and the arrival of her husband , Miss Yates and Miss Dalton at her studio . Lucinda was looking sulky . She hugged the shivering cocker spaniel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child : " I was at my place of business straight through the afternoon . I 'm not in the habit of running all over town  --  except to see clients . And clients came to see me this afternoon . I dressed at the studio too . My husband will doubtless recall that I was there when he showed up at twenty minutes to seven  --  not yet dressed ; I mean he was n't yet dressed . He had to rush like the devil , for Susan and Edith were there before seven . " MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT I67Edith Dalton put in : " Oh , loads before . Do n't you remember , Lucinda , we 'd already had a drink and were wondering where poor darling Leslie was when one of us said : But it 's only seven , ' and I suggested : Why do n't you ring him up at his hotel and tell him he 's simply got to come over for at least one drink ? ' And besides , " she persisted , turning her head toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Curtis , " besides , I 'm certain Miss Mason was right at her shop , because she telephoned me from there at about six o'clock . " The D.D.C . looked deeply shocked at such unruly logic . " How do you know where she was calling from ? " he demanded . " Oh , but I 'm sure she was at her studio , " insisted Miss Dalton . " She said she was . Why on earth should she if she was n't ? It would be so silly . You did say so , did n't you , Lucinda ? " Lucinda nodded sulkily . " I did because I was , " she stated tartly . CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURNine o'clock in the evening . LUCINDA MASON continued to look sulky following her interrogationand the decidedly loose establishment of an alibi . Curtis had been watching Lucinda closely , but now he seemed to be studying the exact tip of Susan 's minutely upturned nose . As Edith Dalton burst into speech once more he turned his eyes to her pretty fluttering motions , and Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluble person . Instead she dragged out her powder compact and lipstick , disgustedly inspectingthat portion of her face upon which Curtis ' eyes had seemed to be fastened . Her reflection made her feel at least eighty years old . Her nose was shining , and her lipstick was askew . Looking up over the mirror at Edith again , she thought that some women had too much luck . Miss Dalton 's nose wasn't168 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITshining a bit . There was but faint satisfaction in the fact that her cupid bows were rather ragged , because their disarray merely gave Edith the look of an unfinished portrait . With another glance at the milky skin and its exaggeratedly rouged cheekbonesSusan decided Edith Dalton was a fool . She would look a million times better without such silly lips . Her natural ones were n't bad at all . Most women would thank their stars for them . Apparently entirely unaware of this critical examination , Miss Dalton was still prettily fluttering words and hands . Susan thought irritably that surely an idiot who went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith was expressing herself as simply too thrilled by being present at a murder investigation . Also , in a rambling way , she was establishing a decent-enough alibi for her own whereabouts between five o'clock and her arrival at Miss Mason 's . " I was at Miss Yates ' about three-thirty , and then I went to the hairdresser 's . I was going to meet friends at a ship , but it was so late I decided not to . It 's terribly tiring sitting under those driers . I simply always go home and rest afterwards . Let me see , yes , I 'm certain I must have been back at the Hotel Eden by five . " Miss Dalton paused , making a little gesture of uncertainty . Signaling the wiry little man at the hall door , the D.D.C . received a nod of confirmation , and Miss Dalton , paying no attention to this benediction on her veracity , chirped on : " I picked up my key at the desk  --  got my mail  --  and went up in the elevator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , after I got to my suite  --  I took all my clothes off and just threw myself down to relax . You ca n't relax any other way , a very important East Indian I knew in Paris always said . He said " The heavy-set man , rather tactfully for him , recalled her to her text . " Oh yes , thank you . I must try to remember what I did next . I must have slept a while . I do n't think the phone rang or anyMURDERON THE FACE OF IT 169thing " Miss Dalton frowned prettily . " Oh , I know what itwas that wakened me . It was the phone  --  Miss Mason 's call  --  and then a woman came to my door by mistake . Someone 's governess . She was to pick up a child at a Mrs Dalton 's . She did n't seem awfully bright . Had the wrong hotel , I guess . But goodness , I do n't suppose she 's much good in establishing my alibi . I do n't even know her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , and ask her . " Miss Dalton turned a pair of brightly hopeful eyes on Curtis , who was now studying an invisiblespot on the ceiling . " Well , " she went on , crossing her knees effectively , " someone at the Eden must remember her coming up to my suite . Though she only stayed a minute . I told her at once that I was Miss Dalton , not Mrs. And I explained I simply did n't have any children . I could n't very well , could I , not being married or anything ? " This she addressed to the heavy-set man with widened eyes . He made a peculiar sound , but Susan felt it unfair to believe he muttered what she thought . He looked fatherly even if he did n't sound it . Miss Dalton seemed blissfully unaware of the interruption . Having been deprived of the floor throughout the evening , she appeared determined to make the most of her one opportunity . " But really , " she cried , " I see what they mean by circumstantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing at special times ? I mean if they 've been alone and  --  well , taking a nap for instance ? It 's terribly exciting but dreadfully difficult . " The wiry man had moved across the room . Now he said in a hoarse stage whisper to the men at the table : " Hotel Eden says Miss Dalton came in at five and went out again , dressed in evening clothes , at six-thirty . Not seen in between . Got a telephone call from a woman at a little after six . Elevator boy and clerk both remember the governess who told the elevator kid on her way down about having made a mistake looking for a Mrs Dalton . She said she 'd be late on account of a Miss Dalton having talked her head off . ' " Edith looked becomingly shocked . " How rude ! " she ex-170 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITclaimed . " I only asked her if she was English and said I always thought English governesses were the best , and then it turned out she was French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick irritated gesture with her hands . " Keep your voice down , damn it , " said the heavy-set man to the wiry one . " O.K. , chief . The other thing is , we have n't picked up that Ruby Holt yet . She ai n't been home . " Susan glanced at her watch . It was seven minutes past nine . " Good heavens , " she thought , " can all this have happened in an hour and twenty-seven minutes ? Was it only that long ago that I found Leslie Carleton dead at my feet ? It should be midnightat least . But there 's nothing particularly queer  --  or queer at all , really  --  about Ruby not having shown up at home . Perhapsshe did have a date with some boy  --  movies or something . Perhaps she only said to me that she had nothing to do so that I would n't feel badly about asking her to wait and deliver Camilla 's dress . That would be just like the child . And that bellboy did say she seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the sidewalk . " Curtis was looking now at Ethan . " Van Weck , " he asked , " as a matter of record , where did you go after you brought Mrs Richmond back here to her floor at the Stixman ? You went back down in the elevator and then ? " For once Ethan did not look outraged . He smiled smugly . " And then I took a cab to a newsreel theater on Madison Avenueabove Fifty-first Street . D-did n't care for it . Only s-stayed perhaps twenty minutes . It was f-five past six when I emerged . Then I w-went to the C-chatterbox Bar at Fifty-first and MadisonAvenue for a drink . I arrived at Mrs Van Weck 's place of er  --  ah  --  business at t-twenty-five minutes past six o'clock  --  not twenty minutes of seven as she has m-most erroneously stated . Her w-watch is notoriously fast on all occasions . " Lucinda said a little sheepishly : " That 's right . I always forget . I keep it fast on purpose , matter of fact . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT 171then I forget it is n't right . Well , pet "  --  and she turned to Ethan approvingly  --  " you are sweet to tighten my alibi ! " Ethan gave her a dignified look of exasperation and continued with gravity of tone : " And I did not have to rush like the devil ' with my dressing . I bathed and my man shaved me this m-morning . In any case , my wife 's c-commercial establishment unfortunately does not possess a bathtub or shower . Twenty minutes , I insist , is long enough for any n-normal m-man to p-put on a dinner coat . " Curtis referred to a slip of paper before him on which , Susan had suspected , he was compiling a time schedule out of the depositions . He looked up at Ethan and asked : " Do you say you delivered Mrs Richmond here to this floor at about twentyfiveminutes to six ? The elevator boy knows that Miss Holt arrived at exactly five forty-five and seems to think you and Mrs Richmond came in together and went out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , but with greater thoughtfulness than usual . Then he said : " Not the faintest notion . I only know I left the newsreel establishment at six-five . That was definitely the first time in perhaps two hours that I had 1-looked at the time . Ridiculous , the w-way people are always checking up on time . I only 1-look at my watch when I have an appointment to k-keep . Far too many p-people in the w-world behave like those radio announcers who are always interrupting p-programs to present you with a p-portion of the alphabet got together in highly irregular sequence . D-definitely no point in always knowingwhat time it is . Waste of time , matter of f-fact . Ahem . Quite ! " As Ethan presented them with a period to this disquisition the assistant district attorney turned to Lucinda . " What time did your secretary leave tonight ? " he asked rather cheerfully . Lucinda frowned . " At five-fifteen . " She sounded irritable . " Alone from then until your husband arrived at the studio ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly172 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITher face brightened . " Oh , good heavens , but I was n't ! My dustupmaid was there . I had her stay to take care of ice and things for our highballs . " The D.D.C . signaled the wiry man who again approached the table and again , in a magnificent stage whisper , announced : " Maid was sent out at five thirty-five for club soda . Had to walk to Third Avenue . Did n't get back until six o'clock . Ca n't state where employer was during absence , but found her behind a screen in underwear on return . " " Underwear ! " shrieked Lucinda , horrified . " Ca n't the man possibly manage to say lingerie ? But , of course , few people can ! Susan even has trouble with her staff , and there 's scarcely a store elevator operator in New York who does n't go off the deep end completely with the word ; but still , I definitely object to being described in any such hideous fashion . Especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his eyes . " While your maid was out buying soda were you at the studio all the time , Lucinda ? " Miss Mason looked back at him with her green eyes , squared her shoulders and said : " Do n't be silly . Of course I was , Lyle . " Curtis continued to look at Lucinda for a moment , then said : " Thank you all very much . These alibis are as much for your own protections as anything . . . In the case of a murder , it 's wise for people to be on record as to where they were at the approximate time of the criminal action even when there has been a confession . There 's always the possibility , you know , " he added , Susan thought , somewhat academically , " of the confessedmurderer later claiming confederates . That sort of thing . " He rose . They all rose . Edith Dalton made a beeline for Curtis , reaching him several seconds in advance of what Susan supposed she could have accomplished , had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for once , seemed practically devoid of susceptibility . He replied very tersely to Miss Dalton 's gushings about the excitement of a criminal investigation . His weary eyes and generalMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 173air of abstraction ended by discouraging even her indomitable optimism . She turned to Susan , who had come up finally out of pure pity for Lyle 's haggard face . Miss Dalton began chirpingagain about how exciting everything was , but Susan said coldly : " I 'm afraid we 're all a bit too tired for rehashing this horrible business tonight . You 'll have to excuse my just not feeling like a chat . " She had not meant to be quite so cross and was not further consoled by realizing later that it had been partly the excellence of Edith Dalton 's state of complexion , as well as the kittenish manner , which had exasperated her to the point of open reproval . But as she went down to the street , avoiding Lucinda and the others , Susan found herself just short of too weary to retain an excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't satisfied with Camilla Richmond 's confession . That the D.D.C . was did n't matter . He did n't have to take a dope addict 's word into court and try to win a case on it . " Look , " Curtis had added . " I 'm getting the police to put tails on everybody but you . If you 'll promise to go right home and stay there  --  not off on any private sleuthing brain storm  --  I 'm going to send Sergeant Withers on another little job . " " What ? " Susan had begged , delighted with an official confidence . Curtis had lowered his whisper : " I want to find out how Lucinda treats her animals  --  her dogs  --  in her kennel . I want to know if they customarily cringe but obey . " With that he would say no more , except to warn her again about going straight home and remaining there . Withers was to accompany her that far . She was to double-lock her apartment door . Susan had promised dutifully , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lived without giving the matter prayerful thought . In the Hotel . Stixman lobby Susan glanced at the Western174 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITUnion clock . Just thirty-one minutes past nine o'clock . She wondered if it would delay Sergeant Withers ' Long Island junket too much were she to walk home . She felt desperately in need of fresh air and time to think in it . The sergeant came up to her on the sidewalk . " Sergeant Jones said you took a cab to Miss Mason 's and came over here with the other folks in another cab . Your car 's not working , Miss Yates ? " " Rear-end trouble . They 'll have it fixed by tomorrow , " said Susan and explained her desire for fresh air . Sergeant Withers affably agreed , and they started off in railroad-car processional . CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVETen o'clock in the evening . HALF AN HOUR after Susan had started off , trailed by Sergeant Withers , Lyle Curtis sat down in District Attorney Scofield 's library uptown and said : " I do n't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the way Dugan forced her hand  --  is about as reliable as a three-year-old child 's . " Scofield agreed with booming and bellowing sounds of discontent . Presently he asked to see the time schedule Curtis had prepared .

Why " refused " ? ) MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 179Why was she waiting at Nottinghope for package of cocaine if she expected to get it from Carleton in her suite ? Double supply ? Or did she expect Carleton to double-cross her ? Did Camilla Richmond purposely hesitate over explaining how she had killed deceased ? Or does her nervous state affect her memory ? Why did Carleton 's dog go from Bob Thornton to Lucinda Mason so cringingly ? Find out at her kennels if any evidence of secret cruelty to animals . If she is murderess she may have been forced to be cruel to dog to silence him . Could Lucinda be the " veiled woman " ? Her alibi slim for five thirty-five to six .

Check further with day-service elevator operator ( Stixman ) on whether he could have brought Carleton down from seventeenthfloor earlier than he remembers . Check with Ethan as to whether Edith shook him for a while sometime between five o'clock and the time they arrived together at Stixman . Where is Oscar III 's collar , leash and harness ? Who removed them ? Why ? Could Ruby Holt have been " veiled woman " ? Could she , after delivering box , have hurried around to service elevator , donning veil somewhere en route ?

ETHAN VAN WECK  --  JealOUSy . Ten-twenty in the evening . Scofield looked up from the notes . " You 've forgotten another person , have n't you ? " Curtis was studiously studying the blotting pad on the desk . " There does n't seem much motive for elevator boys , the bellhop , the housekeeper  --  people like that . " " I had in mind , " said Mr Scofield rather diplomatically for him , " that on an official record it would look better to include the person who found the body . " " Susan ! " The name was out before Curtis could quite control his voice . He added in a more official tone : " But she 's been under surveillance , so to speak . Withers and Jones have been tailing her ever since she got that cockeyed fake telegram . " " You do n't know of any motive then ? " persisted Mr Scofield . Before the assistant district attorney 's eyes there swam for a second a confused picture of orchids and two persons in tete-a-tete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever , sir , " knowing it was the second time that day he had led with his chin for Susan . Scofield changed the subject abruptly . " No doubt , " he boomed , " we 've got to be prepared for this Richmond woman 's confession turning out to be either a fake , possibly concocted in order to get the dope , or possibly a clever stall , one of those red herrings you fancy . Have them keep in touch with us from the Tombs . No telling what story she 'll pull next . Maybe she'sMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 181guilty as hell and smart enough to know her confession , under the circumstances , would get her a nice prescription of cocaine but not be worth the price of bilge water as final evidence in court . On the other hand , perhaps she 's convinced she 's committedthe perfect crime and that the presumably phony confessionof a dope addict will throw us off . " The D.A . gestured with a fist toward the telephone . " Get the Tombs now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief conversation Curtis replaced the receiver and leveled his eyes at his chief . " She 's done it . Gegen flage , if I remembermy German , is the name . Complete repudiation as soon as she got the coke in her . Now everything is beautifully an contraire . She never would have thought of killing dear Mr Carleton . Perish the thought . The fact that she signed a confessionbefore they gave her the needle she explains away easily . She was ill . She did n't know what she was doing . " Scofield spat the words : " Oh , she did n't , eh ? " " Certainly not . " And Curtis mimicked what must have been a very ironic tongue at the Tombs end of the telephone wire . " She now insists , " he went on , " that she must sign another statement , before witnesses , saying the medical examiner of the city of New York forced her to lie in order to obtain a drug necessary to her life and health . " " Damn near-sighted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The D.D.C. , according to Jenkins at the Tombs , is wild , " said Curtis . " The papers will have a Roman holiday with it , " observed the district attorney . " Have n't exactly congratulated myself on that Peters case , but I do n't envy the medical examiner and the D.D.C . on this Carleton one . By the way , speaking of Alma Products , another dossier 's arrived from the Paris Prefect on Alma Peters ' maid , the one who went aboard at Le Havre to unpack her . It came through this evening . Billings thought there might be a rush about it and called me here . They still haven't182 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITfound any record of this maid going aboard the Island of Englandand none of her leaving it . Has that been the nonsense all along ? " Curtis nodded gloomily . " Chief Steward Tottingham says she was aboard and that she nearly drove him crazy holding up a long line of people with special instructions regarding Miss Peters ' personal requirements . Le Havre and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the tense international situation , they had tightened up more than usually on ship passes . None , they say , was issued to anyone representing herself as connected with Alma Peters . None was issued to anyone not accounted for . As far as they 've been concerned there just literally was n't any such handmaiden . They 've been sympathetic but suspecting us of a slight case of insanity , I think . Yet Miss Yates says she and the Van Wecks saw the woman . She was n't just a figment of Tottingham 's dotty mental equipment . I 'd like to know where the devil she is . I 've been figuring all along she may know something useful . Perhaps who sent the warning cablegram . Maybe where Alma Peters ' private records were . She may even know , possibly without knowing she knows it , what name the stolen funds were deposited under . " The district attorney looked restless and not a little peevish . " You 're an optimist , Curtis , " he said , and his tone was definitely pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I have my doubts . And , by the time we do , there may be a different district attorney sitting down in Center Street . " Mr Scofield hunched his big shoulders and looked his assistant gloomily in the eye . " You and your ladies , or to be more precise , you and your Miss Susan Yates , have the damnedest habit of being present when deaths occur . You 're almost as good at it as Alma Peters was with disappearance acts . " He grumped caustically . " And that woman was a genius . What she could n't do with stockholders ' dividends nobody could do . They just disappearneatly out of the country . Then she goes to Europe , and her London agent evaporates . Some fellow dressed like aMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 183chauffeur hires a youngster on the street in New York to go into a cable office and send her a warning about not coming back , and he disappears . A maid is seen aboard the ship at Le Havre making arrangements for the cosmetic queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains out , and all her papers disappear . Meanwhile , your Miss Yates is right there in the next cabin , and that 's all the good it does us . The wonder to me is Miss Susan Yates did n't manage to disappear ! " Mr Scofield 's eyes held a fleeting twinkle . Lyle had the uncomfortablefeeling of the young man who dreamed he was walking up Fifth Avenue in a loin cloth . " Next , " boomed the district attorney , " my chief assistant and his best girl go to a dinner party in New York . Miss Yates opens a closet door and out tumbles a corpse . So whether or not the district attorney 's office has its hands full at the moment , and does n't want any murder cases on the docket , we get immediatelyinvolved . Then Dugan makes an ass of himself . Grrumph . It 's a damned nuisance . " Mr Scofield paused to scowl . With unseeing eyes Curtis studied a bronze Napoleon on the broad mahogany desk between them . Then he looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair through the charming channel of a social diversion I 'm inclined to think I better make a night of it ; get downtown and check on the open points in my notes . Any special instructions , sir ? " - Mr Scofield threw back his fat shoulders . " I 'm going downtownwith you . There 's always a turning point in every case . If we get on it tonight while the D.D.C. , Dugan and Camilla Richmondare still flirting with each other over confessions we may know a lot more about several things by morning . You put wheels under those points you 've noted to be checked in your Carleton rehash . I 'm going to keep in touch with the commissioner . " He glanced at his watch . It was ten-thirty . Both men rose and moved toward the hall . With a wry grin Scofield added : " And next time you plan to dine out , my boy , 184 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITjust send Sergeant McQuire or someone around to inspect the premises first . " CHAPTER TWENTY-SIXA few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Withers methodicallystalking her . She waved good night to him , went into the lobby and up in the elevator to her apartment , where her black Lillian looked at her and held up hands in dismay . " You is tuckered out , Miss Susan . Plumb tuckered out . You wants to get right in bed . " In a few minutes she was in a dressing gown and seated before her dressing table with a glass of warm milk brought by the determined Lillian . " Now yo ' tell Lillian what-all has been goin ' on . " Susan gave a brief outline of the evening 's events . Lillian , never long an inaudible audience , held up her hands once more and , reflecting a thought in Susan 's own mind , exclaimed : " Po ' Mister Curtis . Seems like his work ai n't never done . " Susan agreed and began wishing she had n't left the Stixman suite before Edith Dalton . Lillian was evidently psychic this evening , she decided when the negress said : " And another thing I is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind . It seems like to me that Mis ' Edith Dalton person is tryin ' to get the ' tentions of Mister Curtis . She wo n't do him no good . " Wincing at this unexpected discernment , Susan said lightly : " Mr Curtis is a very attractive man . " " He is that . He is too ' tractive . Too ' tractive for his own good . But he don ' want no truck with white trash . The way that woman do carry on . I would like to slap her face . " Susan , soberly inspecting her reflection in the triple mirrorsMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 185of her dressing table , thought : " Next thing I know , Lillian will be feeling presences too . " And then she thought rather regretfullythat it had probably been stupid to lose her temper with Edith Dalton . But what of it ? It was n't civilized going around with people whose faces you 'd like to slap , and in that respect , among others , she concurred heartily with Lillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , who explained in vast detail that she was calling from a drugstore on account of not having no phone in their house , and she was sorry she was sure to be disturbing Miss Yates , but the fact was Ruby had n't come home , and she had n't said nothing about having a date , and there ' d been a man  --  and no gentleman at that  --  around about ten times asking for Ruby . These facts she disclosed in one uninterrupted sentence . Susan wondered what particular detective had obtained for himself Mrs Holt 's censor , but she said that she would n't worry . No doubt Ruby had gone to a movie . Surely she would be home by midnight . " Tell her , " she added , " to run out to a phone and call me when she does get in . There 's something I want to speak to her about . " Mrs Holt agreed with more protestations of regret , she was sure , for having disturbed Miss Yates . When Susan had replaced the receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into bed , but , glancing at the small traveling clock on her dressing table , Susan was astonished for the second time that evening to find it was not later than it was . Only twenty minutes past ten . She had been home less than half an hour . If Ruby had taken three quarters of an hour for dinner , walked any distance at all to a movie , seen perhaps a double feature , then taken the subway to Brooklyn , she could n't have reached home yet . But with a sudden shock an alternative occurredto Susan . Perhaps Ruby , usually conscientious in the extreme , had returned to the shop , after delivering Camilla Richmond 's gown , thinking Susan might phone . What if the girl had fallen asleep there ? Her mother would be frantic if she186 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITdid n't come home , and the police would be suspicious  --  Camilla Richmond 's confession or no . " I 've got a feeling she is asleep , " muttered Susan aloud . Lillian instantly remonstrated : " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undressed and shut yo ' eyes in that bed ? Another glass of hotter milk is what yo ' needs , " and she departedon resolute feet , presumably to enforce her recommendation . Susan reached for the telephone and dialed her salon . The buzzing noise of the bell being rung at the other end had sounded twice and then a third time when there was an abrupt click on the wire . But then nothing happened . No sleepy-voiced Ruby answered . Susan said : " Hello ! Hello ! Plaza 3-0928 ? Hello ! " Again no answer ; then a gruff voice snarled : " Wrong number , " followed by another sharp click of the phone . Susan dialed the number again . No answer . She called the operator and asked her to try it . After another few moments of buzz-buzz sounds with intervening pauses the operator 's voice announced : " I am sorry . That number does not answer ! " She said it with the maddening finality of one not interested one way or another . Susan thought : " Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tails tonight . If her danger had lain in the hands of someone she had been frequently seeing  --  some member of the shipboard group  --  then surely , of all nights , she was safe tonightto go out if she wanted to . Lillian would not like it . Curtis would not like it . But she was n't a baby in their care . And she was somehow sure that Ruby had gone back to the salon . Rising hastily , she went to her wardrobe closet and put out a hand to open the door . She put it out and dropped it again . The moment of pulling open Camilla Richmond 's closet had risen in a sickeningpicture before her eyes . She stood still with a prickly feeling at the back of her neck and in her elbows . " I honestly do n't think I can open it , " she thought a littleMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 187wildly and wished Sergeant Withers were outside to come in and hold his service .38 while she did . It was ridiculous , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with nameless apprehensions . And yet she had heard a shot as the sirens were sounding at Le Havre , and Alma Peters had been next door dead . And there had been someone watching her on the boat deck of the Island of England . She had actually seen It and Its following shadow . And she had received that mad fake telegram . And , there was no use saying it was only imagination , she had felt a tension for weeks among women who visited her salon . Maybe the whole world was going quietly mad . Perhaps only she was . But life was n't at all as it used to be . She was scared . She was scared all the time . And Leslie Carleton 's body had fallen out of Camilla 's closet at her feet . As she stared now at her own closet door it seemed to waver  --  like an object seen through searing sunlight . Was the crack widening ? Was it wide enough for an eye , a gun , a heavens knew what to be behind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 'd be in some nice well-padded sanitarium in no time . She had got to open the door and prove there was no fearsome thing  --  or person  --  behind it . She had got to prove her own sanity . The door was n't moving . There was no widening crack . She was crazy as  --  crazy as  --  as What was that ? Shespun around , her heart streaking downward in her body . But there was nothing . Only steam coming up in the bedroom radiator . Susan turned back to the closet door . " Open it ! " she instructedherself with utmost severity . But her hand seemed to have a different mind operating it . It stayed , trembling , at her side . Again her thoughts became a pandemonium of conjecture . There was some theme , some grim melody , in all that had been happening . But what was it ? Wary eyes . Eyes that smiled and eyes that did not . Doors . Doors closed . Doors open a crack . Doors out of which corpses fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was not thinking . This was Abaddon. 188 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITBut there had been heavily shod feet visible in the crack of the door to Alma Peters ' private suite . Anna , the stewardess , wore such shoes . Why had she stared around her cabin so intently  --  almost insolently ? Had it been Lucinda on the boat deck  --  Lucinda with her following shadow repeated on the lower deck ? Was Lyle really impressed by the impetuous nonsense of Edith Dalton ? Why had n't Camilla Richmond tried harder to save herself tonight ? Why had the ridiculous group from the ship been kept together ? Had it been fate  --  or somebody  --  someone with a reason for maneuvering them all into continued circulationwith one another ? But why ? She could have sold clothes and Lucinda decorations and dogs without all this social business . She could have had her dog-heart business without it . Lucinda and Leslie could  --  possibly had had  --  clandestine rendezvouswithout it . Ethan and Camilla certainly had not depended on mass meetings of the group to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with naturalness  --  until they had spied her . True , she , Susan , could n't have kept an eye on Edith Dalton 's amorous intentions without attending the parties . But , good heavens , things had come to a pretty pass if that was really all which had impelled her . Susan regarded herself in a lopg mirror at one side of the closet door and snapped aloud : " Well , has n't that been your motive , you little fool ? " She could hear Lillian slamming the refrigerator door in the kitchen . She must hurry . Lillian would certainly try to persuade her not to go out again , and she had to go . She was too convincedRuby was still at the salon . It would be very bad for Ruby if she did n't show up at home all night . It would take a lot of explaining to the police . She must open the closet door and get going before Lillian returned with the milk . But again her hand resisted the instructions she gave it . Again , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delirious confusion . Who had given the most parties which hadMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 189kept them  --  the silly little group  --  together ? Who had tripped Ruby ? What had been all that business about the wrong cocker spaniel showing up on Long Island and Oscar II appearing on Lucinda 's studio doorstep the next morning ? Leslie Carleton had given the most parties . And he was dead . He 'd been murdered . Camilla Richmond had confessed . But Camilla had given very few parties . If she was the murderer , she had n't been the one who was trying to keep them together . But Carleton would n't have tried to keep them together in order to get murderedfor his trouble ! He had not even asked Camilla to all his parties . He had n't appeared at any of hers . He had n't seemed to like Camilla . It was all mixed up . Everything was mixed up . But there was n't anything  --  of course there was n't anything  --  behind the closet door . She was an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it . The latch was a little stiffer than the one on Camilla 's had been . She always had to tug at it a little . She had been going to ask the apartment-house management to have it loosened . She tugged now . The door swung open . Her heart made a wild dash up to her throat , then to her toes and back again . But nothing else happened . She stood staring at a perfectly familiar array of objects , day and evening clothes , sports clothes , a row of shoe shelves , a row of hat shelves . She peered down at the floor and up at the ceiling . Nothing but a fragrant aroma of cedar . Not even a speck of dust . It was just her clothes closet , orderly , immaculate . Hurriedly Susan grabbed a dress , coat and hat . She slipped out of her negligee and got them on . She had reached the front door when Lillian started down the hall from the kitchen bearingwith determination a glass of steaming milk on a small silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep it hot for me , Lillian . I 've got to go out a few minutes  --  Ruby Holt  --  her mother 's upset " The door banged , leaving the maid addressingan empty hall. 190 MURDER ON THE FACE OF IT " That chile is crazy with the heat , and it still winter . I got no control over her no mo ' . That 's a fact . " CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENGoing on eleven o'clock . LYLE CURTIS WAS NOT SERENE as he and the D.A . drove downtown , but he would have been less so if he had known that Susan Yates was slipping out of her apartment at just about the same moment . Within ten minutes of Susan 's shouted explanationto Lillian lights began to blaze in the district attorney 's offices . Secretaries and other men normally off duty for the night had been recalled . Scofield 's voice boomed orders and fumed with discontent . The door to the assistant district attorney 's office opened , and Robert Thornton slid in , saying : " Good evening , slave driver , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a big leather chair in one corner of the room and regarded Curtis who sat behind a battery of telephones at his flat-top desk . Curtis had an ear pinned to a receiver . From time to time he changed receivers . He kept saying : " Yes . Yes . Yes . Right . Yes , I have it . " Then he would spit out crisp orders . After some minutes of this he hung up and the phones stopped ringing for a time . Before greeting Thorntonhe glanced at his watch . It was just eleven o'clock . They had left Mr Scofield 's library at twenty-five to eleven . " How ' re the tails doing ? " inquired Mr Thornton . Curtis scowled . " There 's something screwy about this case . Among other things , Camilla Richmond is still merrily repudiatingher confession . " Thornton grinned broadly . " If it were n't so pleasant here , watching you work , I 'd take a run over to the Tombs to see the fun . Anything interesting from your tails ? " MURDER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain amount of color , but I 'll be damned if I know whether it means anything . " Curtis shuffled the pile of memoranda on his desk . " Handmaidens and men seem to be disposed of  --  the Stixman housekeeper , elevator boys and bellhops , all in order . No reason to suspect any of them . The abigail with the apron strings  --  the one who felt a presence and who earlier could n't make her passkey work  --  seems to have had not the remotest connection with the deceased . It would have been so comforting if he once had raped her . She is now sleeping off the evening 's excitement in the Third Avenue Working Girls ' Home . Went straight there from the Stixman . Received no telephone calls . Made none . No evidence whatever that she had the slightest connection with the living Carleton despite her psychic experiences after his death . But Susan Yates told me , anyway , that it was her impression the girl merely thought something had happened to Mrs Richmond , on account of her being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if the others were also sleeping peacefully and draped one leg over the arm of his chair . " At the moment , " nodded Curtis ; " but there 's been a certain amount of activity . Lucinda and Ethan Van Weck checked in at the Hotel Eden for the night about a quarter of ten . She 's got the deceased 's dog with her whose name , in case you 'd like to know , is Oscar III . Withers is on his way to Glen Cove to find out how Lucinda 's dogs react to her  --  whether they always obey commands promptly but cringe . As far as Jones and Dana , who are tailing the Van Wecks , can make out , Ethan and Oscar III are having themselves splendid sleeps . Miss Mason has been more restless . First she made half-a-dozen telephone calls all over the place , talking endlessly to various women friends , passingon the news of the evening . Hulbert , on the hotel switchboard , has picked up all these confabs and has been highly edified at Lucinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made one call to their butler at Glen Cove , saying192 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITthey would be spending the night in town . At six minutes of eleven and right after that call  --  her last from the hotel room  --  ' Miss Mason seems to have become intensively active . First the lights went out in their room ; then she slipped out into the hall . Very quietly . Down to the lobby she went . In the lobby she shut herself in a dial-phone booth and rang up somebody . Impossible to trace call on account of the dial . But Dana listened from the next booth . " Curtis hitched his chair around a fraction of an inch and began reading from the papers on his desk . " Miss Lucinda Mason ( Mrs Ethan Van Weck ) : Hello . Hello ! ( Irritation . ) Oh , now I can hear you . I called you a dozen times between twenty-five to six and six o'clock . I suppose you were still at the boat . I 've been tied up since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Pause . ) But the bitch is all right ? ( Note of excitement in voice . ) ( Pause . ) Well , I do n't like them being together , and I have to stay in town tonight , so you 'll have to take the little angel to the country . ( Urgency . ) ( Pause . ) Yes . ( Pause . ) Just leave the other one there , ca n't you ? ( Irritation . ) ( Pause . ) Good . I 'll come out as early as I can tomorrow . You understand that I want you to separate them at once ? ( Tone of command . ) ( Pause . ) That 's right . Good-by . ( Hurried ) " Bob Thornton unscrambled a leg from the twist he had given it around the thickly upholstered leather arm of the chair . He whistled . " What 's all that about ? " " Search me , " Curtis replied , still staring at his memoranda . There was a puzzled frown around his eyes ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon ? " Thornton 's reply was definite . " Island of England . " He whistled again slowly . " Say , the chief steward 's assistant on her is named Smythers ! " Shortly after ten-thirty in the evening . Susan did not bother to wait for the garage to send around her car . It might not be finished anyway , she thought . She askedMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 193the doorman to whistle for a taxi . A night-hawking one came up after a few moments , and she climbed in . Under the roar of the car 's gears in first she said : " Eighteen East Fifty-seventh Street , and please hurry . " " Oke , " grunted the driver , who looked not unlike a well-done cartoon of several different varieties of murderers . They started east in Susan 's street  --  East Sixty-second  --  and turned south at Madison Avenue . The driver paid attention to the one red light they encountered , but that was apparently his single observationof traffic laws . The rest of the time he hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , lighted apartment houses and drugstores beginning to close up for the night . At FiftyseventhStreet he turned west again and deposited Miss Yates with a jerk in front of her shop 's trim green door with itscolonial fanlight and neat sign : SUSAN YATES , INC . AMERICAN FASHIONS . Susan paid the fare and got out . The cab drove off . The shop , naturally , was dark . She crossed the pavement , drawing her keys from her handbag . Finding the right one by sense of touch , she inserted it in the colonially camouflaged but actually serviceable Yale lock . The door swung in without a sound . Susan raised a hand to find the switch for the foyer light and the other one which would illuminate the salon beyond . At the same time she called : " Ruby ! Ruby ! " and said crossly to herself : " Stop shaking , you idiot . There 's nothing here to be afraid of ! " Somewhere within the darkened interior a faint sound reached her ears as she continued to grope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , but it was like a faint groan . Ah , there was the foyer switch . She pulled it down , but no welcoming light came on . She tried the other switch . Still no light . Suddenly sharp in her mind were Lyle Curtis ' words : " . . . go right home and stay there  --  not off on any private sleuthing brain storms . " Aloud she said with nervous irritation : " What the devil 's the matter with the lights ? " and took a few steps across the cor-194 MURDER ON THE FACE OF I ' 1ridor , reaching out blindly for another switch near the entrance to the salon . It was then that she screamed , every bit as loudly as she had a few hours before in Camilla Richmond 's bedroom . The rough hands that had grabbed her from behind were no less brutal in their grasp than they were startling . But before she could scream a second time one of the hands crushed the sound back into her throat , and a rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same voice that had said " Wrong number " on the telephone ?  - -  muttered : " Pipe down . See ? Ai n't no good in yellin ' yer head off . " For a moment the hard hand over her mouth released it , and she felt something tight and rough snap her wrists together . She started to scream again , but the hand came back fast this time , and the scream ended in a frustrated gurgle in her throat . " Who are you besides being a dame that has a key to this joint ? " demanded the voice . Susan gurgled again and suddenly thought : " It was Lucinda who told Edith and Camilla to beware of my mannequin dummies because any burglar could see them in the dead of night . And it was Ethan who suggested to Lyle that the police might use dummies to frighten night prowlers away . I 've never had anything vaguely resembling a robbery in my shop before , but I seem to have a first-class authentic article on the premises now . Good heavens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps if I 'm docile he 'll grab his loot and beat it . " Somehowthe reality of a burglar , though far from pleasant , was less terrifying than her vague apprehensions . Or was it ? The gruff voice , sounding far from placid , was repeating : " Who are you , I said ? " Susan made further mumbling sounds in her throat . How did the brute expect her to answer while he held her like a combinationpython and man-eating ape ? The intruder seemed , after a moment , to absorb the idea that , under the circumstances , she could n't very well answer . TheMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 195voice said : " Just give me an answer , see ? And no squawking . Get it ? " Susan tried to nod her head up and down , and the hand released her face enough for her lips to move . " I own the place , " she said weakly . " If you want anything just take it and go . I do n't intend to try to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you ai n't goin ' stop me . Ha ! That 's a good one . Hot it is ! " The hand clamped down again . Susan felt herself being propelled none too gently forward and moved her feet with hasty co-operation in the direction her captor seemed to desire . After a moment there was a thump and a scraping sound as if an article of furniture had been kicked around and was being pushed with a foot . Then , abruptly , she was shoved backward and down . She found herself on the hard surface of one of her foyer chairs . It was easy to recognize . She had always thought them the most uncomfortable objects in the world , but Lucinda Mason , who had been her decorator , had called them the latest note in foyer chic . Her mouth for a split second was again released . Then she felt cloth , like a rough handkerchief , being pulled across her face and pressed roughly between her lips . " A gag , " she thought , and her heart fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be able to scream for help , if one were cagey about it , and something indescribably disheartening in knowing that , though help might be right outside the front door , one could n't . The gag was tightened , and her captor began concentrating on tying an extra knot in the rope or whatever it was with which her hands were lashed together behind her back . She heard heavy breathing and smelled garlic . Next she felt the person was pulling something off his own body . Then a strap or a belt touched her hands . She heard it scrape through the centerpieceof the back of the chair and being brought around each side of her body . She could feel the face in the blackness of the foyer close to hers now . The odors of garlic and sweat were inI96 MURDERON THE FACE OF ITtolerable . The strap was pulled taut around her stomach . It was done with no gentleness . Susan felt as if she had been squeezed into a narrow , incredibly tight corset . Behind the gag she groaned faintly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off himself . She could imagine from the sound an end being pushed through a buckle . Then she felt the buckle being clamped down . One of those slide-and-snap things men sometimes wore , she supposed . Was he going to leave it behind ? Could they trace him by it ? Good lord , how fiendishly tight he had made it . Most unnecessarily , too , for she could n't possibly have gotten her hands around to try to unfasten it . And the chances were you could n't trace the belt . You could buy them in ten-cent stores . Millions of them alike . Then the telephone in her office sounded , distantly , as if the intervening doors were closed . The man made no sound , but she felt he was standing tense and indecisive  --  probably afraid to answer and yet afraid not to . Then he moved away from her . She heard his footsteps , heavy but dull , on the thick carpeting . Then she heard a door open . Instantly , much more clearly than when she had called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groan . Whether a man , a woman or a child Susan had no idea . Then a door closed . It had been the door to the balcony stairs , she felt certain . Her heart began seeming to thump in her feet and at the back of her neck . Before it had just seemed to be beating in the pit of her stomach and in her knees . It was still careening around . As the person who had tied her up moved further away she could hear the footsteps more plainly , because he had evidently crossed a corner of the carpeted salon and was now moving down the wooden floor of the hall which connected with the fitting rooms and her private office . She heard another door open  --  her office door . It had a tiny but special squeak . After a minute she heard the rough , deep voice say a muffled " Hello ! " Then silence , as if its owner were listening . Then : " No ! " Susan heard a clock somewhere on some near-by tower strikeMURDER ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a quarter of eleven . It was twenty past ten when I looked at my traveling clock . I must have messed around , telephoning here , having the jitters in front of my closet door and throwing on some clothes , for perhaps ten minutes . It certainly took me less than five minutes to get here , and I 've been here  --  God knows it seems hours  --  but it ca n't be more than ten minutes at the most . " Then her heart stood still . Might she have to spend the night roped and gagged ? Lyle thought her at home and in bed . If the faint moaning on the balcony was Ruby , then some police trail might lead to her there , but it was a faint hope . They 'd been looking for Ruby since the middle of the police investigation at the Stixman . There was one chance ! Lillian . If she did n't come back in whatever Lillian might decide was a reasonable length of time she might call the district attorney 's office . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her call her salon . She only knew that she had muttered something about Ruby Holt and rushed off . Susan became acutely conscious that there were no further sounds from the direction of her office . She listened , straining to make her ears stretch to the furthermost parts of the shop and its workrooms and offices . There were occasional faint sounds from the millinery department on the balcony , but very faint , almost the echoes of groans . Susan 's thoughts began to careen again drunkenly . She began to feel desperately exhausted . The strap binding her against the chair seemed to be cutting her stomach in half . How much more of this agonizing pressure would she be able to stand without fainting ? she wondered , and suddenly found her capacity for thinking less a drunken whirl , more a deadly morass , sucking her down into unconsciousness . With intense effort she tried to raise and throw back her shoulders , to draw in her stomach and thus to loosen the pressure of the belt . The concentrated effort at movement cleared her brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and heavy on the hall floor , softer and more sluggish on the198 MURDER ON THE FACE OF ITsalon carpet . From the direction of the salon door the rough voice spoke : " Do n't feel so smart now , huh ? " Being unable to say anything , Susan said nothing . But the intruder 's presence had further sharpened her wits , brought her back from fainting . She must n't , she thought desperately , she simply must n't faint ! And she must find out what that distant groaning was . The thought persisted that she might have been right in the first place : Ruby might have waited there at the shop for her and fallen asleep . She could have been there when the person with the deep voice  --  the burglar  --  had broken in . The child would have been tied and gagged just as Susan herself had been . But somehow the muffled , infrequent groans sounded only half-conscious , like the moans of a person coming out of ether . And of course she could n't know it was Ruby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confederate of the burglar . However , who else could conceivably be inside the shop ? Suddenly another question shot into the front of Susan 's mind . How had the burglar gotten in ? There had been nothing wrong with the front-door lock . If it had been recently picked , or forced , surely she would have been conscious of it ; her key would not have worked so readily and so smoothly . And the only thing wrong with her shop  --  the only reason she had ever contemplated moving  --  was the fact that there was no rear entrance . She herself occupied the first and balcony floors . There was a handy inside stairway leading to the balcony . ( The burglar must have opened its door for a second before he went to answer the telephone . ) Outside , on Fifty-seventh Street , there was another door to the building , but that door led into a separate foyer , where there was a small elevator which served the upper and completely separate floors of the building  --  residential apartments . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her green colonial doorway , with its traditional fanlight , was definitely the only entrance to Susan Yates , Inc . There was only one other way that a thief couldMURDER ON THE FACE OF IT 199possibly have gained entrance , and she could n't see how that could have been accomplished . A window at the back of her workroom gave on a fire escape . But that window had an iron grille with double bolts on the inside . They were invariably kept locked . The person with the deep voice had laughed nastily after his remark from the direction of the salon door . He seemed now just to be standing still . But why ? Why would a burglar just stand around ? Was he waiting for someone , waiting for something to happen ? What ? Then the telephone rang again . Susan thought : " It must have been about ten minutes since the other call . If it would only be Lyle ! " CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTA few minutes past eleven o'clock . BACK IN CURTIS ' OFFICE the assistant district attorney was looking at Bob Thornton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Island of England ? " " All our tips say yes , but we have n't found anything yet . It 's one of our current joys . " Curtis tapped a pencil on his desk . " Be a good fellow , " he suggested after a moment , pushing a telephone in the general direction of Thornton , " and get in touch with this Smythers . What do you say he is , assistant chief steward of the Island of England ? O.K. Maybe we 've got something . Maybe you have . " Thornton got up and ambled toward the desk . " Who was the bitch your man heard Miss Mason telephoning about ? " he asked . " And why hurry her out of town in the dead of night ? " " Lucinda Mason raises dogs , " said Curtis . " Bitch would be natural for her to use in code talk . An easy way would be to
