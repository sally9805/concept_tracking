Cuba is wallowing in cash . That startling fact was underscored last week when big Cuban American Sugar Co. declared a $53.50 cash dividend on its 7% preferred stock , thus erased all the dividend arrears piled up since 1929 . Coming amid a wave of dividend cuts by U.S. corporations ( TIME , May 25 ) , this fat payment touched off a mild Wall Street boom in Cuban stocks &; bonds . <P> Reason for this island prosperity is sugar , on which Cuba feasts in good times , fasts in bad . Before the war , Cuban sugar was selling for less than a cent a pound in the world market . Now the U.S. Government has contracted for almost the whole 1942 crop ( which was harvested last winter ) at 2.65 a lb . This is the highest price since 1926 , and it gives Cuba a sugar income of more than $200,000,000 this year , almost two and a half times last year ( see chart ) . Sugar accounts for 70 to 80% of Cuba 's total national income . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-loving Cubans . They are guzzling more sweet-tasting rum , screaming at more cock fights , buying more radios and automobiles ( when they can get them ) , using more telephones . The party was pepped up last November when all salaries were boosted 10 to 25% by law ( in April minimums were set at $45 a month in towns , $39 out-of-town ) . The lid almost blew off in January when some 400,000 sugar workers had their wages hiked 50% . Part of these fat raises have since been wiped out by a 40 to 50% jump in living costs ( mostly food ) . <P> Rising wages and rising prices set off such a terrific demand for currency that U.S. banks recently shipped over $40,000,000 in U.S. money to Cuba , where it now giddily circulates on an even Stephen basis with Cuban pesos . To ease the cash shortage further , the Cuban Congress on April 30 approved a new $20,000,000 silver-certificate issue . <P> One big fly in Cuba 's drink is that the U.S. refuses to say what it will do about next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosy side , are pretty sure that the U.S. will not only buy most of the crop but will pay higher prices to boot . Another trouble is the shipping shortage , which makes it hard to import anything on which to spend the island 's new wealth . The 2,500,000-plus tons of sugar now piled high in Cuba for lack of ships to carry it 200 miles to Florida are a sign in reverse of the difficulty of getting U.S. goods to Cuba . Unable to spend much cash offshore , Cuba is doing a good job of putting her own business and Government finances in tiptop shape . The Government has paid off $1,838,500 of its $118,555,000 external debt since Jan. 15 alone . <P> Even though Cuba is rolling in sugar money , the Good Neighbor Policy goes on pouring U.S. Government funds into Havana . Cuban diplomats are now dickering for the first chunk of a $25,000,000 Export-Import Bank loan granted over a year ago . Eventually Cuba will take up the whole loan , spend the cash for highways , port facilities , sanitation works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will flow through Cuba . "
