The steel shortage has cut deep into the production of big corporations . For many a small manufacturer it has been a worse misfortune ; some have been forced to shut up shop completely . To head off this blight to business , the Senate 's Small Business committee is trying to find out why small buyers can get no steel . What it found out in hearings last week was that little businessmen can buy steel-if they are willing to pay fabulous prices for it . <P> One small businessman named David Hillstrom , proprietor of the Corry-Jamestown Manufacturing Corp . of Corry , Pa. , testified that in the last year he has paid $206,000 above the mill price for sheet steel . And he paid $18,000 more for steel he never got . He is now paying from $250 to $280 a ton for sheet steel ( mill price : $50 a ton ) to keep his plant going . <P> Arthur Boehn , of Cleveland 's Boehn Pressure Steel Corp. , said that his company had paid up to 14 a pound ( mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in disgust , laid off his 100 employees , shut his plant . <P> Market In Grey . Solely responsible for this state of affairs was the " grey market daisy chain " of steel brokers . The committee was not able to pin down the exact workings of the grey market . But the plain assumption was that steel flowed into it from brokers able to buy from mills , by virtue of prewar dealings , or from manufacturing companies with excess supplies . Instead of canceling their mill orders , as they usually would , these companies took delivery and turned the steel over to brokers at a fat profit . As each party in this daisy chain got his cut , the price was run up and steel was kept out of the normal channels which supply small businesses . The fantastic workings of the chain were described by two would-be steel-buyers , L. C. Durham and E. A. Kerschbaumer . <P> Durham , a Chicago fabricator and steel broker , joined the daisy chain through a broker named McAleer , who phoned him long distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said McAleer , he could buy 100,000 tons of steel . Too eager to pack , Durham grabbed a spare shirt , flew to New York , and hurried to the rendezvous in a suite in Manhattan 's Hampshire House . <P> Marine Rescue . The suite was in the name of Kerschbaumer , a Pittsburgh supplier , who had been lured there himself by a promise of 300,000 tons of steel . Also present were middlemen , lawyers , and " company representatives " who assured the buyers that they would have confirmation of the orders from the mills in the morning . <P> But confirmation did not come the next day , nor for six weeks thereafter . Durham , who expected to go home daily , washed his linen in the bathtub . Kerschbaumer , who claimed he had a $40 million letter of credit to back up his bid , said he also agreed to pay the supposed mill representatives a bonus of $18,000,000-at around $62 a ton-for distribution among mill executives . Still he could not close the deal . <P> One Brooklyn exporter named James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he burst in with two " very apparently gangster types " with guns , demanded 50,000 tons of steel " or else . " Durham , a husky exMarine , happened to walk in just then and " removed them of their guns . "
