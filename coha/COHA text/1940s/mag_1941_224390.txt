Although it has almost deified " Mother , " Western civilization is essentially patriarchal . But a genuine matriarchy in the heart of Florida was surveyed last week by Ethnologist Alexander Spoehr in a new Field Museum publication . <P> Spoehr has hobnobbed with the 600 surviving Florida Seminoles , " the descendants of that handful of conservative Indians who refused to move west to Oklahoma with the main body of the tribe after the Seminole wars of the 19th Century . " <P> The Cow Creek Seminoles live in 20 scattered camps , " cluttered with dogs , pigs , chickens and small children , through which mlange the women calmly move . " Though every good matron owns an antique Singer sewing machine , their other modern conveniences are rarely more than battered old lard pails . Of their social structure Spoehr writes : <P> " The membership of the camp is based on the matrilineal lineage . A camp is usually composed of a woman , her daughters , and their children , and the husbands and unmarried brothers of these . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even women more remotely related , together with their husbands and children . But in any event a basic rule is observed-the women in a camp belong to one clan . . . . When a man marries , he goes to his wife 's camp , builds her a house , and moves in . Later on , if the two of them do not get along , a divorce is effected simply by the husband 's . . . moving out . " <P> These Seminole ways confirm Robert Briffault 's assertion in his great study of matriarchies , The Mothers , that patriarchal marriage and the patriarchal family are " relatively late products of social evolution . " Mother-dominated societies came first . Big reason : among primitive folk , sexual relations are often so free that only a child 's mother is identifiable .
