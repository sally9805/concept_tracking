To leathery , hard-bitten General Joseph W. Stilwell went the final practical proof of what the textbooks had told him 40 years before at West Point : there is more to war than just fighting . Last week " Uncle Joe , " hero of Burma and the U.S. 's No. 1 soldier in China , was summarily relieved and ordered home . <P> The White House announcement , published only three months after Stilwell had been made the Army 's sixth four-star general , * was a crisp , close-mouthed paragraph . It gave no explanation of General Stilwell 's unceremonious removal from his glamorous list of jobs as 1 ) Chief of Staff to Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek ; 2 ) Deputy to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten . Commander in Chief of Allied Forces , Southeast Asia ; 3 ) U.S. Commander of the China-Burma-India theater . <P> But informed newsmen could and did speculate , and on one point they were agreed : somehow Soldier Stilwell had been caught in the swirling crosscurrents of global politics and washed off his feet . <P> Off to Chungking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero 's height since the grim spring of 1942 when he retreated through Burma and marched over the mountains into India with his famous summary of an inglorious campaign : " We got a hell of a beating . " Since then he had trained a new army , fought back across north Burma through the monsoon , had all but finished the opening of a new supply road to China across jungles and mountains . <P> From Chungking came censor-blurred reports of " Vinegar Joe 's " further doings . There were reports of a new training plan for the Chinese Army . There were reports of more supplies to be sent into China over the Burma-Ledo road when it was finished . Backgrounding all the rumors were the delicate political situation in China , the conflict of Chinese and British interests in southeast Asia , and the pressure of Communists in and out of China . Army men , who knew about Chinese-speaking Joe Stilwell 's blunt forthrightness , reflected that his job called for the diplomacy of a super-Eisenhower . <P> In September of this year , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Stilwell came back to Chungking to see his chief , the Generalissimo . With him came another American soldier . Suave , worldly Major General Patrick Hurley , emissary of the White House in high diplomatic affairs , settled down in Chungking to confer with the Generalissimo and work out a new solution for the Asia Command . The conferences proceeded . Pat Hurley was hopeful . <P> In the middle of this delicate diplomatic situation , something unexpected happened . Something like an ultimatum was delivered to the Generalissimo , insisting that he give Stilwell full command of the Chinese armies . Whatever may have been its justification , it was a proposition that no self-respecting head of a state , at war more than seven years , could accept . <P> The sequel was inevitable . Stilwell and Chiang must part . <P> Still in China , still the hero of the people and the confidant of the Generalissimo was Major General Claire Chennault with his small but effective air force ; still in China were thousands of U.S. technicians . U.S. aid to China would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China last week were helpless to define . At week 's end the Associated Press received this dispatch :
