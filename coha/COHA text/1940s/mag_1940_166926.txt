Centrepiece of a National Home Show which opened in Louisville last week was a low , rambling white house built inside Jefferson County Armory in five working days , complete with garden , fireplace , tangerine linoleum , taffeta bedspreads and soap in the soap dishes . <P> A first-night crowd of 12,000 thronged happily through this new Kentucky home . At show 's end it will be torn down , erected permanently in a Louisville suburb for sale at $8,250 . Designed by Treanor &; Fatio , swank Manhattan architectural firm , whose house commissions normally run from $25,000 up , it was the first LIFE house of 1940 to be completed . <P> Abuilding last week all over the U. S. were 98 other LIFE houses . They are planned to show how readily any family earning from $2,000 to $5,000 a year may get an efficient , pleasant house . They will cost from $2,850 to $6,900 ( with land , up to $10,000 ) . Eight top-architectural firms designed the eight houses at nominal fees : Cameron Clark ; Gardner A. Dailey ; Holabird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Hepburn ; Shaw , Naess &; Murphy ; Shreve , Lamb &; Harmon ; Treanor &; Fatio . <P> In itself , no one of LIFE 'S houses is a final architectural answer. * But together they tot up to a highest common denominator of good U. S. design . Laymen who looked at them could see the shape of housing things to come : a decline of the dining room , an increasing use of plywood-the club sandwich of wood and glue that can lick its weight in steel . <P> Every homeowner knows that where to put the garage is a perennial problem . For convenience , it should be near the front of the lot , but never looks right there . If put in back , its driveway wastes much of a small lot 's area . Most ingenious solution among the LIFE houses : Howe &; Brown 's garage attached to a covered porch which half conceals it , serves also as a sheltered passageway to the front door . <P> * Development of two " perfect houses , " after three years ' study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Northeastern Home Foundation . Standard five-room jobs , of one and two stories respectively , they will sell for about $4,000 and $5,000.
