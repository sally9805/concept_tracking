For three days , Joe Louis lay low in Harlem . Then the champ , smoked out by the New York Post 's Columnist Jimmy Cannon , talked for three hours about the fight* without once mentioning the name of his opponent , Jersey Joe Walcott . " He did so many wrong things , " said Joe , " I saw every opening , but I could n't go get him . ... I could n't do a lot of things . " The trouble was , said Joe , he was dehydrated . " I killed myself taking off four pounds . But that ai n't no excuse . " <P> Two days later Joe Louis showed up at the opening of a new Negro nightclub . He was now a partner in a publicity outfit , and the nightclub was one of his clients . Already the owner of a soft drink called " Joe Louis Punch , " the champ was thinking of going into the beer business too . What about the next fight ? To a gathering of reporters , Louis announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that was all . " I had enough . I been around a long time . " Joe said he 'd like to fight either Joe Walcott or Light-Heavyweight Gus Lesnevich . Nobody took the remark seriously : it was obviously part of the maneuvering to scale down Walcott 's terms for a return match . At least there 'd be an anguished outcry if Joe Louis fought anyone but Walcott . A reporter asked Louis : did he have enough money to retire ? " Yeah . " Then , with a grin : " I can always go back to the Ford plant . I 'm on leave of absence . " <P> <P> *Correctly described by Franklin P. Adams as " a 15-round bout at fisticuffs between Mr. Barrow and Mr. Cream . "
