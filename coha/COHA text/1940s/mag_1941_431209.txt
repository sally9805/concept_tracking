MASS-PRODUCTION education has MASS-PRODUCTION been adopted by the Army to train rookies for the recently organized Armored Force . And it is working so well that graduates are pouring from the Armored Force School at Fort Knox , Ky. , into the service at the rate of 400 to 500 a week . Because tanks are the backbone of the force , a large percentage of the graduates are " tankers . " That means that they have completed a rigorous three-months course in which they were taught to drive and care for a tank , read maps , use and maintain rifles , machine guns , and 37-mm. or  | 15-mm. guns , the latter depending n whether they will be assigned to ght tanks which are fitted with the 7-mm , or medium tanks which arry the 75 's . The Armored Force is proving highly popular with recruits , but soildiers with a yearning to become hell-buggy " drivers have a good hance of getting what they want . By next June the Army will have : our armored divisions , with 1,000 light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54 light or medium tanks each . Since ach member of a tank crew ? four hen in a light tank , five in a tedium ? must be able to fill alost any job in the tank , that leaves plenty of room for trained tankers . And the Army is already planning nother six armored divisions . There are no special requirements or tankers , though soldiers with mechanical ability and a good record their general aptitude test are referred . But a recruit has to itisfy his instructors in the course - hat he will make a tanker , or he s dropped . Before a recruit even approaches driving lesson , he has to learn the general characteristics of the type f tank to which he will be assigned . If it is an M2A4 , the standard army light tank , weighing 111/2 tons , he learns that it will make better than 50 miles per hour on a highway , and up to 30 cross-country , and that ur army officers consider it the best little juggernaut of its kind in the world , superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a medium-tank regiment , he gets an earful about the M2 , a 20-ton job officially apable of 32 miles per hour on highways and up to 20 cross-country . Then things come thick and fast . One day the budding tanker takes riving lessons . The next day he -. viii work in classrooms , studying racks , engines , transmissions , and other complicated parts . The first steps in the driving are learned with the tank standing still , as even a light tank costs more than $20,000 , and the Army does n't want to spoil any . The student is plopped into the driver 's seat on the left side of the tank . Under each hand he finds a ' joy-stick , " each with an electric : rigger connected to fixed machine  | guns in the sides which are aimed by aiming the whole machine . The only familiar items will be the clutch and accelerator , which are like those in an automobile . " Pull back on the right stick , and the tank will turn to the right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank to that side . Because the control sticks are attached to two brake bands in the transmission , each of which controls one track , pulling back on both at once will stop the tank . It sounds easy until the student finds that to operate the gearshift lever , mounted on a huge six-speed transmission , he has to let go of one control stick . The transmission , incidentally , snuggles right alongside his right leg , and gets unpleasantly hot when the tank is under way . Once he has mastered the theory with the tank at rest , he learns to operate the vehicle on smooth ground , first in low gear , later in higher gears and at higher speeds . The final phase is cross-country work , which means anything from bouncing over stone walls at 20 miles per hour to burrowing through ditches and shoving over threeinch trees . He must learn , for instance that if he does n't " give her the gun , " when his tank noses down a steep pitch , it may roll right over on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate open in front of the driver , enabling him to see where he is going . Now he must learn to drive the tank when it is " buttoned up , " with all the armor in place and his only means of looking out a narrow slit . He begins to develop sensitive shoulders , because the tank commander , who has slits on all sides of him and can therefore see all around even when the turret top is closed , directs the driver with the toe of his boot . This is necessary because the inside of a tank under way is noisier than the proverbial boiler factory , and even shouted commands are inaudible . In tanks equipped with radios , such as platoon and company commanders ' , the assistant drivers must be radio operators as well as gunners and drivers . Recruits with an ear for code are trained for this duty after learning the other aspects of tanking . It is not an enviable position , because in action the operator must be able to tune his set and hear what is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casings from the 37-mm. gun in the turret and the  | machine gun beside his seat pouring down upon his head , possibly down his neck , if he forgot to button his collar . To protect the tankers from bruises when the tank is bumping acrosscountry , special crash helmets are provided , though even with them tankers have been knocked unconscious when the vehicle took a particular vicious bump at high speed . Khaki overalls are standard uniforms , and they rarely stay clean long . After each day 's run , a tank crew must inspect their machine , report any necessary repairs to the company commander , fuel and lubricate the buggy for the next day , and , if at a home station , clean the tank as well . In the meantime , the tanker has been learning how to care for and make minor repairs to his tank and its power plant . He has studied the general theory of the four-cycle , internal-combustion engine ; then he specialized in the type of engine which he will find in the regiment to which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a seven-cylinder , radial , air-cooled 250 - horsepower gasoline engine , or a Diesel of similar type and power . In the M2 it is a more powerful radial gas engine . The end of the school course does n't mean the end of his training for a tanker , however . After he is assigned to a regiment . there are cross-country marches , gunnery practice , and night maneuvers to keep his mind on his job . For the more - ambitious recruits who wan : quick promotion , there are study courses and examinations . And although a tanker probably wo n't find a job driving a tan : : when he returns to civilian life , it 's a salbet that he will be far wiser about the workings of gears and internal combustion engines . He may even find that he is a better automobile driver .  |
