After the concert , the Minneapolis Symphony 's conductor greeted a five-year-old backstage visitor . Patting the small , curly head , the conductor asked : " And what do you expect to do when you grow up , little man ? " The boy replied : " Direct a symphony . I 'll conduct your orchestra , too . " <P> This week Victor Alessandro , 29 , is making good his 24-year-old threat . From the podium of Oklahoma City 's Municipal Auditorium he will guest-conduct the Minneapolis Symphony . And the experience will not be particularly novel . In the past six years , small , stocky Conductor Alessandro has led his own Oklahoma <P> State Symphony through some 100 concerts from the same platform . <P> Self-assured Victor Alessandro became a conductor by the practical process of building up an orchestra of his own . When he finished studying in Rome and Salzburg ( 1938 ) , he shrewdly left Eastern music centers , to return to the Southwest where there is more musical room-at-the-top . He took over the struggling , WPA-financed Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big oil men who had sneered at the WPA 's " Roosevelt fiddlers " liked Alessandro 's orchestra and kept it going when the Federal funds stopped .
