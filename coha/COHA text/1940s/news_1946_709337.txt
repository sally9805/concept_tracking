txt A bitter exchange between John L. Lewis and Charles O'Neill , spokesman for the bituminous operators negotiating committee , marked the session of the coal wage conference today when the operators charged that the miners had , by " filibustering , " wasted 20 per cent of the time set aside for negotiation . Mr. Lewis denied that the miners ' speakers had wasted time and challenged the operators to leave if they wished . He shouted : " You dare not leave the conference . You dare not leave the record unanswered . If you could muster up the courage to leave you will be back . " Whom would you get to operate the mines ? Who would patronize your company stores and your company doctors ? What corpses would you practice on ? Surely you know nobody else would enter your mines . No other group of Americans would have the courage . " The clash occurred at 5 o'clock after Mr. Lewis moved to adjourn until tomorrow . Mr. O'Neill , stung by the " indictment " leveled at the coal operators by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and charged that for three days he and his associates had been forced to listen , . to cases . of local conditions in the various coal corn- , munities and that , because these were local , " the operators could do nothing about 99 and 9-100 per cent of them . " Mr. O'Neill asserted : " This conference can not arrange for an ambulance to be at a coal mine in Kentucky right after an accident . Called " Not Appropriate " " We can not do anything about many of these things discussed here for three days . They are not appropriate to this meeting . We have gathered to make a national ' wage agreement and to assure the nation of its fuel supply . " We can not discuss company doctors and hospitals . Difference of workmen 's compensation laws between the States are matters for the citizens and Legislatures of those States . " Mr. O'Neill suggested that when the operators received the miners ' demands three days ago they believed that the detailed explanation of why the demands were presented could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the six district presidents who took the floor today , said Mr. O'Neill , could have been covered in the March 12 document . He added : " There has been repetition after repetition . It makes us form the opinion that this is a filibuster and we can no longer be patient . " After pointing out that three out of fifteen days set aside for negotiation already had elapsed , he said that " the ceaseless and endless repetition " was a waste of time and had reached a point " where we are beginning to look a little ridiculous . " " Endless Repetition " Charged Mr. O'Neill told the miners they nact a right to present their demands and to demonstrate their soundness at a preliminary meeting like the one under way , but he protested against " this endless repetition . " Mr. Lewis replied that he could understand why Mr. O'Neill and his associates felt " incapable " of answering the " barrage " of arguments leveled against them in relation to health and safety conditions in and around the mines . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of thousands of miners and " to say that these matters are unimportant , belies the facts and is an insult to the intelligence of thousands of mine workers who rely on . the coal industry for their livelihood . " He continued : " The practices of doctors and hospitals in mining communities are germane to the creation of a health and safety fund . The con-1 consideration of this subject has been1 long delayed and remedies for these conditions must be found if the nation is to be guaranteed enough coal to sustain the eco nomic structure of the land . " On this question depends whether men will be maimed and . butchered in the mines or whether they will find jobs in other industries as they did during the war when they ) took other jobs because of low wages in the coal mines . " Lewis Defends Statements The union president explained that the reason why the district presidents had each explained conditions in his own area was so that the operators could not say that ) they had not brought up the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Virginia that coal operators had withheld nearly $1,000,000 due the men , and said that he did not mean to say that operators in every district had stolen that much money . He continued : " We regret the ' necessity of say-1 ing these things and chronicling these details , but I do n't know of any other industry where these things could be said in this or any other country . " At this point Mr. Lewis charged that " the operators practice extortion from the cradle to the grave , " that " from the time a child is born until his corpse is laid away " the operators benefited . He said that he could recognize the " impatience " of the operators on hearing the recital by the miners and understood that " their souls are tortured on hearing the facts . " " But you asked for it , so take it , " he added . The fact that the stories told in the last three days were " repetitious and boresome , " he said , was " a matter of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 28,000 Dead ' Earlier in the day Mr. Lewis summed up a report of a union committee , which had visited coal towns to investigate health conditions , by reading a solemn " indictment " which charged that the coal industry , in the last fourteen years , " through mismanagement , cupidity , stupidity and wanton neglect , " had " made dead 28,000 mine workers . " In a deep voice Mr. Lewis read from the " indictment " a charge that " the industry extorts annually from the pay envelopes of the mine workers sixty million dollars for pseudo-hypothetical and substandard medical service , hospitalization and insurance of an actual value of less than one-third of the aforesaid sixty million dollars . " Archibald Woods , a member of the union committee which had investigated medical service , charged a big West Virginia mining company with " body snatching , " charging that the company operated a funeral home and had in some cases taken bodies of miners killed in accidents and embalmed them without the consent of survivors . Other speakers were John Owens of Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kentucky and James Mark and Frank Hughes of Pennsylvania .
