Since the world of fashion can not , at the moment , visit Paris , Paris intends to visit the world . Last week 35 leading couturieres ( Schiaparelli , Lucille , Lucien Lelong , et al. ) were showing off their latest concoctions in advance of an international tour . The 200 models ( soon to visit the U.S. , Britain and South America ) were 18-inch wire dolls . Ace Artists Jean Cocteau and Christian ( " Bb " ) Berard painted the miniature sets . To help revive its fashion industry , Paris launched the show with full fanfare-in the Louvre .
