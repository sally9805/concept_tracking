Until six months ago , short , rubicund Morton Smith was a typical radio ham . His house in hot , humid San Fernando Valley was equipped with a 1,000-watt transmitter , was located in the best sending and receiving area around Los Angeles . Then NBC , for which Amateur Smith works as engineer , decided to set up a listening post on the West Coast to keep tabs on the Far Eastern end of the Axis . Picked for the job was Morton Smith 's little station . Last week the post got under way . <P> The equipment NBC installed in the garage adjoining Engineer Smith 's pleasant stucco house was similar to that used in its Long Island listening post . It has three receivers constantly beamed on Tokyo , Saigon and Chungking . The three receivers are due to be manned from 4 a.m. to early afternoon , best time for the area covered , and will be monitored at other times when hot news is expected or when reception at the Long Island listening post is bad . <P> Biggest difficulty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . Having consulted all possible sources from missionaries to naval intelligence men , NBC finally decided to try a Los Angeles court interpreter . Barred were local Nisei ( second-generation Japanese ) on grounds that they might indulge in favoritism.
