Supersonic speeds ( above 750 m.p.h. ) are farther around the flying corner than many people think . On Jan. 26 , a P-80 Shooting Star , in a widely publicized flight , roared from California to New York at about 584 m.p.h . But its speed was inflated by a whooping , high-altitude tailwind . Last week , the Army Air Forces announced the official record for a closed , 100-kilometer course-only 495 m.p.h . <P> That was one piece of news for the 200 reporters who last week went to Wright Field to view the Army Air Forces ' latest advances toward the Buck Rogers age of flying . Other news was scarce ; " security " is still a military watchword . <P> Besides off-the-record glimpses of future murders , the visiting newsmen saw an exciting finish to a record-breaking B-29 flight . Just over the finish line , the B-29 plunged down , trailing smoke like a rocket , but somehow landed safely . The record ? 2,000 kilometers at 361 m.p.h. with a 2,000 kilogram payload .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
