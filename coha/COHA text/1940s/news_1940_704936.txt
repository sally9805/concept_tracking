txt The current Justice Department anti-trust drive in the defense industries marks a concerted effort to bring about abrogation of certain patent and marketing control agreements made between American and foreign firms in the early 3920 's The agreements , the Justice Department charges , have prevented American manufacturers of certain types of militarl , equipment . much of it essential to the defense program , from reducing prices to the , War and Navy departments and has prohibited those companies from selling to British and South American nations except at exorbitant prices . In some cases the old agreements have required the American firms to pay royalties to foreign corporations on United States Government contracts even though the American firms have held the patent rights on the equipment sold . Abrogation of one of these international agreements has already been brought about by Justice Department action , and officials plan to place still other cases before federal grand juries in the near future . These cases , it was stated authoritatively , will affect several large , nationally-known firms supplying material to the War and Navy departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the companies involved plan to cooperate with the Justice Department in dissolving these agreements . Grand jury indictments probably will be obtained first and the action will then be settled via the consent decree method , although in some instances an informal settlement may be arranged before an indictment if the agreements themselves contain cancellation clauses . Justice officials do not expect any of the cases ter- go to trial . . Briefly , the general situation in these cases is that in the years following the World War the American firms involved entered into agreements with foreign companies , mainly German . manufacturing the same article to divide up world markets and provide minimum prices . Generally the American company 's action was taken to prevent the cheaper foreign commodities from flooding the American market . By these agreements the American firm usually agreed not to sell its product in world markets or to an American purchaser whc would ship the product into world markets . The foreign firm , on the other hand , agreed not to sell in the United States . Justices Department officials here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that represented by the pending suit against major oil companies in connection with pipe line operations . They concede that the oil case may be withheld if the National Defense Advisory Commission so requests because the arrangement itself being attacked may be useful to the defense program . But in the cases involving the international agreements , the arrangements attacked as illegal actually impede the defense program , according to Justice Department officials . Cites Previous Case In many of these cases , according to department officials , the United States Government has been paying royalties to foreign companies on equipment the patent rights of which are held by domestic companies , and in addition has been forced to pay " unreasonable and arbitrary prices " fixed by the foreign companies . The general pattern of these agreements and of the method used to secure their abrogation , according to department officials , is laid out in the anti-trust action against Bausch &; Lomb Optical Co of New York . An indictment was returned last March against Bausch &; Lomb and the company , under court- order , dissolved its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into with Carl Zeiss of Germany and the N. V. Nederlandsche Instrumenten Compagnie of Holland , a Zeiss subsidiary . This agreement dealt with the sale of such military instruments as periscopes , range finders , altimeters , boresights , torpedo directors , and sights for guns for use with battleships , cruisers , submarines , aircraft and anti-aircraft guns . By the terms of this agreement , Zeiss agreed not to sell in the United States except with the permission of Bausch &; Lomb , and Bausch agreed not to sell outside of the United States . In the case of sales to ships built for use outside the United States , Bausch agreed to sell only with Zeiss permission and at a price agreed upon between the two firms . Technical Knowledge In case Bausch &; Lomb was forced to bid on a contract moving outside the United States . it agreed to mark up its bid 20% . If it were rewarded the contract despite the markup , it agreed to remit the markup to Zeiss . While the details of this agreement differ from those of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the general arrangement is the same in most cases .
