IT HAS taken us a long time to agree on the precise words in which the issue of this war should be put , but we have always known in our bones what the issue was . We have always realized that what was at stake was the relation of individual men and women to the governments under which they lived . We have realized that the outcome of the war would determine how individual men and women would live under government for generations to come  --  and not only in fascist countries and in the countries conquered by the fascists but in other countries as well , even our own . We have known , that is to say , that the basic issue of the war was- whether men were to live from this time forth as citizens of a nation or as subjects of a state . And there was something else we knew also . We knew that this same issue would be the issue not only of the war but of the peace . For we realized  --  and it was this that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in definite and certain words  --  we realized that the war could not itself resolve the issue which produced it . Or rather the war alone could not decide that issue in our favor : it could , against us . If the fascists won , men everywhere , in this country as well as in other countries , would come to live , sooner or later , as subjects of a state . In a universe of ant coronies no ants can survive which do not organize and discipline themselves on the helot model . If we won , men would have at least a chance to live as citizens of a nation . There would be a chance to construct men 's lives on the surface of the earth in the free light and sweet air , rather than underground in the mutually exclusive , darkly hateful , armed and ignorant corridors of the colonies of ants . It was , I think , because we saw very well that to win the war was not thereby to win the issue of the war , while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it sb difficult to put our purpose in the war in words . But now that our victory in the war itself is certain  --  now that the defensive victory in arms is sure  --  the difficulty of the declaration of our purpose disappears . We can declare a purpose in the making of the peace which we could not have declared with confidence in the waging of the war . And that purpose is not peace . Peace can never be a purpose in itself , for peace , like war , is a resultant , and those who try to seize it in itself , like those who grasp for images in water , will lose the gains they have . Our purpose is a world in which a peace will be conceivable . Which means a world in which the power will be held by those who do not wish for war . Which means , in turn , a world in which the people hold the power . Our purpose in the peace is the affirmation of our purpose in the war . In the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens to subjects . In the peace we aim to make a world in which men everywhere shall live as citizens  --  a world in which no ant-hill state shall dig us down to slavery and darkneSS by the dread of war . I say that is our purpose . I mean , it should be . If we intend the words we speak about the war , our purpose , now the war is ending , will be this . There is no possibility of peace but in the practice of democracy , and there is no possibility of the practice of democracy if any corner of the world is held by fascist power , armed and prepared for war  --  or arming and preparing . If we mean what we have said , if we mean to make a peace , then there is no stopping in our purpose short of this  --  this purpose : a world in which men everywhere shall live as citizens , a world in which the people shall possess the power . And not here alone , or in the countries of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we truly mean this ? Do our agents and our representatives in other countries mean this ? Do party leaders , candidates for office , makers of opinion mean this ? DO we ourselves , as a people , as a nation , mean this ? To mean that the ant-hill state shall be destroyed throughout the world , we must intend that men shall rule themselves throughout the world . We must advance , not for ourselves alone but for the people everywhere , the great American proposition on which the founders of this nation stood . We must believe positively and not passively , literally and not as a figure of speech , that the people ought to govern themselves because the people can govern themselves , and because the government of the people by themselves will make for peace . And do we believe it ? Do we believe it , now , in fact , of all men , everywhere  --  and mean it ? We have made a practice of dividing the parties to this war into democrats and fascists , ourselves and the dictators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this issue of the peace is not so simple . There are men other than the men now or lately in control of Germany and Italy and Japan who do not in truth and fact believe in the people and in their right to rule themselves . Some of them , like the masters of the fascist states , disbelieve in the people because they despise the people , or because they fear the people , or because they want what the people might not wish to 510 The NATION let them have . But there are others , and they are not few , and they do not live in Germany only or in Italy or in Japan , who disbelieve in the people not because they despise the people , or hate the people , or fear them , but for an honest reason , a regretful reason  --  because they doubt the ability of the people to govern in the modern world , because they think the complexity of the modern world is such that the people can not possibly comprehend it and can not , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real enemies in the struggle for the peace we say we want are these men , not our enemies in arms . It is because of them that the struggle for the peace is doubtful . The doubtful struggles are the struggles in which no one knows his adversary  --  in which the adversary may walk beside him as a friend  --  may even be himself . And this is such a conflict . If the division were clear , if we on our side were united in acceptance of the proposition that the people can and ought to govern , there would be no question , about the making of a successful peace . If we and our principal allies in the war were so united , there would be no question . Indeed , if even we alone , we Americans who first advanced the proposition of the people , were united-in a firm and fierce belief , the question would be answered . But are we so united ? I am not thinking , when I ask this , of the practical politicians who sneer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that the Chinese can , or the Negroes in Mississippi . I am not thinking of the cynical men , or the selfish men , or the interested men ! , or the evil men . I am thinking of the rest , who are not cynical or evil . I am thinking of those who describe themselves as realistic and disinterested observers of their time  --  those who have seen what they have seen , those who put realities above the rhetoric no matter who composed the rhetoric , even Lincoln . I am thinking of the disinterested observers who will tell you that the proliferation of printed matter in our time ' has become so vast and measureless that it threatens to bury the libraries , and that no citizen , no matter how conscientious , can learn a fraction of the things he needs to know to know his duty ; of the students of technical matters who remind you that the multiplication of skills and crafts in our epoch has become so great , and the elaboration of technologies so intricate , that few citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses of the citizens can comprehend how the things they use and need the most are made ; of the economists who point out that ours is a period in which the operationsof commerce and of banking are so delicately and mysteriously adjusted that the writing of a number on a blackboard in New York may shake the lives of - men and women in Australia by means no common citizen can comprehend ; of the scholarly persons who remark that science in our generation has given over the explanation of the mysteries that every man can see , and has disappeared instead into the invisible world beyond the magnifying glass and behind the mathematical symbols , whence far explorers send their messages in codes and symbols that only their fellow-voyagers , and not always they , are able to decipher ; of the philosophers who observe that space in our world has been turned into time , and that debt has been turned into wealth , and that men no longer work to build but to buy , and that nothing is what it seems , and that even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What endangers , what really endangers , the making of the peace is not contempt for the people in the propaganda of our open enemies but this skepticism of our friends  --  and of ourselves . Few Americans , how- , ever realistic and objective , will openly repudiate the proposition Mr. Jefferson advanced , or reject the words in which , at Gettysburg , it took the shape that men remember . Most of us give at least the service of our lips to the American doctrine that the people  --  not the American people only but the People  --  can govern themselves and of right ought to . Our doubts are only reservations . But there are times when reservations are as dangerous as denials , times indeed when they can be more dangerous . When the world demands an act of faith , the reservations which deprive belief of passion , faith of ardor , can be worse than open treason . For they are not spoken and can not be fought . This is our danger as we make the peace : that we wish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we must desire if a peace is to be made ; that we do not sufficiently believe what we naustbelieve if we want a world in which a peace is possible . Many of us , evert of the best of us , are all too ready to condone the questiiining of the people 's right to govern , the open doubts of the capacity of the people , which - , cynical publishers and politicians have expressed in words at home ; and agents of this government hive expressed in deeds abroad . Many of us , though we resent that conduct and those sneers in words , believe in our hearts that the doubts they imply are justified . Many of Us , far too many of us , though we use the words for peace and liberty and freedom , do not believe at bottom , or do not believe enough , that the one essential condition of peace and liberty and freedom can be realized in the actual world . If this is true , and if we fail to make the peace our victory demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our possibilities but of our faith . And such a failure would be very strange . For we of all the nations of the earth , and ours of all the generations that have talked of people 's governments and power , have now most reason to believe . Faith in the people is the deep American faith , and our generation is the generation which has October 28 , 1944 seen more reasons to accept that faith than any which have lived before us . We have the proof before our eyes . We have the proof not in our own people only but in the peoples of France , Greece , Spain , Poland , and other countries  --  the visible and unanswerable proof that the people are capable , in the face of every difficulty and every risk , of governing themselves , of disdplining themselves , of resisting to death and beyond death , that the people are capable of governing themselves in the highest and noblest meaning of the word govern . jean-Paul Sartre has said all this superbly in an article which has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris in Les Lettres Francaises . They did not fight in the daylight , like soldiers  --  in every circumstance they were alone , they were pursued and arrested in their solitude . And it was in their loneliness , in their complete nakedness , that they resisted torture , alone and stripped before their well-shaven , well-fed , and well-dressed executioners , who mocked their pitiful flesh and whose complacent consciences and incredible social power gave every evidence of their being in the right.511 Alone . Without the help of a friendly hand or any encouragement whatsoever . However , in the very depth of this solitude there were the others , all the others , all the comrades of resistance , whom they were defending . One single word sufficient to provoke ten or a hundred new arrests . This total responsibility in total solitude  --  was not this the final revelation of our liberty ? , Thus , in blood and shadows , a republic erected itself , the strongest of republics . Each of its citizens knew what he owed to every other , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood , in the completest loneliness , his historic role and responsibility . Each of them undertook to be himself freely , irremediably against-the oppressors . And in his freedom in choosing himself , he chose the freedom of all . This republic , without institutions , army , or police , made every Frenchman affirm and maintain it against Nazism and at every moment . No one here failed it . How , with the proof of France before us , with the proof of the whole resistance before us , can we doubt , how can we permit ourselves to question , the great declaration of faith and of belief which brought this nation also into being ? How , with this proof before us , 512 with the proof of our own tremendous effort in the war before us , can we fail to silence the doubts , the reservations , which say that a people 's peace can not be made because a people 's government is now no longer possible , or is only possible here , or in a few more fortunate countries , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the face of the mobilization of our own people for the war , in the face of these " republics of silence and of the night , " can we lack an answer to the doubts which tell us that a modern civilization is too complicated and intricate and arcane and vast for the people to understand and govern , or that only the Americans , or only the most exceptional peoples , can govern in such a world ? Can it not be answered to these doubters , whether in ourselves , or beside us in the streets , or elsewhere , that the peoples of many nations have accomplished in the dark , and in the dread of death , and naked , what we say can not be done ? Can it not be answered that men and women who have conquered their own fears , and fought a revolution with their empty hands , and nourished a republic in their nakedness and silence , have ' proved that men can understand more complicated problems than the bankers ever thought of , and master mysteries no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . It is not easy now , for faith is an action in our generation as it has not been for centuries . More are hated for belief than for their deeds , and more are punished for it  --  many ways of punishment . Nevertheless , if one thing in this terrible time is certain it is this  --  that only an act of faith can win this war , can win the issue that this war was fought for . If we can not find again the faith in the people which moved the founders of this republic , if we can not capture the new-found faith in themselves which upheld the peoples of Europe , the war our arms will win will not be won beyond the ranges of our guns or the enlistment of our armies . But if we can read our own past and believe it , if we can read the present of the men of Europe and believe it , the war Will be won in places where no gun could ever strike , and still be won long after the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
