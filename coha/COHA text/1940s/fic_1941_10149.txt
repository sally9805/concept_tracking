called the White Owl . When this chief was a boy he had shot down a great bear . Then he had killed a lot of men in some battle . Several years later , when he was only nineteen he had been chosen to sail across the water in a great boat with other chiefs to talk with the White Father . And the White Father had taken him by the hand and drawn the briars from his feet . This same chief , older now but still strong , sat in the councils of his nation . He was a beloved man . Among all the Cherokees there was no chief greater than Atta Kulla Kulla . " Rion had not known till then that the speech was about Atta Kulla Kulla . He looked over at him quickly . The old man 's head was thrown back , the eyes almost closed , the lips parted . As Rion watched , the chief 's nostrils flickered . His black eves opened wide . They looked enormous in the yellow face and t hey glistened as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the vigorous strokes of a bumblebee 's legs . " Robertson knows how t o tickle him , all right , " he thought . Robertson was bending over to unfasten the sack when the young chief suddenly began speaking . Robertson , still bending over , raised his head . " What does he say ? " he asked sharply . Vann seemed on the point of laughing . " I lc says they better go look at this land before they hand it over to you , " he reported . Robertson looked over at the Carpenter . The old chief 's eyes were again slits under half-fallen lids ; the whole face seemed to have shrunk . A moment ago he had cast his shirt aside and had been sitting with his body exposed to the warm sun but now he drew his shirt on and rose . Vann got up too . " Seeing as the Canoe wants it we better go look at the land , " he told Robertson . Robertson made a gesture towards the handle on the ground . Rion picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young chief whom Vann had called the Canoe ' followed them , and Rion and Frank and the linguister carte after . When they got to the foot of the bluff Rion looked back for the other Indians . They had disappeared . Rion walked on beside the linguister . The young chief was just in front of them . He was over six feet tall and broad for an Indian , but he stepped as light as a woman . No , he moved like a ' coon , thatp20Isame sidewise gait that Rion had often found himself comparing to the swaying of a branch . It came from putting one foot down in the track that the other foot had just made . Rion gazed at the naked back , finding a fascination in contemplatingflesh so unlike his own . He jerked his thumb towards the Indian . " What did you say his name was ? " " Tsu-gun-sini . Means Dragging Canoe . " " Dragon Canoe ? " Rion asked . The man shook his head . " Like you drag a canoe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's chief of a big island down in the Tellico river . He 's the old chief 's son . " Frank came up on the linguistcr 's other side . " How long have you lived with these Indians ? " he asked . The man turned his head and gave him a sharp glance . " I do n't , so to speak , live with them . I got business in the Nation so I been staying there ' tending to it . I was at Chota all this winter but before that I was at Tellico . " " Are there many other white men at ( ; hot a ? " Frank asked . " Well , there 's my partner , Dick Pearis and Isaac Fallin and Jarrot Williams . They come in pretty regular . And there 's Captain Gist . He 's there representing the governor . " " I should like to learn the language , " Frank said thoughtfully . " How long did it take you to learn it ? " " I could n't rightly say . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of a sudden it kind of makes sense to you , and the first thing you know you 're linguisting . I been linguisting for the Carpenter for a good while now . " " What makes you call him the Carpenter ' ? " Rion said . " It 's because he can join a treaty up so neat , like you notch logs for a house . I forget who it was gave hint that name . He likes you to call him by it . " They had come through the river bottom and were walking up through the grove of sugar trees . The Carpenter stopped and sat down on a log near the spring . Robertson sat down beside him . The young bucks whom Rion had last seen at the fort suddenly appeared from the side of the ridge and took up their stand behind the Carpenter'slog . As they crossed the open space in front of the log , Rion noticed that they all had the same gait that he had noticed in the Canoe.  | " Do n't they move like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hear him . He was watching the Canoe . The Canoe had not stopped where the others did . He had gone on straight ahead to the spring . He stopped for a second near a pile of stones , then dived into the bushes . In a few minutes he came out , carrying in his hand a rock the size of a brick bat . He threw it down on the pile and joined the others . The Carpenter had been talking to the linguister but his eyes were on his son . He got up at once , searched until he found a sizable rock , then threw it on the pile . The young bucks also set off on a hunt for rocks until every Indian there had thrown one on the pile . Vann said something to the Canoe , then translated his reply : " He says that a brave warrior is buried there . Ile has forgotten his name but he says that he was a brave man . That 's the way they do , " he added . " Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put another rock on his grave . Makes a nice little tombstone in time . " The Carpenter had taken up a stick and was drawing a map on the ground . It had a little the shape of a bat flying with out-stretched wings . The head would be the spring here , the left wing the river bottom and that other wing the land across the river that Rion had promised to take up for Jacob . Rion wondered how much would be included in the whole tract . Six or seven hundred acres , Robertson calculated , if you counted Jacob 's land in too . It was a pretty little valley , all right . The more he saw of it the better he liked it . Robertsonwas talking again . If the Cherokees wanted to give their white brothers this land to sit down on for a while , the white brothers would be glad and would promise to keep peace always . In return they wished to give their brothers , the Cherokees , the presents they had brought across the mountains . The thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of the finest dye and new . The Carpenter was not listening to Robertson . He was staring at his son . The Dragging Canoe had come up and was standing looking down on the map . His arms were folded . His broad , pitted face was sunk on his chest . He raised his head suddenly and spoke . " What does he say ? " Robertson asked eagerly . " He says it 's not the land , it 's the trees . This is a holy place , he says . " I The Carpenter rose from his log and was speaking . Rion had the feeling that the man would like to be taller than he was . His thinp203frame was held as taut as a bowstring . His chin was elevated . He spoke rapidly with nervous gestures , looking past his son . When he stopped Vann said : " Atta Kulla Kulla is now an old man but he has been in the council forty winters and he has been head man for over forty winters . He never heard before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vann again translated : " The Canoe says that he came this way many years ago , when he was a boy , with Old Hop  --  that 's their emperor . I lc says that Old Hop made him throw a rock on that grave there and told him that this was a holy place . Old Hop said he did not know why it was holy but that when he was a boy they always visited this grove when they came to the Long Island . " The Carpenter sat down again . he sat for a few minutes , his eyes bent on the ground . When he finally spoke it was in a gentle , almost sweet voice . The look as if he might he laughing at you all the time came over Vann 's face as he translated . " I Ic says that he is an old man and has sat in council for over fifty years but he says that times have changed . It used to be that it was the old men who knew which ways were right and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old . He says that times have changed . " There was a long silence . Dragging Canoe kept his eyes on the ground and did not answer . Finally Vann said to Robertson , " You better go ahead . " Robertson untied the sack and laid the hatchets out on the red stroud cloth . The Canoe did not pay any attention to the goods but the other young Indians came up and looked at them and the Carpenterpicked up several of the hatchets and hefted them in his hand . The trade seemed to be over . Robertson was getting out the sheet of paper on which Frank had drawn up the lease . He took from his pocket the quill and the flask of ink he had made last night from oak gall . He was motioning to Rion . Rion stepped forward and signed his name . Frank signed his . Then Vann took the quill and after he was through handed it to the Carpenter , who made his mark . When the Carpenter had made his mark , he handed the quill back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Canoe came forward and made his mark like the others . And now Robertson was signing , last of all . Rion drew his breath in sharply and looked at Frank . It was over.  | For a time there it had looked as if there might be a hitch but things had gone off all right after all . The land was his , to sit down on as they said , as long as he pleased . Robertson was telling Vann that they could not stay the night with their Cherokee brothers . They had promised Amos Eaton to come to his cabin this night . By this time he would be waiting for them up there on the brow . There was the arm-shaking all over again and they were off up the ridge . Nobody had spoken except for one quick whisper from Frank to Robertson . " I 'm glad you got us away before they changed their minds . " They climbed on up the ridge . When they were halfway up Rion looked back . He saw something flash through the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he heard a light chatter of voices , very different from the tones he had heard while he was with the Indians . The chatter went on . A wisp of smoke was rising . " I believe those devils are going to camp there the night , " he said . " Camp right there on my land . "  |p205RION  AND FRANK AND ROBERTSON got back to Doe creek by sundownon Wednesday . The next morning the Outlaw party started up the Watauga . They had to camp on the way one night and reached the creek that Rion had named Falls early the next morning . They stood on the left bank of the river and looked across . The Holston was narrowerthan the Yadkin and flowed faster . There were deep pools but they always ended in white water . The water in these pools was colored green by the reflection of the leaves . Even the spray of the falls seemed tinged with green . Rion turned his eyes and looked up the river . " She falls pretty fast after she leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the opposite bank . Willows fringed the river but there were giant sycamoresmingled with them . Beyond the sycamores he could see the sleek grey trunks of the beeches that covered all the bottom . A little farther on , he knew , the river took a great bend  --  this bottom land was enclosed on three sides by water . " Where 's my land ? " Jacob was asking . Rion pointed to the land on the other side of Falls creek . " It lays about the same as this bottom , " he said , " except there ai n't any big spring on it . But if you build your house up towards the ridge you 'll be nigh as close to the spring as we arc . " Jacob was looking at the place where the creek flowed into the river . " I may not build up that way . I may build me right here where the creek flows in . That high spot there 'd do for a mill site . Plenty flow to turn the wheel . " Rion looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was ideal for a mill site . He wondered why he had not thought of that himself . " There ai n't anything wrong with the other bank , " he said quickly . " I may put up a mill myself . " Frank laughed . " You both better get across the river first . " They went up the river for some distance but found no place shallower than the place where they had first stopped . Rion stepped in there and found that except for a few holes it was never more than waist deep . " I reckon it 's as good a ford as we 'll find , " he told them . He and Frank drove the horses across and then came back and helped the women with their bundles . As they started up through the bottom , Rion looked back over his shoulder at the tumbling water . " Ai n't it funny ? Here I was living on a ford on the Yadkin and now I come all the way through the wilderness and found me another ford . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on down to the spring and drank the cold water where it bubbled up between the sycamore roots . They stood looking back into the grove . " That place there on the rise , " Cassy said , " that 'd be a good place for the house . " " It 's what I thought , " Rion said . " It 's what I thought first day I come here . " Rion and Cassy went on ahead of the others back up the rise . Down in the ravine where the trees were sparser a little light broke through but up here it was all shade . They threw their heads back and looked up into dense layers of green that were unbroken except where a stray shaft of sunlight would fringe the edge of some leaf . " It 'll take a sight of clearing , " Rion said . Cassy still had her head back , gazing . " When I was little I used to look up into the sugar tree leaves and I 'd think it was like the ocean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rion said . " They do n't let the light through . " She had left him and was walking towards the ashes of the campfires . It was the remains of two fires : the Indians had made their fire on top of the one he and Frank had made . She had dropped her bundle and was stepping lightly around an imaginary rectangle . " The house could go in here . . . . All these sugar trees , " she raised her finger and counted , " three , four , six , eight , all these sugar trees they 'd have to go , but that big shellbark hickory , you could leave it stand-ing . " " Yes , " Rion said , " it 'd be handy , having a shellbark right at your door . " " Front door , " she said , " The house would face this way . " " South , " he said mechanically . " It 'll face a little southwest . " He looked about him as he spoke . The dense shade suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were gone and in their place rose four walls , hewn logs , not white but already weathered , one window , maybe two , and a shingle roof . He might even build a lean-to ... . He set his rifle against a tree , turned back to Gal who had come up and was standing patiently behind him , unstrapped the pack and flung it to the ground . " Here , " he said to Gassy , " you and Mrs. Wagnerfinish unloading and drive them horses towards the bottom . Ai n't no use to hobble them . When you git there salt ' em a little and let ' em go . " He took his heavy axe from the pack , then got Frank 's from the other pack and took it over to hint . " Come on , " he said , " we might as well start on them trees now . " The three met ; walked down towards the river . Jacob would have stopped at the foot of the slope but Rion went on farther . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that first . " " The varmints 'll eat your crop if you get that far from the house , " Jacob told him . " No , they wo n't . I 'll have me a close fence up time this crop is out of the ground . " " ' Tai n't much use to plant corn now , " Jacob said . " It ai n't going to have time to make . " " We might have a late fall , " Rion said , " and if we do n't we 'll get ro's'n ears and fodder . " They were in the bottom now . He walked about looking at the trees and stopped before a tall , slender white oak . " Let 's start on this one , " he said and heaved his axe back and set it quivering in the oak 's side . After a half hour 's chopping it fell with a crash , as perfect a house log as you 'd find anywhere in thick woods but with its heart still green . They stood eyeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just right , " Frank said . " See , she brought that beech down with her . " Jacob took his axe and stepped in among the boughs . " I 'll just cut off these limbs , " he said . Frank and Rion found another oak and set to work on it . When it was ready to fall it balanced on a thin white strip no larger around than a man 's leg . Frank stepped back but Rion delivered one more blow from his side . It was one blow too many . The white strip buckled , the trunk twisted sidewise and fell on top of the newlyp208fallen tree . Jacob clapped his hands to his ears and Frank jumped as if he thought he might be standing in the wrong place . Then he laughed . " There go the timbers for your house . " Jacob went up and examined the two trunks at the place where they had collided . " It ai n't hurt none . Just a little place dented here where she hit . I 'd go on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " No , I ai n't going to put her in my house . She may not be strained but I 'd be worrying all the time for fear she was . I ai n't going to put her in my house . " They cut down five more oaks , then set to work on the beeches . Rion looked about him from time to time calculating how much ground they had covered . A quarter acre at least he thought . At noon Cassy came down with a bucket full of water and the big skillet full of turkey stew . With her came Amos Eaton . He had heard the trees falling , he said , and knew that the clearing must have started . He brought with him wrapped in a piece of old cloth a handful of pumpkin and melon seeds and he was leading one of Chloe 's pups . Rion thanked him . " We 'll put us a truck patch in the middle of the corn , " he said . He watched Amos fasten the young hound to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . Amos gave Cassy a sly glance . " I told you I 'd match ever ' child you put up , " he said . " He ai n't going to stay , " Mrs. Wagner said . " It 's too close . He 'll be running home . " " I 'll give him a bait of venison tonight , " Rion said . " And I 'll take him out one of these days soon . " Frank looked at the dog thoughtfully . " You 'd better call him Sirius . " Rion shook his head . " That do n't call so well . . . . Where 'd you get that name ? " " Sirius was the name of Orion 's hound . " " Sir'us , " Rion said . " Well , I better call him that then . Here , Sir'us , " and he snapped his fingers at the hound . Eaton squatted on the ground and watched them for a while . When he left he promised to bring his wife with him next time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank put down his axe ,  |p209stood  back , and wiped his forehead on his sleeve . " I 'm through for the day , " he said . Jacob got up from the stump where he had been resting . " Rion , it 'll be dark pretty soon . You better quit too . " Rion looked up . Between him and the other two lay a great mass of fallen trees . Many trunks had fallen across each other . Here and there an arm thrust up wildly out of a sea of leaves . He gazed into the branches of a great ash and was amazed to find its pointed leaves as fresh , as green as if they still inhabited the upper air . " It 's like they do n't know they 're down , " he thought . He let his eyes rove over the green . 1 le had cut out nearly an acre of trees . Under that great mass of writhen boughs lay his field . He looked into the forest . Here beside his field more trunks went up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another field was there waiting for him to uncover it . He could do it with another day 's work , if the other two men would stay with him . Jacob called again . " Come on . It 'll be ( lark here in a minute . You 'll cut yourself if you try to chop in the dark . " A moment ago Rion had flung his axe from him when he had finishedfelling a tree . He stooped and picked it up , and felt the pull of the muscles across the small of his back and realized that this was the hardest day 's work he had done in many a day . " You can talk all you want to about driving a pack train , " he thought , " but ai n't anything like a day 's chopping to twist a man 's insides . No wonder old Jacob 's been perched on a stump half the day . " He walked around the side of the fallen trees and caught up with Frank and Jacob . They walked slowly towards the camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures of the two women moving above it . They had unpacked everything and had the camp neatly arranged . Mrs. Wagner 's pots and pans were set out on one end of the big down log where the old chief had sat . She had contrived to bring a good many things with her : I lc noticed a pewter pitcher and there were four pewter plates set out on the end of the log , for all the world like a table . IIc set his rifle and axe against a tree and walked over and lifted one of the plates . " I did n't know you had these with you . " The old woman looked up from the stew she was stirring . " I was n't going to bring ' em out on the trip . If I had you 'd a made me throw ' em away . "  |p2I0She  took the skillet from the fire and dished out the stew . They took up their plates and began eating . Gassy looked at a blue platter . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a lot of other things I 'd rather have . " " If I 'd only brought some kind of a bowl , " Mrs. Wagner said . " I ai n't got any bowl big enough to mix bread in . " Rion threw back his head and laughed . " You ai n't got any flour , you ai n't got any meal and here you are worrying about a bowl to mix ' cm in ! " " This land would n't bring good wheat , " Jacob said . " Too loamy . " " Well , it 'll bring corn till the world looks level , " Rion said . " Amos Eaton , he got a hundred bushel off that acre of his up there on the ridge . " The stew was all gone . Gassy had taken the big skillet up and was scouring it with sand from the ravine . She stayed her hand and straightened up . " Amos Eaton says he 'll have snap beans inside of two weeks . " She gazed past them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 'll divide with us , " Rion said . " He 's a cross-grained fellow but he 's free-handed . He 'll divide with us . " She turned around and looked at him , fixedly and yet as if she did not see him . Her eyes were a little dilated and shone . There was fierceness in their shine . You got that look sometimes from a beast when it knew its hour was come but it was strange to see it in the eyes of a woman . He noticed what he had not really noticed until now  --  how thin her face was . A little cup was sunk in each cheek and the skin over her brow was drawn so tight that it shone . He thought of the child that was making . " It ai n't her , " he thought , " it 's the baby crying out in her . It 's afraid it ai n't going to get enough to eat . " He cursed the slowness of the seasons . The middle of June and most if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the man to make much of a garden . He would divide with them what he had but it would be just a few messes of snaps . Corn would not be in silk before August . Till then she 'd have to get along without bread or greens . But how could she ? She was eating less every day , had got so now she could hardly touch game . . . . He could not sit still . He took his axe and walking a little way from the fire felled a sizable tree , and then cut down half a dozen saplings . There was a big down log near by . He rolled it up to thep2IIfire , cleared out the space in front of it , then set up his cross-pole and slanted the other poles from it to the log . He got the two old buffalo robes and some quilts from the packs and placed them over the slantingpoles with rocks laid at the edges to keep them down . " Now , " he said to the woman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house you 'll have till the land is cleared . " Mrs. Wagner was pleased . " Jacob , go cut me some boughs , " she said , " I 'll make my bed right up against that log . " The men went out and cut some boughs . The two married couples made their beds inside the tent but Frank said he would sleep outside . Mrs. Wagner and Jacob crawled in and Cassy followed them in a few minutes . Rion still sat with Frank beside the fire . He was tired and at the same time he felt exhilarated , as if his muscles were reluctant to stop working . He got his axe and hunted around till he found a buckeyetree and cut it down . He chopped out a big chunk and brought it to the fire and whittled on it with his knife until he had fashioned it into a bowl . He set it down , looked at it a moment , then spoke to Mrs. Wagner asleep now in the tent : " There ! You got you a bread bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p212WHEN  RION got up the next morning nobody was stirring . He remembered a long , shallow stretch of water that they had passedjust before the creek flowed into the Holston . The bank shelved down to the water gently . He had noticed deer droppings there and the sharp tracks of the little hoofs . It was probably a watering place . The place was at least a mile from the house . he crossed the creek and was on what they were already calling " Jacob 's land . " He had not examined this bottom as carefully as he had examined his own land , and as he went down through the dawning light he looked about him . The bottom lay just as well as his own and seemed to have the same kind of growth but it was not quite as big . That was as it should be . Jacob could not expect to ride over here on another man 's shoulders and come out as well as he did . It was worth something to the old coot to live near a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went down to the river , walked along the bank , and came to the pool he remembered . There was more cover here than there was on the other bank . He crouched down , primed his gun , rested it in the crotch of a willow and waited . It had been quiet enough as he came along but now the birds were starting , all at once , like a crowd of people in church . They were perched in the trees along the bank but every so often one would fly down to bathe in the shallows . Something scarlet flashed past him : a parakeet skimming up from the water to rest on a limb over his head . The woods were full of those little devils . He wished he could capture one for Jocasta . He had known an Indian once had one for a pet . It sat on his shoulder and pecked crumbs from between his lips . A wild thing trusted you a lot to do that . Light was growing everywhere but here in the woods it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was rather a gradual withdrawing of darkness . There was little wind but the mist on the river was lifting , swirling upward slowly as he had seen clouds lifting once from a mountain top.  |p213There  was a rustle in the forest that might have been made by a dry twig falling . Another of those slight rustles and then he saw the delicate forms crowding through the mist : a buck and two does . The buck came first . He stepped out into the middle of the pool and stood still , his head up . The does on either side of him lowered their heads and drank . While they drank the buck turned his head to the left and brought his muzzle slowly down along the edge of the gentle wind . Rion waited until the muzzle had swung almost full circle and was pointed downstream . Then he fired . The buck dropped in his tracks , falling sidewise against one of the does . She whirled and was up the bank almost as fast as the other one . Their tails blazed white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willows and stooped over the buck . He was already dead , full grown , with a coat as red as madder and the burr of his antlers just formed . Rion cut his head off and let it float downstream , doused the bleeding neck in the water for several minutes , then dragged the carcass to the bank , heaved it over his shoulders and set off for the camp . Up at the camp they were stirring . Rion cut the meat out and Mrs. Wagner broiled some collops for breakfast . " Makes a change from turkey , " she said and tried to make Cassy cat one . But Cassy refused and said that she would boil herself some milkweed she had found . " I ca n't eat deer meat this early in the morning , " she said . When the men had finished eating they took their axes and went to the bottom . They worked all morning and most of the afternoon . Then , just as the sun 's rays were beginning to slant they prepared to burn the acre off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to save . Rion and Frank helped hint roll these logs to a safe distance , then heaped the limbs and brush into a big pile in the middle of the clearing and raked the ground about the pile free from twigs for ten or fifteen feet on every side . The women had come down to see the sight . The air was full of the sweet smell of fading leaves . Mrs. Wagner shook her head when she saw the fallen boughs rearing halfway to the tops of the trees left standing . " How in the Name you ever going to get all that green wood to burn ? " Rion came up , dragging some small pine trees that he had cut on the ridge . He put several of them at the side of the mound and dropped shellbark in amongst them . The other pines he laid end top214end all the way around the base of the heap , then set fire to the shellbark . It kindled at once . The light wood caught and the small pine trees . The blaze spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a thin garland of fire . Cassy stood beside Rion . She drew her breath in as the odor of burning resin filled the air . " Do n't it smell good ? " " Wait till the hickory starts burning , " Rion said . " Ai n't nothing smells as good as burning hickory . " He left her and walked to the other side of the mound . The pines were nearly all burned now but the fire had started in only a few places . He might have to cut more pines and start it all over again . He rounded the circle and came back to where Gassy was still standing . A shellbark hickory had caught and the fire was going in at last . The tree , as large as any they had cut clown , was not sound enough for timber so they had not lopped its branches off . It lay slanting , its trunk protruding from the bast of the pile , its branches stretching almost to the top . The flames had started on the loose curls of bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree flamed , then the flames died suddenly : the red , glowing skeleton was suspended there in the heart of the heap . There was a rush of wind from the south . The skeleton crumbled into embers which whirled and fell smoldering on the green leaves . Smoke arose in great plumes and drifted upwards among the trees still left standing . The women moved back , coughing , but Rion stayed where he was watching the flames struggle with the smoke . Other hickories had caught from that shower of sparks . Here and there a flame was creepingalong the outside of the mound . But some of the trees were sullen and slow to burn . When the flames reached a buckeye they stopped and had to go around some other way . But they kept mounting . A bed of burning coals was forming in the middle . It grew all the time as the embers dropped down on it . Suddenly a great wall of flame rose from that glowing bed and raced upward . It towered above the pile and licked at the boughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the trees still left standing . The whole pile crackled . The heat was now so fierce that it burned his face . But Rion did not move . He stood rubbing his hands as if their motion could hasten the burning . If he could only use fire to clear all his land ! Set it burning as this great flame was now burning and consume the forest instead of fellingeach tree laboriously by hand . They were calling him from the slope . He turned away into thep215cooler air . As he went he put his hand up to his face . The flesh felt hot even to his calloused fingers . " Little more and I 'd a burnt myself , " he muttered . At the camp Cassy was waiting for him , and they went down to the spring . Rion was already stripped to a breech clout . He waded downstream till he found a little falls and sat there at the foot of the ledge , letting the water foam up over his shoulders and throwing it on his face and chest until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstream to where Gassy was sitting on the cairn of stones . She was looking off up the ridge . He followed the direction of her eyes . A figure was moving off through the pines . He stooped over quickly and picked up his rifle . Gassy laughed . " It ai n't anybody but Jane Eaton . She 's been around here all day . " " She come to visit ? " She laughed again . " She came to visit but she do n't dare . She wo n't come nearer than this and if we holler at her she runs off . " He gazed after the woman . " She 's left something , " he said . " Ai n't that something setting up there on the rock ? " He ascended the ridge a little way and found , sitting on a flat rock beside the path that was already beginning to he worn , an open piggin full of buttermilk . He carried it back to Gassy . " She 's brought you some buttermilk , " he said . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Buttermilk , " she said in a whisper . " You take a drink , " he said and tilted the vessel before her . She put her head down and drank , as he had seen thirsty horses drink , in one long , powerful gulp , then she raised her head and stepped back a little . " I better not drink it all up . The others ought to have some . " " They do n't crave it like you do , " he said , continuing to hold the vessel up to her . She lowered her lips to it and drank again , not quite as much this time , and then for a while she was raising her head and lowering it , taking little sips , holding the milk in her mouth sometimes , as if she wanted to get all the taste she could out of it . Finally she stopped drinking and just stood there , looking down at what was left . " Did it taste good ? " he asked . She smiled at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads of milks . " I have n't ever had anything as good in my whole life . " PART ? HMIRE.NPART " Such were the first inhabitants of Kentucky and Tennessee , of whom there are now remaining but very few . It was they who began to clear those fertile countries , and wrested them from the savages who ferociously disputed their right ; it was they , in short , who made themselves masters of the possessions , after five or six years bloody war : but the long habit of a wandering and idle life has prevented their enjoying the fruits of their labours . . . . " FRANCOIS ANDRI ; 11 ICI 1AUXp219AFTER ARCHY had come up on the other side of the creek and had seen the buffalo sign , he walked about over the trampled ground , searching for a lick . There was no lick , no salt cropping out anywhere but they evidently came here often ; there was one place where you could tell they had been wallowing . He left the creek and walked up over the rise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hickory . The trunks had great , peeled places where the buffalo had been rubbing themselves . You could see the tracks plain , even up here where the ground was not so moist . The tracks were fresh , the particles of earth still glistening where they had been thrown up by the big cowhoofs . He walked on to the end of the grove . " 1'hc prairie began . There was an opening in the tall grass before hint , wide at first , then narrowingto what looked like a giant rabbit run : the buffalo street . He 'd heard the old folks tell about them and now here he was standing on one . He loaded his rifle and set the trigger , then , half crouching , crept down the green alley . When he had gone a little way he stopped and , raising his head level with the grass , strained his eyes to look over the prairie . In these few minutes it had grown darker , and the ground was more broken on this side of the creek , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he saw dottingthe prairie might be only clumps of wild plum . He waited , motionless , holding his breath . The dark blot nearest him split , into two moving forms . One headed north , slowly . The other was comingthis way . He stood there cursing the failing light and watching the dark back slide through the grass . He would have to move soon or the beast would graze right over him . And there were others grazing the same way ; he would have to move . But that might stampede the herd . He took two steps backward as softly as he could and in that moment the wind changed . The nearest buffalo caught his scent and stopped grazing . His great , woolly head rose , hung there , black against the sky . Archy fired , aiming for the shoulder . There was a220 GREEN CENTURIESp220bellow . Hoofs struck the earth . Archy dove to the side . The grasses whistled as the beast rushed past him and then there was no sound : the beast had stopped and was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to his feet and he knew that it was taking his scent straight to the herd . They were making for the woods , the lot of them , with a noise like the pounding of a thousand flails on a threshing floor . The wounded beast heard them , too , and was off , coughing . Archy , listening , thought that the bullet must have lodged in the lungs . In that case the buffalo might choke on the blood and drop soon . There was still a chance , if he could trail him a little way . He re-loaded and started running . He struck the street and kept to it , thinking he might make better time that way . The herd had disappeared into the woods but he could still hear the hoofs in the distance , and now out here on the prairie he heard a sound that might come from the wounded buffalo . He had stopped to listen , fearing that the beast might already have dropped and he gone past him when the sound came again , a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her calf a long time . He stepped forward cautiously . The beast might be down but he could get up again : there was no use taking chances . The grasses in front of him whispered . A form rose out of the tall grass . A man . He thrust the muzzle of his musket into Archy 's belly and said somethingArchy could not understand . Archy stepped back quickly . The muzzle followed him . With his left hand the man took Archy 's gun away from him , then he laughed and spoke again , seeming to ask a question in a kind of talk Archy had never heard before . The steel ring bit into Archy 's stomach . He heard himself speaking : " All right ... All right ! " and then in a voice that sounded high and angry , " You better watch out . My folks 'll be along in a minute . " The man lowered his musket and almost in the same motion leaned forward and laid his hand on Archy 's shoulder , pressing him into step beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his head and looked back . Dusk had settled over the prairie but there in the grove a thin point of fire flickered . The folks had come up and were camped for the night . He flung his arm up , catching the Indian across the face , then dodged and made off through the grass . The blood roared in hisp22Iears . His legs moved faster than they had ever moved before in his life . His arms beat the air and he fancied as each arm shot out that it clutched and thrust behind him part of the prairie . He had been for some minutes in this delicious , headlong flight when he tripped in a noosed vine and went down . He was halfway to his feet when suddenly his whole body was cloven by fire . He went down again , face forward in the grass . The fire licked over him , then it was gone , all but one sharp flame . That burned in his shoulder . He put his hand up and drew it away wet with blood and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and sharp from his shoulder . The flame was dying . His body that had been so taut went limp . He rolled over on his side , feeling drowsy . But something was touching his bare leg . He opened his eyes . The Indian was bending over him . He drew the hatchet from the boy 's shoulder and pulled him to his feet . He put his arm around him and drew him forward swiftly over the prairie . He said something , then looked behind him to where the fire burned in the grove and said the same thing again , and went forward even faster . They went through deep woods for a long time . Finally they saw a light shining through the trees . As they drew near it , the Indian began to shout and drew Archy forward on the run . There were half a dozen Indians squatting around the fire . When Archy 's Indian started shouting they stood up . The Indian dragged Archy into the circle of the firelight and the ot her Indians crowded around the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen a white man before . One of them felt his thin arms , then passed his hand wonderingly over his hair which he had had Mrs. Wagner clip short for coolness only that morning . Another Indian touched the edge of his wound and made a soft , mournful sound . Finally his captor made the others stand back and led him over and sat him down with his back against a tree , then passed a buckskin thong about his body . His wound  --  it was in the fleshy part of his shoulder  --  was still bleeding . He was beginning to feel faint . He closed his eyes , not caring , now that they had tied him up , what happened . After a while he felt something hard and hot pressing against his lips and opened his eyes . A pannikin fresh from the fire was being held up to him . The liquid in it was not rum or brandy but blood : the buffalo 's blood . He sickened at the odor and turned his headp222aside but the Indian kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian  --  it was his captor  --  then knelt down beside him and bound a poultice of wet leaves on his shoulder . The wound had begun to ache . The cool , wet leaves soothed it a little . The Indian got up from where he had been squatting and looked down at Archy . He was a young Indian , not much older than Archy himself , though better muscled . He had on nothing but a breech clout . His head was shaved or plucked except for the one long black lock of hair that dangled down to the small of his back . He looked at Archy and smiled and pointed . Archy looked where he was pointing and saw two more Indians coming into camp . They had rawhide thongs slung over their shoulders and were bending forward , straining like oxen . The burden bumped up over a root and Archy saw that it was the buffalo cut into quarters . A third Indian suddenly ran up behind them , balancing the buffalo head on his shoulders . He laid it down on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked it up . Suddenly he was crouching , coming towards Archy , holding the great , woolly head up beside his own . He kicked out with one leg and gave the same plaintive low that Archy had heard out on the prairie , at the same time looking at Archy and laughing . Archy made a smile with his stiff lips , and looked away from the dark , bright eyes . The Indian laid the head down and ran and leaped into the air and gave again the cry that he had given when they first came into camp . Some Indians who were kneeling on the other side of the fire , working at something , turned around and smiled over their shoulders at the leaping Indian . Their smiles turned him grave . He stopped his capering and drawing his knife out of its sheath began to help the others cut up the buffalo meat . Archy 's head felt clearer and his wound did not burn so much . He leaned back against the tree and stretched his legs . A big Indian got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , cup-like thing in his hand . He bent over and warmed it in the flames then chipped at it with the point of his knife . Archy 's eyes went to the gap he had made in the circle and he saw what it was they were working over : a dead man . A young , dead Indian . He lay on a litter of boughs , his feet pointing up straight and his handsp223folded on his chest . He was naked except for his flap , and his body was sleek with grease up to the peak of his scalp . His face was painted red . A pipe was laid on his breast . A quiver full of arrows was by his side . There was a hole in his left breast just under the tittie . The place around it was dark under the grease as if much blood had run there . The big Indian went over to the corpse . He flaked a little paint from the stone cup into his palm , then with the tip of a feather he outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groove in the upper lip . He stood a moment , looking down at the dead man , then he gave a cry so low and so mournful that it sent a chill down Archy 's spine . He sat down at the foot of the litter , his arms folded , his head sunk on his breast . The other Indians moved slowly away from the corpse and Archy saw , leaning against a tree not ten feet away front him , a white man bound in the same way that he was . This white man was looking in Archy 's direction but he was not looking at Archy or even at the dead Indian . Ile was looking off through the trees . A young fellow , not more than eighteen or twenty , with a yellow beard covering most of his face . His eyes were grey , rather pale , and had a dead look to them . " I'hcy were fixed on something that was about on a level with Alrchy 's head and a little to the left of him and then suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from tree to tree as if lie were watching something that was going by fast  --  no , as if he himself were out there in his own look , dodging from tree to tree . Archy turned his head to see what the man was watching but there was nothing under the trees . I lc looked back at the man and saw a muscle in the left cheek flicker as if it would leap out of the skin , and then he heard the cry and the mournful Indian was there , leaping at the white man and giving his terrible cry over and over again . The other Indians ran up and held him back and spoke to him in soothing tones ; they led him back to the foot of the bier where he sat down again with his arms folded and his head sunk on his chest . The white man had not moved except to throw his head a little back and he did not speak now , only let out his breath in a long sigh and sent his eyes to dodging through the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , then came back again . He winked and stared and was running his tongue over his lips as if he were about to speak , when two Indians came up and lifted the litter that held the corpse . They walked off through the trees with it , the big Indian nearest the litter and the others following single file . As they went they were singing in melancholy voices . The white man spoke : " Where 'd they get you ? " Archy jerked his thumb over his shoulder . " Out there on the prairie . I was chasing a buffalo and run into ' ern . " The white man 's eyes swung away before Archy had finished . He was watching the Indians . He said : " It was that big fellow 's brother I shot . " " Where 'd they get hold of you ? " Archy asked . " Three days ago , " the man said , " going through that first gap . The others went on . But we was needing meat , so Tom Murphy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were both silent , watching the Indians through the trees . They had filled the grave and now they were marching around it . Three times they made the circuit ; then they scattered into the woods . The grave was there alone for a long time . At last they came back . Each one had a rock in his hand and he stood a little way off and cast it upon the grave . They were coming back through the trees . The white man watched them a minute ; then he said : " Tom Murphy run like a deer ... I would n't a thought it of him . " Archy was silent , watching the Indians approach . They were talking among themselves , all except the big Indian who went off by himself and sat down against a tree . The others were cutting up the buffalo meat . One had part of the hump and was roasting it on a spit and another broiled the heart on the coals . When the meat was done they brought some to Archy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea they gave him . They offered meat and drink to the other white man . He took a morsel of meat in his mouth but spat it out , pointing to his throat . The Indians had finished their meal . They got up . One of them was stamping out the embers . Another was tying up the rest of the hump in an elkskin . They picked up their rifles and seemed ready to start somewhere . Archy 's captor came over , smiling , and untied him and took him by the arm . Two other Indians were getting the white man up . He had evidently been tied up longer than Archyp225had . He stumbled when he got to his feet . One of the Indians had to kneel down and rub his legs before they would hold up under him . The big Indian got up and stood near while this was going on , as if he could not bear to see the white man get so much attention . The white man would not look at him while the others were rubbing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom running that made me fire so quick , " he said , " he run and that got me rattled . " The Indian holding his arm made a sign that they were ready to start . He jerked his eyes away from A Archy 's face . They set off , with the Indians , through the deep woods.  |p226THEY  TRAVELED through the woods for eight days , then one evening they came upon a valley shaped like a bowl and shallow , with a rim of low mountains encircling it on every side . Archy had been feverish from his wound for three days and nights and the Indians stopped to let him rest as soon as they came in sight of this valley . He sat down on a big rock in the pass and stayed there a while , hardly knowing what went on around him until someone touched him on the arm . He looked up . His captor was standing beside him , smiling and pointing down into the valley . The sun had just gone down . It was already hazy here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Archy could see a river winding through the plain , with a smaller river flowing into it . There were stretches of woods all over the valley but there were open spaces , with dark spots in them that looked like houses , and beside these houses were broad patches of bright green . Staring with dull eyes , he knew these for corn fields , and the thought came to him that it was too fair a land to be possessed by savages . He got up without making any answer to the Indian and they went on down the slope . After a while they came to what looked like a town . The Indians stopped when they came in sight of it . The smiling Indian stepped off into the woods and with his hatchet felled a hickory sapling . Out of the heart of it he split a stout withe and then sat down , cross legged , and began bending it into a hoop . The other Indians fell on Archy and the other white man , Grady , and stripped them of their clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned into a yoke such as is put on breachy stock . He held it high and slid it over Archy 's head . Archy felt the cool , wet wood settle on his shoulders and felt the haft strike against his ankle and thought that there was little chance for him to get away from them now . He heard Grady speak : " Why do n't they put one on me ? " " I do n't know , " he said.  |p227Another  Indian came up with two peeled wands . He handed one to Archy and one to Grady and made a sign that they were to wave the wands and sing . Then the Indians drew up in two lines of four each , with Archy and Grady in the middle , and went whooping and yelling into the town . They ran down a lane , between log houses that were wattled with mud , till they came to a big open square . There was a great elm tree in this square and at the end of the square a cabin larger than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yelling louder now that people had come out of the cabins to look at them . Finally they stopped . Archy had tripped on his yoke several times and had been struck once when he stopped yelling for a minute . The clamor died . llc shut his eyes and stood with his head down , not caring , for the moment , whether they hit him or not , wanting only to get his breath hack . When he looked up the square was full of people . Women mostly . No , there was an old , white-headed man and next to him another Indian whose hair was almost as white . He felt a hand on the back of his head . An Indian had come up behind him and was lifting a lock of his hair . I le looked over the heads of the old men , up into the branches of the elm . An elm threwits branches up bolder than any tree in the world . They 'll scalp us now . It 's time to scalp us . He shut his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh . Hold it back ! . . . Hold it back ! . . . Lessie Robinson . Last August , the way home from church . She come up and put her hands on me then turned off into the bushes . White dust makes leaves grey where we are laying . Sudden and hot . . . No matter . Promise never again sin , never sin again , never .. . There was a little tug , the hiss of a blade through hair and the hand was gone . He opened his eyes . The two bent old Indians were still looking at him . There was another man with them , an old , blue- ( wed white man , stark naked like them except for his breech clout . He was looking past Archy , past Grady to where some of the Indians were digging around the roots of the big tree . Archy turned his head and saw them drop the hair they had taken from him and Grady down into the hole . Three or four of them jumped on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Archy 's captor , the smiling Indian , was beating himself on the228 GREEN CENTURIESp228breast and giving again the cry he had given so often coming through the woods . The white man half put out his hand , then drew it back . He said : " My name is Mouncy . Fred Mouncy . I been here in the Nation since the fall of Fort Loudon . " " What nation ? " Grady said . " We been in the woods . We do n't know where we are . " " You in the Overhill Cherokees . The town of Setticoe . " He stood there and looked from one to the other . " Which one of you fellers killed Pumpkin Boy ? " " I shot him , " Grady said . The man had been looking at Grady hard but he took his eyes away quick . The Indians were coming up . He went over and talked to them in their language . They talked back like they were mad . The man said the same thing to them over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian whose brother had been killed broke away and went running around yelling and waving his tomahawk . The man stood a minute , looking around , at the women , at the old men ; then he came back to Archy and Grady . He took hold of Archy 's arm . " You better come with me , " he said . Archy started off with him , but stopped . " Ca n't Grady come too ? " he asked . The old white man shook his head . " We 'll come back and get him in a few minutes . " Archy did not know whether Grady had heard what the man said . He went up to him . " He says we 'll be back in a few min-utes . " Grady was watching an Indian who was squatting on the ground , mixing some black stuff in a stone pot but he turned around and looked at Archy . His eyes were bright and steady . They took in Archy and even took in Mouncy there behind him . " Where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to answer , but Mouncy called out , " Over here , to one of these houses . " Grady turned around again without waiting for the answer . Archy stood there beside him , so close to him that he could feel the heat from his body , could smell his sweat . He put his hand out and touched Grady 's arm and would have said something else , but Gradyp229did not seem to know he was there ; he was watching where the black stuff was being mixed in the stone pot . They went off between two rows of houses . They turned a corner and were out of sight of the big tree and the staring Indians . They passed one old woman smoking a pipe in a doorway , then went on down to the end of the street and stopped before a house . It was like all the others , the doorway small and black . Archy had to bend down to go inside . He straightened up and he felt that somebody had come and taken his head off his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . A big stone pot stood on a bench there by the door and over in the far corner was a low couch covered with skins . Mouncy had him by the arm . " You lay down , " he said . " You lay down over there in the corner . " He helped Archy over to the couch and laid his hand on his forehead . " You got fever , boy , " he , said . He went away . Archy shut his eyes . The couch was higher than it had been when he lay down on it and he himself was lighter . That was because of his head ; it felt like a dried eymling . I le was afraid he would fall off the couch and he put his hand out and clutched at the coarse bear skin . But the hairs came away in his hand and he was sliding . " Mouncy ! " he called . " You said your name was Mouncy ? " The man was back beside him . " You drink this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ai n't no use in feeding you . " Archy opened his eyes suddenly . " Get me those apples up there on that tree . " " I 'll get ' em for you in a minute , " the man said . " You ai n't got no business eating now . You got fever . " He went away . Archy kept his eyes open but he was lying on his back and could not see anything except the ceiling of the hut . It was dark up there but he could see two little men walking like flies on the arched timbers . Their eyes stuck out of their heads like bug 's eyes and were made of phosphorus . They had bows and arrows and the little arrows they shot kept pelting the bearskin . Archy was afraid they would shoot at him and he called to Mouncy to come get them down . " It 's the Thunder Boys , " Mouncy said . " They ai n't going to do no harm . You shut your eyes and go to sleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see the ceiling or anything except over on the other side of the room a grey oval that had something shaped like a man 's head sticking up in the middle of it . Mouncy sat in the doorway and smoked . He spoke aloud in a musing voice : " If there was any of the headmen here they would n't do it . If they had n't all gone to the ball play ... " " Where is the ball play ? " Archy asked in a quiet , natural tone . " It 's at Chota . And you 're here in Setticoc . I wish I war n't . I never liked this town . Do n't never come here when I can help it . ... They brought ' em here because it was in this town it all started . But I reckon if Willenawah was here he 'd let ' em go ahead . He ai n't ever forgot Fort Loudon . " Archy started up . " They going to take us to Fort Loudon ? " " They ca n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I live at Trading Ford , " Archy said . " You can see our house from the river . " " You poor loony ! You ai n't likely to sec it again . Lay down now . Ai n't nobody going to hurt you . " Archy began to cry . " You said you was my friend ! " " I ai n't nobody 's friend . " Archy snivelled into the coarse hair of the skin . The man paid no attention to him but went on talking . " Fred Mouncy . . . His Majesty 's Tenth Essex . I been here in the Nation ever since the fall of Fort Loudon ... " There was a rush of feet outside , a mighty yelling . " They 're taking him to the mound , " the man said softly , then went on talking to himself : " They say I ai n't no live man , say something come and got my soul . And they do n't like it because I do n't take a woman . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my manhood since Fort Loudon . The tenth day after they sieged us I woke up and it was gone . " From some distance off came the beat of a drum . Then one lone voice was singing . Then the drum beat again and then yells , sharp and rhythmical . " They 've started round , " the man said in the same soft tone . The odor of burning wood rose and hung on the May air . The old man got up and walked over to the bed . Archy was lying on hisp231back , his eyes closed . The old man listened to his harsh breathing for a moment and went back to his seat in the doorway . " I come up there behind the parapet . Luke Croft was doing guard . It was the tenth day . The horseflesh was all gone and the cattle . We was down to beans . A quart to divide between three men . The Carpenter , he come in that day and eat with the officers and Captain Demere asked him : What news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the man to ask , that the Indians kept everything from him . . . I went up on the parapet where Luke was doing guard . I said , Luke , I been starved so long I lost my manhood . ' He laughed and said them was n't the parts to worry about and just then them devils rose from the bushes across the river and laughed and held their hands up and said they was sore from scalping and said they had beaten Montgomery back and taken his drums and a horse load of ammunition ... " There was a sudden high scream and then another . The white man shifted his feet and his pipe fell out of his hand , clattering on to a stone . " We hauled our flag down August ninth , " he said , " and paraded the garrison . There was one hundred and eighty men and sixty women and some children . We buried the cannon in the well and some swords and we started out . One hundred and forty miles to Fort Prince George . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empties into Tellico . Oconostota and Judd 's Friend had promised to march with us but they did n't conic . Only Judd 's Friend come into camp late that evening and stayed awhile and then went off to Tellico . " Captain Demere knew they ought to a marched with us . We kept watch all that night . It was just after reveille sounded in the morning . Lieutenant Adamson was getting the orders for the day when they fired on him and the captain from ambush. lie fired back and wounded one of them and then they was all over the camp . They say now there was seven hundred of them . We could n't a done nothing if we 'd tried . But the officers called to surrender ... " The screams kept on all the time now , sharp but running together so that they made a continuous high keening . The man did not seem to hear them . He said : " They scalped the captain there on the field and made him dance a long time and when he give out they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth and they said You want land . You got it now . " They brought me and the others to this town , Setticoe . In the late evening it was and they took us out to the mound . They made us dance with rattles and then they took Luke Croft and put him on the mound and built the fire around him , low so he would n't breathe in the flame . They tied me there and told me it was my turn , after Luke . Luke lasted all night . He would n't holler , so they took him out and put water on his face and gave him drink and rested him , then built the fire up again . I was near and I called to him , Give up , man ! For God 's sake , give up ! ' " He turned his head and looked at me . I ca n't ever forget his eyes , red from the fire . I ' 11 get out , ' he said , ' I ' 11 get out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em open , ' he said and told what he 'd do with the guts after he got them out . " They came up and took him out of the fire . They had gun barrels heated and they stuck ' em up him . He hollered then . I do n't know whether he was dead when they cut his arms and legs off .. . They did n't burn me . A runner come from Oconostota , saying there was peace . . . " The moaning had died long ago . There had been for a while a yelling and singing from the Indians but that had died too and the whole air was still . Mouncy stopped talking , suddenly , as if he were just then hearing his own voice . He got up and going over to the bed stood for several minutes beside the sleeping boy . He came back and stood in the doorway . " Ai n't it quiet ? " he said.  |p233THE  DARK LANTHORN stood in her small field and looked over her rows of beans . The plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green leaves . Three times since they had been planted she had stirred the earth in every hill and yesterday she had given the corn the same working . There was nothing to do now for several days . She laid her hoe against the fence post and walked down the rows . When she came to where the small corn was planted she pulled a stalk towards her and stripped the husks back : the grains were the size of an eight-month baby 's toot-h . She smoothed the husks back over the gleaming ear and let the stalk swing away from her . As she stepped over the two suspended hickory wither that formed her fence she glanced up over her head . Between the droopingplumes of the hemlock a patch of sky was visible , blue except for the milk-pale disc of the new moon . She raised her wrinkled right hand in an old gesture . " I greet thee , Father of my Mother . When it is like this again we will still be seeing each other . " She murmured the words under her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moon , she thought that the next time the pale disc hung there her corn would be in the milk , ready for roasting . She followed the path to the summer house . Inside she stopped before a tall earthen jar and dipped up a gourd full of sour corn gruel . As she did so she laid her palm against the side of the jar , feelingwith pleasure the moisture that had gathered there . She had been hoeing in the field for several hours , in the heat of the day , and she was sweating all over . She took another drink of the gruel , relishing its coolness as much as its sharp , agreeable flavor , then turned away to a chest in the far corner . She lifted the lid and took out half a dozen small earthenware pots on a big tray . She crossed the room , going slowly , looking about her as if it had been some other woman 's house . A little light came in through the slits in the wall which her husband had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays on a white-washed floor , on white stools and on walls that had been white-washed as high as the Lanthorn 's thin old arms would reach . The pot of manly clay and the twig brush still stood there at the side of the hearth but she would not need them again , until , in the time of the green-eared moon she would make her hearth ready for the new fire . Balancing her tray of pots she went out through the narrow doorway . Everything inside the summer house was in order  --  even the reed couches showed white legs under their coverings of skins  --  and she still had many hours of daylight left . She went swiftly towards the corner of the yard where her carpet hung in its wooden frame . She had gathered the hemp last summer in the open lands and all during the fall of the leaf she had worked , pulling it , steeping it , beating it and finally in the dark winter house spinning it off the distaff . Others , lying on the couches , would ask why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no answer except that she wanted to have her carpet ready for the frame by the time the dogwood was white . The dogwood and the redbud , too , were gone from the woods , but she had worked all the time they bloomed , pulling her thread through with the long cane needle until now her carpet hung in the frame , finished to the last thread , ready for the painting . She set the tray of pots down on the ground ; then for a few minutesshe walked back and forth before the frame , measuring with her eye the suspended tawny square , trying to decide with what figures she would paint it . A noise made her turn her head . A few feet away her foster-son the Bear Killer , slept , leaning against a tree . He was not comfortable . His head would jerk to the side and he would slide from the tree trunk . When this happened he did not wake up but , keeping his eyes shut would rise to the same position again . The Lanthorn smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour against a tree trunk would not go far on the warpath . She took a sharpened stick and , squatting , drew on the hard baked earth the outline of her carpet , then made rough sketches of the figures with which she would adorn it . In one corner a wolf , for her husband 's clan . In the opposite corner her own ancestor , the deer . In the lower left-hand corner a cedar tree , in the lower right-hand corner a great dogwood blossom because the carpet had been woven in the time that the dogwood was in bloom . In the middle she would depict some event in the life of her husband , the great peace chief ,  |p235Atta  Kulla Kulla . As always when she thought of that small , wrinkled old man , her heart grew warm . She wondered how she should show him , whether on the hunt , on the warpath , or in council . When he was a young man he had had great honor : he had crossed the far waters in a boat to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been distinguished as a warrior , and as a young wife she had heard from the old men and women many tales of his boyhood . When he was twelve years old he had , unaided , shot down a great , raging she-bear and captured her cubs . l le had won his boy 's name , Bear Killer , from that hunt . It might please him to see the bear , himself , and the cubs here on the last carpet she might ever weave . When a man grows old his thoughts turn to his youth . Her husband had given his own boy 's name , Bear Killer , to this youth sleeping against the tree . She turned to look at him again . He had slid from the tree and was lying on the ground , on his back , breathing hard , his lips that always seemed to her so thick , a little opened . She ought to go over and rouse him . A gnat or some other evil thing might fly between those parted lips . She frowned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to spend so much time taking care of a young man old enough to be a warrior . Yesterday he had sat motionless on a log while a cluster of ants as large as a spread hand moved steadily towards him . When she explained that he must not crush these insects or they would settle under his skin , causing him to have malignant ulcers , he stared at her stupidly as if he did not believe what she said . Three moons ago her youngest son , the Little Owl , had had to turn back from a hunt before they were out of sight of the town : the Bear Killer in spite of all he had been told had stopped to make water on the Path . Angry as he was the Owl could not help laughing as he showed them how his foster-brother stood up to make water , like a dog or a two-year-old child . But the Owl was patient , like his father . He had purified himself and then had started again on his hunt , taking the white boy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy had got his name , but the bear was not very large and a he-bear , weak from his winter 's fast . At first it had made her uneasy to have this boy under her roof . Site had been afraid of the evil he might bring in with hint . Her husband , however , had explained to her that white people , being ignorant , were incapable of doing evil and therefore not subject to the same punishments as the Real People . Indeed , the physician , Climb- ing Bear , had confessed to her that he would not undertake to cure a white man of any but the simplest ailment . Their constitutions , he said , were so different from those of the Real People that it was impossible to predict the effect of medicine upon them : a dose of physic that would cure a man might kill a dog . The physician did not believe that the white people were human beings and he cited a tale he had had from his father 's father , a great man of the north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of an Ana-gun-wi-yi the lives of ten white men were exacted in payment , for it took ten of the short-tailed eunuchs ( as the old people called them ) to make up the life of one man of the Real People . She had said nothing of this to her husband , however , only looked into his eyes and repeated : " They do not cause diseases ? " He knew what she was thinking about : the epidemic that had come upon the Real People when he and she were a young married couple . It had been in the summer , not long after the festival of the green corn . Young men and women , some of them the handsomest of the tribe , had waked to find their bodies covered with watery blisters that swelled and reddened and finally burst , leaving ugly holes in the flesh . Some of the young men , finding themselves disfigured , had drowned themselves . Her own uncle , the Kingfisher , deprived by his family of all sharp-pointed instruments , had fallen again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field until finally the blood welled up in his pierced throat , and he died . The physician  --  it was before Climbing Bear 's time  --  said that the disease came from the lascivious conduct of the young men with the married women , and indeed there were many couples lying out in the fields that summer . But she knew that that was not the cause . Her oldest son , then eleven years old , too young to lie with any woman , had been covered all over with the dreadful sores . He had grown up , not knowing what it was to be unscarred , but she remembered his sleek boy 's skin and to this day she never looked upon him without remembering that the disease had come from the white people . She glanced again at the sleeping boy , recalling the way he had looked when her son brought him , still weak with fever , to their house . A thin , grayish , worm-like creature , his head covered with matted brown hair , his arse tied up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was well of the fever he would not speak or laugh and would hardly put out his hand to receive his food , onlyp237sat in a corner and stared out of dull eyes . Once the Owl , scuffling with him , had tried to rip the strips of cloth off his arse . The boy had squeaked like a bat and had showed fight and the Owl , out of kindness , had let him go . For months after that he had insisted on wearing his filthy , torn bandages until at last the young men had laughed him out of the womanish custom . Lately he had been anointing himself with bear 's grease until his skin had taken on a perceptible glow but under the shine it was still a muddy brown . It would never have any of the reddish lights that so delight the eye when a man is walking past and the sun plays on his naked limbs . Even when he wore the warrior 's white crown of swan 's feathers he would still be ugly . Why had the Man Above made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He stared around him as if he hardly knew where he was , then his clouded eye brightened as it fell on her . He got up and coming towards her asked where they all were . She understood that he referred to the Owl and the other young men and told him that they had gone to the river to fish . " I went to sleep , " he said , rubbing his eyes . She laughed at that . " I heard you sleeping , " she said . He laughed too  --  he had got so that he now joked and laughed with the family  --  and taking up his long cane spear set off down the village street . When he had gone it seemed quieter . The Dark Lanthorn stepped over to a bush and cutting off a twig sharpened it to a fine point , then dipped it into one of her pots . It came up covered with flakes of white paint . She approached the carpet and began tracing in one corner the outline of a deer . She worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced the form of this great heraldic deer on five other carpets ? Besides it was best to work swiftly once the picture was in the mind . Otherwise it might leave one and go to some other weaver . She showed her still fine teeth in a brief smile . Since her friend , Ganasita , had died there was no other woman in Chota industriousenough to weave carpets , not even the Ghigau whom in the last few years it was the fashion to praise above all other women . She bent nearer the frame and as she did so she felt a familiar twinge in the muscles of her lower back . The physician said it was rheumatism and for two years now he had made her abstain from t he meat of rabbits or any other hunched-up animal and had scratched her all over with a flint arrow-head ; but though he was a good physician and cured others he had not been able to take the pain from her back . She , an ignorant woman , did not know what caused it but she well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter they had had to spend in the forest , when Willenawah and Oconostota , the Great Warrior , had besieged the white men 's fort on the river . They had taken the fort and had killed and scalped a hundred white men but more white men had come after that and burned six of the towns and all of the crops and the people had had to spend the winter in the forest without shelter . She did not like to think of that old , unhappy time and was bending closer to her work when a noise on the street made her look up . A woman was approaching , leaning on a white oak stick , her husband 's niece , Nancy Ward , the Ghigau . The Ghigau was younger than the Lanthorn but of late years she had grown heavy and walked always now with a stick . The Lanthorn went to her and offered her her arm . The Ghigau took it as if she and not the Lanthorn were the old woman and the Lanthorn escorted her into the yard . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , sayingwhat was true , that few women nowadays understood the art of carpet weaving . The Lanthorn thanked her for the praise and stood listening with bent head while the Ghigau described a particularly succulent dish she had had that day : last year 's beans stewed with the wild sweet potato . The Lanthorn raised her head and stole a glance at the massive face framed between the silver earrings . The Ghigau 's hair was threaded with white . Her eyes were still large and lustrous but they had an absent glare . The Lanthorn looked into them , then lookedaway quickly . She does not see me . She does not hear my voice ! She took a step backward : a strange thought had come to her . The Ghigau was one of those persons  --  like the old white man , Fred Mouncy  --  who live on after the soul is reft from them . The Lanthorn wondered why she had not known before ; one can tell such persons by the look in the eye . A shiver ran up her spine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman that she and many others of the tribe would receive the first fruits of the new year and the new fire for the hearths . The Ghigau always officiated : she was the most beloved woman in the whole Nation . She had won her title years ago when in the battle against the Creeks she had taken up her deadp239husband 's musket and all the rest of that day had fought like a warrior . She was accounted a warrior  --  in council she spoke and was listened to as if she were a man . The Lanthorn had seen her raise the swan 's wing of her office and save from burning a captive already noosed to the stake . But the wife of a headman sees in her lifetime many strange things . The Lanthorn could not forget the night ten years ago when the trader , Brian Ward , left the Nation . Atta Kulla Kulla had discovered that his niece was following the man and had gone with his son , the young Dragging Canoe , to fetch her back . It was late at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the winter house . She had flung herself from the couch where they laid her down , screaming out that she would not live without the man and all that night she had raged , using words that were strange on a modest woman 's lips . The young Canoe , helping to hold her on the couch , had wept tears of anger that a woman of his family should be so mad for love of a white roan . ' l he Lanthorn , listening now to the Ghigau 's decorous talk , went back in her mind to that old time and she wondered how an Indian woman could bring herself to lie with one of the accursed ugly ones . For herself she would as soon take for lover a beast of the forest and yet others of the Real People did not feel as she did . Her husband called the white man , John Stuart , brother  --  indeed he had once given up everything he owned in order to save the life of that man . And her son , the DraggingCanoe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other man . The Ghigau was making her farewells . The Lanthorn was about to go back to her work when she saw three young girls coining towards her . She recognized the young widow , Monon , and walking next to Monon , her arm about her shoulder , was her own granddaughter , Na-Kwi ' - si . Na-Kwi ' - si lived ten miles away , on the Great Island , of which her father , the Lanthorn 's oldest son , was chief . 1 he Lanthorn had not known that her granddaughter was in the town and she called the girls to her . They came and stood before her , their arms still twined about each other 's shoulders . They wore new red cotton skirts and their hair hung loose and was newly oiled . They wore silver earrings . Drops of water shone on their black hair . Their faces had the fresh look of those who have just bathed . The Lanthorn spoke to them sternly : " You have been bathing in the river ? "  | Na-Kwi ' - si answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you went to the river from the osi , to purify yourselves ? " " Yes , Grandmother . " The old woman fixed her eyes on her granddaughter . " And why do you spend your dark time in the osi here instead of in your own woman 's lodge on the Island ? " " I was visiting my cousin and my sickness came upon me sud-denly . " The Lanthorn gave a dry laugh . " And how came you to be visiting at such a time ? A woman who can not reckon her own moons will come to no good end . " She continued to regard the girls sternly for a moment , then as they only looked down without speaking she dismissed them with a gesture of the hand . " Go now . But do not go to the river . The young men are fishing there and do not want to be disturbed . " They were gone in a flutter of red skirts . They would run past the next house and the next and then , taking care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the river and would spend the rest of the afternoon there . If they could , they would lure the men out of the river ; if the young men would not come they would stay on the bank , chattering and pretending to admire the fishers ' skill . She remembered what it was to be young . Girls were always wild after their seven days in the dark lodge . It had been twenty years since she had been inside its doors but she could still feel the dark of the place , hot with its womanish smells and always from the corner the wailing of some girl child brought in for the first time by her mother . The old women who guarded the doorway would not talk or look at the unclean ones , even when they placed food before them but always sat looking out into the green world . Once when she was a very young girl she had tried to break past one of those women . The old creature hardly moved , only switched her with a long bough , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the green boughs , clean these many years and free to go where she would she felt a longing to be back in that close , dark place . " I am an old woman , " she thought and then , amazed , " I shall not be here much longer ! " She left her carpet and took two steps forward . They carried her to the edge of the street . The path , in front of her house , was hardp241trampled , but a little farther down it was white with blossoms fallen from the crab apple tree in her neighbor 's yard . She walked down and stood under the tree and looked up into its boughs . There were no blossoms left . All were on the ground and the leaves that last week had been so frail were hardened into the dark green of summer . Standing under the green boughs she gazed towards the square . She could not see the town house for the overhanging leaves but she could hear a murmur of voices and knew that they came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She walked slowly back towards her own house and as she went she glanced up at the ridge-pole . The rag of scalp that fluttered there was so ancient that she could not remember the name of the enemy or how he had been taken . She had lived in this house ever since she was married , all but that one winter in the woods , and she had come back to this house that spring , for the white men out of respect had spared the beloved peace town of Chota when they laid the rest of the country waste . She had been born on the Great island , ten miles from here . She was fourteen years of age when she first saw the peace town of Chota , with its town house large enough to accommodatea hundred men , its holy square , its ancient elms , but ever since she had first beheld it she had had her home here . For nearly sixty years she had lived within a stone 's throw of the square , of the holy relics . Few women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a long life . She stepped back into her own yard and took her place before the carpet frame . She could hear her husband 's voice now , rising above that of the other men . Hearing his voice , which she had not heard for several hours , a feeling of tenderness came over her . She knew the picture she would paint . She picked up the sharpened stick and began tracing it on the earth : a man with a plume in his hair , standing in a boat . Under the boat she drew three wavy lines . Her husband as the young chief , White Owl , crossing the great water to talk with the White Father . He liked to think of that time . She would make a picture of it for him , here in the middle of her carpet.  |p242ARCHY  had gone to the river with the other young men that morning to fish . Towards noon he got hungry and went back to the house to get some stewed meat . He washed his meat down with a gourdful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down against a tree trunk to rest . He had not meant to go to sleep and he felt foolish when he woke and found the old Lanthorn looking at him . Anxious to get out of her sight he rose and , taking his fish spear , went down the street . He walked fast to the end of the street and turned into the double row of elms that ran through the middle of the town . As he walked along this avenue he slowed his steps , glancing towards the square . At this time of day the town house was deep in the shade of its great elm . Some of the older men were gathered in front of it , some sitting on reed divans , others sprawled on the ground or leaning against trees . He recognized his foster-father , the Carpenter , among them and beside him , towering over most of the men , the war chief , Oconostota . The shadows of the elm leaves were thick on the road he was traveling . A breeze sprang up . The shadows quivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fishermen came to him faintly . He shifted his hand down his pole until he found its middle and began to run lightly over the hard ground . He was nearing the avenue when he heard some one calling and stopped . " Yo-na-di-hi ! " They were calling him , the Bear Killer . He turned around and went towards them . There were half a dozen men taking their ease under the great tree . In the center the Carpenter sat on one of the long reed divans . The divan had been pushed up against the tree and the Carpenter leaned against the trunk as if it were the back of a chair . There was room for two or three men on each side of him but he sat alone . Facing him on another divan were the Old Tassel , head chief of all the Nation and Oconostota , the war chief , and his nephew ,  |p243the  Raven . The others , mostly old men , squatted on their haunches or leaned against trees . The Carpenter raised his yellow hand as Archy came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , my son . " Archy thanked him and would have squatted on the ground but the old chief patted the vacant place beside him . Archy rose and silently took the place the chief indicated . He was aware as he did so that the eyes of all the men in the circle had swung towards him and he kept his own eyes bent on the ground as he had seen the other young bucks do in the presence of the headman . But he wished that the Carpenter had not made him sit beside him . It was not fitting that a man as young as he , and a white man to boot , should be asked to sit beside the peace chief . But the Carpenter was used to having his way and at times thought little of his own dignity . He ' leaned over now and laying his arm lightly about Archy 's shoulders asked him where his brother , the Owl , was . Archy replied that the Owl and most of the other young men were at the river fishing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief smiled and shook his head . " It is pleasant here in the shade and the company is the best in the Nation . If the Bear Killer will sit with the old men he will learn wisdom . " Archy looked up and murmured the speech that politeness required , then bent his eyes on the ground again . 1 Ic had looked down almost immediately after speaking but not before he had caught the flicker of an ironical smile on the lips of the Raven . The war chief 's nephew did n't think much of him . I le wondered why . The other young men seemed to like him . The war chief spoke . " Atta Kulla Kulla has two sons to sit beside him now . " The other Indians all looked up . A big , tall man was coming swiftly around the side of the house . Archy had never seen him before but he recognized him by his size and his pock-marked face : Atta Kulla Kulla 's oldest son , the Dragging Canoe , chief of the Great Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the arm , then to each of the other headmen , then sat down on the divan beside his father . A middle-aged warrior rose and kneeling before him went through the motions of drawing the briars from his feet . The Canoe looked down at the fellow absent-mindedly , then checked him with a gesture when he would have brought water to pour over the dusty feet . " My feet are not hot , " he said . The Carpenter , his head tilted back , had been staring at a buzzard that sailed high above their heads in the blue . He looked at his son now and asked him the news from the island . The young chief replied that things were well with all his people , except the warrior , Going Deer , who had left on a hunt three weeks before and had not returned . The Carpenter said that his son should send a party out to search for the lost hunter . Dragging Canoe said that the party had already left . There was a long silence . The buzzard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V of his wings , then he was out of sight behind a clump of trees . Somebody hoisted a water jug up and drank with a gurgle . The Old Tassel folded his hands over his stomach , belched once and was asleep . Archy , his head still bent , stared from under drooping lids out over the square . The whole town must be asleep . No , there was one woman moving at the north end of the square , a broad figure in a striped gown . She turned her head as she went and the sun struck light from her long silver earrings . Oconostota spoke in a quiet , meditative voice : " Atta Kulla Kulla , who is the most beautiful girl you ever saw in your life ? " There was a titter from one of the young men . The peace chief had closed his eyes and seemed to be asleep but he opened them readily . " A woman 's beauty lies in her spirit . My wife , the Dark Lanthorn , was fourteen years of age when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful woman I have ever seen , then or since . " Oconostota smiled at his friend , his eyes still following the figure moving at the other end of the square . " The Ghigau was older than that when she first came to Chota . I believe she was the most beautiful woman I ever saw . Ten years ago she was still handsome but then  --  then , I tell you , she moved like a moon beam ! " His nephew , the Raven , laughed . " Our grandmother , the Ghigaumoves more like a cow these days . " The pock-marked chief , Dragging Canoe , spoke in a harsh voice . " She drinks the milk of the cow . Perhaps it makes her heavy  --  or it may be the heaviness comes from lying with white men . "  | " It has been many years since Nancy Ward had a white lover , " his father said mildly . " It has been ten years since she had a white lover here in the Nation , " the Canoe said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods . " Oconostota laughed . " That 's so . She has gone many times to visit her old lover . She begs him to come back and live in the Nation . Ile wo n't come , she says , but he always receives her honorably . " Dragging Canoe laughed too but said nothing . The Raven had been looking at the Canoe . Now he spoke . " Do you consider the cow an unholy beast ? " " For those who do not wish to move like a cow . . . . I have not touched cow 's milk these five years . " The Raven smiled and touched the blanket he was sitting on . " You wear a blanket when it is cold . " The Canoe shook his head . " I do not love the white man 's gifts . My wife weaves my blanket out of the hair of the buffalo . " " But there are no buffalo left in the land . " " They may come back . " The Raven , his dark eyes shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rested between the Canoe 's knees . " This is the white man 's best gift . " " I keep it only till they are all run out of the land , " Dragging Canoe said . " When they are gone I 'll shoot my game with the bow and arrow . " " The white men will never go , " Oconostota said sadly . " They are like lice . Each one so small he is nothing . A hundred and you have an itching head . " " I would cut my head off before it should become a breeding place for vermin , " Dragging Canoe said . The Carpenter raised a thin , yellow hand that trembled ever so slightly . " The white men are our brothers , " he said . " We are all children of the same Father . I was told that when I crossed the great water ... " Some of the men exchanged glances . One yawned . Archy wished that he could get up and leave . The Carpenter , when he started on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . And no one would dare to interrupt the great peace chief . He glanced at the Canoe . He was not even pretending to listen to his father but sat , his sinewy legs thrust straight out in front of him , staring at the ground . Archy let his eyes travel up the naked body to the massive head . The Canoe was the biggest Indian he 'd ever seen and the handsomest , in spite of his pock-marked face . The Owl said that he was the strongest man in the Nation . Once when the river was in flood he had swum across it three times , rescuing children and women who were too old to swim . . . He hated white men , all except the British agent , Alexander Cameron , whom the Indians called " Scotchie . " But then , as the Owl said , Scotchie was his blood brother  --  he was bound to love him . " The way I love you , " the Owl had said . Archy gazed down at his own thin brown wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fingers , that day they made him into an Indian . They had just finished pulling out all his hair except the scalp lock and had painted him up and loaded him with wampum and silver bracelets when the Owl suddenly grabbed him by the wrist and yanked him out into the street . Round and round they had gone until it seemed as if their two hands had grown together , the Owl yelling and the whole town streaming after them . It had been a relief when they turned him over to the women to wash in the river . They had done the job well . He had been as limp as a soaked herring when he came out . . . . He could not remember much of what went on after that . They had been in the council house a long time , all the warriors sitting around , the smoke thick enough to choke you . The Carpenter had made the speech : " My son , you are now flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone . By the ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was washed out of your veins . You arc now one of us by an old strong law and custom . My Son , you have nothing to fear . . . " It was the Carpenter who had said all that . It was the Carpenter who was talking now . " . . . houses on each side of the street as thick as beans in a pod . The Great Father 's winter house is as big as this whole town . The warriors that guard it are covered all over with cloth and the cloth shines ... " The Dragging Canoe stood up . " I am going back to the Island , " he said . His eyes rested for a second on his father . " The searching party came in last night , " he said . " They brought the Going Deer on a litter , in four pieces . " The Carpenter 's black eyes opened wide and fixed his son 's face . His lips formed a soundless question.  |p247The  Canoe passed his hand in front of his throat , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a trunk . His hand came back to his side , then went out again , rested a second on his privates . " Five pieces , " he said . " They cut this off too . " The Raven muttered a word . Archy had never heard it before but he knew what it meant , that the white men were all eunuchs . The Indians were always saying that the white men could not enjoy loving . He realized that the Dragging Canoe , still standing there in the middle of the crowd , was staring at him , absent-mindedly as if he hardly knew who he was . He looked back . All Indians had black eyes but this man 's eyes were blacker than any he 'd ever seen , except for that spark that cleft the pupil . A shining spark , shaped like a knife . White men had used a cutty knife to dismember the Going Deer 's body . A thin knife that shone , cutting through red flesh ... . " My son , you are now one of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have nothing to fear . . . . " He took a step backward and could have burst into tears . He had moved then only because the Canoe was turning away ! The Canoe was walking off slowly between the two divans . He passed from under the shade of the big elm and disappeared around the corner of the town house . Oconostota had sat down again on his divan . His great , domeshapedhead was bowed a little forward . 1 le studied the ground . The Carpenter was talking with the Raven and two other warriors . Archy slipped from the Carpenter 's side to the edge of the crowd . I le turned then and spoke in a low voice . " I am going to the river to fish , Father . " He picked up his spear , crossed the square and turned into the avenue . It was quiet here in the dense shade . Nobody in sight ... . Yes , ahead of him three girls were walking . They heard steps behind them . One of them turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daughter . One of the other girls Archy had never seen before , but the third figure , taller and thinner than the others , was familiar . He hurried and fell into steps beside them . " Good evening , beautiful daughters of the Wind and the River , " he said , using the kind of talk he had heard the Owl and the other young fellows use . Amo-gun-yi laughed . " Good evening , Bear Killer , are you still tucking eggs ? "  | Archy stared at her . At first he did not know what she meant ; then he remembered . She had come by the other day when the Lanthorn was boiling him some eggs . The Indians boiled theirs till they were as hard and blue as bullets but he always made the Lanthorn take his out while they were still soft . He laughed too . " Yes , I have sucked up all the hen eggs and now I am going to the river to look for turtle eggs . " Amo-gun-yi leaned forward , making a barking sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girls laughed . The other girl looked straight ahead . Archy looked at her across the bent bodies of the other two . He was not even certain that it was Monon but he asked the question anyhow . " Where have you been ? I have n't seen you in a long time ? " The other two were straightening up . Their heads came between him and her and so he did not see her face as she answered , only heard her voice . " I have been mourning my husband . " Amo-gun-yi was the kind of girl who could n't stop anything once it got started . She was making the offensive sound again . This time she was a snake , climbing a tree to get birds ' eggs . He gave her a hard look . " The daughter of the great chief ought not to travel with a suck-egg dog , " he said and fell behind them . They were walking on . Amo-gun-yi had wanted to stop and rally him some more but the others pulled her forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face working , ready to start giggling all over again . He stuck his tongue out at her , at the same time bringing his right hand up in an obscene gesture . That settled her . Her face changed . She turned around and went about her business . They turned off into one of the side streets . Just as they rounded the corner Monon looked back at him over the other girl 's shoulder . He could have laughed . She was like him , wondering if this was the man or whether it could have been some other fellow ! He walked on , balancing the light spear in his hand . I have been mourning my husband . That was why he had not seen her anywhere . It-seemed a long time since the festival but it was just a year ago this month  --  the festival of the green-eared moon when the first young corn was ripe . It had been his first big Indian shindig . They , yp249painted the town house white and the headmen went around with wreaths of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands . There had been a lot of singing and dancing . He had kept himself as scarce as he could . They fasted for eight days before they had the big dinner . That was when you had to walk mighty straight . It was a sin for a man to so much as touch the skin of a girlchildduring those eight days , the Owl said . After it was all over they had the big dinner and some more singing and dancing . It was when they were all dancing in the square that the Owl had come to him , bouncing along like a bird , laughing all over . " Time now , " he said , and took Archy down into the grove on the side of the square . As they went he explained . Most of the young men were waiting on the other side of the square . The women always made a break when the dancing was over . The Raven and his crowd figured they would head that way and , being in the first line , would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's night . Some sour old bitch was likely to get hold of you and not let go . It was better to do the choosing yourself . This morning at the spring he had been talking with a very attractive young married woman , the wife of  --  oh , he would never tell the name of her brave husband ! Ile had asked her about the festival , particularly about the hour after the ( lancing when the women were free to take what man they chose . She said that that was very nice for women who did not have a fine husband like hers or women who were such fools that they did not know a fine husband when they had one . As for her , she took no part in such frolics and always went straight to her house as soon as the dancing was over . He asked her which side of the square she traveled on her way home and she said that on her way home she always looked towards the sun . Somebody had come up just then and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was leaving he called after her to know how many women went with her into the open lands to pick sallet the other day . She called back that she had had only one friend with her so he would take only one man with him . The Bear Killer was his brother and he would share everything with him , even the pleasures of the blanket and he came dose and laughed and squeezed Archy 's arm the way he was always doing . It was a cedar grove there on the east side of the square . The trees stood up straight and tall , like people , no , like giants  --  the biggest cedars he had ever seen in his life . They had had to go quite a way into the grove to get out of the light from the torches . They stood behind a big cedar whose boughs came down to the ground and waited . The Owl kept talking about the girl he 'd had last year . Archy did n't talk . He was hoping the Owl would n't find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lessie Robinson . He was having a round with her in the bushes on the way home from church but he had n't more than got her down when Rion came up on them and yanked him off by the scruff of the neck and said that the Robinsons were trash and that he 'd give him the beating of his life if he ever caught him with her again . The Indian girls had come weaving their way through the big cedars , talking and laughing but keeping their voice low so that a person a few feet off could n't have recognized them . The Owl knew his girl and went up to her . They turned off into the dark . He could n't even see his girl 's face . He did n't know what name to call . her by . He had stood there like a fool  --  until she leaned over and put her hands on him . He was startled but he took the hands and pulled her up against him . They went down together there in the grass . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it away from him as they said . He 'd often wondered what it would be like . Now he knew . But he wondered still . Would it be very different with a white girl ? You had to make over them , warm them up , he 'd always heard . But this Cherokee girl was hotter than he was . When he got weak she could hardly wait for him to get strong again ... . He had gone to sleep with her lying across him , her arms tight around his neck . When he woke the moon was gone . It was almost day . The Owl was standing over him . The Owl would n't wait long enough for him to say goodbye even . And he would n't tell him the girl 's name but he had let slip the name of her husband . That was when Archy said that he would like to see her again . The Owl laughed until he had to lean against a tree . " Round 0 will shoot you if you come to his cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed , a month later , falling off a big rock somewhere over in the mountains . Archy had attended the burial service , had seen the widow from afar off , standing with other members of her family but she had disappeared after the burial . He had never talked to her again , until today ... .  |p251He  had come to the end of the avenue . From here a broad plain sloped down to the river . They had cleared out most of the trees but a few were left standing . Three or four houses stood in the shade of these trees . One of them was the house of the white trader , Captain Gist who , three years ago , had married Wurteh , sister to the Old Tassel , and ever since then had resided in the Nation . Captain Gist was sitting in his yard . Archy raised his hand in salute and walked past , then on an impulse turned back into the yard . Gist , naked , Indian fashion , except for his flap , was sitting on a stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . He was changing the flint . As Archy approached he held the gun up in front of him . " What do you think of this for the best smooth-bore that has come into the Nation , Master Outlaw ? " Archy took the gun and examined it . It was of British make . " It 's worth all of five guineas , " he said , " and if I had ' cm I 'd give it ye . " Gist smiled and taking up a tuft of rabbit 's hair dipped it into a cup of grease and began to oil the gun . " I 'll sell it to the Dragging Canoe , " he said . " I hear he 's in the town today . " " He was over at the town house , " Archy said , " but he left . Said he was going back to the island . " " The Raven then . Or maybe the Old Tassel himself 'll fancy it . It 's a gun for a headman now surely . " " The Dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men arc run out of the land , " Archy said . Gist glanced up sharply but said nothing . Archy watched him as he leaned over to drop the tuft of rabbit 's hair back into the cup . The twisting movement sucked his belly in and made his ribs stand out until you could almost count them . I le was as hollow-ribbed as an Indian and his flesh was as red . The red came from bear 's grease lint aside from that he could have passed for an Indian , with his black ryes and his coarse black hair . Archy wondered if the Indians lilted him because he was so much like themselves . No man in the Nation had ever risen as quickly as he had . He had come to Chota five years ago , to trade , and now he was married to the sister of the head chief and spoke in council . It was not only his wife 's relatives that favored him . The Indians all liked him , so much that they had given him a whole island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one Dragging Canoe was chief of . But Gist had never gone to take up his island . He preferred to stay on here in the Nation , living the life of a warrior and trading a little on the side . There was a sound from the bushes behind them , a bleat such as a lamb might make . Archy turned around and saw a young child hanging in his board from the limb of a tree . Gist got up and took the board down , then unfastened the thongs and tumbled the child out on the ground . A boy , fat for an Indian baby , not yet old enough to stand . He started crawling . Gist watched him a minute , picked him up and , extending his arms to their full length , shot him up over his head . The child shut his eyes tight but made no sound except to gulp when he took in his breath . Gist set him on the ground . He gulped again and without looking up started crawling . Gist laughed . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards . I take him down every now and then to give him a chance . " They sat watching the baby crawl off over the ground . Finally Archy spoke : " One of Dragging Canoe 's men got killed the other day . " " Who killed him ? " " White men . " They sat there . Gist 's eyes were still on the crawling child . Archy studied the half-averted cheek . Gist suddenly turned around . His black eyes were on Archy 's face . " The Canoe have any idea who did it ? " " He said it was white men . . . . Reckon there 'll be a war ? " Gist shook his head . When he did not say anything else Archy got to his feet and went and stood in front of him and stared down into his face . " I 'm a white man , " he said . His voice rose and cracked . " I do n't want to be here ' mongst these Indians if there 's going to be a war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man twisted his head to one side , as if , stark naked as he was , he was wearing a collar that galled him . When he spoke his voice was quiet . " The Carpenter is a reasonable man . So is the Tassel . " Archy could feel the sweat break out on his forehead . " But what if there was a war ? " Gist suddenly got up . His voice changed , became sharp , as if Archy were a dog or a horse that he was commanding to stand still . " Shut up , Outlaw ! "  |p253Archy  stared at him , his mouth open . But Gist was not looking at him . He was looking towards the house . Wurteh was just coming through the doorway . Her long braids swung to one side as she stooped to get through the opening . She straightened up and smiled at her husband . Gist stepped over , picked up the child and started towards her . Archy took a step after them and stopped . He and Gist had been talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Goodbye . I have had a talk with your husband and now I am going to the river . Goodbye . " He left them and walked off fast , down the first path he came to . After a while he stopped . This was not the way to the river . He must have taken the wrong turn , back there where the path forked . This path led to the town . He faced about . 1 le could still hear the shouts of the fishermen but faintly . Spearing fish from the canoes ; probably working up the river . If he struck through the woods and walked up the path along the river he would come up with them . Ile had his spear . The Owl would be tired by this time and would let him have his canoe . He chose the path that would take him to the river , followed it a few steps , and sat down with his back against a tree . I is lips moved . In his mind he was still talking to Gist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian . You ca n't go on all your life pretending you 're an Indian . You 're a white man . Same as inc . " He drew a long , sobbing breath , then was silent , looking about him . This was a place he 'd never seen before , but he 'd know it for Cherokee country if he came to it in his sleep . The giant sycamore in front of him had ferns growing on its lower branches . The trunk was split up to where the first branch put out . lc got up and walked over to it . The split had conic a long time ago . ' I'he inner wall was hollowed out and covered with a smooth substance that was as hard as bark , only not white . Ile slipped through the opening and , stretching his hands out on each side of him , touched only air . A yoke of oxen could stable here and not tramp each other. le looked down at the mold in which his feet were sunk . Black , fine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many years had it been piling up here inside the hollow trunk ? He glanced up over his head where ferny moss and leaves mingled . These trees were taller even than the ones on the square . When you asked the Indians about these big trees they smiled in a secret way or laughed out . Was this country older than other countries ? Had these trees always been here , since the beginning of time ? He stepped out from the hollow trunk and threw himself down on the ground , burying his face in the dead leaves . At first he kept on seeing white trunks in black air and then ferns and leaves . But they went away . There was left only the black . He pressed his face deeper into the rustling leaves and thrust his fingers into his ears . Keep out the white trunks , keep out the sound of this river , and he could hear the Yadkin flowing over its bright marble rocks , could see his father 's house set in its grove on the green hill . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house or hear the Yadkin water . He was moving slowly , through bright air , over ground so hot that it burned his feet . The hickory handle was warm and sweaty in his grasp . He sank the hoe into a hill . It struck on a clod . There was a place there in the south field where the dirt was always cross-grained and caked . Once , years ago , it had been plowed when it was wet . It would always be like that , Rion said , ruined forever . . . . On a hot day Rion would hoe faster than usual , then get through before you did and wait for you at the end of the row . If you hoed up and tried to catch him he would laugh . . . . Rion was the strongest man anywhere around Trading Ford . He did n't suppose there was any man in all of Rowan stronger than Rion , unless it would be that blacksmith at Hillsborough ... . Somebody was coming . He sat up suddenly , rubbing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots of a big beech and came and squatted on the ground in front of him . She did not speak or touch him , just squatted there looking at him . After a little she said something but he did not know what she was saying and he did not answer . She looked away , studying a clump of ferns that came up there between them . He studied her face . It was thinner than he remembered it and the upper lip was shorter than in most of the Cherokee women . She turned her head to the side . Light slid through the leaves and fell on her cheek . There was a lily that grew in the fields at home , tiny , perfect flowers on a brave stalk . Her skin was the light , pure red of those petals . She was standing up , saying again the words he did not understand . " I do n't know , " he said vaguely , not realizing that he spoke English . She came up to him and laid her hand on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle sound , looked away , to one of the paths that went through the brake . He set his left hand against the small of her back and drew her to him . With his other hand he ripped off the fathom of stroud cloth that was tied about her loins . When he would have torn away the wad of moss bound against her , she broke away from him . She was at the edge of the brake , gathering up the strip of cloth , turning to look over her shoulder . He caught up with her and they ran together into the brake.  |p256THERE  WERE two hours of sun left when Rion finished planting his last hill of corn . He went to the river to get a drink and came back and sat on a stump to rest and looked over the field . He was glad now he had n't gone to the Watauga with Frank and Jacob . It would have taken a day each way for the trip and another day for the frolic  --  he would have been into next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in before the rain that was blowing up . A week could make a mighty difference . He got up and walked down the field towards the creek , a zig-zag course , for he had to walk around a stump every few minutes . He would like to know how much land  --  how much solid dirt  --  he had cleared but it was hard to figure when the stumps took up as much room as the dirt itself . He thought of that first year . The fire had licked over this land for three days running . They had got the logs burned off or burned down to where they could handle them , but most of the stumps were only charred on the outside . They would . be here for many a year yet . Still , counting stumps and girdled trees , he must have two whole acres cleared . And the land was rich . He 'd make two hundred bushels of corn this year . He was about to turn up the path to his house when he remembered that Elsa had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some stools . She had the hides ready and Jacob had drilled the holes for the thongs , but she thought Rion had a better sleight than Jacob at putting the thongs through . He crossed the creek and walked up to the Wagners ' house . Elsa was sitting on the doorstep scouring her plates . He dropped down beside her . " How you making out , with your old man gone ? " She did not look up , just went on scouring her plate . " Cat got your tongue ? " he asked . She looked up then . " I wish I had a cat or something to make a fuss . There ai n't been a sound in this house all day . I got so I was feared to hear myself move around . "  | " Yet you'could n't wait this spring till you got you a house built over here . " " A body wants her own house , but she do n't want to be alone in it . " " I ca n't see as Jacob is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have much to say . " " Hunh ! You 'll do well if you 're as good company , time you 're his age . It ai n't so much what he says as having him around . That man , he 's like a baby about me . If 1 run off here into the bushes a minute he 's a-calling , ' Ma , what you doing ? ' 1 told him the other day , There 's times folks do n't want to tell what they 're doing , even if they ai n't anybody to hear ' em . ' " And she laughed and a little color came up in her cheeks . Rion laughed too , thinking how different this old woman was from Gassy , who would never mention running off into the bushes to anybody , let alone joke about it . She had put her plate to one side and sat , her hands limp in her lap , gazing before her . Jacob had cut out a mighty small dooryard . The trees pressed right up to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . She took a quick breath and turned to him . " Hit 's still , ai n't it ? " " Hit 's still , " he agreed , " if you do n't listen to the water . " She let her breath out in a long sigh . " If Jacob or me dies out here , we 'd be buried by this creek . " " What 's the difference ? If you was to die at home you 'd he buried by the Yadkin . Close to it probably . Ai n't the Free Baptist burying ground down by the river ? " " Hit 's down there , " she said absently and went on talking , more to herself than to him . " It ai n't being so far from honk . It 's being out here where the woods is so thick , where nobody do n't hardly know where you are . If we was buried by this creek chances arc would n't nobody ever pass by our grave , and if they did they would n't know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " Rion stood up . " What about them stools ? " She went with him into the house and brought the stools and hides and set them before him . He squatted on the floor and laced the thongs through , making her hold the hides down while he fastened them as tight as he could.  | " There , " he said , " I reckon that 'll hold up anybody comes to this house . " " You about the heaviest man comes here , " she said . " Frank nor Amos Eaton do n't weigh much more'n a scarecrow , either of them . " She stepped to the shelf and took down a platter half full of walnut meats . In the old days when he and Jacob finished trading she would always bring him a tart or a " wonder , " but now that she did n't have flour or sugar to do with , it was walnuts . But she took just as much care now as she did then , getting the boy 's breeches out whole every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shelf . As he ate he looked around the room . Ten by eight , two feet shorter than his own house each way , but a neat , tight house all the same . After all , there were only two of them in it . He stepped to the fire , pulled the lug pole out and let it swing back . " It 's cracked , " he said . " You ought to get Jacob to fix it . " " He keeps promising , but now he 's started his sluice he ai n't got no time for anything else . " " His sluice ? " Rion said . " You mean he 's building him a sluice ? " She nodded . Rion pushed past her and went outside . He walked a little away from the house towards the creek , Elsa following him . They had not gone far before they found the place . She was right . The old coot was starting a sluice . Ten uprights in already and more lying on the ground ready to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rion said . " How 's he going to get him a wheel after he gets the sluice built ? " " Amos Eaton says they 's a wright over in Carter 's Valley got tools to work with . Amos , he took the man 's word and he sent back word he 'd come when Jacob was ready for him . " Rion laughed . " Say he gets a wheel set up . Who 's going to bring him corn ? " " He says they 'll be plenty to come time he gets the wheel turning . Says he met some folks on the south end of Eaton 's ridge the other day was looking for land to settle . " " Lots of folks say they 're going to settle and do n't , and if they do , how 's he know they got enough git-up to make a crop ? " She was not listening , looking back over her shoulder . " They 's somebody at the house , " she said , and made off through the bushes . Rion followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep259house , looking dog-tired . He went up to them . " Well , I see you 're starting a mill , " he said to Jacob . Jacob looked at him as if he hardly knew who he was . " They must a been two hundred men there , " he said . " White folks or Indians ? " " White folks . I ai n't counting the Indians . They was men from the Doe and men from the Watauga and some from up as far as Carter'sValley . They was some from as far off as the Clinch , and they must a been a dozen from Wolf hills . They piled the goods up in a heap and the Indians walked round and round ' cm . They was eight dozen matchcoats and wristbands and a lot of duffields , besides the guns and powder . Some of it was mighty sorry stuff , but they made it out two thousand dollars ' worth . . . . But it was good enough for them Indians . They was some of them there looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it and wrap around themselves and laugh like children .... " " What did the white folks do ? " Rion said . " After they come all that way what did they do ? " " They set up a government , " Frank told him . I le looked at his brother-in-law and laughed . " You better walk straight now . We got magistrates and a clerk and a sheriff too . " Rion squatted against a tree . " The country 's ruined , " he said . Elsa came to the door and asked Jacob and Frank if they wanted their supper now . They said they did and she turned back into the house to prepare it . Jacob and Frank sat down side by side on the doorstep . Rion squatted in front of them , chewing on a grass blade . " I ca n't see what they done that for . We come out here , the most of us , to get shut of the law . " Frank said : " They set up a government to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that after all that talk , all we done was lease the land again ? " Frank shook his head impatiently . " You do n't sec , Rion , many times as I 've told you . They 've got us in a cleft stick . Ever since the Virginians ran that new line . You ai n't in Virginia and you ai n't in Carolina , then where are you ? " " I be dog if I know , " Rion said . " You 're on Indian land . And you ca n't buy land from any Indians . The King made a law about that . "  | " There 's too much law , " Rion said . " I come out here to get shut of it . " " You 'd have to go a far piece to get shut of the law , " Frank said , " and even then it 'd follow you . " Elsa called the men in to their supper . Rion stood up . " I 'll be going up to the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why n't he stay here the night ? " Elsa asked . " Dog-tired as he is he do n't want to be walking no farther . " Frank looked up , his mouth full of turkey . " I 'll be up first thing in the morning , " he said . Rion crossed the creek and started up the path he had cut out between the houses last spring . He walked slowly , thinking over what had been said . If he 'd only pushed farther up the Holston when he first came out ! He 'd be in Virginia then and could claim his land as a first settler . But no , he had to stop right here where the trouble was . He 'd been on this land two years and there 'd been trouble from the start . The new line had been run the very year he came . All the south Holston settlements  --  the Watauga , the Doe , the Nolichuckyhadcome out on the Indian side . How was a man to know just by looking at land whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , paid the Indians a little something for the land instead of taking it the way most folks did . But that had n't helped . The British agent said they must all move off . Jacob Brown , over on the Nolichucky , had picked up and moved overnight . Maybe he ought to go too . Go to Kentuck where he 'd planned to go in the first place ... . He emerged from the path and suddenly was in the clearing . Coming up from the river like this you 'd never know there was a clearing and a house in here unless you happened to strike this path . That was what Elsa did n't like , being where folks might pass by and never know that you were there , but he did n't know that he 'd want his house out on the road for all the world to see . Every night when he came up through the woods it was a surprise to come on the clearinglike this . You 'd think that it was dark , but when you got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting lighter all the time , the way he kept falling trees . Sometimes when he was resting after dinner he 'd get up right quick and fall one and sometimes he 'd stop and fall one on the way to the field . If a man kept his axe handy he could fall a lot of trees in a lifetime . And as he told them every one down wasp261one out of the way . His dooryard would be bare now if it was n't for Cassy . She made him leave some just because she liked to look at them . That big fir there in the south corner . She said he was never to fall it on any account . And she 'd made him leave the big shellbarkhickories , one at each corner of the house . He looked at the house where it sat under the interlacing boughs . A good-sized crib , twelve by twelve , each way . Now that the roof and chimney were on it looked larger . They 'd wanted him to cat and clay the chimney , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 'd held out to use the rocks over in that pile by the spring . They were the right size and flat , most of them , so that they worked up nicely . It 'd taken him all of two weeks to build the chimney , but when he was done it drew . Suck a corn shuck up like a March wind . It was a hard thing to have to put puncheon on for a roof , but he had no way in God 's world to rive out shingles . Puncheon it had to be . But it was tight . Not a leak in two years . A good house , every log matched at the corners . And yet it did n't look right to him . That was because of the room that was n't built vet . I lc 'd had it in his mind now for a whole year . It had got so the house looked lop-sided to him without it . Gassy wanted him to make a lean-to at the north . Said that way the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mind to make another crib facing south . That was the way the old house was at home . No sense building unless you did it right , even if it did take you longer . They could put a lean-to on later if they needed it ... . If he moved , like Brown and the rest , he would n't 1 ) c building either crib or lean-to ... . He walked through the dooryard and was about to step up into the house when he saw Malcolm coming around the corner . He had on nothing but his hippens and he was dragging a brush broom . It was hard pulling for him . Each time he flung out a leg it wobbled and seemed about to double on him , but he kept his balance and made it as far as the hickory tree , then sat down on a root with a plop . Rion waited until he had sat down , then went and squatted in front of him . " What you doing , boy ? " Malcolm had been so busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his father was there until Rion was right in front of him. He started and his face settled into the solemn expression it always had when he knew anybody was looking at him . Rion , looking into his eyes , observed that in the last few weeks the pupils had grown darker . When he had been born they were blue , like all young things , but they 'd been turning ever since . They 'd be a blackish grey like Cassy 's before he was through . He picked the child up , and getting to his feet danced around with him until he himself was dizzy and had to lean against a tree . " How you like that ? " he asked . Malcolm had crowed out when they first started going around , but now he was squirming in Rion 's arms . Rion set him down . Malcolmreached for his broom , and as soon as he had hold of it sat down again on the root of the tree . Rion glanced over his shoulder , but no one was in sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he whispered . Malcolm raised his head and gave his father the same solemn stare ; then his gaze wandered . Suddenly a light came into his eye . His mouth opened wide and he held out his arms . " Mammy ! " he cried . " Mammy ! " Rion turned around . Jocasta was coming up the path from the garden . He went to meet her . He slipped his arm about her and he could feel the swelling under her waist-band . She was six months gone , though you would n't think it , seeing her step along so light . " What you been doing ? " he asked . She leaned up against him for a second , then suddenly sprang away , catching at his hand . " Come here . I got something to show you . " He followed her around the house to the garden patch . " You want inside ? " he asked , and when she nodded he lifted the slab gate back and followed her down the rows . As he went he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground a week , but they were already pushing through and the beans he had planted six weeks ago were in full blossom . Cassy was bending over the beans now . " Look , " she said , and pulled a stalk towards him . He looked at the lavender and white blossoms and saw where two or three were withered and the tiny , perfect little beans already formed . " You got sharp eyes , " he said . " I looked here yesterday and did n't see a bean . " She was bending farther down the row , running her hand inp263among the leaves . " Here , " she said and pulled another stalk out . There , swinging under the broad leaves , were half-a-dozen beans as long as his index finger . Still stooping she looked up at him . " Are n't they forward ? " He bent and fingered one of the slim , green beans . " We 'll have snaps inside a week , " he said . He held his hands out and drew her to her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate he stopped and looked over the garden again . " I 'll try to git in here for an hour or two tomorrow . " " I 'll hoe the pumpkins , " she told him , " and I 'll give the snaps another little working while I 'm at it . " " You better not be hoeing now , " he said . " You might strain yourself . " They had come to the corner of the house where they could see into the front dooryard . Malcolm was holding the brush broom in both hands and pushing it back and forth over the bare ground . " Look at him , " Cassy said . " Sweeping . Now , ai n't that sweet ? " The child looked up . He did not drop the broom immediately , but he made only a few more strokes after she had spoken , and in a few seconds he laid it down . Rion frowned . " What makes him do that way ? " " He do n't ever like for you to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She moved past him to the bench that sat beside the back door . Both water buckets were empty . He took them to the spring and filled them . When he came back Cassy called out that the back log was about gone , so he stood a chunk of buckeye on end and split it in two with his axe . When he had finished splitting the chunk he picked up one of the back logs . As he walked across the yard he looked up at the house . It was almost dark outside , but the little fire that was on the hearth showed a glow through the doorway . Cassy was in the corner , rocking the cradle . He could sec her hand come out each time to meet it and push it away . He stepped up into the house , tip-toed across the floor , and put the log on as quietly as he could , and tip-toed to the front door . The cradle was bumping slower each time now . Malcolm ought to drop off any second . He sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . His thoughts went hack to his talk with Frank . Suppose he did move off like the others . Would he better himself ?  | Jump from the frying pan into the fire , most likely . If the King said you could n't buy land from the Indians , what was the sense of moving ? The same thing would come up again sooner or later . Robertson was probably right when he said stay here and work things out . He 'd been talking with the chiefs all spring . Some of them wanted the settlers to stay  --  if they would n't take up more land . Well , the result of all Robertson 's work was the meeting today . They had the land for another eight years . When the time was up there 'd be some new hanky-panky . The British agent would be telling them to move on again . Yet a lot could happen in eight years . In eight years there might be enough of them to dare the British agent . The govern-. ment they 'd set up today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Frank and Jacob , but he did n't know but that he was wrong . As Frank said , you had to go a far piece to get shut of the law . . . . But the law had to start some time . Somebody had to make it to start with . No sense in men across the water making law for folks on this side . Folks on this side knew the country , knew what they had to deal with . They ought to stand up on their own hind legs and make their own law . He brought his clenched fist down on his knee . " I 'm with ' em , " he said aloud . Gassy was at his back , dropping down fast as a shadow , to clap her hand over his mouth . " Shh ! " and in the same whisper , " what you talking about ? " " I do n't know , " he said , confused . " It 's a way I got into , being out in the woods by myself so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What you got ? " " There was some of the poke sallet left and I can warm you a slice of the deer meat . " " I 'll have it in a minute , " he said . " I ai n't downright hungry yet . " She sat down beside him . He reached over , took her hand , and laid it flat against his thigh with his own hand over it . They watched the great yellow moon rise up behind the trees . Suddenly a harsh scream came from the river . Gassy jumped . " What 's that ? " " It 's a swan . Must a gone to roost already and something came prowling around . " " What you reckon it was ? "  | " Pole cat , most likely . . . I found the place where those swans roost the other day . Little island . Ground just white with down and the droppings a foot thick . " She did not answer . He pressed his hand closer over hers and put his other arm about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Yadkin , hearing those swans cry . You could always hear the river there , from any place in the house . Ai n't it funny now , I come all this way through the woods and found me another place on a river ? " A little sound came from the room behind them : Malcolm sighingin his sleep . She was on her feet . 1 le followed her into the house . She bent over the cradle a minute , then came back to where he was standing beside the hearth . The fire had been banked with coals since late afternoon . Only a few embers showed through the ashes . I lc took the poker and stirred them till they glowed , and brought fresh logs and laid them across the stone andirons . He fanned the embers with a turkey wing and a blaze sprang up ; then , still on his knees , he looked over his shoulder into the room now filled with the bright light . I lis eyes rested on Frank 's empty bed , then went to Gassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the hearth . Ile looked into her eyes and smiled . " This is the first night we been here by ourselves , " he said , " the very first night . " She got up from the stool and came to him and put her arms about his neck . They were standing together there in the middle of the floor when she suddenly drew away . " There 's somebody coming on horseback , " she whispered . Rion glanced at his rifle hung on its pegs over the door . He was moving towards it when a voice spoke from outside : " Outlaw ! " " It 's James Robertson , " he said to Gassy . Ile went to the door . " What 's the matter , Robertson ? " Robertson was pulling a limb of the big hickory down , getting ready to hitch his horse . He came up into the room on the trot , breathing hard , his grey eyes looking almost black in the firelight . " I want you to go with me to Chota , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What you going to Chota for ? You had all the Indians in the country over at the Watauga today . " " They went home . All of ' em . In a huff. " 266 GREEN CENTURIES " What 's the matter ? " Rion said . " Frank told me the trade went off all right . " Robertson looked at Cassy as if he were only just now seeing her . " Your pardon , mistress . " He turned back to Rion . " The trade went off all right . The trouble started at the ball play . There was some bullies there from Wolf Hills . They killed that Cherokee they call Billie , before anybody knew what was happening . The chiefs and all the others just picked up then and left . " " Hunh , " Rion said . He pushed a stool towards Robertson with his foot . Robertson shook his head . " I 'm going to Chota , " he said . " If I can just get to the Carpenter ... " Rion nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anybody . " Robertson picked up his hat from where he had flung it on the table . " Well , you ready to go ? " " Now ? " " Now . They ca n't start anything for three or four days . Takes ' em that long to purify themselves . It ai n't two hundred miles , they say . We got just time enough if we push right along . " Rion got his shot pouch and took his rifle down from the pegs . " I 'll stop by Jacob 's and tell Frank to step up here , " he told Cassy ; then he turned to Robertson . " I 'm ready . "  |p267ROBERTSON  HAD FED his horse before he left home and had a sack ofcorn tied to his saddle rings . ' hey gave Gal ten good ears , then Rion saddled her and they started off . They went up to the head of the Island then took the trail that led along the east bank of the river . The moon was up over the trees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the one they called the Great War Path , the one all the Indians took coming from their towns over in the hills . Rion looked at Robertson . " Reckon we 're likely to meet any of ' em coming along here ? " " Who ? " Robertson said . Rion had turned away but he looked back at the man . Robertson'sold wool hat was clapped on the back of his head so that the brim rode up brash as a rooster 's tail . Under it was a long , calm face that he might have been carrying to meeting . You could n't imagine the expression of Robertson 's face changing , no matter what happened . ' Well , the Lord only knew what was likely to happen on a trip like this . Rion rode a little closer to him . " Indians , " he said . " This is the way they come , ai n't it ? " Robertson glanced to the left where the woods pressed up black . " We could n't make much time traveling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " Rion laughed out . He raised himself stiff-legged in the stirrups the way he used to do long ago and Gal broke into a gallop . Rion let her gallop quite a way before the pulled her up . " I 'm glad we ai n't taking anybody else , " he said when Robertson caught up with him . " Get three men and you got three minds . .. . What you going to say to ' em after you get there ? " " I 'm going to try first off to get to the Carpenter , " Robertson said . " I believe I can make him listen . " " How 'd it happen ? " Rion asked . " How 'd they happen to kill that Indian ? "  | " It was soon after the ball play started . The Crabtree boys was drunk and bragging . That Indian , Lying Fawn they call him , happened to run into one of ' em . " " D' you see it ? " " I was over on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gathering in one place . I pushed in . The Fawn was on the ground , doubled up . All of a sudden he straightened out . I saw where the bullet had gone and I knew it was ten to one it had found the heart . I went hunting for the chiefs . " " What became of the Crabtrees ? " " It was the oldest boy done it . He and the others was to horse and off before folks knew what had happened . . . . I pushed on around the crowd and there was Oconostota and the Carpenter with a lot of their men standing around . I could n't find the linguister or anybody could talk , but I addressed myself to the Carpenter , best I could , making signs ; going on about how sorry I was . He would n't even look at me after the first . Just watched the Fawn . The minute he was dead they said something to the young bucks and they picked him up and started up the trail with him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flung out his hand , and then he and Oconostota went after them . " " If you could have got hold of the linguister you might have done something with ' em . " " I do n't know . They do n't like to be hurried . When one of ' em 's killed they 're going to take time to mourn , no matter what . It do n't do to fool with ' em then . " " I reckon you 're right , " Rion said , noticing how bright the moonlight was on the path . They slept in deep woods that first night but the next day they came out on a savannah . There were mountains in the distance but the path led through a broad valley . Towards evening the mountains closed in , the trace got narrower . A river came dashing down the mountain and flowed beside the path . Robertson called it the Nonachunheh and said the Indians named it that because it laughed so hard . On the evening of the second day they came to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had washed down from the mountainsides . They had no trouble in fording it . The path turned on itself at right angles , went back a way , and there ,  |p269|plain  to see , was the ford . They crossed the river and were about to camp in a cane brake on the other side when Rion said , " Let 's go up the river a piece . " Robertson reminded him that they had only one more feed of corn . " We ai n't likely to find better forage than this . Better let the horses get it while they can . " 1 le waited a second , then he said , " They know we 're coming along here anyway . " They hobbled the horses and turned them loose in the cane . While Rion was handling the horses Robertson had found a place sheltered by a fallen tree . They made a fire and roasted a turkey that Rion had shot that morning . They ate all they could . Robertsonput what was left in his sack . " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better not fire any more shots than we have to . " Rion thought of what Robertson had said before supper . " What makes you think they know we 're coning ? " he asked . " They may not know who it is but they 'll know there are white men on the path . Oconostota 'll have left some men behind to watch . " Rion thought of a party of Indians they had met the first day out . The silent , watchful eyes that never changed their expression all the time Robertson and the trader were talking . Ile and Robertson had fancied they saw a glow in the sky last night . It might have been that very party of Indians kindling a fire up on some bluff . " They had a regular way of sending news by fires . He rose and stamped out the embers of the fire . He had been tired when they stopped but he did not feel sleepy now . He looked at Robertson , wrapping his old cloak around him , ready to lie down for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see what the country 's like , " he told him and took his rifle and walked back towards the river . The land was higher than he had thought . They were camped on a bluff . He pushed through the pines and came out on a big boulder that overhung the river . On his left a stream flowed past the boulder to cascade a hundred feet into the river . He walked to the edge of the rock and stood there and watched the play of the little waterfall . It was only a jet of white at one end of a smooth stretch of water . The river was like a lake here , a long , still pool , almost enclosed by reeds . In the moonlight the water looked black . On the beach at the foot of this bluff he was standing on was a long white something . " Swans , " he thought.  | He thought of his wife . Two nights ago he had been sitting beside her , telling about a place he 'd found on the Holston where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trip , would the news of how they died get back to the folks at home or would they just lie here and nobody even find their bodies ? There was a noise behind him . He whirled , ready to fire , and knocked against Robertson . Robertson laughed and said he was n't as sleepy as he 'd thought he was . They walked along the bluff together . It curved in a little . You could see the swans plain now , a huddle of white a hundred feet below . " Do n't the Indians put swansdown on ' em when they come in peace ? " he asked Robertson . " They make a kind of crown out of the feathers , " Robertson said . " Could n't we do something like that ? To show ' em we 're peacefulwhen we come up to the town ? " " That 's for warriors . But we might make some kind of a sign . " Rion walked to the edge of the bluff and took aim . His shot blasted a swan from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its body tip-tilted at first , then righting itself as the long neck that had been noosed like a vine slowly straightened out . Rion climbed down the side of the bluff and wading into the black water caught the warm , white thing just as it was drifting around the bend . Back at the camp he took his knife and ripped from the body long pieces of skin that were thick with down . He wrapped the pieces of skin around two peeled sticks . When he had finished he took these wands to the branch , washed them free of blood , and held them up for Robertson to see . " There 's your swansdown . Now it 's up to them to recognize their own sign . " All the next day they traveled at the base of a mountain higher than any they 'd seen before . After that they came to a wide valley with another river to cross and then the path began to climb through broken hills . They went up hill and down for a whole day , and late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges . The horses were winded by the last climb . They stopped to rest them and realized as they looked down into the valley that they were at the end of their journey.  |p271There  was a wide plain with a river running through it and on the banks of the river a collection of houses . The woods were thick next to the river but on this side of the houses were open lands . " It looks like a town , with real folks living in it ! " Rion said in surprise . They followed the path down into the valley . The woods stopped at the foot of the hills . " They rode for a while through open lands that were covered with wild grass , and came suddenly on a field planted in corn . The blades were ankle deep , a good stand , but the hills planted so close that they choked each other . There was a young pumpkin vine putting out its leaves at the base of each stalk , and in the vacant space between the rows something else was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to see whether it was beans or more pumpkins when Robertson behind him said , " Hilt ! " Rion straightened up . Over in the middle of the field was a . scaffold built of hickory poles . Sitting on top of it , holding long leafy switches in their hands , were two old women . Their bodies , bare above the waist , were the thinnest Rion had ever seen . " They held their wizened faces perfectly still , but their black eyes flickered over Robertson , over Rion , and away from them to the village . The next instant they had slid from the scaffold and were off through the corn rows . Rion laughed . " They look like old grapes , " he said , " old dried-up fox grapes . Reckon that 's why they put them out here , to dry in the sun ? " " They 're out here to scare the deer off , " Robertson said , " but I wish they had n't a been . They 're in the town by this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white wand out and was holding it up before him , stiff as a poker . Rion did the same . They rode slowly through the field and up to the first house . There were two of them , set almost opposite each other , square cribs but with the logs standing on end instead of supporting each other . Between them a lane opened up . On each side of it were more houses with garden patches beside them . An Indian was coming out of the first house , a tall , stronglookingfellow with nothing on but a breech clout . He was stoopingto get through the low doorway and his eyes were on the ground.  | When he straightened up Rion and Robertson were halting their horses in front of him . He glanced at them and then he looked away to the hills they had just come out of , as if those hills could tell him who they were . Robertson held his wand up and shook it towards the Indian and said some word he 'd learned from them , coupling it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said and shook his wand again . The chief 's name seemed to bring the Indian to . He ran his tongue over his lips and stepped towards them and began to talk , so fast that Rion thought they could n't have understood him even if they 'd known the language . " He 's asking something , " Robertson said . " Look out ! " Rion said and pointed up the street . A rabble was heading towards them , a few men in front and behind them a lot of women and children . Robertson leaned towards the Indian . " Take us to Atta Kulla Kulla , " he said , loud and sharp . The Indian gave him a quick look , then grasped his bridle rein and began to lead the horse up the street . Robertson turned and gave Rion a look over his shoulder . Rion smiled . Robertson was rattled , afraid this Indian would take him off by himself . Rion whipped up his own horse and pressed close behind them . They were heading straight for the mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side and came up to the Indian who was leading the horse . He stopped and said something , then started on again . The two men fell in with him and the mob closed in behind . Rion looked down and saw at his stirrup a boy 's thin face and staring eyes . He drew his foot back as if he might dig the child in the ribs . The child laughed but his laughter was cut short by a hand that fell on his shoulder and dragged him back into the crowd . " Do n't tease ' em , " Robertson said in a low voice . They turned down a lane where the houses were even thicker . In some of the yards women were cooking over open fires . They stared at the procession . A few joined it but most of them stayed where they were , staring . They took another turn . The Indian stopped and pointed to where a glow came from behind a clump of linden trees . Robertson was getting down off his horse , falling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob fell back . Rion followed Robertson up a little rise . There was a house behind the clump of trees . The glow came from a fire outside . Women were cooking around it . There was a bearskin spread on the ground . The old , yellow chief was lounging on it . A naked child , four or five years old , was sitting beside him . As Rion and Robertson came up the rise the chief reached over and with his left hand tumbled and touselled the child as if he had been a puppy or a kitten . The child 's cries were still in the air as the two white men went towards him . Robertson walked to within a few feet of where the chief was lying and stopped and said his name . The chief got to his feet and came towards them . The child ran after him and , wanting to play sonic more , tugged at his hand . He took his hand away and , laying it for a minute on the child 's head , stepped away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then his face tightened up and he did not say anything more . Robertson went towards him , saying the word for friend and brother and holding out his hand . The chief did not take Robertson'shand and draw him to him , the way they usually did . Instead he began talking in a high voice , waving his hands to and fro . Robertson put on a sad look and brought his hands , one of them still holding the white wand , up in front of him , and then let them fall away quick to his sides to show how bad he felt not to understand . Then he called the name of the man who had linguisted for them at the Island . The chief shook his head and took his two hands and threw them before him in a sort of galloping motion . " He means he 's ridden off somewhere , " Rion whispered . The chief looked at him hard ; then he looked down at the ground as if he were trying to make up his mind . Finally he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She started off down the street . Robertson came over and stood beside Rion . There was sweat on his forehead and his voice was hoarse as if he had been talking a long time . " If he 's this hard to handle I do n't know what we 'll do with Oconostota , " he whispered.  | Rion felt that the old chief could read their minds even if he did n't understand what they were saying . " Do n't try to talk to him any more , " he said . " He 's sent for a linguister . Wait till he gets here . " " There he comes now , " Robertson said . " White man , ai n't it ? " Rion did not answer . He was staring at the man who was steppingup into the yard . As naked as an Indian and as red , with his head shaved back to the scalp lock and silver rings hanging heavy from his ears . He came on up to them . The light from the fire was on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Archy Outlaw . "  |p275As  THEY MADE their way through the crowd Rion put his hand up and pulled at the collar of his shirt . The leather seemed to have stiffened and no wonder , being out in the wet so much  --  or was it that his neck was bigger than usual ? The last few hours he had felt as if a band was around his throat , not tight enough to choke him but there at the base of his throat ready to he drawn tight . The feelinghad come over him when Archv stepped up into that yard and it had stayed with him all through supper . The Indian woman had given them some sort of boiled bread , made out of beans and potatoes . Robertson kept saying it was the best thing he ever tasted . I le , Rion , had taken a piece in his hand and was about to lute into it when that feeling came over him , and he had to lay it down . Robertson noticed , and whispered to him that he 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the meat then but it was all he could do to get it down , first time in his life he 'd ever felt that way at table  --  if you could call a bearhide spread on the ground a table . Their guards  --  they had one apiece %ere stooping in the midst of a cleared circle , before a reed couch spread with skins . Robertsonwas sitting down . Rion did the same . The guards stepped away . Robertson turned his head long enough to whisper : " You notice they did n't give us anything to drink ? " Rion nodded . Both white men faced towards the town house . It was built on a little rise so that the chiefs who sat on the scats placed against its long east wall were up above the rest of the people . The old Carpenter sat on the white scat , being peace chief . A few feet away from him was the war chief , Oconostota , on a chair as red as madder . There was another chief , head over all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was away on a hunt and that big , pockmarkedyoung chief who had been at the Island that day was with him . The Indians standing behind Rion and Robertson pressed up , so close that one of them pushed against Rion 's shoulder . You could hear them shuffling back , laughing and whispering . It gave a man a strange feeling to have that many of them there at his back even if they were n't doing anything more than mocking him . He had caught one of them at that on the way over here . A long , tall devil , supple as a piece of whang leather . He had suddenly whipped off that piece of cloth he had tied about him and tied it on again , making a pair of breeches the way children might do . After he got them fixed he went straddling along stiff-legged as a goat with his head up in the air . The others howled like wolves . Even Robertson laughed . " They do n't believe in a man tying up his arse , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as small as a child up there on his high white seat , the eagle feathers that he held in his lap covering all his feet and legs . The other chief , Oconostota , had a fan of the same feathers in his lap . He was the fiercer looking of the two , being over six feet tall , with the longest head Rion had ever seen on any man . But he did not have the power over the people that the Carpenter had  --  unless , Robertson said , somebody struck the war pole . Everything would be given over into his hands then . The thing was to keep it from coming to that . That was what Robertson had been working for all the time he had been talking to Archy . Rion felt suddenly as if he could n't sit still . He got to his feet . Robertson turned his head quickly and gave him a look . " What you doing ? " " I just thought I 'd stand up a while . " " Sit down , " Robertson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now . " Rion sat down . A ring of Indians was crowding up at the corner of the town house . He let his eyes travel over them and then on to the fire that blazed up at the right of where the chiefs sat . It was moonlight but they had kindled a fire just the same . It made the whole square as light as day . He looked back into the crowd . They were not all Indians . A white face every now and then . Traders . They looked away the minute they knew you were looking at them . There was one white man taller than any of the others . A blackhairedfellow , leaning against a tree and wearing a blue , frogged coat with an officer 's scarlet hat cocked on his head . He kept his arms folded and looked off over the crowd as if he was not much interested in what was going on.  |p277An  Indian came out from the town house , carrying a bearskin . He laid it down on the ground in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , looking down at the skin . Another Indian was coming up . He was carrying a gun and a round whitish stone . He laid the things down on the bearskin and stepped around to where the other Indian stood . They went off together . Big , strong-looking bucks , picked probablybecause they looked alike , walking off side by side , their arms , even the feathers in their scalp locks , swinging at the same slant . Rion watched the firelight lick up the naked thigh that was nearest him and thought that no matter how big they were or how strong , there was always " something womanish looking about them . " What did they lay that white rock down there for ? " he asked Robertson . " It 's a chungke stone , what they play ball with . " Robertson half raised himself from the couch , then fell back . " Those are the things belonged to Lying Fawn , I reckon . " 1 le gave a sigh . " Well , they got to go through the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck who was coming up to stand in front of the chiefs . Greased all over and his head shaved . Silver rings in his ears , a shell gorget on his breast , and nothing else on but a breech clout . He turned his head a little to one side . There was a feather stuck through his scalp lock . That meant that he was one of their fighting men . Archy stood with his face turned half to the chiefs and half to the people . There was the same look on his face that he had had this evening when he stepped up into that yard and the light fell on him and Rion knew that he had found his brother here among these Indians . He had jumped over a baby that was crawling between his legs . " Archy ! " he cried and his arm was out and over the boy 's back . " Archy ! " he cried and remembered now the feeling of his hand on the naked back as he drew the boy to him . But Archy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robertson saw that something was up before Rion did . He said , " Listen to him , Outlaw ! " and Rion listened and felt Archy 's eyes on him hard as flint , though he was smiling . " Do n't tell ' em I 'm your brother . Make out you know me , all right , but do n't tell ' em I 'm your brother . "  | Rion had looked away without saying anything . The old chief came up . Archy spoke to him . The old chief made a sound like a clucking hen or like women being polite at meeting . Then Archy turned back and began talking again , asking questions about the folks , pleasant , laughing , and all the time holding him off with his eyes . At the last he had said , sticking it in with some linguisting , " Do n't you try to see me . I 'll fix it so we can get together . " " Things were mixed up enough without this , " Robertson said when he was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of his life ? " Robertson shook his head . " I 'll go as far as the next man to help him get out , but one thing at a time I always say . We got enough on our hands . " " I ai n't going out of this town without him , " Rion said . " All right , " Robertson said , " but do n't do anything brash . You heard what he said ? " " I heard what he said , " Rion told him , " and I saw him too . All fixed up like a raree show . Turned my stomach . " " Well , a man lands in one of these towns he 's got to do the best he can , " Robertson said . That had been three or four hours ago . Rion and Robertson had not been alone together since then . Under guard every minute , even when they were sitting at supper with the old chief . The old chief had thawed a little while they were eating supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lying Fawn , but of course it would all depend on what was said at the council . .. . A big Indian was coming up to where the bearskin lay . He picked the gun up in one hand and the chungke stone in the other , and walked out in front of the chiefs . " That 's the Raven of Chota , " Robertson whispered . " He 's nephew to the war chief . " The Raven called the Lying Fawn 's name , and leaned over and with the barrel of his gun slowly made marks on the ground ; he rose , looking at Archy . Archy faced around towards the crowd . " Ten winters , " he said . " He was ten winters drilling his stone and polishing it but he will not be at the ball play again . His chungke stone goes to his son .... " A boy came leaping out of the crowd , moaning . The Raven handed the stone to him ; then turning to the crowd , he talked wildly ,  |p279shaking  the gun at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had been running a mile . Archy 's voice might have come out of the man 's own mouth . " This gun is burning in my hand and I know that your guns are burning too . " A yell rose , as strange a sound as Rion had ever heard in his life . It came from the Fawn 's son . Rion could see the boy 's mouth , still open , but the sound seemed to conic from far off , from somebody walking by himself in the forest . It died . Other mouths opened . It rose again but now it did not seem far off but as if the man was coming towards you . " Gr't God ! " Robertson said under his breath . Rion kept his eyes on Archy . " Do n't he know he 's working ' em up ? " " He has to tell ' em what 's said . There 's traders here know English . " Robertson drew a long breath . " I ' God he 's going to talk now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid his eagle feathers down on the chair and walked out towards the crowd . I le stood a minute , looking at them and then he smiled , a kind of pitying smile . " You say that your guns are burning in your hands . That is always the way with brave young men . But the gun can speak only one word . It can not even tell you which way it wants to send the bullet . Are you sure that these guns burn to send bullets against the white men ? Remember that it was our white brothers gave us these guns . Will these guns turn against their fathers ? It may be that they burn to send bullets against the Creeks . " He was still smiling and his black eyes were wide open and glisteningthe way they had been that day at the island . All the time Archy was linguisting he kept those black , shining eyes on the crowd . When Archy stopped speaking he turned them suddenly on Robertson . Robertson was on his feet , speaking in a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that killed the Lying Fawn were no friends of ours . Rascals . If we had known what was toward we 'd have barred them from the play . " There was a long silence . The Raven stood there , his hands hanging at his sides , his eyes on the ground . Robertson looked around him . None of the Indians looked back at him . They all kept their eyes on the ground . That seemed to rattle Robertson . He took a step towards the Carpenter . " We 're done now , " Rion thought , " He 's lost his head . " But the Carpenter was shifting his stance . His left foot , going back , put a pace between him and Robertson . That seemed to bring Robertson to . His face changed . His right hand swept back to point to the path over the hills . " We have come from a far river to talk to our brothers about this mistake that has been made . Would we have come all this way if our hearts had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Raven . His voice was stony , his look sad . " The Lying Fawn was a brave warrior but he did not fall in the fight . He fell , visiting friends , before he even had time to be weighed on the Path . " Robertson was going to answer but the chief spoke : " Our white brother does not speak with a snake 's tongue . It is true that the Lying Fawn is gone and gone before he had time to be weighed on the Path , but many a brave man has gone the same way . Last winter Round 0 , one of our bravest young men , fell from a big rock and his body was broken in pieces . It was not Round 0 's heart failed him . It was his foot slipped . So with our white brothers . Their hearts are right towards us . It was the foot that slipped ... " The Raven looked at the peace chief and then he looked up at his uncle . The war chief had moved while the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring off over the crowd as if what was going on was no concern of his . The Raven looked back at the Carpenter and then cast his eyes sullenly on the ground . The Carpenter waited a second and spoke again : " Blood has been spilled on the path but it has been covered up . These two white men , our brothers , came along the path and found the blood there and kneeled down and covered it up with their hands . It is all covered up now . . . . We shall not even look where it lies . " He was walking back to his seat , turning his back on them as if there was nothing more to say . Robertson was sitting down beside Rion . Rion laid his hand on his knee . " I believe that fixed ' em , " he whispered . " I do n't know , " Robertson said . He leaned forward to peer around the corner of the town house . When he looked back at Rion his long face was split in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're fixing to drink with us ! " GREEN CENTURIES 281p281They sat there and waited while two Indians came stepping up and waved fans of eagle feather over their heads . After that they were led up to where the chiefs were sitting . A seat covered with some white stuff was brought out of the town house and set between the two chiefs . They sat there and drank the black drink out of big conch shells , and after that they ate some more and there was dancing . Late at night they were taken to the cabin where they were to sleep . Half a dozen young bucks went with them , carrying guns , and fastened the door of the cabin after them . They had been in there only a few minutes when the door was unfastened and a man stepped into the room . It was the man Rion had noticed wearing an officer 's hat and leaning against a tree . His name was Captain Nat Gist , he said . He had come to take Rion to his brother.  |p282RION  WANTED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better not . He 'd only asked for one of the white men . " I told ' em we wanted to talk over old times . Old friends , I told ' em , raised in the same town . " " Go on , " Robertson said . " Do n't pay any attention to me . Go on. , , Rion looked at the man and decided to trust him . They went outside . The Indians lying on the ground before the cabin rose up as they passed , then sank down again without saying anything . " I told ' em I 'd be responsible for getting you back inside an hour , " Gist said . Rion did not say anything . They walked on down the street and came to a house that sat off a little from the others . Rion noticed a wild plum thicket growing up at the back of it . Gist stood back . Rion went inside . Archy was there . Rion went to him and catching him by the elbows half lifted him from the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed out as he broke away from him . " I did n't know what to do when I came up in the yard and saw you standing there , " he said , " and then I remembered they could n't understand , no matter what we said . " He sat down on a bench that was placed against the wall . Rion sat down beside him , looking around as he did so . There was furniture in the room . A chest over against the far wall and in that same corner a couch with skins piled on it . There was another smaller piece of furniture that he could n't make out beside the couch . This must be a summer house for there was no chimney to be seen anywhere . He realized suddenly that there was no window either but there was not much need for one . No chinking between any of the logs . The moonlight lay in broad stripes all over the floor.  |p283He  looked at Archy . " You got your own house ? " he asked . Archy was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logs . He had his head tilted to one side , studying Rion 's face . " Yes , " he said ; and then , " you ai n't changed much , Rion . " Rion laughed . " It ai n't been so long as all that . " " No , " Archy said , " it ai n't been so long . " Rion tried to think back to the day Archy had been lost . He could remember searching all that night and the next day and then the long days after that when they were gradually giving up hope , but he could not remember the moment when they first knew the boy was gone . " How 'd they get hold of you ? " he asked . " It was when we came down on to that savannah . Remember ? I was ahead of the rest . I came up to that creek and found buffalo trace and started up the other side . " " And they was waiting there to get you ? " " I ran into ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ... " They good to you ? " Archy raised his head and looked Rion full in the eyes . " Like I was one of them , " he said . There was a sudden sharp , querulous sound from the corner of the room . Rion did not know what it was at first . He saw that what had seemed a heap of skins there on the couch was raising itself . A girl , half naked , with long black hair hanging loose around her shoulders . She sat up on the couch , leaned over , and with her foot rocked the log cradle that was setting in front of her . " That your woman ? " Rion asked . Archy said " Yes , " then called out something to her in Cherokee . She answered and kept on rocking the cradle with her foot . But the baby that was in the cradle would not be quiet . " I'hc woman finally took him up and held him in her arms , patting him on the hack . " Maybe he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Cassy used to hold Malcolm up to her shoulder and pat the wind out of him after each meal . Archy did not answer . After a minute he said , " You ever heard anything from the folks ? "  | Rion shook his head . " Nobody 's coming through from that way . But the country 's settling up fast , I tell you . " " Where did you settle ? " Archy asked . " On the lower Holston . Not far from the Long Island . I got me two acres cleared already and a house built . I 'll make two hundred bushel of corn this year if the varmints do n't get it . Pretty good garden patch too . " " How 's Cassy ? " Archy asked . " Tolerable . We 've got a boy . Born last January . " " What 'd you name him ? " " Malcolm , after the old man , " Rion said . He did not say that Cassy had wanted to name him Archy . They had almost quarreled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rion had said at the last . " You reckon I want to hear him called a dozen times a day : Archy ! Archy ! Archy ! ' " and he had got up and left the house and flung off into the woods . He looked over at the woman and the baby on the couch . " How old 's that one ? " " Near a year old . " " What you call him ? " " The Fox . But he 'll have three or four names before he 's done , " Archy said wearily . " All of their names mean something ? " " Most of ' em . " The woman suddenly laughed ; she called out something and set the baby on the floor . " What 's she say ? " Rion asked curiously . " Says it 's too light in here for him to sleep . " The baby was crawling towards them . When he was halfway there Archy picked him up and sat down again . The baby dug his toes into Archy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught at the feather that was stuck through his hair . Rion looked away from them . " You been here nearly three years , " he said . " Did n't you ever try to run off ? " " Once . They 'd taken my gun but I started out with a knife I stole . I was out in the woods four days . Nothing to eat but a rabbit I brought down with the knife . " " So you come on back ? " " I run into a hunting party . I come on home with them . "  |p285The  baby was squirming in Archy 's hold . Archy leaned over and put him on the floor . As he was crawling off he set his hand on Rion 's moccasin , then as if realizing that the foot was strange to him he tilted his little head and looked up . Rion held himself still and looked down at him . The little round face was topped by coarse dark hair . In this light his eyes looked black too , but you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brown as Archy 's . The hand was lifted . The baby was crawling off . Rion eased his breath out and turned to Archy . " This Captain Gist that brought Inc over here , can you depend on him ? " Archy did not answer for a minute ; then lie said : " I ai n't ever had much to do with him but they say he 's a stout man and knows the woods as well as any white man in the Nation . " " He looks like he could fight if it came to that , " Rion said . " The question is , would he stand by you ? " " How you mean ? " " Would he help you get away from here ? " Rion said sharply . " You been here three years now . You want to stay here the rest of your life ? " Archy did not answer . " Well , " Rion said , " what you think ? " Still Archy did not answer . Rion turned away from him and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch was staring at him but he did not pay any attention to her . Finally he stopped in front of Archy . " All right then , if you do n't want to take ( list in on it . I do n't trust " ( he did not realize until afterwards what he had said ) , " I do n't trust a squaw man anyhow . We can manage by ourselves . Just us two 'll be best . There 's a thicket grows right up to the back of your house here . A man could hide in that . " I lc went over and ran his whole arm and shoulder into an aperture between the logs ; then he was back before Archy . " Well , what say ? " Archy got to his feet . He put his hand on Rion 's arm . " We could n't get out of here tonight . There 's a man watching every brake . " He was whispering . It suddenly occurred to Rion that the woman on the couch might have learned some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low tone . " How you want to go about it ? "  | Archy walked over to a bench just inside the door . There was a jug sitting on the bench with a long-necked gourd lying beside it . Archy dipped down into the jug and brought the gourd up full . " Want a drink ? " Rion shook his head . Archy drank his dipper off , then put it back in its place . " You go on back with Gist , " he said . " And in the morning you and Robertson start off , just like you had n't seen me . I 'll catch up with you. , , " How 'll you get away ? " Archy shook his head and smiled . There was an expression on his face Rion had seen often , when Archy was a boy and would slip off to the swimming hole to get out of work , and then when he came back to the field try to act as if he never had been gone , or when their father would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoes in the field or the pasture bars down . A sly one Archy had always been and slyer than ever since living with these Indians . But probably his way was the best , to slip out of town by himself and join them on the trail after they were out of sight of the town . .. . There was a knocking at the door , not loud but prolonged . " All right , " Rion called . He struck Archy lightly on the shoulder . " Goodnight , boy . You be careful . " " Goodnight , " Archy said and followed him through the door . He was still there , a long , black shadow beside the door when Rion looked back just before rounding the bend in the path.  |p287Rion  TRIED to talk to the white man , Gist , on his way back to their prison . But Gist would not talk , except about the settlements on the Watauga and the Holston . He was curious to know about them , how many head of people there were , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western waters . " They 'll stay if the Indians do n't run ' cm off , " Rion told him . " The head men here are willing for ' cm to stay , " Gist said . " They signed to that , did n't they ? " " They made their mark on it , " Rion said , " but that ai n't saying they 'll keep their word . " Gist was ahead of him on the path . He turned around . " The Cherokees think a lot of their word , " he said , " specially the head men . I never knew ' em to break it . " I lc was silent a minute , and then he said , " Of course the agent may not think the way they do about the settlers staying . After all , the law saes for ' COI to remove . " " We got a law of our own now on the Holston , " Rion told him . " We may choose to go by our law instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent 's law . It 's His Majesty 's government . " " His Majesty ai n't ever been on this side of the water . He do n't even know how much land there is . Looks to me like he ai n't got no right to say who shall settle where , when there 's land enough to go around . " Gist turned around again and looked at him . " You 're talking treason , ai n't you ? " " Maybe so . You come to the Watauga or the Holston and you 'll hear a lot of the same talk . " They were at the cabin . Rion told the captain that he was much obliged to him , and stepped inside without offering to shake hands . A minute later he heard the bolt shut and knew they were shut in for the night . Robertson was . kneeling by the chimney that went up in the middle of the room , holding his gun in his hand . " I thought I better not go to sleep , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ' em on the roof . " Rion stooped and thrust his head up the chimney . It was ill made and very small . The scrap of starlight that he could see was no larger than a man 's hand . " I do n't believe a man could get down it , " he said . " Maybe they was just up there spying on us . " " Maybe , " Robertson said , " but we better not go to sleep at the sane time . You go over and lay down . I 'll watch awhile . " " I do n't feel like sleeping , " Rion said . " You lay down first . " Robertson went over to the couch and lay down . Rion squatted down near the chimney . He wondered what time it was and concluded that it must be after midnight . For a while there had been yelling and singing off towards the square but that had quieted down . There was no sound to be heard at all now except night noises , the cry of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wind . Of course that owl he 'd just heard hooting might be one Indian signalling to another . They could imitate any sound in the woods he 'd heard . He looked around him watchfully . The moon was waning , but there was still light enough to see everything in the room . The bed Robertson was sleeping on was made out of stout pieces of cane ; buffalo tugs threaded through the hollowsheld the pieces of cane together . A nice piece of work . He had thought that these Indians lived like beasts of the wood , but they had houses like everybody else , only everything was different from the way a white man would have it , this chinmey here in the middle of the floor instead of going up outside the wall the way a Christian would have it . There was a neat little out-house at the back of Archy 's cabin . A hen-house ; he had heard the chickens cra-aking as they came up the path . Archy had accumulated as much gear as he had in these three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . He ought not to have said that about not trusting a squaw man , but that was what Archy was . It was too bad he 'd been here long enough to get him a woman and father a child , but it was to be expected . The traders all had Indian wives . The boy had gone on and done like the rest without thinking much about it . He 'd always been one to go with the crowd , not taking any thought of who he was or what his folks stood for . . . . That time on the way home from church , rolling around in the leaves with Lessie Robinson . Thep289boy might have got mixed up with that trash for life if he , Rion , had n't come along . He thought of Gassy and became excited imagining how it would be when they got home : he and Robertson coming up the path and Cassy standing in the door and seeing the man with them and maybe not being able to make out who it was . Let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger surprise than she would have then . They must put a shirt on him , cover up that paint and those pictures , a deer it looked like , pricked into hint with gun-powder . Something fell on the roof with a plop . I le was on his feet and then he realized what it was : an acorn dropping . That was what Robertson had heard when he thought somebody was scampering on the roof . He , Rion , had been sitting here all night ready to fire against the acorns dropping off the trees ! The noise had waked Robertson . Ile was coating over . " Here , you lay down awhile . I 've had a good sleep . " " All right , " Rion said and went over and lay down on the couch . He closed his eyes and for awhile could think of nothing but the moment when he got home , and the folks would look out and see that he had Archy with him . The vision grew less bright each time he summoned it and finally faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his bed . He told himself that he would not let them keep him awake and shut his eyes and , grasping his rifle firmly in his right hand , turned on his side and went to sleep . Robertson woke him at daylight to tell him that a lot of Indians were heading for the cabin . They were the guards of the night before , come to take them to the Carpenter 's house . A fire was going in the same place there under the linden trees and women were cooking around it . Archy was not there . The white man , John Vann , who had been with the Carpenter when Rion first saw hint at the Long Island , acted as linguister . He came and stood beside them as they ate , and asked about the settlements on the Watauga and the Holston . Robertson told him that he did not get around much and could not say how many settlers there were or where they carte from . The man laughed . " This is a long trip for you then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " Robertson told him . The old Carpenter was getting on his horse , said he would ride290 GREEN CENTURIESp290with them a way . Rion wondered whether Archy knew that they would have an escort out of town and decided that he probably did . That might be the reason that he did not appear at breakfast . He might have gone on ahead , might even now be at the place where they would meet . They rode out of town the same way they had come in . The Carpenter had a dozen young bucks with him . They wanted to go on farther but he would not let them . When he was ready to go back he got down off his horse and came over to Rion and Robertson and " took them by the arm , " as the Indians put it , and said that they were his friends and brothers and his heart would always be straight towards them . When they looked back , after entering the open lands , they could still see him , sitting there on his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till we 're clean out of sight , " Robertson said . " It do n't make much difference , " Rion said . " I 've an idea Archy 's on ahead . " " He wo n't have a horse . " " He might . If he do n't we can ride and tie . " As they rode on they looked around , wondering where Archy could be hid . There was not much cover . A big oak here and there or a wild plum thicket , but for the most part the land was covered with wild grass . It was waist high in some places . A man could lie hid in it but he could not hide his horse . Rion looked off to the right and saw , where the road took a bend , an out-cropping of rock , one big boulder , with half a dozen smaller ones scattered around it . " He could hide there , " he said . They rode on . When they were almost level with the rocks a man stepped out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier built than Archy , wearing an officer 's hat . " I 've a message for you , Master Outlaw , from your brother . He says for you to go on ahead . " " Go on ahead ? What 's he mean ? Ai n't he coming too ? " " He ca n't get away . " Rion rode over closer to the man . " Has something gone wrong ? " " Not that I know of . " " Well , why' n't he come then ? " " He said for you to go on ahead . " Rion turned around and glared at Robertson . " I ai n't going with/out him , " he said . " You can go on by yourself if you want . I 'm going back . " Captain Gist had sat down on a rock and was studying the toe of his moccasin . He looked up . " I would n't go back if I was you . " " Why not ? There 's a linguister there can talk for me . Archy can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you any good . " " That old yellow chief . I 'll put a huller in him . " " And git yourself and me killed too , " Robertson murmured . " Shut up ! " Rion said . " It ai n't your brother . " Captain Gist stood up . " It wo n't do any good to talk to the Carpenter . He ca n't make your brother come . " Rion slowly lowered his eyes to the ground . In the silence he could hear Robertson 's horse tearing away at the grass ; then Robertsongave a sigh . Gist took a step towards Rion . " Any message you want to send ? " Rion raised his head . The two men watching hits were startled to see how in those few seconds the blood had risen in his checks until the whole face was swollen up to the eve-lids . He fixed his shining , red-brown eyes on Gist . " No , " he said . A curious expression came on Gist 's face . He was about to turn away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard , " he said softly . " There 's many a man conies here to the Nation and stays awhile and do n't want to leave . " Rion looked at the man as if he were surprised to find him still there . " Hanh ? " he said , and when he found Gist 's black eyes still fixed on him he made a weary gesture with his hand . " No , " he said again , " there ai n't any message . "  |p292CASSY  'S SECOND CHILD was born that summer , a girl whom theynamed Sarah for Rion 's mother . Rion worked harder than usual that fall , clearing another quarter of an acre and building a crib to hold his corn . He also built Jocasta a hen-house , for she had got a setting of eggs from Charles Robertson 's wife early in the spring and now had a small flock of chickens . Charles Robertson often came by the Outlaws on his way to the store in Carter 's valley . He was more of a talker than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass the time of day and tell the news over his way . There were neighbors to visit now if a man wanted to spend his time gadding . Two families had settled across the river from Rion 's place . One family had a parcel of children . The other family consisted of a middle-aged man and his sister . He was a fiddler . Some said he had kept school and would like to keep one again if he could find scholars . Cassy did n't like his looks and said that she did n't know that she 'd want Malcolm or Sarah to be under him . Rion laughed at that . Sarah had n't begun to notice yet and Malcolm would n't be learning his AB-Abs for many a day yet and when he did would n't need to go from home with a schoolmaster right in the house . Gassy said that if there was a school Frank ought to keep it . He was the most learned man on the waters anywhere around . Charles Robertson said there was no doubt of that but added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters busy , the way the country was settling up . That was in January . It was the hour of the noon-day rest , an unseasonably warm day . They were all out in the dooryard , Gassy on the steps , the men sitting on up-ended chunks of wood when Charles Robertson came up the path and sat down among them . He sat down , facing the river . " I declare , " he said , " I can see the water shining through them leaves . " " We been noticing that ever since the last clearing , " Cassy told him .  |p293Charles  turned to her . His broad Irish face was solemn ; then he grinned , the way a man does when he has news he is anxious to tell . " You clear out a few more trees and you can see the road , " he said . " I 'd be feared to , " Rion told him . " It might hurt my eyes , watchingall them carriages go past . " A robin that had stayed the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piped a few sharp notes . They looked up and saw the bare bough the bird perched on with the other black boughs crowding against it and thought of all the wintry skeletons that lay between them and their old homes , and they laughed . Charles Robertson laughed loudest of all , and nervously , then suddenly leaned forward , looking at Rion . " You 'll live to see wagons , and plenty of ' em , going through this valley , " he said . Rion said : " . I come of long-lived folks but ai n't none of ' em lived to be old as Methuselah yet . " But his eyes rested on Charles ' face speculatively . Charles jumped up and came towards hint . " There 's a road going to be cut at the head of the Long island . I talked to the men who 're going to cut it . " " And who be they ? " " They 's twenty or thirty of ' cm , from North Carolina . They stopped by James ' place yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Henderson . . . " Rion said . " 1 used to know a judge Hendersonin Carolina . Dick Henderson he was . " " Richard Henderson and Company , " Charles said . " There 's nine in the company , but this Judge I Henderson he 's top bear dog . He 's a going to buy up the whole country , done already traded with the Indians for it , and now he 's sent some men on ahead to cut a road . " " What country is it he 's got hold of ? " Rion asked . He suddenly sat up straighter . " It better not he any of the land around here , after all the trouble James and me had fixing things up with the Cherokee . " " It 's far above the Island , " Charles said , " what they call the Kentuck . All the country between the Louisa and the Shawano . He 's done already traded with the Indians for it .

" Charlotte says James had better hurry up and get him some learning now he 's hearing from all these big men . " " How 's he getting along with his learning ? " Cassy asked . " He 's clean through the primer and reading some in the Bible now . Every night he writes up two whole sheets of foolscap . A fair letter he wrote the other night , Charlotte said . Next time he gets a letter she 's going to let him answer it himself . " " I tried to learn once , " Rion said absently . " Went to Frank here a whole winter but it never done me no good . . . . How come all these big men writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he done , him and you . News of it had got down to Charleston , through the Indians , I reckon . Judge Henderson he 'd heard all about it , and said in his letter that the Watauga men ought to be proud to have James living amongst them . He did n't say anything about you . Do n't reckon he knew you were along . " " I did n't do any of the talking , " Rion said . He was silent a moment ; then : " You say you seen these men are going to cut the road for Henderson 's company ? " " There 's twenty or thirty of ' em , mostly from Rutherford . Man named Boone at the head of ' em . He 's been through here before . You know him ? " " Aye , " Rion said . " I knew him too . In Carolina . " He rose and picked up his axe . " I better be getting back to work , " he said , but after he had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daniel Boone , still going to Kentuck ! " " I never thought he 'd come through here , " Cassy said . " It 's on the way , " Rion said . " That fine grazing country he used to talk of lies up here above the Island , from all folks tell me . " He glanced at Cassy . She 'd been as excited as the rest while Robertson was telling his news but now she looked sad as if , lonesome as she was , she was sorry to hear about the country opening up . He walked over and laid his hand on her hair . " What you so down in the mouth for ? " She turned her face up to his and she smiled . " I was thinkingp295about the folks that 'll be coming , on the road , only there ai n't no road , camping every night and moving on the next day . It 's a hard way to live . " " Well , they can go on past , " he said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied . " She kept her face turned up while her eyes searched his . " No , " she said , " not if we 're satisfied . "  |p296DURING  the next few months the people living on the waters of the lower Holston heard a great deal about Richard Henderson and Company 's Purchase . The deeds were not signed yet , but Judge Henderson had interviewed all the influential chiefs and had their word . The Little Carpenter had even made a trip to Cross creek with Henderson to see the goods that were to be traded for the lands . Two houses full . The Carpenter 's wife had gone with him to inspect the goods on behalf of the women . Both the chief and his wife had seemed to be satisfied with what was offered . The Carpenter , the Old Tassel , Oconostota and other important chiefs were to come to the Watauga in the spring to sign the treaty . Henderson was offering liberal terms to men who were willing to go out and settle the new country . Every man who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up five hundred acres of land for himself and two hundred and fifty acres for each tithable person whom he should take with him , on the payment of twenty shillings sterling per hundred and an annual quit rent of two shillings per hundred . The Outlaws , sitting before the fire at night , talking , sometimes saw themselves in imagination settled in the new country . " Five hundred acres of land , " Rion said . " If we sold out everythingwe got here we could get up enough to pay the tax . " " We could take up seven hundred and fifty acres , you and me together , " Frank reminded him . " Nigh on to a thousand acres of rich land . Maybe we ought to go . " " There may be some catch , " Jocasta said . " This Judge Henderson , he may not do all he promises . " " Dick Henderson 's an honest man , " Rion said , " though a lawyer . " " How 'd he git around the law ? I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Indians . " " He 's got a decision of the Lord Chancellor 's , " Frank said . " Thep297Lord Chancellor held that when countries are acquired from Indian princes the property rights arc vested in the grantee by the nature of the grant itself . . . . I saw it copied out in the last letter Robertsonhad . " Cassy laughed . Rion shook his head . " You 'd a been a big man , Frank , if you 'd stayed in the old country . Would you mind saying that again ? " Frank repeated what he had said . Rion looked into the fire . " I reckon what it means is that you and me ca n't patent three hundred acres from these Indians , but a man can make a deal with ' em for twenty million . " " I do n't believe the decision hold , " Frank said . " It goes against the proclamation of ' 63 . " " I wish I could get hold of Daniel Boone , " Rion said . " He 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , James Robertson looks to he Hendcrson 's right-hand man in these parts , " Frank said . " I reckon we can find out from him ... . When you reckon Charles 'll be up this way again ? " They did not see either Charles or James Robertson for several months . But Amos Eaton made a trip to the Watauga and came back with word that the treaty was to he held the middle of March , within a mile of Charles Robertson 's station , right on the river , at the place they called the Sycamore Shoals . Daniel Boone was not there now but had been in and out several times . The Indians were already gathering . Two or three hundred fighting men and a sprinkling of women and children . The company had undertaken to feed them all . A score of hunters were in the woods , but they were not bringing in much game . Henderson would have to have beef and corn , too , if he fed all those Indians . The word had gone around and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking of driving his two steers down . James Robertson had sent Rion a message by Amos . This was the chance for the South Holston men . Buy their land outright from the Indians at the same time that Henderson was making his great purchase . If the Indians would sign one deed they 'd sign the other . Judge Henderson , who was as clever a man as you 'd find , though a lawyer , was drawing up the deed . Charles Robertson was to be trusteeand already had two thousand pounds worth of goods contractedp298for Rion could come in with the others on payment of twenty shillings . " I ai n't got twenty shillings , " Rion said . " There 's the bull calf , " Cassy reminded him . " They ai n't no question but that you can sell him , " Amos said . " Henderson 's going to be put to it to feed ' cm . There 's Indians coming in every day . They look for a thousand before they 're through . " " I reckon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They started Wednesday , two days before the treaty was to begin , but had bad luck on the way with the cattle straying and did not reach the Shoals until Friday . They got to Charles Robertson 's place early in the afternoon . The door was latched . Nobody at home except the dung-hill fowls and the pig in its pen . " They 're all over at the Shoals , " Amos said . The cattle were tired and were standing quietly . They drove them to water in the branch that ran just below Robertson 's house , then started along the path to the river . They had not gone far before they heard a noise like the humming of many bees . Amos slapped his thigh . " There 's more of ' cm come in since I was here . . . . Now say , d' you ever see anything like that ? " They had come up over a little rise . The Sycamore Flats were before them . Far off , water glinting in the sun but between them and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark figures : white men , Indians , women and children , even a few blacks . Rion stood looking and thought that he had never in his life seen so many people in one place before . He shook his head . " What 'll we do with these cattle ? " " They 've got a pen over here , " Amos said . They drove the cattle on through the trees . The pen was down near the branch . A three rail fence , room inside for fifty head of cattle . The bars were down and cattle were being driven through . There were a lot of drovers standing around . One big fellow sat on the top rail shouting at the men who were driving the cattle . As Rion and Amos came up an Indian left the crowd . A tall young buck with silver rings dangling from his ears . He had on a matchcoat . Under it his naked legs shone with grease . Rion stood still while those shining , reddish legs swung past him . That night at Chota Archy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greasedp299all over , just like one of them . He looked off past the pen to the far end of the grounds . That must be the main Indian encampment . One good-sized cabin up already and Indians milling all around it . Three or four hundred at least .... Would Archy dare to show his face here among white men ? The other cattle were through . The drovers were coming out of the pen . Amos was starting his two steers in when the big fellow on the fence suddenly bawled out to the man who was handling the bars not to let any more through . The fellow stood back as if he was surprised . " Why not ? " The big one turned around , almost losing his balance , and lookedover the pen . " They 's too many of ' cot in there already . " Amos gave a long whistle . " I ai n't going to start nothing now , " Rion said to himself . " I ai n't going to start nothing . " Ile walked up to the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were all steers and standing quietly . There was room for a dozen more without crowding . " You want to tie ' em up outside ? " he asked Amos in a low voice . Amos was eyeing the fellow on the fence . " I would n't mind if it was anybody but John Choate . " I Ic looked at the little man . " He was a-riding Tilman when I was down here last week . " Tilman heard him . He dropped the bar he was holding and kicked the other two out of the way . " I Ic ai n't going to ride me no more , " he said . Choate was down off the fence . His jug hit the ground before he did . The cob flew out and the liquor was spilling on the ground . A man behind him picked the jug up and was calling : " Here , John , you better have another drink . " Choate did not hear him . Ile was coming towards Tilman . Tight as a tick , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boss he put his hand out and rested it on the steer 's broad back . Rion looked at Tilman . The man was little but knotty . " I was laying any money it 'd be on this cock , " Rion said to himself . He continued to an imaginary person who sometimes seemed to be standing at his elbow and arguing with him . " Naw , I ai n't going to stand back . Do n't care what you say . . . . Suppose Tilman could n't handle him ! " Choate had lifted his hand from Boss ' back and was walking around the steer towards Tilman. p 300 Rion took a step forward . Tilman flicked him a glance out of the corner of his eye . " Stand back , Stranger , " he said and there was that in his voice that would have made Rion stand back if it had n't been too late , if his blood had n't already been up . He stepped to Boss ' head . The steer stood , placidly slobbering . Rion dropped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choate , separated from him now only by the steer 's body . " You would n't want to stampede my cattle now , Friend ? " Somebody back in the crowd laughed . Choate jerked his head in the direction of the voice then looked at Rion . " What 's that you said ? " " Said I was going to drive my cattle through , " Rion answered in a soft voice . Choate came on , throwing out his arms at first , but that was to get his balance , then stopping so short that he rocked on his heels . He was a man who showed his liquor in his eyes . They glistened like a treed coon 's . " I wish he war n't so drunk , " Rion thought and shot his fist out and buffeted the man on the chest . Choate recoiled from the blow . He ducked his head and charged at Rion , who sidestepped and putting out his foot tripped the man . He stooped and turned him face up . He placed his foot on Choate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . Then he lifted him to his feet and tossed him over his head . Choate lay on the ground , moaning . Rion turned away . He was walking around the edge of the crowd towards the other side of the pen when he saw that Choate had got up . " He 's trying to git to his horse , " a voice cried . " Throw him his horse so he can be riding ! " There was a laugh from the crowd . Rion laughed too and looked up to see James Robertson and another man watching him . He went towards them , still laughing and making a show of dusting his hands off . " Some fine folks you got down this way ! " " They 'll soon take poplar and push off , " Robertson said offhandedly . The young man who was standing with him frowned , looking after Choate as if the very sight of the man disgusted him . " Many of them like that on the Watauga ? " he asked . Rion glanced at the blue-eyed six-footer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to take care of himself . He grinned . " You thinking of settling ? " " Master Sevier rode out from Virginia last November , " Robertsonsaid , " and now he 's thinking of settling . " " Here on the Watauga ? " " He fancies some land higher up . On the Nollichucky . " " That stream we crossed on our trip ? " " That 's right , " Robertson said . His right hand fell on Rion 's elbow , closed on it with an affectionate pressure . " This is the boy who was with me on that trip to ( : hot a , Master Sevier . " Rion grinned again and looked closer at the young Virginian . He was dressed in deerskin as he himself was , but he had a feeling that he ought to be dressed finer , for he had a finical manner for a settler . Probably some big fellow at home , or if he was too young for that , from some big family . Robertson was in with all the high muckety-mucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for him . No finer fellow on the western waters than old Jim ... " You seen Daniel Boone ? " he asked . " I left him over there in the marquee an hour ago . " Rion turned around . " Amos , I 'm going over here a piece . You coming ? " There was a barrel of Monongahela in the fence corner . Amos had got to it . He waved a full horn at Rion and a little of the whiskey fell in bright drops to the ground . " God in the mountain ! " Amos said and put his foot over the spots as if to keep them from getting away . " I 'll be ' long in a minute , Rion . " Rion laughed and walked away between the other two men . Robertson put his hands together , making a tent of his long fingers . " There 'll be many a skull split before this day is over . " " You got to expect that , " Rion said . " Well , Jim , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying they did n't want to sell . Then they wanted to sell that land on the Virginia line that Donelson surveyed . Henderson told them there was n't but one piece of land he wanted to buy , and made out he was n't very anxious to buy that . Some of ' em came over last night and looked at the goods again and they had a conference this morning . They ought to sign today , if they 're going to sign at all . " " Reckon they going to sign at all ? "  | " You ca n't tell with Indians . Our goods come in today , Rion . The goods that 'll pay for our land . You got your money ready ? " " I got a bull calf over in that pen that ought to bring it . " Robertson nodded . " They 'll buy him . Got all they can do to feed these Indians . " They walked on towards the white men 's encampment . There was a path but it was full of water , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trampling . Rion looked up . Above the wintry branches the sky was a deep , pure blue . There had been a little wind in the morning but that had died and the air was as balmy as May . Ground thawed fast in weather like this . A few more windy days and he could be plowing . They came to a fire tended by some negroes . Stew was cooking in a big iron pot and a little way off from the fire on trestles lay the carcasses of half a dozen bears . Two white men stood before the trestles , one skinning and one cutting out the meat . The young Virginian stopped and examined one of the unskinned carcasses . A young he , thin from the winter fast , his bowels still plugged with laurel . He would n't dress a hundred pounds . " I 'd a left that one lying in the woods , " he said with a laugh . A knife came up to point off through the trees . " We got all them Indians to feed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped the skin of his belly down with one drive of the knife . " They going to ruin them hides , " Rion said as they walked on . " But I reckon they have to work fast . . . . Do n't the Indians do nothing towards feeding themselves ? " " Lord , no , " Robertson said , " they 're visiting . " They were in the middle of the grounds . On their left the two log cabins that the white men had built and off in the distance the Indians ' tents . Between the two encampments there was an open space where few trees grew , and moving in this open space around the ashes of a dead fire were white men and Indians . Rion ran his eye over them as if they had been cattle . " Must be five hundred of ' em , " he murmured . " And more coming all the time , " Robertson said . They passed the marquee where grunting negroes were up-ending chunks of wood to make seats , and came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified looking man in broadcloth standing in front of one of them raised his hand in salute to Robertson , thenp303walked off down the path . " That 's John Reid , " Robertson said . " He 's here representing the Virginians . " He led the way to the second cabin . There was no window . The place was dark . In the middle of the dirt floor , where it caught the light from the doorway , was a table heaped with papers . A man sat behind it writing . Over on the , hearth a good fire was burning . A sandy-haired man with a big nose sat close to it , a blanket over his shoulders , his naked feet plunged into a tub of water . On the other side of the hearth a man with a wool hat pushed back on his head squatted on his heels , oiling a gun . The man at the table was reading to himself in a droning voice : " This indenture made fifteenth day March year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherokee Nation tribe Indians and Atta Kulla Kulla and Savanooke otherwise Coronoh Chiefs appointed by warriors and other headmen convey for hole Nation Being Aborigines and sole owners by occupancy beginning time lands on the Ohio river from mouth of Tennessee river up said Ohio to mouth or emptying of the Great Conaway or New river and so across a southward line to the Virginia line by an intersection that shall strike or hit the Holston river six English miles above or east ward of the Long Island therein and other lands or territory thereunto adjoining ... " He looked up . " I put in eastward of the Long Island after what they said yesterday . . . Well , Jim , &you; tall ; to an V of ' cm ? " Judge Henderson . Rion felt like laughing as he thought of the last time they had met . But the judge diet not recognize hint . He was looking at Robertson . " I could n't find the Carpenter , " Robertson said , " but I talked to Oconostota . He says the talk yesterday did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty sure sonic of the others will . " Henderson pushed himself back from the table . I le snapped his fingers . " I would n't give that for a deed unless it was signed in open treaty . " " You 're right . " Rion slipped past them , went to the man on the stool and laid his hand on his shoulder . Boone looked up and was on his feet . " By Godly , I been looking for you ! "  | " I heard you 'd been in and out . I just got down here myself today . " " Where you living ? " " On the south Holston . Just below the Long Island . . . Where you going from here ? " " Up above the Island . I got some men up there now cutting the road . I could stop the night at your place when we leave here .. . Rion , you 've filled out some . You married and got a family ? " " Parson Dawson 's daughter from the Ford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl . Where 's your folks ? " " On the Clinch . But I aim to go up in the new country . You better come along . " Rion grinned . " I ai n't hardly got settled here yet . " The sandy-haired man waved away a negro who wanted to put more hot water in his tub . " Young man , what 's your name ? " " Outlaw . " The other shook his head . " That ai n't your name . You look like a red Highlander to me . More likely MacGregor or Maclntosh . Maybe even Gordon . Your folks got in some trouble in the old country and had to leave . Took the first name that came into their heads and stuck to it from pure contrariness . Just like you 'd do today . You look ornery to me . " " What might your name be ? " Rion asked , grinning . " Me ? I 'm a damned Hogg . When I 's young I thought of taking my mother 's name . Alves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it up for fear of hurting my father 's feelings . But a man do n't like to be called Hogg all his life . I tell my boys they can change any day they want to . The girls 'll have to marry or stay damned Hoggs . " " It is a kind of ridic'lous name , " Rion said . " Still , I 've known worse . When I was a chap we had a neighbor named Swiveltit . " " I could n't a stood that , " Hogg said . " Hogg I can stand up to . Been doing it all my life . But Swiveltit . . . . " Robertson , sitting on one of the bunks , was re-lacing his moccasin . " There 's some of them Indians do n't want to sell , and that 's a fact . " He spoke in a muffled voice , his head bent down , his fingers fumbling with the moccasin thongs . " I was talking to one today . Kept telling me the game was the Indians ' cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a snap and stood up . P305Henderson was pacing the floor in front of him . " If they do n't sign today they wo n't sign at all , " he said . His voice had a dead note in it . He did not look at Robertson as he passed him . Rion , squatting against the wall , eyed him curiously . There was a deep line on each side of his mouth that had not been there three years ago . His eyes were not as bright as they had been . His linen was dirty . Still he looked the big man every inch . Older , but that was natural with all he had on his mind . He realized that it was Henderson who had sent them all west , Henderson who had kept Boone on the move , furnishing him , paving his debts , sending him out again until now they had found what they had been looking for all these years . Twenty million acres . If Henderson made the trade he would be one of the biggest men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be telling folks about when I knew him , " he thought , and then , struck by something about the face , some tensenessof the muscle or expression of the eve , he wondered what the outcome would be . " He do n't look like a winner , " he thought . " Maybe he knows he ai n't going to win and it 's got him down . He's-put everything he 's got into this and he 's going through with it but he do n't feel right about it ... " Boone was walking towards the door . I le followed him outside . They stood in front of the cabin , watching the crowd . " How long since you been back on the Yadkin ? " Rion asked . " I got back a few weeks after you left . We must a passed on the way . " " Them boys that shot up the wagons , you hear much talk about them ? " " Some of them left the country , " Boone grinned , " like you did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A battle ? " " At the Alamance river . " " Soldiers put ' em down ? " " The boys did n't have enough ammunition . Come out with enough powder for a day 's hunting and when that was gone they had to quit . . . Tryon hanged two from your neighborhood . " " Hanged ? " Rion said . " Buried ' em in that grove by the courthouse . Tom Beard and Jesse Andrews . " A woman was coming towards them , holding two children by thep306hand . The little boy kept looking back over his shoulder at an Indian who stood against a tree , his arms folded on his chest . Rion could see that cellar of Braun 's with the muster roll spread out in the light of the one candle : THOMAS BEARDORION OUTLAWHe gave a sigh . " Sometimes I wish I had n't left the way I did .. . Where was Husbands when this was going on ? " " He left the country before the fighting started . He was against it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiptoe . " I believe those Indians are starting over . Least there 's some kind of a stir . " The white men were coming out of the cabin , Hogg last , booted and calling to his nigger : " Boy , fetch me a blanket , I got to go , if I catch my death of cold . " They were taking their seats under the marquee : Henderson in the middle , Thomas Hart on one side of him , Hogg on the other , then James Robertson , John Williams and half a dozen men Rion had never seen before . Rion and Boone stood behind the marquee , close enough to hear what was being said . Rion looked over at the Indians . The whole crowd was drawing up in two long lines . Suddenly a young warriorcame running down the lines . Midway between the two old chiefs he stopped in his tracks long enough to fire his musket into the air , then whirling ran back to the.end of the line . Another one came after him and now the firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pretty , ai n't it ? " Rion said . " That 's what they call a f eu-de-joie , " Boone told himYoung Sevier had come up and was standing with them . " It 's a waste of powder . If it 'd a been me I 'd taken their guns away from them soon as they came on the grounds . " James Robertson in front of him gave a dry laugh and half turned his head . " You would n't a got very far with that . " The last warrior had fired and had run back towards the end of the lines . The chiefs walked slowly over to the seats that had been prepared for them , up-ended chunks of wood , like the white men 's , but most of them were covered with furs or cloth . The linguister was coming forward , the same , dark , long-facedp307man that had been at the Island that day . He took his place halfway between the red men and the white . After a little the old peace chief , Atta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking . Although it was warm he wore a matchcoat , cut just like a Christian 's but trimmed with red and blue beadings . His ears , weighted with the heavy silver , hung down below his cheekbones . His voice was deep to cone from so small a man . He spoke slowly , with pauses in between . The linguister , John Vann , spoke up briskly , his eyes all the time dwelling curiously on the white men : Atta Kulla Kulla was an old man but had for a long time been friend to both white and red . He was glad to see them gathered together here at the Broken Waters where the Cherokees always came in the spring of the year ... . Rion yawned and looked around the circle for faces he knew . There was the war chief , Oconostota , on a scat covered with red stroud ; next to him the one they had pointed our as the Old Tassel . He had on the most silver of any of them . 1 Hs eves went on down the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech that night at Chota and , sitting beside him , taller by half a head , the big , pock-marked fellow he 'd seen on the Long Island that day he leased his land . The others all had silver in their cars and trinkets on their necks and arms , but he wore nothing but his flap and a necklace of the longest bear 's claws Rion had ever seen . " He 's like a Quaker , " Rion thought , " believes in dressing plain . " He laughed at his own conceit . Boone turned around . " What you laughing at ? " " I do n't know . Sometimes they act just like real folks , do n't they ? " Boone did not answer . His eves were on I Icnderson who was just then standing up to address them in a voice loud enough to carry over the whole crowd . " I am glad that the headmen and warriors of the Cherokee Nation have come here to talk with their white brothers . . . The white man has not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets . . . The great chief , Atta Kulla Kulla , has seen the goods gathered together there in the cabin ... ' ' Rion kept looking at Oconostota . While Atta Kulla Kulla had been talking he had kept his long head sunk on his chest , but now he raised his head and sent a quick , bright look around the circle . " He do n't really want to sign , " Rion thought , " but he wants those guns for his men . . . He 's old but there 's mischief in him yet . " " There 's the deed , " Boone said in a low voice . Henderson was getting a thick roll out of his cow-skin satchel . He spread it out on the block in front of him . Atta Kulla Kulla and Oconostota got up and went forward . Stepping behind them was the Raven and behind him the linguister . They approached the block and stood looking down at the paper , then Oconostota said something and put his hand out and touched the paper . Henderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deed , " he said impatiently . " Nine copies , one for each partner , all exactly the same , a precaution in case of fire or theft ... " The linguister turned and spoke to the Indians in a voice so low you could not hear him . Finally Oconostota nodded his head and advanced his hand towards the quill that 1 Icnderson was holding . The man from Virginia was getting to his feet . " Would it not be proper to read the boundaries of the land before letting the chiefs affix their marks ? " he asked in a clear , sharp voice . Henderson started . " I pray you , Master Reid , my partners and I have been at great expense . . . " The Virginian pursed his lips . An obstinate look came on his face . " It is not generous to get a people to sign a deed if they do not know what it says . " Henderson whirled around toward him . He made an impatient , fiddling gesture with his fingers . " They understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pray you do not interfere at this juncture ! " The Indians were not paying any attention to Henderson or the Virginian either . They were looking back towards the circle of seated chiefs . One of them had risen and was walking slowly out into the middle of the circle : Dragging Canoe , the big , pock-marked chief of the Great Island.  |p309THE  DARK LANTHORN stood on the south bank of the river and watched the water flow smoothly down hetween the widening banks to break on the great boulders that in this place covered the whole bed of the stream . It was early afternoon . The sun had left the north bank and hung directly over the river . Its rays struck sparkles from the eddies that curled about the rocks . She half closed her eyes and yellow light played over the whole surface of fretted water . " I have seen the Broken Waters , " she thought . " I have come to them an old woman but at least I have seen them now before I die . " She stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust her feet into the water . It was pleasant to feel it lapping against her bare flesh . She hitched herself along the hank and thrust her feet in deeper . It was as if she were touching water for the first time today and yet she had gone to bathe at dawn with the other women . But the bathing had not brought its usual refreshment . She had seen more than one woman looking over her shoulder as she flung the water to the Four Winds and she herself had felt as if one of the ugly white men might step out from behind the willows at any moment , although , she reflected , the river was the last place they would come . Four days she had been on the Broken Waters and in all that time she had not once seen a white man going down to the water . She had asked her husband about that and he had replied that it was not the custom of the whites to go to water , particularly , after the cold weather had set in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suggested , and he agreed that when a great crowd of white men was gathered in one place the odor was indeed overpowering . She leaned her head back against a tree trunk and closed her eyes . Pictures from her long journey rose before her : the long trail to Cross creek , the streets crowded with people , and finally the greatp310house in which the goods were stored . But they had stopped at a larger house than that on the way back , two storeys , made all of brick . The men who lived in it wore long black coats . They had taken her into one room that was as large as the town house at Chota . In the far corner there was a contrivance of reeds and from those reeds , as plainly as she now heard the sighing of the wind in the brush , came the voice of a woman singing . Clearly a piece of magic . There had been other sights and sounds almost as strange . There had been so many things to marvel at she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she came away from the crowd and sat by herself for a while , calling the pictures up and impressing them on her memory . There was something moving on the bank behind her . She turned around . Her granddaughter , Na-Kwi-si , stood there eyeing her . " Grandmother , my father is speaking in council . " " You mean your grandfather . He has already spoken three times since the council started and doubtless will speak again . " The girl was silent a moment , then she said : " I mean my father , the chief of the Great Island . " The Lanthorn watched a weed round up against a rock and slide over it . " He is old enough to speak in council , " she said in a dry voice , " but he is a warrior , not an orator . He had better have left it to the older men . " The girl was gone through the trees . The Lanthorn sat still for a few minutes ; then she too rose . She was not vainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canoe , was speaking in council she would hear him . She walked swiftly up the path and worked her way in among the crowd until she could see the headmen , seated in a circle as they had been yesterday , all except her son , the Dragging Canoe . He stood in the center of the circle , the linguister , John Vann beside him . He stood there taller than an ordinary man , wearing no ornament except a necklace of bear 's claws . The March sun struck full on his upturned face , on the broad cheekbones , on the nose that thrust out bold as a hatchet . But for those pits that the white men 's disease had left , he would have been the handsomest man on the grounds . " Last night I dreamed that I was with my grandfather ... " He resembled his grandfather , Chief Yellow Bird , more than he did his own father . It was not only his stature and the bones of hisp31Iface , but the look out of the eye . Ever since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching look . " But my grandfather was sad . Ile kept his hand to his forehead . His body leaned to one side . . . " The voice was sonorous and full . The speech began well . Her father always began his speeches with a reference to the past . " To dwell on the glorious deeds of one 's ancestors elevates the mind , " he used to say . Chief Yellow Bird , although a warrior , was a man of thought . In the spring he went with the physicians to the woods to gather their herbs , and back at the lodge he would sit for hours discussing the nature of the world : " The Great Spirit has caused everything in nature to be round except stone , which is the implementof destruction . Everything that grows from the ground is round , like the stem of a plant . Everything that breathes is round , like the body of a man . Since the Great Spirit has caused everything to be round mankind should look on the circle as sacred . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eat or sleep for the smell of my people 's blood ! " But we came in peace ! She stared at her son , then pressed forward until she could see her husband 's face . His mouth remained set in the expression of grave politeness , but his eyes , wide open , were fixed upon the speaker . Judge Henderson , the one they called Carolina Dick , half rose , but somebody pushed him back . The white men wanted to know what had been said . One was calling wit now to the linguister . John Vann spoke to them . The Canoe did not wait for him to finish . He put out his hand and the man fell hack . The Canoe turned to the chiefs . " I do not speak to you with my own voice but with that of many ancient peoples . Our fathers came here long ago , from a great water . The Muskohge held this land then . " They were warlike but they could not stand against the Real People . We drove them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their fathers . In those days there were other warlike people who lived across the mountains : the Pamunkeys , the Chickahominies . Where arc they now ? Gone . ' Whole nations . Melted away before the white man like snowballsbefore the sun . We have said in council : ' But they will not cross the mountains . They will not make war on the Real People . ' That hope has vanished . They have crossed the mountains and have settledp312upon our land . Our father , Stuart , told them to leave . But they did not go . And now they ask that we give them the land to sit down on forever . " He walked over and stood before his father . " Give them the deed they ask and they will not be content . They will ask for more and yet more land ... " Atta Kulla Kulla looked at his son but did not speak . The Canoe walked away from him and stood before Oconostota . " They will stand finally in your beloved town , in Chota . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tellico . Where will the great war chief be then ? " She saw Oconostota 's shoulders rising and now the whole column of his body towering opposite her son . It was true what they said of him , that in anger his eyes shone red . The Dragging Canoe looked into the red eyes and smiled . " The great war chief will have fled , with his people , across the mountains . The white men will follow and cut him down . At the great river or where the mountains start again . What does the place matter ? " He turned his back on the war chief . He took his tomahawk out of his belt and threw it towards a log that lay halfway between the Real People and the Whites . The blade sank deep into the wood . He waited until the handle had stopped quivering . " I am for war , " he said . " My very breath is bloody ! " He raised his head . The war chief stood with his eyes on the ground . The Canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glance , and he turned and left the council.  |p313RION  WANTED Cassy to stay at Jacob 's while he and Frank were away but she had just started making some soap from fat she had been saving and did n't want to leave her work . " Get Jane to stay with me , " she told him . " That 'll be companv enough . " " All right , " Rion said , " if you 'll sleep at Jacob 's you can both stay around here in the day time , 1 reckon . " Jane came down the next morning , leading her Devon cow and the three-weeks-old calf . Gassy had not seen the heifer since she came in . She stood in the doorway , watching , while Jane tied the heifer to a tree . Looking at the bag , still distended to the size of a hominy mortar , with the blue veins standing out from the sleek , cream-coloured skin , Gassy thought how long it had been since she had had a cow 's teat in her hand . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head into the warns flank , and grasping one of the teats sent a stream of milk on to the ground . She turned around to Jane , laughing . " Le'me milk tonight ! " " I 'll let you milk every night and morning too , " Jane said . She gave the heifer a slap on the flank as she turned away . " You going to be more trouble than you 're worth . " " No , she is n't , " Gassy said . " I 'll feed her . " " You do it then , " Jane said , " and I 'll take care of the baby . " During the next three days she nursed Malcolm while Gassy did the outdoor work . Malcolm would not have much to do with Jane but as she said she could watch him , he could n't bar her from that . Gassy was glad to get away from the house for a change . The fodder had been gone for two weeks . The cattle  --  the Outlaws ' dry cow and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning Gassy drove them into the woods . She had not realized until she got out of the clearing how far spring was advanced . There were a few patches of snow left , on the north sides of slopes and in hollow trees , but the air was balmy and the trees were already showing buds . The slippery elms had the biggest buds . Cassy carried Rion 's light axe along and felled as many little elm trees as she could find , and when they gave out she would reach up as high as she could and cut from the larger trees all the boughs that had swollen tips . Then she would leave the two cows in the woods , grazing on the boughs , until late afternoon when she would drive them up to milk . On Wednesday afternoon while she was driving them home she found a good sized patch of wild mustard growing in a sheltered place along the creek . She stopped and gathered her dress-tail full . " We 'll have ' em for supper , " she told Jane . Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm . " I do n't see no use cooking when you have n't got men folks , " she said . " We 'll have men folks , " Cassy told her . " Rion said they 'd be home tonight . " " Then you ai n't fixin to sleep at Jacob 's tonight ? " " There wo n't be no need . Rion said they 'd be in tonight . " Cassy put the greens on to boil with a piece of deer meat . She went out and milked the cow and fed the calf . When she came in with the half gallon of milk , which was all that was left after the calf was fed , Jane had the hearth brushed and the fire made up bright . Cassy took her old cloak off and hung it on its peg , and went over and stood in front of the fire . " I declare , I wish we had something to cook tonight , " she said . " There 's two deer hams hanging in the loft , " Jane told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Malcolm , who had run up to clasp her about the knees . " When this one was on the way I took a stunner against deer meat and it has n't ever left me . I crave something besides game . " " You got them two cockerels left , " Jane said . " You got to kill ' em some time . Why' n't you have ' em tonight , seeing as you 're so set on eating ? " " I believe I 'll do it , " Cassy said . " You 'll have to cut their heads off . Them necks is too tough to wring . " Cassy got the axe down and started for the door . When she got there she paused . " I always did hate to kill a chicken after I raised it . " Jane laughed and came over and took the axe from her . " Here , I 'll do it . Them roosters ai n't nothing to me . " She went out with the axe and in a few minutes came back withp31.5the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . The two women scalded the chickens and knelt on the hearth and picked them , stowing the feathers in a deerskin bag that Cassy brought out . A few minutes later Cassy had put them to stew in the iron pot . " What you goin ' to cook your mush in ? " Sarah asked . " You got chickens in one pot and greens in the other . " " We 'll have ash cake , " Cassy told her . She drew a stool up to the fire and took Malcolm on her knee . " It 'd be nice if we could have dumplings with those chickens . " Jane laughed . " You could n't make dumplings out of corn meal . Would n't be no way to bind it together . " The two women sat silent for a while looking into the fire . Jane said : " Back in Otey township I went to an infare once . It was a cousin of mine , getting married . She was getting along , all of twenty-two years old , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands . Anyway they give her a big blow-out . I war n't more'n eight year old at the time but I always remember that supper . " " What did they have ? " " Everything you could think of . They was one thing . A little pie . Chess pie they called it . I stood there and I ate twelve of ' cm before Ma come along and stopped me . " " Twelve pies ! " Cassy said . " They war n't big pies . Doll size , but , Man , they was rich ! " " What was they made out of ? " " It was a kind of custard baked in a crust . Made out of eggs and sugar and milk , I reckon . " Cassy looked down and saw that Malcolm had fallen asleep . She got up and laid him in his crib , and carte back to the fire . " When I was a chap we used to have suet pudding . " " D'your mother make it good ? " " My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to board . This woman I stayed with , Mistress Slaughter her name was , used to make suet pudding every Thursday . Sometimes when the big bag was full she 'd steam a little bag for us children . " " Was she good to you ? " Jane asked . " Good as she knew how to be . There war n't much to her . " " Ai n't it strange now , " Jane said absently . " They 's folks don't think much of children and have the raisin ' of ' em and there 's others thinks the world and all of ' em and do n't have none around . " " The Lord 's ways are hard to understand , " Cassy said . She turned her head and glanced up at the shelf . " Jane , I got three eggs . " " You mean for a pudding ? You ai n't got no sugar and you ai n't got no currants . You ai n't even got no suet . We used all the fat in the house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suet up on that shelf but I do n't mean for a pudding . I mean for a pie like you were talking about . I could sweeten it with some of that pumpkin molasses . " " And make the crust out of meal ? You might try . You bolt meal two or three times and it 's most as fine as flour . " Cassy stood up . " I 'm going to start it now before the men come . " Jane opened the door and looked out . " If they do n't come pretty soon we 'll have to start for Jacob 's . They ai n't more'n an hour of sun left . " Cassy was already bolting meal through a piece of muslin into the buckeye bread bowl . " I 'll go ahead and make the pie , " she said , " and if they do n't come we can take it down to Jacob 's with us . Jacob and Sarah wo n't mind having pie for supper . " And she laughed excitedly . She mixed the crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortening , then stirred up her custard in the small brass kettle and set the kettle on a bed of coals . While the custard was thickening she prepared the pie crust , patting it with her hands instead of rolling it , as she had no rolling pin . " What in the Nation am I going to bake it in ? " she asked when she had finished . Jane was ranging before the shelf where Cassy kept her cooking vessels . She took down the long-handled iron skillet . " It 's the only thing anywhere near the right shape , " she said , " and the handle 'll be handy when you get ready to brown it . " Cassy fitted the crust into the skillet and poured the custard in on top of it and was about to set the skillet on the bed of coals when she suddenly raised it up . " I ai n't goin ' to cook it till they come . That way we 'll have it hot . " " There they come now , " Jane said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were riding up into the clearing , Rion first , then Frank and Amos , and behind them a stranger dressed in deerskin.  |p317Cassy  looked at him and said : " It 's Daniel Boone , from the Yadkin ! " She pushed past Jane and ran to meet them . Rion had just halted his horse under the hickory tree . I le leaned down and kissed her hard on the lips , and with one hand still on her shoulder spun her around to face the visitor . " Here she is , Daniel . " Daniel Boone had just thrown his leg hack to dismount . He got off his horse and coming up to her took her hand and held it while he looked earnestly into her eyes . " Parson Dawson 's daughter , " he said , " from Trading Ford . " Cassy made him a curtsey , something she had not done in a long time . " You are not like to remember me , Master Boone . I was a chap last time I saw you . " " And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still holding hers . " You were after deer in the woods back of our house and stopped for a drink of water . " " I remember , " Boone said . " ' ' I'was in buck running time . I came out of the woods and found a house where none had been a month before . A gentleman came to the door and told me I 'd better take brandy , so I put a drink of his brandy on top of the water from the spring . " Frank laughed . " ' T was my father . He held that brandy was a sovereign cure for all ills . " Cassy released her hand from Boone 's grasp and stepped back . " Here 's my neighbor , Mistress Eaton , conic to keep me company while the men were away . " Rion had left them and was unsaddling the horses . " Git me some salt , Cassy , " he called . " I 'll salt Daniel 's horse here under the tree and then they wo n't be no fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salt but suddenly remembering her manners ran back and held the door open . " Come in all and rest you . Supper 's on the coals . " Jane Eaton affected delicacy . " We 'd best be going , Mistress Outlaw . You 've a house full as ' t is . " Gassy was on her way out with the salt but she stopped long enough to catch Jane by the shoulder and shake her . " Yell not leave this house without your supper , so say no more . " She handed Rion the panikin that held the salt and ran back intop318the house . Frank was standing in front of the fire , stretching himself and yawning . Daniel Boone was over in the corner on one knee , unfastening his pack . Frank saw him lift a book out and lay it on the floor while he rummaged for something else . He went over to him quickly . " You 've a book ? " Boone handed him the book and rose . " I always take a book along for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming towards the fire . Frank went to his stool in the corner and began turning the pages of the book . He looked up at Boone . " Gulliver 's Travels , " he said . " We were reading that book around the fire one night , " Boone said , " when a band of Indians came and surprised us . I lost the book in the fracas but I went back next morning and retrieved it . We had to swim a creek to get to the place , trying to come up to it another way , you see . Alex Neely , he was with me , said we should name the creek out of the book so we called it Lulbegrud . Because we were reading about the Lulbegruds when the Indians came ... " Frank looked up , the vague look in his eye that Cassy knew so well . " Aye , " he said . " Aye . " He gestured towards the shelf on the east wall . " I 've Lucretius there and Pliny and Hesiod too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin ? " " Thank ye , " Boone said . " I 'm no scholar . " There was a cry from the far corner of the room . The baby was awake and Malcolm was sitting up and peering over the bark wall of her crib . Cassy was going to her but Jane Eaton was before her . She had the baby in her arms  --  the first time she had ever allowed her to hold her  --  and was bringing her over to show to Boone . " Eighteen months old , " she said , " and walks as good as anybody . Got twelve teeth . Open your mouth , Sarah . Show Master Boone . " Sarah looked down at the floor and pursed her lips up tight . Boone laughed . " Cat 's got her tongue and I do n't believe she 's got no teeth either . " He leaned towards the child and sang in a deep voice : " Oh you little dear , Who made your breeches ? Daddy cut ' em outAnd Mammy sewed the stitches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , holding the child in her lap . Gassy soothed the baby , then went back to the hearth and lifting the lid of the pot stuck a fork in one of the chickens . It was almost done . She replaced the lid on the pot and stood a moment , considering what had best be done next . Rion would be calling for his supper in a minute and there were the ash cakes still to be made and the pie to brown and the table to set . She glanced at Jane who was claspingSarah to her with a silly smile while she listened to Boone 's foolishness . " You 'd think it was her own child , " Gassy thought with a flash of the malice that beset her sometimes when things did not go to suit her , and then she told herself that it was easier to have the three of them there at the side of the hearth where they were out of the way . Rion and Amos had come in . Rion watched Cassy holding the long-handled skillet close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What in the Nation you got there ? " he asked . " Larroes to catch meddlars , " she said tartly . " I 'd be obliged if you 'd fix me a bed of coals for the cake . " " I 'll do it as soon as I bring in a back log , " he told her . " Why ca n't you do it now ? " she flared . He stopped and looked at her , surprised . " I ca n't fix the ashes right till I get the back log in , " he said and went out the door . In a few minutes he carne back with a back log and a forestick . He arranged them with his usual deliberate care and then took the shovel and raked glowing coals into a bed and covered them with ashes . When he had done this he brought the ash board over to the table to Gassy , and held it for her While she put the cakes on it . He had to wait while she patted the last one into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry after all , was you ? " he asked . And when she looked away from him and did not answer , he said : " I laving companydo n't seem to agree with you . " Gassy felt as if she were going to cry . She set the last cake on the board in a hurry , then walked over to the far corner of the room . The wash basin and jug were there on a bench . She washed her hands and took a long time drying them . She started back towards the fire . Sarah saw her and began crying for her . Jane handed her over . " I 'll set the table whilst you give her and Malcolm their supper , " she said and went and gotr the cup of milk and bowl of cold mush that had been set up for them . The baby ate greedily and dropped off to sleep as soon as she was through . When Cassy came back to the fire after putting her into her crib , Jane was pulling the pie back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " and you better take these chickens up too . I stuck ' em a minute ago and they was done . " Rion came quickly to Cassy 's side , holding the big iron fork . " Here , " he said , " let me do that . " He had the chickens out of the pot and on to the platter . Turning back to the fire he drew the ash board out and slid half a dozen cakes into a bowl . " Hit 's on the table now , " he said . " Sit down . " Cassy cast a glance around the table as she took up the greens . Jane had not wasted these last few minutes . Shc had known without being told that the little pat of butter they 'd been saving for two days was to be used tonight . And she had thought to put the jug of milk on too . Rion was putting a drum stick and slices of both dark and light meat in Boone 's bowl . " Hit 's a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , you 'll want some of the gravy . " He got up and going over to the pot dipped up the little pewter jug full of gravy and divided it between the Eatons and Boone . He was back with another jugful . " Here , " and he would have poured some in Cassy 's bowl but she shook her head . " I ai n't hungry right now . " He bent closer to her . " What 's the matter ? " She smiled up into his face . " Nothing . " " I 'll send you a piece of the breast , " he said and went back to his place . Cassy ate her piece of breast and sopped an ash cake in a little gravy which she finally poured from the pitcher , then sat back a little from the table , watching the others eat . It took them a long time to eat all of the chickens and greens but now they were through . " I never had a chicken taste better to me , " Amos said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jane told him . " You ai n't through yet . " Cassy brought the pie . Rion handed her his cutty knife and she cut it into five big pieces . The crust had stuck to the pan a little butp32Ishe was able to get it out by running the knife around under it , and the custard stayed firm . " It 's a pie ! " Daniel Boone said . I is looked at Cassy and smiled . " You mind me of my Rebecca . I tell her she can make more out of nothing than any woman 1 know . " He took a bite . " Hit 's good , " he said . " I low did you sweeten it ? " " Pumpkin molasses , " she told him . " You want another piece ? " " You keep one for yourself . " She shook her head . " I 'd rather you all ate it . " " There wo n't be no trouble about that , " Amos said . The pie was eaten . They were rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jane helped her carry them to the bench in the corner and took the dish clout and dried the pewter for her . When they had ranged all the dishes on the shelf and had tidied up the hearth , they took the dishpan outside and emptied it at the edge of the clearing . As they were going back Jane said , " Wait a minute , " and stepped off into the bushes . Gassy stood there holding the dishpan and looked up at the sky . It had been so warm earlier in the day that they had thought a rain was blowing up from the south , but towards sun-down it had turned off cold and now all the stars were out . It would he cold and fair tomorrow . She remembered a night at her old home on the Yadkin when she and Rion had stood out in the yard looking up at the stars . A night in spring and the stars had been bright with sparkles of gold fire to them like they had tonight . The same stars shining on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were n't so far from home . And tonight , around the table , with everybody eating and talking about how good things were , it had been like old times back on the Yadkin .. . Jane had come up at the side of the house and was standing on the doorstep , waiting . " All right , " Gassy said and followed her into the house . Malcolm was asleep . Frank was still reading in Boone 's book . The other three men were drawn up close to the fire , talking . Rion and Boone were cleaning their guns . Amos , who never did today what he could put off till tomorrow , sat there , watching them . Rion looked over at Cassy . " We got another deed to our land , " he said . " How come ? "  | " They got to talking and James said as long as Lawyer Henderson was there we 'd better get him to make a deed for our land along with the rest of the Purchase so they drew up a deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Boone . " That makes the third time I 've treated with ' em for this land .... You know for a while there I thought war n't any of the deeds going to get signed , when that big chief they call the Canoe ' walked out . That was quite a speech he made , war n't it ? " " I did n't like the looks of things , " Boone said . " Well , they went on and signed . " " That was the Carpenter , and I do n't know yet how he turned the trick . The young bucks 'd have followed the Canoe at the drop of a hat . I saw two of them standing there after the goods had been given out . One of ' em had on a shirt that was his share of the purchase . He felt it and I heard him say they 'd given the land away , that he could have killed enough deer on it in one day to buy that shirt . " Rion laughed . " So he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to pay ? " Gassy asked . " Two thousand pounds in leather goods . Charles Robertson 's trustee . He is n't sure how many men are coming in on it yet . " " That ai n't high for the land , " Boone said , " but you do n't want to fool with this land around here . Wait till you see Kentucky . " " Is it much richer than this ? " Rion asked curiously . " Richer and lies level . And the game ! I seen a sight there I 'll never forget . John Findley and I come out on top of a big hill and there below was a meadow , big as all Carolina and full of white clover , and grazing on that clover must have been three or four hundred buffalo . We went down the side of the hill and up to the place . It was a sight to see ' em making off , some running , some loping and the young calves playing alongside their mothers . " " It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rion said . " Remember he told us about them big licks and the game so thick ? . . . Whateverbecame of that fellow , Daniel ? " " Well , we located that place on the Louisa where he traded with the Indians soon after we got out there . Soon as he found it , seemed like he sort of lost interest in the country . Then we had a brush with the Indians . Holden and Mooney and Cooley were for going back after that . Findley said he 'd guide them as far as the gap . "  | " Where was he heading from there ? " " Back to Pennsylvania . Least that 's what he ' said one night , sittingaround the fire . In early June that was . Next morning after breakfast I went to the spring for a drink . When I got back Findley was riding off through the trees . He turned around and he saw me standing there by a big tamarack , looking after him . He saw me but he did n't make no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him go . " He glanced from one face to the other with a puzzled expression . " A strange way to part , war n't it ? " " Had you had any difference ? " Rion asked . Boone shook his head . " No , it was just his way . . . When I got back to the camp Holden and the rest was loading their horses fast as they could to make after hint . Said he did n't give them any warningeither . Just stood up and said he was for the gap and anybody wanted to could go along . " " Well , that was like him , " Rion said . " That fellow , he did n't care for nobody nor nothing but traipsing around the country .. . Daniel , it 's been six years , ai n't it , since you first started to Kentuck ? " " I tried to settle there two years ago , " Boone said , " in the fall of ' 73 . Sold out in North Carolina and started with Rebecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other families . They was forty of us in all . " " D' you come through here ? " " We come through here , " Boone said , " and we got as far as Powell 's Valley . We had to turn hack there . The others went on to the Yadkin but we stayed the winter on the Clinch , at David Gass ' station . " " The Clinch ! " Rion cried . " Us here on the Holston and you no farther away than the Clinch ! " Boone was looking into the fire and did not seem to hear him . " It was in September , " he said . " We got as far as Powell 's Valley and then I thought we needed some more flour so I sent Jamie back to Captain Russell 's ... " Cassy made a little murmur . " Jamie 's the oldest , ai n't he ? " " Seventeen , " Boone said heavily , " he 'd a been seventeen this year . " Rion looked at Boone , then laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light pressure . " Go on , Daniel , " he said gently . " He got the flour and started after us , with Captain Russell 's boy and a negro boy and two men was working for Russell . They must have lost their way or maybe the cattle lagged  --  that nigger , Petty they called him , could n't get the straight of anything  --  but they camped about three miles behind us that night . That nigger said they heard wolves howling but they did n't think anything of it . " He raised his head . He glared at the company . " Nobody expected any trouble , " he said , " it was just a month before the McAfees had come through , and no trouble , no trouble at all . " " The Indians come ? " " Just before day . They fired into the boys while they was sleeping . Jamie and young Russell was both shot through the hips . One fellow got away  --  never was heard of again . That nigger hid in a pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He stayed hid in that pile of drift all night . There was one of the Indians we all knew . A Shawnee . Big Jim they called him . Petty heard Jamie talking to him when they first came up and then he could hear him begging and begging . That was after they started . " " What did they use ? " Rion asked in a low voice . " Knives . The boys kept trying to turn ' em back with their hands . That was how come the bodies was slashed so bad . " Cassy turned her head and looked at him . " They killed those young boys ? " " Yes , ma'am . One boy was mine and one was William Russell 's . " " Did you turn back and find ' em ? " Rion asked . Boone shook his head . " There was a fellow had deserted from our party , came up just after the Indians had left . He was standing there , not knowing what to do , and William Russell came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man ahead to warn us and Russell and that fellow , Choate , dug the graves . Jamie was buried by the time I got there and the other boy too . " He was silent a while ; then he added : " Rebecca felt bad . She 'd sent a sheet back , wanted I should wrap Jamie in it . " " They ought to a waited to bury him till you came , " Gassy said , weeping . Boone reached across Rion to touch her knee . " Do n't cry now ... William Russell thought best not to wait . Folks have to do the best they can in the woods . " They were all silent . He looked into the fire for a few minutes , and he said : " I went back to Powell 's Valleyp325in May of last year , to Jamie 's grave . They 'd put logs on it but the wolves had pawed them off and dug part way in . I opened up the grave  --  they buried them together  --  and made sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered ' em up again , so deep that nothing could n't ever get in . " " I do n't know whether I could have done it , " Rion said . " D' you go by yourself ? " " There was n't anybody convenient to go with me , " Boone said , " and Rebecca was worrying , feared they had n't put the logs on the grave . I was glad I went . After I got home I was glad I went but that night I had one of my spells , the worst one I ever had in my life . . . " " What kind of spell ? " Rion asked . " Melancholy , " Boone said . " Profound melancholy . I 've had those spells three or four times in my life . While they last I 'm not a natural man . " Frank looked up suddenly front his book . " How did you feel , Master Boone ? " " Like I could n't live , " Boone said , " like there war n't no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood over hint . " Your spirit had been weakened by the shock , " he said . " It is a phenomenon recognized by the Ancients . Lucretius has written of it . " 1 le stepped to theshelf and took down his copy of " Dr Rerun Natura. " 1 will readyou what he says , or rather I will translate , for you tell me you have no Latin . " " I 'd be obliged , " Boone said . Frank read : " . . . the spirit weakened by some cause or other often appears to wish to depart and to be released from the whole body , and even the countenance appears to grow languid as at the last hour , and all the limbs of the bloodless trunk to relax and fall . . . " " I was weak as a cat , " Boone said . " I remember I was laying there looking up at the sky and I heard Indians creeping up and I knew I 'd have to ride for it . I got up and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing it myself , it was like somebody else was telling me what to do . " " Lucretius argues that the spirit is mortal , " Frank said . " He cites the putrefaction of the body when the spirit has left it , and holds that the spirit suffers a similar putrefaction when torn from the body . " Boone shook his head . A wise look came on his face . " You mean the spirit rots same as the body ? When I was a boy and used to go to meeting I heard ' em talk about man 's soul being immortal ... " Rion looked into the fire , thinking of Jamie . It was hard to realize that he was grown , old enough to send off through the woods like that . He always thought of him as he had been when they took him with them on that trip over the mountains . Long ago that was . He could n't have been more than ten but he had toughened up quick once he got in the woods . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned off cold and they 'd been afraid he 'd freeze if they left him to sleep by himself , so they took turns holding him up against them . He kicked a good deal and he ground his teeth all night long . Too much buffalo tongue , but Daniel never could see it and would let him eat his fill of it every time .. . He looked over at Boone . It had been a long time since they two had been in the woods together . Some of the feeling of those old days came over him . He remembered the first time that Daniel Boone had ever spoken to him , had ever taken any notice of him . There had been a muster in Salisbury , and after it was over a lot of men went down near the river and drove a nail in a big sycamore and started shooting . Daniel was one of them . He , Rion , had n't been more than thirteen at the time . He stood back , of course , whilst the older men were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a fellow stepped out he 'd raise old Betsy and sight down her like he was shooting too . They got down to the two best shots finally . Daniel beat the other fellow . He must have noticed how bad Rion wanted to shoot , for when the crowd was breaking up he called Rion over and drove in a new nail and told him to have a shot at it , then stood by until he had finally put a bullet through it  --  it took him three shots . The crowd was all gone by that time and they walked up from the river bank together . Daniel said  --  it was before he went to live on the upper Yadkin  --  that he was going over in the Dunn 's Mountain country the next day and asked Rion to go along with him . . . That was the first time they ever went hunting together . Boone turned his head and smiled , not at Rion but at something . Frank was saying , then his features settled into their usual , calm resolute expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was ap327chap and Daniel first started taking notice of him , he had thought that Daniel was the finest looking fellow he had ever seen . It had hurt his feelings the way his family talked about Daniel . A vagrant , he heard his mother call him once . Daniel had n't changed much in these six years , but looking into his face tonight he saw something that he had never seen before -- had they seen it all along ? That look he had , almost too bold for a human . When a beast was set on going its way you could n't stop it , short of killing it . Daniel talked about Kentuck and likely it was all he said it was , but if it was n't he would n't care . He 'd be off over the next range to see if the land there was n't better . Or if Kentuck turned out to be the richest land ever was anywhere , something would take Hint away from it . He did n't have any choice . He was one of those men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat hunched forward on her stool , gazing into the fire , not seeming to listen to what Frank was saying . Her long hair had come uncoiled and the tail of it had slipped doom her back . He had the impulse to lean over and take her hair in his hand and pull it but something in the expression of her face staved him . She was a queer woman . Most of the time she stuck right with him , closer than a cockle burr ; then all of a sudden her head would go up and that blank look would come into her eves and if he said anything to her then , he 'd get an answer that Wright have conic from a stranger . It was a thing he never got used to , a thing he dreaded , that look and the cold , far-off sound her voice would have then . She turned her head . Their eyes met . He smiled at her and felt pleasure flood over him as her gaze softened under his . He knew now what she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be off with Boone to Kentuck , that it was all to do over again , the building of the house , the settling , the getting together of gear ... He was glad when Boone spoke to him . " Well , Rion , you better come on to Kentuck . " He shook his head . " No , I been here four years . After a man 's worked land that long it do n't look right to turn around and leave it . "  |p328ARCHY  STOPPED on the trail and looked back . The Owl was several yards behind him . When he saw Archy looking at him , he walked faster . Archy stood there until he had caught up with him then he bent down and examined his friend 's foot . New skin had formed over the wound but the flesh under it looked tender and you could still see the dark , purplish spot where the cane had stabbed . Archy rose and walked a little way off the trail and sat down on a log . " I 'll rest here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , looking down the trail . " They will come soon , " he said . " It will be a spectacle ! My brother , the Dragging Canoe , at the head of eighty warriors  --  to say nothing of our white brother 's escort . How many warriors do you think he will have ? " Archy shook his head . " Not many . " " Our father , Stuart , would give them to him if he asked ? " " He would n't want them . " " But think of the glory ! " Archy grinned . " White men do n't think it 's much glory to follow a pack train five hundred miles through the woods . " The Owl nodded in the way he had learned from Archy . " You are right . I have heard my brother , the Dragging Canoe , say that to a white man glory is no more than a worm crawling on the ground . He will not put out his foot to crush it but it can crawl away if it wishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . He came over and gently touched Archy 's arm . " I hold you fast , " he said . " I hold you fast with both hands . " " I hold you fast , " Archy repeated mechanically . He looked past the Owl to where the trail took a turn down hill . The Canoe and his men ought to be coming along any time . The runner who had come into town at noon had said that they were not three hours behind him . They had been away since early March , four months in all . He glanced at the Owl 's brown , lively face . Butp329for the Owl he , Archy , would have been one of that band that had gone south with Dragging Canoe to meet the king 's agent . The Canoe had come by Chota the morning they started . He had seen Archy standing there in the square and had asked Atta Kulla Kulla if his white brother might not come with them . Atta Kulla Kulla had been agreeable . Archy was about to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling the Owl 's eyes on him . There was no question of the Owl 's going . It was the very day he had got the cane stab . In fact the women had just finished dressing his wound . He sat there against a tree and watched the others , and the look on his face was more than Archy could stand . He had told the Canoe that the honor was too great , that he was as yet unproved as a warrior and besides did not care to go among white men . The Canoe did not say anything but he had a curious expression on his face as he turned away . Arclw wondered now what the Canoe had made of his saying that he did not care to go among white men . Had he thought that he might possibly be tempted to stay with them and never return to Chota ? There was a tiny nick in his left nostril where a trailing briar had got him yesterday . A gnat was buziing at it . Ile put up his hand and absent-mindedly slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have entered his head , but lately everything seemed changed . All that fall and winter there had been talk that the white men were going to war amongst themselves . The people at Chota and the Great Island did not know what to make of it . " Scotchie "  --  that was Alexander Cameron , the deputy superintendent  --  saidthat it was all talk , but when the ammunition that the Cherokees were in the habit of receiving from Charleston did not arrive , he did not know what to say . At last a letter came from the superintendent , John Stuart : Men from South Carolina , enemies of the King , had seized the Cherokees ' ammunition three days out from Charleston . Their father -- as they all called Stuart  --  could do nothing . He was abed with the old trouble in his foot . But he was sending his brother to them with thirty more horse loads of powder . Atta Kulla Kulla and Oconostota were glad to hear that the powder was on the way and thought that the trouble might die down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart , might meet more enemies of the King along the way . He and a band of his warriors would go to meet him . They started south in March and no news had been heard of them until this day in mid-summer when the runner had come , saying they were not far behind him . A locust tree that was being bent for a bow grew near the path . The Owl limped over to it now and swinging himself up stretched his length along the trunk and looked down at Archy through the bright coin-shaped leaves . " Bear-Killer , is your marriage a make haste or will it last ? " " It 's going to last , " Archy said . The Owl smiled . " She was crazy to get you and now you find that she is a good girl to have under your blanket , eh ? " " I would n't trade her for any of them , " Archy said . The Owl nodded his head . " They arc very passionate , those girls of the Hollow Leaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard my father say . . . . She comes of important people . Cousin to the Ghigau . . . . " " I do n't love that old woman , " Archy said . " My mother does not love her either . My mother , if she had not been a woman , would have been a physician . She knows all the plants and understands the signs . I heard her tell my father once that it was her belief that the Ghigau was one of those who live on withoutthe soul . " " What do you mean ? " " It happens sometimes . The old white man , Mouncy , lost his at Fort Loudon . " " He do n't have much life about him , " Archy said . " He would be dead if he were one of the Real People . With a white man it does not seem to matter . . . I did not say so to my mother but it seems to me that there are others in the Nation who live on without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name his father , but the Owl continued dreamily : " Our great man , Oconostota . All my life I have heard what a great man he is , but he does not seem to have acted like a warrior , when my brother , the Dragging Canoe , threw the hatchet into the ground at the Broken Waters .... " " He did n't seem to want to fight , from what I hear , " Archy said . " But then he 's getting old . " " I have heard my father tell of one of our chiefs who made war when he was so old his age could not be counted and so blind that two young men went always behind him to hold his eyelidsp331up . . . . No , I think our great man is great no longer . His soul . was reft from him at Fort Loudon , along with the old white man 's .... " He turned over on his back and lay with his hands crossed on his breast . Archy sat silent , staring off through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his men had gone . Once when he was about ten years old his father had had to go there on business and had promised to take him , and then at the last minute had left him at home . Lying awake in bed at night , before he knew that he was not to be allowed to go , he had thought about Charleston until its streets had grown up iii his mind . It was probablynot the way he imagined it , and yet when it was mentioned he always felt that he had been there ... . Rion 's face came before him , not the way it had been the last time he saw it , grave , a little suspicious but kindly , but Rion the way he used to look in the early mornings in that loft room they shared together . The call would conic from downstairs  --  their father always rose long before it was light and sat for a long time over the kindling fire . There would be an instant 's silence , then Rion would turn over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . If he had been alone in that attic room he would have lain a little longer , might even have drowsed off again , but the thought of doing to somebody else what his father had just done to him would get him out of bed and on his feet . He would pull on his breeches so fast it would make your head swim , then come and stand over Archy . " Git up , lummox ! You going to lay there all day ? " A ' cute one , Rion . You had to get up early in the morning to get ahead of him . Well , he , Archy had got ahead of him , when Nat Gist carried him that word . He had n't asked Gist how his brother took it , did n't even talk to him when he got back , but sometimes since then he would wake in the night and try to sec how Rion looked when he found he was n't going with him . Would he get mad all at once or would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , and then all of a sudden , maybe hours later , rage would well up in him , like a kettle that stays at the boil a long time and then suddenly spatters all the hearth ? Rion would boil , all right . It would be one of the few times he had ever been fooled in his life and by a boy that he had raised from a pup ! It was a wonder he had n't come back into town to get him.  | No , his feelings , though he would never admit it , would be too hurt for that . . . . He wished there had been some other way but he had known when he first saw Rion in Atta Kulla Kulla 's yard that he would have to fool him . He had never for one moment considered going with him and , indeed , he hardly ever nowadays thought about his old life , only sometimes just before day , or in the day , waiting at a deer stand , he would be overcome with wonder to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news ... . The Owl spoke : " Bear Killer , of all war medicines there is one that I would most like . " " Which one ? " " It is to put your life up in a tree during the fight . There was one of our great men had that medicine once . In all his battles he was never wounded . " " How did he die then ? " " A Creek captain found out about his medicine and told his men to keep firing into the tree tops until , standing there under the trees , this great man fell dead . " " Then the medicine did n't work . " " It worked for many years . " He laughed . " Would you want to live forever ? " " Not that long , " Archy said . The Owl raised himself up a moment , then sank down again . " When will my brother come ? . . . Bear Killer , I am going to learn that medicine and use it all my life , and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vines high up in the trees where I can watch the enemy and send word to our men what they are doing . " " How 'll you send word ? " " I will choose some man who understands such things to be my after-death friend . " " It would be fine if you could work it , " Archy said and laughed . The Owl turned over on the tree trunk so that he lay facing Archy . " I can learn it , " he said . " Bear Killer , I am not an ordinary individual . " " You 're one of the best shots I ever saw , " Archy said . " That is true . But there are many good shots . Bear Killer , I amgoing to be a warrior such as has never been seen in the Nation . " Archy looked at him curiously . " How do you know ? " The Owl glanced behind him as if some one might be listening.  | " It is not good to talk of such things , in summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . . . . You know that when the time comes boys go to the lodge to fast and dream ? " Archy nodded . The Owl continued : " It is had if you do not have a dream . Some do not dream and are ashamed to say so . I was one of those who had a dream . " " What was it ? " " I was in a long ravine , so long that it extended to the ends of the world on both sides . I tried to clinil ) tic sides but my strength gave out and I fell back . Suddenly I heard some one talking behind me , saying My Son , it is not good to die in the village . ' " " Who was it ? " " It was a great white deer , taller than you are , with the signs of the Four Winds painted on his breast . I lc danced before me on two feet and then he tore his stomach open with his hoofs and then he made himself holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old were you when you had this dream ? " " I began fasting when I was seven or eight in those days we were more religious than we are now but I was eleven when the great deer came to me . My father made me stop fasting after that . He said that the blessing was too great , that if I accepted it I would always be wanting to go on the war path . " " So you did n't accept the blessing ? " Archy said . The Owl sat up on the tree trunk , laughing . " My mother is of the Deer People . She said that no matter how great the blessing I must accept it . She took me back to the lodge and I poured tobacco and prayed and the deer came again . ... " " What did he say this time ? " The Owl shook his head , smiling . " I had better not tell you . It is , after all , a holy thing . . . . But I shall be great in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk , taking care to land lightly on his lame foot . " It will be dark before my brother conies . " " There he comes now , " Archy said . A procession was coming along the trail . The Canoe rode at the head beside a white man . Winding away behind them were the pack horses and behind them nearly a hundred warriors on horseback . The Canoe saw the two young men standing beside the path.  | He smiled at them and turning shouted an order that stopped the whole train . He dismounted and going off to the side of the road sat down on a log and holding up the little mirror that hung about his neck looked into it and readjusted the eagle feather in his scalp lock . The white man on the horse stared , but as he saw other warriors looking into their mirrors and adjusting their ornaments , he halted his own horse and sat with his right leg draped woman-fashion over the pommel of his saddle . He was a thin , middle-aged man and wore a dust-stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped from its club at the nape of his neck . His face was streaked with dust and there was a scratch on one cheek where a briar had got him . He did not seem conscious of his appearance , only sat slumped in his saddle , watching the Indians . " Our brother , Stuart , " the Owl said softly . Archy would have liked to go to them , to greet the white man and ask the Indians about their journey , but he knew that it would not do . The Owl was already loping off down the trail as fast as his lame foot would let him . If he , Archy , was kind enough to let him outrun him he would be first in the village and would tell his tale to one of the headmen : the Dragging Canoe and all his band had been kilted , the pack train scattered , the powder stolen . . . . The headmenwould pretend to believe him . They would all begin mourning . The Canoe and his men would wait until the mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The Owl had started whooping . The sound struck the trees and rattled back . Somebody in the village answered . Archy ran faster . The white face he had just seen was still before him . How tired the man looked , and around him all the fresh , smiling Indian faces ! A soft-bred Charleston pup , but white men always looked like that when coming off a march . He opened his mouth and let out a yell while his feet pounded the dirt faster . There would be big doings tonight . Maybe a keg of rum . They would dance all night , he and the Owl and the other young men.  |p335THE  TALL HIGHLANDER , Alexander Cameron , entered the cabin first . He flung Stuart 's saddle bags on the floor and walked over to a skincoveredcouch . He thrust his moccasined foot under it and dexterouslyrolled out a cask of brandy . Henry Stuart sat down on the couch and bending over felt of the muscles of his back . " It must be five hundred miles , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed it to him . " Nearer seven hundred , " he said . Stuart frowned , still feeling his back . " John assured me that I would find the first hundred miles a torture . The rest of the journey would be pleasurable . " He gave a dry laugh . " His predict ions were reversed . I found the first hundred miles endurable . The rest , " he waved the cup at Cameron , " ah , Master Cameron , the spirit was willingbut the flesh was exceeding weak ! " He looked about the room . Cameron was said to keep up some state in his home near Keowee but he lived in a clutter here . A pile of skins as high as a man 's head over in one corner was evidently used as a dresser . A hair brush lay there and beside it something that looked like a pomade jar . A pair of boots in the middle of the floor and over in the far corner a heap of garments that looked as if they had n't been stirred for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places neat . His Majesty 's Deputy Superintendent did not follow their example . He eyed Cameron over the rim of his cup . It had been fifteen years since they had met . In his own rooms at Beaufort . John had come by early in the morning with his young deputy who was that day to be dispatched to the Cherokees . Standing at the window Henry had watched them come up the walk , his tall , dark , spry brother  --  that was before John succumbed to the gout  --  and the lank Highlander . Cameron had been pale from his voyage and so thin that his black stockings wrinkled on his legs , Now he was stouter , almost as dark as an Indian and wore no stockings , or breeches , either , nothing , in fact , but his flap and a necklace of the longest bear 's claws Henry had ever seen . His brother , John , had told him that young Cameron  --  he always spoke of him as young though the fellow must have turned forty  --  would be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now that they were face to face he found himself embarrassed in the presence of a man who bore himself so much like a savage . " Still he never wore breeks in the Highlands , " he thought . Aloud he said politely : " Do you reside at Chota all the time now , Master Cameron ? " The dark face smiled at him . " The Indians call me Scotchie . ' ... I 've judged it best to stay here , since this trouble started . " He turned towards the door and stopped . " The Carpenter and Oconostotawant to wait on you tonight . " " Here ? " " Right now . If it is convenient . " " Had n't I better go to them ? " Cameron shook his head . " You 'll meet the other headmen at the dance  --  they 're giving the eagle tail dance to honor you  --  but this 'll be private . " Stuart followed him to the door and when he had gone , stood a few minutes looking out . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square a bonfire was blazing . As he watched a figure leaped into the air and for a second was spreadeagled against the blaze . The Cherokees often danced a whole night through , his brother said . He put his hand to his back . It was something to be off the trail and under a roof . There had been one morning towards the last when he had thought he was not going to be able to mount his horse . But it would never have done to ask help from the Indians , least of all the tall chief who had ridden beside him most of the way . John had been very emphatic about that . Lying there , his gouty foot propped higher than his head , he had groaned when his brother came into the room . " The trip 'll kill you , Henry ! " Henry had not then been able to imagine the rigors of four months ' travel through the woods . " It 's not a question of my comfort , John , " he had answered steadily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John had groaned again and buried his face in his pillow . The action brought on a spasm with his foot . It was ten minutes beforep337he could talk . " Od 's Leather , Boy ! There ai n't a man in Carolina could take my place with those Cherokee . But it 's better to send somebody of my blood . They 'll make allowance . Just do the best you can , Boy . Stand up to it , if it kills you .. and Henry , try to cut as much of a dash as you can . They think a lot of appearance , you know . " Henry belched , feeling the bear meat he had had for supper lying heavy on his stomach . " Three dark figures were approaching , the chiefs probably , with Cameron . I lc turned back into the house , wondering whether he could remember enough of the language to talk with them . The Carpenter entered first . l le carte to Stuart and held his wrist in both his hands for a moment , then shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he had done this he gently forced Stuart back to the couch , then knelt down before him and drawing off his boots and then his stockings ran his hands over his feet . Stuart , looking down at the naked back it was a warns night and the chief wore no covering  --  noticed that the skin was wrinkled as though the flesh were falling away under it . Well , it was a long time since Fort Loudon fell . . . . Paul Demers had been scalped alive before they cut his arms and legs off . But the Carpenter had taken John Stuart off on pretense of hunting for meat and had guided him three hundred miles through the woods to the Virginia settlements . John Stuart , when he was in his cups , liked to tell how the Carpenter had bought his life from the others , stripping off his coat , his bracelets , his bandoleer and finally giving up his gun and standing there naked down to his flap . The hands that were brushing over Henry 's feet felt hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their touch was tender , too , like a woman 's . " It 's more than the ceremony with hint , " I lenry thought . ' " It 's John 's feet he 's drawing the briars front . " And he remembered how , when he was leaving , his brother had raised up on his pillow one last time : " Egad , Henry , tell the Carpenter I hold him fast . . . . " He murmured the message now , finding to his relief that the Cherokee syllables came easily to his tongue . The Carpenter , recalled to himself , stood back . Oconostota came forward and went through the same ceremony , as did Cameron , though he and Stuart had partedp338only a few minutes before ; then all three sat down on the floor in front of Stuart . Henry had sat down again on the couch . He wished that he had n't but thought it would be undignified to change his position now . He cleared his throat : " Your father , John Stuart , asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has laid him on a bad bear skin . While he lay there , unable to move , enemies came and attacked him . But they did not take his life . He is now on a boat on the great water . These same enemies are the ones who stole your powder . Your father could not come through the woods himself but he sent me to you , with more powder .... " He stopped for breath . In the pause the Carpenter spoke : " Who are these enemies ? Mounseers ? " Henry looked away , to the papers he had spread out beside him on the couch . He could hear his brother 's voice : " You will have a devil of a time with them , Henry . They wo n't understand how the British can fight among themselves .... " " They are British , " Henry said , " but they are had people who go against their king . There are many now in South Carolina and among the Long Knives , too , I hear . " " That does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men make war on each other . Why not white men ? " " I am for the King , " the Carpenter said boldly . He laid his hand on his breast . " It is now many winters since I heard the talk of my father , King George . But it will stay with me , as long as I live . " Henry looked at him sharply . " It is well known , Atta Kulla Kulla , that you are staunch to the King , but tell me this : why did you sell the land on the Kentuck river to the North Carolina people ? It is that has made much trouble . " " I am growing old , " the Carpenter said , " I could not travel through the woods to my father 's house . " " You travelled all the way to Cross creek to look at the goods . " Atta Kulla Kulla glanced at Oconostota and one corner of hismouth crinkled in a smile . " Henry , " he said , " hear the truth . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no use denying the white men anything . They are like their own flies . A swarm comes . The people beat them out of the town , turn around and anotherswarm is upon them . Does a man spend his life fighting flies ? Ip339wanted them to have land of their own to sit down on . Maybe then they would leave us in peace . " " And you , Oconostota , " Stuart said , " why did you put your hand to the treaty ? " The war chief stood up . Ile took several steps about the room . Suddenly he stopped . He looked down at his own right hand , then flung it out before him . " I value my life no more than that of a dog , " he said , " but I can never make war again . " Cameron 's black eyes swung to the war chief 's face and stayed there . The Carpenter spoke softly : " I have known that for a long time . " " It has not been a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winters . The winter that Round O was killed I stayed in my hot house all the dark months and I thought much . The thoughts I thought in those dark months stay with me . . .. " " That you can not ever again make war ? " the Carpenter said . Oconostota shook his head . " You are a wise man , Arta Kulla Kulla , but you do not know my heart . You think that in those months I examined myself and cane to the conclusion that I was not a fit leader . Or you think that I am now too old to lead a war party . Either way you talk like a fool . At this moment I would not delegate my power to any man in the Nation , except perhaps to your son , the Dragging Canoe , who is as much of a man as 1 was in my prime . " He looked at Stuart suddenly and smiled . " 1 have seen you , a child , in Charleston , " he said . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stuart shook his head . Oconostota bent his eyes on the floor . " It is a pity . There were no looking glasses then such as the voting men now carry about their necks , but I have seen my shadow in the water or reflected on copper and I say there was none like me in the entire Nation , and has been none since , unless we name the Dragging Canoe who as I say is a fine looking fellow .... " " Do not name him , " the Carpenter said . " My son already has too great an opinion of himself . " Oconostota laughed . " Perhaps you think that I , too , have too great an opinion of myself ? There was a time when I would have agreed with you . I will tell you when it was , when I stood with you on that hill in the woods and watched our towns burn . Fifteenp340towns they burned and the cornfields around them . You and I both suffered great hardships that winter , going about naked and starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantly I examined myself to see how I had failed .... " " You laid siege to the fort and the fort fell , " Atta Kulla Kulla said impatiently . " It was another swarm came then and burned our towns . I tell you they are like flies .... " " They are like flies , " Oconostota said , " but it is not that only . It is the war medicine . It no longer has power . " Atta Kulla Kulla looked at him . " That thought has come to you too ? " he said quietly . " I have never believed , since I crossed the great water . " Oconostota inclined his head . " You are a strange man , Atta Kulla Kulla , and I think have never been truly religious . I , on the contrary , have been a religious man all my life . It was that made me such a great war leader . " " What has changed your heart ? " " The passage of time , " Oconostota said . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived through the siege , from the very moment I struck the war pole . On the Path the war bundle never touched the ground but was always borne high . The place of ambush was chosen well . We rose up and killed and scalped till our hands were sore with holding the knives . . . and yet when we should have been dancing over our scalps we stood in the far woods and watched our towns burn . . . . All that winter and for many winters afterwards I examined myself , thinking that there must have been some impurity , some want of skill . But time has changed that . I look back on my youth . The man I see is not myself . I can judge his actions as I would judge those of any other young man brought before me and now that I am no longer Oconostota I know that in him the Nation had such a war leader as is seldom found . . . . It was not the leader . It was the war medicine that failed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never believed that it has power against the white man , " Atta Kulla Kulla said , " since I crossed the great water . " There was a long silence . Alexander Cameron got up and stepped softly to the east wall where he stood looking out . Finally Atta Kulla Kulla spoke : " It is not now with us the way it has been . Some of the youngp341men no longer look to the war leader . They say that they will make war themselves and get their lands back . " " Led by your son , the Dragging Canoe ? " Stuart said . " He wants to make war , yes . But first he says we must give back all the white man 's gifts . The guns , the blankets , the cloth , the powder that has been coming into the Nation since before he was born , he says we must give them all back .... " " The Real People will never do that , " Stuart said harshly . " I do not know , " Atta Kulla Kulla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been . " The Scotchman suddenly turned from the wall . " There 's a band of men just come in to town , " he said . " It is the ambassadors , " Oconostota said . " The great chief , Cornstalk , is arriving in Chota tonight , with delegates from the northern nations . "  |p342HENRY  STUART took the conch shell and held it up to his mouth with both hands . The drink was hot and bitter . He recognized it as the sacred black drink , made out of holly berries , and remembered just in time to spit some out on the ground . Light raced in a long streak up the trunk of the big elm and lost itself in the dusk of the branches . An Indian moved farther back from the fire without taking his eyes off the man who stood in the cleared circle speaking . There must be five or six hundred of them here in this square . When he had been last in London he had met at one of the coffee houses the editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to describe the scene before him ... . The massive old woman who had given him the drink went stooping on along the line . Nancy Ward . She was called the Ghigau and he understood that her power in the Nation was enormous . It was she who had waved the swan 's wing in the exercises that had preceded the Eagle Tail dance , and now it was her duty to serve the sacred black drink to the headmen and important visitors . The hot drink was making the sweat start out all over him . He took his handkerchief from his sleeve and wiped his face ; then , fearingthe Indians might consider the action undignified , he thrust it hastily away . Egad , Henry , try to cut as much of a dash as you can ! He sat up straighter . . . . But no matter how straight he sat or how impassive he kept his face during the ceremonies  --  the Eagle Tail Dance had lasted two full hours  --  he was not one to cut a dash with Indians  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of St. Mary 's church . Young Priscilla Lane sweeping him a negligent curtsey while she delivered her aunt 's message . He could see beyond her all the time the other girl laughing over her shoulder . " My compliments to your aunt but I shall be unable to dine at the Retreat on Sunday . " And then something had made him add " By that time I shall be among the savages . " He could hear the two of them tittering as he moved away and could have told whatp343they were saying , that he did not look the man to be entrusted with such a mission . The Mohawk ambassador was rising and walking out to stand beside the linguister , a thin , wizened old man with white tufts of eyebrows . His belt was of white wampum with black strings attached . He spoke in a high , reedy voice and the young linguister imitated his every gesture and even the tones of his voice . " I suppose there is not a man present who can not read my talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the wampum over his hand so that the beads caught the light and sparkled "  --  these white beads are our people who were at peace . The black beads are the Long Knives "  --  his voice rose even shriller --  " the Long Knives who came into our towns without provocation and killed our people and the son of our greatly beloved ratan , Sir William Johnson .... " So Sir William Johnson 's son had been killed ! He had not known that before . Sir William Johnson 's influence and prestige were enormous . There would almost certainly be the devil to pay among the northern Indians . . . . He looked away from the speaker . the black drink was having its effect on hint . I le did not feel the heat so much now and there was a kind of singing in his blood . Even his eyesight was improved . The people , the trees , all seemed fixed in a cool , luminous light and yet when he bent his attention on any object he was capable of observing the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a nick no wider than a hair in one nostril . It gave him a spirited air as of a hound sniffing the wind . The Raven of Chota was accepting the belt from the Mohawk ambassador . A straight , tall fellow with something of his uncle 's look about him . He was mentioned always as Oconostota 's successor . Did Oconostota really have any regard for hits ? l le had not mentionedhim once last night , when they had had that strange , confidentialconversation ... . Atta Kulla Kulla beside him gave a sudden grunt and leaned forward . He too leaned out a little . The great Shawnee chief , Cornstalk , was rising . He had heard his brother say that he considered this chief the most dangerous man among all the tribes . At the battle of Point Pleasant two years ago he had commanded the allied armies , fighting them in lines like white men . He was speaking in a grave melancholy voice : " The Shawnees once possessed land reaching almost to the sea- shore . Now they have hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand that had been hanging at his side came up , trailing something . A belt of wampum , twice as long as the Mohawk belt , twice as wide and of a deep purple colour . Atta Kulla Kulla was sitting back as if he had seen what he expected to see and there was no need to look further . " It is a war belt , " Stuart thought . " The others were ordinarymessages . But this is a war belt . " The boy with the nicked nostril moved his head slightly . His dark eyes were so full of light they looked as if they might spill out of his head . Stuart looked over his shoulder into the crowd . Everywherethe same steady stare fixed on Cornstalk . One or two were spitting on the ground , a sure sign of excitement with Indians . " . . . The French have long seemed dead but they have risen . They have supplied us with guns , with powder , with lead for bullets . It is not too late  --  if we fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to you six years ago . It is time to take it up .... " The purple belt slid through Cornstalk 's hand and lay , a great , swollen snake at his feet . He was detaching a little panikin from his belt . It flashed in the firelight as he turned it upside down . ' What poured out was crimson , a steady stream settling on the snake 's body in one great wound . The boy in front of Stuart was spitting in a frenzy ; then suddenly he leaped to one side . A big man was making his way forward , Atta Kulla Kulla 's son , the chief of the Great Island . He held something in his hand , four hairy objects strung like a child 's toy on a string . Two were yellow , the third brown ; the one at the end of the string was grey . They whirled in the wind of his approach . One of them turning over disclosed the circling hoop , the fresh painted red skin . Stuart turned to Atta Kulla Kulla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Charleston ? " " On the Kentuck , " Atta Kulla Kulla said softly . " They are young men and did not love to return empty-handed . " The Dragging Canoe handed the string of scalps to Cornstalk and stooped and picked up the long belt . " I am for war , " he said in a loud , grave voice . There was a yell . A warrior rushed out from the crowd and hurled his tomahawk at the flag pole . It struck near the base . He ran nearer and began running round and round the quivering pole , hisp345head thrown far back , his wide-stretched mouth releasing shriek after shriek . One of the northern delegates suddenly pushed forward . He fixed beady eyes on Stuart and uttered harsh , unfamiliar syllables . " What is he saying , Atta Kulla Kulla ? " Stuart asked irritably . " I can not understand what he is saying . " The chief turned and gave his ironic smile . " He is saying that you have forgotten that I saved your brother 's life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the Cherokees ammunition but you want to keep it till it falls into the hands of the Virginians . " Stuart looked up . Dragging Canoe was looking at him . He spoke in a voice that carried above the shrieking : " Our brother has brought us no belt but he has words for us from our Father . Listen ! " " Stand up ! " Atta Kulla Kulla hissed . Stuart got to his feet . " The red men do not understand the written talks of the white men . Even so the white men do not understand the red men 's belts . But I know this . . . " To his dismay he felt his voice crack and grow shrill . " Ambassadors have come to you from the north , urging you to make war . If your Father , Captain Stuart , were here he would tell you not to listen to these men . . . . What has he always advised you ? To consider well before you act and get talks from those who have your welfare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before another moon . They will march through the Creek country . The Creeks and the Chickasaws have each promised to furnish five hundred men . We will have an army large enough to invade the whole frontier . And while the Rebels arc fighting you here on the land , they will also have to fight men who will be in boats on the sea . They will have no chance to escape . You can destroy them all . . . . " Cornstalk had been standing with his head a little bent . I lc raised his head now and through lowered lids eyed Henry . Henry looked back at him . The black eyes were hostile and incredulous . his own eyes went to Dragging Canoe 's face . He took a step forward . " The northern nations have proper white men to direct them but you Cherokees have not . If you go over the border now you will fall on the King 's friends as well as his enemies and then . . . " He was about to say " And then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he must not bring up that possibility . Searching for a word he stared out over the crowd . The boy with the nicked nostril had moved out from under the elm tree . His eyes met Stuart 's , then sheered away . Not black but a clear , glancing brown . But he had an Indian look for all that , rapt , unseeing . Stuart took a fresh breath . " I ask you only to wait . The troops are on the way . . . " He heard his voice roll on , making sentences easily , and all the time thought of a sorrel mare he had had as a boy , how when sometimes he would lean his check against the satiny cheek and cup her nostril in his hand , the nostril would flutter wildly and the brown eye he looked into would stare past him while the head jerked from side to side . " I am not the man to talk to them , " he thought . " I can not make them listen , " and felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside him , with Oconostota . " Has my brother said all that is in his heart ? " Atta Kulla Kulla asked . " Yes , " he said , " oh , yes , " and followed the two old chiefs through the crowd out of the square.  |p347OFF  TOWARDS THE EAST the forest was as light as day  --  they had builtup another fire in the middle of the square and were dancing around it ; but here in the cabin it was dark . I lenry Stuart sat on the reed couch , leaning forward , his elbows on his knees . His eyes fixed the dirt floor , his lips , moving , shaped broken sentences . Ever since the two old chiefs had left he had sat here like this while phrases of the speech he ought to have made formed themselves in his mind . He knew as well as any man the conventions of Indian oratory . A. reference to their glorious past , then a graceful allusion to the tie that bound his brother to them- the northern delegates had accused him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atta Kulla Kulla or Oconostota , perhaps to both . I le would have had them in the mood to listen then . Instead he had plunged into the heart of the matter , telling them what they should do , all but threatening them . Yes , he had been as near as anything to threatening thou . I Ic had pulled himself up just in time and after that had become incoherent . No wonder Atta Kulla Kulla had stopped Into . " I am not the man to handle them , " he muttered , " not the man for the mission , " then sat upright on the reed couch while the hair prickled over his scalp . The yelling that accompanied the dancing had for a long time been steady and ominous . But in that moment a new sound had risen and hung above the other yells the way sheet lightning might crackle over a forest . He sat there on the couch and felt the hair of his head sink down slowly like the ruff on a dog 's back . He got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellinghad started afresh . That other sound might not come again for a few minutes , might not come again tonight . 1 Ic kicked one of Cameron 's boots aside . Cameron was out there with them now . He had caught sight of him only once in the crowd and then his face had seemed drunken , with the eyes gleaming . An Indian in all but color . He would get no help from him.  | He walked to the west wall and looked out between the logs . It was not so light here where the house tossed its wavering oblong of shadow over the green thicket . Elderberry bushes mostly , some of them as high as a man 's head . The Indian children or some smaller animals had made runways through all the brake . A man might slip out of town through one of these brakes . He looked up over the trees and found the north star . The Watauga country must lie northeast from here , over beyond that great elm . Nearly ten thousand people in those settlements . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kulla said , but there must still be many who were loyal to the King . The sound came again , more prolonged this time and with a quaver at the end that it had not had before . The first time he had felt it in the hair of his head , but now in the pit of his stomach . They were dancing over those scalps that the Canoe had brought , probablyre-enacting the taking of them . When an Indian got ready to scalp an enemy he put his foot on his neck and catching hold of the hair gave the neck a twist that usually broke it before he ran his knife around the scalp . A good warrior could give that twist of the neck at the same time that he raised the scalp holler . . . . If they fell on the border they would take hair where they found it , women and children as well as men ... . He stood quietly regarding a spray of elderberries that thrust up beside the wall until the cry had died away . A sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in and was standing near the doorway . A big woman with grey-streaked hair , the one they called the Ghigau . He made a motion for her to be seated . She dropped down on the floor . He walked over and sat on his couch . They sat there looking at each other . Her eyes were very bright under her dark hair . There was something about the wide mouth that reminded him of Atta Kulla Kulla . Well , she was his niece . She was speaking . " You have left the council ? " " The red men do not understand the white men 's written talks . Even so the white men do not understand the red men 's belts .... " She was smiling . She knew that was not the reason he had left the council . A remarkable family , that of the Paint Clan . John had said once that all the brains of the Nation were concentrated in that one tribe . The excitement of the drink had died out of him . He was tired.  |p349He  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and what good did it do ? If she were not the Ghigau he would take her by her fat shoulders and walk her out of here . " You are for the King ? " she asked suddenly . He stood up . " I am His Majesty 's Deputy Superintendent . " He gestured towards the papers that were still flung down there on the couch . " I am preparing my speech for tomorrow 's council . I have no time for talk with women . " The dark eyes lighted into amusement . She got to her feet . " You will not make any more talks in council . I heard Atta Kulla Kulla and Oconostota talking , planning how to get you out of the town . " " This is the peace town , " he said , " and Atta Kulla Kulla is chief here , not a crazy woman . " She did not say anything for a long time , only looked at him . Her eyes were large and full of light . You could distinguish the pupils from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and suddenly it was as if she knew all that was in his mind , as if they had been talking together for a long time . I Ic vent towards her . " I do not care for that , " he said . " I am not afraid . . . . But my brother . . . I was to hold them back from war . . . " She was leaning towards him and now her lips were set against his cheek . Moist and firm . Against them his own flesh must feel withered . It had been a long time since a woman had kissed him . She had drawn back , still smiling . " I know the white men . I have loved them for a long time . . . . Listen , I Henry , the Dragging Canoe is leader now and he has struck the war pole . The young men are leaving the square to start their fasts .. . . He nodded abstractedly . " It will take them three days .... " She came so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease on her hair . " Give me a talking paper , " she whispered . " There is a white man outside will take it to the Watauga . " " Who is he ? " " One of the traders . " He had turned from her and was unstrapping his saddle bags . He had mixed ink only that morning and there was a fresh made quill . He found the roll of paper and sat down on the couch and using his saddle bag for a desk , began writing : " To His Majesty 's Loyal Subjects in the Settlements on the Watauga and on the South Holston and on the Nolluchucky , Warn-ing ....  --   |p350RION  LAID his crop by on the tenth of July that year . The next day he and Frank started girdling trees for another acre of new ground . They were working in the bottom in the late afternoon when they saw dust pinging up through the bushes on the other side of the river and knew that somebody must be riding along the trail . It had been several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Watauga . This rider might be coming from there . They put their axes down and walked over to the ford . The rider came on at a trot . When he got to the ford he pulled his horse up and let him drink . Rion had sat down on a stump and he called out now across the water : " Light and set awhile ! " The stranger raised his head . A young fellow , and he had been on the trail a long time ; his face was streaked with dust and his yellow hair was matted with dust and sweat . He fixed bloodshot eyes on Rion . " Your name Outlaw ? " " That 's right . " " You know a fellow lives around here named Wagner ? " " His house is right over there . You could see if it war n't for the trees . " " Well , I got something for him and you too . " He rode over to where Rion sat and handed him a paper . Rion was unfolding it slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : Fort Lee , July I I , 1776 . " Dear Gentlemen : Isaac Thomas , William Fawling , Jarot Williams and one other have this moment come in by making their escape from the Indians , and say six hundred Indians and whites were to start for this fort , and intend to drive up the country to New River before they return . JOHN SEVIER. "  | " John Sevier ? " Rion said . " That the young fellow come out here from Virginia last year ? " " It 's Captain Sevier , " the messenger said , " and I do n't know when he come or where he 's going . But him and James Robertson and Charles and a lot of others have done forted up on the Watauga . You better go to Amos Batons ' . They 're building a stockade there . . . . " He paused and looked at them sharply . " They was another letter come to Charles Robertson 's about two weeks ago , " he said . " Who 's it from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children where they was swinging on some grape vines and said , Git that to your pappy . ' It was signed by the Indian agent . " " Well , what 'd he say ? " " Said the government was going to land troops in Florida and march them up through the Creeks and Chicksaws . Said they was five hundred warriors promised from each , besides the Cherokee . And said all that was loyal to the ling must put their hands to a paper Charles was to send back to hint .... " Rion looked into the boy 's green eyes . He laughed . " Has Charles got many marks on the paper ? " The green eyes lighted . " He ai n't got around to drawing it up yet . . . . What 's the name of your neighbors up the river here ? " " Mulroon , " Rion said . " There 's a man and his sister . How much further you going ? " " Up above the head of the island  --  if this horse holds out .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell him , " Rion said . They watched him splash through the ford and up into the woods , then they looked at each other . " I reckon we might a known this was coming , " Rion said . " Well , we better get up to Fatons ' . Will you step over to Jacob 's ? Do n't let Sarah bring everything she 's got . It likely wo n't be but a night or two . " He went up to the house . Cassy had just come in from the garden with a split basket full of snaps and had sat down under the big trees to string them . The children were playing a little way off under another tree . As he came towards her she smiled and tilting the basket a little showed him a handful of new potatoes lying among the green beans . " I just grabbled one hill , " she said , " and look what I got . " " You ought n't to a done it , " he said mechanically . She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his own , except for a white triangle on her forehead  --  she had an old cap that she wore when she worked outdoors . Perspiration had pasted the fine , young hairs flat against this white skin . All at once she became conscious of them and put her hand up and brushed at them with impatience , then as if fearing that he might think the impatience was for him she looked deep into his eyes and smiled . " What you been doing all evening ? " she asked . He looked over her head towards the house . The door was open . He could see all the way inside . The bed , jutting out from the east corner , took up most of the space framed in the doorway . Above it , running almost the length of the wall was the shelf that held their few dishes . Gassy always kept this shelf neat but it struck him today that there was something different about it , and he realized that it was not the shelf but the bed . It was spread with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only day before yesterday . He was about to tell her that it was handsome but other words came instead . " Honey , we got to go up to Eatons ' , " he said and let his hand fall on her shoulder . He felt a muscle jerk up in her shoulder and then the whole shoulder grew rigid . She answered his tone rather than his words . " What 's the matter , Rion ? " " They was a fellow come by a minute ago said there was some chance of Indians coming . " She was on her feet and turned about so that she faced him . " Indians ? " Her eyes went quickly to the woods as if she thought the Indians might already be there , then she was looking at him again . " What do we have to go to Eatons ' for ? " she asked quietly . " They 're building a stockade there . Everybody 's coming in . " She started towards the house , pausing once to look towards the children , then running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going swiftly about the room , taking clothing down from the pegs . " I got time to run in the garden and pick some more snaps ? " she called as he entered . He shook his head . " Better just take what you got in the house . ... Gassy , I 'm going to turn the cow and calf together . Therep353wo n't be room for cattle up there and if there was we could n't feed ' em . " She turned around . The look he dreaded showed for a second in her eyes . " How long you reckon we 'll stay ? " she asked . " Wo n't be more'n a few days . Maybe just one night . " He went outside and turned the calf out of its pen and unlatched the door of the little smoke house , and took down two sides of meat and slipped them inside deerskin sacks . There was some room left in the sacks after he had put the meat in , so he took them into the garden and filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grazing on the edge of the woods . I le tolled her to him with a wisp of grass , bridled her , and tying the two sacks together , flung them across her back . Gassy was coming out of the house , some garments thrown over her arm , dragging a sack of meal . 1 le took it from her and loaded it on the horse . While he was doing this she ran to fetch t he split basket from under the tree . " I 'll take it on my arm , " she said . " These snaps 'll come in handy for supper . " Malcolm and his little , black-haired sister had come up and were staring at the horse and his load . " Where you going , Daddy ? " Malcolmasked solemnly . Rion laughed and held out his arms to Sarah . " Want a ride ? " She laughed and he swung her up on top of the load . As soon as he saw Sarah up there Malcolm wanted to ride too ; so Rion settled him beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of hard on old Gal , " Gassy objected . He laughed . " Do n't either one of ' cot weigh more'n a fly . " He led the horse around the corner of the house . The old hen that Gassy had put out this morning was scratching for her new brood right in the middle of the path . She went flying out of the horse 's way , fhe chickens scuttling behind her . Gassy looked after them sadly . " Poor things ! I was aiming to go out and feed them . Rion , you reckon I got time ? " " Naw , " he said and then disturbed by the sound of his own voice he added soothingly : " They 'll git along . Chickens can always pick up a living . " " What you going to do with the mare ? " " Turn her out soon as we get there . She 'll come home . " There was the sound of voices from the front of the house.  | " It 's Jacob and Sarah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I forgot all about ' em . " She looked up at him suddenly . " No , you did n't . You sent Frank to tell ' em . It was you sent Frank , war n't it ? " " He walked over there on his own two legs , " he said drily . The Wagners came , leading a loaded horse . Sarah and Frank were arguing about something that he had made her leave behind . Jacob paid no attention to them but walked by himself . He held his gnarled hands in front of him but they moved continually as if he were just picking something up or putting it down . Rion felt his spirits suddenly lighter . He walked close to Jacob and poked him in the ribs . " Well , it looks like we no sooner get settled than we have to move , do n't it , Old Man ? " Jacob dodged aside without looking up . " They ought to a let them Indians alone , " he muttered . " Where 'd you be if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Carolina . " Jacob did not answer . Rion did not look at Cassy but he could feel her eyes on him . " Well , they 're building a stockade up at Amos ' , " he said cheerfully . " Indians ca n't get over that . " They pushed on up the hill . Rion kept thinking of Sevier 's letter . Isaac Thomas . . . . He remembered that fellow from the Shoals ... escaped from the Indians . Things must be tight if they would n't let traders go in and out . . . . Six hundred Indians and whites .. . to drive up to New River ... . That other letter , signed by His Majesty 's Agent . Suppose he had put his name to it , put his name to it and just stayed there in his cabin and when the Indians came poked a paper at them saying he was loyal ? He spat on the ground . " I 'll take my chance with the rest , " he thought , " only they had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't no business doing that . " They were at the top of the ridge . The pines gave way here and the laurel began . They approached Amos ' house . The laurel bushes around it were slashed and bent and the muddy ground  --  there had been a heavy rain the night before  --  had been trampled deep by the feet of men and horses . They emerged from the thicket and stood in front of the house . A close slab fence ten or twelve feet high started from its wall and was built out ten or fifteen feet towards the spring . Men were work/ing there now . Two or three were riving logs while others set the king post the fence would turn on . From off in the woods came the sound of axes and then all of a sudden the crash of a falling tree . Malcolm , who had stopped still in his tracks , started . " Daddy , what 's the matter with Uncle Antos ' house ? " " He 's building him a fence , " Rion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nothing else ca n't get over it . " They stepped over a pile of logs and made their way in behind the stockade . A stockhouse was going up , and men were setting posts for the fence that would join it to the other cabin . Rion saw the white insides of the oak slabs first and then he saw the people . A mort of them , spilling out of Antos ' house and milling around in his yard as thick as ants . Under the persimmon tree a woman had a fire going and was cooking something . Near-by a crowd of children were playing " I Spy . " There was hardly a spot in the whole enclosure where somebody was not standing . He and Frank led the horses over near the fence and unloaded . Rion drove both horses outside the enclosure and gave them a slap to start them home . When he came back he found Jacob and Sarah sitting wearily on their bundles and Cassy standing wit la the children clinging to her skirts . " This ai n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dis ai n't de place . " Cassy bent and kissed her . " Yes it is . There 's Aunt Jane comingnow . " Jane and Amos were coming towards them . Jane took Sarah in her arms and stood there holding her . Amos was dripping with sweat and looked as if for once in his life he had been doing smile work . He gestured with an axe he held in his hand . " I been riving out boards for ' em . But Abel Lyles he 's spelling me whilst I get my breath . " Rion grinned . " Looks like you would n't have to do no work with all the force you got around here . " Amos pushed his hat farther back on his head . " Man , they been coming in here since yesterday before daylight . " " How 'd they git here ? I do n't see no cattle . " " First ones come with a yoke of oxen . Drove their wagon right up under the window . Was figuring on stabling the oxen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon out in the woods and we built a pen down there on the the run for the cattle . There 's some of the boys watching down there now . What 'd you do with your stock ? " " Left ' em to range . " " The Indians 'll get ' em sure . " " They may . But I did n't see no sense in bringing them up here . Could n't get enough feed for all these cattle to save us and if things get tight we 'll need the room . " " If things get tight enough we 'd need the cattle , " Amos said . Rion laughed . " Shoh , we 'll never stay in here that long . Indians ai n't enough patience to siege a place . " Amos was looking at two men who were picking their way across the muddy ground . " Hi , Captain , " he called . " Here 's a man done just come in . " Both men turned and started towards them . " Which one 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em ? " " I mean which one 's in the lead , " Rion asked impatiently . Amos leaned down and pulled a blade of grass . " Well , I reckon Jim Thompson 's seen more Indian fighting than any man here , but that Captain Cocke , he 's an up-and-coming fellow , I tell you . " The two men skirted a sheet that a woman had just spread on the ground , and stopped in front of them . Thompson was a tall middleagedfellow with blue eyes set close together above hairy cheeks . Cocke was younger , with a fair complexion and inclined to be a little plump . He greeted Rion heartily . " I 'm glad to see you , friend . Where 's your station ? " " Down here at the foot of the ridge , " Rion said . Cocke pursed his full lips . Rion had for a second the impression that he was trying to look older than he actually was . " That makes a hundred and sixty-nine fighting men , Eaton , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bledsoe 's . " " He 's as much of a man as any of them , " Eaton said . " Ever done any fighting ? " Cocke asked Rion . Rion grinned . " Not with Indians . I was in a kind of battle once , over in North Carolina . It did n't last long . " " I was in North Carolina last year , " Cocke said , " recruiting militia . " " Have any luck ? " " I may say I had . Two companies I brought back . Some of thosep357lads are in here with us now . " He seemed suddenly to realize that Thompson had not spoken , except for a brief " howdy " and he addressedhis next words to him . " It 's a good thing some of us realized last year what was coming , Captain . If we had n't begun organizing militia then where would we be now ? " " I never thought the Cherokee would rise , " Thompson said . " I 've known that old Carpenter for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rise . " " Where 'd you see your service , Captain ? " Rion asked boldly . Cocke cleared his throat . " Colonel Preston issued my commission in August two years ago . Before that I was in command of a body of irregular militia . " Thompson had half turned away from them and was watching the work on the stockade fence . " ' There 's that boy of Bledsoe 's now , " he said as a slight figure suddenly emerged from the willows by the spring . " We 'd better see if he has any news , " Cocke said . They walked away . Amos stood chewing his blade of grass and looking after them . When he turned to Rion one side of his face was drawn up in a grin . " Now ai n't that something ? " he said . Rion shook his head . " Sometimes a fellow like that ai n't so had after he gets a little age on him , " he said amusingly . Amos laughed and threw his grass blade from hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " We better go down and rake a hand on the stockade. "  |p358ON  THAT DAY , the twentieth of July , Rion went on guard around three o'clock . He had patrolled the rifle range a half hour before , and looking up at the block house had seen a musket poking through the loop-hole he was to man . When he got up in the loft he found that the musket was held suspended in its place by a chunk of wood wedged against the butt . The guard , Bill Durroon , lay flat on his back on the floor , snoring . Rion trod on the man 's hand as he took his place at the lookout . The fellow sat up , rubbing his eyes . " Anything coming ? " he asked when he had finished yawning . " If there had been you 'd never known it , " Rion said . Durroon got to his feet . He stood for a second looking over Rion 's shoulder at the bit of woods and sky framed in the long slit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said and yawned again . " If I was home you know what I 'd be doing ? " " Sitting on your butt if you war n't laying down , " Rion said . Durroon laughed . " I 'd be eating watermelon . They was three in my patch big enough to eat but they did n't thump just right . Wish now I 'd picked them . Varmints probably got ' em by this time . " He went down the ladder . The man at the other loop-hole laughed . " I started to wake that feller , " he said , " but I did n't see much use . They do n't really need but one man up here . " " Maybe not , " Rion said , " but he ought to be a good one . " The man turned away from his loop-hole and leaned back against the wall , his rifle swinging in both hands . " You think them Indians are coming ? " he asked . " I would n't be in here if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quid of tobacco and spat on the floor . " I believe if they was coming they 'd a been here before this . We been in here over a week now . It ai n't the week I 'd a chosen to be cooped up either . My corn was late this year  --  had to plant three times before I got a stand . I was fixing to give it the last working the day the word come . " 1 " It ai n't a good time of year to be away from home , " Rion said . The fellow  --  his name was Bulloch and he came from Reedy Creek  --  frowned . " If them Indians do come they 're likely not to come to this fort . Spread through the settlements and tear up the crops and steal the cattle  --  that 'd be more like ' em . " " You got to take a chance on that , " Rion said . " I do n't know about that , " Bulloch said . " I ai n't said much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd take my oldwoman and walk out of here this day .... " " And you and your old woman maybe not have a hair on your head time night come , " Rion said shortly . " Maybe not , " Bulloch said , " but 1 'd do it , I vow I would  --  if it would n't cause trouble . " Rion did not answer and the other man turned back to his loophole . Rion stared through the narrow s l i t - in the logs off to the cast . He had this loop-hole every dine he did guard duty . The scene he looked out on had come to be as familiar to him as his own dooryard . Down below the ridge on the left veiled now by a light haze , was Pendleton 's rich valley . On the right was the smaller , shallow valley in which his own home lay , and rising up beyond that Bays ' Mountainthat always looked to hint like a loaf of bread just taken out of some monster oven . Standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other valley but for the most part he looked straight ahead along the backbone of the ridge . Just beyond the rifle rank a laurel thicket began . A bridle path ran through it , due cast . The eve could follow the path for a long way when it suddenly vanished in scrub pine . There was quite a lot of scrub pine before the ridge sloped clown into the heavy growth that marked the horizon . That bridle path ran on to join the Warriors ' ' Frail . It was along that trail that the Indians would travel from their towns . Ile had picked out a certain spot , marked by an unusually tall cluster of pines , where he imagined the two trails joined . Always when he came on guard his eyes went first to that spot hut not once in these eight days had he seen so much as a wisp of smoke , and yet he felt that the Indians were on their way . But they might not come for days . In that case there would be hell to pay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in this fort many more days . Supplies were not running short . There was plenty of meal and side meat still and , thank God , they had had enough sense to fence in the spring . There was water in abundance and even milk for the babies  --  Amos ' three cows came up to the gate every evening to be milked . It was not the lack of anything they needed , or even sickness  --  a lot of the babies had been sick but you had to expect that  --  no , it was none of these things but just that a restlessness had come over the people , men and women too . It had come all of a sudden , two days ago . At least that was the first time a man had turned to him and remarked on what he would be doing if he were at home . It was that same day that he noticed two men dropping their work to stand staring off into the woods . He knew what they were thinking , that there was nobody to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the way this fellow , Bulloch , felt . He did n't know but that he 'd feel the same way  --  if he did n't know that the Indians were coming . He started , then leaning his rifle against the wall thrust his head out of the loop-hole . A woman was coming up from the brush there on the right , walking along calmly with no effort at concealment . He leaned farther out of the loop-hole . It was Cassy . She had a split basket full of greens in her hand . She had been down in Amos ' sallet patch cutting collards . He was about to call her when a hand fell on his shoulder . He turned around . Amos had come to relieve him . He did not stay to talk to Amos but went on down the ladder . The room below was full of women . He made his way through them hurriedly , on tiptoe , not glancing towards the corner where John Bunham 's young wife lay on a pallet , moaning . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean out of her head ever since . He wondered whether the fever had been brought on by fright and confusionor whether she would have been taken that way anyhow ... . Cassy 's third child was due in four months . But they would be out of the fort and back home by that time . He stepped down into the yard . A little shape fluttered up from the shadow of the wall and glided beside him . A girl about ten years old . She wore a single garment , a man 's deerskin hunting shirt , belted at the waist by a leather thong and so old that in places the hide had broken and showed her dirty flesh.  |p361He  looked down at her and smiled . " Where you think you going ? " The expression of her face  --  a wide , curious stare  --  did not change but the sound of his voice seemed to startle her . She dropped back and hid behind a pile of logs . The enclosure was full of women , gathered in knots under the few trees or huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ground which had been muddy when they came in was as dry as a bone and every blade of grass , every shrub had long since been trampled down into the dust . As he walked along he cast a glance up at the sky . Not a skim of cloud in all that burning blue . Jane was sitting on the ground under the persimmon tree . She had her knees spread wide and Sarah lay across them , sleeping . He had hardly thought about the children in the last- few days , but now it occurred to him that Sarah might be sick . He looked at her anxiouslyas he came up . She was pale and there were purplish shadows under her closed eyes . " Ai n't anything wrong with her , is there ? " he asked . " She ai n't been right for two days , " Jane said . " She ai n't got fever ? " " It 's her bowels , " Jane said . She , was looking past hint as she spoke . Cassy was coming towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet her . " What was you doing out on the range ? " he asked . She looked at him calmly . " I had to get some greens , the baby 's bowels are bound up . " She stepped past hint and laid a stick on some ashes that were smouldering under a pot . " I 'm going to cook these greens now . " She glanced at Sarah slyly . " Do it this time of day and wo n't so many children be coming around . " Jane shifted the baby on her knee . " I saved a piece of corn bread to crumble in them , " she said . Rion felt awkward and inexperienced , hearing them talk so authoritatively . " Reckon that 'll cure her ? " he asked . " Ai n't anything better , short of physic , " Jane said . Rion heard a slight noise and looked up . The strange little girl had crept out from behind the logs and vas standing about ten feet away , staring at them . She was very thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was matted like the fur of some mangy animal and might have been almost any color . Her blue eyes werep362set wide apart in the dirtiest face he had ever seen . But her face was no dirtier than the rest of her . The skin of her neck , her bare arms and feet and legs , all were crusted thick with dirt . He made a motion towards her with his hand . " Why do n't some of you all take and wash that little critter ? " Gassy looked up , smiling faintly . " She belongs to that wild fellow . Comes and stands here like that for an hour at a time . " She crooked her finger and whistled as if to a dog . " You want to come and set with us , honey ? " The child whirled and was back behind her pile of logs . Rion laughed . " I ai n't got time to go over and flush her . " He looked towards the spring where some men were gathered in the shade of the willows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing cards , but now they were all on their feet , moving around . " They 's somebody come in , " he said abruptly and hurried off down the slope . On the way he passed a wild-haired , ragged looking man sitting alone on a log . His face was crusted with dirt . His hunting shirt was slick with grease . Rion remembered seeing this man the day they forted up . He had asked several people who he was but nobody seemed to know  --  he had just drifted in the day the blockhouse went up . This must be the " wild feller " Gassy had spoken of . He felt sorry for the child if this man was all the dependence she had . He looked to be as near a beast of the forest as a man could get and stand on two legs . The men were gathering in a circle around the spring . He pushed in among them . The Bowyer boy was stretched out full length , his head bent over the water . As Rion came up he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Must be three or four hundred , " he said , and then his head went down again and you could hear him greedily lapping . " Where 'd he come on ' em ? " Rion asked the man next to him . " Up on Cockrill 's Run , " the man said . The boy hurriedly plunged his whole head into the pool , then stood up . Beads of water sparkled on his eyebrows and lashes and on the young hairs of his beard . He drew his hand across his mouth , sighing luxuriously as if he could hardly forget his thirst for a moment , then stood straighter . His grey eyes shone through their wet lashes .   " I would n't a found ' em , " he said , " if I had n't climbed up on that bluff . I was scouting around there all day yesterday and I lay down and slept in a hollow not three hundred yards from that run . I got up long before it was light and was getting ready to go over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cut through that way , when I come on this big bluff . I decided I 'd go up there and have a look around before I left . I had to set up there a while before it was light and then all of a sudden I leaned over and there they was , thick as hops . " " What was they doing ? " Jim Thompson asked . " Sleeping , but they had some guards out . ' , east I saw one coming up from the run . I took out then . " There was silence . It was broken by William Cocke 's voice . " Gentlemen , I think we had better go out to meet them . " Jim Thompson looked up over the stockade into the woods . " That gives ' em a mighty good chance to slip up on us , " he said . " What did we build a blockhouse for if we ai n't going to stay in it ? " Rion glanced around the circle . Nobody was looking at " Thompson . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ai n't a thing to him , " Rion thought , " and they 're wondering why he 's so brash . " He suddenly felt like laughing . The fellow was scared ! His full lips were trembling and his voice when he spoke had been louder than there was any need for . " lie 's scared to stay , " Rion thought . " He still wants to do something big but he knows it 'll have to be quick . " And then he forgot his speculations . Cocke was walking in among the men , speaking in a lower , more persuasive voice : " They wo n't attack us here . They wo n't attack any of the blockhouses . They 'll break up into parties and spread through the settlements . There 's a lot of folks did n't come in . It 'll be hard on them , to say nothing of the destruction of the crops .... " A tall man threw away the stick he had been whittling on . " I do n't want those bastards to get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em and get it over with , " another man said . " I reckon if we have to go outside to find ' em we 'd better do it . " Thompson looked at John Campbell . " What is your feeling , Captain Campbell ? " " You and Captain Cocke have seen more Indian fighting than I have , " Campbell said courteously . " I 'm willing to abide by your decision . "   Thompson looked around the circle at the men and then at the women who had come out of the blockhouse and with the children were pressing up through the young willows . He made a motion with his hand as if to drive them back but he let it fall abruptly at his side . " Go get your powder , " he said . Men were swarming up the rise to the blockhouse . It was full of women . Rion dove through them and got to the high shelf in the east corner . He had five pounds of good French powder stored there in a big gourd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it there where anybody might get at it but.he had said no , it was best to leave it in full sight ; then if anybody took it they 'd know who they had to reckon with . He lifted the gourd down and tilting it began to pour the fine black powder into his horn when he felt somebody come up behind him and a hand was laid lightly on the arm that held the gourd . He kept on pouring until the horn was filled to within an inch of the rim , then he looked around into Cassy 's face . He smiled . She dropped her hand and moved back a little . " You all going out now ? " " Right this minute , " he said and slapping her lightly on the back ran out of the house and down the hill . The scouts had gone on ahead . The captains were drawing off their companies . Rion had been elected a lieutenant in John Campbell'scompany . He had men under him . He walked over and called out in a loud voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming in two long files . Thompson at the head of one , Cocke at the other . The order came suddenly : " March ! " Grinning boys held the gates back . They passed through and were on the rifle range . Their feet crunched on the crisp , burned soil . They were over the range and into the laurel . The path had been widened by wagons and sleds . Plenty of room for two files of men . " But maybe we ought not to be in files , " Rion thought . " Maybe we ought to each pick us a tree . " The laurel ended . They were in the pines . They could be in here . Yes , there was plenty of cover for them in here . But would they have had time to get this far ? Cockrill 's Run where the Bowyer boy had seen them sleeping , was all of six miles . He was a fast runner , that boy , and he had come on them before it was goodP365light . If they had slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started they would not have had time to get this far . Suppose they had got wind of how many men there were in the fort and had turned tail ? It was funny , ever since that boy had brought the word , he had not been able to see them , to see them coming through the woods the way he had been seeing them for eight days . But that did n't mean anything , except that now he was busy his mind did n't have time to run on foolishness . He glanced overhead . Not more than an hour of sun left . If they did n't come on them before dark the men would be turning back to the fort . He stared over the butternut-colored shoulder in front of him and almost prayed . If a dark head would show there on the other side of that hickory or to the right behind those rocks . The man in front of him suddenly broke step . " What 's that ? " " Firing , " Rion said . He leaned out to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Biggs . " The scouts came flying up the path . " We run into ' cm , " Davis gasped . Thompson was beside them . " I low far , boys ? " " ' Tai n't no distance  --  if they have n't fallen back . " Thompson was back at the head of his file , yelling : " Ready ... . March ! " They were off on the double quick . Our of the scrub pine now and down into the flats . Master oaks , beeches and hickories . Room between the trunks for a man 's garden patch . No cover here . Where could the savages have gone to ? Somebody ahead sang out . " Right about face ! " The man in front of Rion turned and stared . " What for ? " " I do n't know no more'n you do , " Rion said and left his men and ran up the line . Up there the men had already broken ranks . Cocke and Thompson stood off to one side , talking . Rion went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Thompson looked up . " Captain Cocke thinks we 'd best turn back . And I do n't like the looks of this place much myself . " He jerked his hand towards a great oak . " No telling how many of them hiding behind them trees . " Rion heard the pad of a moccasin behind him . Robert Edmiston spoke . " I thought we came out to fight ? " Cocke looked at him . His face was flushed and his eyes hadp366narrowed but he spoke calmly . " It is a question of where we 'll fight . While we 're waiting here they may have slipped around us and started for the fort . " His voice rose , grew sharp . " Do you want ' em to come on the women and children ? " Thompson looked worried . " I reckon that 's so . Besides it 'll be dark here in a few minutes . " He walked over towards the men . " Dress on the right , " he shouted . Rion went slowly back towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out of earshot Edmiston spoke . " He was all for coming out to meet them . Now he wants to turn tail . " " He 's a white-livered son of a bitch , " Rion said . " Ai n't got no business to command . " Edmiston looked at Rion . A grin came on his lean , rather solemn face . He turned around and called out in a loud voice : " Let Captain Cocke go back to the fort and look after the women . The rest of us 'll stay here . " Cocke heard him and stopped in his tracks . His rosy face went pale . He threw his head . " Sir , do you impugn my honor ? " Edmiston shook his head . " I just said you ought to go on back to the fort . " Bulloch , the man from Reedy Creek , stepped up beside Edmiston . He looked from one man to the other , then he said : " There 's some of us think we ought to stay and fight as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right , " came from somewhere in the crowd . " Let him go back , " somebody else shouted . Cocke paid no attention to any of them . He stared at Edmiston and said in a low , furious voice , " I served against the Shawnees , sir , which is more , I think , than you have to your credit . " Edmiston spat on to the leaves and looked up with a sly smile . " Maybe you 've had enough Indian fighting . " There was dead silence . Cocke was walking with little , quick steps across the rustling leaves . He stopped when his pale , furious face was within a few inches of Edmiston 's . " Sir , my judgment is one thing , my military reputation another . You are at liberty to question the one but not the other .... " Rion had slipped around through the crowd and was standing beside Thompson . " Had n't you better pull your cock off ? " he asked  | " I know Bob Edmiston . He ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thompson shook his head . " That 's a good boy , that Cocke , but he gets his back up too easy . " He raised his head suddenly to look off through the trees . " Here they conic , " he said . There had looked not to be any cover in all that wide , flat place but there was : a draw , far off to the left . The Indians were rising up out of it , spreading through the trees as they came . Thompson was shouting : " Dress on the right . Dress on the right ! " Men were drawing up in front of a big beech . Rion was running towards them when Bob Davis carne at him , yelling . " Too far out . They 're going to outflank us . " Rion looked up . The Indians were pushing to the left , skirting some big trees . Davis was already back of the line , on a little hill , still yelling , beckoning with his left hand . Rion ran straight at the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were coming after him and now they were funning on the hill . He drew a long breath and looked at his printing . The Indians had seen them and had Stopped , striped clowns huddled in the shade . A big chief sprang out from among them and made for the white men 's centre . The others crowded after him . Rion looked down the line . The men were steady . Then suddenlyBill Edmiston and Bob Davis broke from the line . Edmiston looked back over his shoulder . " Conte on ! Do n't wait for ' cm ! " Rion ran up beside them . The Indians were conning on fast ; the big chief still in the lead . You could see his face now . Black stripes quivering over the stretched , red mouth ; a big nose . The one that had been at the Island , the one that had made all the trouble . He brought his rifle up and aimed , high , for the belly button . He heard the report and in the same instant wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tomahawk out of the loam . Frank , beside him , turned white eyes . " You got him ! " Rion shifted the tomahawk to his right hand and ran forward . The chief was on the ground . The blood spilled from his thigh , not his belly . He set his lips together , thrust his fist into the place , was on his knees.  | Rion was leaning over to tomahawk him when he felt a hand on his wrist . He looked into black eyes while a knife came up towards his throat . He held the fellow off with his knee while he swung the tomahawk out and then up . It sliced in like butter . The Indian fell backwards on the leaves . Rion stepped around the body and saw the chief being carried off by two men . He kept twisting in their grasp to look back . His mouth was still stretched wide with his shouting . His eyes were fierce through their glaze . " He 's done , " Rion said , and turned quickly , hearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank grinned and slumped to the ground . He was crawling off towards a log . Rion looked back at him once and moved on . Off towards the right Thompson 's men were closing in on a bunch of Indians . Rion ran towards them . When he got there the Indians had been beaten back through the trees . " Follow ' em , " Rion screamed , " do n't let ' em get away ! " The Bowyer boy jumped over a dead Indian and was beside him . He pointed to the streaked leaves . " This way . They went this way . " They ran forward . An Indian was crawling between two trees . Rion cracked his skull with his tomahawk and they went on . Jumpingover bodies , dodging between tree trunks . The way was sticky with blood  --  they passed two more who had to be finished off  --  but nothing walked upright through the trees . The Bowyer boy spoke , thickly , from a swollen mouth . " Might 's well go back . " " I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He laughed and wiped his brow with a bloody hand . " Boys , they 've done turned tail ! " Rion looked at the body that lay nearest him , a young Indian with a hole plowed through his chest . There was another one ten feet away . He ran over to it . An older man , wounded in the lungs : the leaves all around him were flicked with red froth . He raised his head and looked over the grove . Prone bodies everywhere and everywhere the trails of blood . He started running and suddenly it was like some day in summer , when going into the field , he would find a melon that had not been there the day before and then another and then another , and would run from row to row , counting the long , dark shapes . So now he ran over the field and the bodiesp369he came on were to him like the fruit he had been used to number on that summer day . Six he found in one patch and then , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a log , three in a cluster . No more in sight . He ran , panting up to Thompson . " Twenty-one , " he cried . " There 's one right there , " Thompson said . An expression of disgustcame on his face . " Look out , Man , what you stepping in ! " Rion looked down . The Indian had been killed with a knife . He lay half turned over , blood still oozing from his torn entrails . It was seeping into Rion 's moccasin . He laughed and standing on one foot took the moccasin off and shook the dark drops down on to the leaves . " We let it out of ' cm , did n't we ? " he cried . " We let it out of ' em ! " P370THE BAND led by the Raven left Chota on Tuesday . Five days later they were in the valley that was called Carter 's from the man of that name who kept a store there . In the late evening they dropped down into a hollow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen leaves . A spring , welling out from under a rock , sent a bright runnel through the brown drift . The Raven was at the head of the line . He came into the grove at the same swift trot that he had kept up since early afternoon . Archy thought he would pass through the water without stopping , but on the brink of the stream he reached up and touched a low-hanging crooked limb , then gave the grunt that meant that he had found a landmark . In the same instant a man rose up from where he had been sitting at the foot of a tree and came and took him by the arm . As he made the gesture his face showed for a second over the Raven 's shoulder : a black mask striped with red . In this dim light it was hard to tell who he was , but Archy saw the scar that lifted the upper lid of his right eye a little and he knew that it was Noonday . He felt angry . " He has not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not as good a hunter as the Owl or as myself for that matter . Why was he picked for a scout instead of us ? " And then he forgot himself , listening to what was being said . " ... five . . . in a cabin . . . a mile from here . " " Why are they not in the fort ? " The black mask cracked wide in two . " They came out to get water . " The Raven turned and threw his hand up with fingers spread wide . The men broke their rank . Archy stood back until the older warriors had drunk . Then he stepped up the slope and knelt and drank the water where it bubbled out between two flat green rocks . When he had finished he dropped down in the leaves beside the P371Owl . He could still feel his gullet string where the clear , cold water had washed it . They had already drunk three times today but that water had come from the hollow reeds that each man carried slung about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that warm , sweetish stuff and not get the refreshment he could get from one drink of water cold from the spring . He sat quietly , touching shoulders with the Owl as they leaned against the same young beech . Dusk was already in the hollow . In that soft light the warriors ' painted faces were greyish blurs except for the glint of an eye-ball every now and then or the thrust of some feather when a man turned his head . The Raven and the scout still stood together , talking , but the other warriors all leaned as he and the Owl were leaning against some tree or lay back against the slope , legs and arms sprawling . All except the Etissu . He sat on a fallen tree , upright , his hands on his knees , looking straight before him , his war bundle that on no account must ever touch the ground , sticking out from the middle of his back like the handle on a pot. " ... a hundred , " the Raven said , " a strong fort . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder against Archy 's . He turned his head . His eyes gleamed ; his lips drawn back in a smile showed his strong , white teeth . I Ic had had that same expression on his face all day . Others had noticed it . Archy had seen one greyhairedwarrior look at him curiously and then with an arch glance direct another man 's eyes to the mirthful face . " Atta Kulla Kulla 's son is happy now that we go to war , " he said softly . The Raven and Noonday had come over and were sitting down beside the old warrior , Humming Bird . Captain Gist got up from where he had been sitting and joined them . They discussed the situation in the fort . Day before yesterday Noonday had climbed a tall tree and looking down into the fort had seen men handling sacks of corn and had counted ten or twelve head of cattle . " But there is little water , " he said . " How do you know ? " Gist asked . " The cattle low . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had not needed it . " " How long have they been in the cabin ? " the Raven asked . " Two days . They have a butt full of water on runners just out- side the door but they can not get the sled across the field . One of us watches and shoots every time they step out . " " Why have you not captured those men ? " the Raven asked sharply . " Three of you and they only five . " Noonday was silent a moment ; then he said : " We are two now . The Northward is dead . I have hidden his body under some leaves but I am puzzled how to dispose of it . Shall I bury it now or shall we build a scaffold and expose it so that the birds may pick the bones clean ? " " That is an old custom , " the Humming Bird said in his deep voice , " and a burial acceptable to a warrior . " The Raven did not seem to want to put his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death ? " he asked . " At the cabin , " Noonday said sullenly . " We went there this morning just before day , whooping as loud as we could . But they were ready and shot the Northward through the chest as we broke from the woods . Doublehead and I turned back then  --  to help him . " " To help him ? " the Raven said . He seemed to repeat the words mechanically and yet with a tinge of sarcasm . There was no answer from Noonday . Archy could hear old Humming Bird 's heavy breathing but the old man did not speak and neither did Noonday , who after a few seconds got up and walked away . He was taking his place quietly in another group of men . He would not mention to them what had passed between him and the Raven , and as long as the Raven was leader he would obey him , but once off the Path he would call him to account . One of them would probably die for what had been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Raven meant to asperse Noonday 's courage or had the emphasis on " help " been accidental ? Archy wished that it were lighter so that he could study the man 's face . Was he nervous or merely preoccupied , trying to plan the attack as skilfully as possible ? He had a reputation to live up to . A man did not get the name Raven unless he had showed not only courage but wisdom in battle . He thought of the Owl as he had seen him a few days ago , throwinghimself on the ground , howling and digging his fists into his eyes . That was when he discovered that he and Archy would not join the party from the Great Island but must go with the band fromtP373Chota . And yet last night , when they had stopped to eat and drink , the Owl , sitting beside him for a few minutes , had whispered that now they were on the Path he had no regrets but was as happy to follow the Raven as he would be to follow his brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Archy thought , and words he had heard in the town house came to him : " On the warpath do not make new plans . Think only how best to obey the leader . " The Raven broke the silence . " Humming Bird , what do you think ? Shall we pass this cabin by and go straight to the fort ? " " I think we had better stop and take it , " the old warrior said . " But the noise of the shooting will alarm the fort . " " They are on guard anyhow , " Gist said . Archy looked up . On the march he had not been near Gist at any time . He had almost forgotten that this white man was with them until now when his voice came out of the half-dark . The Owl leaned forward suddenly . " And the men from the cabin might come up on us from behind , 0 Raven . " " That is true , " the Raven said thoughtfully . A lighter note came into his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owl ? " " Burn it , " the Owl said eagerly . " If you allow , I will be the one to hold the torch . " " We will decide that when the time conics , " the Raven said . He stood up and called out the word that meant that the men had rested enough and must now take to the Path again . It had been dark for several limits when they stopped on the edge of the clearing . It was not a large clearing and die cabin stood square in the middle of it . There was no light showing anywhere but men 's voices were heard . " Bill , how long we been in here ? " There was a creaking sound as if the man addressed were turning over on the floor . " Two days , I figure .... It was just about this time of night we made the break , war n't it ? " The other man laughed . " And I did n't want to bring that sack of meal along ! Old Lady Ashcraft came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it . " " That 's the way with women . They look ahead . It 's their nature . "  | " And look always for the worst . Well , Old Lady Ashcraft war n't disappointed . . . . She sure is one thin old pee-turkey . That Miller girl is the prettiest of all them young ones , ai n't she now ? " " I ai n't hardly noticed her , Arthur . " " You take a look at her when we get back , " Arthur said and began to sing : In Scarlett town where I was born There was a fair maid dwelling Made all the lads cry " Wellaway ! " Her name was Barbara Allen . The warriors were taking cover on the edge of the woods . Archy , lying behind a stump , another man close beside him , heard the song and remembered how Rion used to sing it , coming home from church at night , letting his voice ring out how it would , not caring whether or not he disturbed the neighbors. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town a-drinking , You gave a health to the girls all around And slighted Barbara Allen ? The fellow was getting the verses mixed , having Barbara scorn the dying man before she got to his bedside . He moved his head restlessly and felt the coarse hair of his comrade 's dangling scalp lock brush his cheek . He drew a little away from him and stared off across the clearing . Something round and dark came up there against the cabin wall : the water butt hoisted up on a sled . They must have another butt full inside or they would not have held out this long . For a second it was as if he were in there with them . Four bearded men sprawled on the floor . Another , the one who had been singing , leaned against the west wall . He had a flaxen beard . His head , cocked a little to one side , was thrown far back . He was still singing though there was no noise to be heard anywhere , except off in the woods a mockingbird 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the sky . There were not as many stars out as there had been a while back and the air was softer . It might rain and even if it did n't , it was going to be a black night . Too black to know what you were doing . Perhaps they should have waited till dawn . But that would mean putting offP375the attack on the fort still another night . The Owl was right . They could not leave those fellows here and go on to the fort . Five men , probably the best marksmen in the lot . They would be on them like catamounts . Four men came out of the woods , a long dark object swinging between them . . . . All along the wood 's edge men were rising . He picked up his rifle and stepped out over the hard ground . Almost as dark here as in the woods . Would the door be in the middle of the wall or would they have to feel for it ? His free hand , swinging out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He froze in his tracks and breathing softly stared at the black wall . There was a patter of feet . Four men ran past . The black , blunt log they carried soared up to crash against the wall . There was a shout inside and then no sound . Four heads bobbed back past him , then the log was rising main . Wood splintered under the stroke , and there was the whish of leather ripping from its hold . Dark heads clustered thick as the warriors put their shoulders to the door . He shifted his rifle to his other hand and drew his tomahawk from its thong . He could hear the white men against the door , cursing , grunting . Suddenly there was the sound of fire . In the flash the Humming Bird 's face showed , a writhen mask , and then the old man reeled off , groaning . The white men still had the musket barrel thrust through the doorway but three warriors had hold of it . There were more splintering sounds . The door went down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard his own voice raised in the war cry . The doorway was clear of men . He stepped around the half fallen door and was into the room . I le put his hand out and felt nothing but dark . But off to the right men were struggling . He went towards the sound . His hand grazed a naked shoulder . He stepped back and in that instant a man 's anus came up and took him around the chest . He sprang and broke the fellow 's hold , faced about and swung his tomahawk up , then down , as hard as he could . It struck on flesh and hung . A glancing blow , in the shoulder , he thought . He pulled the blade out and would have struck again when a musket went off . The glare showed him the white man on the floor , a Cherokee bending over him . Sobbing he stumbled off , hack- ing , striking nothing . And then tow flared up on the hearth and all the room was light . He stood still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweat . The room was full of Cherokees . From the corner groans came but no white man was standing . In front of him the Owl bent , straddling a man . He was rising , holding something in his hand . Archy 's eyes went past him to the prostrate body . There was a tomahawkwound in the chest but yes , the shoulder , too , was soaked with blood . He looked away . " He was mine , " he thought , " mine if I had n't stepped off ! " and then he saw bright drops of blood fallingon the toe of his own moccasin and realized that some one had come to stand beside him . He stared for a moment at the floor where the blood was spattering thick , then let his eyes travel up past the dangling scalp to the Owl 's face . Words came to him . " You have done well , Brother . " The Owl turned to him . He was breathing hard but his face in the dying glow of the fire showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . The Raven was coming towards them , holding a scalp in his hand . He slipped on a smear of blood , righted himself with a bound then turned and gave a quick look about the room . " They are all dead , " he said . Somebody flung on another handful of tow . The knot of warriorsover in the corner parted . A bearded , middle-aged man was propped slackly against the wall , another man 's bloody body fallen across his knees . A little way off a young , German-looking fellow lay on his back staring at the roof . His arms , widespread , made him look as if he had just lost his balance and toppled down . It was his yellow hair that the Raven was fastening to his belt . The glow was dying . The Raven finished tying the thong that affixed the scalp , threw his musket to his shoulder and trotted out of the room . He went west , the warriors filing after him . On the edge of the clearing they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole deep enough to hide a man 's fist in , blown in the side of his head . They carried the body a little farther into the woods and left it , covered with leaves , under some rim-rock . Half an hour later they stopped in the deep woods beside a spring . The Creek Killer was there , waiting for them . He had beenP377lying up in a clump of dogwood within earshot of the fort . " There had been much talk when the shooting started at the cabin . For a few minutes it had looked as if a band would go out to help the men in the cabin but the ones inside had evidently thought better of that . At any rate the gate had not opened . He could swear to that , for his post had been on that side of the fort . Noonday had something at his belt , larger and whiter than any scalp could be . He was holding it up . " This will help the fire , " he said . A man came suddenly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I , et Inc set the torch , " the Owl said . " 0 Raven , let me set the torch ! " An older warrior spoke . " The Owl is Man-Killer now . Let him touch off the fire . " The Raven turned to the Owl and gave him his directions . He and the Creek Killer were to lie hid in the woods on the other side of the clearing . When they heard tiring they were to start for the fort . The shooting would draw the settlers to that side and give the Owl and his companion time to get the fire to burning . The Creek Killer grunted his approval . " It is better than flaming arrows . That is too slow . " Archy felt a hand on his arm . " Come with me , " the Owl whispered , then said aloud calmly , " , lv elder brother , the Bear Killer , goes with us . . . . Na-hwun-yu- , tra-i , 0 Raven . " " Hwi-la-hi , " the Raven said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They followed him . They came out in a grove of elms . ' Ihe ground was covered with young limbs that had been lopped off for browse last winter . On the edge of the clearing the brush had been raked into a long pile . Archy stooped and felt the frail boughs ; they were as dry as tinder . The Creek Killer was dropping down behind the brush . I he stretched himself out full length beside hint . They looked over at the fort . A watch fire leaped in the southwest corner . ' I he fort stood up big in its glare . A high stockade fence with a blockhouse at every corner . Room for fifty head of cattle in there besides the people . They were fixed for a siege , all right , if it were n't for the water . Something showed up suddenly on one of the roofs , moving along like a man 's bent form . " They keep a guard along there too ? " he whispered.  | " They are putting out blankets , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dew out of them . " The Owl had been off in the woods cutting a pole for his torch . He came up now and dropped down beside them . " In the morning ! " he said and laughed , and then broke into excited whispering about the fight that was just over . " I got in there and I struck about but I could not find anybody . I thought , There are not enough to go around . They will all be killed before I get a chance . ' " " That was just the way with me , " Archy said , thinking of the arms that had come around him in the dark and then of the blow that he had struck . " I found mine with my foot , " the Owl said . " I heard the fall and thought somebody else had brought him down and then he caught at my ankle and I was on him . Aieh ! I was on him . I grow excited now , telling you about it , but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was a good one and then my foot went to his chest and I grasped the hair and pulled , and I heard his neck snap and knew that I had made the coup . " His voice sank . " But it is hard to take a scalp in the dark . I am afraid this one will come out small when it is dried . " " They 'll all know you took it in a night fight , " Archy said . His voice sounded harsh in his own ears . The contrast between his own warm tones and Archy 's grating voice must have struck the Owl . He reached out suddenly and laid his hand on Archy 's wrist . " I hold you fast , " he said . " I hold you fast , " Archy said and lay quiet , staring at the fort . When they had first come up it had seemed that there were no sounds from there but now you could hear sounds a-plenty . The measured footfalls of men on guard , and occasionally a rumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in there , and once a child 's fretful wail rose and was promptly hushed . Off in the woods the mocking-. bird was still going it , imitating a catbird now . How many times had he and the Owl , pretending that they were mockingbirds , run through all the calls they could give ! This was the night they had been waiting for so long . Well , things had gone well for the Owl , so far . . . . A few minutes back he had been jealous of the Owl , wishing he would stop his talk . But now he did not care so much . It was the Owl 's touching him like that and reminding him that they were brothers , or maybe it was just that he had had time top379think it over . Anyhow it seemed right that the Owl should be the first to get a scalp . He was the chief 's son , and he was one of the Real People . He , Archy was just a Hoobuk Waske , though they never reminded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were one of them . And he himself did n't remember except once in a while . If he got something to take back he might never think of it again ! Something soft and wet flicked his nose . Rain ? Or a bird flying past ? He looked overhead . The slay had changed in the last half hour , dark grey now , with no stars showing . Still , no other drops were falling . It might hold off a long time or not come at all . He was turning to ask the others if they had felt anything when a gun went off in the woods on the other side of the fort . There was another report and then another before a gun answered from the fort . It did not sound like a rifle but like some sort of blunderbuss . There was the crackle of broken twigs . " I'hc Owl and the Creek Killer were off with their loads of brush . Archv took up as much as he could carry and went after them . They spread our from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the fort . The fire in the enclosure burned bright , pushing the shadows back , throwing a ring of light far out over the hare , burned ground . Across this band of golden light wavered the blunt shadow of the nearest blockhouse . If they could get into that shadow . . . . The firing came faster . There were shouts front the fort , and rising and echoing back from the woods , the Cherokee war cry . The Owl was in the light and running . Archy tripped on a clump of sage , was down , then up . The light struck full on his face , washed over him , then the shadows closed in again . He was running , with the Owl , beside the long stockade fence . Rosy glints of light struck through the cracks . In the cabins backed up against the fence children were crying but as yet there was no firing from this side . With trembling hands they heaped their brush high against the boards . The Owl was on his knees , his musket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a flash and a tiny snake of fire curled bright through the.tow . The blaze spread and now all the twigs were crackling . Archy stared at the boards , on the other side of which cattle were lowing . Slabs of green oak and butternut . Would they burn ? The Owl drew his torch from the fire and running off a few yards sprang like a cat up the side of the fence and on to the roof . The Creek Killer raised a startled face . " They will shoot him ! " There were lumbering steps in the blockhouse and then a gun went off . There was no cry from above , only the sound of somethingfalling and then the torch , still flaming , shot out over the edge of the roof , and after it the Owl 's body . Ile fell heavily , lay still for a second , then was turning over . Blood oozed from his thigh . He groaned . Archy ran to him , knelt and putting his arm around his back , tried to raise him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crawled towards the burning torch . He had it in his hand and was crawling back towards the wall . A bullet buried itself in the ground beside them . From above came a steady yelling . Archy could hear another sound , like continuousfiring , only it seemed far off . The Owl was at the wall , raising himself up to hold the torch against the green wood . His head went forward . Archy saw the lips puffed out , straining , and then the head went slack on the neck ; the ' ' body slumped to one side . He felt a hand touch his arm . " We are alone , " the Creek Killer said . " They are not coming up . " Archy caught the Owl under the armpits . The Creek Killer took the feet . They ran , swinging the body between them . A sharp pain ran through the calf of Archy 's leg . He looked over his shoulder and did not know whether it was his own blood or the Owl 's that left a trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearing when the Creek Killer suddenly let go of the feet and staggered off . Archy dragged the Owl on into the woods . He was bending over him , trying to feel the wound when he heard the Creek Killer come up behind him . " It was not I that let go of him , " the Creek Killer said . " It was my hand . It is broken , " and he held it up so that Archy could see the blood that flowed down on his arm . Archy told him that he had better try to stop the bleeding with some leaves . He bent closer over the Owl . He was not groaning now . He lay , as Archy had put him down , one arm doubled under him . Archy straightened the arm out and felt of the wrist . ThereP38Iwas no pulse . He let the wrist go and felt the wounded thigh . It was pulpy with blood , and blood was a thick jelly on the leaves . The Creek Killer spoke . " He is dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He sat down at the foot of a tree and after a moment Archy sat down beside him . He realized that rain was falling . They sat in the rain , listening to the shots that still came every now and then from the fort . " The Raven drew off when the rain began to fall , " the Creek Killer said . He sighed . " We have three dead now . I wonder if the warriors will want to bury them or put the bodies up in trees . The Humming Bird himself said that it was a burial acceptable to a warrior . " Archy heard another voice : " And when I am killed tie my body with vines high up in the trees where 1 can watch the enemy and send word .... " He looked up into the high , ghostly boughs of an elm . " In the trees , " he said . P382ARCHY WOKE and at first he thought he was at home in Chota , and then he saw the buffalo hide going up beside him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt an agreeable warmth along his left side . The Fox was curled up in a ball like a dog against his hip . But there was nobody on his other side . When he had come in from his watch , Monon and the boy were asleep there together . He had flung some wood on the fire so that they might not wake cold , and had crawled in under the same robe . That had been several hours ago . He had been cold and very tired  --  for two weeks he had been on watch every night in that same pine grove  --  and he had gone to sleep almost immediately . But he had not slept the night through ; stars still showed through the slit in the tent . Yet Monon had a fire going outside and was bending over a kettle as if she were cooking something . What had got her up so long before day ? He sat up gently , so as not to disturb the sleeping child and slipped out from under the robe . His rifle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pallet . He slung the shot pouch over his shoulder and taking the rifle up went outside . Frost was white on all the rocks and a cold wind blew up from the valley . He turned the collar of his leather shirt up and , shivering , stepped to leeward of the fire . Monon came to him quickly and leaning against him clasped her arms about his neck . " You have rested ? " she whispered . He yawned , stretching back against the encircling arms . Then as the fire warmed his body his faculties awoke . He stretched a last time , put one hand on her shoulder and with the other bent her body in against his . " What made you leave me ? " he asked . Her lips touched his and she drew back , looking over her shoulder . He glanced in the same direction and saw the Dark Lanthorn sitting on the other side of the fire . He let Monon go and went towards her . " I did not see you there , Mother , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was boiling on the fire . " We are cooking rocks , Bear Killer . " " For what purpose ? " " It is for the chief , " Monon said . " He has the shaking and in all the kettles we are heating rocks to lay against him and keep him warm . " " You 'll burn him , " he said . The Dark Lanthorn laughed and Monon gave him a push . " They are wrapped in hides , Foolish One . " The Dark Lanthorn got up and coming over to the fire bent and touched one of the rocks . " It is almost hot enough , " she said . She straightened up and looked at Archy . Light glowed in her deepseteyes and the muscles about her strong mouth quivered a little but when she spoke it was only to say : " You will bring them to me when they are hot enough , my son . " She went swiftly along the path that led to the chief 's camp . He stood looking after her . The expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his had been one of almost disturbing kindliness . Lately she often looked at hint like that . And she made a point of asking him and no other young man to do for the sick chief the things that required a man 's strength . And yet a few months ago she had not liked hint , had only tolerated his presence . " It 's the blood , " he thought and remembered with a little flicker of the nerves along his spine the ceremony that the and the Owl had gone through . " She believes we changed blood . I 'm all that 's left of the Owl . " He turned to Monon . " How is he tonight ? " She shook her head . " They should leave him alone . He is dying , that is all , dying . But they will not believe that the great Attu Kulla Kulla can die like another man . Tonight they have scratched him all over with dawiskula and have given hint to drink of the juice of boiled ferns . It has purged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his years away from him . " " These last few weeks have been too much for him , " he said abstractedly . Her beautiful upper lip quivered suddenly like a child 's , then set in a hard line . She looked away from him at the tent made of skins , at the few cooking vessels that were all they had been able to bring with them when they abandoned the towns . " We live like the beasts in the woods , " she said scornfully . He let his hand rest on her shoulder a moment , then stepped past her to the rock that was his lookout . He took his seat there and stared out over the valley . At first his eyes , tuned to the firelight , could not make out anythingexcept the wreaths of mist floating up from the trees ; then towards the north he found what he was looking for , what had been there when he went to bed . A yellowish grey cloud that had in its centre something bright and leaping . The fires were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Noonday , he had thought that the burning town must be Chilhowie but from up here it looked more as though it were Settico  --  if Settico was not already burned . Night before last that yellowish smoke had extended in a long roll across the horizon with flames leaping up in two places . Three towns at any rate were gone now : Tellico , Chilhowie and Settico . Chota was still standing  --  the white men had spared it out of respect for Nancy Ward  --  but there was not a man , woman or child left in it , only the dogs . He thought of the night the Cherokees had left their towns with children crying in fright and women crying for the things they had had to leave behind . And then he thought of the Beloved Woman who had betrayed their plans to the white men and sitting there on the rock he cursed her , slowly , filthily in white man 's talk . Monon looked at him with bright eyes but did not stir from her place by the fire . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked up at him timidly . " Captain Gist is waiting for you on the path . journey . " He rolled the rocks out of the kettle on to a hide , twisted the hide into a bag and picking it up started along the path . His way led over the brow and a little down the mountainside . Everywhere through the trees low fires burned . Men , women and children , rolled in skins , lay about them , sleeping . This was the encampment of the Middle and Valley people . They had begun coming in here two months ago . By this time all that were not dead or in captivity must be here . His own people , the Overhills , had had warning when they fledp385their towns and had brought horses laden with skins and other householdequipment , but these people had been surprised in the night and their towns burned over their heads .
