txt Europe has come much nearer to agreement on the testing question of division of this yew 's Marshall aid , in the course of the oast few days . Part of the agreement is likely to prove to be a substantial cut in the British share of aid assigned in the original precrisis pattern , rather than an increase ; There arc , however , two big qualifications to make to this news of closer agreement ; 1 . Europe still is waiting upon the American Congress . The real job of division can not be tackled until Europe knows exactly how much is to be divided . 2 . Europe is uneasily aware that the likely amount of aid$3,628,000,000 ? of itself will act ? be anything like enough to keep all or even most of the 19 Marshall Plan participants out of the red this year . It is reckoned that another $1,500,000,000 at least , would be needed to maintain Europe 's present or planned standards of living and industrial activity . More Funds Needed Over here this is interpreted to mean that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery effort , with worldwide repercussions , could be threatened . Unless , that is , other urgent steps are taken to ward off that threat . Some of these steps , including greater freedom for trade and measures to increase economic efficiency , would need to be taken by Europe , But others seen to require action outside Europe . An official statement to the ef ' fect that Marshall aid as planned can not do the job intended , signed by all members of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation , is possible as a result of recent talks in Paris . A statement might be attached to this note informing the Economic Cooperation Administration of de , tails of the final division of aid . It is understood that , partly in return for such " appreciation " of the situation , carrying with it the combined weight of all the western European countries . Britain is willing to accept a reduced share of aid . It is said that Britain is slated to receive what it originally asked for ? $900,000:000 . This would leave it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to bear . a $600,000,000 deficit . These reports from Paris appear to be in line with the interpretation of the much-maligned British note to the OEEC showing a need for $1,500,000,000 worth of aid , as a tactical move . No Actual ' Demand ' Britain , of course , never did actually " demand " a much greater share of Marshall Plan dollars at the expense of the rest of Europe . Such a " demand " would have had little meaning , since it would be the subject to a complete veto by any single one of the other 18 OEEC nations whin happened to object to it . What is more , in the background nd'w is the obvious fact that even if the British share of Marshall aid were increased , it would not altogether solve Britain 's particular problem  --  and certainly not Europe 's . Not only does Britain in present circumstances need dollars outside Marshall Plan aid  --  use of this aid is restricted and three-quarters of Britain 's dollar food buying , for instance , can not be covered by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reserves lies outside Europe . It lies in dollar needs or dollar deficits of lands at the extremities of the far-flung sterling area . Since Britain is by far the biggest trading nation among the OEEC countries and gets the biggest single total of Marshall aid dollars , it is most heavily affected both by the decline in world trade and by a decreased aid program . One result , the British main- tain , has been the tendency to play up the crisis as a British crisis , when it applies to all countries . In the past three months . the world trade of western Europe has been falling at the annual rate of more than $500,000,000 . Belgium 's dollar deficit for the first half of this year is over $100 ; 000,000 , Some 48 per cent of France 's total imports are currently paid for by gift credits from other nil-. tions . Dollars Lost ? Falling world prices and the hold-off in buyina by the United States have resulted in dollar earnings of sterling area countries outside Britain losing $100,000,000 in six months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and our socialist government that are causing the difficulties . It is a world problem . It requires a world understanding of what has gone wrong and how it is to be righted , In London they do not take the optimistic views of the prospects , but they are not pessimistic , either . Many gains have been made in the past year in financial stability , in industrial output and in trade of many countries , they claim . And the dollar problem can be " solved " perhaps in one or the other following ways : Increased European and sterling area exports via increased efficiency . Getting world trade into high gear by legal and financial readjustments . An upswing economy , with United States markets . United States investment in undeveloped territories . Loans from the International Monetary Fund or the International . Bank . Heavy cuts in the world 's buying of ? American products . The last is obviously the least desirable for one and all . At least the world is already agreed on that .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
