All proposals to amend the U.S. Constitution were bottled up for the duration by the Senate Judiciary Committee last week . The Senators explained that they were mindful of the resentment over the adoption of Prohibition while World War I servicemen were overseas . But what seemed more to the point was that they had just tabled the Fulbright resolution . Arkansas ' internationalist Senator Fulbright decided something should be done about the Constitutional provision which allows one-third-plus-one of the Senate to block a treaty . His resolution proposed that treaties be ratified by a simple majority in House and Senate . <P> Last week the House , which clearly wants a hand in World War II treaty-making , was quick to respond to this maneuver of the Senate Judiciary Committee . Bald Representative Carl Hinshaw , California Republican , promptly introduced a brace of resolutions under which the Senate could consider treaties only after the House had approved their consideration and passed validating legislation . Representatives hoped it might start a slam-bang fight over the Senate 's jealously guarded treaty monopoly . <P> Also tied up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vice President to one term ; others to abolish the closed shop , to reorganize the Cabinet . So far as the House was concerned , all these could wait , but the Fulbright resolution was something else again . If it could not be submitted to the voters , it was at least going to get some public discussion .
