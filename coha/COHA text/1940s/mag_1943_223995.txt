GUADALCANAL DIARY-Richard Tregaskis-Random House ( $2.50 ) . <P> This may not be the best war book of 1943-but it is thorough reporting on one of the most dramatic battles of 1942 . Six-foot seven-inch , bespectacled Richard Tregaskis , 26 , is an International News Service correspondent who landed with the first Marine contingents to hit the Solomons . For seven weeks , until he was relieved , he lived with the Marines , became as tough and wiry as any . Jap snipers shot at him . Jap pilots strafed and bombed him . On his way out of the islands by bomber he started to write about it all . In Honolulu he finished his book . <P> Thirteen dollars ' worth of airmail stamps took the manuscript to New York . Within seven days it had been accepted for publication and picked as the Book-of-the-Month Club 's February selection ( with Norman Angell 's Let the People Know ) . Shortly thereafter it had been sold to 20th-Century-Fox . <P> The book 's secret is the simple secret of all good reporting-fidelity and detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guadalcanal is like . Tregaskis ' description of the Battle of the Tenaru River , which he watched while Jap tracers wove a bright red network of visible death around his head , gets its power from the countless sights he remembers and sets down rather than from any comment he makes about them . Excerpts : <P> " The stench of bodies strewn along Hell Point and across the Tenaru spit was strong . Many of them lay at the water 's edge , and already were puffed and glossy , like shiny sausages . Some of the bodies had been partially buried by wave-washed sand ; you might see a grotesque , bloated head or twisted torso sprouting from the beach . <P> " Everywhere one turned there were piles of bodies ; here one with a backbone visible from the front , and the rest of the flesh and bone peeled up over the man 's head , like the leaf of an artichoke ; there a charred head , hairless but still equipped with blackened eyeballs ; pink , blue , yellow entrails drooping ; a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead Jap private , wearing dark , tortoise-shell glasses , his buck teeth bared in a humorless grin , lying on his back with his chest a mess of ground meat . There is no horror to these things . The first one you see is the only shock . The rest are simple repetition . " <P> Tregaskis ' Marines have only to open their mouths to establish their reality . Example : <P> " I saw a circle of Marines clustered about one of the lads who had a reputation for being a demon with the gals . These , he said , were letters from his Number One girl . ' That 's the only dame he could never make , ' said one of his admirers good-naturedly . ' He wants to MARRY her ! ' The Sheik only chuckled . ' F- you , Mac , ' he said , indulging in the Marines ' favorite word . ' The trouble with you is you never met a virgin . ' " <P> Even after the Marines had landed " the sentries were jittery on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time to hear the call of ' Halt ! ' followed almost immediately by volleys of gunfire . " But with the first real fight the cool battle fortitude began to develop . " Down the beach one of the Japs had jumped up and was running for the jungle . ' There he goes ! ' was the shout . ' Riddle the son of a bitch ! ' And riddled he was . "
