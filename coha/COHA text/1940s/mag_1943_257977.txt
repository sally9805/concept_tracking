&gt; In Detroit laundries appealed in paid newspaper ads to the public to do their washing at home . <P> &gt; Many Los Angeles husbands spent Sundays helping wives do the wash . <P> &gt; New customers for diaper service in Washington , D.C. were accepted only on a doctor 's prescription , certifying that the mothers were too ill to wash diapers themselves , or on priorities for war workers . <P> &gt; The secretary-treasurer of a large , labor-short laundry in Portland , Ore . swept out the premises each morning . <P> &gt; In Cleveland one company limited its customers to three shirts a week . <P> The laundry business , biggest U.S. service industry , is unable to cope with war . And summer , its busiest season , is hard upon it . As it valiantly tries to keep the nation 's clothes clean , its profits fall , customer ill will has mounted , the number of lost socks and misplaced towels has vastly increased . In the last two months 100 U.S. laundries went out of business . <P> Increased Wartime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men &; women are busier than ever , often at occupations which dirty their clothes more quickly , there are three main reasons why laundry sales have increased from 1941 's $489,000,000 to 1943 's estimated $600,000,000 : 1 ) more women leave their homes every day for offices and factories ; 2 ) domestic help grows increasingly scarce ; 3 ) new washing machines are unprocurable . <P> Decreased Laundry Resources . Price ceilings , as now fixed , work against most laundries . In many a large city near mili tary centers , Army &; Navy have commandeered whole laundries . New laundry machinery and even replacement parts are difficult or impossible to get . <P> But all these troubles pale before the greatest laundry difficulty : manpower . Even though 75% of laundry workers were always women , no laundry now knows from one day to the next how many employes will appear for work . Labor turn over has run as high as 500% a year ; inefficient workers have halved the laundry 's output per man-hour while doubling the number of customers ' complaints . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with the higher wages paid by war industry . <P> Solutions . The laundries want them selves designated as essential or " locally needed " industry so that their help can be frozen ( this has already been done in 39 cities ) . They declare they can do the irreducible minimum of the nation 's washing only if they abandon all frills and " de luxe " services for the duration . <P> For the U.S. citizen the meaning was clear : shirts will be worn longer , sheets changed less often .
