In Exeter 's big game with Andover last week , the score was 2 to 2 in the ninth , when a storm broke . The last person to leave the Exeter stand , looking mightily disappointed at the tie score , was a man in a battered brown hat and a black Navy raincoat . He was Exeter 's new principal , William Gurdon Saltonstall , 40 . <P> Afterwards , diehard rooter Saltonstall talked about what he would do as ninth head man in Phillips Exeter 's 165 years . Said he : " Exeter has been concerned too much with books and too little with the things you do with your hands . " <P> If Saltonstall has his way , the Exeter boy of tomorrow will spend more time studying music and art ( " and I do n't just mean appreciation " ) and working with woods and metals in shops . Bill Saltonstall , a handy man himself , is tall ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) , lean and gangling , with the same ski-run jaw and long nose as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won letters in football , crew and hockey , and still helps coach the Exeter hockey six . <P> During the war , he served on the carrier Bunker Hill in the Pacific . Later , as a lieutenant commander , he trained other officers in air-combat intelligence at the Navy 's prep school on Rhode Island 's Quonset Point . He decided that they caught on fast because their work had purpose . Says he : " I do n't believe in teaching any course just crammed full of inert material . " <P> Saltonstall , a history teacher at Exeter since 1932 , was just going to bed one night when Board Chairman Thomas S. Lament and retiring Principal Lewis Perry called and took him to the Exeter Inn . There the trustees broke the news . Students heard about it at Sunday chapel . They followed him home . Exeter 's cheerleader called for " nine rahs for Saltonstall , " and had trouble getting it out . Bill grinned . " Just call me Salty , " he said .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
