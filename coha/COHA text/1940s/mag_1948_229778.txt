Last week a call was issued to U.S. churches : on Sunday Aug. 22 they were asked to ring their bells once each hour from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m . The bells will summon Christians to prayer . On that day , in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam , 450 Christian men &; women delegates will begin a meeting that has been called the most significant occasion since the Protestant Reformation-the first Assembly of the World Council of Churches . <P> The Amsterdam meeting had its beginnings back in 1910 , when missionaries of many non-Roman Catholic churches met in Edinburgh to discuss their common problems and the possibilities of cooperation . Among them was a U.S. Episcopal bishop , the Rt . Rev. Charles Henry Brent . In the midst of the proceedings , Bishop Brent suddenly saw things in a new perspective . " I learned that something was working that was not of man in that conference , ' - ' he said later . " The spirit of God . . . was preparing a new era in the history of Christianity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should consider what they have in common . <P> In 1927 Brent and his friends succeeded in mustering representatives of 127 church groups in Lausanne , Switzerland , " for the consideration of questions touching Faith and Order . " Meanwhile another interdenominational group had met in Stockholm under the leadership of Archbishop Nathan Sderblom , Primate of Sweden , to discuss the social , economic and political ills that plague humanity . Both groups called their next meetings in the same year-1937 . Then both conferences voted to set up a joint body , to be called the World Council of Churches . <P> For 14 days this summer the World Council will meet officially for the first time . Churchmen with such polyglot titles as archbishop , archimandrite , catholicos , exarch , moderator , pfarrer , priest , minister , pasteur , professor and elder will worship and confer with laymen of almost every Christian faith but the Roman Catholic ( see col. 3 ) . <P> When the Council 's first meeting ends there will be as many sects and denominations as before ; there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unified high command . But the hope is that a new peak will be reached in brotherly understanding , and that a long step will be taken toward church reunion .
