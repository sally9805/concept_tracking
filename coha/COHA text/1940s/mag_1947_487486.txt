TN 1828 Bronson Alcott , who had .1peddled Yankee notions in Virginia and New York , approached at last , in breathless awe , the city of Boston . It surpassed his dearest hopes . " There is a city in our world , " he was soon to write , upon which the light of the sun of righteousness has risen . . . . It is the same from which every pure stream of thought and purpose and performance emanates . It is the city that is set on high . It can not be hid . It is Boston ! " ' I his was indeed Athens , with culture , Mr. Emerson , and the Athenaeum . In 1855 a more realistic student of " Anglo-Saxon " Boston , himself one of its intellectual glories , declared it the central battleground of all America , " for here the two extremes meet in closest contact , in sternest strife . " To Theodore Parker Boston was Athens not so much because it produced culture as because it generated passion and conflict .

Parker , the far from temperate leader of one extreme , had a name for the other : " Call that opposition Hunker-ism ; call the opponents Hunkers . " Hunkers obliged their foes to show a vigor equal to their own : " Talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells ! . There are a great many bishops who never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome but to the Almighty Dollar , a pope much nearer home . " Nineteenth-century Boston , in short , was a boom town , plenty tough , and thus it made both history and money . By now all this seems far away and long ago . What could have made Alcott lyrical or Parker furious ? Old-family Boston , State Street Boston , proper Boston , is no longer culture or Hunkerism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George Apley , and the old lady who goes to California by way of Dedham . It is peopled with amusing eccentrics , who above all have no relation to present social problems . ' It is an island of complacency , almost as ideal a refuge for nostalgia as Father Day 's parlor . It has achieved the apotheosis of a literary stereotype , a theme for witty books that undoubtedly circulate more copies in Omaha than in South Boston . It ought to be a commonplace of scholarship  --  too often it is forgotten  --  that a literary convention on this level of popularity is primarily a creation of the public that embraces it . The lay figure may bear no close or even any resemblance . to the subject he is supposed to represent ; he is a symbol of what the at , dience wants , not of the fact . Buffalo Bill was an invention of American mythology , only incidentally Colonel Cody . Sometimes the Colonel Cody strives to merge himself with the legend until he ceases to have any self , but often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finds a certain protection , not to say profit , in the existence of his alter ego . t'or reasons that it would take a sociological treatise to expound , the banker and the merchant no longer become heroes very easily . This may be disconcerting ; Hunkers prospered enormously while being denounced as Hunkers , but can they operate with confidence when they are supposed to be on the way out ? Then it begins to appear that the new figure of comedy will do as well as , maybe even better than , the image of the Hunker . Any group will try to survive , by one means if not ' by another . Against a declining economy or against new competitors , if it can be established as quaint and queer , it may remain as a fixture . So Boston sooiet , to judge by the documentation , appears to be offering itself up as a willing sacrifice . Again it is pioneering a stage in the history of the middle Class by arraying itself before the delighted public as a curiosity , an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , of course , it is doing nothing of the sort . But the legend serves , and perhaps internal tension in Boston can ' be handled behind this fa  --  ade more neatly than in Detroit . There is indeed a local idiom , but the realities of Boston , as experience teaches and Mr. Gunther confirms , are astonishingly like those of Chicago . Ultimately one most regrets the vogue of this convention because among readers in other parts of the nation it encourages the superstition that regional differences are fundamental . It obscures the fact that they all grew up in the age of Hunkerism . The latest addition to this literatiZe of Boston is Mr. Amory 's " The Proper Bostonians. " - It is weak on history but rich in anecdote , and written con amore . It is great fun to read for about half of it  --  any half . Thereafter this convention , like any other convention of local-color fiction , like Bret Harte 's miners or Colonel Carter of Cartersville , when kept going too long , becomes repetitious and tedious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
