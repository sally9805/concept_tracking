Harry Bridges ' left-handed grip on Hawaii 's sugar , pineapple and dock workers ( TIME , Dec. 22 ) had never seemed tighter . He seemed coolly confident and was flexing his muscles for another wage fight with the planters and shippers next February . A vice president of the International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union , one J. R. Robertson , had gone out from San Francisco to stir up the shock troops and build up a $200,000 " war chest " ( one day 's pay a month from each of the I.L.W.U. 's 35,000 members ) . <P> But along the coastal slopes near Hilo , Vice President Robertson ran into trouble . Remembering their costly , 79-day strike of 1946 , many sugar workers were bitter at Robertson 's call for " an army of strikers . " He lectured them sternly : their attitude that " the bosses are all right " was " dangerous thinking . " <P> Last week Robertson 's war talk blew up in his face . At a meeting in Hilo , 50 delegates representing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form an independent union . <P> Leader of the walkout was Amos Ignacio , a member of the territorial legislature and head of the I.L.W.U. 's Hawaiian division of sugar workers . Said he : " We 've been smeared enough with Red paint . We have waited for a long time for a denial of Communistic activities by some of our biggest union bosses and we are sick of waiting . . . . We know there are Communists in the union . " <P> Then Bridges ' men got another blow . George Aguiar , a member of the legislature from the island of Kauai , resigned from the territorial Democratic Party , charged that its control on Kauai was in the hands of I.L.W.U. straw bosses . He joined Ignacio 's revolt . <P> The secession caught the I.L.W.U. 's leftist leaders in Hawaii by surprise . Jack Hall , Bridges ' lieutenant in Hawaii , was in San Francisco , presumably talking strike strategy with his boss . Union organizers scampered to Hilo , tried to persuade the 4,000 secessionists to reconsider their stand . But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolt in the canebrakes threatened to spread . If it did , Harry Bridges might be in for an entirely different sort of war from the one he had planned for Hawaii .
