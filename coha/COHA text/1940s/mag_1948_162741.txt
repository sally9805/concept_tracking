The Florence B. , a scallop boat , was scalloping along off the New Jersey coast last week , in 105 feet of water , 50 miles southeast of Ambrose Lightship . Among the scallops the rake dredged up a curious object : a gigantic tooth that would have taken a Paul Bunyan dentist with forceps the size of crossed crowbars to extract . The tooth was 6.5 inches long and Weighed 3.7 pounds . The roots were rust-colored and scaly , but the hard crown was jet black , as if the owner had chewed betel nuts . <P> The scallopers took their catch to New York , where Dr. Edwin H. Colbert of the American Museum of Natural History identified the tooth as the upper left third molar of a mastodon ( a proto-elephant of the Pleistocene Age that tramped North America some 30,000 to 250,000 years ago ) . <P> There are two theories , said Dr. Colbert , of how the molar may have got so far from land , 1 ) The dead mastodon , enclosed in a block of ice , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some geologists believe that during the Pleistocene Age the ocean was lower because the glaciers that covered much of the land locked up so much water . So 2 ) the mastodon may have walked to the scallop bank on its own big feet .
