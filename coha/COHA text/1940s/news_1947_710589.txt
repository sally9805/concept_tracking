txt The Administration is engaged , among tither things , in a world-wide campaign looking to the removal of restrictions on international trade . Yet , in the absence of entirely unexpected developments Congress will complete action this week on a measure which , although it carried the endorsement of the Administration , represents the very antithesis of the policy which the nations of the world , under the leadership of the United States , laid down at London and have been seeking to implement at Geneva . This , measure , which would go into effect on Jan. 1 next , is designated the Sugar Act of 1948 . In 1937 , when the sugar industry was in a state of prostration , with the world price of that staple around 1 cent a pound , the Government stepped in to shore up the domestic situation . It set up , in the Sugar Act of 1937 , an elaborate system of controls , including acreage allotments , benefit payments and domestic and import quotas . Although this experiment in planned economy was imposed upon the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cartel idea to its breast . The 1937 law was enacted to meet the temporary requirements of a depressed , sellers ' market . The situation today is the complete reverse of that , but the economic philosophy of the 1937 law and most of its machinery is to be continued for at least another five years under the forthcoming law . And on this Occasion the legislation has been written , not by the Administration , but by the industry itself . According to Washington dispatches , all of the groups in the American sugar area , including the beet sugar planters , the cane sugar growers , the " off-shore " producers and the refiners , are pretty well satisfied with the pending legislation . This is understandable , since all of them seem to have been well taken care of . In addition to being subsidized , the domestic producers have been given generous quotas  --  quotas totaling about 20 per cent higher than the average output in the decade 1936-1945 . Any possible doubts aS to the beneficence of the measure from the standpoint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including in the measure a provision of the old law which placed a ceiling of 586,000 tons on the amount of refined sugar that might be brought into the country . It can hardly be said that this measure commends itself from the standpoint of the public interest to the extent that it seems to find favor with the industry . Under the original law , for example , the Secretary of Agriculture was authorized to estimate the country 's consumption requirements on Oct. 31 of each year , and then allocate production for each of the domestic areas . But whereas he was specifically enjoined in that Act to avoid underestimating demand , the new Act directs him , so far as possible , to keep in mind the preservation of the ratio of supply and demand prevailing in 1947 . This , of course , is a subtle version of the " parity " principle , with the parity price established with reference to a period notorious as a sellers ' market . In the baking trade it is contended that this provision will mean an addition of 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible addition of $150 millions to the amount paid ; by consumers for bakery items over the life of the Act . Twice now , in two wars , Cuba has stepped in to save this country from a critical sugar shortage which our domestic producers were helpless to do anything about . It is not surprising , therefore , that the consuming public has come to identify its interest in a continuing flow of sugar at reasonable prices with the interests of that country . Cuba , however , was not invited to take part in the formulation of this legislation . At the urging of the Secretary of Agriculture , it was allotted a fairly generous quota , mainly by permitting it to have most of that which can not be filled by the Philippines in the immediate future . But the House Committee on Agriculture has made it clear that Cuba will be expected to reduce its exports of sugar to this country during the next few years and that the subsidized products of this country are not waiving their rights to have their quotas expanded . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most dubious legislative contributions to come out of the present session of Congress .
