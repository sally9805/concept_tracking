txt Eleven inmates of the Illinois State Training School for Boys near St. Charles pried up a pantry window in Cleveland cottage and escaped over a 13 foot , barbed wire topped fence last night . All were from 15 to 17 . There were 38 inmates and a couple serving as substitute house parents in the cottage at the time of the break , about 7:30 p. m . Two of the fugitives were captured within a few minutes , one on the school grounds , the other just outside , and six more were rounded up within two hours near Batavia . Speedy capture of the others was predicted . School officials said that the 38 inmates were reading , playing cards , and entertaining themselves during a recreation period after dinner and that one assigned to clean the pantry had remained there . The others congregated in the pantry with him and apparently forced the window and pried off a screen .
