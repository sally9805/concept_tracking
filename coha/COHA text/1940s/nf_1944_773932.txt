txt // builder-architect of earlier colonial tradition ; though an archi tect who took meticulous pains with his detail and at the beginning of his career was a daring innovator , he nevertheless remained true to the fundamentally British traditions of Pain , Adam , and Chambers . His father had been a builder-architect in New York before the Revolution , and the designer of such handsome churches as the Brick Church and the North Dutch Church ; some of his drawings for them are preserved among the drawings of his son in the New York Historical Society , and show no mean skill in both delineation and design . The father 's churches were among the outstanding examples in America of the polished English Pal ladian Baroque . Basically the son 's churches are examples of the same tradi tion . St. John 's on Varick Street , in which his brother Isaac Mc-Comb collaborated , is in essence merely another , lighter , more delicate , more sophisticated version of St. Paul 's , built fifty years earlier . His alterations of his father 's Brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem to be by the same hand ; even the Bleecker Street Church , built in 1822 , is still well within the Wren-Gibbs tradition . Yet the younger McComb was no mere copyist . Particularly in his early studies for Government House he seems eager to break the four-square tradition of the Colonial manor house , and many of his house studies disclose daring innovations in mass as well as in plan . He studied and restudied , evidently con amore , the ro tunda stairway in the New York city hall , delighted with its new sense of open spaciousness on a geometrical foundation ; his free handling of the curved corner and the slim colonnade of No. 7 State Street shows the same freedom in approach that distinguishes the best work of his Boston contemporaries ? Bulfinch , Banner , Benjamin , and Parris . Still , as with these Boston contemporaries , all of McComb 's // innovations are within the framework of the British tradition . It is characteristic that in his detailing of the New York city hall his chief vade mecum was Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly knew well James Paine 's Plans , Elevations , and Sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen 's Houses ; 2 certainly in Queen 's College , at Rutgers , he returns to the solid massiveness of an earlier time . Only in one work does a markedly different quality appear ? in Washington Hall , at Broadway and Reade Street . Here we have a definite and conscious effort on his part to be completely American . The scheme is a common one , but there is a new and simpler classicism in its pilastered and pedimented front ? it is wide and low , unassuming yet monu-mental , the very opposite of the slimness of No. 7 State Street or Hamilton Grange . Within this classic frame , McComb strives for new and American details , and here the precedent that evidently inspired him was L'Enf ant 's Federal Hall . The same Doric order is used in both ; the same stars decorate the metopes . There is in both a similar search for a new symbolism to express a young nation . And even in the basic elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McComb 's mind when he laid out the pediment carried by four pilasters placed above a simply rusticated basement . ' McComb 's most original work is probably that which is most controlled by utility ? the lighthouses and the fortifications , es-pecially the fort that later became Castle Garden and , later still , the Aquarium . Here , where there was the least chance of imposing the Chambers and Paine details , his natural form sense emerged // triumphant , and the lights at Montauk , Cape Henry , and Eton 's Neck still exist to show the power of that talent . Elsewhere there is little of the revolutionary in his work . Nothing is there to parallel the Latrobe innovations or the radical simplicity of even the earliest work of Robert Mills . He had entered the building world as a bricklayer ; all his life , despite his wide reputation and his brilliance in design , despite the comparative wealth he earned , he remained the builder-architect , seldom the architect as designer alone . And so , with the rapidly changing New York world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the architectural picture , which held fresh colors from a new palette he did not know . . For New York was changing ; then , as now , it was diligently seeking the novel and the fashionable . Its occasional architectural conservatisms are all the more surprising because they are so exceptional . Who , for instance , designed the Quaker meeting house on Stuyvesant Square , which bears the incongruous date of 1860 ? How at that late date did its simple brick walls , its beautiful proportions , and its attenuated Doric porches come to preserve and to express so surely the architectural ideals and forms of the early Federal period , which had elsewhere passed away forty years before ? One would like to know what McComb thought of the new men ? Town and Thompson and Davis ? who were laying out the lines of the new picture . His own later years were devoted to his family and to philanthropy . It is significant that both the John McCombs were pillars of the Gener ; . l Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects chosen to represent the profession as founders of the National Academy of Design were Ithiel Town and Martin Thompson . The most radical prophecy of what was to follow appeared in the competition for the New York city hall in 1802 , and was due largely to the appearance on the scene of a man foreign to the English tradition ? Joseph Francois Mangin , probably a French // refugee from the Revolution , a man of imagination ( perhaps too much imagination , as his plan for a great dock development on the site of the Collect Pond indicates ) and of evident technical ability , an excellent draftsman , engineer , and architect . Mangin and McComb in partnership produced the winning design for the New York city hall , and with this the entire English tradition received its deathblow . None of the English detail that McComb later worked out for it , taken so carefully and modified so skill-fully from the well-known English books of Sir William Chambers and others , as McComb 's notes prove , ' could obscure the fact that here for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not Georgian and not Adam and not Regency . Its use of the orders and their relation to the openings , its sense of scale , and its general placing of detail are if anything more French than English . Yet it is a French style more dainty than that of Louis XIV and more robust than most Louis XVI work . New York 's cosmopolitanism was finding its first expression . Of Mangin 's other works in New York , the Park Theater was much admired for its interior and its plan , although the exterior was never decorated with the original pediment and pilasters Man-gin had planned for it . His state prison , which stood for many years on the banks of the Hudson just north of what is now Chris-topher Street , was restrained , beautiful in detail , and excellently. planned , though its very nature prevented richness of treatment . ' It is noteworthy that Mangin was also responsible , in his design for the old St. Patrick 's on Prince and Mulberry Streets , begun in 1809 , for what was possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had obviously planned a church with twin towers of the Notre Dame variety fronting an interior of really vast scale ; but the towers were completed only a little above the roof and the whole front mishandled by later alterations , so // that old engravings show a strange caricature . The church burned in the sixties and has since been rebuilt , but the lower parts of Mangin 's walls still stand and show the simple window treatment he had designed and his many strange travesties of Gothic form , which in spite of their queerness have an unusual and impressive effect of great scale . The Mangin-Goerck map of New York is an-other evidence of Mangin 's skill as a draftsman , notwithstanding the criticisms of the time regarding its accuracy ; we know too that he was much interested in the problem of the military de fenses of the city and that he was consulted with regard to them , first by Washington , who appointed him one of the engineers in charge , and later by Aaron Burr , to whom he also was apparently well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still a blank page . Another radical development in these early years was the cre ation of a special New York type of dwelling . Montgomery Schuy ler has covered the history of the New York private house with his customary thoroughness in The Architectural Record 7 under the title The Small City House in New York . ' No detailed treat ment therefore is needed here . It is only necessary to point out that the type is a local one , different both from the more ample Boston examples , which often give the impression of being coun try houses modified for a city location , and from the Philadelphia types , which are usually more crowded and in their treatment more severe . This New York type , usually twenty or twenty-five feet wide and but two rooms deep , with the stairs at the side lighted from the rear windows , and with a colonnaded porch in the back yard leading to the privy , was well established by the 1820 's . Two or three stories high , these houses usually had low-pitched roofs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambrel-roof types were frequent . The main floor was raised con siderably above the street level , and the steps leading up to it had delicate iron railings . The door , at one side of the front , was often the only touch of richness to relieve the simplicity of the rest ; al-though the detail of the door treatment changed as fashions // changed , its general composition ? consisting of a rich surround-ing treatment ( if possible , in masonry ) , leaded sidelights ( often very narrow ) , and a leaded fanlight ( either square- or round-headed ) ? remained constant for a long period . The plane of the door with its fan- and sidelights was usually set well back from the front surface to give an interesting depth of shadow . Within , well-designed mantels ( often of marble ) , simple plas-ter cornices , and sometimes richly carved wooden door and window trims gave even to the small houses an effect of luxury . Staircase balusters usually were simply turned and light in scale . One New York characteristic to be found occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the handrail in place of the horizontal spiral sweep usual in England and elsewhere in America . Sometimes , as in the Seabury-Tredwell ( Old Merchant 's ) house , No. 27 East Fourth Street , this vertical scroll was carved with a long and graceful acanthus leaf , very much in the Duncan Phyfe manner . On the main floor the two chief rooms were always connected by a wide door ; from about 1825 on , this opening was a double sliding door , allowing the two rooms to be thrown together en suite . The trim of the sliding door was , next to the mantels , the richest element in the composition . During the 1820 's the custom arose of placing pilasters on either side of the door , carrying a lintel with carved square end blocks and a larger rectangular central block of considerable size ; often there were cap molds over the blocks as well . The leaves carved in the blocks usually were of acanthus type and projected boldly ; they were the last surviving evidences of the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems a pure localism in New York State ; it continued in use well into the thir-ties , when Greek forms were elsewhere dominant . The Greek Revival houses of the 1830 's are developments of this type . The sliding door between front and back rooms becomes merely part of a large , architectonic , columnar screen . Ionic or Corinthian columns , free-standing , are on either side of the door , // and an entablature carries across them from wall to wall . The other doors in the lower rooms , though often enriched with pilas-ters , are kept entirely subsidiary in scale , and the fireplace man-tels ? are usually broad and low . Simple , refined moldings , broad surfaces , and concentrated enrichment in rosettes or bands or carved capitals or central plaster ceiling roses combined with the high ceilings ( 11 to 14 feet high ) and the broad areas of plain // wall to create an effect of serene and elegant clarity , accented by the long hangings at the windows , the classic-patterned carpets , and the broad mahogany surfaces of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent framework either for quiet family living or , when thrown together , for large and formal entertainments . The front room was traditionally the parlor , ' but unlike the best parlor ' of New England farmhouses it was also used as the general family living room . The room below it in the basement was used as a nursery and family workroom ; it might also be used as a breakfast room because of its convenience to the kitchen be-hind . The rear room on the main floor throughout this period of the twenties , thirties , and forties was the main family dining room ; its use as a back parlor ' only came in later . ' ? On the floor immediately above the main floor were usually three or four bedrooms , two of them large ones with ample dress-ing rooms and closet space between , and one or two of them small hall bedrooms . ' Sometimes there were two or even three such floors and at the top of the house an attic floor ( often lighted by dormers ) containing several small servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing , feminine work ' of all kinds , and storage . The whole made an efficient , gracious , and dignified house for family living . Given the first error in New York land planning ? the standardization of the 25-by-100-foot lot , or the 20-by-100- // foot lot ? it is hard to see how the house layout could have been improved , at least for families moderately well off . As time went on , numerous changes were made in the details of this basic scheme . Service stairs behind the main stairs became common . Oval central main stairs lighted by a skylight at the top were often used in the earlier period , as for instance in the large and elegant house at No. 8 Greenwich Street ; and skylighting of a central stair well became nearly universal after 1835 . Bathrooms began to make their appearance in the 1830 's , replacing one or more hall bedrooms , though in the common use of water closets and plumbing generally New York was more backward than Phila-delphia.1 ' But , once bathrooms had been adopted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexity of the installations . Thus R. G. Hatfield 's Parish house ( 1848 ) at Broadway and Seventeenth Street , the plans for which are in the New York Public Library , had seven water closets and eleven tubs // and wash basins , 12 as well as a master 's bathroom in which the fix-tures were used as the foundation of a rich , architectonic , and sur-prisingly modern bathroom . " Naturally there were many exceptional houses both of the row type and the individual free-standing type . Of the row type the two most interesting examples were Colonnade Row , sometimes known as Lafayette Terrace or La Grange Terrace ( of which four houses , much altered , still remain ) , on Lafayette Street , and the earlier London Terrace on West Twenty-third Street ( de-stroyed some years ago ) . Both were attempts to create a rich architectural composition with a series of connected houses ; Seth Geer was the builder responsible for them . The designer of Colon-nade Row was A. J. Davis ; he also evidently had something to do ? just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mod-est project as well . In Colonnade Row ( 1836 ) a continuous colonnade of Greek Corinthian columns , beautifully executed , ran the whole length of the group above a simple rusticated ground floor . The entrances , raised but little above the ground level , were decorated with Greek Doric columns , and on the projecting cheeks of the steps in front stood slim and elegant cast-iron candelabrum-type lamp posts . " The row is built of Westchester marble , and the detail is well placed and unusually perfect in conception and elevation . Colon-nade Row was New York 's most extravagant as well as most origi-nal attempt to build dignified , gracious , and elegant houses for wealthy tenants , and it achieved instantaneous fame . Yet Davis 's wishes for it were even more original ; in the Davis collection at the Avery Library is a drawing , labeled Approaching what Lafay-ette Terrace ought to be , ' which shows the houses crowned by inter-esting vine-grown pergolas and roof gardens . London Terrace , designed four years earlier ( 1832 ) , was sim-pler and more unassuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // houses was decorated somewhat monotonously with a continuous parade of Greek antae in lieu of pilasters . The scheme may have been borrowed from an earlier pilaster-decorated row that once stood on Charlton Street and antedated the Greek Revival move ment . It had Doric pilasters of brick above an arcaded basement , and simple detail of the Late Colonial or Federal type . Another interesting row or terrace ' was De Pauw Row on Bleecker Street , probably the work of Samuel Dunbar . This was a group of unusually large houses extending a whole block on the site of the present Mills Hotel . Like some of the rows in London , it obtained its effect by treating the whole as a composition with central and end pavilions . One of the doorways still serves as the entrance to a restaurant in the next block east . Other important rows existed on Bleecker Street ; one of these , Le Roy Place ( 1827 ) , consisted of two rows of stone houses across the street from each other , extending from Mercer to Greene Street . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more lots . Some of those on Washington Square were of this type , as was the Edwin Forrest house on West Twenty-second Street . There were occasionally free-standing houses in the city too . Two of the finest were the Brevoort ( De Rham ) house once on the northwest corner of Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue ? four-square , dignified , quite different in its paneled front and project ing porch from most New York houses ? and the largest of them all , the Stevens palace ' on Murray Street . Both have been at tributed to Davis . The Stevens palace was certainly by him , and many of his drawings for it exist . Its plan , with a great central hall , is monumental to the highest degree and shows that interest in geometrical shape relationships which was such a marked feature of Davis 's design . An interior ? clear and spacious and refined ? preserved for us in a superb colored rendering by Davis in the New York Historical Society , has been thought to represent rooms in the Stevens palace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that building , this drawing almost certainly is of a quite differ ent residence . Occasionally buildings with the characteristics of other locali132 GREEK REVIVAL ARCHITECTURE ties are found . Such are the bow-fronted houses on the north side of Sixteenth Street and on Union Square , both built about 1836-7 . In these the expression has the qualities of Boston work ; in scale , in basic form , even in detail they look more like the work of Parris , perhaps , than of the New York builders . By the late thirties New York had already begun to be the foremost American city in adopting new fashions , in architecture as in other things . A. J. Davis was himself a great innovator , end lessly seeking modifications of characteristic types and current styles . He claimed to be the first designer who rebelled against the ordinary high stoop ' and substituted grade entrances , thus de veloping the typical American basement ' type of house . He de-signed famous Gothic city houses , like the Waddell villa and the House of Mansions . ' And others too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing Gothic variations of the typical New York house . In the forties as well came the great influx of Italianesque in fluence ; together with the gradually increasing popularity of Con necticut brownstone it revolutionized the appearance of the new streets . Marble also came into increasing use ; the Marble House , ' still standing on the southwest corner of Eighth Street and Fifth Avenue and dating from about 1847 , is characteristic . The earliest of these houses carry over some of the simplicity and great scale of the Greek Revival , and the detail is restrained and well exe cuted . The Belmont houses once on lower Fifth Avenue , designed by Frederick Diaper , an English architect , showed the quiet and gracious dignity of which this typically New York type of Ital ian ' was capable . In 1848 Detlef Lienau , a German-born architect trained in Germany and Paris ( where he had worked under Labrouste ) , ar rived in New York and almost at once entered upon a large and wealthy practice . With his work the age of eclecticism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1850 and his Schermerhorn houses on West Twenty-third Street in the follow ing years were superb examples of French nineteenth-century de-sign , rather neo-Grec in their refinement and originality . But in // plan as in detail they were no longer examples of the New York tradition . They were beautiful and sumptuous houses , but they were in essence imports . An interesting element in the later New York houses is the cast-iron balcony or porch , with its lacy and slim supports , its scrolled and open brackets , its curved roof . There are still many examples left , though their number is rapidly diminishing ; one of the finest is that of the late Greek Revival Harper house on the west side of Gramercy Park . The history of these balconies is obscure ? where they were first used , or who first realized the loveliness of the contrast between their intricate lines and the sim ple brick surfaces behind them . They are rare before 1840 ; then they suddenly become common all over the central and southern states . They are to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached their greatest development in Charles-ton , Savannah , Mobile , and especially New Orleans . It is perhaps significant that many New Orleans examples were cast there from patterns brought from the North , and that their sudden popu larity coincides with a period of great northern commercial pene tration of the southern states . Could the New York architects have set the original fashion ? The designers of most of the New York Greek Revival houses are unknown . It is manifest that there was in the city a large num ber of thoroughly trained and even brilliant designers and crafts-men ; but the professional architect , as distinguished from the builder and contractor , had as yet hardly emerged . " Even in the early thirties we know that the architects then in New York usually worked with the contractors and builders rather than with the owner , and that contractors bought plans from the architects and // draftsmen . Interesting evidence of the skill of these architect-draftsmen is to be found in a set of drawings , now in the Avery Library , Columbia University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an architect named James O'Donnell , who was later the architect of Notre Dame church ( 1824 ) in Montreal . His Columbia drawings for work partly executed are meticulous and far in advance of those for the original King 's College fifty years earlier , or even of the existing drawings of Asher Benjamin . Other drawings from an even earlier period now in the McComb collection at the New York Historical Society , and bearing other names than McComb 's , reveal a similarly advanced technical skill ; it is to men such as these that we evidently owe the polish and ur-banity of the earlier New York house work.1e // Two men stand out from this general mass : Josiah Brady and Martin Thompson . Of Brady 's work we know little save the naive but much admired Gothic of the second Trinity , the later and more ambitious Gothic of St. Thomas 's Church , and the dignified Greek Revival of the Anderson house at Throg 's Neck ; but we do know that he was a master of Alexander Jackson Davis and is referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York ' at the time . This undoubtedly means that he was the only man who was an architect and not a builder as well . He was also the architect of the Second Congregational Church ( 1826 ) at Prince and Mercer Streets , which is interesting for having a porch of heavy , unfluted Greek Doric columns with end piers decorated with round-headed niches . This combination of Greek and Roman forms was undoubt edly a conscious one , expressive of the non-archaeological char acter so common in American Greek Revival work . The spirit is not unlike that in much work of Haviland 's . Martin Thompson was a man of a different type , artistically advanced and a magnificent designer but professionally conserva tive ? a man who , although like McComb he used the term archi tect , never entirely released himself from the earlier system of the architect-contractor . His first important work was the building for the Bank of the United States on Wall Street , later the home of the United States Assay Office ; its front still stands , re-erected , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum // of Art . This building , commissioned as early as 1822 , is a polished and knowing piece of dignified classic work , well detailed and beau tifully executed . In the breadth of its proportions it shows that freedom from rigidly conventional classic proportions ? a qual ity that may have been the result of ignorance but is often the cause of great and characteristic charm ? which is frequently typical of American Classic Revival work . His second important work was even more distinguished : the second Merchants ' Ex-change , burned in the great fire of 1835 . This lavish building , with its lovely curve-ended exchange room , its powerful scale com bined with delicate detail , was during its brief life one of the most beautiful public buildings in America . Drawings by Thomp son for the Columbia Grammar School in 1829 show a monumen tal building of scholarly Greek Revival type ; and an elevation for the houses that were to be erected on Columbia College property on Murray and Chapel streets ? all who built on these lots had to agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the advent of Greek detail into New York house de-sign . It is so similar to much of the work built later in Greenwich Village that the conclusion seems probable that Thompson was one of those most often called on by builders for designs . He was probably also the architect of the typical elevation and many of the houses built on the Sailors ' Snug Harbor property in Wash ington Square North . These are so much like the Columbia Col lege drawings as to make that attribution probably correct . In addition , according to family tradition , Martin Thompson was the architect for Sailors ' Snug Harbor on Staten Island ( the builder of which was Samuel Thomson ) and is credited in an obitu ary in The American Architect 18 with the earlier work on Sing Sing prison and with the New York State Arsenal in Central Park , now the Park Department offices . Little is known about his later career . He was evidently a man of some importance , for he was Street Commissioner for a great number of years . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifties and // sixties , for which he was paid by the city , are testimony that he still stood high in public esteem . Later he seems to have retired altogether from the practice of architecture ; he died in 1877 in Glen Cove . Thompson brings us into the new architectural age , for when Ithiel Town established a New York practice in 1826 he took Thompson into partnership.19 The exact relationship between them is difficult to classify . Such work as the steeple for St. Mark 's in-the-Bouwerie , so unconventional in its simplicity of line , and the famous Canal Street Greek Doric church , which Lafever re ferred to in 1829 as the finest piece of Greek work in New York , were done under the name of Town and Thompson ; yet local New York accounts give all the credit to Thompson . Something similar happens in the case of Town 's later partners , Davis and Dakin , but it would be foolish to underestimate the importance of Town 's influence and personality . Trained thoroughly in the builder-architect tradition of New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston ? and responsible for the remarkable early Gothic Trinity Church in New Haven , Town won national fame as the inventor of the Town truss for bridges ; and not only fame , for the common use of this type of truss ( many of the covered bridges still standing are examples ) brought him a large fortune as well . It is his handling of this wealth that reveals the unusual character of the man , for he spent it lavishly on travel , study , and the acquisition of what was undoubtedly by far the largest and finest library of architectural and art books and en gravings in the country at the time . One gets echoes of the renown of this collection from many sources over many years . Much of his library at this time was kept in New York and made virtually a public library . The Picture of New York , " published by Good-rich in 1828 , speaks of the architectural rooms ' of Town , Thom GREEK REVIVAL ARCHITECTURE son , and Davis , where anyone who was interested could consult Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection was brought together in New Haven , in Town 's house , which had been specifically designed to receive it.21 The famous Mrs. Lydia Sigourney describes the house and library at great length in an article 22 published in The Ladies ' Companion in 1839 . After Town 's death his books and prints were sold in a series of auctions , printed catalogues of which exist ; yet the number of books in these catalogues is far below the number we know he owned , and what happened to the rest of them is still a fascinating subject for con jecture . Town was evidently a man of powerful personality , a great job getter , but also a scholar and an idealist . He was one of the found ers of the National Academy of Design . He evidently dreamed of an American architecture and an American art , independent and standing on their own feet , and through his magnificent collection of books wished to open to American architects all of the stores of European knowledge , so that with a real solidity of foundation they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how important he was as a designer it is almost im possible to discover . Certainly both with Thompson and with his more famous partner , Alexander Jackson Davis , the greater amount of the actual drafting and detailed study of the problems was left to his partners . It is probably also true that the design was chiefly theirs too . Town seems to have realized and accepted his real part in the great Classic Revival movement in America ? that of being an inspiration , a counselor , a sort of public-relations counsel , and also ( because of the wealth that had come to him from his bridges ) a magnificent patron as well . In all the complicated accounts of the partnership of Town and Davis that still exist , although there are many evidences of occasional friction there is never a sign of artistic jealousy on the part of either . The frictions seem entirely financial or personal , and this in spite of the fact that local papers tended everywhere // to give credit to the local member of the firm . Fortunately a tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail is available and through it one can get a lively picture of the gradual development of a strong architectural profession . In the early years ? Davis was taken into partnership in 1829 ? the accounts are extremely mixed . Already well known as a draftsman , Davis continued to work for many clients in a sketchy way ? apparently selling designs and drawings to builders as well as to individuals ? and continued for some time to make those vivid and meticulous sketches of American towns and American buildings which were the basis for so many of the beautiful engravings by which the America of that time is known . At times Davis was even working for other architects , whether as a designer or merely as a delineator it is impossible to say . Thus there is evidence that he made drawings for both Brady and Thompson while at the same time he was a partner of Town . Notwithstanding this confusion it is typical of these newer professional architects that Alexander Jackson Davis made his approach to architecture first through the medium of sketches of landscapes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accurate delineations of buildings he made for lithographers and engravers before he was noted as an architect , and he first appears in the directory as an architectural composer . ' He served some sort of architectural apprenticeship with Josiah Brady , but his education did not end there , and he made an extended visit to Boston in 1827 . In Boston ? and this , too , is characteristic of the newer era ? he was introduced into the very heart of the intellectual circles . Through his friend Dr. Sargent he was given the run of the Athenaeum . Intellectual Boston was then in the forefront of the new classical movement ; at the Athenaeum or in the homes of his Boston acquaintances he must have been immersed in that fruitful and exciting atmosphere which was to stimulate such important literary growth later on . A natural talent for drawing , a year of exposure to the intellectual ferment of Boston classicism ? what more stimulating preparation for a young architect could there have been ? And a practice of architecture growing from such // seeds was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one that grew out of any mere practice of the building trades , however diligent and skillful . Later , in New York , the Town and Davis firm held a similar social position . They were accepted members of the cultural aris tocracy ; they frequented that society of which Dr. Hosack was perhaps the leading light ? a society as cultivated as , and more cosmopolitan than , the more brilliant Boston circles . The architectural rooms ' of Town , Davis , and Thompson symbolized , as they forwarded , the first acceptance in New York of ' ie architect primarily as an artist and professional man , on a level with the members of the other professions , and not merely as a sort of superior tradesman . The whole picture one gathers of architecture in the late twen ties and early thirties reveals a situation chaotic but violently alive . Outside of the work of John McComb , Jr. , which was rap-idly diminishing in amount as he withdrew from active practice , New York had ? as Boston had at about the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thompson , Davis , Lafever , Dunbar , Pollard , and others whose names we do not know . James Gallier has left a vivid impression of the archi tectural world of New York in his little-known Autobiography , " where he writes as follows : On my arrival in New York on the 14th of April , 1832 , I consid ered a large city as the most likely place to expect employment in my profession , but here I found that the majority of people could with difficulty be made to understand what was meant by a profes sional architect ; the builders , that is , the carpenters and bricklayers , all called themselves architects , and were at that time the persons to whom owners of property applied when they required plans for build ing ; the builder hired some poor draftsman , of whom there were some half a dozen in New York at that time , to make the plans , paying him a mere trifle for his services . The drawings so made were , it is true , but of little value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they wanted a house built , they looked about for one already finished , which they thought suitable for their purpose ; and then bargained with a builder to erect for them such another , or // one with such alterations upon the model as they might point out . All this was soon changed , however , and architects began to be em ployed by proprietors before going to the builders ; and in this way , in a short time , the style of buildings public and private showed signs of rapid improvement . There was at that time , properly speaking , only one architect 's office in New York , kept by Town and Davis . Town had been a car penter , but was no draftsman ; he had obtained a patent on a wooden bridge , the right to erect which he sold to several parties in the States , and had made some money by it ; he had been once or twice to London , and bought there a huge collection of books in various languages upon the arts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Davis , his partner , was no mechanic , but a good draftsman , and pos sessed much taste as an artist . . . Gallier goes on to mention the Dakins ? James H. , a student and partner of Town , who was later to join Gallier in New Orleans , and Charles , his brother , who accompanied Gallier to the South ? and Minard Lafever , with whom he had an ill-fated and disastrous partnership for a year . It is an interesting fact also that the ac-counts of Town , Davis , and Dakin report the payment of one hun dred and seventy-five dollars to Gallier for drawings ; it was prob ably during the making of these that Gallier became acquainted with Dakin . " Trained in the more advanced architectural world of England as Gallier was , this confused professional situation in New York was little to his liking and , disgusted , he left ? to found a fortune in New Orleans and become one of its two or three most popular and skillful architects.25 Yet this New York condition apparently had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years was extraordinarily rapid and the amount of building required was far in excess of what could have been built in a normal architec tural way . The builders , however , could call upon this small group of architects , all of them men of talent and skill , for their plans ; the builders themselves had standards of execution and a general // knowledge of architectural detail , left over from earlier contractor-architect days , which enabled them to interpret these plans and designs sympathetically . The results are the charming streets of Greenwich Village and parts of the Lower East Side , bordered by houses that are simple and harmonious in exterior proportions , with rooms beautiful in their relationships , with detail ? usually in the newly fashionable Greek manner ? of refinement and dig-nity , and with doors as beautiful in detail as they are excellent in general conception . Alone the builders could not have produced this , and working alone the few architects themselves could not have spread over the city such a large amount of satisfactory work . The Old Merchant 's Seabury-Tredwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical example , fortunately preserved through continuous ownership in one family for over a hundred years ; restored as a museum today , it illustrates how harmoniously the simple mahogany surfaces and the rather heavy carving of so-called American Empire furniture , relieved here and there by the lighter pieces of Duncan Phyfe or his followers , resting on rich French carpets , fitted into those tall and ample rooms . It is char-acteristic of this house also that many of its details are similar to those shown in the Lafever books.26 Thus the front door has resemblances to Plate 42 of The Young Builder 's General Instruc-tor , the colonnaded opening between front and back parlors is like Plate 60 of The Modern Builders ' Guide , the plaster rose resem-bles Plate 21 of The Beauties of Modern Architecture , and the plaster cornice ornament in the parlor is obviously based on Plate 64 of The Young Builder 's General Instructor . The house shows too , in the exquisiteness of its carving ( the main floor newel with its sweeping acanthus scroll at the bottom of the handrail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior railings , the high standards of workmanship then current ; but it also shows , in a certain naive quality and occasional confusion of form ( such as the extra band of carving over the architrave of the parlor screen ) , the fact that no one designer who knew his detail as did the architects already mentioned could have been responsible for the execuCLASSIC // tion of the work . The larger houses ? such as the best of those on the north side of Washington Square , the Rhinelander house at No. 1 Fifth Avenue , the Perry house by James Dakin in Brooklyn , and others ? were indubitably the results of the complete architectural services of their respective architects ; this was doubtless true also of the churches and public buildings that were erected . But , taken by and large , the greater part of the domestic work of the period was done according to the other system , and we can only wonder that under those conditions its level should have been so extraordinarily high . As the thirties wore on , this method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect appears to all intents and purposes to have become the modern professional architect , working on a fee basis for individual clients , not only designing but also overseeing contracts and detail and superintending the construction . As this development proceeded , the method of payment necessarily began to change . In the earlier system , payment seems to have been largely arranged at so much a drawing , and Davis at least continued this practice in billing individual clients for whom he was furnishing full services . Typical prices quoted are : // These prices should be multiplied by from three to five , to give their counterparts today . The same development toward professional autonomy also brought two more modern elements into the picture : the student draftsman and the large architectural office . In an era when archi-tectural schools as we know them today did not yet exist , " the only method of entry into the profession was through the office of either an architect or a builder . Town and Davis made a special point of having student draftsmen who paid them various amounts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings coming from the Davis office ( drawings of Greek temple plans , or orders , or the like ) are undoubtedly the work of such students . But an office doing the work they did required much more than student draftsmen , and the trained draftsman working on a salary became an essential element in the scheme . Unfortunately no complete list of the Town-Davis draftsmen exists , although occasional names can be picked out . Such for instance was James H. Dakin , who was first a draftsman , for a time a partner , and later left to join Gallier in New Orleans ; also there were John Stirewalt of North Carolina , Robert Seaton of New Orleans , Richard Lathers of Georgetown ( Washington ) , J. A. Suydam , William Harrison , and J. C. Cady , later a partner in the once well-known firm of Cady , Berg &; See . // The pay of these men was sometimes quite high . Gallier mentions wages up to seven dollars a day , which would be the equivalent today of approximately one hundred and fifty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the power and prestige of other architects like Upjohn and Renwick , who were chiefly associated with the Gothic Revival , the launching of the architectural profession was well-nigh complete ; as far as its functions went , the architectural office of those days was doing almost the same work as the architectural office of today . Payment was usually on a percentage basis , most frequently five or six per cent ; but in connection with this it must be remembered that the difficulties and complications of modern structural systems and modern mechanical equipment scarcely existed as yet . The decade of the thirties was essentially the era of the triumph of the Greek Revival in New York . Greek detail began to appear spasmodically in the late twenties , although it had been influencing work in Washington and Baltimore almost from the break of the century , and although even in staid Boston ? in occasional work as early as 1818 ? the Greek inspiration is apparent . The reason for this late date for the New York Greek Revival is possibly to be sought in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McComb , Jr . The work of Mangin and the fact that New York had a strong body of French settlers also played a part . The birth of the Greek Revival in New York corresponds surprisingly closely with the time of Town 's arrival here ; in fact Davis credits Town with building the first Greek doorway in New York . Here the influence of Town 's magnificent library can be read . The architectural rooms of Town , Davis , and Thompson at the Exchange became a center for the artistic elite of New York . Town and Thompson , both founders of the National Academy of Design ( Town in the First Fifteen ' and Thompson in the Second Fifteen ' ) , together with Davis , who was influential in that other great institution , the American Institute of Arts , had the closest possible contact with many of the // important artists of the America of their day , and furthermore all three had wide acquaintance throughout New York society . This combination of magnificent library , three men of great origi-nality and talent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York could not but have a great effect ; though New York was one of the last of the cities to take up the Greek Revival , it rapidly became the city in which Greek forms enjoyed the widest repute and were most brilliantly and lavishly used . Minard Lafever ( 1797 ? 1854 ) belonged to a different world from that frequented by Town and Davis , but his influence also was deep and wide . Trained as a carpenter iii the Finger Lakes region of New York , to which his family had moved in his early childhood from his birthplace near Morristown , he was entirely self-taught architecturally . He preserved all his life something of the common-sense practicality of his early training , and during at least the early part of his practice in New York ( where he ar-rived in 1828 ) he worked as a draftsman for builders . It was hard and not particularly rewarding work , as the Gallier quotation 28 shows , and apparently it prevented Lafever from emerging as a full-fledged professional architect until the forties . Davis never mentions him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous influence in the New York of that time . It is by his first three books that his Greek Revival work must be judged : The Young Builder 's General Instructor ( 1829 ) , The Modern Build-ers ' Guide ( 1833 ) , and The Beauties of Modern Architecture ( 1835 ) . His artistic progress from the crudity of the first to the polished restraint of the last is amazing in so brief a period ; it shows Lafever to have been not only an omnivorous reader but a designer of unusual and continually growing aesthetic sensitive-ness . All the books are simple and unassuming . All bear witness to their author 's carpenter training and his eagerness to help those who like himself entered architecture through the building trades . Yet all the books show a driving , imaginative , creative force that expresses itself with clear and lovely restraint . The second and third contain probably the most exquisite and the least archaeoCLASSIC // logical of all American Greek Revival detail ? personal , inven tive , restrained . " As a pure creator of beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at his time unrivaled . The exquisite character of the plates in his book , their bold modifications of Greek precedent , their controlling sense of artistic restraint and propriety , their sure spotting of ornament ? especially the ro settes he loved so much ? not only go to show what freedom is included in the term Greek Revival ' but also reveal Lafever as perhaps the greatest designer of architectural decoration of his time in America . The broad acceptance of his leadership over large parts of America bears witness as well to the general high level of popular taste . To him more than to any other one man is due the clear , inviting quality of the interiors of Greek Revival houses and the crisp , imaginative character of the wood and plas ter detail that so frequently accents and beautifies them . Nevertheless , of Lafever 's Greek work in New York almost nothing is known . The old St. James 's Church on James Street near Chatham Square is probably by him ; its gallery front design appears in The Beauties of Modern Architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lintel cornice is purely in his style . But , although we know little definite Greek Revival work by him , his touch can be read in door and mantel and interior details in many houses all over the city , and his influence spread far beyond . Lafever was to earn a great fame in Brooklyn later with a series of superb Gothic Revival churches , of which Holy Trinity ( 1844 ? 7 ) is the largest and most famous , the Church of the Sav iour near by ( 1844 ) the most refined and exquisite . Packer Colle giate Institute with its rather prim , simple English Gothic is his too , as are the stone tunnel and steps at the river end of Montague Street ? a monument of true Greek simplicity . The Reformed Church of the Heights ( 1851 ) and the old Brooklyn Savings Bank ( 1847 ) , both recently destroyed , showed his brilliant use of the later eclectic classic forms that began to come in in the // forties ; much of this work he included in his last great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York by G. P. Putnam in 1857 . His Brooklyn fame was chiefly as a Gothicist , but his influence outside the city was almost entirely Greek and came from the wide distribution of his books , particularly in the West and the South . So to the man of Brooklyn Lafever ' meant Gothic , but at the very same moment to the man of Ohio or New Orleans Lafever ' meant Greek . In New York houses the general plan and proportions were so fixed by the satisfactory traditional norm that the Greek inspira-tion could only be used in details ? how exquisitely may be seen in the beautiful and restrained plates of the Lafever books . It is the free application of the Greek inspiration to forms and mate-rials essentially new and different that gives this style in New York houses its peculiar vitality . To men like Dunbar and Lafever , and to Davis in his earlier house work , the Greek forms were not divine revelations to be copied unthinkingly ; they were , rather , a new alphabet of grace , restraint , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed . Simple surfaces replaced the fussy small-scale moldings of the earlier wooden door and window trim ; anthemia , Greek volutes , and especially rosettes were used in new and lovely ways of which the Greeks had never dreamed . Some of the Davis houses for Ravenswood in Astoria show the same freedom in basic design that Laf ever showed in detail ; they reveal , too , that Davis was already experimenting with the vivid and imaginative spatial areas which in plan set off so many of his houses from the usual works of the time . In business buildings , as in residences , the Greek Revival brought with it new forms , to give harmony and a new kind of gra-ciousness to large areas of lower New York . The tremendous growth of New York commerce created an overwhelming need for warehouses , factories , offices , and banks ; in the decade of the thir-ties Water , Front , Pearl , and Gold streets were rapidly filling with dignified buildings to take care of the increased trade , just as Wall Street was changing as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character ? were one by one replaced by new buildings with monumental , official-looking , colonnaded fronts . The first of these was Martin Thompson 's Phenix Bank ( 1825 ) ; a decade later others by Isaiah Rogers added to the new monumentality of Wall Street . To this movement that little by little was making over the appearance of lower Manhattan the great fire of 1835 gave an enormous impetus . It destroyed practically every structure between Broad Street , Wall Street , and the East River . In the burned regions whole streets of new buildings rose with surprising rapidity , and it is in these ? and in similar structures contemporary with them elsewhere ? that the new type of building can best be seen . Its essentials were : a ground floor supported on monolithic granite piers , often with Greek anta capitals and carrying a simply molded granite architrave ; above this three or four stories of brick or granite wall , pierced with well-proportioned windows , regularly spaced and often furnished with iron shutters ; then , as a crown to the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moldings of Greek profile . Occasionally an attic story is found under the cornice , with oval windows surrounded by wreaths to form a frieze or rectangular windows with decorative iron grilles . A surprising number of such buildings are still standing , still being used for their original purpose ; the uniformity of their cornice lines , the monumental repetition of their granite piers , and the rhythmical regularity of their openings give a pleasant harmony and unity to the streets they border . The best of these buildings are simple , useful , unostentatious , human in scale , and restrained and delicate in detail . This type of building was not originated after the great fire ; it had begun to come into use at the very beginning of the decade . As with so many other innovations of the time , Davis in his notes claims that Town created the first such structure ? the first store with granite piers ? in the Tappan Store on Wall Street in 1831 . In Boston , as we have seen , granite had been in common use much earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boston in 1827 ? 8 as well as Town 's earlier residence there may have // had an influence in their introducing the new , powerful Massachu-setts material to New York . A drawing of the elevation of the Tappan Store still exists ; in proportion and treatment it is obviously the prototype of an enor-mous amount of early New York work as well as of many similar buildings in the Ohio River towns . There still stand at the east end of Fulton Street a large block of such warehouses and , near by in Water Street , a granite-fronted building , which , though larger in size and more richly detailed , is so similar in spirit and proportion to the Tappan Store ? so sure in its design and with such exqui-site refinement in its moldings and restrained ornament ? that an attribution to Town and Davis themselves seems to be indicated . This general type was susceptible of many variations without having its essential dignity and usefulness destroyed . In the work executed after the fire , brick instead of stone was usually used for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the latter part of the decade cast iron was substituted for granite for the lintels and in exceptional cases for the piers as well . The large building or group of uniform buildings that Pierre Lorillard erected on Gold Street at the head of Webb Street in 1837 is typi-cal ; its tall entrance motif crowned by a pediment that looks down Webb Street is a pleasant accent in the street picture , and its win-dow widths , its slim , decorated lintels , and its tall proportions are those which cast iron alone made possible . Over the two-story cast-iron piers are the three sardonic , impish faces put there to celebrate Lorillard 's victory over those who felt that Webb Street should have been continued on west , over the Lorillard property . Farther down on Gold Street , at the northeast corner of its inter-section with Ferry Street , Lorillard put up another large build-ing , and his unknown architect used there the same details he had in the other structure , varying them in this case by giving the building a rounded corner . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects that within the general frame of a single building scheme , and with the use of detail of generally Greek type , two such important innovations as these could have been made ; for these buildings show what must be one of the very // earliest large-scale uses of cast iron as a structural material , and one of the first uses of the rounded corner at a street intersection . Yet the full sweep of Greek Revival taste could only reveal itself effectively in churches and public buildings . Before the great fire in 1835 Martin Thompson 's Bank of the United States , later the Assay Office , and his second Merchants ' Exchange , one of the most distinguished buildings of the period ( in which he succeeded in blending the new classicism with a cupola of the earlier tradition in a remarkably successful way ) , had already joined with the city hall of Mangin and McComb in giving New York great distinction in its public buildings . Josiah Brady 's St. Thomas 's Church was an early and rather crude attempt at Gothic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . Town and Thompson 's Ascension Church ( 1827 ? 9 ) on Canal Street was already in the full vein of the Greek Revival , with its six-column Theseum-type portico ; Davis 's smaller but more delicate church ( 1831 ) on Bleecker Street was in the same Greek spirit . The Greenwich Presbyterian Church on West Thirteenth Street , probably by Samuel Dunbar , is the only example of this full temple type still standing in New York . Especially important in their broad influence were two churches by Town and Davis : the Carmine Street Church with its recessed porch and two Greek Doric columns in antis ( a front much copied , so that it became almost a standard church facade , with recessed porch between two solid enclosed areas for stairs and storage and with coupled antae on each side , thus creating a five-part composition ) ; and the exquisite Eglise du Saint Esprit ( 1832 ? 4 ) , the French Protestant church , with an Ionic portico of great beauty and a high dome . The Reformed Dutch Church was by Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek temple , by Samuel Dunbar . A number of Greek Revival churches , for the most part greatly altered , remain scattered through the older parts of the city . Several new and monumental theaters also showed the growing popularity of the Greek forms . One of Ithiel Town 's first New York jobs was the Bowery Theater ( 1825 ) , with a large Greek // Doric portico later preserved in the second Bowery Theater built by J. Sera on the same site after the fire . The National Theater ( 1833 ) , with an interesting facade of Greek antae , a well-handled sloping blocking course , and well-proportioned openings , was possibly by Calvin Pollard ; he was at least the architect for its re-construction after a fire in 1840.3 ? Hone remarks in his Diary 31 on the lavish beauty of the new interior . After the great fire New York architects could no longer fill the need for new buildings . Isaiah Rogers ( 1800-1869 ) , who had made his fame as the architect of the Tremont House in Boston , was invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1832-6 ) , where the ideas of mechanical equipment , lux-urious interior design , architectural skill in planning , and digni-fied and monumental exterior design that had characterized the earlier Boston hotel were carried to an even greater extreme . Plumbing , which had been confined to the first floor and basement in the Tremont House , was at last carried here through all the stories , each having its own bath and toilet rooms fed from a roof tank to which water was raised by a steam pump . All of this caused a sensation in its day ; the Astor House was a great advance over even the luxuries of the famous City Hotel designed by McComb . The whole conception was as different from that as its severe and magnificent granite facade differed from the delicate Adam de-tail of the earlier structure . A new type of building almost twen-tieth-century in conception was being born , and the Greek Revival was one of the chief liberating forces which made these new ideas possible . Rogers spent fifteen profitable years in New York . His next great work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second building , but much larger , set again a new standard in taste and accomplishment . Nowhere in the country save possibly in Mills 's Treasury building in Washington had such a monumental structure been so grandly conceived , so simply and directly planned , and so beautifully detailed . Its great Ionic colonnade ? // superb in scale , with granite columns from the Quincy quarries of his friend Solomon Willard ? and its impressive recessed porch still exist as the lower portion of the National City Bank , and have a power expressed in but few buildings in the neighborhood . Built with an exterior of granite throughout and made fireproof by the use of vaulting for its floor construction , the Merchants ' Exchange had as its interior climax a great rotunda , eighty feet in diameter , with a caissoned brick dome . This rotunda was as grand and simple in design as it was great in dimensions . Four recesses opened from it , each with two Corinthian columns in antis . The walls between were quietly paneled in single big rectangles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the columns at each floor level . Such a conception as this shows what a small part the copying of Greek work played in the great architectural triumphs of that period . The Greek Ionic order was used on the exterior , but the Corinthian within was a freshly designed Corinthian , neither Greek nor Roman . In scale , monumentality , and direct simplicity of plan the inspiration was more Roman than Greek , yet the whole was welded inextricably into one powerful organic conception that shows Rogers as a great architect in the fullest sense of the word . Of his other New York work the Middle Dutch Church on Lafayette Place was perhaps the best . Again the power of the large scale he loved and his skill in combining traditional conceptions with a fresh point of view were both present . Particularly impressive was the bold and buttresslike projection of the antae along the sides in contrast with the delicate acroteria . St. Peter 's Roman Catholic Church on Barclay Street has also been attributed to Rogers by Montgomery Schuyler 32 on the grounds of its great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers , at least it shows the same urge toward large conceptions that was his most marked attribute . His design for the Astor Place Opera House was less dis154 GREEK REVIVAL ARCHITECTURE tinguished , for he was hampered by smallness both of site and of appropriation , yet even here he succeeded in giving to the design a simple and powerful composition that had not only classic dig-nity but also an imaginative handling of mass not often associated with Greek Revival work . Almost across the street from Rogers 's Merchants ' Exchange stood the New York customs house , completed in the year Rogers 's building was begun . This interesting structure , now the Sub-Treas-ury , is obviously the result of several minds . A competition for it was won by Town and Davis with a design basically similar in plan conception and identical in exterior treatment with the executed building , except for the fact that above the Greek temple roof Town and Davis had planned a low exposed dome over the central ro-tunda . The colonnade , the high steps , the membering of the flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present building ? are defi-nitely theirs . The interior treatment just as definitely is not . The Commissioners in charge of the work were perhaps rightly fright-ened at the lightness of the construction indicated on the Town and Davis plan , and they employed William Ross , an English archi-tect visiting in New York , to restudy the interior . According to Ross 's own story , published in a letter to Loudon 's The Archi-tectural Magazine , S ' and from the plans he published in this article , the basic ideas of the executed design seem to be his . But before con-struction was started one of America 's early and brilliant sculptors , who had been from time to time also an architect , stone-cutter , and contractor ? John Frazee ? was employed by the Commission-ers as architect for the building , and all the detailing and probably the working drawings were his.S4 The result was bound to be a conception lacking in unity . The exterior is one thing and the interior another , yet both in their way are superb . The most interesting thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frazee 's beautiful exeCLASSIC // cution of it.35 Like the greater number of the public buildings erected at the time , it was fireproof and vaulted in masonry ? the office portions largely in simple groins supported at their intersec-tions by strong columns , the central area by a dome concealed under // the gabled roof . All of the construction is honest , exposed to view , and made an essential part of the architectural effect . Particularly impressive is the shallow cut-granite ring vault with penetrations under the rotunda supported on squat Doric columns ; on its span of perhaps fifty or sixty feet it has a rise of about ten feet . The im-pression of power and dignity that this basement rotunda conveys even today is difficult to describe . Again the Greek Revival elements throughout this interior are completely subsidiary to basic struc-tural and spatial ideals . Other public buildings in New York and its environs ? such as the Brooklyn city hall , by an architect named King , the Staten Island courthouse , and so on ? followed rapidly until the classic tradition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power through the eclectic period almost to our own day , while Greek Revival forms lingered on in minor de-tails long after the style had otherwise passed away . It was so in the work of the Supervising Architect 's office in Washington ; it was so almost everywhere in the country . The Odd Fellows ' Hall on Center and Grand streets still stands to show the coarsened detail but nevertheless the compositional grandeur of the later transi-tional buildings ; it dates from the late forties and , although with its grotesque added stories and its excrescences of signs and fire es-capes it is but a caricature of its former self , some of its impressive-ness of scale is still evident and old engravings allow one in imagi-nation to reconstruct its earlier monumentality . Even the domed Brooklyn Hall of Records some twenty years later , when architecture was beginning to feel the blight of the post-Civil War de-bauch , still preserves in many elements of its interior detail linger-ing hints of the delicacy and the imagination of the then almost forgotten Greek Revival . Two very important results followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primarily a designer and no longer a builder as well . The first was artistic liberation ; the sec-ond was place liberation . Once an architect was recognized as a creative individuality there was an instant challenge to his inven-tiveness quite different from the traditional pressure of the earlier // system ; the architect had much greater opportunity for experiment when designing for an individual client who trusted him than when working for a builder and an anonymous owner . Thus , as professional architecture advanced , style freedom increased and eclecticism began to appear , though as yet only tentatively . In general the best works of the period , like many of the Davis houses and much of Lafever 's work , are freely creative rather than eclectic in spirit and full of plastic experiments . Hence we get such unusual developments as Lafever 's Bartow house in the Bronx ? with its simple stone facade , its ample scale , and its rich interior detail ? and all of the vital though sometimes erratic experiments that distinguished the Davis work of the 1840 's and are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creative , and inventive mind . Where mere copying or archaeological correctness has dominated , this seems in most cases to have resulted through the influence of some dilettante owner rather than through the taste of the architect . The second effect of this rise of professionalism , a liberation from working in one place , was as important in its effect on the country as a whole . When the architect is a builder his work necessarily is restricted to an area close to his office , but once he is accepted as a designer working through other contractors there is no limit to the area in which his designs can be built save that of time and practicability . We have already seen how the works of Isaiah Rogers dot almost the entire country east of the Mississippi , and this was even more the case with the firm of Town and Davis . Town was much away from the office , in the South and in the Middle West , partly no doubt in connection with his bridges and also frankly as a sort of contact man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana , and Illinois came from the firm 's office , and Davis was called in as consultant in connection with the Ohio capitol . Educational buildings by the firm included Alumni Hall at Yale , the Virginia Military Institute , an elaborate series of designs for the University of Michigan , and Davidson College in North Carolina . Town and Davis were also the architects for the North Carolina Hospital for the Insane , and their // long list of domestic work includes examples in Maryland , Michi-gan , Virginia , and New England . Thus , powerful influences spread out widely from this New York center and helped set the standards that made even the lo-cal vernacular architecture unusually successful . Moreover , men trained in the New York offices themselves settled and worked in other places often far removed . For example , the second Robert Cary Long of Baltimore was at one time a draftsman for Martin Thompson and signed some of the Columbia Grammar School drawings ; James Gallier was a partner of Lafever for a year before he left for New Orleans ; and James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural commissions in New Or-leans during the forties and fifties , was a student and later a part-ner of Town and Davis . How many other similar examples there were it would be impossible to state without more accurate informa-tion than we now possess concerning the make-up of these New York offices , but the slight indications we do have seem to show a much greater number than one would get , say in Boston , where the influence was chiefly local . Throughout the southern half of the country at the time and in some of the more northern parts of the West the high standard of this architecture , achieved so soon after the forests had been cut down to allow settlement , again and again stems from two great sources : first , the pupils of Strickland , trac-ing as it were their artistic heritage through him back to Mills and Latrobe ; and , second , the influence of the New York offices . For that reason the importance of the Greek Revival in New York can hardly be overstressed . // THE PROVINCIAL GREEK REVIVAL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the greater amount of early American architecture outside the large cities as the work of a sort of folk culture , the spontaneous creation of unknown craftsmen who , by virtue of some forgotten magic , produced out of their inner consciousness , with few or no drawings , the buildings we love and admire . It is of course true that popular taste was high in the early nineteenth century and demanded design of beautiful clarity ; to that extent , at least , we may call this country Greek Revival a people 's art . Yet the more we examine it , the more we search all the records , and the more we know of the conditions under which it was produced , the more we must realize that behind these buildings were individual designers , that plans were made and elevations drawn before the structures arose , and that the forms the buildings took were consciously created . Much the same change in judgment has been necessary here as that which has during the last half century revolutionized our conception of the Gothic cathedral builders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our enlarged acquaintance with the original source material have forced the abandonment of the old romantic theory of the cathedrals as spontaneous creations of a people 's soul ; we know now that great buildings have had great designers , and out of the mists of the past the architects are gradually emerging . So , here in America , little by little research is proving that our Late Colonial and Classic Revival architecture was designed . The designers may have called themselves builders , hut in actual fact they were architects as well ; one is constantly amazed at discovering the number of those who chose the professional rather than the craft title , and many of them were actual // professional men in work as well as in name . Thus in the Boston city directory in 1846 ? 7 there were twenty architects , in 1848 ? 9 twenty-five ; in the Detroit directory of 1837 at least six men so called themselves . New Orleans , during the period of its great prosperity from 1835 to 1855 , had among others the Galliers , father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several members of the Freret family ; Louisville had Shryock , who worked in many localities in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys ; and Providence had J. H. Greene , J. C. Bucklin , and Russell Warren . Mr. Frary 1 has discovered the names and works of many architects and builders of this period in Ohio , and Professor Burns 2 has done the same for Indiana . Everywhere that intensive research in the history of these lovely towns and villages has been carried on , the same story has been true ; the beautiful churches , the handsome courthouses , the welcoming and dignified houses did not just happen ? they were planned , and they were beautiful because someone had so conceived them and seen that they were built according to his conception . To list all these architects is as yet impossible ; an immense amount of research is still to be done . The picture of the New York architectural world in those decades , from 1820 to 1850 , is fairly clear ; we know much about the Boston , Philadelphia , Washington , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cities the picture grows confused , and only future local study can clarify it . Yet the indications are that material still exists , at least in many places , and , properly sifted , would help us to learn who the men were who built these structures spread so widely over the eastern half of the country , who so rapidly in the West changed wilderness and forest into lovely towns and designed the dignified columned mansions of Rennebunk or Nantucket or Ann Arbor . We find the work of Asher Benjamin and Elias Carter dotted over western and central Massachusetts . Benjamin 's refined and simplified American versions of Adam and Pain ( e ) detail decorate // his Coleman house at Greenfield , some of the houses in Windsor , Vermont , and the West Church in Boston , now a public library . To Carter we owe the best of the Greek Revival work of Worcester ? those great square houses with dignified continuous two-story colonnades that constitute the unique type he created ; his churches are less known and less unusual . We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beautiful churches in Northampton , Massachusetts . We have the names of Henry and Robert Sikes and Chauncey Shepard , architects who worked in the Connecticut Val-ley . Our picture of their work and their personalities , however , is still for the most part vague and perplexing . Around New Haven it was Colonel Belcher with his character istic naive variations of Pain detail ? witness his Old Lyme Con gregational Church ? who set the character ; later it was Hoadley ( 1774-1839 ) , who designed among many other houses the Noah Webster house in New Haven , and became in the late twenties and thirties the local representative of Town and Davis . Town started his practice with the Center and Trinity churches in New Haven ? the one a characteristic example of the Late Colonial Gibbs-type meeting house , the other the earliest Gothic Revival church in New England ? and went on with ever increasing power and variety , without doubt introducing Greek forms into Connecticut in the Doric porches of various New Haven houses built before his departure for New York . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Austin , who was the fashionable architect of all cen tral Connecticut throughout the late thirties , forties , and fifties , working first in the Greek Revival manner and later in the Brack eted ' style , producing villas with broad spreading cornices , flat roofs , and large window and wall spaces that sometimes show more vivid imagination than restraint . His work reached its zenith in the extraordinary New Haven railroad station , with its ingenious , // prophetically modern , two-level plan ( the waiting room and offices above , extending over the tracks , and the platforms below ) and its fantastic Moorish ' detail . In Maine the early houses of Alexander Parris in Portland are but one example of how the work of an accomplished architect gives character and sets the tone of a locality . Farther east the quiet solid beauty of the houses that prosperous shipowners and captains built along the harbors of Ellsworth and Bluehill , Colum bia Falls and Machias , during the twenties and thirties , is famous and was long taken for granted as an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know that the proportions of these buildings were consciously planned , their spare and delicate detail consciously applied . That exquisite string of lavish churches in Bluehill , ' East Bluehill , and the neighborhood , climaxed by the magnificent colonnade and tower of the Ellsworth church , ' are the work of Thomas Lord of Bluehill . He was proud of them ; some of his drawings still exist , and in his old age he set down with obvious pride a list of the buildings he had designed . ' // So it is wherever the history of Greek Revival buildings has been carefully studied . These sea captains were traveled men of culture and taste ; they demanded , and received , the best for the buildings they needed . The settlers who built so many of the towns of Ohio and Michigan and Illinois and Tennessee were , many of them , not the picturesque pioneers of fiction ; they were solid citi zens with the polished background of New England or Maryland or Virginia behind them , men who read widely and much , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men brought up on the Bible and Shakespeare and Milton . They were eager readers of Byron . They were men who started academies and colleges in the town they created almost as soon as the forests had been cut down . The conservatism of the older parts of New England is evi denced by the persistence of the Late Colonial traditions and forms until almost the middle of the nineteenth century , through large parts of Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and up the Connecticut Valley into Vermont and New Hampshire . In many villages the influence of the Greek Revival is hardly apparent at all ; only in details here and there do Greek forms appear . Occa sionally a Greek Doric porch was added to an older house ; more frequently the entire house was built at one time according to the older traditions , and observed the new fashion only in its entrance and porch and perhaps in the heavier proportions and Greek pro-files of its mantels and interior trim . From 1800 on , the country work obviously is deeply indebted to the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by builder-architects who had studied at his architectural school in Boston . And just as he is slightly grudging in his atti tude toward the Greek detail after 1826 , when he first shows the Greek orders in the fifth edition of The American Builder 's Com panion , ? so it is with this country work in large parts of New England . The other Benjamin books ? The Practical House Car164 GREEK REVIVAL ARCHITECTURE penter ( called The Architect ; or , Practical House Carpenter in the 1841 and subsequent editions ) , ' the Practice of Architecture , ' and The Builder 's Guide 1 ? ? show Greek ' doorways and fron-tispieces ' and give profiles of the new , broader trims , but that is all except in the last , in which the designs are more lavish and more Greek . " And what he does with the Greek detail used is equally characteristic : he makes it all rather heavy , almost stodgy , trying unconsciously to bring it within the earlier , more Roman , classic tradition ; there is in it little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the most refined rosettes and anthemions which characterize the Greek Revival books of Minard Lafever . Later the books of Edward Shaw 12 became almost equally in-fluential . Shaw 's Civil Architecture " must have been exceedingly popular . First published complete in 1831 , it had reached its fourth edition by 1835 ; it continued being published for forty years and more , its last edition being the eleventh , of which several printings were issued in Philadelphia until as late as 1876 . It is more of a complete builder 's and architect 's handbook than are the Benja-min items ; it has fewer designs and details , though more material on geometry , mensuration , and construction . But Shaw 's Rural Architecture 14 has many designs of houses and churches that ex-erted a wide influence . The popularity of these books perhaps evi-dences the growing complexity of the building trades and the greater thoroughness that was required of builders and architects in this period . The plates included are thoroughly in the Boston tradition . Shaw 's Greek Revival design has the same forthright heaviness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust beauty . For both men , the Greek fret took the place of the rosettes and an-themions of Lafever . Thus throughout New England one finds a wide use of the fret , usually of simple type and large in size , em-ployed for panel decorations , for lintels , and even for pilasters . This use is often crude and is absolutely without Greek precedent ; in the later years of the movement ( in the late forties and fifties ) these New England frets became formless and diffuse . " Shaw 's influence was not limited to his books , but came also from the actual buildings he designed . His practice was wide-spread and , like the plates in his books , not limited to Greek Re-vival forms ; it shows him an early and eager supporter of the Gothic styles that were beginning to come into use . Thus , although much of his work is Greek , the wooden churches of Machias and East Machias , Maine , are in a charmingly original type of Car-penter Gothic . The design for East Machias was published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Rural Architecture , which also shows another Gothic church design much like that at Machias . In Addison , Maine , there is a story-and-a-half house with a Greek Doric porch which much resembles plates in Shaw 's Rural Architecture . The simplest Ionic house ' shown has also many Maine descendants . In Manchester , New Hampshire , too , there is a handsome Gothic city hall from his design . Another important handbook for New England builders was Chester Hills 's The Builder 's Guide.15 This work has complete-ness as its chief merit , together with the fact that its lithographed // plates of the orders are on a larger scale than those of Benjamin and Lafever . Several of its designs are taken line for line from Peter Nicholson ; its doorways and porches are modifications of designs published earlier by Minard Lafever or Edward Shaw . Hills , the complete eclectic in his book , was an architect of some note in Hartford , Connecticut , where he had a large practice . It is possible that much of the simpler and more conventional work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carpenter 's Assistant , by William Brown , " is an interesting handbook of the later period when Gothic ' and Italian ' designs were becoming as popular as Greek . ' But in all this New England work so largely based on earlier Colonial ideas , in its detail frequently so superficial and at times so crude , there is a basic faithfulness to climate and materials which inevitably produces minor regionalisms within the larger pattern . The stone buildings that grew up around the quarries of New Hampshire and Cape Ann are characteristic examples ; the use of this relatively intractable material forced in them the sim-plicity and power that the granite buildings of Boston possess . Similar regional expressions are to be found in the relatively low roof slopes and compactness of plan , together with the somewhat smaller window openings , typical of many Maine houses of the time , as well as in the common New England country practice of combining house , sheds , wood shed , outhouse , and barn into one long composition , frequently L-shaped , as a protection against savage winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called story-and-a-half house with all the chief living rooms and bedrooms on the ground floor is another example of the results of a more realistic acceptance of climate and living ways . This of course is not limited to New England but is found in New Jersey , New York , and the North generally ? wherever , in fact , the discovery has been made that many of the old , typically Colonial two-story houses with through halls and much waste space are likely to be cold and // drafty.17 But the whole period was notable for a new attack on the problems of house planning , wherever the old traditions did not interfere . The new attitudes that governed the Greek Revival period thus had their greatest opportunity in the rapidly growing towns ( especially those without too long a history ) and in the newly settled parts of the country , like eastern Maine . Bangor , for instance , was increasing rapidly in size as the lumber trade poured wealth into its coffers , and thus grew up as an essentially Greek Revival community , with impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It called chiefly on Boston architects ? on Rogers for its grand hotel , on Upjohn for several houses and its epoch-making Gothic Episcopal church.16 But the local designers must have been apt pupils , and the great houses that line Broadway in Bangor are eloquent of the beauty of their work . Similarly Belfast , with its prosperous shipping and shipbuilding trade , became a town of handsome square Greek houses of a definitely recognizable type , a fact which seems to argue the existence of some brilliant though occasionally erratic local architect.18 Farther east , Bluehill , Ellsworth , Harrison , Columbia Falls , Machias , and other towns were booming , and lovely house after lovely house , white church after white church , shows an extraordinarily high standard of Greek Revival design . Some of them we know // were the work of Captain Lord 210 of Bluehill , but adequate re-search would undoubtedly rescue the names of other capable and well-trained designers . The general picture in Massachusetts is more confused . Here local traditions were strong , and it was in the newer towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nantucket and New Bedford , which the whale fisheries were rocketing into promi-nence ; in Worcester , then so rapidly growing ; in Northampton and Amherst , where the existence of a definite group of the intelli-gentsia fostered the new movement ; and up and down the Con-necticut River valley . Of course the newer churches everywhere were chiefly in the Greek vein , although Massachusetts was already well supplied with churches . The Parish Church at Concord , with its Greek Doric portico and an excellent tower and spire , is char-acteristic of these newer structures . Nantucket as we see it today owes much of its quality to the period between 1820 and 1850 . New Bedford owed its greatest Greek Revival monument ? the late la-mented John Avery Parker ( Bennett ) house ( 1834 ) , built all of stone ? to Russell Warren of Providence , who also designed the charming little New Bedford railroad station done in a free Egyp-tian manner , as well as the great granite city hall of 1837 ? 8 ( now part of the public library ) , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass and material , refined and origi-nal in detail . The famous granite customs house of New Bedford is from the designs of Robert Mills . " But there must have been local architects too . Richard Upjohn , shortly after his arrival from England , found there his first profitable employment , in 1830 , as draftsman for a builder and lumber dealer , one Samuel Leonard . Later , in 1833 , it was there he first began to practice as an independent architect.22 Nantucket 23 is especially interesting as showing the ideal the // town builders of these prosperous towns were seeking to realize . A great fire in 1846 wiped out much of the older part of town and almost all of its business area . The town was then at the peak of its whaling prosperity , and it set about rebuilding at once ; the lovely brick business buildings which line the north side of Main Street show perfectly the restraint , the large scale , the power of mass composition , and the simplicity of classic detail which were all part of this ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire elms were planted along both sides of Main Street and along some of the other important streets . Evidently it was important to these practical-minded merchants and sea captains not only to have buildings beautiful in proportion and adequate in dignity , but also to add to them the green of foliage and the gracious shadow of trees . The Methodist Church at Nantucket , with a large , well-detailed Ionic portico , dates from ten years before the fire ; but the Athenaeum , with a much more richly detailed Ionic order , was built in 1847 . Its recessed in antis porch has marked individuality , and the whole building is said to resemble closely the Universalist Church which had stood on the same site before the fire . Yet with all this Greek Revival fashion the houses remain generally conservative in type . The three brick Starbuck houses on Main Street are usually called Colonial and resemble in many ways the Salem work of 1810 , but they were not built until 1885 ? 7 ; only a minor detail here and there reveals the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the same period ; it is even more conservative in its taste , for the columnar porches of the Starbuck houses are here replaced by a brick , arched , recessed porch of complete simplicity , and there is hardly a detail on the house by which it could be dated accurately . The smaller houses as well continued the standard Nantucket forms ; they preserved the old roof slopes and the four-bay scheme almost untouched , and detail of Greek inspiration or Late Colonial type seems to have been used at the same time . Perhaps the influence of conservative **43;483;TOOLONG is to be read in this // continuity . After the fire a change did creep in , and Greek forms ? at least for the larger houses ? became usual . Thus the Gris com house on Main Street , although it resembles the Starbuck houses in general composition , has a Greek order for its porch and Greek detail on the cupola , and in the houses that grew up north of Main Street after the fire Greek Doric porches became almost standard . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Re vival houses on Main Street which lift their neighboring four-column porticoes so pleasantly under the elms . One is in a simple Greek Corinthian , the other in a Greek Ionic ; the detail of both is unusually rich , sophisticated , and elegant . They were built for the two daughters in the Starbuck family ? the left-hand house , now called the Chambliss house , for Eliza , who married Nathaniel Banery ; the right-hand , the Ionic , known as the Salter house , for Eunice , who married William Hadwen . Both of these houses , like the Athenaeum , have a quality so advanced that off-island archi tects have been suggested as their designers . Thus it has been sug gested that possib , . y Russell Warren may have been the architect of the Hadwen-Salter house . The more typical local variation of the Greek Revival can best be seen in the later houses of Beach Street , Center Street , Liberty Street , Fair Street , and Orange Street . Characteristic is the Gadd house on Orange Street , with a pedimented end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a side entrance under a porch with stumpy Ionic columns . Typical too of the occasional erratic but imaginative experiments which the period frequently produced is the house at No. 4 Beach Street , where fluted columns without capitals or bases serve as the con structional posts of the house and carry a pedimented roof of some-what steep slope . The exterior house wall is set close behind the posts in precisely the same manner in which the Perret Brothers treated the posts and wall of the theater at the Paris Exposition of 1925 . In the pedimented end is an odd double window with short columns carrying a heavy , steeply sloped , triangular cap . Little has been built in the central part of Nantucket since // the Civil War . The effect of the town as one strolls through it to-day is exactly that intended by its builders of nearly a century ago . One can not help feeling that behind its beauty is much more than the charm of the antique ; there is a definite sense of com position , of balance of greenery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of materials , of intelligent street layout and humane land usage which , taken together , combine to form one of the most harmonious and attractive of American seaport towns . One can not help feeling , also , that these qualities are not accidental ; they are the living expression of community life as the people of the Greek Revival desired it to be . Worcester is especially rich in the work of Elias Carter ( 1781-1864 ) , 24 a typical example of the New England builder-architect who changed over from an earlier devotion to the refined Late Colonial of Benjamin ( with whom at one time he had worked ) to a full understanding of the Greek Revival . He was in complete control of it , evidently having with a sure taste picked up its de-tails from books , and he became a master in making the style flex ible to his own creations . His early work , like that in Brimfield , is imaginative and refined , but it was not till he settled in Worcester in 1828 that his full talent was revealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , business blocks , and houses ; it is by the last that he is best known . His houses are large in scale , dignified and simple in mass , and wherever he could he used a two-story colonnade of Greek Doric or Ionic columns extending the full width of the house . Some people , because of these colonnades , have sought to find in them a southern influence . In reality these Worcester examples frequently pre-date many of the southern mansions . It is thus more probable that their use by Carter was a completely independent invention . Characteristic examples are the Daniel Waldo house ( 1830 ) with its interesting and unusual attic treatment , somewhat like that in some of Russell Warren 's early Bristol , Rhode Island , houses ; the Colonel Levi Lincoln house ( 1836 ) with its fasces ' - type flutes and its great simplicity ; // and especially the Colonel Simeon Burt house ( 1854 ) with its rich and delicate coping and its central cupola . The Stephen Salisbury house ( 183-8 ) , now the Worcester Red Cross center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , circular top-floor windows with wreathes , Gothic hood molds over the second-floor windows , and a one-story Greek Doric piazza , all combined into a composition of great unity , simplicity , and charm . Within , its staircase is noteworthy . The first floor has a through hall , of the old Colonial type ; the circular stair swings daringly across this , and on the second floor rises into a rotunda with delicate Corinthian columns which support a shallow coffered dome with a central skylight . The effect is graceful , gracious , and original . The trim details of the Salisbury house are firm and simple , quite in the Benjamin manner ; Carter seems to have retained his admiration for his earlier colleague , and may have been in close touch with him . Carter is said to have spent some time in Georgia . Could he have designed some of the lovely houses of Macon which are not unlike his Burt house ? Captain Lewis Bigelow was another Worcester architect of skill ; an elevation by him for a large six-columned Ionic house is preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springfield and Northampton and Amherst were the sites of an important Greek Revival development . Northampton and Amherst were in the closest touch with the intelligentsia of Boston in those decades ; the founding of Round Hill School in Northampton was watched as excitedly by Boston as by its own town.26 In the great Bowers house , by Ithiel Town , with its superb scale and magnificent Ionic colonnade , Northampton had a monument to be compared with the Parker ( Bennett ) house in New Bedford . But the smaller work was almost equally distinguished . The Dewey house ? now on the Smith College campus ? and , at Amherst , the old Boltwood house ( 1828 ) , now destroyed , which was of the same general type , both had four-columned Ionic porticoes with pediments . Both have been attributed // to George Cutler of Amherst , who may also have been the architect of much other similar work near by.26 But in some ways the most striking and original creation of the locality is the oldest group of Amherst College ? North and South colleges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer seems to have been Colonel Isaac Damon ; at least he was paid for drawings as well as for other expenses 27 and did a tre mendous amount of other work , especially bridges , up and down the valley . The conception of Amherst College , with its two almost starkly simple dormitories of 1821 and 1822 flanking the bold Greek Doric portico of the chapel , built in 1827 and crowned with a simple , square , flat-topped tower in three stages , was as new as it was superbly effective and economical . Earlier general plans , like those of Ramee for Union and of Jefferson for the University of Vir ginia , had been for groups larger and more diffuse . The earlier New England colleges had all been , like Dartmouth , of the Colonial or Late Colonial type . Harvard , with its first buildings on three sides of a quadrangle , and Yale , with its long rows of simple struc tures , represented the most that had been achieved in collegiate group structures in New England . But the Amherst buildings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , for New England , new . Superbly set on the summit of a hill , these buildings had a great effect . One sees them perfectly in the famous engraving after an A. J. Davis drawing made prob ably in 1828 , shortly after their completion . In Connecticut too the picture varies ? from the basic con servatism of many farmhouses to the almost cosmopolitan moder nity of New Haven , Hartford , and Middletown . Connecticut in striving especially for richly delicate exterior effects had devel oped some of the loveliest and most refined of Late Colonial expres sions , and we find here a lavish use of Palladian windows , rich thin // cornices less erratic and inventive than Benjamin 's , and occasion-ally slim two-story pilasters or , as in Farmington and Litchfield , two-story free-standing columns . Connecticut emigrants carried this delicacy of touch with them westward into western New York , the Western Reserve of Ohio ( as in the exquisite church of Tall-madge , so like that at Lyme , Connecticut , or as in the house on the grounds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , where it bloomed again to rival the more up-to-date Greek structures . The touch is particularly apparent in some of the houses of Ann Arbor . It is not strange that a style of such peculiar and delicate loveliness as that of Essex , of Litchfield , or of Newton should linger long in the work of the older builders like Isaac Damon and Colonel Belcher.28 Yet the influence that radiated from New Haven , Hartford , and Middletown was essentially that of the new Greek fashion . The importance of New Haven as a radical , cultural center in the period between the War of 1812 and , say , 1885 was enormous . It was no accident that Timothy Dwight 's famous letters 29 are full of an acute aesthetic sensitiveness , as evidenced in remarkable pleas for // city beauty and architectural magnificence . It was no accident that Colonel Trumbull gave to Yale his famous collection of paintings in return for an annuity , and designed the gallery that the college built to house them . Ithiel Town , though born in Thompson , Con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in New York , seemed to consider New Haven his real home , and built there the famous house and library for his superb collection of books and engravings so admired by Mrs. Sigourney . " Town 's importance in spreading the gospel of the Greek Revival can not be forgotten ; although one of his two New Haven churches is in the Late Colo nial vein and the other in the Gothic , it seems likely that it was he who , in the years before he went to New York in 1826 , designed many of the staid New Haven houses with Greek Doric porches . " It was also Town who , in the state capitol ( 1827 ? 31 ) he built on the green in New Haven , produced the first Greek Doric temple in New England ? a structure that gave the green an unusually classic appearance . In 1828 Abram Hillhouse invited Town and his new partner , Davis , to design the famous Hillhouse place , Sachem 's Wood , with its graceful Ionic portico and its handsome mass and original plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the owner ; the houses that soon rose along it ( chiefly for his friends ) were Greek also , some designed by Town and Davis ( including Town 's own home ) and some by a young protege and pupil of Town 's , Henry Austin ( 1804 ? 91 ) . The Austin houses are gener ally of the so-called Italian villa ' type . Similar Greek houses // began to blossom all over the city and in other towns near by . The Russell house ( 1828 ? 30 ) at Middletown , by Town and Davis , which now belongs to Wesleyan University , was superintended by Hoadley , one of the older builder-architects ; but its design is in the richest Greek vein and its Corinthian columns and open plan are urban and magnificent rather than in the simple old tradi-tion . " The columns were those intended originally for Town 's Eagle Bank in New Haven ; the bank failed and the building was never carried to completion . There is much other good Greek work in Middletown . The Alsop house ( 1838 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin and to Town and to a Connecticut architect , Henry A. Sikes , of Suffield ; 33 but its unique plan and its quite different character suggest the possibility of still other designers . Large in scale , with an impressive suite of living and drawing rooms across the front , it is set apart by its delicate iron porch and its light bracketed cornice as well as by the grisaille statues in niches and the decorative painted frieze which enhance its other-wise severely simple walls . Its interior color decoration is famous ; it has been attributed to Brumidi ( who later worked under Thomas U. Walter on the United States Capitol ) and has been dated as late as 1849 or 1850.34 I am inclined to believe , however , that this decoration is by some other wandering French or Italian painter , and dates from the time of the completion of the house.35 Such rich polychrome interiors were less rare than we think . The For-rest house in New York as well as some of those on Washington // Square North had rich wall decorations done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from a letter of Latrobe we know that as early as 1808 Latrobe 's William Waln house in Philadelphia was frescoed 38 with scenes based on Flaxman 's illus-trations for the Iliad or Odyssey and painted in flat Etruscan // colors ' by George Bridport , the brother of Hugh Bridport , Havi land 's co-author in The Builders ' Assistant ( 1819-21 ) .37 In the Alsop house there is a certain : oreign ' character ; its plain wall surfaces , its thin cornice , and its iron porch all have a flavor almost pure Regency , as though borrowed from a design from Ackermann 's Repository 38 or one of the English colored-aquatint architectural books of an earlier generation.39 Could it possibly be the work of some English-born architect , like Havi land ? Or is it the work of some New York or Boston designer ? a man , say , like A. J. Davis , Martin Thompson , Isaiah Rogers , Josiah Brady , or Minard Lafever ? carrying out the special wishes of a very special and wealthy client ? Only a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no mention of it in the Davis papers , and we have an almost complete list of his work ; yet , of all the group , his work alone shows occasionally a similar freedom . Scattered through the villages and towns of Connecticut there are hundreds of attractive Greek Revival houses and many beau tiful churches ; this would indicate a great growth in population and prosperity in the thirties and forties , despite the panic of 1837 . Hartford and New Haven were once dotted with such struc tures , and far-away Windham County in the northeast corner of the state boasts several , especially the monumental Perkins house ( 1832 ) at Windham , with its large scale and its dignified four-column Ionic portico . Even conservative Litchfield has the simple W. H. Sanford house ( 1832 ) , built by Dr. Alanson Abbey , with its severe Greek Doric colonnade on three sides and its simple hipped roof . But it is the Greek Revival churches of Connecticut which best show the architecture of the period , perhaps only because they have suffered less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the extraordinary thing is the way the same qualities of firm design , appropriate detail , and a basic grasp of architectonic consistency hold sway in the simplest ones ? mere small gabled rectangles , perhaps with paneled pilasters at the corners and a square belfry ? as well as in the richest and most complex , like the church at Suffield , which combines a six-column Ionic portico with one of the most exquisite spires in New England , rising from an octagon of Greek Corinthian columns , urn-crowned . The church at Milford is a typical example of the dignity and the beauty of these Connecticut Greek Revival churches ; its tower is especially successful in proportion , and it is strong yet delicate in detail . Connecticut had always been distinguished for its churches ? the old church by Belcher at Lyme and the beautiful church ( 1818 ) by Elias Carter at Killingly are but two examples ? and the gradual adaptation of Greek forms to church design merely gave this tradition a new impetus . The lovely church at East Hartford , with its hexastyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the earlier West Hartford church with Ionic columns in antis , perhaps by the same designer , are characteristic . And , in the southeast corner of the state , Stonington was growing rapidly from the fruits of its shipping and its boatbuilding in these years ; naturally , like Nantucket or New Bedford , its buildings are largely Greek . Especially interesting are the customs house ( possibly another Robert Mills design ) ; the First National Bank , a simple Greek Doric four-column temple ; the Arcade market ; and the Second Congregational Church , with its four-column Doric portico and its square Ionic tower crowned with a cubical attic for the clock . However , it was in the smallest of the New England states , Rhode Island , that the Greek Revival was perhaps most successful and its monuments most notable . Many things contributed to this . Not only did Narragansett Bay furnish perfect harbors for a growing trade in those days , but at the same time industry ? especially the textile industry ? was , in Rhode Island , enjoying an unexampled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters were principally men of high ideals and
