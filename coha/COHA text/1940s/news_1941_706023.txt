txt A. F. L. BANS STRIKE International Heads of Unions Back Navy in San Diego Clash ORDER MEN TO RETURN Government Acts to Fill Jobs From Civil Service Lists as It Adopts Drastic Policy By CHARLES HURD Special to Tait NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , Nov. 10 ? A strike of building trades workers on naval construction projects in the San Diego area was outlawed by American Federation of Labor leaders here tonight within a few hours after the Navy Department had ordered the commandant there to proceed with the work despite the strike , which he characterized " open revolt against the United States Government . " Rear AdMiral Blakely , commandant of the Eleventh Naval District , today began recruiting workers from civil service lists to fill the jobs of the men who had quit . Richard Gray , acting president of the American Federation of Labor Building Trades and Construction Department , announced late this evening that the presidents of all the international unions involved except the carpenters had I ordered their members to return to ? work tomorrow morning . He had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Workers on three naval construction projects at San Diego went on strike Thursday to enforce demands for wage increases of a dollar a day . The Navy ordered the strikers to return to work at 8 A. M. today on penalty of losing their jobs . The San Diego Building and Construction Trades Council ordered a general strike for the deadline hour set by the Navy . This strike extended the strike today to about 3,500 men on more than $23,000,000 of projects . Navy Action Is Speedy Informed that the general strike had gone into effect , the Navy Department adopted the fastest and most direct action yet used by the government in a defense strike . Shortly after noon it announced despatch of its orders to Rear Admiral Charles A. Blakely , commandant of the Eleventh Naval District . At the same time it accused the trades unions affected of bad faith and repudiation of contracts . The Navy 's statement charged that K. G. Bitter , secretary of the San Diego Trades Council , " submitted an ultimatum that the full demands of the unions must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration as provided for by the formal agreement between the government and the unions . " " Under the circumstances , " it added , " the Navy Department takes the position that there is no alternative but to inform the commandant that the work must go forward with such labor as can be obtained for the purpose . " Behind the formal phraseology of the Navy 's announcement was the obvious decision to give armed protection if necessary to men who report for work and for delivery of materials and equipment . If necessary , workers are to be recruited from civil service rolls . Special Factors in Situation Today 's action is considerably different from that imposed by the Army when it reopened the North American Aviation plant and by the Navy when it halted a strike at the Federal Shipyards . In each of those cases the property and facilities constituted a unit . In San Diego County the building operations are scattered over a wide area . Accordingly , the orders issued to Admiral Blakely may require a variety of operations , ranging from protection of working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the possible scope of the operation presumably had been assessed before the Navy issued its orders . The Navy expressed the hope that State , county and municipal officials would cooperate in maintaining order . but made clear its intention to handle that on its own volition if necessary . " This strike is called , " the Navy stated , " in defiance of the agreement made with the American Federation of Labor covering construction trades and in defiance of . the Labor Division of the Office of Production Management . It ignores the wage determinations of the Department of Labor and the Navy ' Department . Furthermore , it repudiates a no-strike agreement which had been entered into and it refuses larbitration . " After announcing that Admiral Blakely had been ordered to act , i , the statement continued : " The commandant has been authorized to take title to all materials at point of origin under all contracts and to vehicles belong ' ing to the contractors on the various naval projects . Under such action they become the property of the government and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commandant has been instructed to request municipal , county and State authorities to maintain order and afford protection to persons and property off lgovernment reservations and to maintain free access to government reservations . " He also has been instructed to have readily available naval and Marine guards to protect government property and to maintain order on government reservations , and , in the event of failure of the State , county and municipal authorities to do so , to assure free access to all employes who desire to work on government reservations and the maintenance of order in the vicinity thereof . " History of Dispute Offered The Navy also issued its own version of the situation in San Diego in a " chronological history " which read as follows : " On Oct. 16 , 1941 , the Navy Department was informed that the Building Trades Council of San Diego had made certain demands on the Contractors ' Association of San Diego County for increases in wages , and that the Contractors Association had informed the Building Trades Council that they could not agree to these increases without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense work in this area is being performed . " The matter was referred to the Navy Department by the commandant , Eleventh Naval District . Mr. K. G. Bitter , secretary of the San Diego Building Trades Council , was sent to Washington by his council to negotiate with the Navy Department . " A meeting was called by the chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks to discuss this matter . At this meeting there were representatives of Mr. Sidney Hillman 's office ( OPM ) , and the acting president of the Building and Construction Trades Department , American Federation of Labor . " After considerable discussion of increases in living costs in San Diego County , wage rates being paid in neighboring counties , and recent determinations of prevailing wage rates by the Department of Labor , the chief of the Bureau of Yards  --  and Docks proposed a settlement along the following lines : " That wage rates in San Diego County would be established to bring them into conformity with the wage rates adopted in agreement between the Southern California Associated General Contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This agreement applies to all of Southern California except San Diego County . ) The agreement expires in April , 1942 . Widening of Pact Proposed " It was proposed that at that time , namely , April , 1942 , all of Southern California would be brought under the same wage rates and working conditions by agreement between the Building Trades Unions and Associated General Contractors , with the concurrence of the Federal construction agencies . " In order to be entirely fair to the San Diego Building Trades Council , the chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks proposed that wherever a wage rate had been determined for San Diego County by the Department of Labor , and such rate was in excess of the f agreed-upon rate in the contract between the Building Trades Union and the Associated Contractors , the higher rate would be adopted . " In other words , the Navy Department proposed that the higher of the two rates under consideration would prevail in every case . " This proposed settlement met with the instant approval of the acting president of the Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor representative and the representatives of the other construction agencies of the Federal Government . " Mr. Bitter , secretary of the San Diego Building Trades Council , stated that he would have to submit it to his council , but he doubted whether it would be accepted . " It was pointed out that the proposed settlement would grant all of the wage increases requested by the BuildinglTrades Council with the exception of the laborers ( 75 cents per hour , for whom no increase was granted ) ; carpenters , who would obtain an increase of five cents per hour in lieu of the 121/2 cents requested ; the cement finishers ( $1.25 per hour , no increase ) , and the roofers 121/2 cents increase , as against 25 cents requested . " Mr. Bitter stated that he would return to San Diego and present the matter to his union . Upon his return the Navy Department received word that the unions Would accept nothing less than their complete demands . " Thereupon the Secretary of the Navy sent a dispatch to the unions requesting that there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Board of Review established by the agreement between the Federal Construction Agencies and the American Federation of Labor unions . " At the same time the acting president of the Building Trades Department - ( A . F. of L. ) ordered Mr. Bitter to see that there be no stoppage of work and to submit the matter to arbitration by the Board of Review . " Mr. Bitter replied , stating in effect that he saw no useful purpose to be gained by submitting the question to the Board of , Review , since two members of the board had voiced an opinion in the case . In other words , Mr. Bitter submitted an ultimatum that the full demands of the unions must be met and that the question would not be submitted to arbitration as provided for by the formal agreement between the government and the unkons . " Under the circumstances , the Navy Department takes the position that there is no alternative but to inform the Commandant that the work ? must go forward with such labor as can be obtained for the purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
