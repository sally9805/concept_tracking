txt his more eager son , Edgar , by his side , and lean , swarthy Oscar Cox , former Counsel of the Lend-Lease Administration , there to help him out with the difficult job of counting up and throwing away the millions . Mr. Kaiser , by his own count , now heads 18 distinct industries . He mass-produced Liberty ships in the recent war . Mr. Kaiser , by nearly every reckoning , is one of the most remarkable men in the United States . He has not lost his temper with the baffled Committee . There he has sat , elderly , avuncular , forthgoing , the very ifnage , it would seem , of sweet reasonableness . And today the Committee finally let him go , let him go with one question still not answered , the central question of the inquiry : Is Henry J. Kaiser a patriot or a profiteer ? Did he come out of the war a debtor , or a creditor ' . ' Using Maritime Commission figures , the General Accounting Office declares the Kaiser family made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so on a shoestring of $2 , . - 500,000 in personal investment . Huge Kaiser Losses ? That seems simple . But yesterday Mr , Cox , after testifying before the Committee , took reporters in Mild , told them to take a big breath , and declared that Kaiser-ajliated companies , in the shipbuilding field , suffered a net loss of $13,000,000 , because of side ventures into steel and magnesium . " This is a personal question , " interjected Representative Samuel K. McConnell , Jr . ( R ) of Pennsylvania . " Are you solvent ? " The room tittered. it was one of the questions reporters wanted to ask , Conflicting as these estimates seem , however , they are capable of being reconciled , in large part . But that really is n't the point . The big point , as the testimony of Kaiser , father and son , asserts , is that the putative profits of the shipbuilding operations were really taken by Mr. Kaiser in the form of a ' big magnesium plant , acid a bi steel plant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether these plants are worth anything depends , of course , on whether they can be operated at a profit . Just at preent , they ar n't . Here is the detailed financial picture as Mr. Cox set it down for reporters : 1 . The Kaiser Company , Inc. , received $41,000,000 in fees and profits for operating three shipyards , and $5,000,000 from three additional yards , not wholly controlled . 2 . Against this $46,000,000 profit , the Kaiser Company lost $59,000,000 in operating the Fontana Steel Plant , built in 1942 to supply steel for the Kaiser shipyards . Net loss ? $13,000,000 . Plant Losing Money 4 . However , one Kaiser Company came out of the war with a $26,000,000 magnesium plant , paid for in full out of profits . This is now losing $50,000 a month in a shut-down condition but Kaiser research indicates it may later do sensational things . Mr. Kaiser kept affable and calm through most of three days ' grilling , probably because of one agreeable fact : he has already been investigated by a Senate Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Truman . That bipartisan Senate Committee admired the Kaiser methods . Big as the costs were , it declared that Mr. Kaiser turned out fleets of ships in a hurry . In its formal report it indicated that the Kaiser outfit had built these ships $250,000,000 cheaper than anybody else could have built them . That helps keep Henry Kaiser calm and unruffled.
