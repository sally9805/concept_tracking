Holy Cross had just beaten Boston College : downtown Boston was full of men &; women eager to celebrate or console . Many of them wound up at Cocoanut Grove : they stood crowded around the dimly lighted downstairs bar , filled the tables around the dance floor upstairs . With them mingled the usual Saturday night crowd : soldiers &; sailors , a wedding party , a few boys being seen off to Army camps . <P> At 10 o'clock Bridegroom John O'Neil , who had planned to take his bride to their new apartment at the stroke of the hour , lingered on a little longer . The floor show was about to start . Through the big revolving door , couples moved in &; out . <P> At the downstairs bar , a 16-year-old busboy stood on a bench to replace a light bulb that a prankish customer had removed . He lit a match . It touched one of the artificial palm trees that gave the Cocoanut Grove its atmosphere ; a few flames shot up . A girl named Joyce Spector sauntered toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat . <P> Panic 's Start . Before Joyce Spector reached the cloakroom , the Cocoanut Grove was a screaming shambles . The fire quickly ate away the palm tree , raced along silk draperies , was sucked upstairs through the stairway , leaped along ceiling and wall . The silk hangings , turned to balloons of flame , fell on table and floor . <P> Men &; women fought their way toward the revolving door ; the push of bodies jammed it . Near by was another door ; it was locked tight . There were other exits , but few Cocoanut Grove patrons knew about them . The lights went out . There was nothing to see now except flame , smoke and weird moving torches that were men &; women with clothing and hair afire . <P> The 800 Cocoanut Grove patrons pushed and shoved , fell and were trampled . Joyce Spector was knocked under a table , crawled on hands &; knees , somehow was pushed through an open doorway into the street . A chorus boy herded a dozen people downstairs into a refrigerator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few escaped by knocking out a glass brick wall . But most of them , including Bridegroom John O'Neil , were trapped . <P> Panic 's Sequel . Firemen broke down the revolving door , found it blocked by bodies of the dead , six deep . They tried to pull a man out through a side window : his legs were held tight by the mass of struggling people behind him . In an hour the fire was out and firemen began untangling the piles of bodies . One hard bitten fireman went into hysterics when he picked up a body and a foot came off in his hand . They found a girl dead in a telephone booth , a bartender still standing behind his bar . <P> At hospitals and improvised morgues which were turned into charnel houses for the night , 484 dead were counted ; it was the most disastrous U.S. fire since 571 people were killed in Chicago 's Iroquois Theater holocaust in 1903 . One Boston newspaper ran a two-word banner line : BUSBOY BLAMED . But the busboy had not put up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact that Boston 's laws do not require nightclubs to have fireproof fixtures , sprinkler systems or exit markers.
