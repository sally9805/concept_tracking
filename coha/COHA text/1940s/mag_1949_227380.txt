In a fourth-floor office of the State Department this week , busy aides thumbed diligently through top-secret policy papers on German-Austrian affairs . George Kennan , expert on U.S.-Soviet policies , slipped off to a secret sanctum where he could think things through beyond the reach of visitors and telephones . In other offices , other State Department experts put their heads together and seriously pretended that they were Russians . If they were , what would they plan to do next ? <P> This Thursday , by the U.S.S.R. 's promise , the Berlin blockade will be lifted . Eleven days later , the Council of Foreign Ministers will meet in Paris to discuss the future of Germany ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . U.S. officialdom this week was like a man who had been pushing against a door which someone had been holding shut from the other side . Now , suddenly , the door was thrown open . There , nodding and smiling enigmatically , was the U.S.S.R. <P> Whatever Russia 's future intentions , the events of last week had produced the most dramatic break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax to a strange new pattern in diplomatic tactics , which had casually begun in the U.N . delegates ' lounge at Lake Success and had come to a head a fortnight ago with the first hint of U.S.-Russian agreement on Berlin . <P> <P> By Subway . On Monday of last week , a thin-nosed man with a humorously etched face , wearing crepe-soled sport shoes and a rumpled brown suit , got out of the plane which had flown him from Washington to New York . He sped by car to 2 Park Avenue , headquarters for the U.S. delegation to U.N . There at his desk he wrote a letter . He was Dr. Philip Jessup , onetime college professor and the State Department 's top negotiator . He gave the letter to an aide , Albert Bender , to deliver to Yakov Malik , of the Russian U.N . delegation . <P> By Lexington Avenue subway Bender rode up to 68th Street . He walked into a stone mansion at 680 Park Avenue . Some children , playing in the hall , shouted " Zdravstvuite , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet U.N . delegation 's headquarters . Bender presented Dr. Jes-sup 's letter . <P> By Telephone . That evening and through the next day Jessup waited for his reply . In other offices in Manhattan , France 's Jean Chauvel and Britain 's Alexander Cadogan also waited . At 6 p.m. on Tuesday , a little man named O. A. Tro-yanovsky , whose father had been the first Soviet ambassador appointed to the U.S. , arrived at Jessup 's office with Malik 's reply . <P> There was momentary confusion ; Malik 's letter was written in Russian . Aides found a translator . Finally , Jessup got on the telephone . He passed the word to Cadogan and Chauvel that Malik had agreed to meet with them . The first meeting of Four Power spokesmen since last winter 's fruitless discussions in Geneva on the subject of the Berlin blockade was set for 12:30 the next day .
