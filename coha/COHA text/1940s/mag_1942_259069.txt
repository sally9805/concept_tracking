Newsmen in North Africa last week discovered Lieut . Colonel Elliott Roosevelt at the head of a photographic unit in Major General Jimmy Doolittle 's Twelfth Air Force . Said Roosevelt 's pilot , Major Harry Eidson : " You 've got to hand it to Roosevelt . That plane we fly is just big enough for two of us , and he is a big man - so big he can not even wear a parachute . You know what that would mean if we got winged . That takes what we politely call fortitude . " <P> Up from captain since he joined the Air Forces in 1940 , the President 's second oldest son ( 32 ) is a veteran of photographic flying in the Arctic , Britain and Iceland . In Africa he has one of the Air Forces ' most dangerous jobs , including what pilots and photographers call " dicing " - flying as low as 100 feet over enemy targets for close-up pictures . Roosevelt has " diced " Tunisia , Sicily and Sardinia , and last week he was still trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unit . One reason for his zeal : he knows that many men in the Army look with suspicion on " the President 's son . " <P> Last fortnight Elliott read in a Gibraltar newspaper that the Navy 's Lieut. ( j.g . ) Franklin Roosevelt was in a Philadelphia hospital , " recovering from something that happened around North Africa . " Other Roosevelts in action : Lieut . Colonel James , who took part in the Marine raid on Makin , now on duty in California ; Lieut . John , on Navy duty in San Diego .
