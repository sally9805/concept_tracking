For years the main plants of the California Conserving Co. , Inc. , and Hunt Foods , Inc. , have faced each other across the street in Hayward , Calif . As two of the oldest and biggest food-packing companies on the Pacific coast , they were naturally competitors , yet they acted more like pals . If a Hunt machine broke down , Conserving helped make Hunt products ; if Conserving had too many peaches on hand , Hunt canned them for Conserving . <P> Last week this beautiful friendship ripened into marriage . For some $3,000,000 in its own stock , Hunt bought out California Conserving . This deal , Hunt 's fourth and biggest packing company purchase in three years , made it the West Coast 's biggest food-processing company . It has 16 canning plants ( employing some 10,000 packers at peak season ) , about 70 products ( including tomato sauce , canned fruits , vegetables and jellies , frozen foods ) , expects to gross at least $35,000,000 a year . <P> The man responsible for Hunt 's spectacular leap into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aggressive Norton Simon , 38 . When he bought control of Hunt in 1942 , many housewives had never heard of Hunt Products . Simon told them by billboard , newspaper and radio so loudly and effectively that " Hunt for the Best " became a household slogan . One result : the West Coast , all but drinking Hunt 's tomato sauce like milk , now buys almost half of the 100 million cans a year they sell ( nearly five cans per capita ) . <P> Norton Simon climbed to his tin can throne by a simple formula : do n't start a business yourself ; buy up those already started and run them better . The son of a dry-goods merchant , Simon enrolled at the University of California when he was 17 . He quit a few weeks later because he was making too much money-selling paper products and from investments in a small theater where he had put his profits-to waste his time in school . He went to work for a steel-products firm , quit to buy his first business , a steel jobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made $35.000 . <P> In quick succession he bought up several small orange-juice companies , started the California Seafood Co. ( and put his father in as president ) , became principal owner of the Atlas Imperial Diesel Engine Co . When he got Hunt , he immediately expanded it by adding the dozen small food-packing plants he had cautiously bought up over a ten-year period . In this way he got expansion without the risk of launching new products . <P> Although this policy has piled up a fortune of several millions for Norton Simon , he still lives cautiously . He drives medium-priced cars , wears conservative , ready-made clothes , lives in an inexpensive old house . As yet Simon has only a taste of the food industry 's wares ; some day he hopes to control a food-processing empire comparable to Standard Brands .
