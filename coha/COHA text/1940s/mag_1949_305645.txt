Meek little Mitsuo Handa had never wanted to make a million yen or be a conquering hero . In his home town of Maebashi , a crumbling provincial capital near Tokyo , Handa spent just enough time at his little bicycle shop to keep his wife and two children in rice and modest clothes ; the rest of his time he fribbled away in an aimless search for a milder spiritual refuge than the stern Shintoism of his ancestors . <P> One day this summer , balding , 63-year-old Handa decided that his search was over . On the telephone poles in Maebashi 's dusty streets appeared placards advertising Warau Kamisama , the Laughing God . Said Handa : " I was fascinated . I have always felt that man is most human when he has a smile on his face . " <P> The Meeting . Handa engineered a meeting with the founder of the new religion , moonfaced Zenjiro Nagumo , a sleek , smooth-tongued evangelist who spiced his exhortations with crisp English phrases , Mohammedan aphorisms and quotations from the Buddhist sutras . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after my own heart . He has faith . " <P> Handa 's fellow townsmen were impressed , too . By last month , converts from the surrounding countryside were streaming into the rickety , broken-down hut which Nagumo used as his headquarters , to be comforted by Nagumo 's deity , " The August Inside of Heaven Owner God . " To demonstrate their true faith , the converts always laughed when they prayed . " The spirit of the smile , " glowed Nagumo , " must linger in everything we do . " <P> Nagumo needed more impressive surroundings if the merry conversions were to continue . Said he to Shopkeeper Handa : " A truly religious person is ready to sacrifice his all to save other people 's souls . Under the circumstances , it would be most noble on your part to sell your best clothing . Thus we shall be able to buy an altar . " <P> The Parting . Mrs. Handa , a weary , practical housewife , objected shrilly . She was fed up with her husband 's ritualistic drum-beating and flute-playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmoved . He sold the family 's clothes ; in return , the new altar was installed in the Handa household . <P> Soon , however , the happy converts stopped showing up . The Handas heard stories that the great Nagumo had collected large sums of money for altars from other families without delivering the sacred goods . This was too much for Mrs. Handa ; her husband reluctantly agreed to drop the new religion . <P> Last week Handa sat mournfully beside the altar , in his underwear ( he was going easy on the few clothes he had left ) . The rickety shack where the great Nagumo had bowed to the Laughing God was bare and deserted . Few of his former disciples were in a laughing mood .
