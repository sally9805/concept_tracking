The U.S. is to have a new No. 1 man-and perhaps a new policy-in troubled Italy . Colonel James Henderson Douglas Jr. , 46 , a Chicago lawyer and businessman now serving in the Air Transport Command , has agreed to resign from the Army Air Forces early this month and join the Allied Commission in Rome . <P> Tall , dark-haired Colonel Douglas will replace white-haired Rear Admiral Ellery Wheeler Stone , also a former businessman ( Postal Telegraph ) , as U.S. member of the Commission . No reflection on Admiral Stone , the change is part of the transition from military to civil supervision of Italy , which has its own national government but is still treated as a defeated and partly occupied enemy country . Douglas will drop his Army title , serve as a civilian commissioner . <P> Douglas is an lowan ( Cedar Rapids ) , an alumnus of Princeton , Cambridge University , Harvard Law School , and a onetime Assistant Secretary of the Treasury ( 1932-33 ) . A Republican , he got out of the Treasury soon after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tenure , the main object of Allied rule in Italy was to make the country tenable for Allied armies . Now the troops are clearing out , and Commissioner Douglas ' job will be political and economic . Before he took it on , he sought assurances that he would have a positive , clear-cut U.S. policy to apply in Italy . The lack of such a policy in the past hamstrung Admiral Stone , gave Italians a poor opinion of western democracy , and made occupied Italy practically a British fief . <P> Able , forthright James Douglas would not have taken the job unless he expected the U.S. to play a stronger , more intelligent hand in Italy .
