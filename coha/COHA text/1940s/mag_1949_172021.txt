Psychiatrists probing into the mysterious workings of the human mind discussed some bright new theories last week : <P> Hint from Histamine . Histamine , a natural body chemical , has long been a medical whipping boy , blamed by some for allergies , stomach ulcers and migraine headaches . For 35 years psychiatrists have wondered about its role in mental disorders . They had one puzzling clue : people with psychoses had fewer allergies . Four years ago , three Manhattan brother-psychiatrists , Drs . Arthur , Mortimer and Raymond Sackler , began treating patients with histamine . Last year they were joined by Dr. Johan van Ophuijsen , 67 , pioneer Dutch Freudian who has been in the U.S. since 1935 . <P> Last week , to a specially called staff meeting at Long Island 's Creedmoor State Hospital , they gave a cautiously optimistic report on their work . They had given injections of histamine to 38 disturbed patients . Ten ( about 26% ) improved ; five of the ten improved enough to leave the hospital . The results were about the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous electric shock treatment . The doctors also found that patients who were first given histamine reacted better when given electric shock . In another series of treatments on 48 office patients with histamine alone , eleven showed slight improvement and 17 " moderate to marked " improvement . <P> The theory behind the treatment , say the Drs . Sackler , is that histamine may give the brain a better blood supply by dilating the blood vessels . Electric shock , they think , works by increasing the amount of histamine . One advantage of the new treatment : the patient need not go to a hospital . The novel histamine report , Dr. van Ophuijsen suspected , would raise a " healthy storm . " <P> No Raised Voices . In trying to find out why children become mentally ill , psychiatrists often cast a disapproving Freudian eye on parents . Johns Hopkins Psychiatrist Trude Tietze studied 25 mothers of schizophrenic patients . The mothers of schizophrenics , she reported in Psychiatry , are apt to be " subtly dominating . " They never raise their voices to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude , or by having a timely sick headache or fainting spell . The children thus have no chance for open rebellion . <P> Only six of the 25 children she studied ever let off emotional steam through the safety valve of temper tantrum . They were " good children " who bottled up their emotions , cracked up later when they were about to finish school and face the world . Vienna-trained Dr. Tietze did not live to see her report published ; on May 7 , she died , at 39 , from cancer .
