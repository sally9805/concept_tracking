THE RED DRESS A Story SYLVIA SHIRLEY y ou will see how everything happens for the best , the moment I have explained it . My sisters and I had already established ourselves in America , our married brother having sent for us seventeen years ago . Papa was to have come , too , but while we waited in Constantinople for our papers he fell in love with an Armenian-Turk , or perhaps the other way around . There are strange people in Constantinople . He married her , leaving us to go on alone . That is a father for you . I ask you , would a mother do like that ? Still , men will be men ; the less said the better . Ariana was the eldest , an old maid even then , that is to say : she was too clever , too critical , and she had our Papa 's nose . Then there was I , who am Luba , and if I have to say so myself , very attractive . I kept house while Ariana worked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the youngest , but not too sensible , if a little prettier than I. When Papa died , and then his wife , their daughter Manya ( already sixteen years old ) wrote that she had been left quite independent and would never leave Constantinople , because it was the most beautiful place in the world . That was n't how we remembered it , but maybe it 's different now . Of course , the men were very handsome and appreciative . You can not say less than that . Even the water vendor with his lousy beard used to kiss his fingers to us and say , which I translatefor you to mean , " Ach , beautiful Russian girls ! Like sweet cream , " and smack his lips . Manya wrote that she scrubbed floors by day and walked in the bazaar in the evening and that she was quite happy and would we please send her a red dress , not that she needed anything , but after all we were related by blood . We saw red , as it is said here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither could we deny his blood and she was after all a sister to us , even if her mother was a foreigner . Of course , we did not believe all of the letter . The part about scrubbing floors seemed a little far-fetched , nor were we much mistaken , as it soon became clear . However , we pooled our resources , that is to say : Ariana and Sophie did , because they were working and I was little mother , so to speak . But it was not enough . So we went to our married brother and enlisted his assistance , if a little grudging , and sent for Manya , which may have been what she intended we should do . She hobbled off the boat to us in a long black gown and high-heeled slippers , a tired-looking woman-of-the-old-world creature . Her eyes were long and heavy-lidded . She looked at each of us fully , just once , and said , " What ugly place . Take me at once to hotel . " Our brother began to mutter , but Ariana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Sophie , who is not too smart , said we better take taxi home . Cabs were a little extravagant for us , but this was an occasion , if a little bewildering . Also , people were staring , so my brother said all right he would pay . But you could see he wished Papa had had sons instead of maidon daughters . We were not growing younger , after all , and probably our brother was afraid that now he would become involved with us more than ever . Though we all adored him , he had an American wife and it was a strain . So we did not go often to his house . We are vivacious with much laughter and sometimes tears , and she serves tea with milk . She came once to us and I am marvelous cook , though I do not like to say so often , and she fished out the small pieces of onion in her plate , one course after another . Well , Manya was left to my charge . I scalded her thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for bathing , and I was surprised to find that her eyelashes were not false or mascara . Her hands were not work-worn , her appetite was good , even too much ; which is always gratifying to the one who cooks as is indication of good health . She never spoke of what had been in Constantinople and we were much mystified and disappointed . Once I took courage and asked her questions ; gently , you understand , not prying , just curious ; but without satisfaction . Manya lowered the lids of her long sleepy eyes and said nothing , only a brief sigh , so that I felt quite uneasy . It soon became apparent that our little sister was not scholarly . She was out of her element in the public school , and we despaired of finding a place to suit her temperament . But Sophie came up with a startling contribution . " Send her to private school . " This we decided , and though we had not much money , we did not approach our brother this time . After many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very refined lady who reminded us a little of our brother 's wife , that is to say : her smile was too thin . We left Manya in her care with some misgivings and much relief . I spoke with earnestness to her that night and cautioned her to be good . Our incomecame to us from Ariana , who knelt all day at the feet of rich ladies to pick up hems , let out seams , or take in darts to conceal the defects in their figures ; and from Sophie , whose quick fingers made the alterations indicated by the pins . Each gown sold for more than twice their joint salaries , but we were not bitter . was the housekeeper and thrifty , to make the most of their efforts . They appreciated me , and I tried to indicate to Manya her duty to her good sisters . Manya was silent , but I was used to that and hoped that somehow she had been impressed . She was not really bad-hearted , only a little self-absorbed and somewhat lazy , with a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved like wheels on greased axles . Then one day there was a letter from the school principal : would I please come and have a little talk . I was flattered and felt almost what it must be to be a real mother . So I dressed in my wine-colored silk , which was brought me from the shop , and which by good fortune had been scorched by the presser , but cleverly concealed by my sisters ; because , as you see , I have such a small waist and it is easily taken in . Sophie loaned me her hat with the Paris label snipped from one of the chapeaux in the shop and I felt in fine feather . No one can see what is inside your hat , but it does make a difference in how you hold your head . What is my despair when Miss Pringle , who has so cheerless a face it strikes a chill , said to me , " You must do something about your sister . She has a very disrupting influence on the others . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that Manya looks as though she has just wakened or is about to drop off . I would not admit , aloud , that no matter how neatly we clothed her , she had always that look of untidiness . Then there was the matter of talking  --  only with her hands . " But , " I explained , gesticulating , so that this stiff-boned woman should understand , " we are like that . It is more expressive when you make so with your hands . The meaning of the words is better . " No . Miss Pringle objected . So , all right , it is not refinement . I will remind Manya , I promised . Alas , there were other things , and with much hesitation Miss Pringle explained . When I finally emerged from her office , in spite of the borrowed hat and its borrowed label , I felt much older than it was my custom to look . " Manya , " I said that night , " today I have talked with Miss Pringle . Darling , you must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread with your lunch . " Manya shrugged . " She does not like when I stretch for it . " " You can ask for it , no ? " " Then one would be all the time talking instead of eating . Everything is put out of reach . " " Miss Pringle says now all the girls whistle when they want something . You must not be a bad influence . " " Okay . I bring bread from home , is better ? " " Manytchka , do not joke . " " Who jokes ? One is hungry , one cats . " " True . But do not wave your arms about . " " Aha ! Again is not right . Whatever Manya does is bad . Please God , the Devil take me soon , and you will grieve . " " Manya ! Shocking talk . " We were getting nowhere . " You must not ask the other girls if they are virgins . " " Why not ? " " It is assumed that unmarried girls are always virgins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated and said as an experiment , " You would not like it if one were to ask you such a question . " She looked at me , her eyes sliding to the corners like slippery fish , and then she closed them , so that the back of my neck was like an ant hill . " People judge you by your behavior . You must learn to have good manners , " I said firmly , though at the moment it would have given me pleasure to cut her head from her shoulders . " Why ? " asked Manya , scratching her head . " Because when you are courteous it pleases other people . " " Ha ! That is weakness , to want always to please others . You please yourself first , then you are happy . You are happy ; you give pleasure . " I had never heard so much talk from her before ; nor could I feel altogether displeased , because there was merit in what she said . But I had promised Miss Pringle to speak to Manya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do less . Soon we had a letter regretting that the enrollment for the following year was already filled . We understood what was meant . Maybe it would have been wiser to have sent the red dress to Constantinople in the first place . " Well , we can not take her to work with us , " my sisters said and looked at me . All right , she would stay at home . MHIS suited Manya very well . She slept 1 late and trailed around in her kimono , sampling all the foods before they were fully cooked . If I gave her anything to do , invariably she did it so badly or so slowly that I took it away . It was no use to be irate with Manya , because you could not arouse her to anger or shame , neither was she ever really unpleasant or sullen . Under the circumstances , however , one could be excused for wishing that she had not been born . Wherever Manya went , people , that is to say men , leered . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about alone . You understand , there was no real harm in her . She just had that look . " There 's only one thing left , " said Sophie , when I poured out my grief . " We must get her a good husband . " Ariana and I looked at her , without reminding her that she had not been too successful on her own account . " That 's easier said than done , " said our eldest sister , sighing . " It can be arranged . Sometimes it is even advertised . People are marrying all the time . " I was horrified but interested . " You mean to put it in the papers that we are seeking for our eighteen-year-old sister a husband ? " " If you put it that way , " said Ariana , " we will have to offer a dowry . " " Maybe we 'd be better off letting her try by herself , " Sophie said thoughtfully . I shuddered . " How would you like a sweetheart ? " Ariana asked Manya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Someone to pay your way to the movies and hold your hand , " I added , falling in with them . " Someone to buy you sweets , " said Sophie , insinuatingly . Manya smiled and smiled , her prune-eyes narrowing all the while . " Is all right , " she said , and wiped her nose mercilessly . R ona ' this time , Ariana had pains of such cruelty in her legs that I prevailed upon her to see the doctor . It was Ariana 's opinion that so many years of working on her knees had warped her bones . But the doctor said go pull teeth . Now that is a strangeness we have here , and probably why there is a need for so many dentists . As soon as one 's arm aches , or one 's legs , right away is the remedy , go pull teeth . But Ariana has so little patience with illness or stupidity , whether it be her own or somebody else 's , that we went to seek a dentist . Mrs. Bilbadian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist on our corner . And it was decided that since so many teeth would have to be repaired it would be less expensive to remove all and be fitted for new ones . Ariana. and I were impressed with the dentist , who , we subsequently discovered , lived with an old mother who was anxious to see him married before she died . He was a tremendous man , tall and rounded , with a vocabulary limited to " Open please , wider please , spit out , " and " Rinse please . " I agreed with Ariana that maybe Dr. Ratzhaus would be a good thing for Manya . We wished to marry off our little sister with the least compunctions . Fat men should not be too hard to please , I reasoned , providing you can cook . Perhaps I could teach Manya something of housewifery , or I might sneak over a roast and pastry from time to time . With much cajoling , it was finally arranged that Mrs. Bilbadian give a party , though I did not trust her too much ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipes called for sour cream . You can not be too sure of a woman who falsifies to her own stomach , and so I provided the refreshments . The dentist and his mother were invited . . Except when he ate , Dr. Ratzhaus did not open his mouth . Several times he got up to make his mother comfortable , while she kept up an interminable chatter about what a good wife should be . There was no way to stretch such a frame around Manya . If she was not selfless nor persevering , neither would she martyr herself . We had to hope , therefore , that the dentist would be blinded by Manya 's physical charm as others , less worthy of acceptance , had been before him . Finally , the old lady said to her son , " Ask her to go for a walk . She is a little too forward , to be sure , but not objectionable . " Manya jumped up at once . " Is beautiful tonight . The moon is shining . " But the dentist sat mute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked his mother . The dentist stiffened himself as if for a tussle with an enemy . He lifted one huge hand and straightened a heavy finger . He pointed . " I want that one , " and then his courage collapsed , for he bent his head into his chest . We stared . Then Manya burst out laughing , and when she laughs , it is something to hear . " See how red she is , " she howled , pointing to Sophie . And she was right . Sophie had misgivings , but Ariana talked her out of them ; that is to say : one can not get a respectable proposal from a dentist every day , mothers-in-law do not live forever , and so on . That is how Sophie got married . Ariana said it was a pity it could not have been arranged sooner , because of the outrageous sum we had to pay for her new teeth . I thought Sophie might intercede and get a reduction on her sister 's behalf , but it is a mistake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still Manya . In the excitement of Sophie 's marriage we overlooked her a little , forgetting to keep a careful watch over her arrivals and departures . It soon became apparent that every time she came into the house , she brought another of God 's creatures , some of them not altogether human in appearance . She was willing to like anyone , regardless of size , age , hair , or lack of same , being rather amiable , but a complete simpleton about men . Manya had that look , you see , only it meant nothing . One autumn we went to a charity picnic-bazaar , that is to say : one paid for a ticket in the first place and then , if one wanted to eat , one bought from the food vendors at the laden tables . Also there were books , and shawls , and trinkets  --  all trash  --  to buy . There was a man who tootled on a horn and another set the pace on an accordion . Also there was a woman to sing , who might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat chest and deep voice . It was a beautiful day , crisp and smelling of sun-browned leaves . " What charming odors , " said Manya , sniffing with a terrifying loudness . At hand a woman was ladling stew into a brown bowl . " Look , goulash , what I love , " Manya pointed . " Not now , " said Ariana , tightening her hold on her purse . " Permit me , " said a hesitant voice behind us ; and there was a little man , whose upper teeth overlapped a little . He had a startled look , as though he were surprised at his own daring , and I liked him right away . He looked at us , one-two-three , and then again , and before we spoke he ordered four bowls , handing them to us in turn . We thanked him . When he saw how Ariana stared , he tried to close his mouth over his teeth . His chin puckered from the strain , and he blushed . He led us to a table , put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for some hot rolls . When he came back , he sat down quickly , straightening his sleeves , and smiled at us . Manya dipped her bread into the gravy and filled her mouth . She was blissful . " Please be my guests , " he said . " I do n't know anybody here . I live in New Jersey and read in the Hungarian paper about the picnic . One gets hungry for the sound of the mother-tongue . " " We are not Hungarians , " said Ariana , with hauteur . " Yoy , " said the little man and he looked at us , one-two-three . There are those who are always surprised to find that there are human beings in other nationalities . " They do n't like Hungarians , " said Manya , sucking the drippings off her fingers . " Is nothing personal , is only themselves they admire . " Her voice was earnest and good-humored , and we did not think to take offense . " What else is to eat ? " she asked looking around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , jumping up . " Wait , " said Ariana . " We are not acquainted . " " She means , do you need a wife and is there money in bank , " Manya said kindly , as if to translate us to him . " Well , I 'm not married , " he answered carefully , " and I have good business . I am cabinet maker , specialist in ice-chests . My father was coffin-maker in old country . My grandfather .. . . " " What is your name ? " interrupted Ariana , and I guessed she was sufficiently impressed . H is name was Milo Niemcy and we let Manya walk with him . We followed , but discreetly . They bought meat and green peppers roasted on skewers , and there was something new in the look on Manya 's face as she watched at the open fire . It was my opinion that the scene called up something of her life in Constantinople , of which she had never spoken . But Ariana raised her eyebrows at me and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything I think to Ariana . It is disheartening to be always pooh-poohed . Later , we saw Mr. Niemcy offering Manya his handkerchief . And suddenly I wanted to cry . I was just beginning to realize that from now on life would be different , that is to say : if Manya married , I would have to live alone with Ariana , who was daily more cranky . Do not misunderstand . I love her very dearly , but she is a little wearing . When it was time to leave the picnic grounds , Mr. Niemcy brought our Manya to us . " I hope you have not been too extravagant , " I said . " Mr. Niemcy will think you are a spendthrift . " But he laughed and so did Manya . " It 's all in the echo-nomics of it , " he explained . " She spends so much only because it is not her own . " He turned to her , as though they had settled it between them , " When it will be yours , you 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks . But Manya said , " Will it be mine ? When will it ? I like something of my own , once . " She was almost wistful and I was heartily ashamed of her . He could think we had starved her , or sent her naked abroad . He brought us all home in his little car , an unlooked-for treat . After that , he came every Sunday for three months . I tried hard to see Manya through his eyes . He was such a nice man I wondered if it was quite fair to him to let him have Manya . But to him she seemed as rich as the dark and fruitful earth of Hungary , and at the same time , exotic and simple , glamorous and naive . Everything went well and they were married at Christmas . Before they were to leave , however , Manya had hysterics . She cried and cried . She would not leave us , how could she go away to live with this strange man who was nothing to her , not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till she wiped her eyes and nose on the chintz skirt of the dressing table , kissed us all several times , and left . A YEAR and a half went by and we did not see her again . Ariana said leave well enough alone , and I did not like to ask her for the fare . You may not believe this , but I missed Manya sorely . When she wrote once or twice , the paper was so messy with ink and grease stains , it was impossible to decipher . Ariana was ill a great deal of the time and worried what would become of us if she would lose her job . Nothing I did or said pleased her . With us it was like with the dog who kept biting the end of his own tail . Then , one summer , the establishment for which Ariana worked closed for alterations . Because she was the oldest employee , she was granted a month 's pay and vacation expenses . For two vacations there was not enough money . Although Ariana offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be together , I denied myself thispleasure . It was decided at last that I would travel up with her and spend the first weekend there and come back for her the last weekend . I took the local train home and sat back to enjoy myself . For me it was an adventure . My thoughts turned to Manya , as they often did , because I could not help but speculate on how it was with her . One thought leading to another , I recalled the day at the picnic and how Manya had cried out , " When will it be my time to have something of my own ? " And I wondered pleasantly if that time ever came to anyone , and if it were ever to come to me , what was it I would like . And it seemed that this was it ? just to sit quietly and watch the farm-land and the towns drift by . Perhaps I dozed . Suddenly , I heard the conductor call " Stockwoode , next . " Stockwoode ! That was where Manya and Milo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it had been express . I would go sec them . I grasped my reticule tightly and reached for my little bag ; and there I was , standing on the platform . Without too much inquiry , I found their house , stopping first at a confectioner 's . It was neat and ugly like all the rest , painted tan with brown trimmings . When I opened the gate my heart began to drum so loudly and so quickly that I had to stand still , breathing deeply for some minutes . My heart does that often lately and I must remember to ask about it some time . It was Manya who answered my knock , and she stared at me for a long time . " Manytchka , " I said , " you are just like always . " But it was not so . She was much thinner and seemed taller . Her heavy hair was brushed back into a roll , and her red dress was clean and pressed  --  only the Lop button was missing at the throat , and another was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Nobody had said my name like that since I was little . " So it is you at last ! Come your way in . You look so tired . " Her voice seemed charming to me as she took my hand and led me inside . " Have you come all by yourself ? " " Yes , " and then we laughed together . " / have brought sweets , " I said , as she took me into her living-room . It was clean and comfortable , and disappointing . There was a piano . The curtains were plain , with many pictures on the walls ; but no rugs , only linoleums . " Where is your husband ? " I asked , as she undid my parcel and laid the cakes on a plate . " Sunday is his day of reckoning , " she answered . I was startled . " How do you mean ? " " He sits in his shop at the end of the garden and reckons his receipts and bills for the week . Then he gives me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That is good . Money is excellent to have , " I said . She put the kettle on and broke a cake in two , giving me the larger piece . Manya was different . " True . Always he talks about how much there is , and how much more there would be if we do not have to pay taxes . " " What do you do with it all ? " " Spend only for what is necessary , pay taxes , and keep the rest in bank . Some is in my name . " She smiled at me in the old way , just as she used to when I set food before her . " You arc happy ? " I asked her . " Sure , look . Whole house is mine . " She led me through the tidy , barren rooms , one after another , and then into the basement to show off her washing-machine . Outside , behind the lumber shack , there was a chicken yard , and on the other side , the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already there , and I could see he wondered what brought me . Supper was a casserole of macaroni and vegetables with bits of meat . Also good warm cabbage soup . I asked if I might have a single boiled egg , my digestion is not what it used to be , and Manya brought in a half-dozen . " From our own chickens . For you I give the heaviest . " When I took sugar for tea , they watched me so closely . my hand trembled so that I took less than intended . Then Manya said , " Is good to see you in my house , no Milo ? " And I was glad to be there , only strange . Afterwards , Milo showed me his shop . it was very neat with a good raw frnell of wood . Over his desk hung a picture of a half-draped female . I was petrified . Whatkind of a portrait was this for a man 's workshop ? " I have more , " he said proudly , following my gaze , and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of picture cards . " This is too much . What for do you need these when you have our Manya ? " I asked . He bent over the pictures and with great care began to erase some thumb-marks . " Yoy , " he sighed . " You do n't know Manya . She is a good wife and has learned the value of a dollar . But she , how shall I say ? I tell you because you are her sister : Manya is not what she seems . She is sparing of everything . " He sighed again and put away his pictures . I stared at him . What was this ? " You must be patient , " I said . " She is very young . " " Perhaps , " he said . But he did not seem convinced . PT  --  HEv did not press me to stay and A1 though I felt that they had been pleased to see me , they seemed just as pleased to see me go . When I got on the train , bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me her shawl . I had no need of it , but I was strongly moved by this gesture , because I had never known her to give of herself before , in any shape or manner . Of course , the fortunes of Manya and Milo would not suffer by this gift since it was so faded and , as to be expected , badly mended . Quickly , I folded it out of sight , feeling tired and lonely and a little like the day I walked out of Miss Pringle 's Day School for Girls , years ago . But I was glad that we had been unstinting in our efforts for Manya . She looked happy . But then she always had that look . As for Milo , what can you expect from a man ? It was not in me to begrudge Manya the fruits of our labor , but something was unequal here . Often there arises a predicament , even a catastrophe , and there is an axiom to prove its value . But here was strangeness , a proverb in reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had persevered , Manya had strained neither brain nor back . Yet she had maneuvered to please herself , above all , in spite of our efforts to teach her to think of others first . Now she had a whole house to play with , money , and even a husband to manage ! I resolved not to speak of this to anyone , but the old habit of talking things over was strong . So next day , I went to visit with Sophie , the dentist 's wife . While watching her bathe the fat little twins , I told her what I had learned about Manya and asked her what she thought , for I was a little confused and not at ease . But Sophie , perhaps because she was not listening too carefully , and perhaps because she never was too sensible , handedme one slippery baby to wrap in a towel and said , " Poor Milo , how was he to know that all that Manya ever wanted was a red dress ? " I did not understand what she was talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would hesitate to say this to Ariana , nor do I like to set myself up as a philosopher ; but the longer I live , the less certain I am that I understand men ; and some women are peculiar , too . And you can see for yourself , how everything has a proper purpose and similar result , only one must shape it a little , as Manya had , without seeming to . The FFV ; Or , .
