Detroit , which wears its motormaking prowess lightly , glows with pride over its culture . Last week Detroit 's culture got a nod of recognition from hypercritical Manhattan , whose opinion is sought , revered and feared by all U.S. musicians . <P> The 110-piece Detroit Symphony Orchestra , fondly referred to as the nation 's biggest and " one of the world 's greatest , " scored a triumph in Carnegie Hall . It was no surprise to Detroiters , who had 80% subscribed and capacity - filled their 5,000-seat Masonic Temple all last season . The once-famed organization which almost died from malnutrition two years ago was fast playing itself back into the black . <P> The happiest observer of this cultural-financial comeback was one of the country 's whitest-robed musical angels : chubby , mild-mannered Henry H. Reichhold ( TIME , Dec. 18 ) , underwriter of the Detroit Symphony 's resurgence . A rich , German born manufacturer ( Reichhold Chemicals Inc. ) who has fiddled as a hobby , Angel Reichhold , 43 , could now sit with more than usual pride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a Manhattan-approved artistic success . <P> Already this season Carnegie Hall had passed judgment on visiting orchestras from Boston , Washington , Indianapolis , Philadelphia . Detroit invaded Manhattan last week with a new technique . From preconcert cocktails to whopping , colorful programs , Henry Reichhold 's Symphony treated Carnegie Hall to a deft , well-planned , super-sales-promotion campaign . <P> To display its virtuosity , the orchestra ig nored the critics , kept a shrewd eye on the cash customers in selecting its program : Rachmaninoff 's Second Symphony , Fernandez ' Batuque , Griffes ' White Peacock , Strauss 's Dance of the Seven Veils . <P> Credit for the suave showmanship went to Conductor Karl Kreuger , 50 , U.S.-born , Vienna-trained , one of the four top native-born maestros in the U.S. ( the others : Leonard Bernstein , Werner Janssen , Alfred Wallenstein ) . Maestro Kreuger had snatched up Detroit 's baton late in 1943 , whipped his 110 players into shape in record time . Carnegie Hall rewarded his energy with a favorable verdict : Detroit 's music is as lush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the postwar family sedan .
