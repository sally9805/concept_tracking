txt AUTO DEALERS GET WARNING OF CRISIS L. C. Cargile of the National Association Sees Threat Outlasting Emergency Representatives of automobile dealers from the twelve States of the Northeastern region were told yesterday by L. C. Cargile , president of the National Automobile Dealers Association , that they face the most serious crisis their business has ever known . Mr. Cargile , who declared that his organization was unwilling to take second place to any other in whole-hearted support of the full national defense program , said at a luncheon meeting at the Hotel Roosevelt that the restrictive proposals of various agencies of goy-eminent extended beyond defense measures , in the opinion of the officers of his association , and seriously threatened the continued existence of the retail automobile business on the basis of free competition . This business , he said , was now carried on by 47,000 dealers in the nation , naving some 450,000 employes . He told 116 large dealers from the New England States , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware and the District of Columbia , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in proposals to restrict output , to curb installment buying and by taxation . All these curbs , he said , were in a state of constant flux , but all were expected to reach proportions far . More serious than even the most pessimistic of his audience might expect . Ready for Sacrifices " We are full in accord with the defense program , " he said . " We are ready to make any sacrifices necessary to preserve the America that our ancestors helped to found and which we have seen develop and grow strong in the course of our business lives . But if some of the proposals which persons of great power in government agencies declare they intend to put into effect are , in fact , carried out , the America which we will have defended will not be the America that we have known . " Mr. Cargile explained that one ofl the most serious threats to the retail automobile industry would come through restriction in materials . Shortages in certain metals , he added , were changing almost from week to week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in production of automobiles than had been anticipated on the basis of definite cuts ' ii quota . The first of such cuts , 20 per cent of this year 's production up to Aug. 1 , was accepted volun- : tarily by the industry at the suggestion of the Office of Production Management . Further reductions on new-model output have been widely anticipated . Mr. Cargile told his hearers , however , that a new phase of output restriction was now on ? , the horizon . In Washington , he said , // AUTO DEALERS GET WARNING OF CRISIS // it was now proposed , even after the defense needs for certain metals and other materials have been met , to allocate such materials to such industries as- government agencies deemed should have them . This plan he declared to be completely contrary to the system of free enterprise under which American industry and business had reached its position of leadership . He also said that the government was thinking in terms of price ceilings on ' manufactured automobiles with controls both of the manufacturers ' price and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the automobile dealer would be put on a subsistence basis and that many dealers ' might not survive . Control of installment-selling of automobiles , as well as other commodities , was now more probable than ever , Mr. Cargile added , with limitations both as to down payment and term of paper likely to be set up to the Federal Reserve Bank . The present recommendation of the House Ways and Means Committee for a 7 per cent excise tax on automobiles , he said , faced a fight against increase on the floor of the House and a still stiffer fight in the Senate . " We will take any tax which may be necessary , " he declared , " in the interest of paying our full share of the defense bill . But we hold firmly to the position that the automobile is not a luxury article but an essential of American life and of defense itself . " Mr. Cargile was introduced by Edward of Pittsburgh , regional vice president of the N. A. D. A. . Clifford M. Bishop , director for metropolitan New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were R. F. Gloster , president of the Automobile Dealers Association of New York , and William Meyer , president of the Brooklyn and Long Island Dealers Association .
