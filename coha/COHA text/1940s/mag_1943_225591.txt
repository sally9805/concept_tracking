On the first day of football practice at Columbia in 1938 , photographers hauled out an old archery target . To get stunt pictures , they placed Quarterback Sid Luckman 25 yd. away and told him to toss passes . Six times in a row he hit the dead center of the four-inch bull's-eye . In seven years of college and pro football he proved that he was just as accurate under gridiron fire . <P> Last week burly Sid Luckman hit his marksmanship top . Before a record crowd of 56,696 in Manhattan 's Polo Grounds , he showed himself the best passer of the year , perhaps the best in football history . As his Chicago Bears gave the New York Giants the worst drubbing ever , 56-to-7 , Sidney Luckman : <P> Threw 30 passes , completed 23 for a total gain of 453 yards . <P> Passed seven times for touchdowns . <P> Both were now alltime National ( professional ) Football League records . <P> Said the New York Times 's William D. Richardson , astonished at this show of virtuosity : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Black-haired , brown-eyed Sid Luckman played his first football in the blare of automobile horns on the hard pavement of Lott Street , Brooklyn . After graduating from Columbia , he signed up with the Bears four years ago . But this week , at 26 , he announced that his career was close to its end : he has signed on as an ensign in the U.S. Maritime Service , expects his call any minute .
