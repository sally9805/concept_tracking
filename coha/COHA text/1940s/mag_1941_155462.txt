Since he appeared on the national scene , five weeks ago , as an advocate of appeasement , Verne Marshall has been sizzling like grease in a hot skillet . While objectors to Mr. Marshall and the press were frying him on all sides , last week someone flipped him from the frying pan into the fire . The flipper : doughty Dr. Leon Milton Birkhead . Dr. Birkhead , who is head of the Friends of Democracy , Inc. , flipped Mr. Marshall with a long-handled telegram . <P> As Mr. Marshall resigned last week as editor of the Cedar Rapids ( Iowa ) Gazette to devote his time to the No Foreign War Committee , the doctor wired : " We now have your organization properly placed . " Its place , the doctor said , was alongside " the salesmen of Social Justice , Christian Mobilizers , Bundists . . . . Your organization is no such bona fide keep-us-out-of-war movement as are the Quakers and similar high-minded and loyal American groups . " Concluded the doctor , brushing his hands off : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee has been exposed before it gathered too much strength . " <P> Dr. Birkhead , who believes that the No Foreign War Committee has the odors of " a very dangerous movement , " has a trained nose for such dangerous odors . Five years ago he returned from a trip to Germany with a list of Nazi sympathizers in the U. S. , supplied him by a boastful Nazi . Dr. Birkhead called on some of the men on the list ( which included Gerald Winrod , the Kansas messiah ; William Dudley Pelley , head of the Fascist Silver Shirts ; Harry Jung of Chicago ; Colonel E. N. Sanctuary of New York ) , heard their arguments , and made up his mind that something nasty was brewing for democracy . He gave up his Unitarian church in Kansas City and started the Friends of Democracy . <P> The warpath is no new path for the fighting doctor . During his 27 years of midwestern ministry he had trodden it often . He fought anti-evolution laws , was present at the Scopes trial . Once he asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up in institutions , were being taken to the edge of town and turned loose . When the mayor challenged the charge , the police commissioners backed up Dr. Birkhead in public . The mayor , infuriated , brought his fist down on the table with a crash , exploded " By God ! " and fell dead . Since then Dr. Birkhead has had to go easier on his opponents . But last week , claiming that there were 15 to 20 million pro-Nazis in the U. S. , and not enough people " howling " for democracy , the good doctor got ready to do some lusty howling .
