The men and women of the " Army of Minute Men " were eager to get started on their rounds and so thousands of them did not wait for the official opening today . They started knock g on doors and in most cases they were welcomed with smiles by the families on their lists . In the tenements and the apartments on the East Side and the West Side the pledge solicitors had little trouble , save when they encountered a householder who was not dressed for callers or who was busy basting or carving the Sunday roast . And They Are Rewarded In many of the homes they were ushered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and graciously . In the apartment houses doormen cooperated by checking through the switchboard to save the pledge solicitors the trouble of knocking on doors where no one was home . At the larger hotels on the East Side Minute Men paid calls to the clerks yesterday , obtaining the names of permanent guests for calls during the week . At some of the large apartments on the East Side they left cards at the doors , naming an hour when they would call during the week . At one hotel , the Pickwick Arms , on Fifty-first Street between Second and Third Avenues , the team of Minute Men found so many of the residents at home because of the weather that they decided to go through and get the pledges . They reported later that their appeals had not been turned down in a single instance . During the drive , 200,000 Minute Men and Women will visit each of the 2,000,000 homes in the city to obtain pledges for the local share of the $12,000,000,000 national war savings quota . Mrs. Kelly , widow of the flier who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the principal figure in a ceremony on the Long Meadow in Prospect Park , where Brooklyn took the lead in sounding off on its borough quota of $760 , - 000,000 . Mrs. Kelly , chairman of the Retail Voluntary Corps in the national drive , reviewed eightyfour gingham-clad salesgirls who " jumped the gun " by selling war stamps among the 2.000 persons who braved glowering skies for the three-hour outdoor ceremony . " I know what 's needed to bring this war to a close  --  but rapidly , " said Mrs. Kelly . " We must bring more and more planes to the boys in the combat zones . We can do this by buying bonds . " Pointing to the corsage of nine cellophane-budded war savings stamps that added color to her black frock , Mrs. Kelly said : " We wear these for duty as well as beauty . I would like to see every American woman wearing such a corsage . " Special Sessions Justice Matthew J. Troy , who presided , said that " cheering , marching and flagwaving " alone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war bonds , he said : " We can lose the war , and if we lose it will be the people at home who lose the war  --  not the men of the Navy , Marines , Air Forces or the Army . " A feature of the ceremony was the induction into the Navy of ten volunteers by Lieutenant William G Morrison . Lucy Monroe , the " Star Spangled Soprano , " sang and awarded a $100 war bond to Edward Cooney , Manual Training High School student , who also won the title of " Brooklyn 's best singer " by his rendition of " My Old Kentucky Home . " In a contest decided by audience applause Cooney was adjudged the winner over Virginia Oswald of Bay Ridge High School and Dan O'Connor of Erasmus Hall High School . Points to Investment Every one knows of the government 's need for money to arm and feed our own forces and our allies , Mr. Schram said . Purchase of war bonds is an excellent investment , too , he said , with every $3 bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another aspect of this finance victory program which needs to be emphasized , " the Stock Exchange head declared . " Our voluntary investment of our money in government bonds is one of the methods by which we can prevent inflation . It is , in a very real sense , insurance against a disastrous elevation of prices . Thus , apart from considerations of patriotism which naturally move all of us so powerfully at this time , we are afforded an opportunity , by means of the regular and convenient investment of our surplus funds , to fortify ourselves financially for the future and at the same time to guard against price dislocations which could easily develop into a national tragedy . " Before giving a tap dancing exhibition , Bill Robinson said : " They say I 'm too old to be in the Army , but I 'm not too old to raise plenty of money for the government . Up to yesterday I have collected close to $8,000,000 . " I want you all to buy war bonds , lots of ' em . But you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harlem , I 'll fix you with money to buy bonds . Tomorrow the number is 482 . " His reference to the policy game drew a ready laugh . Bayard Pope , State chairman of the Treasury Department 's war savings staff , also spoke , and the New York City Symphony Orchestra played . Louis J. Dimitroff , borough chairman , and Major Benjamin Namm , a leader in the drive , were introduced . The exercises were broadcast over WNYC . Mrs. Kelly , in returning the salute of the salesgirls brigade , said : " Thank goodness , I was a Girl Scout here in Brooklyn , in Troop 142 , where I learned to salute . I am always happy to be in Brooklyn . It was my home for a time . My parents reside here and it is still my home whenever I come to this city . " The Minute Men , comprising the largest sales force ever assembled in one area , will ring doorbells nightly between 6 and 9 o'clock until June 24 . John T. Madden , city campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door or mailbox the " Welcome , Minute Man " sticker sent last week in the mail . Mr. Madden said that 10 per cent of the average New Yorker 's income was the goal . The Minute Men will , however , accept even the smallest pledge , he said . Those signing pledges will receive insignia and window stickers . " When the Minute Man calls on you , you face one of the greatest decisions of your life . Consider your answer carefully , " said Mr. Madden . Mayor La Guardia has joined the Minute Men , it was announced , and expects to ask his neighbors , near the Gracie Mansion , to sign war bond pledges . The Mayor will joinl Mr. Madden in ringing the " Freedom Bell " atop the Capitol Theatre at 5 P. M. today for the official start of the campaign . The bell , cast in 1752 simultaneously with the Liberty Bell , has rung on several historic occasions , among them the rallying of patriots in support of John Peter Zenger 's fight for freedom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be replaced in the belfry of St. Paul 's Church , Mount Vernon , as a memorial to Sara Delano Roosevelt . Mr. Madden said that persons already buying bonds , whether under a payroll allotment plan or otherwise , should sign pledges anyway to reaffirm their intentions and should increase the amount if possible .
