txt Tire Rationing Discounted In your Jan. 3 issue appeared a letter , " Tire Rationing Criticized , " which emphasized the basic importance of the automobile in the economic structure of the United States . It also suggests measures for augmenting rubber imports and synthetic rubber production . The soundness of these two points-is evident , and they are admittedly under consideration by our government . The letter , however , implies a doubt as to the soundness of the present restrictions . There is a suggestion that Mr. Henderson might have been impulsive in his classification of vehicles entitled to new tires . It seems to me that those of us who have a tendency to cry out before being hurt have first claim on the term " impulsive . " The months that will pass before the present rationing is seriously felt by the country as a whole will undoubtedly be employed by the government in making any necessary adjustments to the preliminary measure .
