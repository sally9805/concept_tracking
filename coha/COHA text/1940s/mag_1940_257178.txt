Most obvious door to the central mysteries of life is protoplasm , the basic stuff of living cells . An intriguing characteristic of all raw protoplasm is its " streaming " -a flow like watery jelly . For some years Dr. William Seifriz , professor of botany at the University of Pennsylvania , has cultured an exceedingly primitive , golden yellow slime mold called Physarum polycephalum , just about the lowest observable form of life . In its streaming he has clocked a major rhythm of about 45 seconds ( TIME , Dec. 6 , 1937 ) . Rather like a primordial heartbeat , this pulse may be the ancestor of all real heartbeats . <P> Unobtrusively last year into Dr. Seifriz ' laboratory glided a fragile , gracious , 27-year-old Japanese scientist , Noburo Kamiya . This gifted young man had done postgraduate work in botany at Tokyo 's Imperial University , was studying at Giessen in Germany in the fateful summer of 1939 . When Germany invaded Poland , the Japanese Government ordered Kamiya to get out . Not stopping for books or clothing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bergen . He wrote to Dr. Seifriz , asking if he could go to work in his laboratory . Seifriz welcomed him . " First thing I did , " Seifriz recalls , " was to lend him a raincoat . " Kamiya still has it . <P> When Kamiya had seen with his own eyes the rhythmic throb of Physarum , a question leaped into his mind : " What is the horsepower , what is the amount of force involved ? " To find out , he devised a new experiment . To perform it , he takes a little piece of the mold , works it into a sort of dumbbell shape-two blobs connected by a thin strand . He puts this into an air chamber divided into two compartments by a block of agar ( marked C in the diagram ) . The two blobs , a and b , are in separate chambers but are connected by the strand which runs through a small hole in the agar . Protoplasmic streaming from a to b and vice versa can take place through the strand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in A , it can be raised or lowered at will . When the pressure is the same in both compartments , rhythmic streaming occurs normally through the strand . But by raising the air pressure in A , Kamiya can slow down and stop the flow of material from b to a . When the flow has stopped , he has balanced air pressure against the protoplasmic force . Thus , by noting the amount of the increased pressure , he measures the protoplasmic force . <P> Last week he reported in Science that this force reaches an average of almost five ounces per square inch . That is not bad for a slime mold . It is about the same pressure exerted on the bottom of a glass by eight inches of water . <P> When Kamiya plots the rise and fall of the protoplasmic force on a graph , he gets elegant curves . These excite the admiration of Seifriz , who exclaims : " Did you ever see such perfect curves ? Nothing like it has ever been done before . It makes biology an exact science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wave forms and amplitudes of his curves . This he takes to mean that Physarum has not just one rhythm but several rhythms acting together . In other words the life throb of the slime mold is not just a simple drumbeat ; it is an orchestration .
