Under the corporate laws of Georgia , a legal charter was obtained last August by the " benevolent and patriotic society " of Columbians . This disarming front shielded ominous trappings . The members wore Army khaki uniforms and startling insignia-a red thunderbolt . The Columbians also boasted a belligerent creed : " To create voting solidarity among all white American citizens . ... To encourage our people to think in terms of race , nation and faith . " <P> Thus equipped , President Emory Burke , 31-year-old Atlanta draftsman and high-school graduate , began drumming up recruits . Secretary Homer L. Loomis Jr. , 32 , was an avid assistant . A war veteran and socialite son of a wealthy New York lawyer ( " where I learned to hate Jews and Negroes " ) , Loomis moved to Atlanta last winter with the intention of " starting something . " Although the loose-mouthed rantings of Yankee Loomis were hotly denounced by civic-minded Atlantans , he was quickly able to find a following . His formula : " We tell the people what they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Last week organized , khaki-shirted Columbians staged a meeting in a downtown Atlanta hall . While a tinny phonograph blared martial music , Columbians stamped up &; down , looking baleful and clenching raised fists . Secretary Loomis , in a crew haircut , excoriated Jews , Negroes and the " alien element . " President Burke , speaking with an affected English accent , presented a " medal of honor " to 17-year-old James Childers , just released on bail for allegedly blackjacking a Negro . <P> Two days later the Columbians gathered in public again . On Atlanta 's unpaved Garibaldi Street , Frank Jones , a 45-year-old Negro , was moving his family belongings into an unpainted bungalow once tenanted by whites . Columbians met him at the door , pointed to placards warning Negroes away from the neighborhood . <P> <P> Columbian R. L. Whitman had brought along his wife and baby to watch the fun . On the baby 's sleeve was pinned the thunderbolt symbol ( see cut ) . <P> Before the lightning could strike , Atlanta police swooped down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to tell you once and for all ... the Atlanta police department is policing this town . " Four of the leaders , including disgruntled Homer L. Loomis Jr . and Whitman , were hustled off to jail , booked for disorderly conduct and " inciting a riot . " <P> <P> In Detroit 's cosmopolitan Petoskey section , hoodlums last week systematically scarred the windows of 41 kosher butcher shops with acid . Apparently well-organized , the vandals carried specially insulated buckets , drove cars with license plates covered . Police had no clue as to their identity .
