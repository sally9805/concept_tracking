txt The itinerant congressmen who for the past several months have been roaming the byways of the whole world now are beginning to return to Washington in swarms . It already is evident that most of them traveled with open eyes and open minds , and it can be put down at once that they have done themselves and the country a valuable service . Undoubtedly there were congressmen whose GI sons knew more about what was going on in the world than their fathers . They had been there , and seen with their eyes and heard with their ears and felt with their own feelings what was happening . Nov literally scores of senators and representatives have gone to look for themselves , and from the evidence they are bringing back it is clear that they were profoundly impressed with the stake which the United States has in helping Europe to help itself get on its feet . All this is a far cry from the scene in the White House in the fateful year 1939 when President Roosevelt called in the congressional leaders to warn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to support a revision in the neutrality laws . After listening to the President outline the information on which he was basing his conclusion that war was imminent , Senator William E. Borah ( R ) of Idaho replied : " Mr. President , I ca n't agree with you . I have my own sources of information ; I am confident they are reliable and that there will be no war . " As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Senator Borah had neVer in his entire life set foot on the soil of a foreign country . A A A Another conference shortly will take place in the White House as fateful as that fruitless meeting in 1939 . President Truman before long will call in the congressional leaders to warn them how near Europe is to economic collapse and to ask them to aid in averting that collapse . After listening to the President outline the Government 's information or . which he will be basing his conclusion , the Republican and Democratic congressmen will reply : " Mr. President , our information squares with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the quickest and fullest possible aid is right in itself and vital to America 's own welfare and security . " The most encouraging fact in Washington today is that the congressmen returning from their world tours are almost unanimous in their conviction that stopgap and long-range Marshall Plan aid is imperative and that Congress should be quick in authorizing it . Actually , former isolationists are leading the van of the advocates of American financial aid to Europe . Representative Everett Dirksen ( R ) of Illinois could n't wait to get home to make his appeals for early congressional action . Representative Karl Mundt ( R ) of South Dakota . another former isolationist , has been saying the same thing and urging r Harris &; Z* ins The Capitolanew that more funds be made available to the " Voice of America " and other informational agencies . On the week end , Representative Dewey Short ( R ) of Missouri and eight other members of his Joint Armed Services-Appropriations Committee joined in favoring , on the basis of their on-the-spot survey , immediate American aid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has entered dissent . He reported from Europe that he had been unable to see any underfed people . Well , there are lots of things Mr. Taber ca n't see right here in the United States , and his acidulous and capricious dissent would be part only of the minority which helps keep democracies democratic . But it would n't he surprising to see Mr. Taber change his opinion when he gets back home  --  and if not his opinion , at least his vote . A A A Assuming that emergency aid can be found to hold out until January , Congress will then be called on to take two steps : It will be asked to approve an emergency appropriation of $600,000,000 to $800 , - 000,000 in two weeks and to bring the Marshall Plan into being by April 1 . The prospects that Congress will approve both these measures are increasingly favorable . The special Herter committee has yet to make its report : it will be one of the most weighty and respected judgments of all the traveling congressional groups , and there is reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , The itinerant congressmen have done a good job at getting their own facts . Since facts are 90 per cent of good judgment , it looks as though Congress is going to render a good judgment on American aid to Europe .
