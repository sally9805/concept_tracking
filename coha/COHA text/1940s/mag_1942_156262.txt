Last week the pictures arrived , and U.S. citizens could see for themselves how Lieut . General Joseph W. Stilwell , 59 , had looked on his heroic cross-country march from Burma last May . <P> They could see him in old khaki pants and shirt and a battered campaign hat , leading his company of 117 men &; women up a single-file jungle path ( see cut ) . They could see him sitting on a log repairing his tommy-gun with expert fingers-cigaret between his lips , his big American feet dangling awkwardly from skinny shanks , hat tilted back . <P> He did not look like a Napoleonic commander , performing a miracle of military endurance . He was only a plain , lanky , thin-lipped American , with a weather-beaten face , a dour smile , a sunburned neck : he might have been a hunter in the backwoods of his native Florida . But like the plain , lanky Americans who hacked the nation out of the wilderness , " Vinegar Joe " had created an epic-out of sweat and weariness and malaria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing for China ( see p. 37 ) was worth all the noble and encouraging talk in the world . <P> For three weeks General Stilwell had led his little band through Burma 's parched thickets , teakwood forests and steaming jungles , across the Chindwin River , up mountain trails over 7,000-ft . Saijapao Pass and down into India . And it was Uncle Joe , oldest man in the crowd , who always led them . He acted as company commander , mess sergeant , guide , gun bearer , nurse . He kept the company at a dogged , fixed pace of 105 steps a minute ; his men called it " The Stilwell Stride . " <P> The U.S. remembered what he had said when he got his band , all safe , to India : " I claim we got a hell of a beating . We got run out of Burma and it is humiliating as hell . I think we ought to find out what caused it , go back and retake it . " Looking at Uncle Joe 's picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaking Burma and everything else .
