A CORNET is heard . The song is Wonderful One . The curtain rises . OWEN WEBSTER is in the house alone . He is leaning over the table , concentrating on a letter . He lifts it , reads some of it to himself , folds it , puts it back into its envelope , and puts the envelope in a back pocket . OWEN What 's in New York  --  mice ? We got mice right here in the house . ( He takes a penny from his pocket , flips it in the air , slaps it on his hand , and looks at it ) Heads . ( He goes to the piano and starts to play Wonderful One . Soon the cornet is heard again . He stops playing to listen . The cornet fades away . He rests his head on his folded arms , then strikes all the keys of the piano , from left to right . He gets off the stool , stands on it , opens the top of the piano , and examines the strings inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to right , in three different movements . He climbs the piano , stands on it , and reaches up for one particular book on the high shelf . He opens the book , examines it , closes it , and puts it back ) Just a lot of words . ( He comes down from the piano , and walks on the edge of the bay-window . He picks up a copy of the Saturday Evening Post , sits at the table and turns the pages ) ( Singing or chanting softly ) Row , row , row your boatGently down the stream , Merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily , Life is but a dream . ( He stops . His attention is drawn to a particular picture ) Amazing ! Automobile ! ( He tears the page out of the magazine , crumples it , throws it over his head onto the floor ) ( Sings again and turns some more pages ) Gently down the stream . ( Discovers a new picture ) Beautiful ! Airplane ! ( Tears out page , throws it away ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rises ) Elinore , he said , I love you . ( Eloquently ) Literature ! ( Pause ) Oh , Elinore of the Saturday Evening Post , I love you . ( HARMONY BLUEBLOSSOM is seen coming up the hill . She looks around at the view , comes to the house , looks at the number on the house , and slowly enters the room ) I love you , Elinore . Do you hear me ? ( MISS BLUEBLOSSOM watches and listens , fascinated ) I would travel to the far corners of Europe , Asia , Africa and Australia to see your shining face . ( He ends this eloquent recitation with outstretched arms ) p. 3 BLUEBLOSSOM Young man ! ( OWEN jumps and turns ) Who in the world are you talking to ? OWEN Elinore . ( Lowers his arms , embarrassed ) BLUEBLOSSOM Who 's Elinore ? OWEN Nobody . She 's a dame in the Saturday Evening Post . She 's the sweetheart of the nickel magazines . What 's your name ? BLUEBLOSSOM Harmony Blueblossom . OWEN Harmony Blueblossom ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up here on Red Rock Hill . Are you lost ? BLUEBLOSSOM I 'm looking for a man named Jonah . Do you know him ? OWEN Do I know him ? He 's my father . BLUEBLOSSOM ( Looking at him closely ) Your father ? OWEN ( Proudly ) Sure . BLUEBLOSSOM Jonah Webster ? OWEN That 's right . Jonah Webster . ( Very politely ) Please come in . Wo n't you sit down ? p. 4 BLUEBLOSSOM ( At chair ) Is he here ? OWEN He is n't here now , but he 'll be here soon . Please sit down . BLUEBLOSSOM ( Sits ) Thank you . OWEN ( Looking at her ) Blueblossom ! BLUEBLOSSOM Yes . OWEN Wonderful ! My father sure is a killer . If you 're this pretty now , boy , what you must have been back there in the good old days before I was born ! BLUEBLOSSOM When was that ? OWEN Oh , I have n't been around long  --  fifteen years . ( Proudly ) I 'm a failure . BLUEBLOSSOM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . OWEN It 's the truth . No education , no social contacts , no political affiliations . I just loaf . ( Looking at the knitting ) What is all that stuff ? BLUEBLOSSOM Knitting . OWEN ( After watching her knit a moment ) Is that good ? p. 5 BLUEBLOSSOM Perfectly harmless . Surely think . I do a lot of thinking for a punk my age . BLUEBLOSSOM Punk ? OWEN Yeah . Loafer . Good-for-nothing . I have n't done a day 's work in my life . I 'm opposed to work . Are n't you ? BLUEBLOSSOM ( Knitting faster ) No . I believe I 'm in favor of work . OWEN Well , that 's all right  --  but I 'm opposed to it . BLUEBLOSSOM If nobody worked , I have heard that civilization would  --  ( Scarcely daring to say the fearful word )  --  collapse ! OWEN ( Leans against the table ) Ah , that 's a lot of jitney propaganda . BLUEBLOSSOM I read it in The Reader 's Digest . OWEN Who wrote it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is , he 's a dreamer . BLUEBLOSSOM What do you mean ? p. 6 OWEN I mean that collapse stuff is a lot of hooey . Anything that collapses  --  for any reason  --  deserves to . If nobody worked , nothing would collapse . Everybody would look around , take it easy , find out what they want to do , and then do it . Then it would n't be work , it would be living , which is what we 're supposed to be doing around here , I guess . BLUEBLOSSOM Yes . I believe we are supposed to be living . OWEN All right . ( From porch ) On a day like this  --  a beautiful summer day  --  any man who works  --  well , I feel sorry for him . He 's not living . He 's doing things he does n't want to do . He 's thinking about things he does n't want to think about ; worrying ; losing his mind all the time . ( Angry ) A life has a right , has n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Are you a Communist ? OWEN Hell , no . They 're no different from the Republicans , and the Republicans are no different from the Democrats . That 's all politics . I do n't believe in little rights and little freedoms . Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly . Who 've they got to talk to or assemble with ? I believe in freedom of freedom . Communist ? I 'm a poet . p. 7 BLUEBLOSSOM ( Challenged ) Well , you eat . OWEN Oh , sure . I love food . Do n't you ? But I fast , too , you know . BLUEBLOSSOM You do ? Are you a Catholic ? OWEN No , no  --  just a poet . BLUEBLOSSOM Then why do you fast ? OWEN Why ? Because there 's no food . ( He looks around the room , then disappears in the hallway ) BLUEBLOSSOM What in the world are you looking for ? OWEN ( Sticking his head out ) A mousetrap . BLUEBLOSSOM What ? OWEN ( Sticking his head out again ) A mousetrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mousetrap ? OWEN ( Holding mousetrap ) Interesting , is n't it ? Here , I 'll show you how it works . ( Sets trap and places it at the center of the room right in front of her ) How 'd you like to be a mouse and get caught in something like this ? ( Snaps the trap with a piece of rolled paper ) p. 8 BLUEBLOSSOM ( Startled ) I beg your pardon ? OWEN I mean , it would be quite a surprise , would n't it ? ( Showing her the trap ) One would feel very foolish . ( Rises ) My sister is always burning the traps because she 's so afraid one of us is going to be cruel to something else alive . ( Sets trap again ) That 's why I 've got to hide them . You 've got no right , she says . Owen Webster , you 've got no right . ( Looking for a place to put the trap ) BLUEBLOSSOM Over in the corner . Over in the corner , boy  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap at center of room ) No  --  I 've tried the corners . They do n't fall for the traps there . BLUEBLOSSOM No mouse is going to fool with a trap at the center of a room . And where 's the cheese ? OWEN Cheese in traps does n't fool our mice . They want cheese where it belongs  --  in the pantry , and traps where they belong  --  out in the open , where they can study them . They just study the traps . They do n't crowd into them . BLUEBLOSSOM I have never heard of such mice . ( Pause ) And where has your father gone ? p. 9 OWEN Nowhere in particular . He likes to stand on a street corner now and then and talk to the people . BLUEBLOSSOM What does he talk about ? OWEN ( Kneeling on the chair ) Do n't you know my father ? BLUEBLOSSOM Not lately . You look a good deal like Jonah when I saw him last . I do n't understand his talking on street corners . OWEN Well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trap , smiling ) One of them will come out and look at the trap . BLUEBLOSSOM I do n't know why a mouse would want to look at a trap . OWEN They 're suspicious . They 've been trained not to be fearful , but I suppose they 'll always be suspicious . BLUEBLOSSOM Who in the world trained them ? OWEN My sister ! St. Agnes of the Mice , we call her . I believe the mice worship her . BLUEBLOSSOM Worship her ? OWEN You do n't often hear of mice bringing people flowers , do you ? BLUEBLOSSOM Young man ! p. 10 OWEN Yeah . And last Christmas when my sister had the flu the mice got together in this room  --  over by the stairs there  --  and prayed for her . And St. Agnes got well without so much as taking an aspirin . BLUEBLOSSOM I have never heard of anything so interesting . OWEN Yeah . My sister says we must love them , but I think they should at least see a trap occasionally . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely sure , however . Perhaps it would be best not to hurt their feelings , since they bring her flowers . ( Pause ) What sort of flowers ? OWEN Little flowers . On her birthday the flowers had been arranged to spell Agnes . It was the sweetest sight the human eye ever saw . They ask very little , take care of their own sick , and pray for the best . It 's simply a question of who lives here  --  the mice or us ? BLUEBLOSSOM ( With affection ) I would so like to see Jonah again . OWEN You ought to see him . He 's a failure , too . BLUEBLOSSOM Not Jonah . ( Pause ) And what do you want to be when you grow up ? p. 11 OWEN Nothing . I 'm a writer . BLUEBLOSSOM A writer ? How wonderful . OWEN Yeah . I look at things carefully . I 'm going to turn every-thing upside down , inside out , all the way around , and make it better  --  well , less worst . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sister  --  of the mice  --  what does she do ? OWEN She fights off boys and men . She 's very pretty , and every man who sees her thinks she 's the girl he 's been waiting for all his life . BLUEBLOSSOM Is she that pretty ? OWEN Oh yeah . I 'll bet she 's just as pretty as you were when you were a little girl . She rambles around all over the city , fighting ' em off all day . There 's not a man in the lot , she says . BLUEBLOSSOM How strange . There used to be . OWEN Not any more . To look at her you would n't think a little girl like that would pack such a mean wallop . BLUEBLOSSOM Surely one of them must be worthy of more than a wallop . OWEN Not one . There is n't a man in the whole kit and kaboodle , she says . She expects a lot of human beings  --  especially men . They 've been here long enough , she says . She wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long they 've been here and what a responsibility it is . There 's no excuse for it , she says . p. 12 BLUEBLOSSOM No excuse for what ? OWEN For being the way they are  --  weak and foolish and fearful . BLUEBLOSSOM What a strange young girl . OWEN Yeah . The mice worship her . They spell her name with flowers . I suppose an undertaking like that calls for every hand . BLUEBLOSSOM Are there several of them ? OWEN Several ? There must be a thousand , at least . BLUEBLOSSOM A thousand mice in one house ! OWEN Yeah . No rats , mind you  --  just little mice . Of course a house is a pretty big proposition , and a house like this  --  well , the good Lord knows there 's room enough . My sister says there 's room enough anywhere for a little human kindness . There are certain behind-the-scene corners and areas and spaces that we could never live in  --  well , that 's where they live . BLUEBLOSSOM And Jonah 's other children  --  who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady ) Have n't you got any children ? BLUEBLOSSOM No , I haven't. p. 13 OWEN My father 's got three . Me , my sister , and my brother Harold . ( Pause ) Only he 's in New York . BLUEBLOSSOM New York ! OWEN Yeah . New York , New York . Do you know how many miles away New York is ? BLUEBLOSSOM No , I do n't believe I do . OWEN ( Dramatically ) Three thousand three hundred and thirty-three miles . BLUEBLOSSOM What 's he doing there ? OWEN Search me . He 's nineteen years old , though . He 's got a mind of his own . He 's got a cornet , too . ( He stands back , listening , and again the cornet is heard from far away ) BLUEBLOSSOM What are you listening to , young man ? OWEN My brother . Harold . Playing the cornet . BLUEBLOSSOM Do you mean to say you can hear him now ? OWEN Perfectly . Three thousand three hundred and thirty-three miles is a long way , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornet some place in New York . BLUEBLOSSOM Oh , tush , tush , young man ! p. 14 OWEN Tush , tush ? Honest I can hear him . Right here in this room , I used to play the piano and he used to sit over there in that chair and play the cornet . You know , you do n't miss a fellow much until he goes to New York . That 's the city that makes you miss people more and more . ( The solo ends ) BLUEBLOSSOM Is it ? OWEN Oh , yeah . That 's some city . BLUEBLOSSOM Have you ever been there ? OWEN Only in my sleep . The other night I was there and I saw him standing on a corner . I went up to him and I said , Come on home . And do you know what he said ? BLUEBLOSSOM No , I do n't . OWEN He said , I 've got to make my fame and fortune first . I 've got to make a million dollars . BLUEBLOSSOM A million ? OWEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what would he want with a million dollars ? OWEN ( Comes forward ) I 'm glad you asked me that , because that 's exactly what I asked him , and do you know what he said ? p. 15 BLUEBLOSSOM I 'm not sure . OWEN Well , he said he wanted a million dollars to throw away . BLUEBLOSSOM Throw away ? OWEN That 's right . Put it in a big truck , drive around town and throw it away . The stuff 's no good , he said  --  throw it away ! ( HARMONY looks at the boy , trying to figure him out , as the boy throws the money away ) BLUEBLOSSOM Of course it was a dream . OWEN Sure . But it 's true , too . BLUEBLOSSOM You 're fifteen , your brother in New York is nineteen , and how old is your sister  --  St. Agnes of the Mice ? OWEN She 's seventeen . You ought to see her . You ought to see my brother in New York , too . I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll read it anyway . ( Pause , solemnly ) Here 's what he says . ( Sits on table ) Dear Shakespeare . He 's always kidding me about being a writer , you see . Shakespeare , Byron , Keats , Shelley , Burns , Milton  --  and sometimes just to get me sore he calls me Longfellow . BLUEBLOSSOM You do n't like being called Longfellow ? p. 16 OWEN Who would ? He wrote Hiawatha , did n't he ? ( Chanting ) On the ocean 's shining surface , On the wide-extending billows , From the dark sea rose a hero , Rose a hero from the sea-swell . And so on and so on for years and years . BLUEBLOSSOM I rather like Hiawatha , young man . OWEN Well , if you like it , that 's different . But he calls me Long-fellow when he wants to get me sore . I 'm a poet , not a sewing-machine . BLUEBLOSSOM What does your brother say in the letter ? OWEN Dear Shakespeare , he says . This is the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . It sure feels different , not knowing anybody . I miss you , and Saint , and Father , and Dan , and Father Hogan  --  and the mice , too . I play the cornet every chance I get . I feel fine . Do n't worry about me because everything is fine , but when the next pension check comes please send me two or three dollars  --  general delivery . I do n't need it , but send it anyway , just in case . So long . Harold . ( Pause ) He 's been in New York nine months . You know , that 's a long time . This is the last letter we got from him . To tell you the truth , we 're all worried , but we act like we 're not . My father worries most . Well , maybe Saint does . I 'm not sure . p. 17 BLUEBLOSSOM Why did he go to New York ? OWEN I guess because 's he 's nineteen  --  I do n't know . ( He turns his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look at the trap . BLUEBLOSSOM Do n't you suppose they 'd be a little timid about coming out  --  with so much talking going on ? OWEN I do n't know why they should . ( Pause ) Maybe if we sit quietly for a moment  --  and wait ? BLUEBLOSSOM Perhaps it might encourage one of them . OWEN O.K. ( Sits on floor . They sit quietly , smiling at one another . They look at the trap , around the room , into corners , and everywhere . The old lady lifts her feet off the floor ) ( Whispering ) Are you fond of mice ? BLUEBLOSSOM ( Softly ) Not particularly . Are you ? OWEN ( Softly ) Only insofar as they reveal still further the magnificence of Almighty God . There 's a thousand of them at least  --  somewhere in the wood . ( Aloud ) No rats , mind you , just little mice . Give them a chance , my sister says . If God gave them a chance , we 've got to give them a chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . OWEN That 's the way my sister looks at it , and the mice are grateful too . ( Rises ) They go all over , looking for things for her . BLUEBLOSSOM I do n't believe it . OWEN It 's the truth . The whole thing is practically a small religion . There 's a heart beating in those little animals . ( Sits on table , folding his legs ) Only last week , as I got on the Number Seventeen Street Car , I saw one of them sitting on the cow-catcher . BLUEBLOSSOM Incredible . Are you sure it was one of your mice ? OWEN Positive . We exchanged glances . BLUEBLOSSOM Where was the mouse going ? OWEN ( Gets off the table ) I do n't know for sure , but when I got off at Third and Market , the mouse was still there , sitting on the cow-catcher . We exchanged glances again . I suppose it went down to the waterfront , to one of the boats down there . BLUEBLOSSOM The boats ! I understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases imaginable . p. 19 OWEN A cold , maybe . BLUEBLOSSOM No  --  dreadful diseases . Malaria , bubonic plague , yellow fever , leprosy , and all sorts of other horrible diseases . OWEN Not these mice . They do n't pick up anything that is n't worth while . BLUEBLOSSOM And where did you go ? OWEN ( Quickly , sporty-like ) I dropped in at a gambling joint I visit once in a while . I bet the horses whenever it appears to be the smart thing to do . Well , I went into Joe 's and bet fifty cents on the nose of a two-year-old named Tree  --  because that 's also the name of a book I have written  --  but she got a bad decision in a photo-finish . It was a six-furlong sprint and the jockey knew both his race and his mount . Jockey Infante . He held her back until the far turn ; eased her gently into contention ; went to the rail ; turned her loose , and began to shout . He did n't use the whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to third , from third to second , and then you could really see her heart . In fifteen seconds she closed seven lengths . I knew I had the right horse . Tree . ( Pause ) It was a photo-finish , but they gave it to the favorite , Hatchet . BLUEBLOSSOM You lost ? p. 20 OWEN Well  --  fifty cents , but it was n't that . It was simply that I 'd named my book Tree . BLUEBLOSSOM What is your book about ? OWEN ( Clearly , but casually ) Tree . BLUEBLOSSOM Trees ? OWEN No . Tree . One . BLUEBLOSSOM Well , what do you say about it ? OWEN I do n't say anything about it . I just say it . Tree . You 've seen a tree , have n't you ? Here . ( HARMONY goes to doorway ) That 's a tree right there . ( The tree lights up ) I planted it myself seven years ago , right after we moved to this house . I had an idea we 'd be staying . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLUEBLOSSOM ( Returns to chair ) Of course I 've seen a tree . What else do you say ? OWEN That 's all . That 's only one of my books . It 's one of my favorites , of course , but I 've got others , too . BLUEBLOSSOM ( Sits ) The whole book is just the one word ? p. 21 OWEN Just the one . BLUEBLOSSOM What does it mean ? OWEN ( Impatiently ) Tree . That 's all . T-r-e-e . Well , I was n't in Joe 's ten minutes , and then I was broke and back on the Number Seventeen Street Car , headed home . Well , when I got home my sister was right here in this room as quiet as a human being could be , so of course I knew something was up . What do you suppose that mouse had brought her ? BLUEBLOSSOM The mouse on the cow-catcher ? OWEN Yeah . The one that went down to the waterfront while I was in Joe 's betting on Tree . What do you suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely not something  --  huge . OWEN No . He brought her an almond . BLUEBLOSSOM An almond ? OWEN Yeah , an almond . All the way from the waterfront . He got home sooner than I did . An almond  --  all the way from the waterfront . Well , who can you feed on an almond ? I went for the trap , but my sister said , You 've got no right . It 's not the almond , it 's the effort and the kindness . BLUEBLOSSOM But is n't that stealing ? p. 22 OWEN ( Officially ) Miss Blueblossom , the mice of St. Agnes do not steal . My sister is opposed to theft and murder . In any form . I will not have any stealing , she says , and I will not allow any murdering . That 's why she 's always burning the mousetraps . BLUEBLOSSOM ( Getting her bag ready ) Well . ( She stands ) I 'm afraid I must be going . Thank you very much , young man , for receiving me . OWEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment longer , we 'll see one of the mice . BLUEBLOSSOM Young man . I am an old woman . It 's been pleasant listening to you . You are convincing , you know  --  but I came to call on your father  --  Jonah Webster . I have not seen him in  --  well , thirty years , I believe , but in you I see him again . He was then not quite as young as you are now , but you are , I have no doubt , his son , and he is your father . He had a mind as wild as yours . OWEN ( Impressed and not offended ) Yeah . That 's him . He 'll be here soon , just like I been telling you . He 's out on a street corner somewhere , talking to the people . Wait a little longer . He 'll be glad to see you . I do n't even know you and I 'm glad to see you . p. 23 BLUEBLOSSOM You 're very charming . Please tell Jonah I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door ) Oh , I 'll tell him all right . I 'll tell him you did n't get married . He 'll be awfully flattered . But I wish you 'd wait . BLUEBLOSSOM ( At the door ) And thanks again for your delightful fairy-tale about the mice . OWEN Fairy-tale ? You do n't think I was making that stuff up , do you ? BLUEBLOSSOM ( Smiling gently ) Good-by , young man . OWEN Good-by  --  ( She goes ) Old lady . ( He stands on the porch until she disappears . Turns back to the room , and suddenly becomes excited . Runs after her ) Hey ! Old lady ! The mouse ! The mouse ! It 's come , just like I said it would .  --  Hey ! The mouse ! Old lady ! ( He comes back on the porch . Suddenly points at the trap ) I saw him . He was right there , looking at the trap . I told her if she 'd wait a minute , she 'd see him . ( He enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , looks at the piano . In the distance the cornet is heard playing . ) People do n't believe anything any more  --  not even old ladies . ( He sprawls on the windowseat and is about to go to sleep ) CURTAIN p. 24 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONE Scene Two About an hour later . Small flowers on the floor spell the name Agnes . OWEN is flat on his back , sound asleep . His sister AGNES  --  St. Agnes of the Mice  --  comes into the yard , quietly and sorrowfully . She is a handsome girl in haphazard clothes . Her legs are bare  --  a healthy brown from long walks in all kinds of weather . She goes to the window and looks at her sleeping brother , then enters the house . She sees the trap on the floor , picks it up and throws it in the fire-place . AGNES You 've got no right . ( She stands near OWEN ) Owen ( She shakes him ) OWEN ( In his sleep ) Is that you , Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( OWEN sits up ) OWEN ( Quickly , as he wakes ) What 's the matter ? ( OWEN shakes his head , then smiles foolishly ) Oh , hello , Saint . I thought it was you . ( Stretches sleepily , suddenly notices the flowers and leaps ) Hey , Saint  --  look ! ( He points dramatically , going to the flowers ) A-g-n-e-s , Agnes . St. Agnes , the Little Sister of the Mice . ( He turns to his sister , smiling foolishly . Her face is troubled ) What 's the matter ? p. 25 AGNES ( Quietly ) You ought to be ashamed . OWEN ( Innocently ) Why ? AGNES How could you put a trap out when they 're so full of sorrow ? OWEN I did n't know they were full of sorrow . What are they full of sorrow about ? AGNES One 's lost . ( Stands quietly by the piano ) OWEN ( Snaps his fingers ) That 's why one of them did n't come out . ( Pause , reflecting ) Sure . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGNES ( Sadly ) After who left ? OWEN We had a visitor . An old lady . I wanted to entertain her , so I put the trap out . ( Goes to her ) What 's the matter ? AGNES ( Softly ) I met a man . ( Sadly ) Well , a boy . OWEN Well , what 's the matter ? Are you sorry you hit him ? AGNES I did n't hit him . ( Sits ) We just walked and talked . That 's all . p. 26 OWEN Ah , what 's the matter ? AGNES Well , I like him . He 's not nearly what I thought I 'd find , but I like him . OWEN Well , that 's fine . It 's nice to like somebody . Anybody . ( AGNES puts her hands over her eyes ) Hey ! What are you bawling about ? AGNES I like him . OWEN ( On one knee ) Is that the way it makes you feel ? AGNES ( Slowly ) It makes you feel sick , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to like him , more and more with every breath you take . All we did was walk and talk . We did n't even talk sense . I came home , feeling pity for everything . Not love  --  pity . OWEN ( Rises and touches her arm ) Ah , Saint . Do n't feel bad . Look at your name  --  in flowers . I told the old lady about them , but she did n't believe me . Are you sure he 's lost ? AGNES He 's been gone a week . OWEN Where 'd he go ? AGNES He went to St. Anne 's . OWEN ( Angrily ) St. Anne 's ? Well , it 's a nice state of affairs when one of our mice gets caught in a church trap and we ca n't even set a trap in our own house . p. 27 AGNES What the church is pleased to do about mice is no affair of ours . ( Rises ) Owen ? ( Pause ) OWEN ( Objecting ) How am I going to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look around . He may not be caught , he may be lost  --  trapped in some small room . OWEN ( Takes hold of a chair ) Are you sure that 's what it 's all about ? AGNES Yes , I am . They 're all crying . OWEN ( As he tries to balance the chair on his head ) Well , let ' em cry . What 'd they expect  --  fun ? Things end . They change . They spoil . They 're hurt . Or destroyed . Accidents happen . ( Releases chair and catches it ) Without these things , there could be no  --  no felicity . You ought to know that . Eventually even a tree ends . One at a time , each of them ends , but there are always trees . And that 's the reason : because eventually each of them ends . If you 're going to teach them things , teach them everything . I suppose it 's an improvement for them to be crying over one mouse that 's dead or lost , but sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us from the first breath we take . ( Pause ) Are they crying hard ? p. 28 AGNES ( Simply ) Yes , they are . OWEN I guess he 's dead . AGNES Maybe he is n't . Maybe he 's only hungry and weak  --  caught in a room he ca n't get out of . Please hurry , Owen . OWEN ( Ready to go ) All right . If he 's alive and in the church , I 'll find him . I 'll bring him home . ( JONAH WEBSTER , a little drunk , arrives singing in French : L'Heure Exquise by Reynaldo Hahn . He disappears into the house , followed helplessly by AGNES , and returns in a moment with a bottle of Scotch and a glass . JONAH WEBSTER is a big , powerfully built man in his early sixties . There is something of the poet about him , and something of the fool  --  who is fool by choice . He seems young , almost boyish , simultaneously full of humor and love and noble anger . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pours a drink , is about to toss it down , then suddenly stops . He looks first at OWEN , then at AGNES , then at the flowers , and then all around the room ) JONAH Spectacles and satellites , what 's the tragedy ? What 's troubling this space ? I feel commotion in the air , as though great and tender values were the object of some brutal assault . ( Quietly ) What tragedy is it ? p. 29 AGNES No tragedy , Father . OWEN She met a boy she likes . JONAH ( Loudly , and with some delight ) Time reckoning of bone and blood , is this true ? AGNES ( Broken-hearted ) Yes , it is , Father . JONAH ( Convinced ) Pole star and pyramid ! AGNES ( By the chair ) Wo n't you sit down , Father ? JONAH Sit down ? In this celestial zenith of sweet and holy disorder ? ( Eagerly ) It is sweet , is it not ? OWEN ( Casually ) She 's pretty sore about the whole thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you mean angry ? OWEN Well , angry , then . JONAH Of course she 's angry . Forfeiture and exchange are bound to make one angry , since one is likely to be swindled . Where is he ? Let me behold him . AGNES He is not here . p. 30 JONAH Where is he , then ? AGNES I do n't know . JONAH Well , who is he ? AGNES ( Softly ) We happened to meet on our way out of the Public Library . He held the door open for me . ( Quickly ) I could have held ten doors for his one , but he held the door for me . We walked along together and talked . I do n't know who he is . JONAH Does he know who you are ? AGNES I 'm nobody , Father . JONAH As the sun rises and sets , you have given over . OWEN She was crying a minute ago . AGNES Owen ! ( She turns away ) JONAH ( Reprimanding OWEN ) Hold on . Pole star and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride collapses into animal sickliness when it compares its poise with the insecurity of humility . Flaunting is arrogance , not strength . OWEN I was n't flaunting anything . I just thought you ought to know , that 's all . JONAH I knew . p. 31 OWEN Well , how should I know you knew ? AGNES Did you know , Father ? Is it so plain ? JONAH ( Smiling at the flowers ) And these flowers , Saint ? Another valentine from the mice ? AGNES They 're unhappy . OWEN One of them has been gone a week . AGNES He went to St. Anne 's . OWEN I 'm going there to look for him . JONAH By the adoration of the lamb , that 's the least we can do . Go then , and on your way back , buy a wide variety of provisions . OWEN A wide variety of provisions ?  --  with what ? ( Pulls a pocket inside out ) JONAH With what ? With money . ( He produces a check out of his pocket ) The pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the order of Wilbur M. Stonehedge twenty-four dollars and thirty-seven cents . ( To OWEN ) Have you a pen ? OWEN Father , that check 's been coming for seven years now . p. 32 JONAH Let me fix the meridian . A pen , please . ( OWEN goes to the fireplace shelf for a pen ) I was here when the first check came . I am aware of the chronology involved . OWEN ( At the table , with pen ) That check is n't for us , and never has been . JONAH Spectacles and satellites , of course it 's for us . OWEN ( Handing his father the pen ) It 's addressed to Wilbur M. Stonehedge . JONAH ( Impatiently ) By the moon 's geocentric parallax , the man 's dead ! ( Pause ) And we 're not . ( AGNES at his right , OWEN at his left , JONAH puts his arms around them ) Now I shall fix the meridian . ( AGNES goes out on the porch steps and sits there . JONAH endorses the check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolving property ! The man worked hard for thirty or forty years . Was duly retired on a pension . Came home to live  --  here , in this house . ( Simply ) And died . ( He hands the check to OWEN ) p. 33 OWEN Yes , sir . JONAH Soon after his burial , by the principle of the fixed period , I rented this house for myself and my children , and the check continued to come . If it 's not for us , who is it for ? OWEN Nobody , I guess . JONAH Then run along and fetch the mouse home . OWEN Yes , sir  --  if I can find him . JONAH And on your way back , be sure to buy a wide variety of provisions . A little of everything . We shall spend an hour or two eating and drinking . After that , we shall put a fire in the fireplace and sing . Meat , bread , wine , cheese , greens , a pie , and anything else that occurs to you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Takes another drink ) OWEN Yes , sir . JONAH ( Softly ) And send something to your brother in New York . OWEN I do n't know where he is . Where shall I send it ? JONAH ( Impatiently ) Send it to New York . He 's there somewhere . Send him some money , that 's all . OWEN Yes , sir  --  ( Begins to go , stops ) Oh , yes . An old lady called to see you . p. 34 JONAH ( Irritated ) Old ? OWEN Yes , sir . JONAH ( Swiftly ) Then say no more about it . OWEN She was a very nice old  --  lady . JONAH ( Holding the speech off  --  and pointing at him ) Quiet , by the sun 's retreat through constellations , I am reminded enough of my years by you . OWEN Yes , sir . ( Runs out , and jumps off the porch ) AGNES ( Sadly ) Please try hard , Owen . Look everywhere . OWEN Do n't worry . If he 's there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for you . OWEN ( Stops ) Her name is Harmony . JONAH Whose name ? OWEN The old lady 's . Harmony Blueblossom . JONAH Blueblossom ! ( Pause ) Never heard of her . OWEN Sure you have . She 's a little old lady . She knits . ( OWEN runs off ) p. 35 JONAH ( Shouting ) I do n't know anybody who knits . ( He stands a moment , looking toward the door , perhaps trying to remember who MISS BLUEBLOSSOM might be . Looks at the flowers on the floor , smiles , turns to AGNES . She faces away , looking into the distance , at the sunset . JONAH goes to the piano and plays softly . AGNES enters the room . JONAH stops playing , turns toward her . The sunset deepens ) Saint . ( AGNES turns ) What did you read at the Public Library ? AGNES The encyclopedia  --  about hummingbirds . JONAH Oh , they 're wonderful . AGNES Yes , they can fly backwards . They 're funny , too . They fight great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have held ten doors for his one . JONAH ( Easily , as if he were talking about nothing ) How did it happen ? Did you reach the door exactly when he did ? AGNES Not quite exactly . He was there first . JONAH Was he waiting ? AGNES ( By the doorway ) I 'm not sure . The door 's a big glass door that I never noticed before . And I never noticed before that with all the room in the world a space could still be made . If he was n't waiting , he was there , with the space for me. p. 36 JONAH Did he smile ? AGNES No  --  he almost cried , and then I almost cried , too . He did n't need to stand there that way , and neither did I , but that 's what we did . I could have turned and walked away quickly . I had been walking quickly , but now I could n't move . I wanted to , I guess , but I just could n't . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we just had to stay together . JONAH Where did you go ? AGNES ( Puts her arms around his neck ) First we went out on the steps of the library , but we just stood there , too . We got in the way of some people who were in a hurry . About eleven of them . They did n't like us . Both of us . They turned around and looked at us . There were other people coming and going , too , and we were still in the way . When we got out of their way we were facing the same direction  --  we were n't facing each other . We were together . JONAH Did you speak to him ? AGNES Not at first . I could n't think of anything to say . I did n't think I 'd be able to speak English even  --  and I suppose I did n't , after we did talk  --  what we said was so foolish . JONAH Did you run with him suddenly , perhaps ? p. 37 AGNES ( Kneeling ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into me and I kept bumping into him , and he kept saying excuse me and I kept saying oh that 's all right . He stumbled , too , and said something about his shoes . JONAH What did he say ? AGNES He said they did n't fit . JONAH He 's a good boy , Saint . ( WILLIAM PRIM arrives , stands at the open door , listening intently ) AGNES I know he is , but now I do n't understand anything . I began to seel I did n't used to see . The street cars going by had people in them suddenly . There have always been people in street cars , but now they were beautiful people . I never saw people that way before . They were still sad and funny and worried-looking , but now they were beautiful , too . We walked through the park and looked at everything together . It 's not the same as looking at things alone . We looked at the pigeons , as if they had just come down from the sky . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came to be with us . JONAH Pigeons are good to behold , Saint . AGNES Oh , they 're beautiful . They know people . They live in buildings . p. 38 JONAH How many of them were there ? AGNES Oh , a sky full  --  a thousand , I guess . They circled around and around . He pointed at them and said pigeons . I knew they were pigeons , but when he said they were  --  I liked him . And I knew what he meant , too . JONAH What did he mean , Saint ? AGNES I ca n't say what he meant , but I know what he meant . He did n't mean pigeons . He could n't mean pigeons and say it so sadly . It was the same with everything else , too . Everybody in the street that we passed was new . They were like him . I felt sorry for them . I thought love would be another thing  --  not pity . Is pity love ? JONAH ( Rises ) He 's a good boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bewildered and shy and full of terrible sorrow , and his shoes do n't fit . JONAH But his feet within them do . ( He turns and notices PRIM , whom he believes to be a door-to-door salesman ) Not today . Some other time . PRIM Oh . ( He goes ) AGNES ( Slowly , as if she were seeking the words ) I 've waited every day  --  to meet one person in the world  --  who would n't offend me  --  and now that I 've found him  --  instead of being heedless  --  and strong  --  and full of humor  --  he 's sad . He could be barefooted for all I care , if he would n't be sad  --  because now I 'm sad , too . ( With youthful anger ) I wo n't allow it . Pity 's no seed to throw among the living . It 's for mice , whose littleness rejoices with it . I ca n't believe to live  --  to really live  --  is foolish or impossible . ( In soft voice ) Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not for you ; not for me ; and not for your brothers . AGNES ( Solemnly ) We 're not apart from the others , Father . I thought we were , but we 're not . We are they , and they are us . I know that now . I do n't want the foolish life . I 'll learn to live all over again , but if I ca n't live the life I know is mine to live , if everything is to be meaningless and foolish  --  JONAH Saint ! It is n't meaningless or foolish . ( It is now early evening ) AGNES ( Almost angry , turning away ) But I ca n't forget him . Why am I so afraid I 'll never see him again ? ( Almost breaking down ) Will I see him again , Father ? JONAH He 's not lost , Saint . AGNES He looked lost . I do n't even know who he is . JONAH Whoever he is , he 'll be here in this room before the world comes to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGNES ( Sits ) I do n't know . JONAH You must decide , Saint . AGNES I guess I 'll be glad , then . ( Pause ) p. 40 JONAH And will you look for him ? ( AGNES looks up ) Will you go out into the streets and look for him ? ( She looks at her father ) Will you go everywhere in the city looking for him ? ( She rises , looking away ) He ca n't get far , Saint . His shoes do n't fit . Will you look for him ? ( AGNES moves to the door . There she stops momentarily , moves to the porch , then suddenly hurries away down the hill and disappears , suggesting a bird in joyous flight ) ( JONAH picks up one of the flowers , looks at it , smiling , and then goes back to singing in French ) @x JONAH is at the piano playing softly . AGNES comes home , holding a flower . She drops it inside the room , at the door . She hurries into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns . He is a neatly dressed little man of fifty or so . He checks the house number , comparing it with the number he has on a small piece of paper . He comes up on the porch and is about to enter , when he notices the flower on the floor . He picks it up , smiles , and puts the flower in his lapel . At the open door he knocks . JONAH turns and looks at him . JONAH All right . Come in . ( PRIM enters the room without saying a word . He goes to the table the hard way , takes off his hat , lays it on the chair . Places his briefcase on the table and begins to take out a number of envelopes , papers , and documents with seals and ribbons on them . Suddenly he stops , his attention drawn to something fascinating in his briefcase . He looks for a moment , then looks again as he lowers his head . He takes out a small toy whistle . He smiles at the toy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle makes a sorrowful little sound ) JONAH ( Loudly ) Cool , clean chemistry , man , is that what you 're selling ? Here 's a dime . Give me that whistle . p. 42 PRIM ( Protesting ) Oh , no  --  that 's my own . ( He looks at the whistle proudly ) A souvenir of a voyage to Mexico eleven years ago . ( Remembering the voyage , while JONAH looks on somberly ) JONAH Oh , I see . PRIM ( Speaks in a hushed , shy , courteous whisper , but with great emphasis ) Yes . There was the second officer  --  a man named Gabbage . A schoolteacher from Calistoga with a very large nose . A young man named Collins who was interested in bull fighting . A Mrs. Sedley of society . And myself  --  ( Realizing his presence there , as he smiles ) Of course . Dinner was quite an event every evening , but one night  --  the third night out  --  there was a celebration  --  an actual celebration  --  the choicest food , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly speeches , spontaneous , unrehearsed , and with no subject . Dances  --  ah ! ( Pause , while he smiles ) A celebration truly . In the finest sense of the word . Mrs. Sedley , a most cultured woman , was very friendly to me . JONAH ( Pleased ) I 'm delighted . p. 43 PRIM A memorable experience ( Sadly ) from which I have salvaged this souvenir . ( He blows the whistle again . Remembers the happy occasion a moment longer , and then puts the whistle on the table ) But there is work to be done . I have here  --  JONAH ( Moving in ) Yes , by the science of seafaring , what are all those papers ? PRIM ( Going over the papers , and examining them one by one ) Well , this is the  --  ( Mumbling ) The third party of the third part  --  ( In his natural voice ) And this is  --  And this  --  In short , we were under the impression that you were alive .  --  But this  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to our notice  --  reports your death and burial . Consequently , we are no longer obliged to continue the monthly pension payment  --  in the sum of  --  ( Looks for something else on the table , finally remembers it is in his pocket . He brings forth a small wrinkled paper from which he reads ) Twenty-four dollars and thirty-seven cents , every month , twelve months per year . ( Replaces paper in his pocket ) In the event of death , you see the pension becomes automatically null and void  --  null and void . ( Sincerely ) I 'm sorry . ( Turns to his papers ) p. 44 JONAH ( Loudly ) We stand in the orbit of a superior planet . PRIM ( Not quite able to understand . Looks at JONAH , then up and around ) Thank you . ( He replaces the papers . The whistle is the last item . He smiles again , blows it , then with determination places it in his briefcase and finally is ready to leave ) It 's been a pleasure . JONAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to JONAH , who takes it ) Good-by . JONAH Good-by . ( They bow to each other . PRIM goes out , but stops on the porch , not able to straighten out everything in his mind . AGNES enters , looks at her father , then goes to the mantelpiece over the fireplace and fills a glass with wine . PRIM returns . He comes forward toward JONAH . Looks all around JONAH , still not able to understand ) PRIM ( Eagerly ) Is n't there a mistake ? JONAH ( Casually ) No , I believe not . I believe everything is quite in order . PRIM ( Very much relieved ) I thought so myself . ( Delighted ) Of course . ( AGNES brings the glass of wine forward , notices PRIM , offers him the drink . PRIM is ready to accept , but must with regret refuse ) No , thank you . I never partake of intoxicating beverages . ( AGNES offers the wine to JONAH , who drinks it and returns the glass to her . She puts the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to JONAH intimately ) I have a daughter of my own . Seventeen years old . ( He offers his hand to JONAH again , who takes it again ) Good-by . ( They bow to each other . He bows to AGNES ) p. 45 OWEN ( From a distance ) I found him ! I 've got him , Saint ! ( OWEN hurries to the porch and into the room . AGNES runs out to meet him . PRIM follows AGNES , stops by the doorway ) AGNES ( Looking out ) Where is he ? OWEN ( Stopping , just inside the room ) Here . In this paper . ( PRIM follows him to the center of the room ) JONAH ( To OWEN ) By the map of the stars , what the devil happened to you ? OWEN ( Putting the paper on the floor and getting down on his knees ) He was up in the steeple . ( To AGNES ) Here he is , Saint . Safe and sound . I knew I 'd find him . ( AGNES is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward ) Is he all right ? ( On her knees ) OWEN All right ? He 's in better shape than ever . Tell ' em to stop crying . Tell ' em the lost sheep has been returned to the fold . PRIM ( Looking at the crumpled paper ) What 's in that paper ? p. 46 OWEN ( To JONAH ) Who 's that ? JONAH ( Casually ) The man who made the voyage to Mexico . OWEN Oh . ( To AGNES ) Well , Saint , take a look at him . ( He opens the paper a bit ) JONAH ( With delight ) Wee sleekit , tim'rous beastie ! PRIM Is it a mouse ? AGNES ( Sadly ) But it 's not one of our mice . ( She goes toward door ) OWEN Sure it is . AGNES ( Turning ) No , it is n't . OWEN ( Leaping to his feet ) Well , it was the only mouse in the whole church . ( Rises ) Saint , I 'm not going to take him back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . I do n't know what he 's been eating . He looks like one of our mice . AGNES He is n't , though . OWEN Well , maybe they 'll like him just as much as the one that 's lost  --  or dead . What 's the difference ? This is a nice mouse . How 'd he ever get way up there in that steeple ? p. 47 PRIM ( To JONAH ) It 's a mouse , is n't it ? JONAH A shaft of lightning in the clod . PRIM What 's the matter with it ? JONAH ( Explaining ) It liveth . PRIM Oh , it 's alive , then . JONAH The same as thou  --  or I. PRIM ( Smiling ) Well , look at that  --  perfectly alive . OWEN ( To AGNES ) Well , are n't you glad ? You 're always complaining about the traps . Well , here 's a mouse from the steeple of St. Anne 's  --  living alone up there ; no friends , no fires , no people with their crumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells . Are n't you glad , Saint ? AGNES ( On her knees again ) I 'm glad , Owen . Only that 's a proud mouse . OWEN ( Delighted ) Is it ? AGNES That 's a mouse that does n't like other mice . OWEN ( Sincerely ) Say  --  that 's swell . No fooling , Saint ? p. 48 AGNES That 's a mouse that is n't afraid , either . PRIM ( Like a child ) What are you going to do with him ? AGNES I 'll take him back to the steeple . OWEN ( Rises , objecting bitterly ) No . I 'll keep him . AGNES ( Rises ) You have no right . OWEN What do you mean ? ( To JONAH ) If I set a trap because the house is full of mice , she says I have no right . ( To PRIM , as he points his finger ) If I go all over St. Anne 's looking for a mouse that 's supposed to be one of our mice , and find another mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep him , she says I have no right again . ( To AGNES ) Why not ? AGNES ( Determined ) He 's going back . OWEN ( Giving up ) All right , there he is . You can do anything you want with him . Where 's my paper ? ( Takes his pad and crayon from fireplace ) I 'm going to write another book . ( He looks at the mouse ) Mouse . ( Loudly , as he points ) There he is . Mouse . ( AGNES goes to window ) p. 49 JONAH Pole star and pyramid , when are you going to write a book with two words ? OWEN When I know two of ' em . ( Writing on a large tablet ) I 've got to find out about nouns before I move to verbs . You 've got to be careful about verbs , otherwise you 'll get things all mixed up  --  even worse than they are already . Is . That 's a verb . I 've got to be careful when I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth with hands ) Is . PRIM Is what ? OWEN ( Angrily and loudly ) What do you mean , what ? Is , that 's all . Is . PRIM Oh . OWEN ( Showing the tablet to JONAH ) There  --  another book . JONAH ( Takes pad and examines it . In a loud voice ) Moose ? Moose and mouse are not the same , boy . OWEN Oh . I 've got to learn to spell some day . ( Sits . He corrects the spelling . To PRIM , suddenly , scaring him ) What sort of a voyage was it ? JONAH ( To PRIM ) Tell the boy about the voyage . p. 50 PRIM Oh , yes . ( Delighted , rises ) Well , we left San Francisco at five o'clock in the afternoon . A beautiful day . My wife and daughter were on the dock , waving and crying . My daughter was six at the time , and my wife  --  was pretty well along in years . AGNES ( At window ) I 'll take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OWEN To the Public Library ? AGNES ( Angry ) Owen ! PRIM I waved back of course , and cried a little , too . It was so wonderful having them on the dock , with me on the boat  --  bound for Acapulco , adventure and romance . Well , we sailed out of the harbor , through the Golden Gate , and on out into the beautiful sea . AGNES ( Looks in the paper , excited ) He 's gone ! OWEN ( Hurriedly opens the paper ) He 's gone all right . Well , maybe he 's gone back to the church . AGNES He must n't go among the other mice . OWEN ( Angry and offended ) Why not ? p. 51 AGNES Well , he must n't , that 's all . I know why . OWEN ( Shouting ) Well , what did you let him get away for , then ? AGNES ( Controlling her voice ) You need n't shout . I can shout as loud as you . I ca n't help it if he ran away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? JONAH There have been greater tragedies . PRIM What was the matter with it ? JONAH The same . It liveth . PRIM Oh . OWEN I did my best , that 's all I know . He 's probably gone back to the steeple anyway , where he belongs . ( To PRIM ) Then what happened ? PRIM ( Confused ) When ? OWEN When you got out on the beautiful sea . PRIM ( Rises , goes to table ) Oh , yes . Well . Here . I 'll show you . ( He opens the briefcase and begins bringing out the papers and envelopes again ) p. 52 OWEN ( To JONAH ) What 's he looking for ? JONAH By the changing heavens , a whistle ! PRIM ( Pausing to read a document with a seal on it ) In the event of death , you see , the pension becomes automatically null and void . ( Pause , as he puts the paper back into the briefcase ) Null and void . A routine procedure , of course  --  ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter ? PRIM I believe something alive is in the palm of my hand . ( Excited ) Oh , goodness . OWEN What 's the matter now ? PRIM I believe it 's moved up my shirt sleeve . ( Confused ) Dinner was quite an event every evening , but one night  --  ( He wiggles his left shoulder , while everybody watches with fascination )  --  there was  --  ( He wiggles his right shoulder )  --  a celebration . Mrs. Sedley  --  JONAH Wonderful ! p. 53 PRIM It was the happiest experience of my life . ( Pause ) I do believe something rather large is crawling about on me . OWEN ( Anxiously ) How many feet has it got ? PRIM Let me see . ( He wiggles , counting on his fingers ) Three . OWEN ( To AGNES ) Three ? Was that a three-legged mouse ? PRIM ( Correcting himself ) No . Four . OWEN It 's the mouse all right . AGNES ( To PRIM ) You must hurry right down to St. Anne 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not a Catholic . I 'm a Methodist . AGNES ( Trying to hurry him out ) It 's five blocks down the hill . You must hurry up into the steeple . PRIM ( Severely ) I beg your pardon ? AGNES Hurry now , before it 's too late . Run ! ( She hurries him out of the open door ) p. 54 PRIM ( In the yard ) Run ? I have n't run in years . AGNES Well , you simply must run now . PRIM Very well , then . ( He runs across the yard and down the hill ) OWEN Is he running ? AGNES Yes , he is . ( Pause ) No , he is n't . ( Shouting to PRIM ) Run  --  run ! PRIM ( From a distance ) The mouse  --  it 's gone . AGNES Are you sure ? PRIM ( Closer now ) Yes , I am . It ran down my leg . AGNES He 's lost the mouse . ( Returning to the room ) The mouse simply does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here , with the other mice . OWEN Well , all right , then , let the poor mouse alone . PRIM ( Returning to the room and standing at the table , as before ) Well , there we were , alone on the top deck . p. 55 OWEN Who ? PRIM Mrs. Sedley and myself  --  on the voyage to Acapulco . ( He takes up his briefcase again ) Here . I have a souvenir of the occasion right here . ( To JONAH suddenly , eagerly ) Was it a mouse ? JONAH It was not a part of thyself crawling . PRIM ( Suddenly shocked ) Oh , dear . ( He collapses into JONAH 'S arms . JONAH lets him down easily , to lie on the floor ) JONAH Pole star and pyramid ! AGNES I 'll get him a glass of water . OWEN What 's the matter with him ? ( DAN , an old drunkard , comes in carrying a basket full of groceries ) HILLBOY Here 's the provisions , Joe . ( He sets the box on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you arrived . Now we 'll sit down to a royal feast . HILLBOY ( Noticing PRIM ) What 's the matter with him ?  --  Drunk ? ( OWEN goes to the basket of groceries and starts to examine them . AGNES returns with a glass of water , tries to get PRIM to drink , fails , drinks the water herself . DAN shakes PRIM ) Get up , man . Pull yourself together . It 's alcohol that 's made the war . Alcohol and weak men , such as yourself . ( Holding PRIM up ) Stand up , man . Here . Let me take you to the kitchen for a glass of water . Sooner or later , like I 've been telling ' em thirty years , alcohol is going to destroy the human race . ( To PRIM ) And a little mouse of a man like you , drinking intoxicating beverages . Come along , man . You 'll be the ruin of the race . ( Everybody follows DAN and PRIM into the kitchen ) p. 56 CURTAIN p. 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper , about two hours later . Beyond the windows is visible a beautiful clear night , with moon and stars . The three men come in from the interior of the house .

The singing could not have been  --  finer . The speech-making could not have been  --  finer . ( In a stronger voice ) As for the company  --  HILLBOY The company could not have been finer . PRIM Yes , Dan . I shall never forget this wonderful evening . It has been most memorable . JONAH I 'm delighted you have been happy . Come by any time at all . PRIM ( Sincerely thrilled ) May I ? JONAH I shall be disappointed if you do n't . HILLBOY But do n't drink . Just keep a sober head on your shoulders and everything is going to be all right . PRIM ( Sincerely ) Thank you , Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . p. 58 HILLBOY Ah , it 's nothing . Any sober , God-fearing , home-loving man would have done the same . PRIM Thank you , Dan . ( To JONAH , as he pats his briefcase ) Well , I have everything in order . The check will continue to come on schedule of course , but hereafter the sum will be ten dollars more . JONAH By the law of fertility and timekeeping , I am deeply grateful . PRIM ( Modestly ) It 's nothing . The company can well spare it . As vice-president , I have the authority to do so . HILLBOY ( Impressed ) Vice-president ? PRIM Oh , yes , Dan . ( He extends his hand to DAN , who shakes it vigorously ) HILLBOY You 're going to be all right , do n't you worry about that . A little sip now and then for the stomach , but nothing more . Can I help you to the street ? PRIM No , thanks , Dan . I 'm quite all right . ( To JONAH ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand .

Joe , a weak man like that should never touch a drop . JONAH Now , Dan , I 've been dry long enough . Fetch the pretty bottle and we 'll sit down to a quiet little game of casino . HILLBOY It 's the disgrace of the weak that makes the noble life of the strong so full of sorrow and misery . ( Bringing out a big beautiful bottle of wine and two glasses ) It 's the terrible disgrace of the weak . JONAH ( As he looks out at the sky ) Then pour a drink , Dan , to the sweet smiling face of the universe . HILLBOY We 'll take a cup of kindness yet , with none of the little vice-presidents around . JONAH ( Shuffling a deck of cards idly ) Then pour it , Dan , while you and I are still alive . HILLBOY ( Pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor . The little men with the wonderful official documents .

DAN smacks his lips , then belches ) p. 60 JONAH ( As he pushes his glass forward again ) By the changing heavens , Dan , then pour again , and cut the cards . ( DAN cuts the cards , and JONAH deals . They take their hands and begin to play . They talk and drink as they play ) HILLBOY It 's the weak make the wars , Joe . ( Pause , as they play ) And Harold  --  what 's the word from him . ( JONAH looks away in silence . After a moment the cornet is heard playing in the distance ) JONAH ( As the cornet stops ) He 's well , Dan . HILLBOY Then God protect him . ( FATHER HOGAN of St. Anne 's comes in . He is a heavy-set cheerful-faced man in his early sixties . DAN gets up quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonah ! JONAH As the sun rises and sets , Father Hogan ! ( Taking HOGAN 'S arm ) Come , sit down and sip a glass of wine , young man . FATHER HOGAN I 'm no younger than thyself  --  and we 're both old men , and maybe old fools . ( Shouting ) Dan , for the love of God , sit down ! p. 61 HILLBOY ( Leaping ) Yes , Father . ( He sits down as if obeying a command ) Just a drop for my stomach , as the good Lord 's my witness . ( He points upward , toward the good Lord ) FATHER HOGAN ( Shakes his head ) Dan , you do n't understand . I believe you . I 've always believed you . You need n't imagine that every time you speak I regard what you say as a lie . I do n't , Dan . I believe you . ( Softly ) So why do n't you ? HILLBOY I do , Father . I believe every word I say . Every word . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Shouting warmly at HOGAN ) Come you , now , sit down and sip a glass of wine . ( DAN gets a chair ) You need not be a vigilant Christian every minute . Sit down , Hogan . FATHER HOGAN Let me stand a moment , Jonah . Is there a drop for my stomach ? JONAH Dan , a glass for Father Hogan . HILLBOY ( Fetches a glass with the happiness of a retriever ) Aye , we 'll take a cup of kindness yet . p. 62 JONAH Then pour it , Dan . HILLBOY ( Brave and loud ) Aye , a cup of kindness among men of the good brotherhood . ( Offers glass of wine to FATHER HOGAN ) Father ? ( FATHER HOGAN takes the glass ) FATHER HOGAN ( Waves them to sit ) Sit down , boys  --  ( He sips , then very seriously ) Jonah . ( He sighs and stops ) Your son Owen came to the church this afternoon  --  for the first time in his life . JONAH I 've no quarrel with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to St. Anne 's ? FATHER HOGAN His behavior in church was most irregular . JONAH Irregular ? FATHER HOGAN ( Noticing DAN with his hand on his glass , wanting to drink but ashamed to do so ) Go ahead , Dan , drink it . I know it 's for thy stomach . HILLBOY ( Trying to rid himself of his sense of guilt ) I was just going to , Father . I was just going to . ( Lifting his glass ) To the good brotherhood , Father . p. 63 FATHER HOGAN Very well , Dan . HILLBOY ( To JONAH as he drinks ) Joe ? JONAH Then , drink it down , Dan . ( DAN nods and drinks , behaving very much like a boy who has been forgiven and is beside himself with joy . JONAH gets up , speaking to HOGAN ) Sit down , now . ( He takes HOGAN by the arm and makes him sit at the table . JONAH remains standing ) Cool , clean chemistry , man , tell us what the boy 's done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . What 's he done ? FATHER HOGAN ( Sits down ) Jonah , he was found running about the church , upstairs and down , and was asked by Father O'Mara what he was doing . He replied that he was worshiping , and continued to run about with Father O'Mara following as well as he was able to . Father O'Mara called Father Lewis who asked the boy what he was seeking . He replied that he was seeking the lost lamb , as any good Christian would . Father O'Mara and Father Lewis , both young men , were confused and , I suppose , a little upset . They returned to their studies , but soon after heard a terrible commotion in the church itself , like the opening of the heavens . It was the boy , inside the pipe organ . ( Very emphatically ) He 'd fallen in. p. 64 JONAH He was looking for a mouse . FATHER HOGAN ( Shocked ) A mouse ? JONAH One of our own mice . His sister had sent him . Half in jest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice of this house for many years now , with the result that we have named her St. Agnes of the Mice . HILLBOY ( Drinking ) Aye  --  St. Agnes of the Mice . JONAH Now , you and I know mice are insensible creatures and can not respond to affection and kindness . Well , it appears she did not know , and that they did respond  --  in a way . FATHER HOGAN I do n't understand . JONAH Father Hogan , if I do not encourage the imaginations of my children , I also do not hinder them . With her faith in the mice grew her faith in herself . As that faith grew , intelligence and humanity grew , and with these things came a greater and deeper expectation of others , of all the living . And , naturally , the possibility of deep disappointment , which may eventually become disillusionment , or even contempt . I think I 'll soon know , since only this afternoon she met a boy whose reality moved her to pity for the whole world . Which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 65 HILLBOY ( Drinking ) Aye , the true humanity . JONAH Her brother sometimes puts flowers out for her , here on the floor , as though they were from the mice , and once when she was very ill , he stayed up all night , grumbling to himself . Actually he was praying for her . When she was better again , he told her the mice had prayed for her . Because she had watched over them . It 's no matter to me what pattern faith or humor may take . She came home this afternoon broken-hearted , and told him so by pretending the mice were crying because one of them had been lost  --  at St. Anne 's . Your church . That 's why he was there this afternoon . I suppose he ruined the pipe organ . Well , I 'll pay for it  --  little by little . FATHER HOGAN On the contrary , the pipe organ has been out of order for some time . It 's in better condition now than it ever was . JONAH Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HILLBOY ( Holds glass out ) Aye , it 's the truth . JONAH ( Standing ) Then , drink to it , Dan . ( Pause ) I would n't be able to speak of these things to anyone but you and Dan here , because the poor faithless minds of the others I know would make the meaning foolish instead of simple and true , as it is . ( Pause , trying to explain ) Every life in the world is a miracle , and it 's a miracle every minute each of us stays alive , and unless we know this , the experience of living is cheated of the greater part of its wonder and beauty . p. 66 HILLBOY ( Drinking ) Aye , the wonder and the beauty of it . JONAH I sometimes stand on street corners and talk to people , as you do inside the church . My only disciple is Dan here , but he 's a good one . But my church is the whole blooming universe , and mice are as much a part of its magnificence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive with all other things alive , from the mite to the whale . Pole star and pyramid , man , I tell them the same things on street corners that you tell them inside the church . ( Pause ) From my heart to the pole star is the straightest line in the world , and as the star moves , so moves my heart  --  and yours , and Dan 's and everybody 's . HILLBOY Aye , the wonder and the beauty of it . ( He sips ) JONAH The image of the pyramid to the human mind is the image of our grace as men . The slaves who built the pyramid  --  the thousands of them over the hundreds of years  --  did not know the majesty of the thing being made . But the image of that thing began where it ended  --  in the living human mind . The line goes from one to the other : from the heart to the star , and from the star to the pyramid , and from the pyramid back to the heart . From one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen as a whole majesty , or not to be seen at all . I choose to see , since I am by nature a religious man . p. 67 HILLBOY Aye , and I , too . ( He drinks ) FATHER HOGAN I know that , Jonah . JONAH It 's not enough to make a record of the world  --  it 's necessary to change it ! And you can not begin to change it from the outside . The image of the good must first be real to the mind before it can inhabit substance and occupy space . My world is myself and my kinship with all other things . And my delight is my children . We are exactly the same as all other people , but I know we live better than the rich and better than the poor , because the values which make rich and poor are without image or reality , and the real values are the only values we recognize and cherish . We live faithfully , and sometimes , by the standards of the world , mischievously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes here every month for a man who has been dead seven years . We have no idea who the man was , but he 's dead , and each month we have sent the money back , spending it . My youngest  --  the boy who ran about in your church this afternoon  --  gambles , and sometimes , I must say , wins . Again we send the money back . Even in the eyes of the world , we would be better , gladly and gratefully , if the world itself would be , but since it is n't , we refuse to exchange our values for its values . I know  --  and I have taught my children to know  --  that all things of matter must be only the image of the real . The pyramid must not be the waste of a million lives , but the poetry of every life . p. 68 HILLBOY Aye , the poetry . The wonder and the beauty of it . ( He sips , listening drunkenly . AGNES runs up onto the porch ) AGNES ( Whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and talked , and he 's coming here tomorrow to meet you . He 's shy and afraid  --  but I 've found him . JONAH Of course you 've found him , Saint . AGNES And I do n't feel sad anymore . I feel the same , but I feel happy now . His name 's John . JONAH It 's a good name . AGNES I want to go out and walk and look at everything again , because now I understand . JONAH You need n't tell me , Saint . Tell the night . Tell the little children who are n't sure and the old people who 've forgotten . ( AGNES kisses JONAH 'S forehead . She goes to DAN , kisses him on the forehead , then to FATHER HOGAN and kisses him on the forehead . Then quickly turns and runs . The three men are silent a moment . JONAH goes to the window , then turns ) Did you see her , Father Hogan ? Did you see her , Dan ? HILLBOY ( Very drunk ) Aye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head on his arms , wearily ) p. 69 FATHER HOGAN I 'm glad the boy came to the church this afternoon . His presence there , for the first time in his life , now has meaning , and I 'm grateful , even if he was only looking for a mouse . JONAH ( Standing ) No , not a mouse . For the image of the living heart 's shyest , most kindly smile . ( Pause , solemnly ) The absence of their brother has taught them  --  and myself , too  --  the preciousness of one another . One 's son , one 's daughter , one 's neighbor  --  and the stranger , brotherless and homeless . ( Almost pathetically ) We 've been worried , Father . Oh , we know he 's all right  --  we know nothing can happen to him , because he 's goo  --  but we ca n't help it . He wanted to go , so I wanted him to go . Now , I 've lost faith , because I believed goodness was a coin for exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only coin . ( Pause ) I 'm no longer sure . ( Angry but softly ) If anything happens to my son  --  if the world destroys him or anything in him , which all men should have  --  ( Bitterly ) I shall be the most corrupt of men . ( He goes to the piano  --  sits  --  his back turned to them ) It was good of you to come tonight , Father . I needed you to talk to . My children must not know that what I have taught them may be useless in this world . p. 70 FATHER HOGAN ( Simply ) I understand , Jonah . ( JONAH in silence turns to the piano , as if to play . He strikes several chords softly , then stops . He stands , moves to archway , and leans there , turned away ) ( Rises , goes to DAN . Places his hand on DAN 'S shoulder ) I 'll take you home , Dan . Can you walk ? HILLBOY ( Lifts his head ) Walk ? Dan Hillboy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , falls back , makes a real effort , falls back again . He looks up pathetically into HOGAN 'S face , almost weeping ) I 'm drunk , Father . FATHER HOGAN Shall I leave thee , Dan ? HILLBOY Wait , Father . I 'll walk beside thee . It 's my head  --  the years I 've lost . The swift , sweet years that passed me by . I was turning a corner , Father , and then all of a sudden the years were gone . I 've told Joe , Father . He knows . He believes me . FATHER HOGAN I believe you , Dan . HILLBOY ( Amazed at the waste ) A street corner , Father . But ever since , on a night like this , the years come back . They come back to the breathing of my boyhood , and want me back , where I belong . ( Calling bitterly ) Dan Hillboy ! Lean , young Dan  --  with his muscles hard and his belt tight and his shoes hitting the sidewalk like the feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger  --  a weak , pathetic fool who 's stolen the name of my life . ( Swiftly and with anger ) I was the good companion of them all , and they knifed me . ( He clutches his heart ) They ganged up on me in the dark night as I came by whistling and hitting my shoes against the sidewalk , and they fell upon me . But they 'll never kill me . As long as there are nights like this night in the world , Dan Hillboy will be there , young and hard , in the street of life . The murderers wo n't be there , Father , but Dan Hillboy  --  he 'll be there . Where a man 's born , he 'll live , and Dan Hillboy was born in the immortal world . ( He stops , looks around pathetically ) I 'm sick , Father . I 'm sick of the waste . I 'm sick of the lies I tell myself . p. 71 FATHER HOGAN They 're not lies , Dan . HILLBOY ( Looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you believe me ? FATHER HOGAN I believe you , Dan . Come . Stand up , and we 'll go out and look into the sky . HILLBOY ( Standing ) Aye , Father , I 'll walk beside thee . ( OWEN comes running in with something in his clenched fist . He stops short , looks around , trying to understand what 's the matter . JONAH turns and looks at the boy . As he smiles , the boy begins to smile ) JONAH Pole star and pyramid , boy , she 's found him . He goes by the name John . OWEN ( Pleased , then suddenly ) Oh . I forgot to give you the change from the check . ( He hands JONAH a fistful of coins ) You 'll be wanting a coin to jingle soon . JONAH Spectacles and satellites , have you kept something out for gambling ? OWEN I 've got something kept .  --  You know what I 've got here ? A little frog ! I found him ! I 'm going to write another book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He notices DAN and HOGAN waiting ) I 'll be home soon . ( He takes DAN 'S arm ) Come along , Dan . We 'll walk down the hill to St. Anne 's  --  and Harry 's Bar . p. 72 HILLBOY Aye , Joe . St. Anne 's , and Harry 's . FATHER HOGAN And I 'll buy thee a drink , Dan . ( The three men go , as OWEN watches . He then opens his fist and looks closely at what he 's got in his hand ) OWEN Now . Hop and let 's have a look at you . Come on , now , hop . Hop ! ( The frog hops and lands on the floor . OWEN gets down on all fours and looks into the eyes of the little frog ) Can you see me ? Can you hear me ? ( He goes to the window and tosses the frog out . Then turns to the piano . From a distance the cornet is heard again . He tries to get closer to the music . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come by any time at all . Can I come by now ? OWEN Sure . Sure . Glad to have you . ( He goes on listening . At the window , he sits . HARMONY BLUEBLOSSOM comes in . She stands , amazed , staring at PRIM ) BLUEBLOSSOM ( To PRIM ) Jonah ? PRIM ( With his customary bewilderment ) How do you do ? BLUEBLOSSOM Surely you 're not  --  Jonah ? p. 73 PRIM Jonah ? Who 's Jonah ? BLUEBLOSSOM ( To OWEN ) Young man . This man is not your father , is he ? OWEN No , but he 's a good man . He sends the pension check . He made a voyage to Mexico once , too . ( He continues to listen . The cornet is heard closer ) BLUEBLOSSOM ( To PRIM ) Is that so ? PRIM Oh , yes . It was the most wonderful experience of my life . ( The cornet comes closer ) OWEN ( Suddenly , desperately ) Miss Blueblossom  --  are you sure you do n't hear a cornet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLUEBLOSSOM ( Listening ) Of course I hear a cornet . Someone 's playing a cornet . OWEN ( To PRIM ) Tell the truth , now . Do you hear a cornet ? PRIM ( Listening ) Why , yes , of course . ( OWEN stands , as if in a trance . HARMONY looks at him intently ) p. 74 OWEN ( To himself ) He 's coming up the hill , through the woods where we used to play . ( Takes his tablet to the table , sits and writes ) Two words : My brother . PRIM Are you his mother ? BLUEBLOSSOM No . Not exactly . Almost . PRIM Almost ? Oh , it 's wonderful to be here . ( AGNES runs into the house . OWEN and AGNES look at one another , hoping the cornet is real this time ) BLUEBLOSSOM St. Agnes of the Mice ! PRIM Oh , yes . One of the mice got on me . On me . ( AGNES and OWEN move to archway , listening . Everybody stands still . Nobody speaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is playing the cornet . Walking behind him is a small young man , STEVE , who is smoking a rolled cigarette . In front of the steps , the solo ends , and HAROLD stands staring at the place . He enters the house . OWEN pushes HAROLD 'S chair forward for him . HAROLD sits , STEVE in back of him ) HAROLD Hello , Saint . Hello , Shakespeare . ( Points at STEVE ) This is Steve . He has n't got a home . ( To STEVE ) Did n't I tell you ? Is n't it exactly like I told you ? ( In quick succession , first JONAH , then DAN , and then FATHER HOGAN arrive , and stand looking at the miracle , speechless but smiling ) p. 75 JONAH ( Whispering ) Pole star and pyramid ! Play it again , boy . Play it again . ( HAROLD begins to play the cornet again . STEVE places a battered black stovepipe hat over it , and watches with admiration . OWEN goes to HAROLD and sits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and places it on HAROLD 'S head . PRIM and HARMONY move in , watching . All look at HAROLD as he plays . The curtain comes down and quickly goes up again as HAROLD is still playing )
