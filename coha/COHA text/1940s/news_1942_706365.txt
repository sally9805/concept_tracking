txt Special Cable to THE NEW YORK THERE . LONDON , April ** wage earners and producers escaped heavier income taxes today for the first time since the war began when Sir Kingsley Wood , Chancellor of the Exchequer , presented a budget calling for revenues this year of ? 4,500,000,000 and expenditures of ? 5,286,000,000 , * in addition to United States leaselend aid , now running at the rate of about i100,060,000 monthly . Most of the burden of new taxation will fall upon spenders rather than earners and is designed not only to raise funds for the prosecution of the war but to curtail consumption and thus increase savings and subscriptions to government loans . Some of the proposed new imposts on consumer goods and services which , while not all luxuries in the strictest sense , can not be regarded as essentials , are staggering , but since they are more or less hidden they probably will prove less painful than even the slightest increase in the income tax , which already amounts to half of the average earnings . The purchase tax on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-3 , and included within its scope are not only silk articles , perfume and cosmetics but many items of household furnishings , trunks , suitcases , musical instruments , clocks , watches and scores of other articles of greater or less impoptance . As a means of adding attractiveness to rather uninteresting " utility " clothes and shoes the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that they would be exempt from the purchase tax . The duty on tobacco will be raised 650 an ounce ; the tax on wines will be increased 163 a gallon on foreign wines and 12s on Empire wines , and the tax on beer will go up 2d a pint . Whisky , of which there is a serious shortage , now will cost 4s 8d more a bottle , and after May 10 the already high entertainment tax is to be doubled . Before coming to this part of his long address Sir Kingsley estimated that revenues that could be raised through existing taxation would fall ? 150,000,000 short of the required ? 2,374,000,000 , and he made the interesting observation that 85 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income taxes would be in the hands of people with gross incomes of less than ? 500 a year . As he spoke he looked straight at the Labor benches , while Lady Astor jumped up and , pointing in their direction , shouted : " The new rich ! " Sir Kingsley pointed out that last year he rounded off a series of budgets that in less than twenty months had raised the income tax from Ss 6d per pound to los per pound and had lifted the maximum rate on high incomes from 14s 6d per pound to 19s 6d and , by reducing various allowances previously made , brought nearly 4,000,000 new taxpayers within the income tax sphere . Tax Weight NoW Heaviest " The last series of imposts widening the area of taxation is too recent , " he said , " for me to contemplate a further examination at the moment . The weight of the last budget is only now being borne in its full severity . If we were to take away every penny of income above ? 2,000 from those whose incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only be about ? 30,000,000 . " He cited these facts , the Chancellor of the Exchequer said , to offset suggestions that the costs of the war could be raised by further taxing the rich . Since that was impossible , he continued , he must turn to " articles in common consumption which lend themselves to my purpose without in any way forcing me to impinge upon veartime necessities of life . " " There are a small number of important customs and excise taxes which for years have stood up against any strain put upon them and which at present are proving very lucrative , " he said . " They are commodities which a very large number of people desire to enjoy , but I must help through taxation my colleagues who are trying to keep demand and supply in better equilibrium . " Thus did Sir Kingsley introduce his proposed new taxes on beer , wine , whisky and tobacco , which , despite already heavy imposts and shortages , are in greater demand now than before the war . The Chancellor of the Exchequer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said that his proposed increase of 2d a pint in taxation would bring in ? 48,000 , - 000 in new revenues in a full year . The consumption of tobacco , he said , is no higher than before the war . He estimated that ? 340,000 , - 000 a year would be spent on it . Members of the forces , he said , will be able to buy limited quantities of pipe tobacco and cigarettes at the old prices . Issues White Papers The Chancellor of the Exchequer followed the precedent established last year by issuing with his financial statement a White Paper analyzing the sources of war finance and giving estimates of the national income and expenditures in the year 1938 , the last complete year before the war , and in 1940 and 1941 . Another White Paper set out facts relative to the taxation of weekly wage earners , which are subject to considerable debate . From all these it was clear that expenditures in the coming fiscal year are estimated at ? 5,286,000 , - 000 , an increase of ? 510,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for war materials supplied under the United States lease-lend agreement . The grand total the Chance:lor of the Exchequer put at about ? 6,500,000,000 , against less than ? 4,000,000,000 in 1940-41 and ? 5,500,000,000 in 1941-42 . Allowing for non-budgetary receipts , including the sale of foreign investments and contributions from Canada , he took ? 4,500,000,000 as the amount to be provided by votes of credit . He is budgeting for revenues from taxation of ? 2,400,000 , - 000 , or about ? 150,000,000 more than the estimated yield of existing taxes , leaving the balance to be covered by loans and savings . Instead of adding to the worries of the income taxpayer , Sir Kingsley went a considerable distance toward allaying them . There would be simpler forms provided , he promised , but , even more important , he declared that every taxpayer would receive a certificate showing the amount of post-war credit he had built up by his tax payments , with the assurance that it was his absolute property and could not be drawn upon by the government to cover arrears for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tax Similarly , business firms paying the excess profits tax will have statutory right to their 20 per cent post-war credit rebate , subject to the express condition that it is not to be used to provide bonuses for shareholders but to meet the needs of industrial revival in peacetime . This consideration led the Chancellor of the Exchequer to warn the nation that it must not expect a complete relaxation of controls latter the war was over , emphasizing the need of regulating the release of pent-up demands that will begin when peace is established at a rate appropriate to a high level of steady employment . While women were hit hard by the increases in luxury taxes , married women received a consolation in substantial increases of income tax allowances on their income from war work and Sir Kingsley made other concessions to wageearners , for whom the basic figure lbefore the tax can be deducted has been substantially increased . Generally , the recommendations were well received by the House of Commons , which cheered infrequently , however . The members applauded Sir Kingsley 's expression of gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under lease-lend , which , he said , was now running at the rate of about 2100,000,000 monthly . He said the United Kingdom had received about ? 600,000 , - 000 up to March 31 . A large percentage , he said , probably would henceforth be sent to India and the dominions . He expressed gratitude , too , to Canada , which , he said , had sent ? 1,000,000,000 worth of supplies free to the Motherland.
