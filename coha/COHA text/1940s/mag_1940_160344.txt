Under the impression that the election was over , citizens of the U. S. last week prepared to give their ears a rest , prop up their feet , pay overdue attention to comic strips , football scores , fashion advertisements . But another campaign was on . A great shout was heard from leaders in both parties : " Unity ! " Blared on the radio , blazoned in headlines were appeals , some frantic , some cool-praying that the U. S. should unite behind the President in order that the perils of the future be met in strength . " Good losers ' ' clubs were formed , meetings were held , petitions urging this- &-that; were sent here- &-there.; <P> Franklin D. Roosevelt had made no postelection appeal for unity in his support , perhaps reserving his views for a major occasion . In a telegram to Also-Ran Roger W. Babson , he had welcomed " cooperation " of all citizens . Also-Ran Wendell Willkie now urged unity , but also alert and vigilant opposition ( see p. 18 ) . <P> Democrats feared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political-minded President . Upshot of concern over the spread and depth of these fears was a public meeting at New York 's Carnegie Hall , staged by the non-partisan Council for Democracy . In stage-Lincoln voice , Actor Raymond Massey read a unity plea by Poet Stephen Vincent Benet . Unity speeches were made by Attorney General Robert H. Jackson , Selective Service Director Clarence A. Dykstra , Columnist Dorothy Thompson , Labor Leader George M. Harrison , Industrialist Howard Coonley , Newscaster Raymond Gram Swing , Citizen Alfred Mossman Landon . <P> ( " Only non-unity note of the evening , " said the New York Times , " was struck by the audience , a section of which booed when a telegram was read . . . signed by General Hugh S. Johnson . " ) <P> To one great segment of the U. S. , all this to-do undoubtedly seemed as unnecessary and embarrassing as French generals kissing . Many U. S. citizens , perhaps more than belong to any other group , are of a kind whom everyone has encountered : they do not protest their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They vote , pay taxes and , if need be , march . For a week or two before elections they may get politically het up . But after an election is past , they quickly return to their normal attitude , which is both affectionate and aloof . Sure , they are for the President-he is their President , is n't he ? - and of course they will still make up their own minds whether they like him and what he does . <P> Doubtless with these citizens in mind.General John J. Pershing last week said clearly and simply : " That the people will now unite behind the new President does not admit of doubt . It is the American way . " <P> But people who had fears for national unity were obviously not talking sheer fantasy . The citizens whose undemonstrative loyalty to the President can be taken for granted are those who do not take their politics hard . Franklin Roosevelt is among those who in recent years have inspired citizens to take their politics hard.And among several groups who have taken their politics harder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the New Deal and the temperament of Franklin Roosevelt .
