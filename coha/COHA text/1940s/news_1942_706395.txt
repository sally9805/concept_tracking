M. yesterday , the second day of the fourth selective service registration . Today , the third and last day of the registration , the city 's 280 local boards will remain open from 7 A. M. to 9 P. M. in order to give every one who is liable for registration but has not yet enrolled ample opportunity to do so . With Saturday 's total of 269,102 , yesterday 's registration brought the number listed here to 588,752 . The totals for each day , by boroughs , follow : Manhattan ?

Although local Selective Service officials originally predicted a total enrollment of 900,000 in this city , yesterday 's enrollment was below their expectations . Consequently they were inclined to believe that the final total for the three-day period might be closer to 800,000 than 900,000 when it is computed tonight . in the United States as a whole , the registration is expected to cover 13,589,800 men , on the basis of calculations made by the Census Bureau from statistics of the 1940 census . Among those expected to register today is President Roosevelt , whose local board plans to call upon him in the White House this morning .

An army of 50,000 workers , including 5,000 paid personnel of the Selective Service system , and 45 , - 000 volunteers , took part in the vast work . of registration here . Colonel Arthur V. , local director of Selective Service , praised their efficiency and cowtesy highly . So well did the organization function that the final total of the day 's registration was computed at Selective Service Headquarters at 6:59 P. M. This was considerably less than an ? hour after many boards had closed their registrations , since they were required to register every one who was in line by 6 P. M. Throughout the day flying squads of reserve registrars were dispatched from the Selective Service headquarters at 1 East Fortyfourth Street , as local boards advised the officials of the need for extra help . In all more than 700 reserve registrars were sent out in response to appeals from more than sixty-five local boards . In most cases they went in buses , which upon arrival at congested registration places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics unduly long lines of would-be registrants were usually quickly reduced to reasonable lengths . A. survey of a number of registration places selected at random indicated that the average waiting time ran . about an hour in midafternoon . However , every one seemed cheerful and good-natured as the lines moved slowly ahead into the vacant stores , school houses and fire houses that served as registration places . Fifteen interpreters also were sent out from the Selective Service headquarters to cope with unexpected linguistic difficulties , while couriers of the American Women 's Voluntary Services kept moving in and out of the headquarters all afternoon bearing messages to and from local boards . Colonel broadcast instructions to the registration officials every hour over the municipal radio station WNYC . At 12:45 P. M. he authorized as many local boards as were ready to do so to start registration immediately , without waiting for the technical opening time of 1 P. M.

Although in general each draft board is supposed to cover an area of 25,000 persons , there were bound to be inequalities in laying out the districts . Consequently Selective Service headquarters had expected congestion might arisedat certain registration places , notably those of Local Board 20 at 389 Madison Avenue and Local Board 31 in the Hotel Delmonico , Park Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street . By noon a line of 200 had formed outside the registration place of Local Board 31 , and officials ordered the twenty-five registrars who were on duty to start enrolling the men . There were more than 400 men in line at Local Board 13 , 381 Fourth Avenue , while lines half a block long or longer were not uncommon at other registration centers . When Local Board 20 appeared in danger of being swamped , three motor buses , each manned by ten deputy registrars , came to its assistance from headquarters and soon stabilized the situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reduced to a small fraction of its earlier dimensions . The men who registered yesterday are not liable , under the present law , for combat service , but they are to receive later a threepage questionnaire intended to provide information on their skills and experience . Paul V. , chairman of the War Man Power Commission , has described the registration as an " occupational census " intended to make possible " accurate and practical budgeting of the nation 's man power . " The former German consul general in New York who registered yesterday was , Dr. Paul Peter Schwarz , 60 years old , of 230 Central Park South , who served in that capacity from 1929 until April , 1933 , when he registered in protest against the Hitler regime . He said he would " gladly go into any kind of service against Hitler . " " The registration shows the determination or the American peo-1 ple to keep alive and to be pre-1 pared to die , if necessary , to main-1 tain our democratic standards , " said Dr. Schwarz , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heading a line of more.than 500 waiting to register with Local Board 1 in Public School 23 , at Bayard and Mulberry Streets , was Burnet Kavanagh , 59 , a blind newsdealer , of 10 Monro Street . " They were swell to me , " he said , referring to those waiting With him , " I guess I was pretty far back when I came into line an hour ago , but every one hustled me up to the front . " Mr. Kavanagh said he thought the blind might be able to make some contribution to the war effort . " You know our hearing is better than most people 's , " he said , " and there must be some spot for us in this war . " Giovanni di Vincenzo , a barber of 38 Grand Street , who came to the United States thirty - eight years ago , was outspoken in his opinion of the Axis . " Mussolini phooey , he should be slapped down , " Mr. di Vincenzo said as he waited in the same line . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fellow Mussolini . Boy , would I like to have him come to my barber shop for a shave ! " Yet another registrant at Local Board 1 was Leonard Marsh , a 48-year-old seaman of 25 South Street , who told reporters he had just come back from a trip to Iceland on a merchant ship , and that he was in Suez at a time when the Germans bombed it every other night for three weeks . William M. Chadbourne , president of the National Republican Club and one of the men who helped draft the Burke-Wadsworth bill that later became the Selective Service Act , registered with Local Board 31 . Mr. Chadbourne , a 63-year-old lawyer , who lives at 550 Park Avenue , was a major attached to General Headquarters in France in the last war . " This is an unusual pleasure for me because I helped to draft the Burke-Wadsworth bill in- which selective service age limits were originally fixed from 20 to 65 , " Mr. Chadbourne said . He explained that while Congress cut the age limits to 21 to 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits last year . A striking example of the way the registration cut across lines of occupation and social standing was evident at Local Board 31 . Within a few minutes that board registered Robert Goelet , 62-year-old banker , who gave his address as Webster Street , Newport , R. I. ; Matthew Sheeran , 54 , of 163 East Fifty-second Street , who proudly showed a picture of his son , Peter , an Army private ; Traffic Patrolman Thomas J. , 60 , of 455 East 143d Street and Emil Schram , 48 , president of the New York Stock Exchange . Elsewhere in the city and its environs the registration went along in much the same smooth , cheery fashion that marked it in Manhattan . In New Jersey a spokesman for Lieut . Col. Edgar N. Bloomer , acting State draft director , expressed belief that 70 to 75 per cent of the men in the 45-64 age group had registered when the boards closed at 5 P. M.
