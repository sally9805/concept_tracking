And now they trade me down the river for a couple of left-handed bums who 've won one game between them . . . . " <P> Bobo Newsom was right . He was the Dodgers ' best pitcher . But the Old Showboat 's arrogance got Manager Leo ( " Lippy " ) Durocher 's goat . When it came to a showdown last week-after Bobo 's suspension for insubordination had caused a brief " sympathy strike " among his teammates-Dodger Boss Branch Rickey upheld Durocher .

Within the past fortnight the Army had rejected three of the Brownies ' best players : slugging Shortstop Vernon Stephens , fancy-fielding First Baseman George McQuinn and first-string Catcher Frank Hayes . <P> Stephens , the Sisler of this year 's outfit , was leading the American League last week with a batting average of .336 and a total of 13 home runs . Close behind was another power-hitting Brownie , Outfielder Chester Laabs ( eleven homers ) . Assured of this one-two punch for the remainder of the season , the Little Brownies can fight it out with the Tigers , Senators , White Sox-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
