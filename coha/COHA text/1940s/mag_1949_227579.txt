After 21,500 miles of flying , and four weeks of interviews , the 13 correspondents in the U.S. press party were too tired even to play poker . Homeward-bound on the KLM ( Royal Dutch Airlines ) Constellation Franeker , they were in no mood for the kind of horseplay that had brightened an earlier leg of their Indonesian tour , when Nat Barrows of the Chicago Daily News whipped out some scissors and trimmed the luxuriant locks of the Houston Post 's James Branyan , while two other newsmen held him down . <P> On the way out in another KLM Constellation , * they had sat out the ordeal of a dangerous , 3,200-mile over-water flight , made necessary by India 's pro-Indonesian ban on landings by Dutch aircraft . For the trip back , Foreign Editor Charles Gratke of the Christian Science Monitor cabled Prime Minister Pandit Nehru and got permission for the newsmen to stop at Calcutta and Bombay , with a side jog north to New Delhi . At the Indian capital , they found Nehru too busy for a press conference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kashmir shawls to take home to their wives , teakwood boats for their children . That evening they dug out their last clean shirts for cocktails with U.S. Ambassador Loy Henderson . <P> Henderson , who knew many of the newsmen from the days when he ran the State Department 's Near East desk , talked over old times with the New York Times 's Bertram Hulen ( veteran of 23 years on the State Department beat ) , TIME 'S Jack Werkley , Business Week 's Thomas Falco , WOR 's Pulitzer-prizewinning H. R. Knickerbocker . <P> Next morning the correspondents got up early for a 6 a.m. takeoff . Heading southwest for Bombay , the Franeker had 32 crewmen and passengers aboard , besides the 13 correspondents. ** <P> Three hours later , rocking through the driving rain and ghostlike clouds of a monsoon storm , Captain Chris van der Vaart , one of KLM 's most experienced pilots , nosed down . When the plane broke through the murk , they could glimpse the sea and the approaches of Bombay 's Santa Cruz airport . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane was again swallowed by the low-hanging mists . Suddenly its left wing brushed a hidden , tree-covered , 674-foot hill , ripped along its slope as the pilot frantically tried to gain altitude . Some 20 feet from the top , the Franeker 's nose plunged into the ground and the Constellation blew to bits with Van der Vaart 's severed hand still on the controls . All 45 passengers were killed . It was the worst aviation disaster in India 's history . <P> As the U.S. press spread the news of its family tragedy in black headlines , Ambassador Henderson had the task of identifying the bodies of his night-before guests . Most of their faces were readily recognizable , their expressions calm , as if death had come with merciful suddenness . <P> From boyhood , handsome , wry John Gerard ( Jack ) Werkley wanted to be a reporter .
