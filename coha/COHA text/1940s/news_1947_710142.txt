txt The Jewish Agency for Palestine refused today to cooperate with the Government in tracking down terrorists if it meant turning the entire community into informers , an agency official said plainly while the army was preparing for any emergency . The agency , vi-ich has repeatedly appealed to terrorists through the press to cease their activities , is willing to cooperate to a certain extent but declines without reservation to go to the length asked by the Government . Its attitude has not helped the general situation , which is bordering on a war of nerves . Despite repeated protests , thel mass evacuation of British women and children from Palestine began ' today by air . Elaborate plans have been perfected by the army to move some 2,000 in the face of imminent statutory martial law . Most to Go to Britain It appears certain in that the great majority will go to the United Kingdom as part of the army 's plan to reduce its responsibility here in the event of open warfare with the terrorists . Few people here , especially American officials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asked whether they wanted to leave , but it was left to their own discretion . Mrs. Golda Meyerson , head of the Jewish Agency 's political department said today that the agency had been asked several times to cooperate with the British . " But , " she added , " I am sorry to say that evidently the Government understands cooperation in such a way that we have not been able to accede to their request . What they expect of us is that we shall all become informers . It is not a happy task for the agency or the Vaad Leumi Jewish national council and is one we have had to refuse . " Asked what alternative there was , Mrs. Meyerson declared : " What the Vaad Leumi has decided to do is much more difficult than merely becoming informers . We have refused to plunge the Jewish community into civil war but the Vaad Leumi has adopted its resolutions and means to carry them out . The resolutions call for fighting measures to protect Jewish persons and interests against terrorist attacks . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one watching his neighbor or friend and reporting what he thinks may be wrong with the person he suspects . There is no way in which an individual can know who is a terrorist and where he can be found . " Denies Contact With Terrorists Mrs. Meyerson said the agency had no contact with the terrorists and could appeal to them only through the press , . public statements and public opinion . The only concession she made on informers was when asked whether she thought the persons who saw Judge Ralph Windham kidnapped from his court in Tel Aviv should - have informed the police if they I recognized any of the abductors . She answered : " If someone did see it , he should have informed the police . " Hundreds witnessed the abduction , but there were no informers . The Agency , Mrs. Meyerson said , was sorry that the Government had found it necessary to evacuate British women and children . She declared : " In its official statement they say that it is necessary to do so because of the steps it wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , then we can get an inkling of how terrorism will be put down . " If it is to create the impression in the world that the lives of British women and children are not safe , we resent this and do not think it correct . We are convinced they can be as safe here as anywhere else in the world . " She added that , this was a time for wise statesmanship and administration // and not for the application of a " strong hand . " But tension-continued here . Few people circulate at night , although there is yet no curfew , and those who go out walk in pairs or threes . Whole sections of Jerusalem are being cordoned as compounds and more barbed wire is appearing daily . One section being wired in is Rehavia , which is primarily Jewish . It appears that many resiI dents will be asked to leave and their homes will be requisitioned . On the outer fringe is the home of Lieut . Gen. Sir Evelyn Barker , British commander here , and also the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today and asked : " Are we being wired in or wired out ? " No decision has yet been reached .
