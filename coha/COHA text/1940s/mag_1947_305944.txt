The annual Christmas rush had an atmosphere which shoppers had not sniffed since before Pearl Harbor . <P> During the last six years , many a customer had become a prey to the demoralizing phobia that clerks would refuse to take his money unless he were polite . But last week , almost every big department store was doing its utmost to revive half-forgotten reputations for courtesy . <P> Atlanta 's Davison-Paxon store sent its customers dollar bills and asked that they be awarded to courteous clerks . In Seattle , Frederick &; Nelson kept a company spy prowling the aisles . His job : giving orchids to polite salesgirls . The help , apparently a little stunned by such thoughtful practices , was positively charming . <P> The customer acted differently , too .

Actually , the nation was in the throes of the greatest dollar-volume buying spree in history . In Manhattan one day last week , Macy 's sold $1,400,000 worth of merchandise-an alltime record- and smugly decided to quit publicizing million-dollar days .

Many attempted to solve the dilemma by taking extra-expensive articles in the hope of getting quality goods . <P> In Manhattan , Gimbels was doing a good business in grand pianos and $4,000 mink coats . Cartier was having no trouble selling superexpensive jewelry . Example : a three-strand diamond necklace with matching earrings for $29,000 . Capehart de luxe record players were in demand at $1,595 .

The way I figure , Harry 's paycheck is worth half of what it was eight years ago . So when the salesgirl tells me how much something costs , I just divide it in two in my head . That way , I do n't feel so bad . . . . "
