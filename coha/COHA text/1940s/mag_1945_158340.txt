For 33 long years the citizens of Ismail , Bessarabian city on the lower Danube , have shared a suppressed desire . In 1912 they ordered a statue of Catherine the Great 's famed General Suvorov , Russian hero who liberated the city from the Turks . In nearby Odessa a suitable equestrian statue of the general was made , and was ready for shipment when World War I broke out . When that war was finished , Ismail was no longer part of the Russian Empire , and the new Red Russia was not interested in the memory of Tsarist heroes . <P> The bronze General , lying on his side , bided his time in an Odessa cellar . Last week , with Ismail again Russian and Russia again interested in its heroes of the past , the General was hoisted out of his hideout , dusted off and readied for his 120-mile journey to Ismail 's public square .
