txt Wireless to me NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , Monday , April ** Royal Air Force followed a heavy raid on Rostock Saturday night for the third night in a row , combined with an attack on the Skoda arms plant at Pilsen , with a day-long offensive against the railway stations and yards at Hazebrouck and St. Omer in occupied France yesterday . Again the daylight operations met comparatively little Nazi air defense , although Squadron Leader Brendan ( Paddy ) Finucane added another to the string of German planes he is credited with having shot down , bringing his total to thirty-one . British bombers continued the raiding in Germany last night , officials reported early today . The R. ' A. F. 's battering of the German Baltic base of Rostock again , with a total of about 600 tons of ? explosives dropped there in the three nights , must have left that city in ruins , it is believed . For the ? second night British pilots reported fires started the previous night had lighted them to the target . The Rostock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those on the two preceding nights . The raid on the Skoda works was carried out by four-motored Stirlings . This was a long raid , involving a flight across France and Germany and return of about 1,400 miles . The Skoda works , ? which has been reported as currently operating only 40 per cent efficiently because of sabotage by the workers , who are under armed Nazi guard , had been bombed twice before by the R. A. F. Both previous attacks were by light forces of bombers . The latest raid was believed to have been far heavier in the number of planes involved and weight of explosives dropped . German Bombers Strike Back Also , Saturday night , while German bombers were over England in an attack on Bath , British medium bombers of the night fighter force attacked the German airfields in Northern France , dropping explosives and setting fires . German raiders showered heavy explosive and fire bombs on the west of England early today , carrying out Adolf Hitler 's reiterated threat of reprisal attacks , The Associated Press reported from London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazis came in singly to unload their cargoes to the light of flares dropped by pilot planes . At the end of a week that involved some of the heaviest daylight and rirght offensives the R. A. F. had ever undertaken , the score of planes lost over France , Germany and the Middle East was unofficially recorded as sixty-seven by the Axis against fifty-four by the R. A. F. These did not include five bombers lost by Britain in the Saturday night-Sunday operations . Axis losses were listed as eight over Britain , fourteen over Western Europe and forty-five in the Middle East . , The R. A. F. lost forty-one planes in Western Europe and thirteen in the Middle East . In each instance the heaviest losses were sustained by the side maintaining the offensive , as the figures include the continuing Axis attacks on Malta . The bombing sweeps carried out by the R. A. F. with many Bostons escorted by high-flying Spitfires , were in three stages , beginning soon after dawn and continuing until dark . Although more than once Spitfire pilots reported having seen Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty planes , since the primary purpose of a fighter escort is to keep the bombers guarded , they waited mostly in vain for the Germans to attack . An exception was Flight Lieutenant Finucane 's squadron , which he led into a formation of twenty Fock-Wulf 190s . He knocked down one of the Nazi planes . Another fell in the fire of a young New Zealand pilot . Under such protection the Boston bombers ran up to their targets virtually unhindered . Fighter pilots overhead reported that they saw bomb after bomb hit squarely . The daylight action carried on the ' round-the-clock offensive that the growing strength of the R. A. F. and good weather is making possible . It began at about the time the night bombers were returning from their long hops . Nazi Raid on Bath Is Heavy The R. A. F. 's persistent attacks on German cities have stung the Nazis into retaliation . More " reprisal " raids may be expected , but for the beginning the German Air Fleet selected Bath , a west of England city of dignified Georgian squares that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has little or no industry and is populated to a large extent by invalids and evacuees . The Saturday night raid there was the heaviest to which any British city has been subjected recently . Taking advantage of a waxing moon , the Nazi bombers roared in low , dumping their missiles haphazardly over the city , which is known chiefly as an inland watering place . Many bombs fell on churches , historic buildings , shelters and private homes . The Nazi fliers also pumped machine-gun bullets at anything within their range . Casualties were reported heavy and those made homeless so numerous the government opened rest centers to house them . Some of the Bath casualties occurred in a. shelter opposite a movie house , which was damaged . Among the victims was Mrs. J. L. Langworthy , former Mayoress of , Bath . The attack on Bath was but one of several enemy raids during the night , in which the Nazis lost five planes . Places from the south coast to Northeast Scotland were bombed . Bombs dropped on another town in Southwest England killed three persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early in the morning Nazi raiders appeared over Southeast England , dropping bombs and machinegunning the countryside on their way back to France .
