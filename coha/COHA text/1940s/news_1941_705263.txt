WASHINGTON , Jan. 2 ? The Army prepared today to ask the new Congress for an additional $3,000,000,000 to further its armament program . The amounts to be asked after the new session opens tomorrow were reported to be as follows : $1,000,000,000 for the production of 3,600 more bombing planes from parts made largely in existing automobile factories and assembled in four Midwestern plants operated by aircraft companies . $1,600,000,000 for guns , tanks , planes and other materiel to round out equipment for an Army of 2,000 , - 000 men . $400,000,000 for the construction of additional munitions plants to give the country sufficient reserve capacity to supply land forces of 4,000,000 men in an emergency .

These new plants would be in addition to the eighty-four factories or special facilities provided for under the $800,000,000 appropriation which Congress voted for the purpose last Summer . Billions Already Obligated Roughly 75 per cent of the total of $6,600,000,000 appropriated for the Army last year has been obligated to date and , in so far as new munitions facilities are concerned , all but 5 per cent of available funds are obligated .

This assertion led to talk in government circles that several hundred fighter // ARMY PLANS TO ASK $3,000,000,000 MORE // planes might be released to China in the Spring .
