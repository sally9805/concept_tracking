A small boy and two little girls stopped to eye the man in the grey Hamburg and blue . overcoat and he struck up a conversation . <P> Where were they from , he asked . From Washington . And where was he from ? From Canada . " Is n't it cold up there ? " asked the boy . " Yes , " answered the P.M. , " but I imagine that today it 's just about like this .

While this is an ever-present danger , the menace to freedom comes as well from sinister plans to undermine the structure of government within the border of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only by military force but by an organized conspiracy to establish a tyranny over the human mind , to thwart the wills and destroy the souls of nations as well as of men . ... A way must be found , and that speedily , to ensure that nations which are still free will not be suborned , defeated or destroyed one by one . "
