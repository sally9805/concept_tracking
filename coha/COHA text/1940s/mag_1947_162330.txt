Cal Tech was taking no chances with the world 's most precious piece of glass . As it dared the perils of Southern California highways last week , the 200-inch mirror for the giant Mt . Palomar telescope , 160 miles away , was insured with Lloyd 's for $600,000 and was escorted by 15 cops . <P> Starting time ( 3:30 a.m. from Pasadena ) was concealed from the public as if the mirror 's last move were a military offensive . The specially strengthened trailer , weighing 60 tons with the mirror and its wooden case , moved at five to ten miles an hour . At first the roadsides were empty , but as the news traveled , crowds began to gather . At Irvine , near Santa Ana , a star-minded school principal lined up his pupils to watch the parade pass . <P> Far ahead , road crews strengthened bridges and culverts . The trailer crept over them carefully , while a vibration meter-connected with a microphone inside the case-reported each tremor of the mirror . But the driver needed no admonition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's latest bright hope of understanding the universe was riding behind his truck . <P> The mirror spent the night in the little ranch town of Escondido , which was all agog at the honor . At 5 a.m. it began the last lap , up the twisting road to mile-high Mt . Palomar . The pace slowed to a crawl as two trucks pushed the trailer . <P> Near Mt . Palomar 's forested upper slopes thick fog drifted over the road and hail hissed out of the clouds . The three trucks groped through it fearfully , for a skid might have rolled both trucks and mirror down the steep mountainside . Then , as the mirror neared the observatory dome-shining like frosted silver and big as a railroad roundhouse-a shaft of brilliant sunlight broke through the clouds . The nearest star , the sun , was friendly . <P> The astronomers , engineers and technicians thanked all the stars as they watched the mirror backed into the observatory . The case was opened . A crane lifted the precious freight over the threshold of the chamber under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its massive supports , was waiting .
