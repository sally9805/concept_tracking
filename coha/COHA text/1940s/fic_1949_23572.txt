The Kiss , the Tree , and the Bullet A Story by Lael Tucker Drawings by Bernarda Bryson A NDALUSTA is a medium small , middle-aged town , south of Oglethorpe , which is a medium big and very old town , and north of Marianna , which is a medium big , new town . It lies between a slow-moving , thick , chocolate-colored river and a main-line railroad . It has a number of pre  --  Civil War families of both colors , several very pretty residential streets , an adequate shopping district , and several industries which reached their peak during World War I. Its one big , fantastically ugly hotel , the Andalusia House , was built in 1890 and is now avoided by anyone who can possibly stay at The Oaks , which is an expensive resort hotel for **26;949;TOOLONG five miles outside of town . In some ways , Andalusia is quite modern . Its women drink , smoke , and go naked at the midriff . In other ways , it is old fashioned . The leading families are a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit themselves . The whole town knew , for example , that Lucy Nettleton had poisoned her poisonous old mother , but they also understood why , and nothing happened to Lucy . The daughters of the leading families , defined now roughly as those who appear daily in the Society Column of the Andalusia Banner , do not go to work . Also , , they marry with , and not without , their parents consent . A NGELA put her brush down and got up from her dressing table . She tacked aimlessly across the wide , bare-boarded floor of her room as if propelled by an inadequate breeze . When she reached the open window , she rested her palms on the sill and leaned out into the soft , sunshiny day . It was a beautiful day , all right . It was an entirely suitable day for ' a wedding . In the back-yard , the water oak trembled with a green , a refurbished , springtime youth . A thousand gray beards nodded as if from sun-warmed rocking chairs on the great ancient branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen bright papery colors . Pinkney said it was a good-luck sign when your wedding day was a fine , fancy day like today . Angela wondered . She tried to total the score on her friends , but the memories of their marriages blurred softly in her mind . At any rate , it had rained the day Carrie and the doctor were married , and they were certainly happy . Pinkney bustled out of the kitchen door to the back porch , followed inevitably by the slam of the kitchen screen . From the porch steps he threw the water from the dish pan in a long arc so that it fell along a stretch of earth , bare of grass and smelling faintly of the amount of dirty water it had already absorbed . He looked up and saw her . " Miss Angela , " he said in a scandalized baritone . " Anybody could see you , anybody commn ' up the alley . Just anybody . " The alley ran behind the wooden fence in back of their house . It was almost invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and dripping with moss . People said it was a shame that this ancient avenue of trees shaded such a muddy little alley lined with Negro shacks . Angela was sure that none of the Negroes were passing now , in the warm afternoon sunshine , and that they could not see her if they were . Still she was dressed only in her slip and she drew in from the window . " Mama told you not to throw that water so near the house any more , " she called back from within the room , in retaliation , but without animosity . Mama should have the sink drain fixed , she thought , frowning . " Angelah ! " Her mother 's voice took the stairs in a practiced curve . Angela did not stir . Mama had promised to leave her entirely alone while she dressed . " Certainly , dear , " she had agreed , looking injured . " But if you need my help , just call . " Mama had lingered . " Just think . After this afternoon , I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . It had been an exhausted topic . Angela stared at the open window that framed the perfect day . It would be a perfect night , too , clear and moonlit . It would be a good night for a chivaree . She clasped her hands and twisted them . The chivaree was one of the strongest and , she thought now , the ugliest , of the town 's traditions . Ral had promised her that she and he would escape somehow . She did not think that she could live through it if she and Ral were victims of that ghastly gaiety , the lewd and public underlining of their wedding night . Too much of their lives and their love had been conducted in the opaque , distorting goldfish bowl of the town 's avid curiosity . Too many people knew that old Mr. Raleigh had once called Angela 's mother poor white trash and forbidden his son to love or to marry Angela Madison . They knew , too , that her mother had turned Mr. Raleigh 's young son out of the house more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for nothing piney woods shoat ! " They knew of the accident on the day when she and Ral had defied the deepest canons of behavior in Andalusia and had set out to be married in Marianna without their parents ' consent . They knew the circumstances , the reasons , even the dialogue , diversely reported , when the Raleighs and the Madisons had finally agreed to the marriage . The Raleighs and the Madisons had discussed and justified themselves as intensively as they were discussed . Now , if she and Ral were to be placarded in the public square and even the veriest strangers made aware that this was , at last , their nuptial night , she could not stand it . I want to be married to Ral in the full sight of God and the whole of Andalusia , she thought , and then I want to go away with him quickly and privately and never come back . I want to go where no one knows whether Ral and I have been married a day or a week or years and never see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not even , she thought fiercely , her two best friends , Carrie and Marilyn Lee . There was a restrained knock on her door like a voice toned down to a whisper . " Oh , come in , " said Angela testily . She sat down at her dressing table and bent down her head so that her shoulder length , fair hair fell forward . She fumbled for her brush and began brushing her hair vigorously from roots to tips . Mrs. Madison came on semi-tiptoe into the room . She was panting a little from the stairs . - It 's Carrie , " said Mrs. Madison in a loud whisper . " She says she came over to help the bride . I told her you did n't even want your mama in this precious hour before you go to the altar , but she said to ask you anyway . " " You send her ' on up , " said Angela . " I do n't want to hurt her feelings . " She wanted Carrie to be with her now . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marilyn Lee . The three of them were bound together by curious and indissoluble ties and strange , youthful intricacies of understanding , by entangled , if tangent fates . But she did not want her mother to be with her . " You are so very sweet and thoughtful , Angela , " said Mrs. Madison . " You certainly will make Ralston happy . " One thing you had to say for Mama . Once she gave in , she gave in all over . You would think Ral was the King of Sheba now , to hear her talk . After the horrible accumulation of things she had said about Ral , her words were honey now . Mrs. Madison went out and called over the bannisters , throwing her voice downward like a thin , weighted fishing line . " Come on up , Carrie ! " She came back to the door of her daughter 's room . " You 'll be good , darling ? " Angela nodded . She was still brushing her hair upside down and her eyes were closed . S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature of a walk . Her good leg hit with a thump that counterbalanced the tentative scrape of the leg she was saving . Not all the Gregory money had sufficed to overcome the effects of infantile paralysis , and Carrie walked on one and three-quarters legs and the rest of her body was violently misshapen thereby . Angela was so accustomed to her that it was only when she saw a stranger look at Carrie that she realized afresh that Carrie was a cripple . Or at moments like this , unduly sensitized moments when everything familiar took on strange dimensions . " Hi , toots , " said Carrie in her pretty voice . " Hello , honey , " said Angela through her hair . Mrs. Madison hesitated near the door . THE KISS , THE TREE Angela and Carrie said nothing more . Their silence was respectful and tranquil . " I 'm really glad you are here , Carrie , " said Mrs. Madison fussily . " Angela is nervous as a -- as a bride . " She laughed , her constant and rather charming laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wo n't you , Carrie ? " she said , as she went out . Angela threw back her hair and straightened up . She and Carrie exchanged amused and cynical glances . Carrie closed the door . " How do you feel , sweetie ? " Carrie asked . " I du n no . Funny . How did you feel ? " " Well , it was different , " said Carrie . It was different for Carrie and so much simpler . Doctor Brown had courted Carrie in the privacy of her father 's sick-room . The doctor had been new to the town , but he had come there from Marianna with a fine reputation . After Carrie 's father died , Carrie 's mother had been ill , and Doctor Brown 's visits continued . Even the town 's inordinately sensitive antennae had failed to detect romance . The doctor was a relatively attractive man , and Carrie was firmly destined in the collective town mind to be an old maid . She had lost her only chance , they said , when her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned was really after the Gregory money and not Carrie , who loved him . Carrie had taken to steady and controlled drinking after that until her face had grown sullenly misshapen . But the doctor was scornful of the body whose flaws he under stood too well , and as he watched Carrie nurse her beloved parents , he came to understand the luminous resistance of her spirit and to love her . Carrie had waited a decorous six months after her father died and then she and Doctor Brown had been privately and decorously married . The town had been surprised . " I wish we could do it , like you did , " said Angela wistfully . " This public fuss is gruesome . But gruesome . " " We were lucky , my being in mourning , " said Carrie . Carrie was still in semi-mourning . Her black and white voile dress was correct by the town 's rigid conventions , but it was becoming . " There are even orange blossoms on my veil , " said Angela , throwing her hands upward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thinks they are -- cute . " " That reminds me , " said Carrie . " If you need anything  --  you know  --  I can get it for you . Jack 's being a doctor makes it easy . " " Well , I think go right ahead and have a baby , " said Angela . " Why not ? Anyway I know all about it . " " You do ? " said Carrie . " Oh , honey , you know Ral . He would have been sure to get really tangled up with some other girl if I 'd been too -- mean . " " Why , Angela , " said Carrie , half shocked , half mocking . Then she added thoughtfully . " You 're a cozy one , you are . I never was sure . " " You or anybody else -- except Ral , " said Angela with real satisfaction . " This is a hell of a conversation just before your wedding ! Ca n't I help you dress ? " " Make me look pretty as a picture ? " Angela looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile accident still lay like a welt across her cheek . The smaller scars added a separate network to the frown lines in her Morehead . The circles under her eyes were too dark to cover with powder . She was really drinking much too much . " Let 's have a cigarette first . " She offered her package to Carrie . " This is eight , " said Carrie , taking a cigarette . " I only smoke ten a day these days . " " Jack has certainly wrought wonders ! " said Angela . She lit her own cigarette . Her hand was shaking a little . " Have you heard from Ral since last night ? " asked Carrie . Jack said the dinner was super . " " Ral said even your precious Jack got tight , " said Angela with a touch of malice . " And Sonny Boy decided he was Salome and did the dance of the seven veils . He even took off his underpants . " They both laughed , easily and gayly . " Here  --  let me work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEN Angela 's mother came in at a quarter to four , Angela was almost ready . Her long , sheath-like dress of brocaded satin was hooked up to its lace turnover collar . Carrie had succeeded in fluffing Angela 's soft hair until it curled softly away from her face and fell neatly and softly to her shoulders . She was pinning the Madison family veil of white lace into place . Angela 's face was carefully powdered over so that the scars scarcely showed and her lack of color was disguised by neatly applied rouge . " Why , baby , you look just perfectly lovely , " said Mrs. Madison . " Does n't she ? " said Carrie . " Like a bride ! " Mrs. Madison clasped her hands and gazed at her daughter . Angela took a deep puff of her cigarette . " Now do n't you go and burn a hole in your great-grandmother Madison 's veil ! " Mrs. Madison warned sharply . " No , Mama , " said Angela . The telephone rang . " That 's Ral , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He always calls me when I want him to . Always , always , always . " " Just a second till I get your veil fixed for sure , " said Carrie . Her father shouted up the stairs . " It was Ral , Angela . I told him you had no time for him right now . Who did he think he was , interrupting a bride , I told him . See you in church , he said to tell you . " " So ... come on , girls , " said Mrs. Madison , starting ahead of them out of the room . She pitched her voice for the kitchen as she reached the stair railing . " Pinkney ! " She started down the stairs . " Bring Miss Angela 's bouquet out of the icebox ! " Angela and Carrie embraced gingerly , avoiding each other 's lipstick and each other 's fresh clothes . No one waited for Carrie when she had to negotiate her leg on stairs . Angela walked sedately down the stairs behind her mother . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket watch . " Ready to give me away , Papa ? " Angela asked . " Yes , baby , " said Mr. Madison . " But reluctantly , of course . " He had been ready from the first . He was a cheerful man and a fatalist . But he had not been much help against Mama . Poor Papa . U SUALLY Angela drove , but today Mr. Madison got into the car under the wheel with Mrs. Madison beside him . Angela sat in back with her veil carefully spread on the seat . As they started off , they were solemn and self conscious . Even Mrs. Madison was quiet . MAGAZINE Angela wondered what she ought to think about as they drove down the palm-lined avenue to the Episcopal church . The undirected thoughts that were awash in her mind like Halloween apples were obviously insufficiently grave , even though relative . She had been merely wondering if the champagne would go around and whether Ral had decided on clocked or plain socks . She thought deliberately about the wedding ahead . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual society column success  --  with unusual success in the society column , she thought . After all , Marilyn Lee 's father owned the Andalusia Banner and she was Marilyn Lee 's best friend . Nothing really mattered as long as she and Ral got clean away afterward . Oh , Lord ! It was Ral who had perpetrated the most legendary outrages in the town 's spectacular tradition of wedding night outrages . He had once forged a cowbell to the bride 's dressing case that could only be removed with a blowtorch . He had cut off one couple with a hired truck and made them drive back through Andalusia while he fired his pistol in the air over their heads . He had kidnapped . Sonny Boy and kept him from his weeping bride until after midnight . Sonny Boy had been " a good sport , " but he had never quite forgiven him . Still , it was Rai who had outwitted the others when they tried to escape and it was Ral who was planning their own escape now . It would hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were caught . It was a matter of such importance to him that Angela trembled . His reputation as a failure in business , " that unreliable Raleigh boy , " was balanced and made painless by his reputation at play . He was known as original , daring and witty , able to outdrink , outsmart , and outjest the town 's young men . That and his name were the wellsprings of his pride . It was necessary to him that they should escape . As they drove past the church 's choir room door , Angela saw Ral and Sonny Boy , who was Ral 's best man , through the open door . Ral looked out at her and gave her a warm , impudent little flip of his hand . " Ready , baby ? " asked her father . His voice was tender and his look was tender and dim . Ready ? Surely she must be ready . " They 're watching the front and back II doors , " he said . " And a ladder 's no good . But listen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you before . You blab so . We 'll go out by the screen porch ! " Angela thought quickly . The only exit from the screened porch was at the front , but you could enter it from the pantry at the end of the back stairs . Ral waved his shears . " We 'll cut our way out the side and go down the alley . " It was a feasible , clever plan . " Mama will be furious , " said Angela , feeling hopeful and lighthearted . " Sure , " said Ral absently . That kind of furious did not matter . " I 've got Pop 's car hidden at Pinkney 's house . I left mine where they could find it . It 's got bells and shoes and God knows what all chained all over it . " Angela shuddered and then laughed . " You are a smart one , Ralston Raleigh , " she said . say that for you . " She slid the fresh linen dress over her head and buckled the belt . " Hurry up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She nodded . He got a glass from her bathroom and poured into it half an inch of bourbon whiskey from a pocket flask . He took a drink himself direct from the flask and patted it as he put it back on his hip . Angela swallowed the whiskey in quick sips while she adjusted her round hat that matched her dress . She checked the contents of her bag quickly and pulled on her gloves . Her heart was beating quickly . " All set , " she said . At the door , she hesitated in a panic . " Then where ? " she asked in a whisper . T HERE were only three ways to go from Andalusia : down the long , straight , shadowless road to Marianna , up the long , straight , tree-shaded road to Olgethorpe  --  or to The Oaks , which was only five miles from town Sonny Boy , pursuing them in his Cadillac with all the malice of his ancient grudge , could surely catch them . " Trust your old man , honey , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going anywhere . We are going to stay right here , at the Andalusia House , smack in the middle of town . " . Angela felt the muscles at the back of her neck relax . RaI was wonderful . What-ever his unsteady relations with the rest of the world , he was steady as a rock with her . He would take care of them both . Five minutes later , they had pulled into the back yard of the Andalusia House and Ral was shouting at the colored boy who lounged near the closed garage . He was a strange black and Ral did not attempt bribery or explanation . He issued his orders in what he meant to be a Yankee accent to let the garage boy assume that they were Northern transien ts . It was over . Not even the seemingly thunderous crash of the cut screen wire as it fell had alarmed the would-he pursuers . The huge , hideous hotel loomed as a blessed haven . They went through the back door , into the wide , dim hall . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , Ral muttered . " You have a room for Mr. and Mrs. Albright ? " " Yeah , suh , " drawled the clerk with his pimply , half familiar face . Then he looked closely at Angela . " Why Miss Madison . . . ? " " Listen , " said Ral violently , in his normal accent . " We just got married and we ' do n't MAGAZINE want anybody to know we 're here . You understand ? Not God almighty or Mrs. Madison . If anybody finds out , I 'll burn down this hotel . By God , I will . " " Good riddance , " said the clerk , unperturbed . " Sure , sub . But I ca n't take fake names . It 's illegal . " Angela rallied all her resources , even somehow in her panic , remembering the semi-stranger 's name . " My husband 's name is Ralston Raleigh from Oglethorpe , Mr. Weir , " she said primly " And I 'd be most grateful if we could be left in peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , " said Mr. Weir , leering at them conspiratorially now . " Certainly , Miss . . Mrs. Raleigh . You go on up and do n't you worry . I 'll send your bags along and you just order dinner when you feel like it . " " Right now we feel like some ice , soda water , lemon , glasses , and sugar , " said Rai still faintly belligerent . The Negro in the wire-cage elevator untilted his chair and his uniform cap and slipped to his feet . " Nice day , it sure is , ai nt it ? " he chattered aimably as he pulled the wire cable that started them on their leisurely course to the second floor . " Purty day . Suits me right down to the ground  --  and then back up to the fifth floor . " He laughed in a musical trill at his pridefully repeated joke . Their bedroom was enormous and dim . A huge double bed covered with a red damask spread stood under a looped up mosquito net which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling hung a chandelier with many of its crystal droplets broken and with only a few bulbs screwed into its outlets . A ceiling fan hung stagnant below the chandelier and under the light and the fan on the floor , was a round table and beside the table were two big easy chairs . The door was open into a bathroom the size of an ordinary room . The green outside shutters were closed against the sun . It looked restful and impregnable . " Want them open ? " the elevator boy asked , moving toward the windows . " No ! " said Ral violently . " Thanks . . . . You go hurry up that ice and stuff I asked for at the desk . I 'm a man who needs a drink . " The boy departed , closing the door , and THE KISS , THE TREE they were alone . Ral took his hat off and sailed it across the room onto the bed . He stripped off his jacket and threw that , too , missing the foot of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean sweat under his arms . Angela sat down in one of the big chairs and pushed her round hat farther back on her head . Ral came over and took her limp hands . " Well , here we are , honey , " he said . His voice was triumphant . " You , and I. Married . " He patted her hands together . " I love you , " he said , quickly and gently , diffident and almost embarrassed . She disengaged her hands and caught his face . They kissed tenderly and lingeringly and for a moment everything was all right . There was a discreet knock at the door . Angela got up and moved toward the bathroom . " Wash my face , " she said over her shoulder , " while you mix . Make it stiff . " " One of my best , " said Ral . " I sure do need it . " T HERE was a giant cockroach in the bathtub . Angela eyed it with distaste , but without alarm . You could not do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no mice , although there undoubtedly were . She remembered when they had held the annual Cotillion in the Andalusia House ballroom , after the old Oaks had burned down and before the new one was built . A rat had got loose among the dancers and in the pandemonium that followed , every woman had clutched at least one male . It was very funny . But still she hated mice . She washed and repowdered and rerouged her face , and put on fresh lipstick . The bathroom mirror was speckled , green , and distorted . It was a comforting mirror . You knew you did not look like that . Res cheerful voice called , " Come drink with me and be my lover The cocktails were strong and good . " The best bourbon , " said Ral , with satisfaction . " Drink it up . There 's more where it came from . " Angela took a long swallow . " You certainly mix a pretty old fashioned , Ral , " she said . This was a nice room , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think they'llfind us ? " Her fingers tightened convulsively on her glass as she asked . " No , I do not , " said Ral judiciously . " I honestly do n't . Sonny Boy will split a gut ! " He threw back his head and laughed victoriously . " Honey , " said Angela slowly . " You do n't mind because this isn't -- the first time . Truly , I mean ? " " No , Mrs. R. , I do not mind at ail , " said Ral , firmly and warmly . Then he scowled , " Unless of course there was any other guy in on it . " He had always exaggerated his jealousy , for which there was no foundation , just as she had tried to suppress and minimize hers because it had been all too well founded . The colored boy who had opened the garage for them brought their suitcases and Rat 's portable radio into the room . He eyed the fifty cent tip Ral gave him with disfavor . " Oh , well , " said Ral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember when they 'd have kissed your feet for a half buck tip , " he said when the boy bowed out . He opened one of the suitcases and took out a full bottle of bourbon and put it on the table . He put the radio on the dressing table which stood against the wall and fastened the ground wire onto the cold hotel radiator and then turned the radio 's switch . He nodded contentedly as the volume swelled . Angela watched him idly , feeling calm now and a little happy . She was draining the last of her cocktail . Ral came back to the table and started to make another . The announcer on the radio said loudly , . . . continuing our program of old favorites . " There was a trumpet note and a drum beat and then a clarinet went straight into the refrain , " Who stole my heart away . . . " Ral tapped his foot and sang the words with the music . " Who made me dream all day . . . remember , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . Seems as though I 'll never be blue . . " Angela put up her hand , palm out . The tears were gathering within her like swift rain clouds in a midsummer sky . Their song . It was playing on the victrola in Carrie 's living room . She had wandered out on Carrie 's wide front porch with handsome young Ralston Raleigh from Oglethorpe . The porch was a nest of shadow between the brightly lighted room and the brightly moonlit yard . They began to dance to the music that filled the shadows from the open lighted window . " Who stole my heart away .... " It was understood that they would kiss , and kiss they did , easily and practically , with due regard for balance , grace , and the anatomy of the nose . In the middle of the kiss , the kiss had changed , and their two lives with it . He had said , afterward , in disturbed amazement , " But you are n't even very pretty ! " It was a startling statement from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and butter of his speech . It was the measure of his deep sincerity . Then he had said , ardent , humble , and a little frightened , " You are made of moonlight . You are so gentle and strange and  --  different . Angela , Angela , Angela . You are something special , and you are mine . " Angela got up quickly and went over to the mantelpiece that topped the iron grate . She turned her back to RaI . She fought her tears passionately for Ral hated her crying jags and she was on the verge of a real one . There was reason enough , verily , verily , reason enough ! There was.a mirror over the mantelpiece and she saw her face , swollen to bursting with tears , her hateful , ruined , ugly face . And behind her , more clearly somehow in the mirror , she saw Ral 's face , fat , red , ruined and ugly , too . " Who . . . who . . . no one but you . " How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and it was too late . The tears broke like a midsummer storm . " It 's too late . . . too late . . . too late . . . , " she wept , " Ral , it 's too late . " " Oh God , " said Ral , " Do n't cry . Maybe it 's not too late . " " It 's too late ! " Her voice rose . He came over and clapped his hand over her mouth . " Stop it , " he said sharply . " Right now . " " Too late , " she got out between his fingers in a thin scream . H E HELD her a little away from him with one arm and slapped her . It was business-like and not unfriendly . She gulped , drew in a long breath and throttled her rising hysteria with a wrenching effort . " That 's it , " he encouraged her . He led her to the chair and handed her a drink . " Not too fast , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying quietly now , in floods of soft summer tears , rain , but no storm . She would be all right with a little more to drink . There was a better stage of drinking that lay just beyond this one . The quiet , rosy stage , a little misty , but cheerful and almost completely controlled , that came a little further on . Maybe she and Ral could reach it together and stay in it for a while . That would be nice . They would be very happy if they could be just that drunk for a long time . Drunker , they were apt to be quarrelsome and sometimes violent . She remembered the time she had put her heel through Ral 's windshield during a struggle , and the time Ral had quite simply blacked her eye . So did the town remember . RaI turned off the radio and came over to sit beside her . " It 's not too late , " he said insistently . " Listen , honey . Get it through your noodle that we are married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The amazing , final , accomplished fact of their marriage was difficult to encompass . She looked at her ring in wonder and her tears slowed . " We 'll get straight out of here , Angela , and go to New York . The name of Raleigh may not mean much up there , but they ca n't throw my reputation at me there , either . I 'm not so dumb , Angela . And forty is n't old up there , or even fifty . I know it did n't work when I went before , honey , but you were n't with me and you 're my girl . I need my girl . This time , we 're going together . By God , why not ? " There was vigor in his voice . His voice was young . " Darling , listen . I 've loved you over twenty years . That 's a lot more than most of them can say for themselves . " That was true . It was a rare and wonderful thing . Their stubborn fidelity to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had survived the chill of the Raleigh house when Angela went there and the heat of her mother 's recriminations when she brought Ral home . They had loved each other still through the ghastly periods of Ral 's occasional , desperate infidelities and through their own protracted quarrels , begun when they were drunk . After the automobile accident when they had failed to get married , theirs had become almost a married love , relaxing against its own strains because the bonds were too strong to break . Through the long years until not even in Oglethorpe could Mama be considered white trash any more . Until Mama had finally decided that Ral was better than nothing , and then , belligerently , that Ral was fine . Until they had finally won , and they were married . They had what they wanted . " Oh , Ral . . . " said Angela . " To hell with the past . Here 's to the future , honey . " They drank . Angela smiled and the welt in her cheek , reddened by tears , creased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went by in little , pleasant rushes . They were married . They had escaped . They loved each other . They were alone together . On these cornerstones , they erected a tower of hope . Their plans , their hopes , accrued detail and validity through the minutes . Ral was pacing now , earnest and voluble . His face looked leaner as the muscles of his padded jaw hardened with determination . Angela floated lightly above the floor of her old cynicism and hopelessness . She looked at him with softened eyes , and he was still the man of her dreams . She was surprised when he stiffened mid-step and hushed mid-sentence . He had frozen like a pointer with the scent of game in his accomplished nostrils . She listened , straining and puzzled . There was a rustling outside their door . " Mice , " thought Angela , distressed . " I do so hate mice . " Something had happened to Ral 's face . His eyes were hooded like a snake 's with sullen fury . His lips were open with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face down into his collar and up into his hair . On tiptoe , he crossed over to the baggage rack where his suitcase lay open . Why was he quiet because of the mice ? He thrust his hand under the neatly folded clothes and brought out his leather revolver case . Angela watched him in mute incomprehension . He often shot rats at Oakland . He was a wonderful shot with a revolver . But you did not shoot rats in hotels . He slid the revolver out of its holster as he moved , dropping the holster on the table beside her . Ral ran across the room , still on tiptoe . The revolver was in his hand . He turned the handle of the door with a wrench and opened it inward . Sonny Boy , on his knees in front of the keyhole , saved himself from falling into the room by falling backward into the waiting group outside the door . A poised spoon fell on a held dishpan and the noise was deafening . " Got you , " cried Bucky . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy staggered to his feet . " Goodby l'il bride , po ' blonde bride , " he called to Angela . " We 'll bring him back to you some time . " He put his hand out toward Ral . There were eight men in the posse . Most of them , like Bucky , had been Ral 's ushers . On the fringe of the male pursuit , Carrie stood watching them anxiously and Marilyn Lee stood buxom and strong beside her , glaring at the men with her big , pop eyes . " Rai , put that thing down , for God 's sake , " said Carrie . " Get out of here , " said Ral in a deadly , steady voice . " Get out of here . Clear out and stay out . " " Man , man , you sure were smart , " said Bucky who looked a little uneasy now and foolish , holding the dishpan and spoon apart so that they would not clatter again . " You sure owe us a round o ' drinks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing . He was the drunkest of them all . " Hooray . . hooray .. . my Father 's gon na be hung . . , " he sang . " Get out , " said Ral . " Or I 'll shoot . " He fanned the gun at the group . " Oh , yeah ? " said Sonny Boy . " Listen , I 've been waiting fifteen years for this . You dished it out  --  now you can take it ! " He lurched forward into the room . There was an explosion and then silence . A NGELA felt as she had when their car hit the tree . Ten years ago . Rai was driving recklessly , full of liquor and hope , driving them to Marianna to be married , speeding away from frustration . It had happened when they came to the bridge that crossed the river above Marianna where the filling that made the road level with the bridge at the other end had been washed away in a storm . When they hit the tree , beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then blackness , nothing . This time the noise ' had not struck her into unconsciousness . The silence ended . She watched Sonny Boy stagger back , his hand to his shoulder . She heard , as if from across the river and through a mist , the babble of voices , the sound of footsteps running down the hall . She watched Ral close the door and push the broad bolt . Then she heard Carrie 's voice , gruff , clear , and affectionate . " You hear me ? " Carrie called through the door , over the confusion of noises outside , " Yes , " said Ral , coldly and distinctly . " Stay where you are . Do n't budge . Hear me ? Do n't let anybody in . Not until I say so . Do n't talk to anybody until I tell you . Hear me ? " " Yes , Carrie , " said Ral . " Angela okay ? " called Marilyn Lee . The noise surrounding the three women swelled and then receded down the corridor outside . Ral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck and looked at Angela . " I reckon so , " he said . " Okay . See you later , " said Carrie . " There are things to do , " said Marilyn Lee briskly . Their voices stopped and there was silence again . Ral came over and sat down quietly in the other chair beside the table . He put the revolver slowly on the table and put his elbows on the table and leaned his head on his hands . Then he slowly tilted his head so that his profile lay in one palm and bent his other hand down to cover hers . His smile was wry and enigmatic . They said nothing . For the moment , there was nothing to say . There was nothing to do but wait . Well , thought Angela , aimlessly , we ought to be good at that . But why did the hours ahead of them stretch longer in her mind than the twenty years gone by ? Twenty years was a long time . She must think of it as a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indicated by calendar leaves that fluttered down into space . The image was imperfect . Time was more like an overturned pot of glue . It poured down stickily and slowly , like the river beside the town . The years , months , weeks , days , hours , minutes were all sticky and inseparable . Tomorrow became yesterday and it was never today . It was never , never Now . Once in a while it was Now . The first time Ral had kissed her ... the instant they hit the tree . . . the moment the revolver fired its bullet . Those were Nows . Beginnings and ends encompassed so quickly that they belonged , separately , to themselves , distinct , THE KISS , THE TREE complete . But what happened between the kiss , the tree , and the bullet ? The same things , over and over , and that was why it all stuck together and time was foreshortened . That was why you could not tell its length . The river of glue had incorporated the kiss which had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the tree and left it standing , but distantly , alone and meaningless . They drank and began to talk a little in undertones . They talked , not to say anything , not even to communicate , knowing what was in each other 's minds , but for the sound it made in the big , quiet room . After a long , long time , the telephone rang . " Listen , chicken , " Carrie 's clear voice said into Angela 's ear . " Here it is . God , have I been running around like I had two good legs ! First . Sonny Boy is all right . Ral got him pretty , scared him sober , and his arm will be in a sling for a while , but he missed the bones . Two . Ral is under arrest , but we 're putting up bail and I 've personally guaranteed to Chief Black that Ral wo n't skip town . Marilyn Lee has fixed it with her Papa to keep it out of the paper and the guy that reports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee 's and works for the old man , so that 's safe . Sonny Boy is threatening to shoot it out with Ral with his left hand and is squawking his fool head off , but Marilyn Lee and some of the boys are getting drunk with him again . I 've squared the Andalusia House . Let 's see . That 's all . . jack says you-all come out and stay with us a while . Your mama is having hysterics all over your house , but Jack gave her a sedative he says will send her to sleep for a week . We 'll bring some good whisky out to the house and Marilyn Lee says she 'll make us a shrimp paella for supper as soon as Sonny Boy passes out . I 'll clear them all out early ... You all right ? " " Carrie ... Carrie ... " " Hang on to yourself ! " said Carrie sharply . " Now give me Ral . " Angela sat quiet and tearless while Ral listened to Carrie . " Good work , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then , " Thanks , Carrie . . . Goodby , now . " He turned to Angela . " It 'll blow over , " he said . " Oh , yes , " said Angela . It would be buried in whispers in the capacious community closet behind the door that was never opened for strangers . There the bones of it would rattle with the other town skeletons . It was not even a very impressive skeleton , thought Angela ironically . It was certainly not too big for the town 's capacious closet . If Ral had killed Sonny Boy , now , with all that crowd around , it would have been one hell of a job to stuff it away . But the town took good care of its best . " Let 's get out of this dump , " said Ral . " Let 's go on out to Carrie 's and get good and drunk . " Angela nodded . She got up and picked up the gun gingerly and buttoned it into the holster . She corked the whisky bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put them in . She closed and buckled the suitcase . She picked up her too-young hat and walked over to the mantelpiece and tugged it onto the back of her head . It seemed to her that her fingers were sticky with glue . The bullet had made a little hole in the past , already far in the past , a little spinning eddy far up the river . The tree was a still more distant snag around which the glue was lazily flowing . And the kiss ? It was part of the stream . She turned to find Ral standing behind her . He looked old and blotched and rather pathetic . He put his hands on her shoulders and she lifted her face . Gently they kissed . Then they left their bridal chamber and descended into the town .
