New York 's mayoralty campaign was over before the election . The sure winner in the battle of personalities ( rather than of municipal issues ) : 55-year-old , Erin-born Democratic and American Labor Party Candidate William O'Dwyer , onetime New York City cop , onetime Brigadier General in the U.S. Army who , like Tom Dewey , gained fame as a gang-busting district attorney . <P> The candidates got into the public eye as much as possible as the campaign spat to a close last week . But through it all , flashing the personality that has endeared him to New Yorkers even when they were weary of his clowning , fussy , dumpy , outgoing Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia never once lost the center spotlight he loves . <P> On his Sunday radio program , the Mayor ( who leaves office on Dec. 31 ) lectured New York housewives on the best way to cook a big turkey in a small oven : " The stern of the turkey , you know , the rear end-they call it the rudder here-is cut off about one inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Brooklyn clinic that he dislikes horse doctors because " a horse doctor pulled my first baby tooth . " Wednesday he fired a few practice shots at Candidate O'Dwyer to sharpen his eye for his shooting bee with Governor Dewey on Manhattan 's station WOR . <P> And Bubble Gum . Friday was his big day . In the morning the Mayor paid a surprise visit to a Manhattan traffic court , lectured and grimaced through 197 cases . At 10:30 Friday night , following Governor Dewey 's dignified , half-hour endorsement of **25;15642;TOOLONG Candidate Jonah J. Goldstein , Fiorello LaGuardia had one of his most sparkling innings . " You know , " he cackled , " we prepared the studio today to hear the Governor . We put tapes on the windows , we braced ourselves , we wore lead-glass goggles , ready for the atomic bomb . And all we heard was the snap of a wad of bubble gum . " <P> With this for a starter , The Hat tore into the Governor and all local tickets ( except his own , headed by No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " politician " as though it were a vile epithet . He raked New York 's ancient political machines from The Bronx to Brooklyn , despaired of his carefully nurtured " good government " if Morris failed at the polls . He even attempted to sell his man to Tom Dewey : " Governor Dewey . I ask you ... do the big thing . . . admit the hopelessness of Goldstein 's campaign . <P> Next day , in his office , the Mayor presented scholarships and instruments to 29 musical children , warned their parents : " Do n't make them play pieces for company before they are ready . " Saturday , after a final boot at Tammany and its candidate , O'Dwyer , he called it a week . <P> As usual , Fiorello LaGuardia had enraged thousands of New Yorkers , tickled thousands , and fascinated thousands . But he had bored very few . Perhaps that was his secret , even more than his withering frankness and his relentless fight for honest government . Whatever it was , the people knew one thing for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best Mayor it had ever had .
