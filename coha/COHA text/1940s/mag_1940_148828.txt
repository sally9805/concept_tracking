Loud was the muttering last week from U. S. citizens who feared the fifth column within their gates . Many a citizen pointed with alarm at U. S. Communists , U. S. Nazis , urged any and all means to combat them before it was too late . Just as loud , and more vocal , were the outraged counter-cries from the Communist Party , meeting in New York City for its national convention . In a report which took him four hours to read , General Secretary Earl Browder praised Soviet Russia as the " only one really neutral Great Power " remaining in the world , the protector of weak nations , the " beacon light " of the working class . Said Browder : <P> " Who are the ' fifth column ' in the United States ? . . . Martin Dies . . . . The Roosevelt Administration . . . . The Republican Party leadership . " <P> Just as aggressive was the Party platform which promised to : oppose all war loans and credits to the warring imperialist powers ; stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; resist the militarization and armaments program of the Administration and Congress . <P> At week 's end , in a raucous session attended by 22,000 in Madison Square Garden , waving red flags , U. S. flags , the Party nominated : for President of the U. S. , Earl Browder , convicted of passport fraud and facing a four-year sentence , now out on bail pending appeal ; for Vice President , Negro James William Ford . <P> Though the average U. S. citizen might feel concern at these public trumpetings of a political group openly devoted to a foreign State , official Washington was more concerned with another side of Communism-its real , underground activities . In Washington : <P> &gt; The Senate approved a Presidential reorganization plan , already passed by the House , switching the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Department of Justice . <P> &gt; Attorney General Robert Jackson created a " national defense investigation unit " within the Federal Bureau of Investigation , put stern , jut-jawed Veteran Agent Hugh H. Clegg in charge . Jackson also recommended legislation to require the registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would no longer certify for employment proven members of " the Communist Party , the German Bund , or any other Communist or Nazi organization . " <P> &gt; Representative Martin Dies , on a trail he has been snuffing up a long time , proposed legislation to outlaw both the Communist Party and the Bund , fix heavy penalties for membership , suggested the President create a council of home defense to coordinate the FBI , the Secret Service , Army and Navy Intelligence . <P> &gt; Before the Senate was a drastic , catch-all bill , introduced by Texas ' Tom Connally , which would deport aliens for ( among other things ) writing seditious articles , possessing dangerous weapons , engaging in prostitution . <P> &gt; Already passed by the Senate was the twisted La Follette Bill ( see p. 19 ) . <P> &gt; Planted in the Senate was Bob Reynolds , chief of the Vindicators , who avowed : " I 'll be sittin ' there every minute watchin ' things , and ready to amend bills to deal with aliens whenever possible .
