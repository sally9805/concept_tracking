It was the first broadside of the 1948 presidential campaign . Before 1,300 cheering Ohio Republicans in Columbus , U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft+ opened his " campaign last week by raking the Truman Administration from prow to poop , blasting its domestic policy and its foreign policy and praising the Republican Congress for crimping the powers of the executive . He exposed himself to the hot fire of counterattack , but that would hardly dismay Ohio 's Taft . <P> The record of the 80th Congress is one of Bob Taft 's credentials for his candidacy , and he made the most of it . The first Republican Congress since 1931 was organized , he said , " without friction and without Bilbo . " With few exceptions , " differences within the party were reconciled in the party interest . " Despite criticism from " Communists , New Dealers , the C.I.O. . . . and those modern planners who do not really approve of Congress at all , " the 80th passed more important laws than any previous Congress . <P> Old Battles . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of labor itself is in favor of nearly every reform contained in the act . " <P> On income-tax reduction , twice blocked by presidential vetoes : " In my opinion the tax burden today is more than can be long maintained without threatening the existence of a free economy . We are taking 30% of the people 's income . . . . " <P> On economy : the 80th Congress " achieved the best economy record ever attained by a peacetime Congress in a quarter of a century and made the biggest cut in presidential recommendations for expenses since the present budget system was established in 1923 . " Taft 's estimate of the cut : $3 billion . ( Other estimates , all complicated by interpretive arithmetic , ranged up to $5 billion and down to $1 billion . ) <P> New Trail . During the 80th 's sessions , Bob Taft had walked more or less silently and uncomfortably in the footsteps of Michigan 's Arthur Vandenberg on matters of foreign policy . He followed that trail no longer . " I am not happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . " <P> U.S. policy was " befuddled . " He said : " Through the agreements made at Teheran and Yalta by President Roosevelt , and at Potsdam by President Truman , we practically abandoned all the ideals for which the war was fought . . . . " Blazing his own trail through the thickets of diplomatic history , he reached these conclusions : " We created an impossible situation in which freedom is suppressed throughout large sections of Europe and Asia . In Germany our policy has been dominated by the harsh and impractical Morgenthau plan , even though the Government pretended to repudiate it . Our German policy has wrecked the economy of Europe and now we are called upon for cash from our taxpayers to remedy the breakdown . " <P> The U.S. , he said , has " made dollars available to foreign countries in almost unlimited amounts , with little restriction of the use to be made of them . " This , he said , had caused domestic prices to rise . " Those loans should be confined to actual goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . to restore their own productive ability . "
