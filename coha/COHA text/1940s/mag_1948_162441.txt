All Harry Truman wanted was a back porch-a cool place where he could sit of an evening , as he used to back in Independence , listening to the whir of the sprinkler on the lawn and the sound of neighbors ' voices coming clear through the summer air . He consulted an architect ; together , they found just the place for it . It would be inconspicuously tucked away behind the pillars of the White House 's south portico , at the second-floor level . The plans were drawn , the money ( $15,000 ) set aside from White House maintenance funds . Then the storm broke . <P> The Commission of Fine Arts loudly disapproved the scheme , declaring that it would " permanently change the appearance of the south faade.

Other Presidents have made other alterations with &; without outcry . Jefferson added wing terraces and long rows of one-story " offices , " which also served as " meat house , wine cellar , coal and wood sheds and privies . " Buchanan tacked on a glass conservatory , Coolidge raised the roof ( unnoticeably from the outside ) to find room for eight bedrooms .
