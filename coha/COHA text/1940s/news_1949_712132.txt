txt Declaring that he did not know how often in the future he would be able to speak to them , Archbishop Josef Beran today begged Roman Catholics to believe in him even if they heard ' he had " made a confession . " He said he would never make an agreement with the state that infringed on the rights of the church . His appearance at Strahov Monagery to deliver a sermon ended rumors that he was under house arrest but left no doubt as to the critical stage he had reached in his struggle with the Czechoslovak Government . Three thousand persons , including hysterically sobbing women , heard the Archbishop declare from the pulpit of the monastery 's church : " Perhaps very soon you will hear all sorts of things about me from.the radio . You may hear that I have made a confession or other things . But no matter how often you hear these things I hope you will believe in me . " In a loud , clear voice but tense with emotion he added that " one day if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church and the state you should ' mow that I would never conclude an agreement that would infringe upon the rights of the church and the Bishops . " When a messenger brought word that Archbishop Beran had left his palace , an organ began to play in the Strahov church and women began to weep . Women strewed white peonies in the prelate 's path as he arrived at the church in a black Tatra car , five minutes later at 7 P. M. A little girl pressed into his hand a bouquet of white carnations . He took the bouquet and blessed her . With the tall gold and scarlet ' jeweled mitre of an Archbishop on his head , the white and gold stole over his shoulders and the silver and gold crosier in his hand he faced the crowd from the marble pulpit . " I know what you expect of me , " he began softly . " You can imagine what I would say and how I would say it . But I wo n't say it because I do n't want this fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how often I will be able to speak to you . What , ever happens , do n't believe that I have surrendered . " He spoke in the baroque church of 1,800-year-old Strahov Monastery , whose Dominican Abbot Jarolimek was among the first to declare that his name had been included on the list of those endorsing the Government-sponsored " Catholic Action " without his consent or approval . The Archbishop had accepted the invitation to speak , church officials explained , because the monastery will tomorrow observe the birthday of its founder , St. Norbert , along with Corpus Christi Day . Although the church nor/mally holds ' , 2,000 , a throng of 3 , - ' 000 crowded in today . As the Archbishop moved to the altar for prayers he leaned heavily on his staff tapping it audibly on the flagstones while two church servants tried to support him . Prayers for Misled Souls First he prayed for the youth of Czechoslovakia , that they should not be misled and should be educated in the Catholic spirit . He prayed for Catholic families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are cells of society " and then for those Catholics who are wavering in faith , that they might be strengthened and not be " misled by lies and distorted reports . " In reference to priests who have been listed in the press as supporting the Government-sponsored " Catholic Action , " he asked help for those whose names had been listed but who did not even know their names were being used and who had suffered in consequence .. His last prayer was for " Judases who are betraying their priestly calling , who allowing themselves to be tempted by short-term successes and material benefits . " Apparently refreshed after his prayers , the Archbishop walked steadily down the aisle raising his hand high for all to see as he blessed the people . Church servants could scarcely clear a path for him as the people reached to touch his robes . Some women kissed his hands . Outside the church people enclosed his car chanting " Long Live the Archbishop , " " We wo n't give up , " and " We believe you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sides . Some women were still in tears . One of them slipped under the wheels as the car turned and the driver had to reverse to release her . She was slightly injured . Judging by their dress , the people who started this impassioned demonstration were preponderantly middle class . Three-fifths were women . There were some who looked as though the. , might . be classed as workers . Although a chill wind had risen and a sprinkling rain fell from the gray sky , the crowd streamed down the hill to the square on the side of which stands the Archbishop 's palace and on the other side Hradcany Castle , residence of President Klement Gottwald . Excitedly they chanted and sang the St. Wenceslaus hymn , the national anthem and other songs until Archbishop Beran came out on the balcony . He calmed them , saying : " I have faith in you . I trust you . Have faith in me. * * * Now I suggest that you go home peacefully . " Tomorrow morning , Archbishop Beran is scheduled to lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , the police and other Government officials are continuing to search the files of the consistory in the Archbishop 's palace .
