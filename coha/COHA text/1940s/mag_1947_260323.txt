The presentation of Oscars - Hollywood 's annual pat on the back to itself-has to be seen to be believed . TIME Correspondent Dwight Whitney , who saw it last week , fought his way through acres of diamonds , mink and glossy black limousines to report : <P> Everything about this year 's Academy Awards show was the biggest . There were more jewels , more big names , more hoopla-and more bleachers for more middle-aged women who arrived early in the day with lunchboxes for a glimpse of the stars . There were 35 Oscars , 16 searchlights ( crisscrossing in contrasting shades of white , blue , red and orange ) , a 66-piece orchestra , 250 policemen , 90 ushers , 50 stagehands , six parking lots and 125 parking-lot attendants . There were three hours of coast-to-coast broadcast and 6,000 popped flashbulbs . <P> The whole shebang cost the studios $65,000 . Metro 's top art men , Cedric Gibbons and Jack Smith , personally did the $10,000 " set " stage : a pylon , backed by six Greek columns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the evening slunk by , this gaudy setting was filled with some rare gems : <P> Sam Goldwyn managed , as usual , to get foot in mouth once : taking pains to commend Hoagy Carmichael , he referred to the singer-composer as " Hugo . " <P> Film Czar Eric Johnston , who always provides a fragrant oratorical nosegay , was in top form . Movies , he declared , are immortal art-the first new art , in fact , since Greek drama . <P> Cinemactor Ronald Reagan gave from the heart in introducing a reel of excerpts from Oscar-winning films of yesteryear : " This film embodies the glories of our past , the memories of our present and the inspiration for our future . " When the film came on , it was running backwards . <P> Olivia de Havilland , in accepting the Best Actress Award ( for her work in To Each His Own ) , came onstage as gauzy and misty-eyed as a Walt Disney angel . She began with a ten-second acceptance speech of simple thanks , fought for control , lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , when her sister , Joan Fontaine , rushed backstage to congratulate her , Olivia froze and moved away . ( The girls were standoffish even before Joan beat out Olivia for the 1941 Oscar . ) <P> Of the 35 Oscars , Sam Goldwyn 's The Best Years of Our Lives won nine-almost all the important ones . The picture itself was Oscared as the best of the year . Sam was Oscared for the year 's best contribution to the industry . William Wyler was Oscared for directing Best Years . Fredric March was named the year 's best actor for his role in it . Handless Veteran Harold Russell was chosen the best supporting actor , and got another Oscar just on general principles . ( Best supporting actress : Anne Baxter in The Razor 's Edge . ) <P> When the evening ended , Hollywood had not exactly proved , even to itself , that it was really good in 1946 . But it had proved that the Academy vote is nowadays reasonably free from political pressure . There was a time when it was possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Samuel Goldwyn ) and deal him right out the back door .
