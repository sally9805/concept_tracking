Britain may build a new African empire because of a discovery announced last week : a new synthetic drug called Antrycide , to cure and prevent trypanosomiasis ( related to sleeping sickness ) in cattle . The drug will be used in a vast area of Africa , larger than the U.S. , where profitable ranching has long been impossible because of tsetse flies which carry the wiggly protozoan parasite of trypanosomiasis to domestic cattle , horses and hogs . <P> Fighting trypanosomiasis by attacking the flies with insecticides has never been wholly effective . Some flies always survived and quickly re-established the fly population . As a result , the whole great African area ( including Kenya , Uganda and Sudan ) has only about 16 million head of scrubby , inferior cattle . Even these hardy beasts often die of the disease . David Rees-Williams , British Undersecretary for Colonies , says of Antrycide : " It will enable Africa to carry much more cattle than Argentina , where there are now about 33 million head . " <P> Antrycide was developed by two young chemists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39-year-old Francis Henry Swinden Curd ( who was killed in a railway accident last November ) . In 1944 they were working on Paludrine , a drug for malaria . One of the compounds they tested proved slightly effective against trypanosomiasis . Three more years of work produced a related drug that did the job , with complete success on mice . <P> Early last year a team of chemists , biologists and veterinarians set out for Africa to attack the trypanosomes in their native stronghold . A single dose cured cattle infected with T. congolense and T. vivax , two worst forms of the disease . It also worked well against other forms in cattle , horses , dogs , hogs and camels . Healthy animals appear immunized against infection for as much as six months . <P> Some authorities on trypanosomiasis believe that Antrycide has not been tested enough , but last week all food-conscious Britain was cheering the empire-building drug . The Colonial Office predicted that African cattle raising will show positive improvement in four years and large-scale development in ten years .
