The desired end was to get the British Empire 's air lines into efficient competition with the fast moving U.S. lines . But at the Commonwealth Air Transport Council in London last week , the delegates squabbled over the means . <P> Britain 's tall , dictatorial Lord Swinton , Civil Aviation Minister , suggested , in line with Britain 's white paper ( TIME , March 26 ) , that traffic within the Empire be split equally between Britain 's Chosen Instrument , the British Overseas Airways Corp. , and Commonwealth air lines . <P> Canada was profoundly uninterested in this arrangement . Its Government-owned Trans-Canada Air Lines plans to start flying the North Atlantic ( Montreal to Prestwick , Scotland ) on Sept. 1 . By getting a fast start on this rich route , it expects to corral enough traffic so that it can meet all comers , will not have to split with any . In the face of Canada 's determination , Lord Swinton reluctantly agreed to competition between B.O.A.C. and Canada on the North Atlantic . But he won his point on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to India , South Africa and New Zealand . ( T.C.A. may balk at pooling the Canada-Australia route . ) On these the conference agreed to pool traffic , split it equally-e.g. , if six flights are flown to India , B.O.A.C. will fly three , Indian airlines the other three . <P> In practice , this theory may not work so well . There was plenty of evidence as the Conference ended that , when the other Commonwealth nations are ready to fly , they too may balk at pooling traffic on well-paying routes , may be willing to try it on poor routes . If so , U.S. airlines may get far more competition than they have expected .
