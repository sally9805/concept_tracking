txt City Budget Action Criticized Townsend Harris High School Cut Is Called Inexcusable To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The elimination of Townsend Harris High School is inexcusable and can not be supported by any valid or logical reasons . Here is a high school which in three years turns out a student who would require four years ' schooling at any other New York City high school to accomplish the same result . Here is a high school which develops the best of our boys rapidly , efficiently and in a manner comparable to the best schools in the United States . With a stroke of his pen the Mayor disperses these unusual students ; erases the splendid system which took many years to create and blots out the cream of the high schools . I hope a concerted movement will be made by the parents of our boys to get the Mayor to change his mind or get the Board of Estimate to restore moneys to the budget to continue Townsend Harris High School .
