txt The ruling hierarchy of Soviet Russia is celebrating the thirty-second anniversary of the Bolshevist revolution by unleashing a new attack against the United States . This was launched by Deputy Premier Malenkov , the tough young machine politician who is now reaching out for the succession of Marshal Stalin by liquidating his opposition , and whose first major policy speech on international affairs deserves special attention for that reason . Mr. Malenkov accused the United States of plotting new wars and forcibly militarizing Europe for that purpose in order to create an American world empire surpassing that planned by Hitler , Goering and the Japanese imperialists . He warned at the same time that Soviet Russia now had the atomic bomb and that as a result , in case of war , it was in a position not only to bring suffering to the American continent but also to wipe out the whole capitalist world . Mr. Malenkov spoke , of course , from that weird world of the Kremlin , which is enclosed by mirrors in which every Bolshevist sees his own image and imagines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objectives at which he and his colleagues aim , and denounces as " warmongers " all those who would oppose their design . What that . design is is freely proclaimed by their followers , such as the Czech Communist editor who compares the Communist Empire with the Roman Empire and boasts that it will last for thousands of years . If there is one comfort to be derived from Mr. Malenkov 's speech it is that , in seeming modification of Mr. Stalin 's proclaimed stand that war is inevitable , the Deputy Premier again stressed that Soviet Russia desires peace and even , in effect , challenges the rest of the world to " peacetime competition . " If that assurance can be taken at face value it can be welcomed . But the peace he offers is the peace of the " cold war , " and the competition he proposes is the competition of political infiltration , underground warfare and rival armament . This is evident from the whole tenor of his speech , from his boasts about the Soviet conquest of its surrounding puppet states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , finding no counterpart in the supply of Soviet consumer goods , can pertain only to an expansion of war industries . It is evident , above all , in his renewed offer of a " peace pact " between Soviet Russia , Britain , France , China and the United States , which , like the " nonaggression pacts " of Hitler , is designed to free Russia 's hands for stronger action in all other areas , and in his renewed demand for the prohibition of atomic weapons without effective inspection ) He would thus disarm the United States while leaving Russia free to produce bombs behind its Iron Curtain . A " peace pact " which outlaws not only aggressive war but also the use of force anywhere in the world has already been concluded between most nations of the world in the United Nations Charter , which Russia is violating at every point . And the latest Soviet rejection of effective atomic inspection is also an answer to the well-meant but somewhat naive proposal for an " atomic truce " advanced by Assembly President Romulo.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
