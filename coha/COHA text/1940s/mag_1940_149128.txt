Picking all-star teams is a thankless task . Invariably-whether it is an All-America football , All-Star baseball , Davis Cup or Olympic team-its pickers are heckled by grumblers who think they could do a better job . Last year , when the Professional Golfers Association selected ten pros to represent the U. S. in Novem ber 's biennial Ryder Cup matches with Great Britain , the pickers were greeted not only with the customary chipped beefing but with a sizzling roast by fiery little Gene Sarazen - omitted from the team for the first time since the Cup was put up in 1927 . <P> Such a team - Byron Nelson , Henry Picard , Sam Snead , Ralph Guldahl , Horton Smith , Paul Runyan , Dick Metz , Jim my Hines , Harold McSpaden , Vic Ghezzi ! " From the boys they overlooked I could pick ten that would beat the pants off that team , " sneered Sarazen - with a special glare at his old rival , Walter Hagen , chosen captain for the seventh time . <P> The P. G. A. pickers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ryder Cup matches , Sarazen 's squawk went the way of most sport squawks . Last month , however , when P. G. A. bigwigs were looking for ways &; means to raise money for the Red Cross , they remembered it , decided to call Sarazen 's bluff . <P> No windbag , the little Roman promptly named his challengers : Old-timers Tom my Armour , Harry Cooper , Billie Burke , Craig Wood , Jimmy Thomson , Al Watrous , Lawson Little and Newcomers Jim my Demaret , Ben Hogan , Ed Oliver . <P> Last week , before 7,000 eyewitnesses , the prestige of U. S. sport pickers was put to a test . On Detroit 's dog-tiring , tricky Oakland Hills course , Gene Sarazen 's " leftouts " teed up against Walter Hagen 's " ins " in a two-day challenge match under Ryder Cup rules ( four two-ball foursomes , eight singles matches ) . * <P> At play 's end the first day , it looked sad indeed for Captain Sarazen . Only Demaret &; Hogan , the two Texans who have burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with victory in the Scotch foursomes-i up over Sam Snead &; Ralph Guldahl . Trailing 1-to-3 , the " leftouts " took on their singles assignments with grim determination . Even Captain Sarazen went into the fray . But the best they could do was split the day 's matches with the rightful Ryder Cuppers , to lose the two-day battle 7-to-5 . <P> Undaunted , Sarazen bellowed : " I 'm not ready to admit defeat . " <P> * Two members of the ten-man teams are spares .
