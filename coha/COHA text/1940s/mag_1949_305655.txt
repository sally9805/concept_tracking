( See Cover ) <P> The Hatfields and McCoys of baseball were at it again ; for the fifth time in nine years , the St. Louis Cardinals and the Brooklyn Dodgers were in a slambang fight for the National League pennant . The hopes of the other six clubs were as dead as Abner Doubleday 's grandfather . <P> As the National League lead seesawed through August , fans who lived far from Brooklyn or St. Louis began to take sides . The Midwest , from Chicago to the Ozarks and down into Texas , was Cardinal country ; the Dodger cheering section was centered east of the Alleghenies . The two teams had almost monopolized the National League pennant since 1940-the Cards won it four times and the Dodgers twice-and it was clear to all but the die-hards of mathematical chance that one of them was going to do it again . As far west as San Francisco last week , Dow-Jones tickers carried the inning-by-inning score to boardrooms , and fans clustered around radio sets as St. Louis , nursing a two-game lead , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> With a Bicycle . At Ebbets Field , a restless buzz rose from the crowd as the first two Cardinals took their turns at bat . Then a slender young man , wearing No. 6 on his back , stepped to the plate . Stan ( " The Man " ) Musial was at bat and the crowd really let go . A hard-bitten minority booed , but they were drowned out by the cheers . It was Brooklyn 's sportsmanlike tribute to one of the greatest players in the game . Stan Musial is the highest salaried ( at $50,000 a year ) and most feared batter in the National League-and especially devastating in Brooklyn , where he has batted well over .500 this season . When Musial grounded out that first time UD , Ebbets Field breathed more easily . But on his next trip to the plate , Brooklyn groaned . " The Man " had lined up on an inside pitch and hit it squarely . <P> The ball cleared the right-field screen , sailed across Bedford Avenue and came to earth in a parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won , 5-3 , and there was no joy in Brooklyn . There was still less in the first inning of the second game that day when Musial belted another homer to give St. Louis a two-run lead . Things looked black in Brooklyn , but it turned out to be the darkness before dawn . The desperate Dodgers got down in the dirt , clawing and scratching , and won the second game , 4-3 . <P> In the rubber game , Brooklyn 's big Negro righthander , Don Newcombe , silenced Cardinal bats ( 6-0 ) with the help of outfielders who chased fly balls like men on bicycles and made " impossible " catches . One smash from Musial 's bat would have been a triple if Outfielder Luis Olmo had not bounded high into the air against the left-center-field wall and made the catch-of-the-month . <P> <P> Brooklyn had managed to beat the Cards two straight ; it was more than anybody else seemed able to do . While the Dodgers were breaking even against the Chicago Cubs and winning one from the Pittsburgh Pirates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took three out of four from the Giants ( with the help of three Musial homers ) ; then they went to Boston , took two more from the Braves , with Musial clouting a homer and a triple .
