Margery Sterling , who took a master 's degree in home economics at Cornell , is a young housewife who knows how to turn out a lemon pie . One day husband Robert , a chemist in Westinghouse Electric Corp . ' s Pittsburgh laboratories , got to wondering if anything on earth was fluffier or lighter than Margery 's meringue topping . That helped him along with a scientific idea . <P> In the lab , aided by twice-a-day phone talks with his wife , Sterling broke eggs , separated the whites and whipped them up . Then he measured the physical properties of his meringues . After using dozens of eggs , he switched to other materials , finally hit on a phenolic resin as the best . This week , Westinghouse claimed that Sterling 's " meringue , " made by heating the resin with a catalyst to 350 F. , was the world 's lightest solid . At any rate , it was ten to 20 times lighter than the fluffiest pie topping . <P> Westinghouse could see it used as an insulator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold well ) and between metal sheets in prefabricated building units . Non-inflammable , it has a specific gravity between .008 and .012 ; among currently popular insulators , rock wool ranges from .15 to .25 , fiber glass from .02 to .15 . ( Margery Sterling 's meringue grades from .12 to .15 . ) Enough plastic foam to insulate a six-room house can be shipped in a single barrel , saving storage and trucking space , to the site where it will be used . A workman can soon learn to cook it on the spot . <P> Other new scientific notes : A surveying gadget built into two small boxes mounted on a trailer ( to be pulled by a car or jeep ) , has been developed by the Sun Oil Co . Starting from a known elevation , an odometer records distance traveled . A pendulum indicates up &; down grades , and an electronic calculator works out , by trigonometry , net changes in altitude . Valuable in oil prospecting , the apparatus enables height surveyors to work three times as fast as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazards as sunstroke and frostbite . An electronic I.F.F . ( identification , friend or foe ) device which can be coupled directly with gun-aiming equipment was announced by the National Security Resources Board . In World War II , when an I.F.F . reported that a target was friendly , the message had to be relayed through two or three human elements . The result : at best , delay-at worst , disaster . The improved apparatus now locks a gun so that it can not be fired when aimed at a plane , ship or tank which I.F.F . indicates is friendly . To get such automatic protection , the target craft must have its own part of the I.F.F . equipment ( the " transponder " ) switched on and working properly . CJ A new microphone , weighing less than oz. and smaller than a stack of six dimes , had its radio try out . Developed by California 's Altec Lansing Corp. , it does not hide a speaker 's face , does not boom when he gets too close , is omnidirectional and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can be hidden in a boutonniere might make it useful to sleuths-friend or foe .
