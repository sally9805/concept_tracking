CITY IN PRISON By JOSEPH ALSOP The best character sketch of the author of City in Prison that can be written is a statement of a simple facto As soon as Joe Alsop got back to this country from Japanese captivity he began bedeviling everybody in Washington for another go at the war in Asia . He is back in China now on a Government mission . There are a few footnotes to the story . Alsop. in his early thirties , has seen more of life and the world than his fellow Groton and Harvard graduates usually see in generations . He made journalism his firm highroad as soon as he graduated from Harvard , rather scornfully rejecting the more conventional careers that habitually absorb members of the Alsop and Roosevelt clans , to both of which he belongs . He was a star reporter in his early twenties , a crack Washington correspondent in his late twenties . He and his writing partner , Bob Kintner ( now Major Robert E. Kintner , of the United States Army ) , contributed regularly to The Saturday Evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the finest ever to come from the crowded Washington scene . Long before Pearl Harbor , while their syndicated newspaper column was at the peak of its national popularity , Alsop and Kintner threw it overboard to go into the services . ? The Editors . I T WAS a warm winter morning , lit by a pale sunlight that grimly illuminated the wounds of the city , when the Japanese ordered all British , Dutch and American nationals in Hong Kong to report at the Murray Parade Ground with such personal effects as they could carry . Along with nearly 3500 others  --  men , women and children , old and young , sick and healthy ? I began that day the experience of internment . It endured for me until the Americans were exchanged six months later , and still endures for the 3000-odd British and Dutch who remain behind the barbed wire in Stanley Camp . It was a singular experience , different from military internment  --  we were all civilians or pretended civilians  --  and perhaps more interesting , for we were the bits and pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been blown sky high and come down together again at haphazard . And for this very reason it was a most curious commentary on people and their relations to one another and to their surroundings , and seems worth writing about ILLUSTRATED BY ROBERT RIGGS 12 even now in America , where the war is so incredibly distant despite the gaps in families and the uniforms in the streets , where respectable people who began scrabbling in garbage cans would be hastily bundled off to the psychiatrists . The society I speak of was the former ruling caste of the British crown colony of Hong Kong . I was , of course , an interloper , only there at all because the Pan American shuttle clipper had brought me to Hong Kong the night before Pearl Harbor , on my way back from a mission to Manila for Gen. C. L. Chennault and the American Volunteer Group . Being an island , the place was a trap and I could not return to my post on General Chennault 's staff . They wanted no last-minute volunteers . So , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up wounded until the surrender came on Christmas Day . That afternoon , before the first files of Japanese troops  --  little , animal-looking men  --  marched into the deathly still center of the city , I burned my passport and papers and obtained from the American consulate officials roosting gloomily in their big office a new " certificate of identification " as a newspaperman . So , barring the accidents of investigation , since I was not in uniform , I was ready for what was to come . Between the surrender on Christmas Day and the Japanese order that settled our fate , there was more than a week of suspense  --  of crowding together , day after day , in the odd places where the abrupt end of fighting had left us ; of anxious discussion of Japanese intentions , and of occasional sallies into the streets to buy food and supplies from the Chinese hawkers , who soon swarmed everywhere with the miscellaneous loot of the city in little boxes and baskets . The Hong Kong garrison was interned at once , but civilians and ostensible civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unforeseeable future . My efforts , which turned out better than the average , were the purchase of a small canned-food reserve and the manufacture of emergency bedding out of a borrowed blackout curtain and two chair cushions from the American Club . I spent most of this limbo time at the club , where several scores of people were sleeping on the floor each night and carrying on a strange caricature of the normal club life by day . But on the night before internment I removed to the Gloucester again , to stay with the local A.P . correspondent , Vaughn Meisling , who had , with great generosity and courage , offered to support my self-identification as a newspaperman . We had an odd night of it . Besides me , Meisling was also giving shelter to Bill O'Neill , the Reuters ' correspondent , and a tough , violent little man who was half crazed because his wife was one of the three volunteer nurses raped and bayoneted by the Japanese on the day of the surrender . At eight P.M. a Chinese friend tipped us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being printed by the South China Morning Post press . As the hotel food was uneatable and we had more canned stuff than we could carry , we all gorged ourselves on corned mutton and dill pickles and Vaughn 's last bottle of whisky , much in the manner of savages consuming their stores to keep them from the enemy . After the meal , I slipped down the corridor to ask an acquaintance 's beautiful Portuguese girl friend to sew some sapphires I had bought in Burma into the collar of my coat . She took a long time , for A unique and distinguished fact story of how an entire community behaves when herded behind barbed wire . she was a careful , convent-trained seamstress , and she had to work by candlelight . Three lumps of bright blue sapphire matrix were too big to be hidden . I gave them to her , and she gave me a piece of soap , and we said good-by and wished each other luck . Then I went back to Vaughn 's room and packed , and we all tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the broad street which runs past the Murray Parade Ground , was filled with English and Americans of all sorts , alone and in groups , all lugging suitcases and bundler . Huge crowds of Chinese , unaccustomed to seeing the city 's privileged caste carrying anything heavier than the morning newspaper , looked on from the sidewalks in pleased astonishment . The parade ground , a big , square , spz.ce at the heart of the city , next to the barracks , was filled with more people , all milling about aimlessly , or sitting limply on little heaps of battered-looking luggage . Shortly before noon a detachment of Japanese gendarmes and interpreters drove up , and after a good many misunderstandings everyone was lined up in a column'of fours . After a short inspection , the 200 people at the head of the column were marched off by a couple of gendarmes . The column moved forward , and the inspection and marching off were repeated several times , until my section of the column was reached . We fell to the ( Continued on Foge 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts to show that General Motors was too big and too diversified . Its officials had often been challenged to say what good reason there was for them to make anything other than automobiles . If they never got a wholly satisfactory answer during the years of contention , they are getting an answer now . Today , both Pratt Si Whitney and Wright Aeronautical have licensed other companies to make their engines . Pratt &; Whitney engines are being made in the automotive field by Ford , Buick , Chevrolet , Continental Motors and Nash-Kelvinator . Wright Aeronautical engines are being made , for example , by Studebaker , Chrysler and Continental Motors . In every instance this has meant the sacrifice of cherished secrets . It is quite impossible even to suggest how great this expansion has been , except that it transcends everything else . When peak production is reached in the year ahead , it can be measured at not less than 2500 per cent . For anyone to say today that General Motors is too big would be like saying the Navy is too big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japs . But what sort of a picture can you form out of the bald statement that General Motors by the end of October had delivered more than $1,400,000 , - 000 worth of war goods to the Government in 1942 ? This meant General Motors ' own Allison engines for Curtiss P.40 Kittyhawks , for Bell Aire-cobras , North American P-5I Mustangs and Lockheed P-38 Lightnings ; it likewise meant Pratt &; Whitney engines for many other types of aircraft . It meant , as well , gun motor carriages , parachute flares , naval-gun housings , armored cars , airplane landing gears , radio receivers , machine guns , aviation spark plugs , carbines , oil coolers and radiators , marine electrical equipment , fuses for shells and bombs , blackout lamps , ambulances , tank cannon , shells and shot , batteries , automatic pilots , aircraft cannon , airplane instruments , fire-control equipment , antiaircraft guns , airplane wings and parts , tanks , electric motors , airplane fuel pumps , cartridge cases , airplane propellers , tank-gun mounts , antiaircraft-gun mounts , Diesel engines for tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , machine tools , airplanes and Army trucks . Consider just one item in that list ; Diesel engines for ships . That Diesel-engine development , which began with a conversation between Alfred P. Sloan , Jr. , and Charles F. Kettering , now reaches right to Tokyo harbor . Our submarines are able to go twice as great a distance as they were able to go before . Many of these are propelled by Diesel engines , a two-cycle type of efficient engine similar to the one that can take a train across the continent ata fuel cost scarcely greater than it takes to run a truck the same distance . If we strike at Japan across the Pacific with submarines more effectively than they strike at us with their submarines , one of the reasons is that we have got General Motors . General Motors grew great , implementing our lives for peace . Now there are 104 General Motors plants and operating units in forty-six cities and thirteen states . All are on war production . Had you gone to one at Lapsing , Michigan , last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the yard . It was there , visible and idle . Gigantic blocks and cubes of alloy steel strangely sculptured in pairs in the shape of doors and fenders , and matching like sets of false teeth . Those were the dies which had shaped automobiles . The last automobile made there was in January , 1942 . It gives anyone who was ever there when brand-new care were rolling off the line a queer feeling of mixed com-fort and terror . Inside the gate , your ears will be assailed by battle noises that echo overhead out of ventilating pipes from underground . Deep in the earth they are testing guns  --  automatic cannon . This is about as much as may be said about the production there , ex-cept one other thing : Management , using engineering and selling as a team , generated that tremendous force for making serv- picleaanbtle things in the automobile Science ca n't do much for a nation without selling . Science in the person of Doctor Cohn , of Harvard , developed what is known as blood-serum albumen . From the standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the most important development in medicine since the sulpha drugs . Although not quite so complete , it is an improvement over blood plasma for treating battlefield victims of traumatic shock . It is an improvement because it is so much more simple to administer . In today 's battles the percentage of severe wounds is five or six times greater than in any previous war . Bomb splinters and automatic cannon do more damage than rifle and machine-gun bullets . The thing that makes the ready-touse Cohn injection so valuable is that , although not a complete blood transfusion , it is the equivalent as far as traumatic shock is concerned . But how was this to be produced on a mass-production basis ? Even Doctor Cohn could not provide the answer , but the big pharmaceutical companies , staffed with scientists and production men , took the assignment in their stride . They got big through selling . Penicillin , a new drug , for the simple reason that it represents an unachieved goal , is a clearly defined case of the need for the profit motive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulpha drugs will reach , but which can be checked by penicillin . It is a chemical which can be produced from a certain mold . The first penicillin was produced in the United States at a cost of $6000 a gram . Three grams ? $18,000 ? would save a life . But not many could be saved at that price . Under the direction of the National Research Council , several of the biggest pharmaceutical houses have been working steadily to find a cheaper way to produce this lifesaving substance . They have got the cost down from $6000 a gram to sixty dollars . They hope to get it down to fifteen dollars a gram quickly enough to save lives in this war . The goal , of course , is to produce synthetic penicillin , so that it can be sold in the corner drug stores of the land . When that day comes , penicillin will save a life for no more than sixty cents or so . Is it so wrong to have somebody making money out of a lifesaving thing at sixty cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $6000 and he rid of the profit motive ? ? One thing is certain : If , after winning this war , we wind up with any system that cuts out profits , then we shall really be shooting the works . It would take a long aheLF of book , to tell the complete story of American war production . In this series of three articles , of which this is the third , Mr. Sparkee makes no attempt even to summarise the full story ; rather , he has chosen some of the dramatic high lights  --  as examples of what a democracy can do when the pinch comes . Many in dustrics not dealt with in these articles are , of course , doing an equally good tab. ? The Editors CITY IN PRISON ( Continued horn Page I 3 ) lot of a squat captain of gendarmerie with a face like a dog and an unshakable belief that any command in Jsapanese , if only shouted loudly , would be understood by all . He had a way of kicking people in the stomach if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily , he generally gestured when he bellowed . We moved off docilely behind him , between the walls of Chinese spectators , down Queens Road into the poorer district of the city . After trudging a mile and a half , we turned abruptly into a narrow alley and were halted before the grilled door of an ancient , dilapidated and very dirty building . Painted on the peeling plaster was an announcement in Chinese that it was the Stag Hotel , offering comfortable rooms at cheap rates . In reality , it was a Chinese brothel of the third class . In response to the gendarme captain 's hammerings and bellowings , the grille was opened by the brothel proprietor , an evil-looking , pale green Chinese with bad teeth , and we all marched in . What we found was a brusque eye-opener to those who had been cherishing delusions about their lot as captives of the Japanese  --  as had most of the smug relics of Chamberlain 's England , corroded with complacency and corrupted by easy profits , who were numerous in Hong Kong . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reported to the nearest policeman . The Stag must , I think , have been built as a private house by a rich early China trader . The original rooms were very large , and there were still traces of good workmanship here and there . But now the rooms had been partitioned off into innumerable little cells , and the partitions , which were of chicken wire after the first eight feet , had been put in without regard to light or ventilation . For furniture the cells had only large , very hard Chinese beds , a broken-down chair or so and a grimy washstand . Each cell which had once housed a single Chinese prostitute was now marked in chalk on the door as accommodation for a minimum of three and commonly four or five people . But there was no time to complain . We all scrambled for rooms , while the gendarme captain and his staff tramped up and down the corridors , hustling the elderly and bewildered , and constantly making the queer barking sounds habitual in irritated Japanese . The brothel proprietor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfiture.They resented us , since our arrival had deprived them of their customary means of livelihood . On paper the ensuing seventeen days look pretty macabre , There were about 140 of us in the Stag  --  seven other brothels held the balance of the civilian internees in Hong Kong . There was no heat , no light , no bedding except what the internees had brought or the prostitutes left behind . There were only three toilets in the entire establishment , and all three worked only intermittently . It was bitterly cold a good part of the time , with the damp , penetrating chilliness which Hong Kong in winter shares with Boston . The effect of the cold was vastly increased by the shortage of food . The Japanese occasionally delivered a little rice and the scrag end of an animal , but the deliveries were made to the brothel proprietor , and , except in the last few days , the cooking was in the hands of the brothel runners . They were naturally anxious to find in us the profits we had cost them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived on what we had brought in , what we could buy at staggering prices from the brothel runners , and an official issue of two cups of rice and two cups of gruel daily . Most people had little more than the official issue . Nor could one forget the facts of life in the Stag by plunging into happy pastimes . Except for a borrowed Bible and Vaughn 's pocket edition of Dante , I could find no reading matter , and although I had cards , one began to freeze at the extremities after a couple of rubbers of bridge . Finally , there was nowhere to exercise except on the roof , the dry-rotted beams of which cracked audibly all day long under the feet of groups of people seeking air and release from the confinement of their cella . The groups in some of the cells were downright fantastic . In one , a tired-looking Anglo-Portuguese father from Macao , a brisk Scots mother , and six children , the youngest under a year , all sheltered together . In another , the bed nightly contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish gunman soldier of fortune ; a peevish young blonde ; the blonde 's poisonous child , and the child 's plump nurse , whose battle cry , " Tommy , stop picking your nose ; it 's dirty , " continued to resound until dawn . We used to speculate on whether the nurse talked in her sleep or stayed awake all night . Because we had a very small cell , Vaughn and I had only one roommate , but even he had his drawbacks . ( Continued an Page 48 ) ( Continued from Page 46 ) I had bedding of my own and minded rats far less than too much company , so I slept on the floor . Vaughn and our roommate used the bed . As Vaughn is six-foot-four , neat-minded , and far from fond of people at close quarters , it would never have been easy for him to share his couch . Fortunately , our roommate claimed Irish Free State citizenship and was exempted from internment after the first fortnight . But the really odd thing about life in our brothel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , and their startling failure to be as disagreeable as they sound . Certainly , existence in the Stag was not agreeable , either , and because of the diet and the extreme confinement it was unhealthy . As long as most of the common necessities of life had become unattainable luxuries for everyone , it was difficult to feel their loss too acutely over a long period . One slipped back , as it were , into the mood of the time when the things we think of as necessities did not exist . One rose , washed , dressed and breakfasted on scraps , if there were any . After the first cigarette , ten times more pleasurable because consumption was cut in four to meet the shortage of smoking supplies , one cleaned the room , washed clothes and did necessary mending . These duties and a walk on the roof used most of the morning . The rest of the day was spent reading , playing cards , walking again on the roof , standing in line for the two issues of rice and gruel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , as there were no lights and the cheapest candles were expensive , one talked until bedtime . British Heroines Vaughn and I generally spent our evenings with the lender of my Bible , Miss Ayrton . Miss Ayrton and her special crony , Miss Stops , were genial , shrewd and independent-minded British spinsters . They had acquired small competences in business in Shanghai , had retired to simple ease in Peking , and a year later , when the war broke out , had left their new home to volunteer for national service . They had behaved with unexampled courage during the fighting in Hong Kong , running a food depot under continuous shellfire as though they were conducting the fancywork stall in a rural charity bazaar " at home , " as they still called England . They had lost everything , but they said nothing of that . Instead , they briskly discussed the splendid opportunities for useful work in the postwar reconstruction of Eastern Europe , where they had both by chance spent some of their early youth . Miss Stops , who was fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward-looking conversation with cheerful anecdotes of the Russian revolution . She had , I think , been a governess in a rich Russian family ; for nearly two years she had been in considerable danger and quite out of touch with the outside world in some such place as Tiflis , but she seemed , on the whole , to have enjoyed the turmoil hugely . To pass the time , we all used to play word and geography games every evening in the dark until we felt sleepy . The best of life in the brothel was the discovery of people like Miss Stops and Miss Ayrton . The worst was the endless speculation on the future . Most of the time , the Japanese left us to the far from tender mercies of the brothel proprietor and his staff , interested solely in their pound of flesh . For official supervisors we had only the Sikh guards on the gate  --  members of the Hong Kong police who had gone over to the enemy the day after the surrender  --  and a trembling , toothy Wang Ching-wei supporter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything but crouch in his office and drink tea with members of his large family . Speculation on the future was renewed every three or four days , when the dog-faced gendarme would turn up , bark loudly at everyone , and then , using the quaking Mok to interpret , inform us that we would soon be transferred to a permanent internment camp . Forecasting the exact intentions of the Japanese , even after they had been declared , was about as useful as reading the future in the flight of birds or the livers of oxen . On our seventeenth morning in the brothel , the expectation of transfer to a permanent internment camp was actually fulfilled , however . We were herded out into the alley , formed up in a column of fours again , and trudged off between the usual Chinese crowds , who now looked somewhat more sympathetic . Our destination was a pier on the water front , but when we reached it the entrance-was closed and we waited endlessly in the street . The audience there , particularly big , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese crowds , they were not very promptly responsive to policing . We understood the changed expressions on the Chinese faces when a cretinous-looking gendarme suddenly dragged into the open an inoffensive Chinese who had evidently failed to understand a shouted order . After giving the man two shattering blows across the shoulders with a heavy bamboo carrying pole , the gendarme tried to make him kneel for a formal beating . The Chinese , crazed by fear and pain , attempted to wriggle away . At that , the gendarme , who was plainly enjoying putting on a show for the waiting procession of British and Americans , gave way to a sort of frenzy , bringing the carrying pole crashing down on his victim 's head and shoulders until he fell to the ground . By this time a second gendarme , strangely armed with a steel golf club , had hurried up to help . Although the Chinese had fainted , they continued to beat him for five minutes , sometimes striking him across the face , and sometimes pounding him in the stomach and groin with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a convulsive shudder , which could mean only one thing . Then the two gendarmes walked back to their stations , smiling proudly , leaving the broken body where it lay . All this had happened in a terrible silence , broken only by the grunts of the gendarmes and the moans of the Chinese . After our suitcases and bundles had been searched for weapons , a big old harbor boat took us around Hong Kong Island to Stanley Peninsula . Stanley Peninsula , which was to be our home until our release , is a narrow , hilly , infertile neck of land running out to a bigger hill on which stands Stanley Fort . It had been the scene of the hardest fighting during the war , and it was at Stanley on the day of the surrender that the VAD 's had been raped and bayoneted , forty unarmed prisoners bayoneted , and all the wounded bayoneted in their beds in St. Stephen 's College and the Mary-knoll Mission Field Hospital . The Hong Kong jail lay at the end of the neck , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jail and the school building and masters ' houses of St. Stephen 's College . The entire camp area , a rough square one could walk around in half an hour , was surrounded by barbed wire , to which coolies were still adding the last strands when we arrived . Many of the buildings had been badly battered during the fighting . The first tasks of the camp clean-up squads were to bury the dead that still lay on the hills and to incinerate the blood-stained mattresses of the wounded from St. Stephen 's College . The corpses of the bayoneted nurses , wounded and prisoners had already been burned by the Japanese , but the big field-hospital rooms , dirty , disordered and blood-bespattered , told their story only too clearly . Yet the camp was not too bad at first glance . Tha buildings , of the styleless stucco-andtile sort which is modern official architecture in the Far East , were solidly constructed , and most of their plumbing had survived the bombardment . The space for exercise was considerable , which prevented the BlackHole-of-Calcutta feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty . Although our little neck of land was bleak enough , it lay between two fine bays across which one looked to high , bluish-green hills rising abruptly out of the water . Life at Stanley Billeting was the first great problem . It was done at haphazard , on the principle of first come , first served , except that large blocks had been set aside for special groups . The American bachelors ' quarters were in the former warders ' club . I was assigned to this building , where shellfire had scattered furniture , plaster , glass , bad prints illustrating Dickens , warders ' bar books and score books for billiards , darts and skittles in a fantastic confusion of souvenirs of war and peace . Meisling and I were again fortunate . Warned by experience , we seized the smallest room we could find  --  a bedchamber the size of a jail cell , about ten feet by seven  --  and because of its smallness were permitted to occupy it alone . But although it would have needed a shoehorn to get another man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley . The overcrowding was appalling . I remember one medium-sized room in the British married quarters which was shared by a businessman , his spoiled but ornamental wife and two young children ; a youthful Hong Kong civil servant , his wife and three babies  --  all suffering from impetigo contagiosus ? and three unmarried girls . Nor was this room in any way remarkable . The first three or four days were wholly given over to the effort to make the new quarters livable . There was hardly an object in the entire camp area which a normal community would not instantly have condemned to the junk pile . But old lumber , broken furniture , rusty nails , shell-torn curtains , blankets discarded by the prisoners in ' the jail , tin cans , clothes and food caches left behind by the troops on the hills , convicts ' uniforms , warders ' cast-off boots  --  all these were things of price , for which men , women and children scrounged all day while friends or relatives guarded their rooms and their luggage . It was an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paunchy taipan of a great merchant house returning from the day 's search with two thirds of a chair , an old pair of boots and a dead soldier 's mackintosh , with the pride of a man bringing home treasure-trove . The incinerated mattresses of the bayoneted wounded were the only things wasted in Stanley , and even of these one or two were snatched from the bonfire , cleaned a little , and put to use . No doubt it was not pleasant to sleep on the half-washed-out bloodstains , but for an unknowing child it was better than sleeping on the floor , which a great many people had to do . ( Continued on Page 51 ) ( Continued From Page 48 ) People had collected and improvised for themselves the same sort of conveniences of life that used to be found in the shack colonies of the great depression . After that , followed the improvisation of community life ? a revealing process , in which one could read the rules governing the aftermaths of social upheaval everywhere . Many of the men in Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the military camps . But there were enough at Stanley to make our community representative of the peacetime white society in the colony . Although it was in itself a ruling caste , white society in Hong Kong had furthermore been a microcosm of society anywhere . At the top were the superior government servants , the merchants and the bankers ; beneath them were their agents , the police , the clerks , the foremen in factories ; and beneath these again was a lesser class of really poor people , most of whom had been stranded in Hong Kong by accident and continued to live and work fhere for want of anything better to do . Now this small society had been subjected to an abrupt , violent upheaval , deprived of all it posseased , and finally re-collected at Stanley . The first impulse that ran through it would , on a larger social stage , have been called revolutionary . On every side , by almost every mouth , the former leading men of the colony were bitterly denounced . They were held to blame for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadways where people gathered to gossip , one heard the same angry talk of the taipans ' and the government servants ' complacency , stupidity and shortsightedness . Many of the taipans and leading civil servants had been left , while we were in our brothels , in their big houses on the Peak , a thousand feet above the city . By an odd chance , the internees from the Peak were quartered in the worst billets of all , the Indian warders ' apartments , which would have resembled a very bad tenement settlement even without the overcrowding . It gave immense delight to the rank and file that those who had been highest should now be lowest . A World in Little Yet revolutionary leadership was lacking . Thus there could be no real revolution , in which the lowest would become the highest , and a sort of compromise was arrived at , not dissimilar to the compromise made in Germany after the last war . For leaders the British and American communities selected two promoters and salesmen of the sort that used to swarm on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both were rich men . But both were lone operators , users of unorthodox methods , who were not loved by the stuffier , more conservative established businessmen , and both had a talent for melodrama . They struck just the right note of protest against the powers that were , and as we were not to have a real revolution , they were the next best thing . Accordingly , Neilson was elected chairman of the British , and Hunt of the American community in Stanley . Simultaneously , block committees were chosen , communal kitchens were organized , working parties were recruited , and a camp welfare committee was formed . The political process in Stanley was a semicomic , semi-gruesome take-off of the political process in the normal world . All the familiar features were there  --  the jockeying for place of special groups , the claims of the politicians to have done all that was good and to be blameless for all that was bad , the perquisites for those in office , the murmurs of those left in the cold , and the final , fumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camp politics quickly became an obsession with many internees . An astonishing number of people in the camp spent their time forming juntas , getting up , movements and drafting petitions . As the internees ' self-government covered only their daily routine , and could not change their basic living conditions , the movements generally concerned such matters as the personnel of the kitchen crews , the timing of meals , and the fairest system of ladling out the few extra spoonfuls of soggy rice when the first bowlfuls had been distributed . Yet these petty crusades were preached and engaged in with an enthusiasm that would have done credit to Peter the Hermit and his followers . Man , the political animal , being the mixture that he is , there was also much that was stirring to offset the pettiness and the backbiting . There was , for example , Mrs. Ziegler , the wise , handsome wife of a medical missionary . She had ten children , of whom seven were in the camp . Her husband was in the interior of China . Most people would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brood clean and healthy under Stanley conditions . Mrs. Ziegler not only cared for her own ; with perfect aplomb and triumphant success , she also directed the diet kitchen , which prepared and distributed the extra rations that we all contributed for the young and the sickly . Then , too , there was the vast hulk of a man , a retired naval chief steward , who ran the communal kitchen in the building I lived in . Some years before , after saying farewell to his galley on one of the destroyers of the American Asiatic Fleet , he had spent a night of celebration in Hong Kong , and had waked up with his life savings invested in a bankrupt local hotel . He had proceeded to make the hotel a huge success , and was close to being a rich man when the war came to the city . He brought to Stanley his chef 's cap , a large stock of condiments , and a squad of henchmen who might have stepped straight out of a Somerset Maugham novel . One was a Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a news item about a rich Calcutta Parsee offering a prize of $100,000 for a cure of his back pains . Another , Kanaka Dick , was an aged Hawaiian sea captain who had been tattooed from head to toe while on the beach at Hokkaido , had made a large fortune in the illicit opium trade , and wore the jade bracelet of a leader of the Hip Sing society . While other people were busy looking out for themselves , the retired naval chief steward and his squad spent the first days of internment cleaning out the kitchen in our building . Before long he was doing miracles with second-grade rice and scrag ends of buffalo . His language was sulphurous and his forma ! education had been brief , but he had courage , leadership , humor and an old-fashioned faith in people that put the faint hearts to shame . He kept us in good health and good heart . Although there were others among us who had occupied far more important positions in the outside world , Ed Gingles  --  for that was his remarkable name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community in Stanley created a sort of ersatz life for itself , choosing its own leaders , inventing its own political issues , furnishing its rooms with the refuse of a battlefield , substituting barter and the black market for the normal processes of commerce , and even sometimes holding its own parties . Barmecide Feast They were something , those Stanley parties . I used sometimes to be invited by a couple formerly celebrated for the sinister lavishness of their hospitality , from whose house it had once been difficult to escape sober and without indigestion . Four or five people , most of them dressed in rags and tatters , would gather solemnly in the couple 's room and seat themselves on the remnant of a chair and the couch made of hoards supported on concrete bombproofing blocks , which were the furniture . The host and hostess , still using the old lavish gestures and intonations , would produce a brew of tea leaves stewed for the third time and a little plate of cakes made of part of their luncheon rice sweetened with black-market sugar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire of carefully collected twigs . The guests would compliment the hostess on the fare as though it had been the cocktails and rich sandwiches of the old days , and the meal would be consumed with immense attention to an exact division , down to the very last drop and crumb of the tea and cakes . At every point in the life of the camp , there was the same singular substitution of values . A sweetened rice cake was a rich sandwich ; a tin of baked beans became the equivalent of lunch at the Colony , and a cell which would have aroused the fury of any housing authority in the United States had the status of a penthouse apartment . The prime perquisites of the successful camp politicians were these cells . They were narrow , concrete-floored , all but unlighted holes in the wall , which had formerly housed the jail warders ' Chinese women servants . But they conferred the invaluable privilege of privacy , and the politicians took them for themselves and for their women friends , and were bitterly envied for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the camp went on . Mothers tended their children and taught them . Housewives cleaned their apartments ? with little or no soap . Fathers of families did their best to be breadwinners  --  when there was no bread . The community exchanged the day 's small news every morning and evening in the roadways between blocks of buildings . Politicians busied themselves with issues and policies . Occasionally , the Japanese , who stood in the same relationship to us as providence to nations in the outer world , brusquely and surprisingly intervened .
