Musts for the " Silver Months " " We 've wasted the golden months in which we could have got fully ready , the months in which we could have expanded our steel industry , our chemical industry , our copper industry , and all the others . . . . But we still have ten silver months-the months which remain in 1942 . " <P> These sober words came from Don Nelson last week . A gun now , he said , is worth ten guns in 1943 . He also listed three silver-month musts , upon which " maximum production at once " depends . The production news of the week gave clues to how he meant to enforce them . <P> First on the Nelson list was " getting greater production out of the plants . . . which are now producing war goods . " That means crowding them with still more orders . Last week WPB 's Purchasing Chief Douglas MacKeachie told the Truman Committee that all war orders from now on would be awarded on a negotiated basis , rather than on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and red tape . But Douglas MacKeachie also announced that each contract would contain a standard renegotiation clause , which , if properly used , could not only 1 ) save money and time on contracts to efficient , low-cost producers , but 2 ) encourage the smaller , higher-cost firms who fear going broke on a fixed-price contract . <P> " Getting military production out of factories and machines which are now producing civilian goods " came second . Last week a tough-as-nails WPB told the radio industry-a " good " industry compared to most , in that it went after some war orders early in the game-to convert 100% in the next four months or else have their plants stripped of usable men and machines by the Government . Three other industries ( refrigerators , washing machines , office machinery &; typewriters ) got a less publicized but even more enlightening Washington lecture . They were told that WPB has a new conversion policy : 100% real war production for the skilled big fellows , concentration of minimum , essential , civilian production in the smaller plants . Competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via a " Victory " label for all such civilian production ) . Meanwhile , the little businessman in some industries , at least , has a new lease on life . <P> Don Nelson 's last point was the oldest , toughest nut-subcontracting-and he saved his toughest talk for it . " There is n't a single big producer who ca n't do more than he is doing now if he subcontracts , " he cried . " Industry has been lazy on this whole subject . . . . " Despite some Washington bright ideas , Don Nelson swore the subcontracting nut would have to be cracked by industry itself . The man who cracks it will be the MacArthur of the home front .
