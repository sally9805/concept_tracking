Homemade Cheesecake F You are in any doubt about the impor-I tance of the camera as an American institution you will be interested to know that the magazine Popular Photography recently reported that the Governor of Iowa , the Honorable Robert D. Blue , crowned a young lady named Jacqueline Andre " Miss Flashbulb of 1947 . " The Governor , the account said , " placed a crown of flashbulbs on Miss Andre 's head . " Whether intentionally or not he quite surely endeared himself to a good many of his constituents , for photography ( now that film is readily available again ) is reawakening as one of America 's most expensive and least harmful pastimes . During the war I lost touch with what the amateur photographers were up to , but I have recently spent some time bringing myself up to date on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few photo-supply shops , read a number of magazines about photography , looked at the Herald-Tribune prize winners in the Sunday edition and at the blowups in my neighborhood drugstore , and I can report that as far as the pictures go everything is normal . Nothing has happened . This year 's prints are the same silhouettes against faked sunsets , long-Legged girls poised ornamentally on springboards , squatting babies with ducklings , and close-ups of water-sprinkled daffodils that we were all used to ten years ago . In spite of the remarkable mechanical photographic developments during the war and the example of excellent reportorial photographs produced under stress , the camera in the hands of the amateur remains as old hat as a decalcomania outfit . In many ways photography should be the perfect art for a mechanical people like ourselves who are impatient with slower picture-making processes and who can achieve considerable technical facility merely by paying attention to what we are doing . Nearly anyone can learn to read a light meter , select a filter , set an aperture , and with some practice learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of technical facility is the common property of hundreds of thousands of amateur photographers . The trouble is that with all this skill at their finger tips they want to make Art . The amateur , especially if he is skillful , forgets that he has in his hand an instrument for recording or revealing a fact , and falls into the trap of trying to make a picture as he thinks an artist makes a picture . The result far more often than not is an empty piece of technically expert and unimaginative sentimentalizing . The difference between the point of departure of the professional photographer and that of the amateur explains what I mean . The professional works on assignment . Almost never does he set out to " create " art . If he is a fashion photographer he is concerned with merchandising and with chic , and some of the handsomest photographs that have been produced in the last twenty years are the work of men like Steichen and Horst and Lynes and Beaton who have brought imagination to selling dresses ? or by the photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker Evans ) who were recording a way of life during the early days of the Depression . These men were working on fact , and if there was art in the final print it was a by-product of expert functional picture-making . So it is with the news photographers , the industrial photographers , the scientific recorders , and an occasional honest portrait maker . The amateur , lacking direction , tries to create in a sort of purposeless vacuum . Clicking the shutter becomes important in itself , and print quality is talked about as though it were an end in itself . Last summer , for example , a Photo Carnival was held at the 71st Regiment Armory in New York . Professional models were hired to come and pose for amateur photographers who attended by the thousand . " They went away tired and happy , " U. S. Camera reported , " and with an estimated half-million pictures . " Setting out to make Art with the camera is not limited to amateurs , of course , , and there are many professionals like Man Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the long run only those photographs are worth looking at whose subjects are themselves interesting . It is the subject matter that makes the fascination of Brady 's pictures of the Civil War , of Nadar 's portraits of nineteenth-century literary figures , of Steichen 's prints for Vanity Fair in the thirties , and of the records of Paris that Atget made at the turn of the century . It is also why I believe that Steiglitz ' picture of a pair of hands , for instance , is meaningless ( this is heresy , of course ) , and why great technicians like Edward Weston seem to me to fall into the trap of endless and boring repetitions on the same themes . The same principles of subject matter can apply to the amateur if he is a serious photographer . Let him stick to taking those things that really interest him , of which he wishes to have a record ? his friends and his family , his house and barn , or apartment and fire escape , and let him show them only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures for art 's sake is a disappointing , fruitless , and finally disheartening business . The family album is a remarkably friendly and interesting document ; the photographs of mountain peaks reflected in upland lakes are a bore to everyone ? even eventually to the person who takes them . Ta-pocketa-pocketa TN HOLLYWOOD a year ago last May my wife and I spent the better part of a morning in one of the airdrome-like sound stages at the Sam Goldwyn studio , We watched the making of a brief scene for " The Secret Life of Walter Mitty , " which is embroidered , of course , on a five-page story by James Thurber . For two and a half hours we sat in those canvas-andwood directors ' chairs , our view obstructed by lights , baffles , technicians , " grips , " and the enormous technicolor camera while Fay Bainter , Ann Rutherford , Danny Kaye , and a horrid little gray lap dog went through half a minute of dialogue again and again and again . The most important part of the dialogue was the dog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obliging of the actors . He yapped , snarled , and bared his teeth when Danny Kaye put out his hand to pat him . He did it mechanically ( though convincingly ) every time he was supposed to and then lapsed back into dignified quiet until the next time his cue came . Kaye was more playful , teasing Irene Sharaff , the costume designer , at the top of his lungs between takes ( they had worked together in Kaye 's first Broadway success , " Lady in the Dark " ) , acting like a prima donna , relieving the monotony for himself by cutting up . No one was entertained , but no one seemed disturbed either . It was part of the hot , tiresome business of movie-making . Walter Mitty stayed in the cans for well over a year before he finally got to the theaters , and now , as anyone who has read Thurber 's and Goldwyn 's letters to Life knows , it is Thurber who is acting like the little gray dog , baring his teeth and snarling every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to see the film soon after it opened in a Broadway theater , principally to find out if the morning 's work I had witnessed had ended on the cutting-room floor . It had n't ; it was there all right , even shorter than I remembered . It looked spontaneous enough , and I was reminded of what Danny Kaye had said as we walked with him and Miss Sharaff to the commissary after the morning 's work was finished . My wife , obviously trying hard , asked him whether it was any fun . " Fun ! " he snorted . " You saw how it is . How could it be any fun ? Everything is rehearsals ; you never do a performance . " If you are an admirer of Thurber 's story ( which I am ) and a purist besides ( which I am not ) you will wring your hands in despair at the movie version of Walter Mitty 's dream life . The fantasy of the daydreams becomes confused with what is meant to be Mitty 's waking life so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Hollywood . If , however , you are n't worried about misplaced literary values , you will have fun ? even moments of delicious laughter ? and you wo n't be concerned about Thurber , who evidently had daydreams of his own about Hollywood . He is there only as a snubbed genius , while Kaye , as subtle a clown as you please , emerges as something close to a very great comedian . ? Mr. Harper collected essays in public journals , a mass of secret memoranda prepared in wartime for the British Treasury which , I am authoritatively assured , are of superlative brilliance , and possibly some revelatory private papers , the record is there for all to study . It is an ambiguous record . Keynes did not have one of those small minds that made a hobgoblin of consistency . On the contrary his mind moved from position to position with astonishing ease , trailing behind it the wreckage of positions abandoned and fortifying the new outlook with a brilliance positively dazzling , however dubious . Keynes always put on a fine show and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing the crowd . I hasten to add that I do not mean Coney Island pyrotechnics , but rather the verbal variety proper to a sophisticated London drawing room . Of the two new books on Keynes which are the excuse for these remarks the most comprehensive and useful is The New Economics : Keynes ' Influence on Theory and Public Policy , a collection of essays and other material edited by Seymour Harris ( Knopf , $4.50 ) . The other is a much shorter work by a single hand , reasonably worshipful , The Keynesian Revolution by Lawrence R. Klein ( Macmillan , $3.50 ) . The Harris volume is a kind of omnium-gatherum of useful Keynesiana , old and new , ranging from The Times ( London ) obit. of Lord Keynes ? a masterpiece in its field to sober essays , early and late , on the Keynesian revelation and fractions thereof . Some of the essays have the pleasant flavor of the famous chapter on the snakes in Ireland : " Keynes ' contribution to the technical literature on planning public works has been virtually nil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with essays which only economists would even pretend to read , a good many essays anybody can read with pleasure and , I hope , will . Two pieces stand out with especial vividness : Professor Schumpeter 's essay , a masterpiece of sympathetic criticism , and Keynes ' own great speech on the American loan to Britain , delivered in the House of Lords on December 18 , 1945 . The latter has a fascination for me beyond any other British speech delivered since the war . The editor , Professor Harris , contributed all too freely to the volume ; I found his essays uniformly boring and advise all readers to skip them . This is not the place to examine Keynes ' ideas in detail , but it may be useful to set down some of the conclusions that were reinforced by reading these two books . Keynes did not offer a complete and rounded system of economic thought . He examined special problems and emphasized points he felt were unduly neglected by other thinkers . It is for this reason , I think , that as Keynesianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade unions , it becomes vulgar nonsense . His emphasis on the problem of full employment was salutary , his emphasis on savings and investment was equally salutary , and so also was his deep concern with effective demand for the products of industry . But these emphases , and the insight he brought to their discussion , do not constitute a rounded interpretation of the economic universe . This is why Keynes ' own devotion to liberal capitalism should be kept constantly in mind . He was an individualist . When Mr. Klein , for example , argues in his book that Keynesianism is a last stand for capitalism and that if Keynesian ideas fail to gain general acceptance , the next possible steps are either right to fascism , or left to socialism , he is not arguing Keynesianism , but Kleinism . Keynes remained a capitalist . In fact his declining years were largely devoted to rehabilitating liberal capitalism , especially the open international market through the Bretton Woods devices which , he said , would " implement the wisdom of Adam Smith " ( not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stand-patters in believing that exceptional action was needed to achieve that rehabilitation . The point is , I think , that Professor Sweesy is profoundly right in viewing Keynes as a great bourgeois economist ? not perhaps the last , as Sweesy feels ? but in any case not a forerunner in his own person of some variety of non-Marxist socialism . What others may do with Keynes ' doctrine is quite another story . Two other points among a possible ' host may profitably be mentioned . Professor Schumpeter insists that " It can not be emphasized too strongly that Keynes ' advice was in the first instance always English advice , born of English problems even when addressed to other nations . . . he was surprisingly insular . " And he adds , " Practical Keynesianism is a seedling which can not be transplanted into foreign soil ; it dies there and becomes poisonous before it dies . " This leads logically to the observation that perhaps after all Keynes ' doctrines are a reflection of the general economic conditions in Britain in recent times . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris ' volume vehemently deny it , but the feeling will not down that in mood Keynes is somehow related to the general British fatigue and sense of exhaustion , so accentuated by World War II , but present long before . It is surely no accident , moreover , that the American depression allowed a rapid dissemination of Keynes ' doctrines . over here . Professor Schumpeter remarks that capitalism , with Keynes , " issues into a stationary state that constantly threatens breakdown . " A sustained reassertion of dynamic factors in American capitalism ? such a possibility is ruled out in Britain by the actions of the socialist regime and the basic peculiarities of the situation ? particularly a sustained American development in private capital investment , will utterly confound the Keynesians . Books like Terborgh 's The Bogy of Economic Maturity , essays like Arthur Burns ' " Economic Research and the Keynesian Thinkingof Our Times , " quite apart from their special emphasis , also raise the question of the absolute relevance of Keynesianism in America , not so much in the hands of the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of his epigoni , whose interpretations tend to be mechanical and dialectical rather than pragmatic . In short , how closely related to the special circumstances of Britain from 1930 to 1945 are Keynes ' doctrines ? Certain it is that Keynes ' policy suggestions were designed to meet British problems of that period . It was his singular agility in adapting himself to changing circumstances that saved him from doctrinaire absurdity . Such agility is not always observable in his disciples . Yet it can not be forgotten that the points that especially interested Keynes today interest us all . That is not to say , however , that on considering them we will all accept Keynes ' diagnoses or prescriptions . The point is that we all have lived in Keynes ' intellectual climate , and may , worse luck , do so again ; but if we are preoccupied with the same things , and evolve policies vaguely within the ambit of his thinking ? which thus far sums up the American public record ? this only makes us Keynesians in the sense that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all socialists now ? which is to say , not at all . Capitalism Among the Dinosaurs ? Dr. Alexander Baykov 's book The Development of the Soviet Economic System ( Macmillan , $6 ) deals with a fascinating subject in a fashion that creates the maximum amount of difficulty for the reader . Neither when writing English himself nor when submitting his Russian to a translator does Dr. Baykov achieve anything remotely resembling a lively style . But because he gives a play by play account of how the Soviet economic system got the way it was in 1939 , one hurdles the stylistic obstacles and even avoids being sucked down into the bog of obstinately academic footnotes ( referring mostly to Russian sources ) . This book outlines with enormous -- one might say appalling ? care the economy that , on the testimony of the Muscovites , is to carry humanity to ever rising levels of welfare when capitalism , in spite of the best efforts of the Keynesians , has joined the dinosaurs . I can not say I respond very warmly to the prospect . In the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked point that , on coming to power , the Bolsheviks had not the foggiest idea of how they were going to order the economic system to serve communist ends . They had no ready blueprints of their own , none had been inherited from Marx and Engels . They therefore had to fumble around , at first in a darkness confounded by counter-revolutionary and foreign intervention , seeking to discover some way merely to make the wheels turn . It was easy enough to expropriate the expropriators and sound the death-knell of capitalism , but it was appallingly difficult to make the properties of the expropriators disgorge what the expropriators had , with malign skill , wrung from them . The NEP was at once a confession of failure to turn the trick ? the Soviet economy came as near to a dead-stop as any in modem times ? and a desperate gamble . " Who will win ? " asked Lenin . " The capitalists . . or the proletarian sovereign power ? " In the event , the latter triumphed , largely for two very good reasons : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not abandon the commanding heights of the economy but hung grimly on to them ; and ( 2 ) that same power was used ruthlessly to favor the socialist sector An odd pair to " solve " the Palestinian tangle , I must say . . . As everybody knows , the Palestine question is involved in the oil question . Leonard M. Fanning 's American Oil Operations Abroad ( McGraw-Hill , $5 ) is a most useful straightforward account of the subject announced in the title , including a circumstantial narrative of how the Americans got into the Near East . Farmers ' Perennials A good book on the perennial farm problem is As You Sow , by Walter Goldschmidt ( Harcourt . $4 ) . Professor Goldschmidt is concerned with the industrialization of farming , especially as exemplified in California , and the urbanization of the countryside which inevitably results . His report makes exceedingly profitable reading , though it is rather overloaded with the hugger-muggery of sociological " methodology . " He accepts the trend he discusses ? what else could he do ? ? and advocates changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His indictment of New Deal policy is cogent and , as far as I know , rather original . This , indeed , is a book all Congressmen and Senators concerned with agricultural legislation should read and ponder . Properly used it could effect a muchto-be-desired revolution in fa'rrn policy . James Rorty 's Food at the Grass Roots ( Department of Agricultural Relations , TVA , free ) is also required reading for all concerned with the everlasting farm problem . In a way it cuts a bit deeper than Professor Goldschmidt 's volume . Rorty 's concern here is with soil fertility and its preservation ? with " the five per cent of exhaustible soil minerals ? calcium , phosphorus , potassium , " etc . His discussion of the problem on the farms and , in the fertilizer industry and in national policy is most cogent and illuminating . He rather fumbles in his account of phosphate on Nauru Island and in Australia and New Zealand , but that is a mere by-blow of an admirable job . " Lit'ry " Life Henry Canby 's American Memoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful effort to explain Henry Canby . To do so it tells of Dr. Canby 's life from childhood in Wilmington , Delaware , among the bourgeois Quakers , to elderly maturity in Cornwall , Connecticut , among the eternal New England hills , the " lit'ry " life in New York 1920-1946 being the real road of transition , though he survived temporary interment at Yale as a professor . May I be permitted to express passing wonder that Dr. Canby felt this auto-explanation to be a necessary enterprise ? Having committed that gaff , I hasten to add that my social sense leads me to understand that to an army of earnest readers the Doctor is indeed a V.I.P. His book about himself will undoubtedly find its thousands of readers unimpeded by my gentle deprecation . Actually there is a lot of " lit'ry " information in it : a lot about the , Saturday Review and the Book-of-the-Month Club , those very noble institutions , a good many well-done portraits of literary folk , more of sub-literary folk , something about the New York wits ( who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " ) , and a considerable bulk of miscellaneous anecdotage which is fairly entertaining . I could not hope to comment learnedly on all this , even had I the space , but there is one remark which insistently demands my professional attention : " Years later I was to see Australian writers still trying to repeat the English pattern for their own vast scene . . . . " Did he really have to see that when he was in Australia for OWI in 1945 ? I think not . The best Australian writing of the past fifty years has been done by men and women who have tried , often a bit desperately , to master the Australian scene as it is . I cite two classic names : Henry Lawson and Tom Collins ; and I could cite numerous living writers too . How Dr. Canby missed perceiving this development baffles me , for the evidence of it must certainly have been crowded on his attention at almost every turn . of Eastern tyrants , " which is roughly the equivalent of Mr. Gorbatov 's likening Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , Mr. Lincoln never uttered or wrote " one word to show that these shameless attacks ever aroused in him a single angry impulse . " The smart thing for the State Department to have done with that article in the Russian Literary Gazette would have been to print up a couple of million copies and distribute them wholesale in Korea , China , and wherever else American democracy could do with an effective plug . Mr. Corbatov handed us a first-rate piece of propaganda , and the humorless State Department threw it right back in Mr. Molotov 's face . Passing the Bucks T HE editors ' note at the beginning of this issue calls attention to the fact that our first three articles , although they were independently planned , all turned out , by force of circumstance , to deal with various aspects of a single problem : the world-wide shortage of American dollars . It begins to look as if the dollar were indeed almighty ? though in a rather terrifying way . The first of these articles , " Our Foreign Trade Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an economist with the importing - and trading firm of Stein , Hall &; Company and author of " The Uncomfortable Paradise of Full Employment , " which we published last April , and of technical articles in the American Economic Review and other journals . Mr. Heilbroner comes at the dollar shortage from the point of view of America 's own future economic health . He makes it clear that foreign loans and aid to Europe are not mere questions of charity , and that the Marshall Plan is not ? as some in their corporate or senatorial wisdom seem to suppose ? a sort of glorified international Community Chest to which we should " give " till it does n't quite hurt . On the contrary , the Marshall Plan , as it is called , is a method of helping to avert a catastrophe in international trade which ? if it comes ? will involve the United States along with all the rest of the world . mile second article , " Britain in the I Shadow " ( p. 392 ) comes up against the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic power and as a serious maladjustment incident to " the cataclysmic shift in world power " from Great Britain to the United States . The author of the article , Barbara Ward , is foreign editor of The Economist , by all odds the most useful and brilliant journal of economic and political comment published in England . Miss Ward is a thirty-three-year-old native of York , educated in schools and colleges in England , France , and Germany , who took a first-class honors degree at Somerville College , Oxford . She has been an editor of The Economist since 1990 , a governor of the Old Vic and Sadlers Wells theaters since 1945 , and a governor of the British Broadcasting Corporation since 1946 . Her books include The International Share-Out ( 1938 ) and Turkey ( 1941 ) . Miss Ward 's article is , of course , by no means an article about the dollar shortage or the Marshall Plan . it touches upon them only incidentally in the course of analyzing the various crises which have simultaneously pounded Great Britain . In its total scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fall of British Influence ? and Now What ? " Written as it was after Miss Ward had spent a considerable time in the States , it seeks to answer the very questions about Great Britain which are uppermost in the minds of American citizens . T HIRD and last in the group of articles is " Canada in Uncle Sam 's World " ( p. 401 ) by Leslie Roberts . Here , from still another point of view , the serious problems involved in our trade-relations with the rest of the world are emphasized . Since Mr. Roberts ' article was written , the Canadian weekly Saturday , Night , which deals soberly with political and economic matters , has declared that the dollar crisis does not at all mean that Canada will have to form any sort of union with the United States . " On the contrary , " it says , " it means cutting ourselves off from that country to a lar greater extent . " Mr. Roberts has written for Harper 's before .
