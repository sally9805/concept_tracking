Walt Kuhn is a big , rawboned old man . He looks like an upcountry sheriff on a spree , but he is one of the handful of top-ranking painters in the U.S. Last week , Kuhn ( rhymes with hewn ) was having a one-man show in a Manhattan gallery , and he took the opportunity to speak his mind on the state of modern art . <P> " It 's got ta stop ! " he began . " These young fellows do n't know where the Sam Hill they 're at . It 's true the Museum of Modern Art has contributed to the hilarity of the nation-but at a million dollars a joke . The good painters are never intellectuals , they 're simple people , with one-track minds . Now I myself was past 40 before I painted a decent picture . I was the gauchest thing you ever saw . But I 've had fun . God , I 've had more fun ! I 've probably painted three of four masterpieces in my lifetime , while they have n't done one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waving his huge hand in the general direction of Europe . <P> A Good Cook . The oils in Kuhn 's new show were as forceful and unpolished as the man himself . The portraits of friends like " Miss D " ( who models for Harper 's Bazaar when she has her clothes on ) and circus and vaudeville performers such as Bobby Barry , the white-hatted clown , showed them stiff , direct , and isolated against a dull wall of paint , looking gallerygoers right in the eye . There were paintings of apples that looked almost as round as Cezanne 's , and a crisp turkey lying succulent and helpless in a pan . " I 'm a good cook , " Kuhn explained . " I did that one myself . Painted it in 24 hours straight , and then we ate off it for two weeks . It weighed 30 pounds . " <P> Among the other standouts was a lion head reminiscent of Delacroix . Kuhn said that one started with a painting of two kittens in a basket . " They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better do a lion . My wife reminded me I did n't know anything about lions , so I went up to the Natural History Museum and they loaned me a lion skull . " One still life consisted of a rib roast on a table . " A fellow who knows the Old Masters will eat that one up , " Kuhn averred . " And a beef picture is a good idea nowadays . It 's news ! You see I got ta be a showman . It 's no disgrace to be a showman . " <P> A Sense of Humor . If it is , Kuhn has led a disgraceful life . Born in Greenwich Village , he got his start as a bicycle racer , graduated to inventing and producing vaudeville acts . At the same time he was studying art and selling comic drawings to magazines . " I covered a million miles of paper , " he remembers . " It took me a long time to learn . But now I can draw a picture with my eyes shut . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A young artist ought to make a perfect disease , you know , of drawing everything in sight . He ought to get married-I could n't have gotten along without my wife and daughter-and he should be glad he 's not a genius . Geniuses burn out too early and in this business , guts and a sense of humor are the main ingredients . "
