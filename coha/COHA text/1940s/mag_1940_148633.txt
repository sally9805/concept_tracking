The Protestant Episcopal Church numbers many a human pillar who has been divorced and remarried . Perennially the Church faces a question which will not be downed : What to do about such good people who get civil divorces , wish to remarry in church ? The Episcopal canon on marriage , as liberalized in 1931 , is still strict and specific : rectors may marry only those divorced persons who are 1 ) innocent parties in divorces for adultery ; 2 ) innocent partners in marriages annulled for premarital cause . But not a few parsons , in dioceses with liberal bishops , marry divorcees anyway and get away with it . <P> Two years ago , at the request of the Episcopal House of Bishops , the Woman 's Auxiliary of the Church formed a nine-woman commission to study marriage &; divorce , present their views to the male commission which broods over the question between General Conventions ( next one : next October ) . Chairman of the female commission is the Auxiliary 's Executive Board Chairman Mrs. Robert G. Happ of South Bend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manhattan 's Greenwich House ( settlement ) ; Mrs. Charles Leslie Glenn , wife of the popular rector of Christ Church , Cambridge , Mass. ; Mrs. Norman B. Livermore , San Francisco socialite and clubwoman . <P> Report 's nub : There should be a more thorough preparation by the Church of couples planning Christian marriage . But divorces do take place . " If a divorced person who has been in communion with this Church desires to remarry after a reasonable time and desires , as does the partner of this second marriage , the blessing of the Church , this might well be bestowed when the parish priest or a suitable committee are assured , after examination of the circumstances involved , of the genuine desires and purpose of both participants to lead a Christian life . . . . But no priest unwilling to perform such a ceremony should be required to do so . " <P> Deputies to the General Convention are not only all male , but usually oldish and conservative . The 1937 Convention voted down a less liberal amendment of the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves itself much younger or less conservative .
