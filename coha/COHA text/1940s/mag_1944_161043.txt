Eddie Cantor 's ping-pong eyes and small potato voice have abetted many a vulgar nudge and giggle , but nobody ever thought of suppressing him as a menace to public morals . Nevertheless , last week that is just what happened to him . NBC cut Eddie Cantor off the air , in the middle of his act . In Manhattan he and Singer Nora Martin were telecasting an old tune , We 're Having a Baby , My Baby and Me , which Cantor sang in the 1941-42 Broadway musical , Banjo Eyes . NBC found some of the lyrics and some of the comedian 's bodily illustrations of them , " objectionable . " <P> Blazed Cantor : " I 'm blazing mad at fellows who tell you it 's all right and then sneak around and cut you off . " <P> Almost lost in the shuffle was the fact that the show was the first commercial U.S. telecast by relay . Because television waves , unlike radio waves , are not reflected earthwards from the sky , no station can broadcast beyond its horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sent clearly by telephone wire , and coaxial cable , which does carry them , is unavailable because of the war . So to reach Philadelphia , Philco set up an automatic relay halfway between New York and Philadelphia . This picked up the telecast from NBC 's Manhattan station WNBT , stepped it up to its original power , sent it on for rebroadcast from Philco 's Philadelphia station WPTZ . <P> The relay , which Philco hopes to manufacture if it is adopted , worked well enough , but on prewar television receivers Eddie Cantor 's stifled image was anything but clear .
