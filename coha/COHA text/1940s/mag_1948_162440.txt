Is there any real chance of getting along with the Russians ? Last week , after many long months across U.N . tables from them , Eleanor Roosevelt said yes and told how : <P> " It is a slow business , but we can . It will be because they recognize our strength - material , physical , military . They believe firmly that there is something inherently weak in our form of government and our way of life . They are always surprised when we do n't just collapse . They think we will have a serious depression , and they will reap the result of our folly . If we ca n't get together and prevent that , some of what they say will perhaps be true . If we can prove we believe in our democracy as strongly as they do in their government , if we are willing to sacrifice as much as they are , they will respect every show of strength . <P> " I like the Russians personally , but I know very well they must not get away with anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .
