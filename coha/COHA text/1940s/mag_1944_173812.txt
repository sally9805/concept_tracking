The fur-coated bride was young ( 22 ) , pertly pretty and the " richest girl in the world . " The socialite-playboy groom smiled ecstatically and told reporters : " I assure you that it was love at first sight . . . love at first sight . " Then amateur Sportsman James H. R. Cromwell and his bride , the former Doris Duke , boarded the Italian liner Conte di Savoia , sailed romantically away on an eight-month , round-the-world honeymoon . That was in 1935 . <P> Last December the Reno courts awarded Doris Duke Cromwell a divorce on grounds of cruelty . Jimmy Cromwell marched straight into New Jersey 's Chancery Court . There , last week , he finally succeeded in having the divorce declared null &; void in New Jersey-where Mrs. Cromwell has some $10,000,000 worth of property . Grounds for the court ruling : 1 ) Doris Duke Cromwell had never become a bona fide resident of Nevada , even though she bought a house there ; 2 ) the Nevada court had improperly concealed the evidence in the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states increasingly uncertain . <P> " Shameful and Shocking . " Jimmy Cromwell , son of Philadelphia 's rich &; famed hostess , Mrs. Edward T. Stotesbury , had not been reticent about pleading his case in court . His basic philosophy : " I do n't believe that a marriage license alone suffices to keep a woman in love with her husband . What happened to me can happen in the best regulated families . " <P> The trouble began with politics . Said Jimmy : " You know ... I have always been a good New Dealer . I persuaded Mrs. Cromwell to contribute $50,000 to the Roosevelt campaign in 1940 . Her attorney ... is a good old Republican reactionary and I am sure he helped to poison Mrs. Cromwell 's mind against me . " <P> When Jimmy - presumably on the strength of the $50,000 campaign contribution-was made U.S. Minister to Canada , the Cromwells ' domestic relations continued to deteriorate . Said the Cromwell counsel , State Senator John E. Toolan : " She humiliated him greatly by her indifference " to the responsibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such chores as inspecting a Canadian gold mine ( see cut ) . Her " conduct and her carryings on " were " shameful and shocking . " <P> Back in New Jersey , added Senator Toolan , Mrs. Cromwell subjected her husband to " the acme of refined cruelty . . . when Mr. Cromwell 's valet . . . was compelled to wait several hours . . . because Mr. Cromwell 's bedroom was occupied by his successor in his wife 's affections . " A deposition from Mrs. Stotesbury stated that her daughter-in-law frequently trav eled without Jimmy , " and with companions of which my son deeply disapproved . "
