THE DREAM DEPARTMENT-S . J. Perelman-Random House ( $2 ) . <P> S. J. Perelman picks up business where he left off with Look Who 's Talking ( TIME , Aug. 12 , 1940 ) . One passage should suffice to give traffic signals to such readers as remain unfamiliar with Perelman 's work . The passage was inspired by a notice to the effect that moving pictures would be used for department-store advertising . The title is Kitchenware , Notions , Lights , Action , Camera ! <P> Scene : The music room in the palatial villa of Mrs. Lafcadio Mifflin at Newport . Mrs. Mifflin , a majestic woman in a slim-pin Bemberg corselet well boned over the diaphragm ( Stern Brothers , fourth floor ) , is seated at the console of her Wurlitzer , softly wurlitzing to herself . Mr. Mifflin , in a porous-knit union suit from Franklin Simon 's street floor , is stretched out by the fire like a great , tawny cat . Inasmuch as there is a great , tawny cat stretched out alongside him , also wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mifflin . <P> There are many other pieces under such titles as Beat Me , Post-Impressionist Daddy , Caution-Soft Prose Ahead , Psst , Partner , Your Peristalsis is Showing . They handle , with the expertness required for delivering a two-headed baby , the aching half-lunacies which turn up as a normal part of U.S. life . They use one of the rangiest and most microscopically exact vocabularies in modern letters-a vocabulary drawn entirely from those ancient , current and emergent clichs of which Flaubert and Joyce were both collectors and which are as diagnostic of a civilization as any ten theses on the Zeitgeist , and a thousand times as entertaining . <P> They are , as Perelman 's pieces have been for some years , overformularized ; yet even at their most manufactured they have a surface and a perfection of rhythm which little contemporary prose can touch . At their best , they stand with the best of Ludwig Bemelmans and of James Thurber as a shocking commentary on most of the nominally more solid and earnest books being written in English . <P> The Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week : <P> " Button-cute , rapier-keen , wafer-thin , and pauper-poor is S. J. Perelman , whose tall , stooping figure is better known to the twilit half-world of five continents than to Publishers ' Row . That he possesses the power to become invisible to finance companies ; that his laboratory is tooled up to manufacture Frankenstein-type monsters on an incredible scale ; and that he owns one of the rare mouths in which butter has never melted are legends treasured by every schoolboy . <P> " Perelman 's life reads like a picaresque novel . It began on a bleak shelf of rock in mid-Atlantic near Tristan da Cunha . Transplanted to Rhode Island by a passing Portuguese , he became a man of proverbial strength around the Providence wharves ; he could drive a spike through an oak plank with his fist . As there was constant need for this type of skilled labor , he soon acquired enough tuition to enter Brown University . He is chiefly remembered there for translating the epigrams of Martial into colloquial Amharic and designing Brooks Bros. ' present trademark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
