Across a red brick factory near Providence , R.I. a huge sign sprawls : UNIVERSAL WINDING co. , WORLD 'S LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF TEXTILE WINDING MACHINES . <P> Behind that peaceful boast , a miracle in production-for-war was being worked last week . Nine months from scratch-in just half the time normally necessary for production preliminaries-Universal assembled the first service models of a new military rifle . <P> The rifle : Captain ( Marine Corps Reserve ) Melvin Maynard Johnson 's famed semiautomatic . Up to last week this gun had existed only in a few experimental models . On a subcontract let by Inventor Johnson last November , Universal had manufactured these first Johnsons for The Netherlands East Indies ' 150,000 troops ( including its Home Guard Army ) , which may soon need all the modern weapons they can get to use against the ambitious Japanese . Close behind an initial production block of 100 rifles come 500 more this week , with still larger outputs of 1,000 to 2,000 to come . Also in parts production at Universal , soon due for the first assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder-fired machine gun , which The Netherlands East Indies has also ordered in quantity . <P> Armament production to protect East India rubber , tin , oil , is of immediate defense concern to the U.S. So is the fact that Universal 's new , rapidly expanding rifle and machine-gun capacity could , in case of need , be turned to making guns for U.S. defense . Equally important , providing many a valuable lesson for other emergency producers , is the way Universal sped into production . <P> Spark plug of this achievement was Universal 's pudgy , tireless Works Manager William A. Ruhl ( who used to make Nash automobiles ) . When Universal contracted to manufacture Johnson parts last year , Bill Ruhl lacked tools and materials , had no priority status whatsoever to help get them . By airplane , train , telephone he ransacked the already overburdened machine-tool market , just as many another tool-hungry competitor was doing . <P> But Bill Ruhl did more : he found ways to turn scores of his textile tools to the production of gun parts . Throughout Universal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out parts for textile winders , parts for Johnsons . Example : the same tools last week were spitting out pulleys for the winders , cams for the rifles . <P> Manager Ruhl had never made a gun or a gun part . Nor , so far as he knew , had any of his workmen . The specialized knowledge had to come from Inventor Johnson himself and from the boss of his barrel shop , an acidulous , gun-goofy Swede named Carl Ekdahl . By their joint ingenuity Johnson , Ekdahl , Ruhl &; Co. had by last week piled up 5,300 finished barrels , 11,000 more barrels in process , 10,000 breech bolts , hundreds and thousands of other parts , before a gun was assembled .
