For exactly eight days-between the Paris Conference 's end and the convening of the U.N . ' s General Assembly in New York-the world had a chance to draw breath , to look both backward &; forward along the rough road it was traveling . The peacemakers and world rebuilders were , most of them , in transit ( see below ) . The world 's troubles rode with them every mile . <P> Looking backward , the most important event of the year , between the United Nations Assembly meeting at London and its second sitting this week in New York , was the clarification of U.S. foreign policy . A year ago neither the friends nor the antagonists of the U.S. had a clear idea of where the U.S. stood . Today the world sees the U.S. as a leading champion among the great powers of a strong United Nations and as an active participant in the discussion of every international issue , from Stettin around to Harbin . <P> In its relations with Russia , the U.S. has rejected two extreme views of what Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Henry Wallace and William C. Bullitt ( ex-Ambassador to Moscow ) . The Wallace view , in brief , was that , once Russia feels secure against attack , she will stop expanding and start providing the long-promised socialist Utopia for her own people . The Bullitt view was that the Bolshevik leaders are irrevocably committed by the " Communist creed " to world domination , and that nothing will stop them but force , the sooner applied , the better . <P> The view which won out over both of these was that the Kremlin could not be appeased , but that it might be dealt with , because its masters do not want war in the near future ; that Moscow 's policy was not an implacable plan but an opportunistic scheme of expanding where weakness shows up , stopping in the face of strength . <P> Looking forward , the world could expect its politics to turn around the interplay of Russian expansionism v. the U.S. policy of " patience and firmness.
