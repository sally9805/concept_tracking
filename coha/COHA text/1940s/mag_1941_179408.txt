Muddling Britons last week managed a neat insult to their ally Soviet Russia . On his way to Washington , Russia 's newly appointed Ambassador Maxim Litvinoff flew into Teheran , tried to fly on to Cairo in a British Overseas Airways plane . But chubby Ambassador Litvinoff was stopped at the steps to the plane with the information : " All seats already have been taken . " <P> Ambassador Litvinoff 's genial old billikin face turned purple . His snowy-haired English wife , Ivy Litvinoff , confusedly asked : " Are we going , papa ? " As the plane loaded with Britons took off without the Litvinoffs , it was apparent that a first-class diplomatic incident had occurred . <P> Later Ambassador Litvinoff cooled somewhat and flew off in the Russian war plane that had brought him from Samara . The British Government was all apology . London reports said that prior to the incident Ambassador Litvinoff had refused passage in a special R.A.F. plane , declaring that the seats were not suitable , and that the Russian Embassy at Teheran had been informed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicting with the Teheran dispatches , claimed that the plane was already in the air when the Ambassador arrived at the airport . <P> While the British Government investigrated , the London Evening Standard broached the whole unsavory subject of plane priorities , said : " One hears of Sir Samuel Hoare 's butler , Lady Reading 's secretary-chauffeuse , the eleven-year-old son of the Marquess of Queensberry . . . all taking up space in the Lisbon Clipper . . . causing important British and American citizens to be delayed at Lisbon .
