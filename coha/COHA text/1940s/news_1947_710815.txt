Petrillo , president of the American Federation of Musicians , today banned . once and for all " the making of recordings and transcriptions by the union 's 225,000 members in the United States and Canada . He said the step was unanimously approved by the executive board of the union , which is an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor , after a five-day meeting . It was designed eventually to increase the employment of musicians , but Mr. Petrillo estimated that it now meant an annual loss of about $5,000,000 in wages . The action , which is viewed as affecting the economic future of the broadcasting , phonograph and juke box industries as well as that of union musicians , was the third holding serious implications for the broadcasting industry taken by Mr. Petrillo in recent months . The first was his edict against duplication of musical programs on both standard and frequency modulation stations . This was followed by a ban on the appearance of " live " musicians over F.M . networks , which was made while the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 17 . Regarding the legal status of the ban on recordings under the Lea Act and the Taft-Hartley Act , it was believed in Washington that no law can stop persons from terminating their employment relationship and all collateral rights . Mr. Petrillo 's lawyers say  --  that he has ? a right to go out of business . The ban on recordings is effective Dec. 31 , when the union 's contracts with the recording companies expire . In announcing his board 's decision , made on Thursday , Mr. Petrillo said : ' We 're quitting . Members of the American Federation of Musicians in the United States and Canada are determined once and for all that they will not make the instrument that will eventually destroy them . They realize that in making recordings and transcriptions they 're making their own popular music . There will be no new Mt each week or each month . Juke boxes will have to retain old favorites and sales over the counter for home use will be repressings of old recordings , Mr. Petrillo said . He said he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz would feel the ban so severely . " The classical music lasts , " he added , explaining that old recordings of such music retain popularity longer . Interpretation of some points of the ban is yet to be made , Mr. Petrillo said . He cited what are known as " reference recordings " made for correcting an orchestral performance . As an example , if the director of the Chicago Symphony desired to have a recording made of a performance of the orchestra so that // competition , which would destroy them . " We do n't know of another business in this country that would make an instrument that would destroy it . We 're taking the same position . " The announcement means that no new recordings for broacast , home use , juke boxes or any other purpose will be available after this year . The practice of some radio stars of recording broadcasts ahead of broadcast time will be stopped , Mr. Petrillo said in explaining the move . " That does n't mean we wo n't be willing to play at the broadcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " It he might play it back and point up sections for future performances , he might be allowed to do so . " Individual cases will have to be worked out , " Mr. Petrillo said . Asked whether a recording firm such as , Columbia would be allowed to ' record a concert by the Chicago Symphony in Orchestra Hall , Mr. Petrillo replied : " definitely not . " Mr. Petrillo said that his executive board had long studied the . ban . For a time , he said , there were two possibilities : to stop all recordings or to form an organization of musicians to make and sell recordings . ' The latter plan was dropped , he said , when the union 's lawyers ruled that such a practice would involve anti-trust violations . " If we could make them ourselves we could say where they were going and who was going to use them , " Mr. Petrillo said , " but that would get us in trouble with the anti-trust laws . " Under the current contract with the recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , amounting to about $2 , - 000,000 a year . Under the TaftHartley labor act such a contract can not be renewed for next year . The royalty contract was brought about by a twenty-seven-month ban on record making by the union which began in August , 1942 , and ended in November , 1944 . During that period record companies re-issued old discs and brought back into favor many old popular songs . As for the reported ban on " live " musicians on F.M. , Mr. Petrillo said that F.M . broadcasters " can have all the musicians they want if they pay for them . All they have to do is negotiate with our local A.F.M. locals . " Mr. Petrillo asserted that the ban on simultaneous broadcasting by A. M. and F. M. networks was still in effect . He advised the broadcasting companies to meet the scales of A. F. M. local unions and thus engage the musicians .

If convicted , Mr. Petrillo would be subject to a fine of $1,000 or a year in jail or both --  , ' Showdown " Seen in Move Mr. Petrillo 's ban on the making of records and transcriptions was regarded here by radio and recording officials as the opening move in what promises to be a " showdown " between the union and the entire " canned music " industry , including standard radio , FM radio , ' television , phonograph records and electrical transcriptions . The move had been expected for more than a month by industry officials , but none was willing last night to make formal comment pending an opportunity to study Mr. Petrillo 's announcement . Informally , however , the officials were agreed that the Petrillo ban presented " a unique situation " which ultimately might take further Congressional action to resolve . The officials noted that Mr. Petrillo first made known his intention to stop the manufacture of disks immediately after passage of the Taft-Hartley Law . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petrillo set up after ' ie brought the entire record " rig industry to a halt several years : go . The musicians ' fund has been inanced by imposition of a fee on ach disk sold , amounting annually to more than $2,000,000 . " What we face is the fact that a law designed to help us is being used by a union to put us out of business , " said one recording official . " The only way we can stay in business apparently is to find some way to circumvent that law . " The timing of Mr. Petrillo 's edict against virtually all forms of " canned music " except the sound tracks- of films was conceded by both union and industry officials to be linked with the expiration dates of the federation 's major contracts . AU record and transcription pacts will have expired by Dec. 31 . On Jan. 31 the agreements between the union and the-major networks also run out .
