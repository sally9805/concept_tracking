Day after day since the middle of January they had trooped in &; out of quiet rooms in the Natural History Building , the Tariff Commission Building , the Government Auditorium and the National Archives Building in Washington . They were laden with briefcases , burdened with worries . Day after day they made their speeches to patiently attentive Government men . <P> They were the U.S. oil industry , the lumber industry ; the coal interests , the copper interests ; the tobacco growers , the potato growers ; the manufacturers of jewelry , and of fishing tackle . None of them had a complete understanding of all the ramifications of the problems they discussed . But most of them were certain that their industries faced ruin if the U.S. continued to lower its tariff walls . <P> The men who listened to them , from 10 in the morning until ( frequently ) 9 at night , were representatives of State , War , Navy , Treasury , Agriculture and the Tariff Commission , sitting as subcommittees of the Committee for Reciprocity Information . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to write a tariff policy , on which all postwar foreign policy depends . <P> Geneva In the Spring . Since trade is a two-way street , that policy could not be conclusive . The importance of what the U.S. laid on the line would be measured in the end by what the rest of the world was ready to accept . The rest of the world had its own problems and objectives . But it was the U.S. which would make the first offer , and last week the rest of the world watched with closest interest . <P> The basis of the U.S. State Department 's policy would be Cordell Hull 's 1934 Trade Agreements Act . With that Act Hull had attacked the economic nationalism of high tariffs-not only in the U.S. but in all countries . Hull did not advocate unrestricted free trade but trade free of " malignant restrictions ' ' ; he demanded reasonable tariffs reduced reciprocally for mutual benefit . This was the delicate flower which Under Secretary of State Will Clayton now cultivated . <P> In April , Clayton 's experts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations and try to write the most ambitious contract for reciprocal lowering of tariffs the world has seen , and lay the foundation of an International Trade Organization . Every one of the 17 nations which will grant the U.S. greater access to their markets will be granted the same access to U.S. markets . Under the 1945 extension of the Trade Agreements Act , State can , without congressional approval , cut Jan. i , 1945 tariff rates up to 50% . <P> State , in other words , would open the U.S. 's end of the street to any nation which would do likewise . State would demand relaxation of export-import controls , preferential tariffs , bilateral barter and other devices by which the war-torn countries of the world have sought economic security . State would demand the relaxation of state trading monopolies .
