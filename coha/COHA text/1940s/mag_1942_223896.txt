One day in 1902 a mop-headed , bumptious , 22-year-old sculpture student from Manhattan 's East Side collected $400 for illustrating a book by Hutchins Hapgood . On this , he bought a ticket to Paris , where during his first few weeks he : <P> &gt; Attended Emile Zola 's funeral at Montmartre . <P> &gt; Knocked a deaf &; dumb Gascon head-over-heels among the modeling stands . <P> &gt; Quit his anatomy class at the sight of a " slightly green object " - an arm from a corpse . <P> The ebullient boy was Sculptor Jacob Epstein . <P> Last week appeared the first objective and fully illustrated study of this most controversial modern sculptor ( now 62 ) to be written and published in the U.S. Author is Robert Black , art editor for Manhattan 's Illustrated Editions . Sculptor Epstein once wrote a one-line introduction for a catalogue of one of his exhibitions : " I rest silent in my work . " Equally content to rest in the master 's work , Author Black chiefly tries to answer two questions about Epstein : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of The Art of Jacob Epstein ( The World Publishing Co. ; $3.50 ) is made up of 100 photographs of the sculptor 's provocative statues ; 75 reproductions of his less familiar drawings of lushly reclining odalisques . <P> The Epstein career has proceeded by a mounting series of sensations . It began in 1908 . Commissioned to sculpt decorations for the British Medical Association Building , Epstein spent 14 frantic months suspended on a scaffold high above London 's busy Strand . When the scaffolding was removed from his first five oversized nudes , the storm broke . Wrote the Evening Standard on page 1 : " It is unnecessary to say any more than that they are a form of statuary which no careful father would wish his daughter , or no discriminating young man , his fiance , to see . " Result : for thousands of careful fathers who stared upward from the Strand , stiff necks ; for Sculptor Epstein , fame . <P> Next sensation broke in Paris . In 1909 Epstein was commissioned to carve a figure for Oscar Wilde 's tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months in London carving " a demon-angel , in full flight across the face of the world , " transported the work to Paris . The French were even more shocked than the English . Says Author Black : " This simplified and symbolic statue was violently objected to because it possessed genitals . " To the fury of Critic Remy de Gourmont , author of a famed biological theory of esthetics , puritanical Frenchmen covered the offending fact with a large bronze fig leaf . <P> Then there was Epstein 's Christ , which one outraged cleric compared ( with Empire inclusiveness ) to " some degraded Chaldean or African . . . an Asiatic , American or Hun . . . some emaciated Hindu or badly grown Egyptian . " <P> There was also his seven-foot , simian , pink alabaster Adam , sometimes referred to as " a biologist 's nightmare " or " three tons of ugliness . " An Australian gold miner bought Adam for $35,000 . For like Epstein notoriety , Epstein prices have soared steadily upward .
