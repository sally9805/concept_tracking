Hollywood could never cast Columnist Joseph Wright Alsop Jr . in its stock role of the slouch-hatted , wisecracking newsman . He does not look the part , and he was not brought up to play it . Instead of the rough- &-tumble; school of the police beat , he went to Groton and Harvard , where he wandered around with volumes of Proust and Joyce under his arm and thought politics beneath discussion . His silk shirts and tailored suits are as out of character as his high-pitched " ah there " voice . He exudes a cultivated and imperious air . <P> Notwithstanding his man-of-distinction look , Joe Alsop is a journalist , and a good one . His political acumen ( the result of well-applied apprentice years ) and his writing ( a clear cut above the loose or labored journalese of many colleagues ) have earned him a reputation as one of the half-dozen best commentators in the U.S. <P> Two for the Money . Last week the 102nd paper signed up to buy Joseph and Stewart Alsop 's column of erudite background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The editors got two pundits for the price of one : while Joe was realistically sizing up Dewey and Stassen in Oregon this month , Stewart was appraising the " twilight terror " in Czechoslovakia . <P> Joe Alsop , now a thin-haired 37 , became a journalist when his wealthy Connecticut family ( kin to the Oyster Bay Roosevelts ) decided that its fat and bookish son was good for nothing else . A discreetly pulled wire got him a job with the New York Herald Tribune . In its Washington bureau , where his first official appearance was at a White House party , he found politics more fun than Proust . <P> His reporting and writing soon won him an offer from North American Newspaper Alliance to do a column . His four-year partnership with Robert Kintner , capped by their American White Paper ( TIME , April 29 , 1940 ) , ended with the war . In the course of a hectic service career Joe served under Chennault , became a young China hand , was interned by the Japanese at Hong Kong . There he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repatriation by learning to read the Analects of Confucius in the original . <P> It Pays to Reduce . Stewart Alsop , three years younger than his brother Joe , went to Groton and Yale , fought a more exciting war . He began with the British army , wound up with the French Maquis and a British bride . Until he teamed up with Joe , he had never written a news line . <P> Besides their two columns a week apiece , the team adds to its income ( upwards of $30,000 ) by turning out half a dozen magazine articles a year . ( In 1937 the doctors sent Joe to Johns Hopkins to reduce from a vast 240 Ibs. to a neater 175 . To pay the bill , he smartly dashed off a piece on reducing , sold it to the Saturday Evening Post . ) <P> " In my pompous way , " smiles Joe , " I conceived ours as a column of information - halfway between pure opinion and what is essentially gossip . I felt there had been no formula for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
