Just when the fight fans had about given up hope , the Big Fight got a green light . The War Department last week sanctioned a return match-at Yankee Stadium Oct. 12-between Sergeant Joe Louis , world 's heavyweight champion , and Private Billy Conn , the Pittsburgh toughie who , a year ago last June , succeeded in confounding the champ for a good part of twelve rounds before going the way of all challengers . Beneficiary of the fight : Army Relief . Neither fighter will collect a cent . <P> Louis has n't laced on a boxing glove since he began cavalry training at Fort Riley three months ago . Conn 's last fight was a bare-knuckle brawl in which he broke his left hand on his father-in-law 's head . But when these two fighting men go into action , ringsiders expect a dime thriller for their $40 pasteboards . <P> Conn , a notorious night owl , will probably enter the ring a better man than last time . Army life has put him in the pink of condition , added 15 Ib. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed 174 to Louis ' 200 ) . At 24 , he should be at the peak of his fistic career . Always slow at getting himself into fighting shape , Louis has been hindered , not helped , by the cavalry . Used to training for six weeks or more , he may find four weeks too short to get his fill of roadwork before starting to sharpen his timing . <P> " Poor Joe , " crowed Conn . " He 's going on 29 and has n't had a fight since he knocked out Abe Simon last March . In my book Joe 's a dead pigeon . " <P> If Louis ' 21st defense of his title should indeed be his last , plenty of fans will be in on the kill . As they beelined for tickets last week Promoter Mike Jacobs promised the Army a gross gate of $1,200,000-the first million-dollar gate since Louis knocked out Max Schmeling in 1938.
