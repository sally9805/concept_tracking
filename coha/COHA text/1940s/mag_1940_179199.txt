Modern teachers believe that dull children are worth cultivating , have shown that with proper encouragement a sub-par child may produce remarkable paintings , sculpture , craftsmanship . They have been less successful in teaching such children to read and write . <P> Leon Ormond , a teacher in the Arts High School of Newark , N. J. , has two classes of children with I. Q.s of 80 or less . Their reading is poor , their spelling worse . But Teacher Ormond encouraged them to write verses . Last week he triumphantly reported that near-morons can write . To prove it he published uncorrected samples of their poetry in The Clearing House , an educational magazine . Sample : <P> I saw the clouds last nihgt in the sky , <P> Paked close together like people on a street , <P> Looking about for something yet nothing <P> At all . Waiting and wating for something <P> Yet nothing at all . Then all of a suddin <P> The rain came down , huge bukets <P> Of water poring thier strenght on all <P> The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these clouds in god 's great sky- <P> Seamingly not knowing what to do and <P> Then of a suddin making the desision . <P> Poring out all strengthe that life may be better ; <P> But sometimes distroying the good they have done before . <P> Mr. Ormond concluded that a dull child may be " every bit as imaginative " as a brighter one , has certain advantages as a poet : 1 ) because he has read less , his poetry is innocent of cliches ; 2 ) because his reactions are more primitive ( " He is more apt to be a jitterbug " ) , his poetry has rhythm .
