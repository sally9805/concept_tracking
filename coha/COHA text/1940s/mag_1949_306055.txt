The U.S. public , forever hopeful of finding a cure for the common cold , was eagerly buying newfangled pills last week . The drugs , heretofore available only on a doctor 's prescription , were selling over drug counters as fast and freely as bubble gum . <P> The drugs were anti-histaminics , developed in the last few years for relief of allergies ( notably hay fever and asthma ) . Because they set off such side effects as drowsiness and dizziness in some patients , the Food &; Drug Administration had kept them on the prescription list . Doctors , noting that many cold symptoms seem to be allergic in nature , have tried the anti-histaminics on cold sufferers , but the varied results left them far from enthusiastic . <P> All In Favor ? Drug manufacturers , catering to the hopeful eagerness of snifflers , have been trying to find an anti-histaminic which would not cause side effects . The Nepera Chemical Co. of Yonkers , N.Y . came close with neohetramine . Several doctors reported it less toxic , and toxic to fewer people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September the Food &; Drug Administration , satisfied that the average customer would not be upset by the recommended dosage , authorized its sale over the counter . <P> Last week , under the trade name of Anahist , neohetramine was being advertised and sold as a preventive and cure for the common cold . Other drug companies were scrambling for a piece of this obviously rich market . An affiliate of the Schering Corp . was pushing another anti-histaminic under the name Inhiston , and more trade-named cold pills were due any day . <P> Neohetramine did show encouraging results last winter when it was elaborately tested , under ideal testing conditions , in Sing Sing prison , in a convent and in a girls ' seminary . Of 200 patients who got the recommended dosage , 182 had no colds all winter , 13 mild colds were nipped in the bud , and only four bad colds developed . Among the 300 untreated controls , only 59 were cold-free and 179 had bad ones . <P> Maybe Not . Despite all the impressive tests , some doctors were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most men &; women do not get as much rest and will not dose themselves as carefully and regularly as the selected patients . Some doctors pointed to the danger of overdosing ; e.g. , a man who tries to cure a cold double-quick by doubling the recommended dose may get drowsy and fall asleep while driving . <P> The still unsettled point is the relationship between colds and allergies , though doctors admit that a layman does n't much care what ails him , so long as he is promptly cured . Dr. William J. Kerr of the University of California 's Medical School , a top authority on the subject , believes that only 25% of cold symptoms are due to allergy . Arguing from this thesis , he takes a dim view of anti-histaminics as cold cures . Said he : " To get one shot out of four would n't be very good hunting-and it 's lousy medicine .
