txt Gasoline and Rubber Wasted A letter published in your current edition complained of gasoline waste due to idling of bus motors at terminal points . This is bad , but is topped by the thousands of heavy trucks in the city whose motors never stop from morning to night because they would have to be cranked . The gross result must be thousands of idling hours for the motors in these vehicles , with incredible waste of fuel . A number of motorists still go in for cowboy starts , even with a red light a block away , necessitating an equally quick stop when reached . Several miles of rubber are worn out in a few hundred feet by this procedure . This same type of citizen may still be observed rounding curves at high speed , his tires protesting in loud squeals . Will the police please take notice ? D. Q. New York , July 1 , 1942.
