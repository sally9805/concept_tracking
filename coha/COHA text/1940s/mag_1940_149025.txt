When France fell , jubilant Nazi agents in the U. S. announced that from now on Germany would begin to get tough with the U. S. They even named a date when tough talk and tougher action would begin-Aug. 10 , three months after the invasion of the Low Countries . <P> Last week it was apparent that the tough talk had started well ahead of schedule . It was not very impressive to begin with . Fortnight ago Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop launched an attack on the Monroe Doctrine on the eve of the Havana Conference ( TIME , July 15 ) . Last week Secretary of State Cordell Hull , before setting out for Havana with eight trade , monetary , agricultural and political experts , slapped back at another attempt to make trouble . From Costa Rica , Guatemala and Nicaragua came reports that Dr. Otto Reinebeck , German Minister to the Central American Republics , had circulated a note of warning among the small but touchy nations that lie near the Panama Canal . <P> One distinction of Cordell Hull 's term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin-American Conferences . Almost singlehanded he saved the seventh Pan American Conference of 1933 at Montevideo , unobtrusively calling on Latin-American Foreign Ministers with a personal good-neighborliness that disarmed suspicion . When Mr. Hull flared up at the new Nazi attempt to influence the Conference , he used a tough word : he called it " intimidation . " There was no theory , he said , on which any nation could attack the Havana meeting ; there was no reason for any nation to attack the sovereign rights of the countries involved . That sounded good in Central America . President Carias of Honduras praised Secretary Hull 's tough talk ; Central Americans announced that they were paying no attention to the German warning . <P> Cartel . The character of the U. S. delegation made it plain that the U.S. viewed the biggest Nazi threat in South America as economic . No U.S. military or naval experts were going . With Secretary Hull went Adolf Berle , Assistant Secretary of State , creator of the cartel plan by which the U. S. would block Nazi pressures on South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones ; Agriculture sent its Director of Foreign Agricultural Relations , Leslie Wheeler ; the Treasury sent its monetary expert , close-mouthed Harry White . State Department technicians included young Laurence Duggan , who became chief of the Division of American Republics when only 30 . But the mission was full of seasoned oldsters like 54-year-old William Dawson , Ambassador to Panama ; 57-year-old Legal Expert Green Hackworth . <P> Whether these men could achieve anything depended on more than Latin-American reaction to the U. S. cartel plan . Jesse Cottrell , Washington correspondent and onetime Minister to Bolivia , flatly declared that they could , gave an imposing list of reasons . Said he : responsible Latin-Americans want to be united in a " stop Hitler " drive . If the U.S. makes as vast a readjustment as is called for by a $5,000,000,000 cartel , the Conference will also provide for : <P> 1 ) Reaffirmation of the Good-Neighbor policy . <P> 2 ) Approval of the Monroe Doctrine . <P> 3 ) Pan-American cooperation in taking over Dutch , French and British possessions if threatened by Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20 Republics , cooperating with the U. S.
