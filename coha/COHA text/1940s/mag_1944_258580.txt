While U.S. tanks clanked into the suburbs of Paris , the London News Chronicle 's political correspondent , E. P. Montgomery , brooded over a nightmare that worries a lot of other people : by going underground the Nazis might be able to prolong the war indefinitely . <P> Groaned Correspondent Montgomery : " The war in Germany will go on-underground . Allied military patrols will be ambushed . . . administrators assassinated . . . commanders will die mysteriously . . . . Hitler and the Nazis-particularly Himmler-have learned from their own bitter experience how effective the underground resistance can be . . . . <P> " There will be a strange reluctance on the part of every German to accept any post of responsibility under the Allied military authorities . A Nazi equivalent of our word ' quisling ' will be invented and whispered from mouth to mouth , and when one or two of them have been found beaten to death with the most fiendish tortures , every ' good ' German will know what it means . . . . <P> " The Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope that eventually the Allied Governments will get so sick of it they will withdraw their occupying forces , leaving Germany once more to what is left of the Nazis . . . . It is not a pretty prospect , this war without end the Nazis are planning . " <P> Correspondent Montgomery may have underestimated the difficulty of maintaining an underground movement without support from outside . But he had pointed up one possibility : all the shooting of this war may not end abruptly on one happy Armistice Day when people can hang out flags and dance in the streets .
