Doctors do not know the cause of cancer , nor can they prevent a tumor from spreading and migrating . Their only hope , in treating the disease , is to catch a malignant tumor early , burn it with X-ray or cut it out . Last week , in the Archives of Surgery , Dr. Frederick Madison Allen of Manhattan 's Polyclinic Hospital suggested a new way of killing cancers : suffocation . <P> Several years ago , Dr. Allen broke down large cancerous tumors in mice , rats and dogs by tying off , for short periods of time , the arteries which fed the tumors with blood and oxygen . For some unknown reason the normal tissues surrounding the tumors were not affected by lack of nourishment . <P> Dr. Allen next tried choking off a human tumor . For his subject he chose a 76-year-old man with a large funguslike growth on his cheek , just in front of his ear . Working with Dr. Allen , Surgeon Robert Emery Brennan gave the patient a local anesthetic , punctured the skin around the margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tied off the arteries that supplied the tumor with blood . After an hour and a half , when the tumor had darkened slightly , the ligatures were untied . <P> Four days later Dr. Brennan " burrowed deeply " under the tumor , tied off the arteries again , deprived the tumor of nourishment for three and a quarter hours . Shortly afterward the tumor began to slough off . Normal tissues surrounding the growth , which also had their blood supply cut off , were not injured . <P> After the tumor peeled off , the patient was troubled with a new growth the size of " a large lima bean . " When the doctors injected into it an arsenic compound , the lump disappeared in a few days . The patient lived " free from tumor " for two years , finally died of heart failure . <P> " This entire work , " Dr. Allen warned , " is strictly in an experimental stage . " Often it is impossible to tie off blood vessels and the treatment can be used only for certain localized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be " asphyxiated " by other means . He urged that research be continued on treatment combining X-ray and artificially induced inflammation .
