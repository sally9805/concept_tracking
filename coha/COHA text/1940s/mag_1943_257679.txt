Ever since Vice President Henry Agard Wallace made his first major speech on post-war problems last May , critics have tried to make him sound like a starry-eyed global godfather whose only interest was a quart of milk for every Hottentot . Last week gentle Henry Wallace , using harsher language than he likes , struck back with some telling blows-and managed to bring out some of the simple elements of national self-interest in his program . <P> Said Henry Wallace , in a radio broadcast : " Among the self-styled ' realists ' who are trying to scare the American people by spreading worry about ' misguided idealists ' giving away United States products are some whose policies caused us to give away billions of dollars of stuff in the decade of the ' 20s . Their high tariff prevented exchange of our surplus goods . And so we exchanged our surplus for bonds of very doubtful value . <P> " Our surplus will be far greater than ever within a few years after this war comes to an end . We can be decently human and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for peace and for improving the standards of living of so-called backward peoples . We can get more for our surplus production in this way than by any high-tariff , penny-pinching , isolationist policies which hide under the cloak of 100% Americanism . <P> " Self-interest alone should be enough to make the United States deeply concerned with the contentment and well-being of other peoples of the world . For . . . a world family of nations can not be really healthy unless the various nations in that family are getting along well in their own internal affairs . " <P> The Specifics . To keep the world family healthy , Wallace suggested a far sharper program than he presented in May : &gt;For the international unity that is a requisite of peace , the United Nations will need 1 ) machinery to keep aggressor nations disarmed , 2 ) machinery to prevent economic warfare , 3 ) " probably " an international court to settle disputes , 4 ) a world council , " so that whatever world system evolves will have enough flexibility to meet changing circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional problems should be left in regional hands . " The aim would be the maximum of home rule that can be maintained along with the minimum of centralized authority that must come into existence to give the necessary protection . " &gt; " The United Nations must back up military disarmament with psychological disarmament-supervision , or at least inspection , of the school systems of Germany and Japan ... " &gt; " The first concern of each nation must be the well-being of its own people . That is as true of the United States as of any other nation . Maintenance of full employment and the highest possible level of national income should be the joint responsibility of private business and of government . . . . When the war is over , the more quickly private enterprise gets back into peacetime production and sells its goods to peacetime markets here and abroad , the more quickly will the level of government wartime expenditures be reduced . ...
