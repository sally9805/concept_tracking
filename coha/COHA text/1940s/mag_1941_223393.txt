" If I could shake a few OPMites , I could get enough lead out of their pants to last us for a year , " said an angry foilmaker last week . With this and more reasoned squawks , they got enough for a month . Four days after Priorities Director Don Nelson had banned the use of lead and tin foil for cigaret , candy , chewing-gum and other wrapping , the order was rescinded for 30 days . <P> The foilmakers had indeed shaken the OPMites . They were sore . The curtailment order had come with practically no warning : no foilmaking for these uses after Jan. 15 , on the grounds that the foilmakers ( using lead as a substitute for aluminum ) had tripled their lead consumption , and were eating into the supply of lead for defense . Reynolds Metal Co. , largest U.S. foilmaker , was the sorest . Richard Samuel Reynolds felt the order was aimed straight at him . So he drew up a bill of particulars : <P> The lead shortage was not a shortage for defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foil while permitting its use for toy soldiers , sinkers for fishermen , ammunition for sportsmen ? <P> Reynolds had developed a process which cuts by one-half the amount of lead needed in foil making . To keep at work its 1,600 employes it needed only 2,500 tons a month , 3% of available supply . <P> This 3% could easily be obtained from increased production if Leon Henderson would lift the price ceiling a few notches from its present 5.85 a lb . ( TIME , Nov. 17 ) . Mine production could be upped by 30% , said Reynolds , as demonstrated in the 1925-26 period when lead prices climbed . <P> <P> To support the claims came telegraphic testimonials from Reynolds ' customers : Liggett and Myers , American Tobacco , P. Lorillard , Life Savers , Hershey Chocolate Corp . Their production would be hampered , they wired , if they could get no Reynolds foil . <P> Candy and tobacco , it so happened , are among the non-defense industries which Leon Henderson has named as capable of useful , harmless expansion despite defense , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . It also happened that Reynolds , because of his venture into the aluminum business in competition with Alcoa , has been a New Deal darling ; last week he said darkly that his profitable foil business made possible his aluminum program , if foilmaking were cut off his credit might be impaired . In any case , the foilmakers got a reprieve . <P> Less successful were funeral directors and coffinmakers . They showered OPM with telegrams of protest against the recent ban on copper , claiming that burials in bronze caskets are vital to U.S. morale . No soap .
