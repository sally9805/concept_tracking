txt Secretary of State Marshall urged Congress today to authorize promptly $275,000,000 of additional expenditures for continued and sustained military aid to Greece and Turkey in resisting communism . If the lines of supplies to Greece are to remain unbroken , Mr. Marshall said , more funds are required by April 1 . His proposal would extend the military aid through June 30 , 1919 . It was learned , meanwhile , that President Truman would soon shift Ambassador Lincoln from Greece to Portugal . Friction between Mr. and Dwight P. Griswold , chief of the United States Mission for Aid to Greece , has been blamed in some quarters for hampering the administration of the aid program . Secretary Marshall told his news conference today that the Lisbon post , recently vacated by the transfer of Ambassador John C. Wiley to Iran , would be filled soon . Mr. is now in the United States . In identical communications to the top-ranking officers of the Senate and House , the Secretary - of Statd spoke bluntly of the situation in the Mediterranean . The $400,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May will expire this June unless new funds are voted . " The totalitarian groups whose aggressive aims have thus far been frustrated by the continued existence of a free Greece and a free Turkey are convinced that time will play into their hands , " Secretary Marshall wrote . " Their leaders state ' with assurance that the United states will soon tire of giving aid to far-off Mediterranian countries , and that eventually they will be able to take over by default . " It is my belief , however , that the Congress and the American people are unwilling to abandon the Greek and Turkish people at a time when a foundation is being laid which will enable them to stand their own ground without outside aid . " It is in my judgment definitely in our self-interest as a nation and consistent with the principles - of the United Nations Charter to help these , free people retain their freedom . " A world in which it is possible for indirect aggression to deprive nations of their inherent right to pursue their peaceful national existence would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so recently fought to preserve . " Secretary Marshall 's letters were addressed to Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg , President pro tempore of the Senate and chairman of its Foreign Relations Committee , and Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr . of the House . the letters reached the Capitol only a few hours after Secretary Marshall had spent two hours in closed session with the Foreign Relations Committee outlining policy and answering questions relating to the proposed $570,000,000 program to aid China in a situation of " rapid economic deterioration " and ' " Communist threat . " From the Senate committee meeting there appeared to develop a committee attitude that indicated the following as to the China-aid program : That the recommended $570,000,000 ? with $510,000,000 to cover minimum imports of essential relief foodstuffs and raw materials and $60,000,000 for key self-help reconstruction projects ? would be all . That this providing of " a breathing space " in the midst of " fantastic " inflation and political and ideological turmoil would not be a continuing program , but one from which China must " do the rest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct from the military aid aspects of the program for Greece and Turkey . Any amalgamation , it was held by committee members , might cast the United States into the midst of the Chinese civil war , a thing that should be avoided resolutely . That the Chiang Kai-shek Government already was receiving military assistance from the United States ? in materiel drawn from war surpluses in the Pacific in addition to large contractual I orders ? in volume far beyond the previous knowledge of Congress . miat United States advice as to adequate training of Nationalist troops before taking the field against the Communists had been largely ignored , much to the disadvantage of the Nationalist Government . Senators Schedule Action The Senate Foreign Relations Committe will meet Saturday ? to chart procedures for consideration of the new $275,00,000 GreekTurkish program and the $570 , - 000,000 China program . as the $5,300,000,000 . nuropean Recovery Program is being prepared for floor consideration in the Senate starting next Monday , March 1 . As to the Mediterranean front , Secretary Marshall emphasized , in his request for the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Greece and Turkey , and was " exclusive of any economic assistance , " such as would be provided under the Marshall Plan program . " The urgency of prompt action , " the Secretary of State went on . " is emphasized by the necessity for maintaining unbroken the supply lines from this country which support the Greek armed forces now in the field combatting the guerrillas . " Secretary Marshall did not mention Russia by name . However , he said : " Turkey has been under conI stant pressure to grant military bases in the Straits ( the Dardanelles ) to a foreign power and to cede to that same power Turkish territory in the Kars-Ardahan region . " The northern neighbors of Greece have furnished moral and material support to the Greek Communist guerrillas , who are attempting to overthrow the legal Greek Government and establish the dictatorship of a foreign inspired minority . This support is being continued in the face of a resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations last October . " Secretary Marshall related the aids given Greece since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relief and Rehabilitation Administration , the British Government and by the United States . He said that these efforts had " not been unavailing . " " Without them , I am convinced , Greece would not today be a sovereign nation , " he said . " They have not , however , accomplished what might have been hoped , primarily because the hostile forces determined to deprive Greece of her sovereignty have , with foreign assistance , intensified their efforts to spread chaos and disintegration .
