CAESARS IN GOOSESTEP - William D. <P> Bayles - Harper ( $3 ) . <P> William D. ( for David ) Bayles went to Germany in 1932 . He taught English for two years at the University of Munich , then free-lanced . In a little Munich cafe he used to see a " small , nervous , threadbare man with bad teeth , greasy , dandruffy hair , a colorless wisp of a mustache , and pale blue eyes which , like his hands , were never quiet . " It was Adolf Hitler . <P> Later in Berlin , Bayles ( as correspondent for TIME Inc. ) had a closer look at the little man . Bayles also paid close attention to the littler men who were Hitler 's chief lieutenants , and witnessed some of their works - the burning of the Reichstag , the June blood purge . Now &; again he would send a profile of one of them to LIFE or The New Yorker . They were portraits sketched with careful artlessness against the background of the subject 's weird biography and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book form under the title , Caesars in Goosestep . All the little Caesars were there with their records up to date . There was Dr. Paul Josef Goebbels , whom his fellow Rhinelanders call " Jupkin " ( insignificant little Joe ) , and who is so non-Aryan-looking that a policeman once tried to stop him from entering a Nazi rally . " Better not go in there , buddy , " said the cop . " They 're all anti-Semites . " There was the only normal Nazi , Rudolf Hess , called " Fraulein " because he is hysterical Hitler 's nursemaid and governess . There was the ex-wine salesman , Joachim von Ribbentrop , who used to be much in demand for amateur theatricals in the homes of rich and cultured Jews , because he played effete Englishmen in Oscar Wilde plays . There was Gestapo Chief Heinrich Himmler , about whom the Munich police in 1923 made a mistake his secret police would never make . They thought he was so unimportant they did not arrest him . There was Hitler 's brutal Labor Boss Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Dr. Ley . . . was sitting at the head of a long table slopped with spilt beer and wine , and strewn with cigar and cigarette butts , broken glass , bread crusts and the remains of meals . He was in a soiled brown uniform and his huge , florid face and baldish head were streaked with blood because he had cut his hand on a broken glass and then wiped the blood over his face and into his hair . " There is a timely last chapter on the Reichswehr generals . Though more &; more under the Nazi thumb , they are still the most independent group in the Third Reich . For by winning or losing the war , it is still the generals who will finally decide the fate of their goose-stepping Caesars and most of mankind .
