" I who know the smallness of my voice and the tiny stink of all our journalistic voices repeated wonder if any words of mine could matter much . . . . " <P> This modest if rhetorical utterance is characteristic of florid , balding , loquacious Stark Young , who has been a discerning critic of art and the theater ( in the New Republic and elsewhere ) for some 20 years . Stark Young is known also as a best-selling novelist ( So Red The Rose ) , a poet , a playwright , a translator of plays and a lecturer . Last week he made a firm bid to be known as a painter , gave his first exhibition at Manhattan 's Friends of Greece , Inc . <P> Like most of the events in Stark Young 's life , this one was a shooting of the most fashionable rapids . He opened the proceedings with a lecture to 53 lady friends of Greece and art , including the Marquise de Talleyrand-Perigord , Countess di Zoppola , Countess Mercati . Mrs. Vincent Astor , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Stark Young takes a view of art which is wanning to those tired of abstruse and cerebral esthetics . Says he : " In my opinion a picture should be nostalgic with all we love and follow after in life ; but ... it should have finally within it a calm and harmony as if it had arrived at a completeness in itself and its own peace . " Young 's work in no way suggested that he had been painting for only two years . His solid , slightly impressionistic flower pieces indicated close study of the still-life masters by a man who loves nature as well as art . That Stark Young also loves literature and history was somewhat fruitily evident in his precious titles and subtitles lifted from Francis Thompson , Racine , Leopardi , etc . To Garland of the Garland ( credit line : Meleager , in the Greek Anthology ) , in which a morose young woman in a long white dress sulks on a wall while a garlanded youth wipes his ear with a towel , Stark Young appended a welcome note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beautiful as the magazines . He has been making garlands , and to him she is the garland 's very soul . " Polyglot as his influences are , most of Young 's subjects are native . <P> " Very Very Southern . " Stark Young is known to his friends as an ardent garden er , a collector of objets d'art , " a character , " a wit and a superb teller of un printable stories . He was born in Como , Miss , in 1881 . Papa Young was a doctor who , says Stark , would have preferred the role of Southern planter of which the Civil War deprived him . Mama Young was ' ' very very Scotch , and very very Southern . " Stark Young , as his romanticism and rhetoric show , is pretty Southern him self . <P> He entered the University of Missis sippi when he was only 14 ( his prep school had closed because of typhoid spread when a pig fell down a cistern ) . <P> He later took a Columbia M.A. , spent eleven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , five more at Amherst . In Italy , which he has visited about 18 times , he used to " go to the galleries the moment the doors opened and stay there all day . " If his painting matches the quality of his dramatic criticism , it will be something .
