One day seven years ago , the University of Notre Dame campus experienced the nearest thing to an earthquake it had known in 107 years of history . By order of suave , iron-willed Football Coach Frank Leahy , the revered Notre Dame shift , perfected by the great Knute Rockne and immortalized by such Notre Dame heroes as Christy Flanagan and the Four Horsemen , was unceremoniously junked . To replace it , Leahy wheeled in the T-formation . <P> In the mutinous uproar at South Bend , buildings seemed to tremble-but none crumbled . All that happened was that Notre Dame , operating from Leahy 's new T , became more devastating than ever . In 49 games , against the most rugged opponents that could be found , Leahy 's T-men rolled up an awesome record of 42 victories , 4 ties , only 3 defeats . Last week , Coach Leahy bared a few of his T-secrets and coaching tricks in his new book Notre Dame Football-The T-Formation ( Prentice-Hall ; $3 ) . <P> Up Two &; Opposite . To the layman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical quiz-kid can comprehend it , much less play it . At Notre Dame , even the basic quick-opener , known as " 43 " or " the bread &; butter play " ( see chart ) , has a maze of variations . When the Notre Dame quarterback has called the play number ( " 43 " signifies that the " No. 4 " back is to ram through the " No. 3 " hole ) and the team has swung out of the huddle , Leahy 's tackles have about two seconds to size up the position of the defensive team . <P> Then both tackles call signals for blocking assignments on the play . It sounds confusing , but to good T-men it is n't ; on a play to the right side of the line , the players listen only to the right tackle , and let the left tackle chatter his deception signals unheeded . If the right tackle sees the " 3 hole " is clogged , he may cry " Up two , " and play " 43 " becomes " 45 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , he may shout " Cancel , " whereupon the quarterback calls " Opposite , " and the play hammers at the other side of the line . Obviously , Notre Dame tackles need to be quick-witted as well as big . <P> Leahy switched to the T mainly because of its flexibility , then made his version the most flexible in existence . The trick is to hit from one formation - with quick-openers , mousetraps , fullback laterals , passes - catching the enemy where he is weakest at the instant the play begins . <P> Mirrors &; Backboards . To be able to master the T , says Leahy , his boys must first kindle a " burning desire " to learn . One of his psychological stunts consists of having a player look into a mirror and ask himself " if he is giving 100% for his teammates and his school . " Since deception is the crux of the T , faking is pounded into Notre Dame backs along with the other fundamentals . In practicing fakes , Leahy 's quarterbacks must almost deceive themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faking to so intently that , afterwards , they can tell Coach Leahy how many fingers the other fellow had extended .
