It was Riom reversed . In 1942 Vichy-france had brought the fallen Third Republic to trial . Now , in Paris , a representative of fallen Vichy stood before the High Court of the " Fourth Republic . " The charge was the same as at Riom : betrayal of the nation . <P> To prosecute the Government of Marshal Henri Philippe Petain , the Government of General Charles de Gaulle called from retirement the scourge of World War I 's spies and traitors . At 75 , famed Counselor Andre Mornet was tired , bent and heavy-eyed . His frayed red robe might have been the one he wore at the Mata Hari trial . But when he rose , red of face and white of beard , to open the case against Vichy , his years fell away , his old fire flashed . <P> This time the defendant was no Mata Hari . It was Vichy 's bewhiskered , palsied , senescent ( 64 ) Jean-Pierre Esteva , the five-star admiral who had been Marshal Petain 's Resident General of Tunisia . Cried Counselor Mornet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be brought to trial in absentia . Esteva did not resist the Germans in Tunisia ; instead , he appealed to the Free French to desert , conscripted Tunisians to help the Axis . " I ask death for the man who was content to accept dishonor . " <P> To the prisoner 's dock stumbled the defendant . He poured out garrulous excuses : " The Germans were blackguards . I hated them . I want to fight them now . I ask permission to continue in the war to the end-if God permits-with weapons in my hands , at the most dangerous and exposed position at the front that is possible , in the most humble grade , even as a plain sailor . . . . " <P> But in Tunisia what could he have done ? " I sacrificed everything for France . . . . Some people asked me why I did not go to Algiers or to England and join the Free French . But what would I have been with the Free French ? I would not have been Resident General of Tunisia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have been just Monsieur Esteva . " <P> With averted , shame-filled eyes his fellow Frenchmen listened . Swiftly the three judges and 24 jurors , mostly men of the Resistance , rendered their judgment : for Traitor Esteva not death but life imprisonment , confiscation of his possessions . loss of his five stars . <P> In the courtroom 's silence the prisoner clutched his gold-braided cap , turned his face toward dishonor , mumbled : " I would have preferred death . "
